         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no man that can plead Ignorance to the univerſal Decree of God concerning the neceſsity of Mans Mortality: <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die:</hi> and every man can ſay as that wiſe Woman of <hi>Tekoaeh, we are all as water ſpilt upon the ground.</hi> There is no Age, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, Condition, or rank of Men, but have been foyled with that invincible Champion Death; who riding up and down the World upon his pale Horſe above theſe five thouſand years, hath with an impartial ſtroke laid all flat before him; ſome in there Infancy have proved what it is to die before they knew what it was to live; others in the ſtrength of Youth; ſome in their old Age: rich and poor, high and low, of all ſorts; young men may die, old men muſt die; even thoſe that are ſtiled Gods (and that by no fawning Sycophant, but by God himſelf) their Mortality proves them to be men to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though they be as Gods to others: and as <hi>Epictetus</hi> once told the Emperour, <hi>That to be born, and to die, was common both to Prince and Beggar.</hi> The ſickneſſes and miſeries of this World have made the proudeſt <hi>Painims</hi> to confeſs with St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, Even I my ſelf alſo am a mortal man:</hi> So that experience (as well as Scripture) concludes, <hi>what man is he that liveth and ſhall not ſee death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are no ingredients in the ſhop of Nature that are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently cordial to fortifie the heart againſt this King of terrors or his harbingers: the velvet ſlipper cannot ſence the foot from <pb facs="tcp:47453:3"/>the gout, nor the gold ring the finger from a fellon; the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diadem cannot quit the head-ach, nor the purple Robe prevent a Fever: Beauty, ſtrength, riches, honour, friends, nor any, nor all can repeal that ſentence, <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> Every fit of an Ague, and every diſtemper of this frail conſtitution being as a light skirmiſh before the main battel of Death, wherein weak man being vanquiſhed, is led captive to his long home: and when once the lines of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality are drawn upon the face of the faireſt mortal, he becomes a ghaſtly ſpectacle (how lovely ſoever before) and the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, <hi>Bury my dead out of my ſight.</hi> This inevitable neceſsity, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be confeſſed and acknowledged of all; yet lamentable experience teacheth, that in the Chriſtian world moſt men ſo live as though they ſhould never die, and at length they ſo die as though they ſhould never live again, and when the time of their diſſolution cometh, their ſouls are rather chaſed out by violence, then yielded to God in obedience.</p>
            <p>Indeed to a wicked man, Death is the <hi>beginning of ſorrows,</hi> it is a trap-door to let him down to the everlaſting dungeon of Hell; but the children of God (though they cannot ſcape the ſtroke, yet) they are freed from the ſting of death, they can play upon the hole of this Aſpe without danger, and welcome the grimmeſt approach of this Gyant with a ſmile, being freed from the hurt of him, by <hi>Him</hi> that is the <hi>Captain of the Lords Hoſt, who hath aboliſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light;</hi> ſo that the ſting of it being plucked out, and the ſuffering ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Chriſt, death is become to every Believer but a <hi>dark entry</hi> to the glorious Pallace of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as it is Gods tender mercy to his Children, that their conflict and miſery ſhould be temporary, but their perfect happineſs eternal; ſo it ſhould be their care in this little ſpace of time alotted them, (whereupon their everlaſting condition depends) ſo to provide that they may live happily where they ſhall live eternally: and ſince we cannot eſcape death, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it, that we may get the ſight of this Baſilisk before it approach, and ſo avoid the danger of it. Wretched is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of that man, who when theſe ſpiritual <hi>Philiſtims</hi> (the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of death) make war upon him, ſhall have juſt cauſe to ſay, <hi>The Lord is departed from me:</hi> the death of ſuch a one will be like the ſleep of a frantick man, who when the malignant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor <pb facs="tcp:47453:3"/>is concocted, awakes in a greater rage than he lay down; whereas to him that is wiſe to conſider his latter end, death is no way dreadful; death may kill him, but it cannot hurt him; it doth free him from temporary miſery, but cannot hinder him from eternal felicity: and as that noble Captain of <hi>Thebes,</hi> who having gotten the victory over his enemies, but withal, received his mortal wound, he made this his grand enquiry, <hi>whether his weapons were ſafe or not? whether his buckler was not in his enemies hands?</hi> and when it was replied all was ſafe, he died with a great deal of chearfulneſs and fortitude. So when a Chriſtian is to grapple with death, his main care is, that his Buckler of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Helmet of his <hi>Salvation,</hi> his <hi>Hope,</hi> that they be ſafe to guard his Soul, and then he paſſeth not much what becomes of his outward man, he dies in peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
            <p>Now that we may be fitted to encounter with this laſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, (beſides the manifold helps which God hath reached to us in his Word, in the paſſages of his providence, in the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent examples of mortality before us continually, and in our own ſenſible approaches to the gates of death; I ſay, beſides theſe and infinite more,) this enſuing Volumn (with ſo much care and pains compiled) by Gods bleſsing, and our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, may prove no ſmall furtherance in our Pilgrimage; <hi>Each Sermon therein being as a ſeveral Legaſie bequeathed by thoſe, upon the occaſion of whoſe deaths they were Preached, as by ſo many Teſtators, who themſelves have made a reall experiment of Mortality, and left theſe for our inſtruction that ſurvive them.</hi> It is true, the dayly examples of Mortality are ſo many real Lectures, that by a kind of dumb Oratory perſwade us to expect our end, but as they are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient, ſo our thoughts of them vaniſh; therefore it can be no ſmall advantage to have in continual readineſs that which may furniſh us abundantly with meditations in this kind.</p>
            <p>It was a cuſtome in former times for men to make their Sepulchres in their Gardens, to mind them of death in the midſt of the pleaſures of this life. This preſent Work may not unfitly be termed a Garden, wherein whoſoever takes a dayly walk, may gather in the ſeveral beds thereof thoſe wholſome flowers and hearbs, which being diſtilled by ſerious meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will prove water of life to a fainting ſpirit: in ſome he ſhall find inſtruction, in ſome incitation, in others conſolali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <pb facs="tcp:47453:4"/>in all profit. Here thou ſhalt find that <hi>Lethall Gourd</hi> ſprung up by <hi>Adam</hi> his trauſgreſsion, that makes all his poſterity cry out, <hi>There is Death in the Pot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There thou mayſt gather Hearbs of Grace, as a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſon againſt the malignity of death: in a third there is the ſpiritual <hi>Heliotropium</hi> opening with joy to the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the hope of a bleſſed Reſurrection. Do the glittering ſhews of outward things make thee begin to over-fancy them? here thou ſhalt find how little they will avail in death: the conſideration whereof will make them like that precious ſtone which being put into the mouth of a dead man loſeth its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: art thou over-burthened with afflictions? here thou art ſupported in the expectation of <hi>a far more exceeding weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> art thou ready to faint under thy labours? here thou ſhalt find a time of reſt, and of reaping: doth the time ſeem over-long, that thy patience begins to flag? here thou haſt a promiſe of thy Saviours ſpeedy coming: In a word, be thy eſtate and condition what it will be; here thou mayſt have both directions to guide thee, and comforts to ſupport thee in thy journey on earth, till thou arrive at thy Country in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Certainly, there is no man can ſleight and undervalue ſo deſerving a Work, but he ſhall diſcover himſelf either to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, or idle, or ill affected; eſpecially when ſo judicious and learned men have thought it a fit concomitant for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Labours, which they have added for the accompliſhment of it: Therefore take it in good worth, improve it for the good of thy Soul; that being armed and prepared for death when it ſhall approach; thou mayſt have no more to do but to die, and mayſt end thy dayes in a ſtedfaſt aſſurance, <hi>That thy ſins ſhall be blotted out, when the time of Refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the LORD.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Chapter going before,
<note place="margin">The coherence.</note> our bleſſed Lord and Saviour had preached the Doctrine of the Free Grace of God in the Remiſſion of Sin, and receiving of Repenting and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Sinners, in the Parable of an indulgent Fathers receiving of a prodigal Son. The Phariſees were a People that hardned their own hearts, and ſcoffed at every thing that Chriſt delivered: therefore now in this Chapter, he cometh to ſummon and warn them to appear before God, the great Maſter of the world, to <hi>give an account of their ſtewardſhip;</hi> that by the conſideration of Gods proceeding in the day of Judgment, they might know the better how to prize the Remiſſion of Sins in the day of Grace; This he doth, by preſenting to them a Parable, of a certain <hi>rich man,</hi> that had <hi>a ſteward who was accuſed unto him, that he had waſted his goods,</hi> calleth him to an <hi>account:</hi> and to the end that the Phariſees might not think that it was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be jeſted withal, and that ſuch conſiderations as theſe were to be ſlighted; he telleth them, how the <hi>unjuſt ſteward</hi> having received this ſummons and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Maſter, that he muſt come to a reckoning, he forthwith for his own temporal good, caſteth about that he may the better be fitted to give up his <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:</hi> thereby teaching them, and in them all the world, that if this <hi>ſteward</hi> here, (for his own temporal benefit) was thus careful to prepare himſelf, how much more ſhould they, and every one be careful to prepare themſelves for that great day of Account, wherein God will come to judge the World, and bring to light all things that are hid in darkneſs.</p>

               <p>In this verſe then that I have read, you ſee here is firſt the Summons or warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Give an account:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the reaſon of that Sammons, <hi>for thou mayeſt be no longer Steward,</hi> The day is ended, now <hi>give an account</hi> of thy work thou muſt go out of thy office; <hi>now give an account</hi> how thou haſt behaved thy ſelf in thy office: thou muſt be no longer ſteward; therefore <hi>give an account of thy ſtewardſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt, the Summons and calling of this <hi>Steward</hi> to an <hi>Account,</hi> ye have clearly offered to ye theſe two Propoſitions, Conſiderations, of Concluſions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Proſpoſ.</hi> Every man in the world is Gods Steward.</note> That every man in the World is Gods Steward.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, That every one of Gods Stewards muſt be brought to a reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, (I ſay) <hi>Every man in the World is Gods Steward.</hi> If ye ask me who it is that is called a <hi>Steward:</hi> The text tels ye, that it is he that <hi>muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> to his Maſter.</p>
               <p>If you ask me who is the Maſter? It is God. If then God be the Maſter, and if every man muſt <hi>give an account</hi> and reckoning to God, then every man is the <hi>Steward</hi> here intended in this Text. That every man muſt give a reckoning to God, it appeareth 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgement ſeat of Chriſt, to give an account of the things me have done in this life, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be good or evil.</hi> All men: That which is here expreſſed by the Apoſtle in plain terms, <hi>All men.</hi> Is more parrabollically and obſcurely expreſſed by Chriſt in this word <hi>Steward. Give an account of thy Stewardſhip.</hi> So that the <hi>Concluſion</hi> remaineth clear, and is directly gathered from the Text. <hi>That every man in the World is Gods Steward.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proved.</note> There is no man or woman in the world, but in ſome reſpect or other, is the <hi>Steward</hi> here, that muſt be called to an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That every man is a <hi>Steward,</hi> will appear if we conſider two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what every man receiveth from God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what God expects from every man.</p>
               <p>Man receiveth from God, that which a Steward doth from his Lord.</p>
               <p>God expects from every man, that which a Lord expects from his Steward.</p>
               <p>Firſt (I ſay) man receiveth from God that which a Steward doth from his Maſter:
<note place="margin">1. By what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one receiveth from God.</note> That is, ſuch goods, ſuch abilities, as whereby he may be of uſe for ſuch a place, as the Maſter ſhall ſet him in the family. All the World is but Gods great Family, all the fittings and endowments of men, are the talents, the gifts, that God hath intruſted men with: ſome have the gifts of the world, riches, and places of authority, theſe are gifts committed to thoſe kind of <hi>Stewards:</hi> Others have the gifts of the body, as health and ſtrength, their ſenſes, and lives, and the like: theſe are gifts committed to theſe kind of <hi>Stewards:</hi> others have the gifts of the mind, underſtanding, and wiſdome, and policy: and to all theſe ſome have ſpiritual graces. According as men are furniſhed with theſe gifts, and according to their ſeveral qualifications with theſe endowments, they all receive them from God as <hi>Stewards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. By what God expects from every one</note> if we conſider what God expects from men: he expects that which a Lord doth from his Steward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:47453:8"/>
Firſt, that they acknowledge him to be the chief, to acknowledge that they hold all from him, that they have it not from themſelves or for themſelves, this is that which every Maſter expects from him to whom he committeth his treaſure: And this would God have all men do. God ſpeaks that truly that <hi>Benhadad</hi> ſpake proudly, and falſly to the King of Iſrael: <hi>thy ſilver is mine, and thy gold is mine,
<note place="margin">Pſal: 24: 1.</note> and thy daughters and wives are mine, and thy vineyards and thy orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards are mine.</hi> So may God ſay truly, All are his, <hi>the earth</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) is the Lords and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> He is the great poſſeſſor of all things.</p>
               <p>God (as he poſſeſſeth all things) ſo he letteth out parcels of his poſſeſſions to the ſons of men. To ſome a larger portion of the earth than to others, yet they are but Tenants at will; and Tenants upon certain conditions and reſervations, wherein this great Lord bindeth thoſe that hold any thing of him.</p>
               <p>And the firſt Condition,
<note place="margin">Men do not waſte his goods</note> or Reſervation that he ties all his <hi>Stewards</hi> unto, is this, that they waſte not his goods, that they ſcatter them not abroad vainly or unprofitably. Now a man that hath riches, if he relieveth not the poor: a man that hath authority, and helpeth not the oppreſſed: a man that hath wiſdome, and inſtructeth not the ignorant. In a word, A man that hath any abilities, if he be not of uſe unto others with it, this man ſcattereth his Maſters goods, and is like that <hi>unprofitable ſervant, that hid his Talent in a napkin,</hi> and therefore was <hi>bound hand and foot, and caſt into utter darkneſs.</hi> This was the accuſation that was brought againſt this <hi>Steward</hi> here, that <hi>he had waſted the goods of his Lord;</hi> that is, that he had ſpent them vainly, he was no honour to his Maſter, there came no profit to the houſhold by it. That's the firſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that this great Lord expects of all his <hi>Stewards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. That they do not abuſe them to ill ends.</note> is, that as they do not ſcatter his goods, nor vainly waſte them, ſo that they ſhould not abuſe them to ill ends. There are a generation of men in the world that fight againſt God with his own weapons, and that uſe all their ſtrength, and wiſdome, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, to maintain a faction of rebellion againſt him: that ſide with the wicked of the world againſt his Laws and Ordinances: and this is the greateſt unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that can be. If a King ſhould raiſe a ſervant to honour, and beſtow offices and dignities upon him, and yet if he ſhould raiſe an Army againſt him, and ſet himſelf againſt all his Laws, What greater unthankfulneſs? What greater enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
<note place="margin">Luke 19: 27.</note> Therefore it was the ſpeech of that parrabolical King in <hi>Luke</hi> 19. (which is Chriſt the King of the Church) <hi>theſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould reign over them, bring them hither, and ſtay them before me.</hi> Such is the ſtate of all thoſe men that have wealth and abuſe it,
<note place="margin">James 4: 3.</note> 
                  <hi>conſume it upon their luſts,</hi> (as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks) upon their pride, in exceſs in apparel, meats; &amp;c. that have wit, and ſpend it like <hi>Turtullus</hi> to cry down the wayes of God, to harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others in the courſe of ſin: that have greatneſs and authority, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imploy it to the cruſhing of good perſons, and good cauſes: theſe and the like are <hi>Stewards</hi> that abuſe their Maſters goods, miſ-imploy them to his diſhonour, theſe Chriſt counteth his enemies, and he will not bear it.</p>
               <p>There is a third thing that God expects of all his <hi>Stewards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3: To do him Homage.</note> and that is this, that they ſhould do him Homage, that they ſhould appear at his Court dayes. Gods Sabbaths are Gods Court dayes, wherein he calleth and aſſembleth his ſervants together. He will have every one to wait there upon him, that they may know his will: as <hi>Cornelius</hi> bringeth his family together, and ſaith he, <hi>We are all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to hear what is commanded thee of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 10: 33.</note> So God (I ſay) will have his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants preſent at his Court dayes: and not only ſo, not only to be preſent there, to here his will, and to underſtand his mind, but to ſubmit to his orders, to yeeld obedience to his Laws, to be governed by his rules. God hath certain rules to which he will have every man ſubject, there be rules for Magiſtrates, for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, for Maſters, for Parents, for Servants, for Children, for all: and he is a rebel, and carrieth not himſelf as Gods <hi>Steward,</hi> that doth not keep the rules that God hath ſet up in his own houſe.</p>
               <note place="margin">4: To return him fruit.</note>
               <p>Again fourthly; God expects this from all his Stewards, that whenſoever he <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47453:9"/>ſendeth his Bayliffs for rent, that they return him the fruit of his own ground. Every ſoul is Gods ground, from which God expects ſome fruit or other, and he ſends his Bayliffs, his Servants, continually to gather theſe fruits from men. When he ſends a poor man to the rich, there's a Bayliff ſent to him, to gather ſome fruit of his wealth. When he ſends an oppreſſed man to thoſe that are in authority, there's a Bayliff ſent to him, to gather the fruit of his power and greatneſs. When he ſends an ignorant man to thoſe that have wiſdom and knowledg, there's a Bayliff ſent to him, to gather the fruit of his Knowledge. And ſo we may ſay of all things whatſoever: whatſoever endowments of body, or mind, or eſtate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man hath, if another need it, that other is Gods Bayliff, ſent to him to call for his rent, to call for the fruit of his ground, and thou muſt return it by ſuch a one, for thou art but a <hi>Steward:</hi> and you know how fearful the proceedings of the great King was in Matt. 21.
<note place="margin">Matt. 21.33.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſent his ſervants to the Husbandmen,</hi> to thoſe to whom he had let out his ground, to receive the fruits of it, and there was none; what was the iſſue of it? <hi>He was full of wrath: and cometh upon the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen and ſlew them.</hi> So when God ſhall ſend the poor to thee for relief, and thou helpeſt him not: ſhall ſend the ignorant to thee for inſtruſtion, and thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeſt him not: ſhall ſend any one to thee that may have uſe of thy gifts and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and thou doeſt not imploy them that way, thou denieſt the great Lord the fruit of his own ground, and art of the number of thoſe Husband-men that muſt expect this at his hands to be ſlain in his wrath.</p>
               <p>Ye ſee the Point opened, That all men are Gods <hi>Stewards,</hi> both in reſpect of what God hath beſtowed on them, and what God doth expect from them.</p>
               <p>I come briefly now to make ſome uſe of this.</p>
               <p>Are all men Gods <hi>Stewards?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> Then certainly there is ſome work required of every man in the world by vertue of this title put upon him, that he is Gods <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</hi> It concerns therefore, Every one to look to his place.</p>
               <p>There are two things required of every <hi>Steward.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a Steward.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, a diſpenſation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a right ordering of his diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>Firſt a Diſpenſation.
<note place="margin">1. Diſpenſation</note> For a <hi>Steward</hi> ye know is appointed for laying out, he is made for others, not for himſelf, for the good of the Family in which he is ſet, not for his own benefit. God hath made every creature to be for the uſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not for it ſelf: thoſe heavenly bodies, the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, their motion and influences are for us, for the ſervice of the world: the Earth with the fruits of it; the Beaſts, and all are for the ſervice of man. So every man in his ſeveral place, hath ſome work to do for others, ſome abilities given him for the ſervice of others.
<note place="margin">Rom: 13: 4.</note> Hence it is, that the Magiſtrate is ſaid to be <hi>the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God for the peoples good.</hi> Hence it is, that Miniſters are ſaid to be <hi>the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Churches.</hi> I am <hi>a debtour</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) to the Jew, and to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom: 1: 14.1 Tim: 5: 8.</note> to the <hi>Greeks, and to the Barbarians.</hi> Hence it is, that a Maſter of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is ſaid to be <hi>worſe than an Infidel,</hi> if he provide not for thoſe of his own houſe. And every other Chriſtian (though he ſtand not in theſe relations to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) he hath ſome gifts or other, that are to be laid forth for the uſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of others, and every private perſon in the world, he may be of ſome uſe or other in the place in which he is ſet. Hence it is, that the name of <hi>Brother</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Chriſtians, and ye know <hi>Joſeph</hi> acknowledged that he was preferred to thoſe honours, and that authority and place, for the good of his Brethren, for his Fathers houſe: ſo ſhould all Gods' people acknowledge other Chriſtians their Brethren, and that whatſoever parts they have, they have them for the good of the Family. Hence it is, that Chriſtians are called <hi>Members</hi> one of another; Every Member is of uſe to the whole body, ſo muſt every Chriſtian be of uſe to another, to ſome by the riches of the body, to ſome by the riches of the mind, to ſome by the abilities of their eſtates, every one according to the treaſure he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with, and the Talent that is committed to him.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt thing, that men muſt make conſcience to do, to be diſpencers <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47453:9"/>of their goodneſs, of any thing they have, to be communicative, to defuſe and extend themſelves to others, as occaſion ſhall be offered. And indeed where there is any goodneſs in a man, he will expreſs it this way, by doing all the good to others he can.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Right orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his diſpenſations.</note> it is required of a <hi>Steward,</hi> that he conſider of the manner, and right ordering of his diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>There be two Rules for that.</p>
               <p>That he diſpenſe 
<list>
                     <item>Faithfully.</item>
                     <item>Wiſely.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Who (ſaith the Lord in that 12 <hi>Luke</hi> 42.) is a <hi>faithful and wiſe Steward,
<note place="margin">Luk. 12.42.</note> whom his Lord ſhall make ruler over his houſhold, &amp;c.</hi> Gods <hi>Stewards</hi> ye ſee muſt in their diſpenſations be faithful and wiſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they muſt be faithful.</p>
               <p>Fidelity appears in this,
<note place="margin">1. Faithfully.</note> when they have a right End, and a right Rule to walk by.</p>
               <p>What is the End and Rule of a faithful <hi>Steward</hi> in all his diſpenſations in the houſe of his Maſter?</p>
               <p>His Maſters credit, and his Maſters will; His Maſters honour, and his Maſters command.</p>
               <p>So it muſt be in the houſe of God. If we would be faithful in our places, let Gods glory be our end, and his Word our rule. That is, let a man conſider, what God in his Word commands him in ſuch a place, in ſuch a qualification, having ſuch endowments, ſuch parts, ſuch abilities, and let him diſpenſe theſe by that Rule, according to that Command, to the glory of God that gave them him. Thus was <hi>Moſes</hi> a faithful <hi>Steward, faithful as a ſervant in all the houſe of God,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle ſaith of him,
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5. His Maſters glory was his end, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when once he ſaw his Maſter diſhonoured by <hi>Idolatry,</hi> he could not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf,
<note place="margin">Exod. 32.19.</note> but his <hi>Anger waxed hot,</hi> though <hi>he was the meekeſt man upon earth.</hi> And his Maſters Will was his Rule, therefore he came down from the Mountain with the Tables in his hand, that it might appear what he made his guide, and direction in all his carriage amongſt the people: and we ſhall find that in all the doubts of the people, either in matter of Command or puniſhment, he alwayes ſought direction from God. He is no faithful Servant that doth not do this.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. VViſely.</note> As he muſt be a faithful <hi>Steward</hi> in diſpenſing, ſo he muſt be wiſe in his diſpenſing too.</p>
               <p>What is the wiſdom of Gods <hi>Stewards?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not the wiſdom drawn from the writings of <hi>Machivile,</hi> or the wiſdome of the World,
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.7.</note> or of the fleſh, <hi>for that is enmity againſt</hi> God, not drawn from the rules that politicians walk by: But that wiſdome that is drawn out of the Scriptures, the Word of God:
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The Word of God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is able to make the man of God wiſe to ſalvation:</hi> this is the wiſdom that Gods ſervants muſt expreſs, and manifeſt in diſpenſing of their gifts, they muſt be made wiſe by the Word, they muſt ſeek wiſdom from the Word the rule of Wiſdom, from the Examples in the Word, of thoſe that were guided by the Spirit of Wiſdom, if they would be wiſe <hi>Stewards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They muſt compare the precepts of the Word,
<note place="margin">Gen: 18.19</note> and the practiſe of the Saints to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: ſee what God commandeth in ſuch a place, in ſuch a condition, ſee what Gods ſervants that are gone before have done in ſuch a condition. Mark how <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and others of Gods Saints have imployed their wealth and authority, it was for the relieving of the poor, for the furtherance of Gods glory, for the eaſe of thoſe that were oppreſt: Mark how <hi>Nehemiah</hi> beſtirred himſelf for the ſanctifying of the Sabbath, for the furtherance of Gods worſhip: Mark again how St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as a Miniſter watched againſt the Wolves, and how he ſpends himſelf to the uttermoſt for the Church of God. Mark how <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47453:10"/>as a Maſter of a Family, governed his Family <hi>teaching and commanding his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and his houſhold to walk in the way of the Lord:</hi> Mark how other of Gods ſervants have imployed their gifts; As <hi>Sampſon,</hi> all his ſtrength for the Church: and ſo <hi>Solomon,</hi> all his wiſdom, and whatſoever gift any of them had, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the Talents that were committed to them, were for God, and for the ſervice of his Church, for the furtherance of his glory in the particular places that he had ſet them in. I ſay if men would be wiſe <hi>Stewards</hi> they muſt doe thus. But I cannot ſtand upon this, leſt I be prevented in that which I moſt intend in that that followeth.</p>
               <p>Ye have heard who is the <hi>Steward:</hi> It is every one that hath received any abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from God to do him ſervice; God expects that he ſhould employ that ability in his ſervice.</p>
               <p>We come now in the ſecond place to conſider the reckoning which every Man muſt make, the account that every man muſt give of his Stewardſhip. And that (as ye have heard) in the ſecond point of Doctrine that offers it ſelf to us out of the firſt part of the Text,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That all Gods Stewards muſt give a reckoning one time or other unto God.</p>
               <p>As every Man in the world is Gods Steward,
<note place="margin">All Gods ſtewards muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> ſo every Steward muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>In opening of this I will ſhew ye two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will ſhew ye what time of Reckoning God hath with his <hi>Stewards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I will ſhew ye why God judiciouſly proceedeth in this manner, called a Reckoning, or an Account.</p>
               <p>For the firſt.
<note place="margin">Two dayes of reckoning.</note> There are two times of Reckoning that God will have with his <hi>Stewards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt in this Life.</p>
               <p>The ſecond after death.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. In this life.</note> he calleth them to account in this life, while they live on the Earth, and that two ways;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>By his Word.</item>
                  <item>By his Rodd.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt, by his Word, haſtning every man to an Account by the Goſpel, and the Doctrine of Repentance.
<note place="margin">By the VVord.</note> This courſe God himſelf took with <hi>Adam,</hi> called him to account for his carriage in the Garden: <hi>Adam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>where art thou? who told thee that thou were naked?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen: 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>haſt thou eaten of the tree whereof I comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee that thou ſhouldeſt not eat?</hi> Afterwards when God ſent his Prophets into the World, they took the ſame courſe, ſo <hi>Elijah</hi> when he came to <hi>Ahab, haſt thou killed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King: 19.</note> 
                  <hi>and alſo taken poſſeſſion?</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, know that God hath found out thy ſin, and now calleth thee to a reckoning. So <hi>John Baptist,</hi> when he came to the Phariſees, and thoſe hard-hearted ſinners, he calleth them to a reckoning,
<note place="margin">Matt: 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Oh Generation of vipers, who hath warned ye to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> called thoſe three thouſand ſouls in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. to a Reckoning for crucifying of Chriſt; <hi>him (ſaith he) who is the Lord of life, ye have taken, and with wicked hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi>
               </p>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2.</note>
               <p>And becauſe there are many,
<note place="margin">By the rod.</note> that like the Adder, ſtop their ears at the voice of the Charmer; and if God ſpeak but in his Word, they paſs it by, as <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>job</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Job 33.14.</note> 
                  <hi>God ſpeaks once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not,</hi> therefore when the Word doth not prevail, God calleth them to a reckoning by his Rodd, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9.
<note place="margin">Mic: 6.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Hear the rodd, and him that appointeth it,</hi> that is: God hath appointed ſcourges and afflictions for men, to awake them to hearken to the voice that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them to a Reckoning.</p>
               <p>Now afflictions are outward or inward, corporal or ſpiritual. God ſometimes calleth men to an account by corporal afflictions: <hi>He ſmiteth man</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>with paines upon his bed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 33.19.</note> 
                  <hi>and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong pains.</hi> What's the reaſon of this, but that man may come to this concluſion with himſelf, that he may bring his own heart to a reckoning for his former carriage? This is that the <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47453:10"/>Apoſtle faith,
<note place="margin">1 Cor 11.30.</note> 
                  <hi>for this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep:</hi> ſome were taken with ſickneſs, upon others there was a conſuming weakneſs, and others were ſtrucken with death, what is the end that God propounds in all this? For this reaſon, <hi>that we ſhould judge our ſevles, for if we judge our ſelves, wee ſhall not be judged of the Lord, but when we are judged wee are chaſtned of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned of the world.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; God now calleth you to a reckoning in this life, to the end you may prevent that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and grievous one that comes after this life.</p>
               <p>Againe, when outward afflictions prevail not, God hath ſpiritual afflictions to awaken men. Thus <hi>David,</hi> when he was in a deepe ſleep of ſecuritie, God awakned him with a ſpiritual judgment: ſee his ſpeech in the 32 Pſal. <hi>When I kept cloſe my ſinnes my boues were conſumed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 31.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and I roared for the diſquietneſſe of my ſoul;</hi> what followed? God by this means brought him to confeſſion, <hi>I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my tranſgreſſions to the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the iniquitie of my ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus God in this life calleth men to a reckoning, ſometimes by the preaching of the Word, ſometimes by judgments upon the outward man, or by terrours upon the ſoule.</p>
               <p>But, if all this prevaile not to make a man reckon with himſelfe in this life, then God hath another reckoning after this life,
<note place="margin">2 After this life.</note> where every man muſt give an account, and cannot avoid it, and there he muſt abide the ſentence of the Judg, that would not prevent it before.</p>
               <p>That there is ſuch a Judgment to come it appeareth;</p>

               <p>Firſt (I ſay) in reſpect of God,
<note place="margin">1. In reſpect of God his decree Acts. 17.31. Iſa. 46.10.</note> there is a neceſſitie of it. That his Decree may be fulfilled and executed. <hi>Hee hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe. And his counſell ſhall ſtand, and he will doe all his pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">His honour.</note> it is neceſſary, that Gods honour may be vindicated. Now things ſeeme to go in ſome confuſion and diſorder in the world; good men, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are not alwayes beſt in the place of judgment,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>I have ſeene</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>an evil under the Sunne, that in the place of judgment wickedneſſe was there, and in the place of righteouſneſſe, that iniquitie was there;</hi> this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation <hi>Solomon</hi> makes, <hi>therefore I ſaid, God will bring to judgement every thing, both good and evill, for there is a time for every work, and every purpoſe.</hi> God hath a time to doe that great work that he hath now purpoſed: What is that work? that is to <hi>bring every work to judgement, whether it be good or evill.</hi> I ſay if we conſider this, it is neceſſary that there ſhould come a judgment, that ſhall ſet all right againe.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſarie likewiſe in reſpect of the Saints.</p>
               <p>The very tribulations of the Saints,
<note place="margin">2. In reſpect of the Saints. 2 Theſ. 1.5.</note> in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. are called <hi>Indigma,</hi> an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent demonſtration, or a manifeſt token of the righteous judgment of God.</p>
               <p>There is a neceſſitie of it in reſpect of them,
<note place="margin">For the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of their innocency</note> in two regards. Firſt, that there innocencie that is traduced here may be manifeſt. They undergoe many diſgraces, and hard cenſures amongſt men: the world accounts them proud, hypocrites, ſingular, fooliſh, vaine-glorious, and I know not what: now ſaith <hi>Iob, my witneſſe is in heaven;</hi> and ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, I care not to be judged of you, or of mans judgment; he that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi> The Word in the Greek is, <hi>mans day;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Men have their day here, but God hath a greater day after, the Lord will judg in another manner, and upon other grounds than men doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:47453:11"/>
Secondly,
<note place="margin">For the reward of their works.</note> it is neceſſary alſo, That their works may be rewarded. When we ſpeak of reward, wee meane not the reward of merit, wee meane the reward of grace, called a reward, becauſe God is tied to it by his promiſe. The ſervants of God, though they ſerve him with all care, they have not the fatt of the earth as ſometimes the Iſhmaels of the world have, they doe not abound with outward things as many others doe: nay, ſometimes they are in the worſt condition, and that makes Gods wayes the more deſpiſed, as if God were not able to maintaine his ſervants in the world in his wayes and worke. God therefore hath a time when his ſervants ſhall <hi>have full meaſure heaped up, preſſed down, ſhaken together, and running over.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 3.17.18</note> When God ſhall <hi>make up his jewels</hi> (as he ſaith in <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.) <hi>then ſhall yee diſcerne between the righteous and the wicked, between him that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth God, and him that ſerveth him not.</hi> Marke, <hi>yee ſhall diſcerne,</hi> God will make it appeare to the whole world, in the day when he <hi>makes up his jewels,</hi> that not withſtanding his ſervants are diſpiſed and lie here under divers preſſures, yet that they are a people whom he delights in, and accounteth as his treaſures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. In reſpect of the wicked.</note> it is neceſſarie in reſpect of the wicked too: that is, Firſt, that Gods righteouſneſſe may fully be manifeſted. Secondly, that their unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may fully bee puniſhed.
<note place="margin">For the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proceeding againſt them. Rom. 2.5.</note> Firſt I ſay, that Gods righteouſneſſe may fully bee manifeſted, therefore the day of Judgment in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. is called a <hi>day of wrath and revelation of the righteous Judgment of God:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: As God will manifeſt his wrath againſt the <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> ſo he will make it appear to the world, that he proceedeth in a right manner, and by a right rule in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>For wee muſt know, that howſoever God cannot bee unjuſt, and how ſoever that the ungodly men in this life contend with their owne conſciences, ſuch is the hardneſſe of their hearts, and abundance of corruption that they would faine juſtifie themſelves amongſt men: and againe, howſoever it bee true that the ſoule when it is departed out of the body is under Gods particular judgment by an intelectuall elevation of it, that it may receive the ſentence of the Judge, by an illumination, and by ſuch a ſpiritual, and contemplative diſcourſe, and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and underſtanding of Gods actions, as that by reflection upon it ſelfe, it may know it ſelfe to be accurſed, or acpuitted, and accordingly is entred into the poſſeſſion either of happineſſe or miſerie. Yet all this is ſecret in the world, till the day of Gods tribunall come, wherein <hi>ſecret things ſhall be made manifeſt,</hi> and things that have beene done in darkneſſe, ſhall appeare before men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
<note place="margin">For the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their puniſhment.</note> Secondly, Gods juſtice muſt be cleared, and fully manifeſted, ſo the wicked and unrighteous muſt be fully puniſhed; They are not fully puniſhed, when they are under the ſenſe of Gods wrath in this life, or when the ſoule is judged at death, there muſt be yet a further degree for all this. And there be theſe two reaſons for it.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, becauſe the wicked not only ſinne in ſoule, but in body too, the body hath beene the inſtrument of the ſoule in ſinning, and therefore it cannot ſerve the turne, that the ſoule is puniſhed, and the body lie in the grave; no, but thoſe that have joyned in ſin, muſt alſo joyne in Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Secondly, howſoever the ſinfull actions of the wicked are tranſcient, and ſeem to die with them, yet in reſpect of the contagion and evill effects, theſe actions worke upon others, and upon poſteritie bp the ill example of their predeceſſors; the actions, I ſay of thoſe wicked men continue to the day of Judgement. Thus wee ſhall ſee the <hi>Iewes,</hi> in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 44. revived the ſinnes of their fathers. <hi>Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> (ſay they) <hi>made cakes to the Queene of heaven, and ſo will wee.</hi> So the ſucceeding Kings of Iſrael, that went on in the ſteps of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who made <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to ſin, they continued the ſin of <hi>Ieroboam.</hi> As long as men goe on in the ſteps, and ſins of their forefathers, the ſins of their forefathers live. So that ſome mens ſinnes by a continued imitation, are perpetuated to the day of Judgment, therefore their muſt be a judgment then, that may fill up a meaſure proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their ſin. This was that that <hi>Dives</hi> feared in Hell, and that made him crie <pb n="9" facs="tcp:47453:11"/>out as he did, that <hi>one might goe and tell his bretheren upon earth,</hi> that they <hi>might not come into that place;</hi> Why would he have them tell his brethren? was there ſuch love to the kingdome of Chriſt in hell, that <hi>Dives</hi> would have his brethren converted? no ſuch matter. Was it love to the ſouls of his brethren, that he would not have them damned? no ſuch matter neither. What then? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was nothing elſe, but a ſence of his own guilt, he knew what evill example he had given, and what a counſeller he had been to his brethren, and if they ſhould go on in his ſteps, and their children follow the ſame ſteps, all this would but adde to his puniſhment, and torment in the great day, when ſoule and body ſhall be joyned together, to make up the full meaſure of their torment. For this reaſon, I ſay, it is therefore neceſſary that their ſhould be a judgement after this life, at the end of the world.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing remaineth,
<note place="margin">Why God is ſaid to call all men to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</note> and that is, why the holy Ghoſt expreſſeth Gods proceedings, by way of reckoning, or <hi>calling to an account?</hi> What need the Lord reckon with men, he may proceed by way of a Judge, but he ſaith, come give an account of thy <hi>Stewardſhip?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; There are four things implied in this, all ſhewing the manner of Gods proceedings, at the day of Judgment with his <hi>Stewards,</hi> that it ſhall be like the proeedings of a Maſter with his ſervants in an <hi>account</hi> and reckoning.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this,
<note place="margin">1. Becauſe he will proceed in particular.</note> that it ſhall be a proceeding in particulars. God ſhall then proceed not by groſſe ſums, and in the total; ye have done evil in the general: none will deal thus with an Accountant, but he will run over the particulars, and Account for pounds, for pence, for every thing. Thus God will deal with all his <hi>Stewards,</hi> when he bringeth them to a reckoning, he will reckon on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, for all things that he hath enabled them with for his ſervice.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are rich men;
<note place="margin">Job 27.18.</note> firſt, how they have gotten their eſtates, whether <hi>they have built their houſes as a moth,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, that is, raiſed their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, to the hurt of others, as men do that raiſe themſelves by uſury, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and fraud, and bribery, and ſuch like courſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how they have kept their wealth, whether with the injury of others <hi>with-holding the goods from the owners thereof,</hi> from the poor, for I call them in caſe of want the owners of their goods, becauſe God hath given them to his <hi>Stewards</hi> for their ſakes:
<note place="margin">Jam. 5.1.2:</note> therefore mark how Saint <hi>James</hi> expreſſeth it; <hi>Go to now yee rich men, weepe and houle, why ſo? your riches are corrupted, and your garments moth eaten, your gold and ſilver is cankered,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, you have been hoarding up your treaſures, you had rather be lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it up, then laying of it out, and therefore becauſe you have not laid out your eſtates for the ſervice of your maſter, <hi>ruſt is come upon your gola, and the moth hath eaten into your garments, ye have heaped treaſure together for the laſt day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, how they have ſpent what they have had, whether on their luſts or no; <hi>Ye ask and have not</hi> (faith S. <hi>James</hi>) <hi>becauſe ye ask amiſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James 4.3.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſpend it on your luſts;</hi> ſo ye lay out amiſs, ye ſpend it on your luſts. When men for pride in apparel, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe at their tables, for vain buildings, for ſinfull upholding of wickedneſſe, for unneceſſary, and injurious proceedings in law ſutes, or in what ſoever indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect courſe men lay out their eſtates, it is a miſ-ſpending of their Maſters goods. And as he that hath got his wealth unjuſtly, and he that keepeth it unjuſtly, ſhall <hi>give an account,</hi> ſo he that layeth it out in a confuſed, ſinful, profuſe way, ſhall be called <hi>to give a reckoning</hi> for that.</p>
               <p>And not only for matter of a eſtate, but beſides, for matter of place and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. <hi>Moſes</hi> knew this well enough, and therefore when he was to go out of the world, he firſt cleares all reckonings with the people of Iſrael: I have been a Ruler thus long, let any man come and ſtand up and ſay, I have done him wrong: let every man come &amp; clear me this day before the Lord, that I have walked all my life-time unblameably, inoffenſively, promoting the glory of God, and ſuppreſſing all the evill that I could with my might: this was the account that <hi>Moſes</hi> made with the people of Iſrael before he died, that he might <hi>lift up his head with <pb n="10" facs="tcp:47453:12"/>comfort in the day of the Lord.</hi> Thus it muſt be with you, ye muſt give an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of your places.</p>
               <p>And ſo for the ſtate of your bodies. The health thou haſt had: how haſt thou ſpent thy ſtrength and thy health? Mark the ſpeech of the Wiſe man to the young man, <hi>Rejoyce</hi> (faith he) <hi>in the dayes of thy youth;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: Doe if thou wilt; do if thou dare, but <hi>know that for all theſe things thou muſt come to judgment.</hi> Now thou haſt a great deale of health, a great deal of ſtrength, but haſt thou been the better for Gods ſervice? haſt thou imployed it fot Gods glory or no?</p>
               <p>And ſo for the members of thy body, thou muſt give an account for thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of thoſe inſtruments. Thy tongue: <hi>every idle word</hi> (faith Chriſt) <hi>that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give an account of, at the day of judgment.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> If for <hi>every idle word,</hi> what then for thy ſwearing and curſing, and lying? what for the abundance of filthy obſcene, and rotten communication that cometh out of thy mouth. Thou muſt give an account for thy tongue. And ſo for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry member and for every ſenſe, I cannot ſtand upon particulars.</p>
               <p>Thou muſt give an account likewiſe for the gifts of thy mind, how thou haſt imployed thy wiſdome and learning, and experience, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For all thy paſſions:
<note place="margin">Mat. 5 22.</note> 
                  <hi>he that is angry with his brother unadviſedly, is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all the diſpoſition,
<note place="margin">Mat. 15.19.</note> and inclinations of thy heart, <hi>for out of the heart cometh thefts and murthers, and adulteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, whatſoever ability thou haſt, whereby thou mighteſt have been beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, and ſerviceable to the Church and Common-wealth, thou muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it in particular unto God, he will call thee to a reckoning of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel by it ſelfe. The Maſter (in the Goſpel) that gave the talents to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, he called them to an account for every talent he gave them: ſo there muſt be a particular enumeration to God of all thoſe ſeverall abilities wherewith he hath fitted thee for his ſervice, how thou haſt behaved thy ſelfe in matter of health, ſtrength, and time; in thy ſenſes, in the members of thy body, how with thy mind, how with the diſpoſitions of thy ſoule, how in all the gifts and endowments he hath intruſted thee with, for the ſervice of the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Becauſe he will proceed by me hod and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> it is called a reckoning, becauſe in this reckoning, God will go by a method, keep an order, ſuch an order as men doe in reckoning with their accountants, every thing hath his due place: God will proceed to give every one in the day of judgment his due place; and ye ſhall find then, many ſinnes that ye have accounted the lighteſt of all, will be the moſt heavieſt, and grievous at that day.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſet thy ſinnes in order before thee,</hi> ſaith God in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. He had reckoned them up confuſedly here, <hi>theſe things thou haſt done,</hi> but, <hi>I will ſet them in order before thee.</hi> God will obſerve ſuch an order, as every thing ſhall have its due place, its due head.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place ſhall be that Apoſtacie, whereof all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity are guilty. This <hi>David</hi> ſaw, and therefore when he judged himſelfe, he judged himſelfe as one born in ſinne.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>I was borne in ſinne, and in ſinne hath my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceived me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place ſhall bee that concupiſcence, that depravation of nature, from whence all actual ſinnes proceed.
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> This Saint <hi>Paul</hi> knew, and therefore he bewaileth it as the original, and root of all other actual ſinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. God will begin firſt with the ſins of the heart, becauſe thence cometh all the outward actions of the whole man.</p>
               <p>Then all the outward actions. Hee will begin firſt with thoſe againſt the firſt Table, Atheiſme, Infidelity, Prophaneneſſe, contempt of God, and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, neglect of his glory, and the opportunites he hath given us.</p>
               <p>And when the Law and the Goſpel come together, he will proceed more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, for the ſinnes againſt the Goſpel, then the Law. That is the reaſon <pb n="11" facs="tcp:47453:12"/>that our Saviour telleth us, that it ſhall be <hi>eaſier for Sodome and Gomorah, then Capernaum at the day of Iudgment.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> had the Law, but <hi>Capernaum</hi> had the Law and the Goſpel too: And (faith the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.) <hi>If they that obeyed not Moſes law died, of how much ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rer judgment ſhall they be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of, that diſobey the Goſpel of Chriſt, the Law of faith?</hi> Thus God will proceed.</p>
               <p>And therefore, when ye would exerciſe repentance, follow Gods order, mourn more for impenitency,
<note place="margin">A direction in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> and infidelity, then for other things. Be more humbled for ſinnes againſt the firſt Table; for prophanneſſe, for Atheiſme, and neglect of God, then for ſinnes againſt the ſecond, though theſe muſt be lamented; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of too. Againe, be more in lamenting the inward ſinful diſpoſition of thy heart, then thy outward ſinful actions: and forget not the original root of all, which we brought with us into the world. I ſay, mark Gods method, and his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: that which he takes moſt notice of at the day of judgment, lay that to thy thoughts, and take greateſt notice of it now.</p>
               <p>It is a grievous thing for a man to be borne in ſinne, but to adde actual ſinnes to that, it is more grievous. For a man to ſinne in thought, and in heart is grievous, but to adde actual ſinnes to thoſe, it is more grievous. It is a grievous thing for a man to ſin againſt righteouſneſſe, to deale unjuſtly with men, but to deale un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly with God in point of his worſhip, is more grievous. It is a grievous ſinne for a man to diſobey the law of God, but to diſobey the law of faith, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay repentance, to deferre turning unto God, is far more grievous. Thus we ſhould mark Gods order,
<note place="margin">3. Becauſe he will proceed by books. Dan. 10. Rev. 20.</note> that he will obſerve, when he bringeth us to a reckoning.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is called a reckoning, becauſe God will proceed with men at that day (as Maſters with their ſervants) by writings, by books. In the tenth of <hi>Daniel, the booke was opened,</hi> and in the 20. <hi>Revel.</hi> there is mention made of <hi>bookes that ſhould be opened.</hi> God will proceed with all his <hi>Stewards,</hi> upon books that ſhall be opened. The bookes are either the book of the law, that ſhewes what wee ſhould have done:
<note place="margin">John 12.48.</note> 
                  <hi>The words that I ſpeak</hi> (faith Chirſt) <hi>the ſame ſhall judge you at the laſt day.</hi> And there <hi>is one that judgeth you, even Moſes that is read daily.</hi> And then ſecondly, there is the book of conſcience, that ſhewes what wee have done here: God will put the memories of men to the taske, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did <hi>Dives, Son remember that thou in thy life-time hadeſt thy pleaſure.</hi> So remember that thou in thy life time haddeſt riches, but how didſt thou imploy them? remember that thou hadeſt Authority, and office, and place in the Church of the Common-wealth, but what ſervice dideſt thou doe to God? remember that thou haddeſt wiſedome, and learning, and knowledg, but what good had the Church or Common-wealth by it? God I ſay, will put every mans memory to the task, what opportunities are loſt careleſly; nay, what opportunities he avoyded wilfully, when he might have done God better ſervice, yet leſt he ſhould be diſadvantaged in his by-reſpects in the world he bauked them: remember this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſins of Judah</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>are written with a pen of Iron, and with the point of a Diamond, they are graven upon the table of their hearts.</hi> God hath the
<note place="margin">Jer. 17.1.</note> ſins of men graven on the table of their hearts. Little doſt thou that art an old man, think of a thouſand things, that God will bring againſt thee, that were done in thy youth. <hi>Job</hi> little thought till the day of his affliction, when <hi>God made him poſſeſſe the ſins of his youth,</hi> that there was ſuch aboundance of guilt againſt him as there was. God will remember that, that thou haſt forgot.</p>
               <p>God will proceed by bookes, and this will clear Gods juſtice in his proceedings, and make every thing appeare righteous in the ſight of men and Angels, becauſe every mans conſcience ſhall teſtifie againſt himſelfe, and therefore the mouth of all ungodly men ſhall be ſtopped at the day of the Lord, they ſhall have nothing to ſay for themſelves, why juſtice ſhould not proceed againſt them. Here (will god ſay (I find ſo much given to uſury; ſo much gotten by uſury; ſo much ſpent in vain; ſo much kept injuriouſly from the furtherance of Gods worſhip, and planting the Goſpel where it was wanting; ſo much kept from benefiting the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, in publick, in private; ſo much from helping the poor: here I find it, how comes it here? was it not written with thy own hand? was it not thy ſelfe <pb n="12" facs="tcp:47453:13"/>that made this impreſſion upon thy conſcience by thy owne guilt? What wilt thou ſay for thy ſelfe? hath any one accuſed thee wrongfully? hath any one wrote it by miſtake? No, all is done with thy own hand, and you cannot deny your own hand writing, when it is brought to your face. Hath any one had the keeping of this book of thy conſcience? haſt thou not alwayes had it in thy owne Poſſeſſion? what canſt thou alledge for thy ſelfe?.</p>
               <p>I know (beloved) and it is true, that there are many other waies whereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men ſhall be accuſed at the laſt day: God himſelfe ſhall accuſe thee, and <hi>be a ſwift witneſs againſt thee,</hi> the Saints ſhall accuſe thee, wicked men ſhall accuſe thee, the Divels ſhall accuſe thee: but the main proceeding, and that that ſhall cleare Gods juſtice, and ſtop the mouthes of all ungodly men, is this, that the accuſation is by their owne hand-writing, their owne book ſhall accuſe them, that they have waſted their Lords goods and miſ-ſpent them.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt thing wherein this proceeding at the laſt day,
<note place="margin">4. Becauſe God will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act of every one according to what he hath been truſted with.</note> ſhall be like a reckoning is this: That there ſhall an account be made in meaſure, and proportion to the truſt committed to men. The Maſter when he reckoneth with his ſervant, he calleth him to account, not for ſome leſſer ſums, or for ſome one or two things, but for all that he hath intruſted him with, and if one ſervant have more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his account ſhall be greater then anothers, according to the greatneſſe of that that is committed to him, ſo ſhall the largneſſe of his reckoning be; <hi>to whom much is given,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 12.48.</note> 
                  <hi>of them much is expected,</hi> and to whom little, little is expected; but of every one ſomething is expected, becauſe every one is a <hi>Steward.</hi> The reckoning, I ſay, it ſhall be according to the difference of gifts and endowments, wherewith we are intruſted. When the Maſter in the Goſpel, called his ſervants to an account for the Talents, we ſee he that had ten Talents, made account for ten, and he that had five, for five, and he that had one, was called to an account but for one, every one for ſo much as he had received. He that hath received bodily abilities of health, and ſtrength ſhall account for that: He that hath had wealth and an eſtate in the world, ſhall make an account further for that. He that hath had all theſe, and authority and place, wherein he had power to doe right, and to glorifie God amongſt men, he muſt make an account for ſo much the more.</p>
               <p>Alas beloved, if men conſider, that the more wealth, they heap up, and the more places of authority, and preferments, they have in the world, their accounts ſhall be greater at the day of the Lord, certalnly it would make them more ſober, and walke more humbly, and watchfully, it would make them ſo much the more indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, to improve their talents, to the beſt advantage of their Lord that intruſted them with them.</p>
               <p>So much for the opeining of the point. I will conclude briefly with a few uſes of it.</p>
               <p>Ye ſee (Beloved) not onely that all are Gods <hi>Stewards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> but that all Gods <hi>Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> ſhall be brought to a reckoning, brought to it in this life, and in a nother. Ye ſee why it is called a reckoning, why God will proceed with men in this manner.</p>
               <p>The firſt Uſe then ſhall be for confutation of thoſe Atheiſts, that put farr from them the feare of the day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible that there ſhould be a generation of the world,
<note place="margin">Atheiſts in the Church.</note> that ſhould doubt of the Judgment to come? Nay, ſhall we go further and come neerer, not only in the world but in the Church, that there ſhould be ſuch as doubt of the time and day? By that that is done daily, it appears that there be many at this day in the Church, that doubt of a Judgment day.</p>
               <p>Firſt, do but try mens courſes. What ſins do they moſt fear, and moſt avoid? by that ye ſhall know what Judgment they fear and what they fear not. They fear only ſuch ſins as in the courſe of juſtice, men and their laws take hold of: ſuch as are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a breach of the ſecond Table. Men will not be injurious to men, leſt men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in mans juſtice againſt them. But how cometh it to paſſe that there is ſo little regard of God? of reverence of his name? of ſetting up his worſhip in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in their hearts? Certainly you doe not think that God will be as exact in his judgment, in matters that concerne his owne honour immediately, as any man <pb n="13" facs="tcp:47453:13"/>will be in caſes that are brought before him. Againe, do not men feare thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions which expoſe them to the cenſure of men on earth, and unto puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here? But in the meane time they feare not evill affections, and the motions of ſin in their owne hearts. A man would not be took with open theſe, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe he uſeth fraud, when men cannot diſcerne it. A man would not be tooke with murther, yet nevertheleſſe he is full of malice and envie, and repining, Why is this, but becauſe men acknowledg not a judgment to come? They feare not the judgment of God, wherein he will bring the breaches of the firſt Table to an account, as well as thoſe of the ſecond, and the ſecret thoughts, and ſinnes of the heart, to a reckoning, as well as outward actions.</p>
               <p>Such mockers there were in the time of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> againſt whom he ſpeakes in his ſecond Egiſtle, and third chapter. We will a little obſerve the method of the Apoſtle, that we may ſee how he diſcovereth them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

But ſome will ſay, by what inſtrument will he deſtroy the world? <hi>By ſire.</hi> How can that be, for that is one of the main parts, the main matter whereof things were made, and ſhall that be the deſtruction of that whereof it is made? Yes (ſaith the Apoſtle,) All things were made by water too, and yet they were deſtroyed by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and why not then by fire? But <hi>God deſerreth the promiſe of his coming?</hi> What of that? He putteth it not quite off, though he deferre, yet <hi>it is not long with God,</hi> for there is no time long to him that is eternal. and in that he deſerreth, it is that ſome men may be brought to ſalvation, and others made inexcuſable. Thus the Apoſtle takes off all objections of the Atheiſts of the world, and ſheweth that there ſhall be a day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>Secondly,

If there ſhall be ſuch a Judgment to come, if God will have ſuch a time of rekconing with all his <hi>Stewards</hi> in the world, Then it teacheth us firſt, not to buſie our ſelves in judging one another, why? becauſe there ſhall a time come of Gods Judgment.
<note place="margin">2. Not to judge others. Rom. 14.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Who art thou</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that judgeſt thy brother? we ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment ſeate of Chriſt.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; What a bold part? what a preſumptuous part is this, that thou ſhouldeſt judg thy brother? Doſt thou not know that there is one that ſhall judge him and thee? is it fit that he that is a priſoner at the Barre ſhould come and leap up into the place of the Judg, and ſit in his ſeat? Ye are all fellow priſoners toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ye muſt all ſtand before the Judgment fear of Chriſt. So in another place the ſame Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.5.</note> when he would take men off from judging, ſaith he, <hi>Judg no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before the time: Why? for the Lord will come, who both will bring to light, the hidden things of darkneſſe, and will make manifeſt the counſels of the hearts, and then ſhall every man have praiſe of God.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; Thou art not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judg aright, it may be that man that thou diſpraiſeſt, at that day may find praiſe with God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. To judge our ſelves here.</note> Turn the Judgment on thy own heart, be more in Judging of thy ſelf, that thou mayeſt not be Judged of the Lord. Will God call thee to a reckoning? then begin to call thy ſelf to a reckoning firſt.</p>
               <p>How ſhall that be done?</p>
               <p>There is a double reckoning that every man muſt undergoe,
<note place="margin">A two ſold reckoning to be made here.</note> that will avoid this reckoning with God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he muſt reckon with his own heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly with others.</p>
               <p>Firſt with his own heart.
<note place="margin">1. Reckon with out ſelves</note> Every man muſt take all the advantages, opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that God hath given, to reckon with himſelfe. Doth God awaken thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by the preaching of his word: Deſcend into thy own heart? It is that that <pb n="14" facs="tcp:47453:14"/>the Lord looks for,
<note place="margin">Jer. 8.6.</note> that a man ſhould ſay, <hi>What have I done?</hi> Doth God ſmite thee with ſome afflictions, if with loſſes? reckon with thy ſelf how thou haſt gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thy wealth: If with diſgraces, reckon with thy ſelfe about thy pride, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and vanitie of thy heart. If God ſmite thy body with ſickneſſe: reckon with thy ſelf about the imployment of thy health, and the well uſage of the times and ſeaſons of grace. Every evening call thy ſelf to an account; What have I done this day? where have I been? In what company? how have I carried my ſelf there? what good have Idone? what good have I received? In the matters of thy calling, reckon with thy ſelf, with what heart thou haſt followed it, with what care to conforme thy ſelfe to Gods word, the rule of righteouſneſſe. If thou haſt been in pleaſures, whether they were lawful, and if they were, whether they were lawfully uſed. Thus muſt every man reckon with his own heart; as the Church in <hi>Lament.</hi>

<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Commune with your own hearts upon your beds;</hi> that is, be ſure to take time from your ſleep, rather then to neglect this buſineſſe of reckoning with your own hearts.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Reckon with others.</note> Reckon with others too. Let that man that is in authority, a Magiſtrate, ſo carry himſelf in his imployments, that he may reckon with the people, and give an account to them if need be, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, <hi>Whoſe oxe have I taken? or whoſe aſſe have I taken?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.3.</note> 
                  <hi>or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppreſſed? or of whoſe hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a witneſſe that ye have not found any thing in my hand.</hi> And not only ſo, but that they may be able to witneſſe, that they have been great inſtruments of Gods glory, and of the good of others.</p>
               <p>Let Miniſters reckon with the people committed to their charge, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, when he took his leave of the Epheſians, and was to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem; I take you to record this day</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I am pure from the blood of all men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 20.26.</note> 
                  <hi>for I have not ſhunned to declare to you the whole counſel of God, and I have kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have ſhewed you, and tought you publikely, and from houſe to houſe.</hi> And becauſe I know that <hi>after my departure, there will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what</hi> remain to be done for <hi>Grievous wolves will enter in, not ſparing the flock;</hi> therefore I will be carefull that there be a ſucceſſion of faithfull Miniſters afther me, and therefore I give carge to the reſt that follow, that <hi>they take heed to themſelves and to the ſtook over which the holy Ghoſt hath made them overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let Maſters, reckon with their Familes, their ſervants and children, whether they have done their duty as faithful Maſters, not only in furthering the ſervice of God, but alſo in furthering of them by inſtruction, and example to all good.</p>
               <p>Let thoſe that are in a way of traffique, learn to reckon with thoſe that they deal withal. If thou haſt wronged any by unjuſt gain, thou muſt reckon with him by reſtitution: there is nothing that thou haſt gotten unjuſtly, for which thou doſt not reckon now,
<note place="margin">Iames. 5.3.</note> but (as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith) at that day <hi>ſhall eat they fleſh as it were fire.</hi> Therefore <hi>Zacheus, when ſalvation was brought to his houſe,</hi> If I <hi>have done uujuſtly, and wronged any, I reſtore it.</hi> Doubtleſs there are many men that cloath themſelves in Sattin and Velvet, and abound in all variety and bravery, that would now be houſeleſs, and moneyleſs, and apparelleſs, it may be, if they ſhould make reſtitution of their unjuſt gain. Well, do it, as ye love your own ſouls: you ſhall reckon as you are Gods <hi>Stewards</hi> with him, how you have come by every penny that you have in the world, and therefore goe about it now.</p>
               <p>Reckon with others alſo for works of mercy, what thou haſt been wanting in to thy brethren: thou haſt lived thus long in a plentifull eſtate, what haſt thou done wich thy eſtate? <hi>Joſephus</hi> reckons up three ſeveral tenths that were expected and exacted of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Wouldeſt thou be leſs liberal now in the time of the Goſpel, <pb n="15" facs="tcp:47453:14"/>then they were under the law? Is God leſſe merciful? or hath he leſs intereſt in thy eſtate? Thou haſt ſo many thouſands, What haſt thou done out of this to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the poor? or to ſet up thoſe in a courſe of traffique, and trade, that want a ſtock. Beloved you cannot (if you look about you) want objects of mercy, and means to further your reckoning at the day of the Lord. And if you would be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>ſtewards</hi> to God, ſay thus: I have been thus much behind-hand in paying the due I owe to the poor, to the Church, &amp;c. I will pay it while I live, and if that be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, when I die I will pay it. But I haſten. That is the ſecond thing, Let every man reckon thus with his own heart.</p>
               <p>The third thing is,
<note place="margin">3. To Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe daily repentance, Acts 17.31.</note> the daily exerciſe of repentance upon the ſight of your former evils: <hi>God now</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>calleth all men every where to repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſs.</hi> Let this then ſtir us up to repentance. God expects that men ſhould judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves now.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4. To get an intereſt in Chriſt. Rom 8.1. Exod. 25.21.</note> If you would ſtand at that great day of Judgement, when there ſhall be ſuch an exact reckoning. Intereſt now your ſelves in Chriſt. There is no way to eſcape the Judgement to come, but by making peace with the Judge now. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> This was prefigured in the <hi>Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate,</hi> that was to be compaſſed about with the <hi>wings of the Cherubins,</hi> all covering the <hi>two tables of the Teſtament,</hi> one Cherubin to look toward another: ſhewing us thus much, that there is no covering of our tranſgreſſions committed againſt the commandements of God, the tables of the Teſtimony, but by the great Mercy-ſeat the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, upon whome the Fathers of the times before Chriſt, and Beleevers ſince look, expecting the covering of the guilt of their ſins from the wrath of God by no other means, but by this propitiator or <hi>Mercy-ſeat,</hi> that covereth the Arke of the Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">5. To lead a holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</note> it ſerveth alſo for inſtruction in another point, that is, To teach us to lead a holy converſation. This uſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> made of the Doctrin of the day of Judgement, <hi>Seeing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we locke for theſe things, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlideſſe?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.11,</note> Alas (beloved) little do you know whether this be the laſt Sermon that many of you may heare, whether this be the laſt day wherein God will ever call upon you to repent, and amend your lives. There ſhall be a fearful diſſolution, and deſtruction of all things that you ſee. There ſhall be a naked appearance made before the Judge at that day of reckoning: let every man therefore ſay within himſelf, How ſhall I ſtand at that time, at that Judgement?
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.9.</note> All our care ſhould be that of the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls, Whether we be abſent from the body, or preſent in the body, we labour that we may be accepted of the Lord:</hi> Whether we live a day longer, or die this day before the morrow, that we may be found acceptable before the Lord. And for this cauſe (ſaith he in another place) <hi>becauſe there ſhall be a reſurrection from the dead, both of the juſt and unjuſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 26.15: 16.</note> 
                  <hi>I exerciſe my ſelf to have alwayes a conſcience void of offence toward God, and toward men.</hi> Look to it in your places, and in your hearts, that you may have a good conſcience, void of offence toward God and men: for the time ſhall come, that nothing in the world ſhall ſtand you in ſtead, but a good conſcience: and if then when the books are opened, it be found that your reckonings are even, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts clear, between you and your Maſter, by obedience and repentance, by works and by faith, <hi>happy ſhall that ſervant be whome his Maſter at that day ſhall find ſo doing.</hi>

Let them quietly, and cheerfully, ſuffer that portion of miſerie, and affliction that the Lord dealeth out unto them. Let them not grudge at the proſperity of ungodly men, or at the variety of changes, that themſelves are expoſed unto; becauſe there is a day of reckoning, and account, when all things ſhall be made even. The Apoſtle Saint <hi>James</hi> exhorteth Chriſtians <hi>to patience</hi> upon this very ground,
<note place="margin">James 5.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe the day of the Lord draweth nigh.</hi> If therefore you ſee wicked men proſper, <hi>and bring their enterpriſes to paſſe,</hi> be not troubled at the matter. A man doth not much envy an enemy that is now in priſon, though he have ſome good chear there, though he have ſome friends, <pb n="16" facs="tcp:47453:15"/>that come and ſee him there, becauſe he knows he is but a Priſoner, and he ſhall be brought out at the Aſſizes, and then he ſhall be righted. The world is the common Jayle, whereinto <hi>Adam</hi> was caſt after he had ſinned, and we are all priſoners in this priſon-houſe: the enemies of Gods glory, and of his Church and people, they cannot eſcape out of this priſon, here they are tied, Gods chains are upon them, and he will bring them to an <hi>account</hi> before his Judgement ſeate, and that before all men and Angels. With theſe things let us comfort and ſupport our ſelves.</p>

<note place="margin">Heb. 9.27.</note> it is that they may be brought into his preſence, and there receive the ſentence, either of abſolution or condemnation, as I ſhewed you before concerning the ſoul o man, in that intelectual manner receiving the ſentence. <hi>It is appointed to all men once to die, and after that the Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have now a ſpectacle of mortality before you: one of <hi>Gods ſtewards</hi> took away, and called by death to give up his account. Concerning whom, it cannot be expected that I ſhould ſay much, or any thing at all, ſpecially by thoſe that know both the condition of his living, and of his dying.</p>
                  <p>For his living. It was not in the Citie, but for the moſt part, it was from us in the Country.</p>
                  <p>For his dying. He was here but a day or two before he was taken hence. Hee came to the Citie in the extremity of his weakneſſe, and it took him with ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as the nature of that diſeaſe, the ſtone, is. There was much expreſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from him: but it pleaſed God to make a ſudden change more then we looked for, for (as I ſaid) his diſeaſe ſeized on him with ſuch violence, and extremity, that he had no ſpace for any thing but to pray us, to pray with him, and for him</p>
                  <p>That which we may learn from ſuch examples as theſe, is this; That we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be good <hi>Stewards</hi> in the time of our life. We know not what violent ſickneſſe may ſeize upon us, and how it may diſ-inable us, to expreſſe our ſelves to men, or to ſet our reckonings even with God. Be ſerious therefore in the point, while you have health and ſtrength. All of you are now called to a reckoning by the preaching of the Word and Goſpel, if this will not prevail, expect another calling by ſickneſſe, by terrours of conſcience, by death. You are not ſure but that the next calling may be by death, as it was with this our brother; let me put this therefore as a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to every one of you, that you behave your ſelves as dying daily; Remember thou art a <hi>Steward,</hi> and <hi>muſt give an account of thy Stewardſhip.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Chapter,
<note place="margin">The Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> the Wiſe Man had been ſhewing the vanity, and inſufficiency of all earthly things to make a man happy, and how much the World is miſtaken, in ſeeking happineſs in any thing here below. In this Chapter, and thoſe that follow, he cometh to direct men in the right way to find it, and ſheweth them where they ſhould ſeek it, and where they ſhould find it: Firſt he telleth them of a <hi>good name,</hi> in the firſt verſe. <hi>A good name is better than preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ointment.</hi> The ſecond means is, <hi>a good death; the day of death is better than the day of ones birth.</hi> The third is a right <hi>mourning; it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to go to the houſe of mourning, than to the houſe of feaſting.</hi> Afterward he proceedeth to other particulars. But this he bringeth in upon the former, to prevent an objection that ſome might make: for having ſaid that <hi>the day of death, is better then the day of ones birth;</hi> ſome might object: What goodneſſe can there <pb n="18" facs="tcp:47453:16"/>be in death? as for thoſe that are dead, they ceaſe to be, and they that are alive reap no benefit by it, but mourning, and there is little good, little happineſſe in this, to exerciſe a mans thoughts about mournful objects; Yes (ſaith he) it is <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to go to the houſe of mourning, then to the houſe of feaſting, for the living will lay it to his heart.</hi> And upon this he ſpendeth ſome time, becauſe naturally we are exceeding backward, to beleeve that it is good for a man to be mourning upon earth.</p>
               <p>Others make the dependance of the words thus; That <hi>Solomon</hi> having before ſhewed the vanity of riches, he doth in the ſix former verſes of this Chapter, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer even death it ſelfe, before wealth and abundance. And he ſheweth wherein it is better.</p>
               <p>Firſt in the Adjuncts. The Adjunct of <hi>death is mourning:</hi> the Adjunct of wealth and abundance is <hi>feaſting:</hi> yet <hi>mourning</hi> is better then <hi>feaſting.</hi> And becauſe it ſeemeth a Parradox to every natural man, he cometh to confirm and prove it.</p>
               <p>By the Effects. In the third verſe; <hi>Sorrow is better then laughter, for by the ſadneſſe of the countenance, the heart is made better.</hi> Sorrow can do that for us that wealth cannot, it <hi>makes the heart better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the different ſubjects in which they are. That ſame worldly <hi>mirth is in the heart of fooles.</hi> In the fourth verſe: <hi>the heart of fooles, is in the houſe of mirth:</hi> but this <hi>mourning</hi> it is in the <hi>heart of the wiſe: the heart of the wiſe is in the houſe of mourning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Efficient cauſe. One cauſe of <hi>mourning</hi> is the <hi>rebukes of the wiſe.</hi> In the fifth verſe; <hi>It is better to hear the rebukes of the wiſe, then for a man to hear the ſong of fools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then in the ſixth verſe by a <hi>Prolepſis,</hi> he prevents an objection that ſome might make. For whereas he had ſaid that <hi>mourning</hi> was better then joy, ſome might ſay. It ſeemeth otherwiſe, there is delight in <hi>joy,</hi> there is none in <hi>mourning.</hi> He telleth them that that delight, it is but a very ſhort delight, but <hi>as the cracking of thorns under a pot, it is but vanity. As the cracking of thorns under a pot, ſo is the laughter of a fool, this alſo is vanity.</hi>

               <p>We will not ſtand much about the matter. So many ſeverall men as handle this book, do ſeverally connect and joyn the words together, according to their own conceits and opinions of them.</p>
               <p>It is evident,
<note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note> that in this verſe that I have now read to you, the Wiſe man ſpeaks of ſuch a <hi>mourning,</hi> as is occaſioned by the <hi>death</hi> of freinds. And he ſaith of that <hi>mourning,</hi> that <hi>it is better then to be in the houſe of feaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he ſpeaks of ſuch a <hi>mourning,</hi> appears by that which followeth: firſt he ſaith, that that is <hi>the end of all men,</hi> he ſpeaks therefore of ſuch a <hi>mourning,</hi> as is upon the <hi>end</hi> of men, upon the departure of men out of this world: and ſecondly he ſaith, <hi>the living will lay it to his heart:</hi> he ſpeaks of ſuch an <hi>end</hi> of men, as is oppoſite to the <hi>life</hi> of men.</p>
               <p>In a word. <hi>By the houſe of mourning,</hi> he meaneth a houſe wherein ſome one is dead, which giveth occaſion to the parties that dwell there, of ſorrow and <hi>mourning</hi> for their departed friend. <hi>It is better to go to ſuch a houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>houſe of feaſting,</hi> he meaneth not only ſuch a houſe wherein there is feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but alſo all manner of abundance: as commonly men ſhew their wealth in feaſting.</p>
               <p>By <hi>the end of all men,</hi> he meaneth that which the Schools calls the <hi>end of termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now there is a twofold <hi>end of termination</hi> (as they ſpeak) either <hi>Poſitive,</hi> or <hi>Privative.</hi> A <hi>Poſitive</hi> end, as a point is the end of a line, and an inſtant is the end of time: becauſe the line reſolveth it ſelfe into a point at laſt, and all time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth it ſelf at laſt into an inſtant. A <hi>Privative</hi> end, and that is that that cauſeth a ceſſation of beeing, that is the end of action, wherein all the work, and invention, and enterprizes of a man ceaſe. Of ſuch an end here he ſpeaks, ſuch an end of a man as that he ceaſeth to be as he was upon earth, and ceaſeth to do as he did upon earth.</p>
               <p>By <hi>laying to heart,</hi> he meaneth more then a bare konwing, or a bare obſerving, <pb n="19" facs="tcp:47453:16"/>and taking notice of things. There is to be underſtood here, a ſerious pondering an often conſidering of it, as it is ſaid of <hi>Marie, She layed thoſe ſayings to heart;</hi> and ſo <hi>Iacob, he layed the ſayings of Joſeph to heart.</hi> It is ſuch a ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and pondering, and diſcuſſing of every thing, as they may bring it to ſome uſe, may draw ſome fruit, and benefit out of it to themſelves.</p>
               <p>So that the ſumme and ſubſtance of the words is thus much; <hi>It is a better thing for a man to be converſant about the thoughts of death, and to take hold of all occaſions that may bring the ſerious conſideration thereof into his heart, then to delight himſelfe in thoſe worldly pleaſures, and ſenſual delights, wherein for the moſt part men ſpend their lives.</hi> The reaſon is, <hi>becauſe their is ſome benefit that ariſeth thereby to the inward man, ſome advantage gained to the ſoule: whereas by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is none at all, there is much hinderance and hurt, but no furtherance and benefit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words then you ſee conſiſt of a Propoſition;
<note place="margin">The deviſion of the words.</note> And a proof or confirmation of that Propoſition.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition. <hi>It is better to go to the houſe of mourning, then to go to the houſe of feaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The confirmation or proofe of it, is double; firſt, becauſe <hi>this is the end of all men:</hi> ſecondly, becauſe <hi>the living will lay it to his heart.</hi> This latter part is that which I purpoſe moſt to inſiſt upon.</p>
               <p>In the former. He calleth the houſe wherein any one dies, <hi>the houſe of mourning. It is better to go to the houſe of mourning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where you ſee;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 1. The death of others, is a juſt occaſion of Mourning.</note> That the Death of men, with whom we live, is a juſt occaſion of mourning to ſome.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghoſt would not have deſcribed the houſe wherin a man dies in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if their were not ſome equity, and juſtice in mourning, upon ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For he ſpeaks not here (as I conceive) only with reference, and reſpect to the common cuſtome of natural and worldly men; but with reſpect to the natural diſpoſition, and affection, that is in the heart of man, and the equity of the thing. There ſhould be mourning, and there is in it a juſt occaſion, when men are taken away by death.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Sarah</hi> died,
<note place="margin">Gen. 23.2.</note> the text ſaith that <hi>Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, &amp; to weep for her.</hi> And <hi>Eſau,</hi> when he ſpeaks of the death of his father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he calleth the time of his death,
<note place="margin">Gen. 27.41.</note> the <hi>time of mourning, the dayes of mourning for my father are at hand.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 50.10 2. Sam. 25.1.</note> So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> when his father was dead, it is ſaid that <hi>he mourned for his father ſeven dayes.</hi> When <hi>Samuel</hi> was dead, all the Iſraelites <hi>were gathered together and lamented him.</hi> When <hi>Ioſiah</hi> was dead, there was ſuch a great lamentation for him,
<note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> that it became a pattern of exceſſive mourning; <hi>In that day there ſhall be a great mourning in Ieruſalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt, when he looked upon <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he <hi>wept,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was dead.
<note place="margin">John. 11.</note> And thoſe Epheſians, this was it that broke their hearts, they <hi>ſorrowed moſt of all for the words which S. Paul ſpake,
<note place="margin">Act. 20.38.</note> that they ſhould ſee his face no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I need not ſtand upon the proof of the point.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> There is great reaſon for it, firſt if we reſpect men in their uſefulneſſe to others. There is no man but is of ſome uſe: and ſo farre as a man is uſeful to another, there is juſt ground of mourning, for the loſſe of ſuch a one. Therefore <hi>David,</hi> he mourned for the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> though he was a wicked man, becauſe he was uſeful in his time by way of goverment. And as there is more uſefulneſſe, ſo there is more cauſe of mourning, as we ſee in the death of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Reaſ. 2.</note> becauſe when thoſe that are uſeful, are taken away, a man ſeeth ſome effects partly of his own guilt, and partly of Gods diſpleaſure. Of his own guilt If thoſe die that are evil, that he did not do them that good that he might, while they lived, he did not converſe ſo profitably, as he might have done, to further their ſpiritual good. If they be good and gracious, that he received not benefit by them, that he did not mannage the opportunities, as he might have done, to have made that uſe of their ſociety and conference, of their prayers, and ſpiritual helps, <pb n="20" facs="tcp:47453:17"/>of all thoſe gifts and endowments that they had. And as in the defect, ſo likewiſe in the exceſſe there is guilt. When a man idoliſeth the creature too much, and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth too much to the arm of fleſh: when he ſetteth too great a price upon men, he may apprehend the diſpleaſure of God, taking away his brother, that was (as it were) a curtain that ſtood between God and him, taking away thoſe that hid God from his eyes.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe occaſions and grounds the ſervants of God have reflected upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeeing the death of others, that are near, and dear unto them, and have drawn from thence, matter and cauſe of mourning.</p>
               <p>Nay,
<note place="margin">Ier. 5.3.</note> it is a thing that the Lord looks for: <hi>Thou haſt ſmitten them, and they have not grieved.</hi> When God takes away any that are uſefull to us, there is a ſmiting, and a correction in it, even to thoſe that live, to thoſe that were intimate and inward with him, and God expects that men ſhould <hi>mourne,</hi> and grieve for it.</p>
               <p>I briefly note this (for I intend not to ſtand upon it) againſt that Stoicall Apethy,
<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> that ſtupidity, I cannot ſay whether it have ſeized on the ſpirits of men, or whether men affect it in themſelves: but they account this a matter of praiſe, a vertue praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, to ſee nothing doleful, nothing worthy of mourning in the death of any one. We ſee it is quite contrary to the very courſe of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But it will be objected.
<note place="margin">Object.</note> We are bid to <hi>mortifie our earthly affections;</hi> and if we muſt mortifie our affections, we muſt mortifie all our affections, that of ſorrow, as well as anger, and the like.</p>
               <p>I anſwer briefly.
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> The Scripture indeed biddeth us <hi>mortifie our affections,</hi> but it doth not bid us take away our affections : it biddeth us only mortifie, and purge out the corruption of our affections.
<note place="margin">A twofold diſtempe In mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1.2.</note> Now there is a twofold corruption, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper in the affections of men. The firſt is, when they are miſplaced, and ſetupon wrong objects: ſo we mourn for that we ſhould rejoyce in, or we rejoyce in that we ſhould mourn for. Secondly, when they are either exceſſive or defective: either we over-do, or we do not, either not at all, or not in that proportion, and meaſure that we ſhould. Thus, when we over-grieve for worldly croſſes, and too little for ſin; too much for the loſſe of earthly friends and too little for the loſſe of Gods favour, and ſpiritual wants: this is a diſtemper of the affections in the defect, the heart grows earthly, and fixed upon the creature, and is drawn away, and eſtranged from God. Then there is the exceſſe: that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of, when he exhorts them,
<note place="margin">1 Theſe. 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>not to mourn as men without hope:</hi> whether he ſpake there of the Gentiles, as ſome think; that cut their heads, and made themſelves bald, in the day of their mourning, an affected kind of outward ſhew they had to mourn, which the Lord forbad the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to do:
<note place="margin">Deut. 14.</note> or whether (as indeed it is) becauſe they did not reſtrain inwardly, and bridle the exorbitant exceſſe of their affection, we ſhould not mourn as the Gentiles, but as men of hope: mourn as men that can ſee the changes that God makes in the earth, and in your Families, and can ſee how neer God cometh to you, and what uſe God would have you make of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular tryal and affliction: mourn ſo far as you ſee your own guilt, in not making uſe of the opportunities you have had in enjoying your friends, and ſo far as you ſee any evidence of diſpleaſure from God: ſo far we ſhould mourn, but not as men without hope.</p>
               <p>But I briefly paſſe this, intending not to inſiſt upon it, only by occaſion, becauſe <hi>Solomom</hi> makes the place where any die, the <hi>houſe of morning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come now to the proof of the point, why going to the <hi>houſe of morning,</hi> taking theſe occaſions to affect our hearts, is better <hi>then to go to the houſe of feaſting,</hi> then to take occaſions of delighting our ſelves in outward things. What's the reaſon? It is double.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>This is the end of all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is <hi>the end of all men? The houſe of mourning.</hi> That which he meaneth by the <hi>houſe of mourning</hi> here, is that which he calleth <hi>the end of all men,</hi> that which putteth an end to all men, and to their actions upon earth, and that is Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47453:17"/>
So that the main point, that in this place the wiſe man intendeth, is but thus much, I will deliver it in the very words of the Text, we need not varie from them at all.<lb/>
                  <hi>Death is the end of all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 2.</note>
               <p>Death is that which every man muſt expect,
<note place="margin">Death the end of all men.</note> to be the end of his life, and of his actions. It is the common, the laſt condition of all men upon earth.</p>
               <p>I will give you but two places of Scripture, that include all men in Death. One in <hi>Job</hi> the third,
<note place="margin">Iob 3.14.</note> from the fourteenth verſe, to the 20. Verſe of that Chapter, <hi>Job</hi> ſheweth there how <hi>Death is the End of all men</hi> he beginneth with the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Counſellers of the Earth,</hi> with <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>great Warriors,</hi> and deſcendeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to <hi>priſoners and mean perſons, to labourers, to ſervants, to ſmall and great, all</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lie down in the duſt, and go to the place of ſilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other place is in <hi>Zachar.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Your fathers where are they?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Prophets, do they live for ever?</hi> That is, look to all your fore-fathers, that have been in all times before you, whether they be thoſe Fathers that you glory in, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the reſt, or thoſe Fathers that diſobeyed the word of Propheſie (which indeed is the principall thing here intended) all theſe Ancient perſons they are dead; or as <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſpeaks, of thoſe that were diſobedient in the dayes of <hi>Noah, they are in priſon,</hi> they are in the grave : yea, and the Prophets too, that preached to you, they are dead: the generations before you, both of Prophets and people, are all dead.</p>
               <p>You ſee then, that <hi>Death is the common condition of all men.</hi> Kings and Subjects, Prophets and people, this is the laſt thing that ſhall be ſaid of them all, they are dead.</p>
               <p>And it muſt be ſo;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. In regard of Gods decree.</note> Firſt in regard of Gods decree. It is that that God hath appointed, and determined, concerning all men, that they muſt die: there is a ſtatute for it in heaven, that can never be reverſt. <hi>It is appointed to all men once to die, Heb.</hi> 9.17.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. In regard of the matter whereof men are made. Iob 13 12.</note> in regard of that matter whereof all men are made, of earth: <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return, Your remembrances</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>are like unto aſhes, &amp; your bodies, to bodyes of clay.</hi> How eaſie is it for the wind to blow away aſhes? for a potter to break in pieces a veſſel of clay? ſo eaſie it is to put an end to the memories and bodies of men, they are but aſhes and clay.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. In regard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man in him, hath the cauſe of death.</note> in regard that every man hath in him, that that is the cauſe of Death: ſin. It is that that is as poiſon in the ſpirits, and as rottenneſſe in the bones. Sin brought in Death, and Death ſeizes upon all men; it conſumeth all men from the very beginning by degrees. Shew me a man without ſin: without it either in the committing of it, or without it in the guilt of it, you may then ſhew a man that ſhall not die: while all men are under ſin, they are under Death. Even our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, though he did not ſin actually, yet becauſe he ſtood guiltie of our ſins, Death ſeized upon him.</p>
               <p>So then. Look to Gods decree, that is, All men ſhall die. Look to the matter whereof every man is made; that is, a decaying dying ſubſtance. And look to the cauſe of death in all men, that is ſin; If any man can either eſcape Gods decree, or bring a man that is not made of ſuch a mouldring matter, or produce, and ſhew a man that hath no ſin in him: then you may ſhew a man that ſhall not die: but till then this concluſion remaineth, that the wiſe man ſetteth down, <hi>this is the end of all men, that they ſhall die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it will be objected;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Heb 11.5.</note> We find ſome men that did not die. It is ſaid of <hi>Enoch, that he was tranſlated,</hi> that <hi>he ſhould not ſee death,</hi> Heb, 11.5. And of <hi>Elijah,
<note place="margin">2 King. 2.11.</note> that he went up by a whirle-wind into heaven in a chariot of fire, 2 Kings</hi> 2.11. Theſe men did not die.</p>
               <p>To this,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> I anſwer briefly. Particular and extraordinary examples, do not fruſtrate general rules: God may ſometimes diſpence with ſome particular men, and yet the rule remain firm; I ſay it may be ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47453:18"/>
But ſecondly we anſwer. They had that that was in ſtead of Death to them, ſome change, though they did not die after the manner of other men. So at the end of the world, it is ſaid, <hi>that thoſe that are alive ſhall be caught up and changed, in the twinckling of an eye?</hi> there ſhall be a ſudden, and almoſt undiſcernable, unperceivable change, which ſhall be to them inſtead of death.</p>
               <p>But it will be objected further.
<note place="margin">Object.</note> There is a promiſe made in <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. <hi>That thoſe that believe ſhall never die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer with that common diſtinction;
<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> There is a twofold death, which the Scripture calleth, the <hi>firſt and the ſecond death:</hi> The <hi>firſt death,</hi> is the death of the body, that ariſeth from a diſ-junction, and ſeparation of the body from the ſoule; And there ie a <hi>ſecond death,</hi> that ariſeth from the diſ-junction, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſoule from God. The <hi>firſt death,</hi> is no death properly, the <hi>ſecond death</hi> is that which is truly Death: and ſo they ſhall not die. A man may have a body ſeparated from the ſoule, and yet not his ſoul ſeparated from God, nor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt? neither life nor death, nor principalities nor powers, &amp;c.</hi> Death you ſee ſhall not be able to ſeparate us from God: it cannot ſeparate the ſoule: Nay, it doth not ſeparate the body from Chriſt: the body remaineth a member of Chriſt, as well while it is ſtill in the grave, as before: <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living,</hi> ſaith Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Matt. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. And therefore he proveth, that even <hi>Abraham</hi> was not dead in that ſenſe, that they then took it, but he remaineth yet alive, in as much as God was his God. <hi>Abraham</hi> (whole <hi>Abraham</hi>) was Gods by vertue of Covenant, ſo are all his poſterity, the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith, in a ſpiritual ſenſe they remain with Chriſt, and they are united to him, as members to the head, even when their bodies are in the grave. So that (I ſay) they die not in that ſenſe, ſo as to have their ſoule ſeparated from God; though they die in the firſt ſenſe, that is, to have their bodies ſeparated from the ſoule. But our Saviour in that place of <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>ſecond;</hi> of that death, which is an everlaſting ſeparation of the ſoul from God. As we ſay of wicked men, that while they are alive, they are dead; ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>widdow that lived in pleaſures, while ſhe lived ſhe was dead?</hi> and the Church of Sardis, <hi>had a name to live, but ſhe was dead.</hi> This is true death indeed, when that the ſoul of a man is ſeparated, and diſ-joyned from God, and from Chriſt: And it is the ſtate of every man by nature, of every man under ſin, though they walk up and down, and do the actions of the living, yet they are but dead men. And as truly, as they are ſaid to be dead while they live, ſo truly it may be ſaid of the children of God, that while they are dead, they live as it ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſo it may be ſaid of all Gods ſervants, they die not properly, but remain ſtill in union with God, and with Chriſt: with God through Chriſt, they are Chriſts, and therefore Gods in him, and therefore they die not. Look what the ſoule is to the body, that is God to the ſoul: the ſoul is the life of the body, and God is the life of the ſoul; they are ſtill living men, that have God; the ſoul is alive, even when the body lieth down in the grave. This ſhall ſerve for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of that, they are not dead, but alive: they do die in the firſt ſenſe, and in the common acceptation, in reſpect of the ſeparation of the body from the ſoul; but they do not die in the ſecond ſenſe, in reſpect of the ſeparation of the ſoul from God; they do not die eternally, they do not die properly.</p>
               <p>Now briefly to make ſome uſe of this, and to haſten to that I moſt intend to ſtand upon.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo then,
<note place="margin">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it for our ſelves.</note> that <hi>Death is the end of all men.</hi> Let us make account of it for our ſelves. This ſeemeth but a plain point, and ſo indeed it is: but I know there is nothing more uſeful, and I know there is nothing leſſe regarded, and leſſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of ſeriouſly then this, that we muſt die. It is true, we all acknowledge it in the general, and every man, the very worſt, the moſt ignorant, and moſt prophane in the world will yeeld to this in the general, that all men muſt die, and let a man come and tell them, that they themſelves muſt die, they will grant it too, but this is that that undoes us all, we reſt in generals, and do not ſeriouſly inſiſt upon a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious application of it, to a mans own particular caſe, and bring it home to a mans <pb n="23" facs="tcp:47453:18"/>ſelf; to conclude thus I muſt die, I may die ſoon, this may be the laſt day of my life upon earth, this may be the laſt time I may breath, this may be the laſt word that I ſhall ſpeak, the laſt action that I ſhall do; I know I muſt die, and it may be I may die now. This is that we ſhould principally intend, and labour moſt after, that when we read the ſtories of the Scripture, and ſee that Death is the end of all men, that all muſt die, and their houſes muſt be <hi>houſes of mourning,</hi> to conclude the ſame for our ſelves. All thoſe worthies ſpoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. it is ſaid, <hi>they all died in faith;</hi> I read ſuch a man was a King, but he died; ſuch a man was a Prophet, but he died; ſuch a man was Noble, but he died; ſuch a one died in his youth, ſuch a one in his ſtrength, theſe died, and I muſt die; the ſame thing muſt be ſaid of me, that is ſaid of them. I ſay, let us not only ſay it, but reſolve, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude upon it; conclude for our ſelves, that the ſame thing muſt be ſaid of us, that is ſaid of all men;
<note place="margin">The benefit of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of death to a mans ſelfe.</note> All men muſt die, we muſt die.</p>
               <p>The benefit that floweth from it will be this;</p>
               <p>Firſt, when a man bringeth it to his own particular caſe, it will make ſin more odious to him. What is it that brought Death into the world? what bringeth death upon us? Sin. <hi>By one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men,
<note place="margin">1. Sin will be made more odious. Rom. 5.11.</note> for that all have finned.</hi> This I ſay is it, that will make ſin odious to a man, it will make a man look upon ſin as a deadly evil. A man will avoid an infections diſeaſe, that is mortall and deadly, and peſtilential, and the like; Why? becauſe it is deadly, it is as much as his life is worth. The ſame is ſin, it is that that brought death upon all man-kind, and will bring it upon thee. When doth the creature forfeit his beeing to the Creator, but when he doth not uſe it in the ſervice, and for the glory of the Creator. God hath given the creature a beeing for himſelf, I have forfeited my beeing, when I glorifie not God with it; that man forfeiteth his wit, his memory, his ſtrength, his time, his life, and all that he is or hath, when he doth not imploy them in Gods ſervice, to Gods glory. Now ſin is that that makes us deny the ſervice and glory we owe to God; ſin is that that makes a forfeiture of our lives, and all unto him. Here is the firſt thing, God hath given the creature a beeing for himſelf, he preſerveth the creature in beeing for himſelfe, when the creature therefore ſinneth it forfeiteth its life and beeing to the Creator. This makes ſin odious.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. The truth and juſtice of God will bee the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</note> this is it, that declareth the wonderful juſtice, and truth of God. He ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning, aſſoon as ever he had fallen, <hi>he ſhould die:</hi> and we find it true on him, and all his poſterity: for <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood and repreſented the perſon of all men before God, that one man was all men: in him all men were under the ſentence of death. And we ſee it is true to this day. We find God true in this, let this make us beleeve his word in every thing elſe. He hath been as good as his word, he hath declared his juſtice, and his truth in the death of all man-kind upon the ſin of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> he will declare it in every thing elſe, in every promiſe, in every threatning, in every paſſage of his word: let us give him the glory of his truth, as we find it in this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,

                     </gap> prepared for Job 14.14.5</note> it is advantagious very much for our ſelves, as a means to prepare us for death the better. When a man ſeriouſly concludeth, <hi>Death is the end of all men;</hi> then if I reckon and account my ſelf amongſt men, it will be my end too, and it may be my end now. And we ſhall ſee what uſe <hi>Job</hi> makes of this: <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time, I will wait till my change ſhall come.</hi> I make account a great change ſhall come, ſuch as hath been upon all my fathers before me, ſo it will come upon me, I will make account of it, and therefore <hi>I will wait all my dayes:</hi> So ſhould we, make account every day, that this may be the day of my change; in every thing you do, make account that your change may begin then in that very action, and this will be a means to make you <hi>wait for your change,</hi> make you prepare for death. It is that that <hi>Druſius</hi> noteth of <hi>Rabbi Eleazer,</hi> that he gave his counſel and advice, that, <hi>a man ſhould be ſure to repent one day before he died.</hi> He meant not that a man ſhould defer his repentance till it did evidently, that Death had ſeized upon him, But becauſe a man may conclude, if it be poſſible I may live to day, it is probable I may die to morrow, therefore I will repent to day. Do it now, and do not delay it till to morrow.</p>

               <p>Firſt, in matter of ſinning, be careful to amend ſin every day, labour to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſin this day, as if thou ſhouldeſt have no more dayes to mortifie it in, take heed of ſinning now as if thou ſhouldeſt die now.
<note place="margin">1. In matter of ſinning. Acts 5.</note> Some we ſee have been taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the very act of ſin: <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphirah</hi> were taken away in the very act of ſinning, when they were telling a lie to the Apoſtle they died: <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi> were ſlain in the very act of uncleanneſſe: <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, they died in the act of murmuring, and reſiſting of God, and his ordinances, and miniſters. Let a man now reaſon with himſelf, theſe were taken away in their ſins, it may be my caſe as well as theirs, if I be found in ſin. That is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. In redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the time of life:</note> bring it home to this particular alſo, in another caſe, and that is, in redeeming of the opportunities of the time of our life. Beſides, the general time of life, there be certain opportunities, certain advantages of time, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth ſeaſons: be careful to redeem them: though you may enjoy your lives, yet you may have none of theſe; ſuch as are ſeaſons of glorifying God, ſeaſons of doing good, ſeaſons of gaining good to a mans ſelf, be careful therefore (I ſay) to mannage thoſe opportunities, and advantages of time, ſo that you may glorifie God: <hi>Whether you eat or drink,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.35</note> 
                  <hi>or what ſoever you do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> Which way ſoever you may moſt advance Gods glory, and pormote his worſhip, which way ſoever ye may promote the cauſe of God; drawing men to God, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them in the wayes of God; which way ſoever you may be uſeful, employ your ſelf at that time, the preſent time, becauſe you muſt die, and you may die now, you may have no more opportunities to do it in. And ſo likewiſe in all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
<note place="margin">Heb. 3 13. Gal. 6.10.</note> wherein men may do good to men, <hi>Exhort one another while it is called to day, and while you have time do good unto all:</hi> Do all the ſpiritual good, and all the outward good that you can, while you have ſeaſons to do good. <hi>Happy is that ſervant, that his maſter ſhall find ſo doing, when he cometh,</hi> leading a fruitful and profitable life. So, do good to your own ſouls while you have time: pray, while you have time to pray, hear the Word while you have time to hear it: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe repentance, while you have time to repent: perfect the work of mortification, while you have time to mortifie your corruptions: do your ſouls all the good you can, by the advantages of all the ordinances, of all the opportunities that God hath given you. This is the end of all men? it hath been the end of good and bad before; and it ſhall be the end of good and bad now; men muſt die, their houſes will be <hi>houſes of mourning,</hi> therefore mannage the time in doing all the good you can, that God may be glorified, men may be benefited, and your own ſouls fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered; that is the ſecond thing.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">3. In the manner of our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> in the manner of your converſation, conſider the time that you have to do every thing in. Will a man be found idleing in the market-place, when he ſhould be working in the Vineyard? Would you be feaſting, when God would have you mourning? you ſhall ſee ſome that have been taken away, when they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thought of it: <hi>Belſhazzer,</hi> he was in his feaſts, and then cometh the ſentence of death againſt him, and other the like examples you may ſee in the Scripture. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider therefore the particular actions that you doe, whether they be ſuch as hold agreement with the ſtate of a dying man. So for the manner of doing holy duties Would you be found praying pefunctorily, and careleſly? Would you be found coming to the Sacrament unprepared? What though you do holy actions, that are good for the matter, would you be found doing of them, with unfit and unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hearts? You ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>For this cauſe many are ſick, and weak, and many ſleep:</hi> they ſlept, they were dead for this, even becauſe they came unworthily to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Would you therefore be found doing of holy duties, and not in a right manner? The ſerious conſideration of this, that <hi>Death is the end of all men,</hi> with the particular application of it to a mans ſelfe, that as it is the ſtate of all men, ſo it is mine in particular, <pb n="25" facs="tcp:47453:19"/>I muſt die, and I may die now; it hath an influence into all the actions of a mans life.</p>
               <p>To conclude.

               <p>Firſt, to moderate the mourning of Chriſtians for the death of others. Why? It is <hi>the end of all men,</hi> it is that that is the common condition of all men, it ſhould not be too grievous,
<note place="margin">1. To mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our mourning for the death of others.</note> not too doleful to any man. We would not have our freinds to be in another condition in their birth then others, we would not have them have more fingers, or more members then a man, and would we have them have more dayes? Let this ſerve as a brief touch upon that.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove he life of others.</note> it teacheth us to make good uſe of our fellowſhip while we are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Not only we may die, but thoſe that are uſeful to us may die alſo: let us make good uſe of one another, while we live therefore. This will make the death of others bitter, and will be worſe than the death, and loſſe of our freinds, the guilt upon a mans conſcience, that he hath not made that uſe of them while they were alive, that he might have done: let us therefore make the death of our freinds eaſie, by making good uſe of them while they live. It did ſmite the heart of thoſe Epheſians, that they <hi>ſhould ſee the face of Paul no more;</hi> ſpecially above the reſt it grieved them, that they ſhould ſee him no more, how would it have grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them think you, if they had alwayes hardned themſelves againſt his miniſtry before? Think with your ſelves ſeriouſly, here is ſuch a Miniſter, ſuch a Chriſtian freind, that husband and wife, that parent and child, a time of parting will come; let us make it eaſie now, by making good uſe of one another while we live, that when freinds are took away, we may have cauſe to thank God, that we have had communion, and confort of their fellowſhip and ſociety, the benefit of their graces, the fruit of their lives: and not ſorrow for the want of them by death. So much for that.</p>
               <p>I come now to the ſecond, and principal reaſon, why it is <hi>better to go to the houſe of mourning, then to the houſe of feaſting, it is this, becauſe the living ſhall lay it to his heart,</hi> What ſhall <hi>he lay to his heart? That that is the end of all mèn;</hi> he ſhall lay the death of all men to heart.</p>
               <p>The point I obſerve from hence is thus much.<lb/>
                  <hi>It is the dutie of thoſe that live,

               </p>
               <p>That is, ſeriouſly ro conſider, and make uſe for themſelves of the death of others. You ſee the Text is clear for the point.</p>
               <p>And there is good reaſon why it ſhould be ſo.</p>

               <p>Secondly, in reſpect of the good that cometh to our ſelves by it. Firſt, God is glorified by this, when we lay to heart the death of others: there is a diſhonour to God to ſlight any of his actions: this is one of Gods works in the world, the death of men: this is a thing wherein Gods hand is ſeen: he ſaith to the ſons of <hi>Adam, Return. The ſpirit returneth to God that gave it. It is he that hath the power of life and death.</hi> If a <hi>ſparrow fall not to the ground, without the providence of God;</hi> much leſſe the ſervants of God, the precious ones upon the earth, the <hi>excellent ones,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> calleth them. I ſay, God is ſeen much in theſe works, and it is a great diſhonour to God, when men do not conſider the works of his hands: <hi>David</hi> by the ſpirit of propheſie in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.5.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 28.5.</note>

There be three ſpecial things conſiderable in the death of any one, that is matter of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and benefit to thoſe that live, and ſurvive after them.</p>
               <list>

                  <item>Therein we ſee the Nature, of Death.</item>
                  <item>Therein we ſee the Cauſe &amp; End of Death.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. Thereby we come to ſee the certainty of death.</note> therein we ſee the certainty of death: For now we have not only the word of God that tels us that we ſhall die, but the works of God taking others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: that as the Sacraments are called viſible inſtructions, becauſe they teach by the eye, and the outward ſenſes: ſo the death of others are viſible inſtructions to the living, it teacheth by the eye: a man is guided by the eye, to ſee his own condition, and as it were in a glaſſe, there is repreſented to him his own ſtate: what we are, they were once: the time was that they converſt with men as we do, that they ſpake for Gods glory upon earth as we do; and what they are now we ſhall be, there will come a time when our works ſhall ceaſe as theirs do, when we ſhall be in the <hi>place of ſilence,</hi> as they are. I ſay, it confirmeth to us the former certainty, and aſſurance of our death, when we ſee others fall before us. And there is great profit and benefit that ariſeth out of this. This is neceſſary to awaken mens drowſineſſe, and to quicken up mens dulneſſe to a ſerious conſideration of that that is ſo uſefull to themſelves. A man would wonder, that in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where ſo many thouſands died, (for the hand of God was out againſt them for their murmuring and rebellion, and they were deſtroyed by the deſtroyer, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.) that there <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould pray, <hi>Lord teach us to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our dayes, that we may apply our hearts to wiſdome:</hi> though they had a ſight of ſo many dying before them, and that continually, yet they needed to be ſtirred up to pray, that God would teach them to make uſe of it. So it is with us. We have ſeen not only one or two die before us, but there was a time not long ſince (and you cannot forget it) wherein the deſtroying Angel did walk at liberty about the Citie, and kill thouſands in our ſtreets, yet when ſo many died, what ſecurity was there even among thoſe that lived? in ſo much that after awhile the ſickneſſe grew common, and uſual, and ſo, unregarded. Have we not need then as much as ever <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had in the Wilderneſſe, to crie to God, <hi>to teach us to number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts to wiſdome?</hi> Nay, much more now, when there is ſcarce one, or none, in compariſon of thoſe multitudes that were ſwept away in that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, we have need of ſuch helps as theſe are, and to joyn our prayers with them too, that we may be ſtirred up to a ſerious application of it to our ſelves. That's the firſt thing; it is neceſſary for living men to take to heart the death of thoſe that are departed, that they may ſee, and be brought ſeriouſly to think of the certainty of their own death.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Thereby we come to ſee the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of death. The proper worke of death.</note> therein alſo we ſee the nature of death, what the proper work of it in the world is; It is of ſingular uſe too. The nature of death, the proper work of it, is to diſ-unite, to ſeparate, to diſ-joyn things: here you have the ſoul ſeparated from the body: the eſtate ſeparated from the man; the man ſeparated from his friends, and all by Death. Firſt (I ſay) ye have the body ſeparated from the ſoul: and this is a uſeful conſideration. The ſoul and the body, while they keep together in a man,
<note place="margin">1. To ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the body from the ſoule.</note> they may be helpful, and uſeful one to another; the time will come when they muſt be ſeparated. Alas! the not conſidering of this, is the cauſe of thoſe great errours, that are in the lives of men: that they beſtow ſo much time upon their bodies, that they ſo much mind the preſent things of this life and their <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47453:20"/>outward welfare, as if they had no ſouls at all to regard; as if there never ſhould be a ſeparation of body and ſoul one from another. What is the reaſon that there is all that care took, for food for the body? for apparel for the body? for health for the body? and ſuch an utter neglect of the ſoul? but becauſe that men doe not dream, do not thing of a time of ſeparation, of a time of diſ-junction, of a time of parting theſe two. All the work of a mans life, ſhould now be to make a good uſe of the faculties of his ſoul, that the body may be happy by it: the ſoul will draw the body after it to its own eſtate. Now they are together, if they joyne now in ſin: after there ſeparation, there ſhall come a time, when they ſhall be joyned in puniſhment: if they joyn now in the ſervice of God; after they have been ſeparated a while by death, there will come a time, when they ſhall be again joyned in glory and happineſſe. That is the firſt; There will be a ſeparation of ſoul and body: therefore make good uſe of them, while they are together: let the body be ſerviceable to the ſoul, by all its ſenſes and members: let the ſoul rule, and order the body, by its underſtanding and affections, &amp;c. that both body and ſoul may be made bleſſed in an eternall conjunction together after death, and in an everlaſting union in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. To ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a man from his eſtate.</note> Death makes a ſeparation between a man, and all his outward eſtate in the world. The rich man in Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 12. thought not upon this: <hi>Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years;</hi> he thought his ſoul, and his goods, ſhould never have parted, <hi>therefore take now thine eaſe,</hi> ſaith he. See what the end of it was; <hi>Thou fool</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>this night they ſhall fetch away thy ſoul, and then whoſe ſhall theſe things be?</hi> The time is coming, that theſe things ſhall be none of thine, they ſhall be another mans, they ſhall be ſome bodies elſe, they ſhall be taken from thee. How neceſſary is this conſideration, to take off mens affections from the world, and to ſtir them up to uſe their wealth, and their eſtates, while they have them, ſo as may make for the glory of God? A time ſhall come, that they ſhall not have it to uſe, that nothing ſhall be left them, but a bare account to be given up, <hi>Give an account of thy Stewardſhip, Luke</hi> 16. The main buſineſſe is now to be done, while a man and his wealth are together, while a man and his eſtate continueth together, to uſe it to Gods glory, otherwiſe it will be a woeful, and heavy parting, when death ſhall come to make a ſeparation. The young man went away ſorrowful, when Chriſt would have his wealth from him, becauſe he had great poſſeſſions. How ſorrowful will a man go out of the world, when he hath a great deal of wealth, but he hath not prepared his account: he cannot give up a reckoning of his getting of it, of his uſing &amp; imploying of it? it is neceſſary therefore (I ſay) that men take to heart the death of thoſe that die before them, that when they ſee the bodies, and ſouls of men parted, men and their eſtates parted, they may learn how to uſe their bodies &amp; ſouls, themſelves and their eſtates, while they are yet joyned together.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. To ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a man from his friends.</note> Death doth not only part a mans body and ſoul, a mans ſelf and his wealth, but it parteth a man from his friends, from all his worldly accquaintance, from all thoſe that he took delight in upon earth: Death makes a ſeparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween husband and wife: ſee it in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> though <hi>Abraham</hi> loved <hi>Sarah</hi> dearely,

               <p>This is a neceſſary conſideration for us that live, that we may learn to know how to carry ourſelves towards our wordly friends, and how to moderate our ſelves in <pb n="28" facs="tcp:47453:21"/>our enjoyment of theſe worldly comforts. Look upon every worldly thing as a mortal, as a dying comfort. Look upon children and friends, as dying comforts. Look upon your eſtates, as that that hath wings, and will be gone. Look upon your bodies, that now you make ſo much of, as a thing that muſt be parted from the ſoul by death, and that ere long.</p>
               <p>See what advice the Apoſtle giveth,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.19.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. the time is ſhort (ſaith he) therefore <hi>let thoſe that marry, be as if they married not: and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not: and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not: and they that uſe this world as not abuſing it.</hi> A man abuſeth the world, when he uſeth it beyond the conſideration of the ſhortneſſe of enjoying theſe things: when he looks upon theſe things, as things that he ſhall enjoy alwayes. But if we would uſe it aright, look upon things, as things that we ſhall enjoy, but for a ſhort time. This body that ſeemeth now to have ſome beauty in it, yet it muſt die, &amp; be laid in the duſt: theſe friends that ſeem now to have ſome pleaſure, and delight in them, yet I muſt die, and be took from them: this eſtate and wealth, that now I ſet ſo much price upon, I muſt die, and death will part me and it. So I ſay, look upon every thing as ſeparable from us.</p>
               <p>Moderate your affections likewiſe to them. Uſe them onely as comforts in the way, as a traveller doth the pleaſures of his Inn, he ſtands not to build himſelf houſes againſt every pleaſant walk he looks upon, he ſtands not to purchaſe lands, and to lay them to every Inn he comes to lie at; No, he knows that he is now but in his paſſage, in his way, he knows that he is not at home, that is the place he is going to, and after a time he ſhall come thither. So make account that you are not now at home, it is death that muſt help you to your home. Let this therefore take you off from all theſe things that are in the way.</p>
               <p>It is a ſtrange thing, to ſee how Sathan beſotteth, and befooleth men. They ſtrive, and labour to compaſſe many worldly things, as if their happineſſe ſtood in the enjoyment of them, as if they ſhould have their wealth, and their comforts for ever. What care is there amongſt men to get wealth, and many times loſe their ſouls in getting the world? Alas! Death will part ſoul and body, them and their wealth and all. Do we not ſee this daily in the death of others before us: ſuch a one is dead, where is his body now? in the duſt. Where are his friends, and his companions now? Where is his wealth and his eſtate, for which many flattered him and fawned upon him? are they not all ſeparated from him? they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now to do with him: he cannot diſpoſe of one penny of his eſtate now, it is left he knows not to whom, others now have the mannaging of it. As now you can ſay this of others, ſo there will a time come, that other men will ſay the like of you, I had ſuch a friend, but death hath parted him from me, he had ſuch an eſtate, but death hath parted him and his eſtate. Let us therefore make this uſe of the death of others, to conclude with our ſelves, that there will be a parting of all thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, that now we are ſo apt to dote upon.</p>
               <p>The third ſpecial thing conſiderable in the death of others,
<note place="margin">3. Thereby we come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the end, and cauſe of death.</note> that will be matter of profit, and benefit to thoſe that live, and ſurvive after them is, the end and cauſe for which God ſendeth Death abroad into the world with ſuch a large commiſſion, that it goeth on with ſuch liberty to every family, to every place, that it ſeizeth upon every perſon. What's the reaſon of it?</p>
               <p>You ſhall ſee in the ſeveral deaths of men, ſeveral cauſes. There is judgement and mercy; ſometime a mixture of both, and ſometime but of one of theſe.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, we ſee an apparant judgement of God in the death of ſome.</p>
               <p>A judgement of God upon themſelves. Thus the young Prophet that diſobeyed the word of the Lord, a Lyon met him in the way and ſlew him. So thoſe Corinths, that <hi>did eat and drink unworthily in the Lords Supper,</hi> though they were ſuch as were ſaved after, yet nevertheleſſe <hi>for this very cauſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſome of them were ſick and weak, and ſome ſlept; they died, they were judged of the Lord, that they might not be condemned with the world.</hi> When you ſee death ſeizing upon men, as an act of divine judgement, of divine diſpleaſure, let it make you more fearful of ſinning againſt God, leſt you provoke againſt your ſelves the ſame warth, in the very act of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:47453:21"/>
Sometimes again, it is a judgement of God upon others. Thus God takes away divers of his ſervants, becauſe the world is not worthy of them.</p>
               <p>And as this is an act of judgement upon the world, ſo it is an act of mercy to them; God in mercy taking of them away from the evil to come, and from the evil preſent. A judgement of God to others that are udworthy of them: A mercy to themſelves, that they are took away, from their own evil, from ſin, from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, from all the effects and fruits of ſin; and taken away from the evil that is to come upon others.</p>
               <p>An act (I ſay) of mercy to them. So it was to the child of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> he ſhould die, and ſhould not ſee the judgement that was to come upon his fathers houſe,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 14.13</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe there was found ſome good thing in him toward the Lord.</hi> So it was to <hi>Joſiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 34.18.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhould be gathered to his fathers in peace, and his eyes ſhould not ſee all that evill which the Lord would bring upon Jeruſalem, and upon the inhabitants thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An act of judgement to others.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Righteous and merciful men are taken away, and no man layeth it to heart:</hi> they conſider not the cauſes wherefore God takes away thoſe good men. A Land, a Kingdom, a State, a People, a place is much weakned, when thoſe that are righteous, and merciful men; when thoſe that ſtand in the gap, and uſe their endeavours to prevent judgments, are taken away. The houſe will certainly fall, when the Pillars are removed. They are the people of God only, that hold up a ſtate; that hold up the world. Aſſoon as <hi>Noah</hi> is put into the Ark, preſently cometh the deluge upon the World. Aſſoon as ever <hi>Lot</hi> was got up to <hi>Zoar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 9.4, 5.</note> preſently the Lord rained down fire and brimſtone upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> Aſſoon as ever the mourners are marked, preſently cometh the deſtroying Angel upon the reſt.</p>
               <p>Beloved, when we ſee thoſe that are mourners for the evils of the times, and places where they live look away, we ſhould lay it to heart, and conſider it as a ſign of Gods diſpleaſure, as a ſign that he is a going, and departing, when he takes away his jewels, as a ſign that he is a coming to judge the world, when he beginneth to ſeparate, to take to himſelf his own. Certainly, as ſoon as ever that number of the elect ſhall be accompliſhed, when the company of thoſe that God hath determined to eternal life ſhall be fulfilled, when the ſheep of Chriſt, that are yet to be brought into his fold, are gathered together, when the fulneſſe of the Gentiles is come in, and the nation of the <hi>Jewes</hi> added, then the world ſhall he burnt with fire, and the day of Judgement ſhall come, nothing ſhall hinder that general deſtruction, that ſhall be the end of all things here below. As it is with the general Judgement of the world, ſo with particular Judgements upon Nations, when God takes away his people, when the Saints go out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Pila,</hi> then cometh the ſword of the enemie upon <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> when God drawes out his own people, preſently cometh judgement upon the reſt. It is good to obſerve Gods method and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he takes in governing of the world at this day, that in the death of the ſervants of God, we may conſider our own time, that we may prepare for thoſe evils that are a coming, and for thoſe greater judgments that are haſtning.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what uſe may be made of laying to heart the death of others; God is much glorified thereby. For all his attributes are ſeen in all his works, and the glorifying of God, is a declaring of God to be as glorious, as he hath revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be in his attributes, which is, by ſhewing of them forth in his works. When men can ſee the wiſedome, the juſtice, the power, the mercy, the truth, the ſoveraignty of God, and all in the death of others, then they glorifie God in taking to heart the death of others.</p>
               <p>You ſee likewiſe what good cometh to a mans ſelf by laying to heart the death of others. He ſees thereby the certainty of his own death. He ſees the nature of death, and what the proper work of it is, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſeparate between him and all thoſe outward comforts, all thoſe props and ſtaies whereupon his heart reſted too much on earth, in the dayes of his vanity. And laſtly, he ſees the end, and cauſe, why God ſendeth Death into the world: ſometime in judgement, that men ſhould take heed of ſin: ſometimes in mercy; in mercy to the men themſelves, and in <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47453:22"/>mercy alſo to thoſe that live, that they ſeeing the ſervants of God lodged up before the tempeſt, may learn to fear, and to hide and ſecure themſelves under Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial providence, who can either hide them amongſt the living, or the dead, in the worſt times.</p>
               <p>Now let us conclude with ſome application to our ſelves.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1: For reproof. of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall neglect of this duty.</note> In the firſt place, it ſerveth for the juſt reproof of that great neglect that is in the world at this day, <hi>that men lay not to heart the death of others.</hi> I wiſh that this were only the ſin of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men. I know to a worldly man it is of all things the moſt unpleaſant thought that can be to think of death: he cannot indure to hear this, <hi>they ſhall fetch thy ſoul from thee.</hi> It is as unpleaſant to him, as it is to a Bankrupt to hear of a Sergeant coming to arreſt him: as unpleaſant as it is to a Malefactor to hear of being brought before the Judge. And that is the reaſon why men in the time of feaſting, cannot endure ſuch diſcourſes at their Tables, as might put ſad thoughts of death into them; oh! theſe are too melancholly thoughts. Yea, but in the mean time it is thy folly, thy want of wiſedome. He that was guided by the ſpirit of wiſedome, and had now bought ſome wiſdome at a deare rate, by woeful experience of his former follies; he now ſeeth that it was farre better to go to the houſe of mourning, that is, ſeriouſly to conſider of that, which men account the moſt ordinary cauſe of mourning, that is, the death of others, and of themſelves: then to go to the houſe of feaſting, that is, to ſport a mans ſelfe in the pleaſures of the world, and to give liberty to a mans ſelfe to all manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
               <p>But (I ſay) I wiſh that this were their fault onely, and that it may die with them. But it is too much the fault of Gods own people. <hi>Moſes</hi> is fain to pray for <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, where they ſaw ſo many die before them, <hi>that God would give them wiſdom to number their dayes.</hi> And Miniſters have ſtill the ſame cauſe to pray for the people, and Chriſtians to pray one for another, that God would give them wiſdome to lay to heart the death of other men.</p>
               <p>Have you well conſidered of Death, when you can only diſcourſe, that ſuch a one that was profitable in his inſtruction, is dead: ſuch a one by whom we have had good in converſing with, is dead: ſuch a one that was young, and likely to live many years longer, is dead? What of all this? this is but idle, and empty diſcourſe. What uſe makeſt thou of this to thy ſelf? doſt thou gather from thence the certainty of thy own death? Doſt thou conſider what death will do to thee when it cometh? how that it will ſeparate between thee and all things in the world, as it hath done them. Doſt thou conſider for what cauſe God ſendeth Death abroad into the world? Doſt thou conſider this with thy ſelfe, as thou oughteſt to do? This is an act of wiſdome, This is that we call due conſideration, when the ſoul reflects upon it ſelf; it is their caſe now, and it will be mine, and mine in the ſame manner, therefore it is good for me, to ſet my accounts ſtrait with God. When thou accompanieſt another to the grave, doſt thou conclude thus with thy ſelf, the very next time that any death is ſpoken of, it may be mine, or as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Saphirah</hi> after the death of <hi>Annanias, the feet of thoſe that have buried thy husband are at the door, and ſhall carry thee out alſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is reaſon of all that worldly-mindedneſſe, of all that earneſtneſſe, and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to gain the favour of men by indirect means, this is the reaſon of all that immoderate care about our buſineſſe with the neglect of our ſouls, this is the reaſon of all that carnal ſecurity, of all that forgetfulneſſe of God, and the account that ſhall be made at the day of Judgment, this is the reaſon of the unfruitfulneſſe of our lives, of our unprofitable ſpending of our times, or of whatſoever elſe it be, this is even the very reaſon of all, becauſe even thoſe that profeſſe themſelves to be the people of God, and to give God the glory of his attributes in all his works, yet they lay not to heart the death of thoſe that are before them. Men durſt not, they could not, paſſe away their time in ſuch unprofitableneſſe, and unfruitfulneſſe as they do, if they did ſeriouſly conſider, and lay to heart, the death of others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:47453:22"/>
Again ſecondly;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For reproof.</note> As it condemnes the general neglect that is amongſt men of this duty, ſo it ſerves to reprove, that ſinful laying to heart of the death of others that is too frequent and common in the world,</p>
               <p>That is,
<note place="margin">1. Of the exceſs of ſorrow for dead freinds.</note> firſt, when men with too much fondneſſe, and with too great exceſſe and diſtemper of affection, look upon their dead friends, as if God could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the loſſe, nor make amends for that he hath done in taking of them away. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel mourneth, and will not be comforted. David</hi> mourneth, and will ſcarce be comforted. <hi>Oh Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon, would God I had died for thee.</hi> What is all this, but to look on freinds, rather as Gods then men, as if all ſufficiency were included in them only? Men look on their freinds, as <hi>Micah</hi> did upon his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol, when they had bereaved him of it, they took away all his comfort and quiet, <hi>You have taken away my Gods</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and what have I more?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Judg. 8.24.</note> or as <hi>Laban,</hi> that when his Idols were ſtoln away, his heart was dead, he could not ſtay in his houſe,
<note place="margin">Gen 31.30.</note> he could not enjoy himſelfe, <hi>wherefore have you ſtollen away my Gods?</hi> ſaith he. So, I ſay, men look on their dead freinds as they ſhould look upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and not as upon the creature; they take their death to heart, but not in a right manner.</p>
               <p>This is the very reaſon why God many times makes your Chriſtian freinds ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to you when they live, becauſe you idolize them, you advance them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove God.</p>
               <p>This is the reaſon alſo, why you are ſo unable to bear the loſſe of them when they die, God beating you now with your own rod, and making you feel the fruit and effect of your own folly. This now is an ill taking to heart the death of freinds, to mourn as men without hope.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Of the raſh cenſuring of the manner of others death.</note> there is a taking to heart, and conſidering of the death of men, but it is an unrighteous conſidering, an unrighteous judging of the death of others. If men ſee one die, it may be a violent death, then they conclude, certainly there is ſome apparent token of Gods judgment on ſuch a one. If they ſee another die, with ſome extremity of torment, and vehement pains, certainly there is ſome appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent evidence of Gods wrath upon this man. If they ſee another in ſome great and violent tentation, ſtrugling againſt many tentations, they conclude preſently, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſuch are in a worſer caſe then others. I may ſay to all theſe, as Chriſt ſaid once to thoſe that told him of the eighteen men upon whom the Tower in <hi>Siloe</hi> fell think you that <hi>they were ſinners above all men that dwelt in Jeruſalem?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 13.4. Eccleſ. 9.2.</note> Or rather as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, All things come alike unto all, there <hi>is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not; as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</hi> Learn to judge righteous judgment, to judge wiſely of the death of others, take heed of condemning the generation of the juſt.</p>
               <p>But rather,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. For Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</note> in the laſt place. Make this uſe of the death of every one. Doth ſuch a man die by an ordinary ſickneſſe, having his underſtanding, and memory continued to the end? Doth ſuch a man die in inward peace and comfort, with cleare and evident apprehenſions of Gods love,
<note place="margin">Luke 2.29.</note> ſo that he can with <hi>Simeon</hi> ſay, <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace?</hi> What uſe ſhouldeſt thou that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt make of this now? Certainly, let the ſweetneſſe of their death, make thee in love with the goodneſſe of their lives. That is the only way to a happy death, to a comfortable end indeed, the leading of a fruitful and profitable life.</p>
               <p>Again, doſt thou ſee the Children of God full of temptations, full of fears and diſquietneſſe of ſpirit in their death? Sometimes ſo overcome with the violence of the diſeaſe, as that (it may be) they ſpeak impertinently and idely, it may be ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? What uſe ſhouldeſt thou make of this now? Certainly let the terribleneſs of the example of ſuch a mans death, let it be a terrour to thee, and a means to ſtir thee up to more carefulneſſe of making good uſe of thy time in this life. <hi>Nabal</hi> dieth, <hi>and his heart is in him as a ſtone.</hi> If ever God quicken thee, if ever God breath upon thy ſoule, or enliven thee by the inward motions of his Spirit, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thoſe opportunities, and ſeaſons of grace, leſt God ſmite thee with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deadneſſe. Again, hath God cauſed the light of his countenance to ſhine <pb n="32" facs="tcp:47453:23"/>upon thy heart? Doth he offer a gracious meſſage of peace to thy ſoule? Doth he ſpeak peace at any time by the miniſtery of his Word? Imbrace thoſe offers, yeeld to thoſe conditions of peace, leſt thou be deprived of peace at the end. Againe, hath GOD given thee any ſtrength over temptations? Haſt thou prevailed over the aſſaults of Sathan, and other of thy enemies? Hath he made thee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour? take heed how thou inſnareſt thy ſelfe againe, how thou inthralleſt thy ſelf in yeelding to Sathans yoke, leſt he buffet thee by him in a worſe manner at thy end.</p>
               <p>Thus (I ſay) thou canſt ſee nothing befal any of Gods ſervants in their death, or in the manner of their death, whether in be more pleaſing, or more ſorrowful, more calm and quiet, or more tempeſtuous, and full of trouble; whether it be more comfortable, or more lamentable, but it may be uſeful unto thee. If it be good, it may be it ſhall be ſo with thee, if it be bad, it may be it ſhall be ſo with thee too. The main buſineſſe that a man hath to do, is to make ſure of himſelf in this life. It was the queſtion that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> made to thoſe that told him of a violent death that ſeized upon one. <hi>But how did he live?</hi> (ſaith he) He made no matter how he went out, but how he carried himſelf in the world. And truly this is the great Queſtion, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ſhould put to his ſoule. I muſt out of the world, how have I lived when I was in the world? had GOD any glory by me? had men any good by me? have I furthered my account againſt the day of reckoning, that I may give it up with joy? it makes no matter how I go out of the world, I am ſure if my life have been ſerviceable to God, and beneficial to men, my departure ſhall be for gain and advantage, it is for a better world.</p>
               <p>Thus much ſhall ſerve briefly for the opening of theſe words, and for that that is appliable from them.</p>
               <p>For the preſent occaſion a word.</p>
               <p>Funeral Sermons are not intended for the praiſe of the dead, but for the comfort of the living. Therefore I have choſen ſuch an argument to handle at this time, as might be of uſe, and profit to you that live. Beſides that, I am in particular, and by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular order, debarred of ſpeaking any thing concerning our deceaſed Siſter, though I might have ſpoken much, and that very uſeful to you. The beſt uſe that you can make will be this, to conſider the life that ſhe led amongſt you. She was a pattern, and example of holineſſe, of a wiſe and upright carrirge in her wayes: follow her in that: <hi>Mark the Godly and upright man, the end of that man is peace.</hi> There was none that knew her, but upon good aſſurance are perſwaded of her happineſſe now. Would you then have the ſame happineſſe after? take the ſame courſe that ſhe did, be much in prayer, and dependance upon the ordinances, and in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the ſervants of God; be profitable in doing good, profitable in receiving good: mannage the opportunities and times well that God giveth you, as ſhe did, gaining much in little: ſhe did much work in a ſhort ſpace: let that be your care, and then this will be your comfort in the end. Thus if you make this uſe of the death of others before you, you ſhall prepare for your own death, and that ſhall be only a paſſage for you to Eternal life.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe words that I have read, (to let paſs other parts of the Chapter) the Apoſtle ſets down the humiliation of Chriſt with the fruit of it; His humiliation in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and death. The fruit of it in ſubduing <hi>him that had the power of death, and delivering thoſe that were kept under the fear of death in bondage all their life.</hi> At this time we will ſpeak only of the laſt part, the fruit of Chriſts death, in <hi>delivering thoſe that were kept under the fear of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The perſons that are kept under this <hi>fear,</hi> are ſaid to be the <hi>children;</hi> Gods own children, thoſe for whom Chriſt died, yet they were <hi>kept under the fear of death,</hi> and that not at ſome particular time, when tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had got ſome ſpecial advantage over them, but it was a trouble, and a burden to them <hi>all their life long,</hi> and that not a ſmall burden, or an eaſie trouble, but ſuch as kept them as in bondage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47453:24"/>
The words (you ſee) are eaſie; There are two points that ariſe from them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that Gods children, thoſe for whom Chriſt died, are many times <hi>hold</hi> ſtrongly <hi>under the fear of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that Chriſt by his death freeth them from thoſe fears.</p>
               <p>I ſhall onely inſiſt at this time principally on the firſt;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſervat.</hi> Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the fear of death.</note> That Gods own children, the <hi>Children that were partakers of fleſh and bloud</hi> (it is taken either for the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, or the infirmities of that nature) even theſe children were <hi>held under the feare of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will ſhew the grounds of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fear of death</hi> in the children of God, ariſeth either from ſome cauſes without, or from ſomewhat within them.</p>
               <p>From without them,
<note place="margin">The outward cauſes of the fear of death.</note> and ſo the fear ariſeth from God, an act of his providence upon his children.</p>
               <p>Or from Sathan, a work of his malice. Theſe are the cauſes from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
               <p>For the firſt,
<note place="margin">1. God.</note> God in his providence, and that in his ſpecial and fatherly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whereby he doth order all things for the good of his children, for the preſent increaſe of their grace, and the fitting them for glory hereafter; He (I ſay) in his providence ordereth it thus, that they ſhall be kept (many of them) a great while <hi>under the feare of death,</hi> and this he doth for ſpecial good ends.</p>
               <p>The firſt is,
<note place="margin">To humble his children.</note> to humble them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> as ſoon as he had ſinned againſt God, as his fall was by pride (he would have had a higher condition then he was in) ſo when God would bring him back again, he beginneth firſt to humble him: and how doth he that? <hi>Duſt thou art</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and to duſt thou ſhalt return:</hi> he ſheweth him, that he was a dead man by ſin, and ſo would have the meditation of death to humble <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all his poſterity after him.</p>
               <p>So <hi>David,</hi> when he deſired that ſome means might work upon his enemies for their good,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 9.20.</note> he prayeth, <hi>Put them in fear, that they may know that they are but men:</hi> He doth not onely pray that mortality might be preſented to them, but ſo preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it might leave an impreſſion of <hi>fear</hi> upon their affections, that they might know what they are, that they have not their beeing, or the power of ſubſiſting in themſelves, but that they muſt look for it above themſelves, to <hi>him that hath the iſſues of life and death</hi> in his own hand.</p>
               <p>And this is neceſſary, that all the ſervants of God ſhould be kept humble by ſome means or other. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (you ſee) he had attained a great meaſure of grace,
<note place="margin">2. Cor 12.</note> yet he ſtandeth in need of ſomething to humble him, <hi>therefore the meſſenger of Sathan was ſent to buffet him, that he ſhould not be exalted above meaſure,</hi> that he might be kept humble.</p>
               <p>God intendeth to raiſe up his children to a glorious eſtate, therefore as men lay a low foundation, when they intend to erect a high building; ſo God layeth the foundation, of all grace and comfort in his ſervants, in humiliation: therefore he will not only have them mortal, but he will have them apprehend their mortality, and dying condition with <hi>fear,</hi> that they may be humbled by this fear. That is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">To ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their. faith.</note> God aymeth at the ſtrengthening of faith in his ſervants. While a man looks to ſenſe, and is upheld by ſenſible comforts, there is not that exerciſe of faith: now every grace is ſtrengthened by exerciſe, that God therefore may have faith exerciſed, and ſo ſtrengthened in his ſervants, he will expoſe them to the <hi>fear of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> found this:
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>we received</hi> (ſaith he) the <hi>ſentence of death,</hi> that <hi>we might not turſt in our ſelves, but in him that raiſeth us up from the dead.</hi> He doth not onely ſay thus, we acknowledge this to be a truth, that we muſt die; but <hi>we received the ſentence of death,</hi> received it as a man receiveth a ſentence of death from a Judge, received it ſo, as it made ſome impreſſion upon our hearts, received it with ſome inward ſenſe, with ſome inward feare: which <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47453:24"/>was a violent work, ſuch a work as knocks us off of all holds, and takes us off from all ſenſible, and viſible props, and humane ſupports, and makes us to ſee nothing in the creature to do us that good we look for, to make us eternal happy: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were taught (ſaith he) <hi>not to truſt in our ſelves;</hi> if a man truſt any, he might truſt himſelfe firſt; yea, but we are dying, and cannot enjoy our ſelves long, therefore <hi>we truſt in him that raiſeth us up from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">To encreaſe their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</note> another end that God aymeth at, in holding his ſervants, many times <hi>under the fear of death,</hi> is, that he may make them more watchful, and holy in the courſe of their lives.</p>
               <p>This our Saviour expreſſeth under two parables,
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> the one of the <hi>Virgins</hi> that were to <hi>watch</hi> for the coming of the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> they knew that he would come, but they knew not when, therefore they were alwayes to keep their <hi>watch, with oyle in their lamps.</hi> And the other of a Maſter, that left Talents with his ſervants, he told them that he would come, but he told them not when, that they might be ſure to employ them to the beſt advantage.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> raiſeth an exhortation to this purpoſe, on this very ground:
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.1 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Since</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that all theſe things muſt be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlineſſe, looking for, and haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the appearance of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> We know that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will come, but he hath concealed the particular time of his coming, that we might alwayes keep our watch, and be prepared for him, whenſoever he cometh.</p>
               <p>Now, this is neceſſary for all the ſervants of God, for they are apt to be ſecure, and to be carried away with worldly buſineſs, and delights, and to neglect that which concerns their eternal good; and therefore God will affect them with the <hi>fear of death,</hi> that they may be ſtirred up to more watchfulneſſe and holineſſe, in a godly courſe of life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">To prepare them for death.</note> God doth it, that by the fear of Death they may be better prepared for death, that it may not come upon them as a ſtranger, that they never thought on before, that it may not <hi>come as an armed man</hi> upon them: therefore is it that God will have thim, not onely to have thoughts of it, but <hi>fear</hi> of it; <hi>fear</hi> (you know) is an affection, that quickneth a man to action, keeps him to a conſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of God.
<note place="margin">2 Chro. 20.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> when God did not onely bring a multitude of enemies upon him, but alſo ſent the report of them to him, and that in ſuch a manner, as he might be affected with <hi>fear;</hi> What did all this work in him? The text ſaith; <hi>Jehoſaphat did ſeek the Lord with all his heart, and proclaimed a faſt in Judah,</hi> and <hi>provided ſuch other defence,</hi> as was neceſſary; he ſaw nothing but fear and danger in the creature; <hi>We know not what to do with this great company, that cometh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us,</hi> this ſet him awork to <hi>ſeek the Lord with all his heart,</hi> and to make other proviſion againſt them. So the Lord will have his ſervants apprehend death as an <hi>Armed</hi> enemy coming upon them, that they may be better prepared to receive it, that they may get evidences of comfort, and aſſurance of heaven, and ſo may be fitted upon good grounds to entertain death with joy when it cometh.</p>
               <p>And this the ſervants of God have need of, becauſe if there be not ſomewhat to quicken to this, there are other things enough to pervert them from it: and then when men are moſt weak, and full of pain and wearineſſe, the divel takes advantage to caſt them off from all comfort, ſo that at the leaſt we ſhall die uncomfortably; if not miſerably, if they be not prepared beforehand to receive Death, and have gotten aſſurance, and evidence of a better condition afterward.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the firſt thing, that is, Gods act, and for what reaſons he keepeth his ſervants in this <hi>bondage of the fear of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again ſecondly,
<note place="margin">2. Sathan.</note> another cauſe from without, is from the malice of Sathan. His main aim is, to keep men from a Chriſtian courſe altogether: if that cannot be done; his next work is to make men go on as uncomfortably in it, as he can poſſible; therefore he will preſent them with as many fears, as may be: and becauſe that this is that that nature moſt abhorreth, (for it is the moſt natural deſire of man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his beeing) I ſay, becauſe nature moſt abhorreth this; this diſſolution and <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47453:25"/>deſtruction of it ſelf, therefore the ſtriveth to affect them with the <hi>fear of death,</hi> eſpecially and above all other. I ſay, this is Sathans malice. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he came to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> that he might do the work of the Lord, with leſſe diligence and comfort,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.5.</note> ſaith he, <hi>We had fears on every ſide, horrors within, and terrors without:</hi> It was Sathans deviſe, that the Apoſtle might do the work of the Lord with leſſe ſtrength and comfort, to afflict them with as many fears and horrors as he could. And he hath the ſame malice ſtill, and ſtill getteth much advantage of men, making men to go on with leſſe comfort in a godly life, adorning their profeſſion of religion leſſe, with unchearful walking, becauſe they have been <hi>held under the fear of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the cauſes that are from without.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">The inward cauſes of the fear of death. 1. Natural.</note> there are ſome cauſes from within, from the ſervants of God themſelves. And theſe cauſes whence <hi>the fear of death ariſeth,</hi> are either natural or ſinful.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the natural cauſes of it are; The apprehenſion of Death, as a thing contrary to nature: and according to the ſtrength of mens apprehenſion, ſo is there fear.</p>
               <p>Now Death in this natural reſpect, is fearful to every man, whether we conſider the object, or the ſubject, the thing or the perſon in whom it is, we ſhall find a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe of this, even in the ſervants of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the object,
<note place="margin">In reſpect of the object it ſelf: death.</note> look upon Death it ſelf, it hath all that in it, which makes it a fit object of fear. There be three things which makes a thing the object of fear, which makes a thing affect the heart with fear.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when it is conſidered as an ill.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when it is conſidered as an ill, difficult, and hard to be avoided.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when it is conſidered as an ill to come.</p>
               <p>For if it be not conceived a thing that is ill, but good; it is not feared, but rather deſired.</p>
               <p>And then again, if it be but a ſlight ill, ſuch as hath but a weak ſtrength in it, which a man may eaſily maſter, it is not fearful, but diſdained.</p>
               <p>And then thirdly, if it be an ill that hath ſtrength in it, and can hardly be reſiſted and overcome, if it be preſent, it is not feared, but grieved for.</p>
               <p>It muſt be evil apprehended as future, appreheneed as difficult, and apprehended as ill, if it be a thing that is to be feared.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe things are in Death, in the apprehenſion of Gods ſervants while they live.
<note place="margin">The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of death as an Ill.</note> Firſt, I ſay, they apprehend it as Ill.</p>
               <p>Ill is twofold, either that which is contrary to mans will, and ſo it is called <hi>Malum triſtitivum;</hi> or elſe contrary to mans nature, and ſo it is <hi>Malum corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Death is contrary to man in both theſe ſenſes, both to his nature, and to his will. It is a thing he would not have, becauſe it is contrary to his nature: and that is contrary to his nature, that ſeeks the deſtruction of nature. Now, when a man apprehendeth Death, as a thing that would deſtroy nature, that would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and diſſolve, and break in pieces, that goodly Fabrique, (as he conceiveth it) and make that ſomething to become nothing, it is a thing that nature cannot bear, it abhorreth. So the ſervants of God, as they have nature in them, they have this natural affection to preſerve their beeing: and this in it ſelf is not ſimply ſinful, but ſo far as it exceedeth the rule.</p>
               <p>Therefore you ſee that becauſe men apprehend Death, as an Ill contrary to nature, they prefer other things that are Ill, in a leſſe regard, in a leſſe degree before that: A man would rather part with his wealth, then part with his life, as we ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. A man would give God a ranſome for his ſoul if he could, he would give all his goods to ranſome his life. He would rather be poor then not at all: Nay, a man will part with his eaſe, with his health, rather then with his life: he will be in paine, rather then he will not be: <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will be give for his life:</hi> Nay,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.4.</note> a man will part with his credit and eſtimation, rather then with his life, he will rather be diſgraced, then not be: <hi>A living dog, is better then a dead lyon;</hi> this is the ſpeech of a man naturall: he preferreth a dog that hath life in him, before a Lyon that is dead; he would rather be a mean living man, then a dead Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:47453:25"/>
That is ths firſt thing, men naturally conceive Death, as a thing contrary to nature. So it is a natural Ill.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of death as an ill unavoidable.</note> as a man conceiveth Death an Ill contrary to nature, ſo he apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it an Ill not eaſily overcome. When <hi>Goliah</hi> looked on <hi>David,</hi> on the meanneſſe of his ſtature, and the ſlenderneſſe of his prepartation to fight, he conſidered him as an enemie, but as a weak one, and therefore inſtead of fearing, he diſdained him; <hi>Doſt thou come to me as a dog? I will give thy fleſh to the fowles of the heaven, and to the beaſts of the earth,</hi> he ſcorned him: But when the Hoſt of Iſrael looked on <hi>Goliah,</hi> as a mighty enemy, that they could not eaſily reſiſt, much leſſe overcome; the Text ſaith they were full of fear, becauſe of <hi>Goliah:</hi> the ſtrength of the adverſary was that that filled them with fear. So when a man looks upon Death, and ſeeth it come as a mighty armed man, provided with all weapons of war, ſeeth it come in to the moſt populous Cities (as in the peſtilence) and ſlayeth ten thouſand before it, ſeeth it come on the moſt ſtrong and valiant men, and breaks their bones, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth them; Who can ſtand before this <hi>Goliah, he that defieth the Hoſt of God, the hoſt of Iſrael?</hi> not only the wicked, but the ſervants of God are overcome by this enemy: I ſay, thus nature diſcourſeth, and thus a natural man apprehendeth Death, and therefore he conceiveth Death to be a fearful Ill, becauſe it is a thing that he cannot eaſily overcome; That is the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Death as an ill future.</note> he conceiveth it as a thing Future, as an Ill to come. I am yet living and in health, but how ſoon this health may turn to ſickneſſe, and this life to Death, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> know not; this is that that holdeth down the ſpirit <hi>under fear.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I ſhall ſall one day by the hand of Saul:</hi> one day; ſo ſaith a man that liveth now in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his buſineſſe, in abundance of ſtrength, and ability every way, I ſhall one day fall into the Grave, I ſhall one day fall into the hands of Death. <hi>Peter</hi> we know how he affected <hi>Saphira,</hi> with telling her of the death of her husband, and ſaith he, <hi>the feet of thoſe that carried out thy husband, ſhall carry thee out;</hi> this affected her with fear ſo that ſhe fell down dead upon the apprehenſion of it.</p>
               <p>Thus, I ſay, if we look upon the object, Death conſidered as an Ill, that is, a thing contrary to nature. Death conſidered again, as a ſtrong and mighty Gyant that none can overcome, but it overcometh them. And then conſidered again as a thing coming upon men now in the approach, and we know not how ſoon he will graſp a man in his hands, and ſeize upon him: this is that, I ſay, that cauſeth that natural fear, that is in the children of God.</p>
               <p>Then again conſider the Subject,
<note place="margin">In reſpect of the ſubject; men.</note> the perſon in whom the apprehenſion of ſuch an object is, and ſo likewiſe we ſhall ſee ſomewhat in the diſpoſitions of men, or in their ſtate and condition here, that may affect them with a natural fear of Death.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, ſome men by conſtitution are more melancholy, and are naturally of a more fearful temper, indeed diſtemper. The brain is diſtempered, the heart is diſtempered. The brain apprehends things, and looks upon them through a falſe glaſs, through a deluded fancie, and ſo makes a falſe report to the heart, preſenteth things more terrible then they are: ſo ſometimes the heart is ill affected, by the miſreport that is brought to it by the underſtanding: ſometimes both are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered, as that humor prevaileth more ſtrongly in the body. So alſo there are ſometimes raiſed up turbulent, and diſquieting, and voilent paſſions that make ſome full of fear, as we ſee in <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> whoſe knees did ſmite together, and all through the apprehenſion of death; and ſo <hi>Felix</hi> when he heard of death and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, he trembled. Though the fear of theſe men did not riſe from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, but from inward guilt of conſcience, yet the effect ſheweth, that when men are affected with the apprehenſion of Death in the worſt ſight and opprehenſion of it, it cauſeth fear and terrour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it cometh in others, and generally in all from weakneſs of nature, which in ſome is more then others, according to their different conſtitutions and educations; ſo the rich many times are more fearful of death then the poor, becauſe they have more to loſe; ſo likewiſe voluptuous perſons, are more fearful of Death, <pb n="38" facs="tcp:47453:26"/>then thoſe that are more temperate, becauſe by voluptuouſneſs they have diſ-joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and weakned their ſpirits. So young men many times are more fearful of Death,
<note place="margin">Judg 8.20.</note> then thoſe that are old, as we ſee in the ſtory, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Jether the ſonne of Gideon,</hi> when he ſhould have killed <hi>Zeba,</hi> and <hi>Zalmunna,</hi> the Text ſaith, <hi>He was afraid becauſe he was a young man;</hi> but <hi>Gideon,</hi> that was elder did it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, as a man better accuſtomed, and experienced with obſervations of changes, and varieties of accidents amongſt men.</p>
               <p>We ſhall ſee the ſervants of God themſelves have diſcovered this weakneſs of ſpirit, ſpecially upon ſudden apprehenſions of things. <hi>Abraham</hi> upon the ſudden and violent apprehenſion of Death,
<note place="margin">Gen. 201</note> was put to a ſinful ſhift: <hi>I thought</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the fear of God is not in this place, and they will ſlay me for my wives ſake, therefore I ſaid this is my ſiſter.</hi> So <hi>Samuel,</hi> when God ſent him to anoynt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam 16.</note> he diſcovered this weakneſs, <hi>If Saul ſhould know what I am a doing, he will ſlay me;</hi> therefore he deſired to have ſome other meſſage, under the colour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he might put <hi>Saul</hi> off. So <hi>Peter</hi> out of a ſudden apprehenſion of death, and fear of it, he denyed his Maſter: This weakneſs of ſpirit is in man natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Further, there is another thing that cauſeth this natural fear, and that is, the unacquaintedneſs men have with Death, there is ſomewhat in this matter, that is ſtrange to men; notwithſtanding they hear, and ſee many die before them daily, they hear things ſpoken of by the Miniſter, and they read the Scripture, &amp; many excellent comforts, but who hath ſeen theſe? what becometh of theſe men? they ſee Death the ſtrict Porter of the world, let men out of the earth, but he locks the door of the Grave upon them, and none cometh back again to tell what is done <hi>in that place of ſilence,</hi> to tell what is become of men, when they are in the Grave, how they ſpeed in that world of ſouls; there is no man returneth from the dead to report theſe things to them. Now this affecteth the natural man, nay all men naturally are affected with the fearful apprehenſion of death, becauſe they <hi>know not what will come after,</hi> as the natural man ſpeaks in Eccleſiaſtes. When <hi>Joram</hi> ſet out a watch-man to ſee what was abroad, and ſpied an army coming, he ſent a ſervant, but <hi>Jehu</hi> biddeth <hi>him go behind him,</hi> he ſendeth another, and <hi>he goeth behind him</hi> ſtill: ſaith he, <hi>I ſee the men go but they come not back:</hi> the Text ſaith, <hi>he was afraid. Make ready the Chariot,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joram;</hi> If this be the iſſue that men go, but never come back again, it is high time to look about us. Certainly (beloved) ſuch are the apprehenſions of death: We ſee men (ſaith the natural man) go down to the Grave, and not come back again, we ſee that a man ceaſeth to be, and to do thoſe actions that we do, when we are upon the earth, therefore let us conſider the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more ſeriouſly. When the <hi>Captain of the fifty,</hi> that came to the <hi>Mount</hi> to <hi>Elijah,</hi> ſaw the two former <hi>Captaines,</hi> and their <hi>companies</hi> conſumed, ſaw that they were all dead, that they ceaſed to be, but he ſaw not what became of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, therefore he cometh with fear to the Prophet, and intreateth him that <hi>his life might be precious in his ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All ſtrange things we know affect men, and every thing, as it is more ſtrange; ſo it more affecteth man naturally: Let there but come a beaſt out of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, aſſoon as ever he cometh unto a man and ſeeth him, he flieth from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not uſed to the ſight of man, it is ſtrange to him; but now take a beaſt that is brought up in the paſture, in the field, he will come to a man without fear, becauſe he is uſed to the ſight of him. So it is here: Death is apprehended as a ſtrange thing, as a thing that a man never knew by experience; Men have ſeen thus much, that people have died, but they never heard of any that came back again to tell them how it fared with them after death. This (I ſay) that men ſhould go to the <hi>place of ſilence</hi> and have all matters huſhed, all things kept ſecret down there, there cometh no report thence, this affecteth men with fear.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the natural cauſes.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Inward cauſes ſinful.</note> there are other cauſes within, that affect men with the fear of death, and thoſe are ſinful cauſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. The want of the fear of God.</note> the want of the fear of God, and as this is leſſe, ſo the <hi>fear of death</hi> is more; <pb n="39" facs="tcp:47453:26"/>Therefore we ſhall find that wicked men that caſt off the fear of God in their lives, they are ſlaviſhly <hi>held under the fear of death,</hi> this you ſhall ſee in thoſe examples of <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> a man that ſet himſelf with a high hand againſt God, went on in a contemptuous courſe againſt God, and prophaned the <hi>holy veſſels,</hi> when there was <hi>a hand writing upon the wall,</hi> ſome terrible thing preſented to him, his <hi>knees ſmote together,</hi> he could not hold his joynts ſtill: And ſo <hi>Felix,</hi> a man that lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fear of God, when he <hi>heard of judgment,</hi> and other things; the text ſaith, <hi>he trembled;</hi> and ſo likewiſe <hi>Cain,</hi> and divers others, I need not ſtand on it.</p>
               <p>It was one of the Judgments threatned in part,
<note place="margin">Deut. 28.65, 66, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>Becauſe thou doſt not fear the the Lord thy God, therefore whereſoever thou goeſt, thou ſhalt find no eaſe, neither ſhall the ſole of thy foot have any rest, but the Lord ſhall give thee a trembling heart, and thy life ſhall hang in doubt before thee,</hi> (that is, thou ſhalt be in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fear of death) <hi>and thou ſhalt fear day and night, and ſhall have none aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thy life; in the Morning thou ſhalt ſay, would God it were Even, and at even thou ſhalt ſay, would God it were morning, becauſe of the fear of thine heart wherewith thou ſhalt fear; and for the ſight of thine eyes which thou ſhalt ſee.</hi> This is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. In ordinate love of the world.</note> another thing is this, when mens hearts are too much glued to the world, and mark it, according as there is worldly affections, and worldly-mindedneſs in the the hearts of Gods ſervants, ſo the feare of Death is more in them: according to the ſtrength of the one, is the fear of the other. What is it that diſquieteth men ordinarily, and makes them that they cannot think of Death with comfort, but this? now they muſt loſe their company, part with all their freinds when they die once.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 38.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> complained of that, <hi>I ſhall ſee man no more</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the inhabitants of the world.</hi> This I ſay, is that that affecteth the heart exceedingly, that they muſt loſe all their freinds, ſpecially when husband and wife muſt part, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children muſt part, and familiar and deare acquaintance muſt part, this cauſeth the <hi>fear of death,</hi> becauſe the heart is too much ſet upon the creature. So likewiſe worldly buſineſs, when a man loveth much employment, much buſineſs, he cannot abide to think of death, Why ſo? becauſe <hi>all work, all enterpriſes ceaſe in the grave,</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith) A man hath neither the works of his hands, nor the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes of his head in the grave, all actions ceaſe, both of the mind and body there. So when a mans heart is ſet upon pleaſures below, <hi>there is neither love nor hatred in the grave</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) That is,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ 9.</note> thoſe things that affected the heart that men love, they ceaſe there, all his pleaſures and comforts are gone. So if a man love honour, and applauſe amongſt men, it ceaſeth in the grave, all honour there is laid in the duſt, <hi>contempt is caſt upon Princes:</hi> this is that that affecteth men exceedingly, that they ſhall loſe their honours and pleaſures, and acquaintance, and buſineſs, and all when they come to the grave, and that becauſe mens hearts are ſet too much upon theſe things. That is the ſecond reaſon.</p>
               <p>There is a third thing,
<note place="margin">3. Want of the aſſurance of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</note> which is a ſinful cauſe of this fear of Death, and that is the want of Aſſurance. There be two things that a man not being aſſured of, makes him fear Death; and theſe may be in the children of God, and as they are more in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, ſo the <hi>fear of death</hi> is more in them.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, when they are not aſſured of reconciliation with God, that God is at peace with them, pleaſed with them in Chriſt. The want of this aſſurance makes death fearful, for now they look upon Death, as a Sergeant, as a Jaylor; either it is a Sergeant to take them off their preſent comforrs, or as a Jaylor to hold them under thoſe bonds and fetters, that they would fain eſcape: Now when a man looks upon Death either way, it is terrible. As a Sergeant; ſo the rich man in the Goſpel, <hi>This night they ſhall fetch thy ſoul from thee:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note> they ſhall come to thee as a Sergeant to a Debtour, to require a debt, they ſhall require thy ſoul of thee; Now, we all know, that a man that is in debt, and either hath not to pay, or is unwilling to part with that he hath, ſuch a man cannot indure the ſight of a Sergeant above all men, becauſe he cometh to fetch that from him, that he would not part with. Or if he look upon Death as a Jaylor,
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> ſo Chriſt ſaith; <hi>Agree with thy adverſary quickly, leſt he deliver thee to the Judg, and he give thee to the Jaylor,</hi> and then he <pb n="40" facs="tcp:47453:27"/>holdeth thee <hi>in priſon from whence thou ſhalt not go out, till thou haſt paid the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing.</hi> Now when a man looks on Death as a Jaylor, that holdeth all in the grave, till the great Judg of heaven and earth calleth for them, at the generall day of Aſſizes, that great day of appearance, when all the world ſhall be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and every priſon ſhall give up their priſoners, <hi>The ſea and the grave ſhall give up their dead.</hi> I ſay, when a man ſtandeth thus as unreconciled to God, or at leaſt, as one that doth not apprehend this reconciliation, is not perſwaded of this, that God is reconciled to him, it is no marvel if Death be terrible to him. Therefore in the ſixth of the Revelation;
<note place="margin">Rev 6.</note> 
                  <hi>The Kings and Captains, and the great and mighty men, they cryed to the mountains to fall upon them, and to hide them, from the preſence of the Lamb;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 33.14.</note> becauſe the great day of wrath was come, and who could ſtand.</hi> So we ſee in 33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14. there is crying out concerning the coming of God, <hi>the ſinners in Sion, the hypocrites are afraid,</hi> what is their fear! <hi>who ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings? and who ſhall remain with couſuming fire?</hi> when they ſhall ſee nothing but terrour and wrath in God, fire and conſumption, when they ſee nothing but ſuch terrible things, then feare cometh upon them. Now mark, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites ſtand all together unreconciled, and therefore it is no marvel if they be afraid: and the Saints of God, ſo farre as they are defective in the aſſurance of Gods love, ſo farre they conceive themſelves in the ſtate of Hypocrites, and therefore they are ſo full of fears.</p>
               <p>Again, a ſecond thing that they ſtand unreſolved of, is concerning the future eſtates of their ſouls and bodies after death, they are not ſure of this, that there is a better condition afterwards: this is that great queſtion, <hi>Whither go we?</hi> I go now out of the body, and whither then? I go out of the world, and whither then? I am going out of the company of men, and whither then? ſhall I go to Angels and Saints, or to divels? ſhall I go to Heaven or to Hell? ſhall I have a beeing or not, in miſery or in happineſs? They know not what ſhall become of them, they are unreſolved of this point, of their own ſtate to come, whether they ſhall be in happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or horrour after death, and therefore Death is terrible. You have the point ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; I will anſwer an objection or two, and then come to the uſe.</p>
               <p>It may be objected:
<note place="margin">Object.</note> It ſeemeth the ſervants of God are not <hi>kept under the fear of death:</hi> all thoſe that are in the ſtate of grace, have faith; faith, that ſpendeth theſe fears, and therefore ſince they are in the ſtate of beleevers, how can they be <hi>held under the fear of death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer briefly;
<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> there is faith in all the children of God that are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, but we muſt know that Faith is conſiderable two wayes, firſt as it is in conflict, and ſecondly as it is out of conflict. Now the Faith of Gods ſervants in conflict, ſo ſometime it is in conflict with fear, and ſadneſs of ſpirit; <hi>Why art thou caſt down oh my ſoul?
<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.</note> why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> &amp;c. Sometime it is in conflict with reaſon and ſenſe; thus the people of Iſrael, when they came into the Wilderneſs;
<note place="margin">Exod. 14 11.</note> they looked for nothing but dying, and deſtruction of nature (for ſenſe preſented it to them,) therefore ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> (which is the voice of faith) <hi>Stand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of God,</hi> &amp;c. Now in this conflict the ſucceſs is doubtful, ſometime (as it was between <hi>Amalek</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> fighting together) <hi>Amalek</hi> prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Iſrael had the worſt: ſometime Iſrael prevailed, and <hi>Amalek</hi> had the worſt, ſo ſomtime, Faith prevaileth againſt ſenſe, and thoſe fears that ariſe from ſenſe, and ſometime again carnal fears, and Senſe prevaileth againſt Faith; now accordingly are thoſe effects in the hearts of Gods children.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, ſometime Faith is out of conflict, it now triumpheth in aſſurance, it is come now to full aſſurance of Faith, as it is called in the Scripture, and then there is nothing ſo comfortable,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 23.</note> and deſirable as death it ſelf to the ſervants of God. So we ſee <hi>David</hi> in the 23. Pſal. <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death I will fear none ill, for thou Lord art with me:</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> triumpheth over all things, <hi>Nothing ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt, neither principalities nor powers, nor life, nor death, nor things to come;</hi> nothing ſhall do it, the Apoſtles faith now was out of conflict, it had got the field, the day of Senſe, and now he looks on Death with comfort. So that I ſay in that meaſure that Faith works, in that meaſure, <hi>fear of death</hi> ceaſeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:47453:27"/>
Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note> it may be objected. But we ſee the ſervants of God are ſaid <hi>to love the appearance of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid <hi>to deſire to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and to be with Chriſt;</hi> How can theſe ſtand with the <hi>fear of death,</hi> under which Gods ſervants <hi>are held?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer briefly.
<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Gods ſervants muſt be conſidered in their deſires two waies. Firſt, in their general deſires; Secondly, in a particular ſtate wherein they are. In their general courſe, their deſire is moſt for the <hi>appearing of Chriſt,</hi> they moſt deſire to be with him as <hi>beſt for them:</hi> but take them in ſome particular ſtate wherein they are leſs provided, and leſs fitted and prepared, then, they may be at a ſtand in their deſires, they may have the fear of death in them. As a wife, her general deſire is for nothing ſo much as for the preſence of her husband, yet ſhe may be under ſome particular unfitneſs, there may be ſomething or other in the way, that ſhe would not have him come in at that inſtant, though her deſire be for nothing ſo much as for his company. So it may be the caſe of the ſervants of God, they may ſay ſomtimes, <hi>Lord ſpare me a little before I go hence,</hi> to ſtrengthen my faith, to perfect my repentance and holineſs, to do ſome particular work, and the like. <hi>David</hi> conſidered this, that there was ſomething that he might doe that he had not done, and that he would faine doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went: and ſo <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the reſt of the ſervants of God. The point is clear. I come to the Application.</p>
               <p>It ſhall be a word of exhortation (to cut of other uſes) and that is this.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> For exorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To ſtir up the ſervants of God, that if they be diſpoſed to diſtempers <hi>under which they are held,</hi> that they are afraid to die, that therefore they labour by all good meanes, to ſhake off <hi>the feare of death.</hi> Why? Conſider and note well thoſe two things that are in the Text.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this,
<note place="margin">To be under the fear of death an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable eſtate.</note> that it is an uncomfortable ſtate to be <hi>held under the feare of Death,</hi> you ſee it is called <hi>a Bondage</hi> here, and that is enough to ſhow the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortableneſs of it, he ſaith, by the <hi>feare of death, they were held in bondage all their life long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the fear of Death is a bondage principally in theſe two reſpects,
<note place="margin">The fear of death a bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in two reſpects.</note> firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is with them, as it is with a Bond-ſlave. A Bond-ſlave is afraid to looke on him that hath the command of him, he apprehendeth him as no freind, therefore he doth not love to looke on him: ſo it is in this caſe, when a man lookes upon Death as a thing that is no freind to him, he cannot abide to look on him, every thought of Death, is a preſenting of death to him, and it is a miſerable bondage, when a man cannot preſent Death to himſelf without fear.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2.</note> there is this in it that makes it a bondage, it holdeth downe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man. A bond-ſlave (you know) is bound with fetters and chaines in his captivity, ſo that he hath neither freedome of ſpirit, nor freedome of action: So it is with a man that is <hi>held under the fear of death,</hi> he cannot doe what he would, he cannot rejoyce in God; he cannot delight in the apprehenſion of glory to come, he cannot entertain a thought of parting with things preſent, with that ſecurity, and comfort of heart, that he ſhould doe, and all becauſe this fear, (as the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) bindeth his hands and his feet, and keepeth him in bondage. This is the firſt thing, the fear of death, to be held under it, it is an uncomfortable ſtate.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">It is poſſible to be freed from the fear of death.</note> as it is uncomfortable, ſo it is poſſible that the ſervants of God, may be free from theſe fears under which they are held. We ſee the text ſheweth it, <hi>Chriſt came for this end, that having deſtroyed him that hath the power of death, that is the devil, he might deliver thoſe, that for fear of death were held under bondage.</hi> Did Chriſt come for this end? then it is poſſible to be had, for certainly Chriſt would not loſe his end he came for: this was his end, not only to deliver them from eternal death but alſo from the fear of temporal death; It is poſſible therefore; The ſervants of God have found it, and therefore you ſhall ſee them brought in inſulting, and triumphing, and glorying over Death; <hi>Oh death, where is thy ſting? Oh Grave, where is thy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thanks be to God that hath given us victory, through Chriſt our Lord:</hi> When they looked upon Death through Chriſt, they looked on it without this fear, the ſting and power is took out, the very nature of it is changed, and it is made now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way beneficial. I ſay it is poſſible, for we are regenerate, and begotten again <pb n="42" facs="tcp:47453:28"/>to a lively hope, to an inheritance immortal and undefiled, and in what meaſure the hope of heaven is in the heart of man, in that meaſure the <hi>fear of death</hi> falleth in that heart, now it is poſſible that we may attain this fulneſs of hope, and therefore it is poſſible that we may be freed quite from the fear of Death.</p>
               <p>This may ſuffice by way of motive. A word or two by way of direction. If this be poſſible to be had, how ſhall the ſervants of God get it? you ſee ſome of Gods ſervants <hi>are held under the fear of death, and that all their life long;</hi> how ſhall we be freed from this fear?</p>
               <p>I ſhould now orderly take up the particulars laid down as cauſes,
<note place="margin">Means to be freed from the fear of death.</note> and ſhew that by theſe it is cured: as for inſtance. Doth God do this for this end, that he may humble a man? then the more humble thou art, the leſs thou ſhalt be in the fear of Death, for God layeth theſe fears upon men to humble them, therefore labour for perfect humiliation,
<note place="margin">1. Humility.</note> and thou ſhalt perfectly rid theſe fears out of thy heart: as we ſee plainly, the ſervants of God, the more humble they have grown, the leſs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful they have been of life, and the leſs fearful of Death: And ſo thoſe ſervants of God that have been brought to deny themſelves, and to renounce all their worldly expectation and advancements, they have alwaies been ready to die. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was grown humble, and the Lord had prevailed upon him, kept down his ſpirit from <hi>being exalted above meaſure,</hi> and now (faith he) <hi>my life is not dear to me,</hi> he was content to lay down his life and all when he was humbled. Beloved, pride in ſome outward excellencies or other, ſetteth a man above his place, therefore when a man is took off from all that puffs up the ſpirit of a man, he will be content, to lay down any of thoſe things, even life it ſelfe if need be.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly;
<note place="margin">2. Faith.</note> Doth God do it to ſtrengthen faith in a man? then the more thou ſtrengtheneſt faith, the more thou ſhalt be freed from theſe fears; you know faith looks upon Chriſt as the proper object of it, and the more a man intereſteth himſelf in Chriſt, the more by Chriſt, he is freed from the fear of Death, Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the Grave and from Death, and therefore when by faith he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt, and through him upon Death; he looks upon that, as a thing made, inſtead of poiſon a medicine; inſtead of a deſtroyer, a Saviour and deliverer, as a means to free him from the bondage of ſin and miſery and afflictions, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly;
<note place="margin">3. watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> Doth God do this, that he may make men more holy and watchful in their courſe? then certainly the more thou canſt purge out thy ſin in the courſe of thy life, the leſs thou ſhalt fear death. <hi>The ſting of Death is ſin,</hi> then if thou wilt have Death comfortable, let thy life be conformable to Gods rule and word, or elſe every ſin will preſent it ſelfe in death before thee, ſpecially thoſe ſins, thou alloweſt thy ſelf in, will make Death as bitter as Hell.</p>
               <p>Fourthly;
<note place="margin">4. Preparation.</note> Doth God do it for this end, that he may make thee better prepared for death? Then the more thou art prepared for Death beforehand, the leſs thou ſhalt fear it, when it cometh upon thee, it will not come as a ſtranger, but thou wilt be ready to receive it, as one with whom thou art acquainted already.</p>
               <p>It is a great matter if men could learn this wiſdome <hi>to die daily;</hi> that is, be every day imployed, as dying daily: I mean for the manner of your carriage, not for the matter, for the ſubſtance of the duty. If a man were ſure to die this day he would lay aſide all buſineſs, and ſet himſelf to be prepared for judgment, and would lay aſide the uſe of any other comforts and delights. But this is not the meaning, but this, that we carry our ſelves in buſineſs every day, as if death ſhould ſeize upon us in that buſineſs, that we <hi>might be found well-doing;</hi> that is, when a man followeth his earthly buſineſs with a heavenly mind, when he keepeth to the rule of righteouſneſs, and truth in his ordinary calling, when he is doing, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving good in his company, when he uſeth his pleaſures and recreations, as the whet-ſtone to the Sithe, to make him fitter for God; I ſay, when thus we do things to a right end, and in a right manner; if Death now ſhould ſeize upon us in ſuch an action, it ſhould find us well-doing: And this is that we perſwade you to, if you would have death comfortable, and not tertible, be ſo imployed, as that your actions may be good, both for matter and forme, that you are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, becauſe Death may ſtricke you in ſuch an action. But I cannot ſtand on theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47453:28"/>
Again,
<note place="margin">5. Right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Death.</note> for the cauſes in our ſelves; If you would be freed from the terrours of Death, then rectifie your apprehenſions and opinions of Death, think of it as it is, as it is I ſay to beleevers, to thoſe that are in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is not the deſtruction of nature, and ſo a natural Ill, as you account it; It is rather a cure of nature; for aſſoon as ever we live, we are dying, and all our life, it is but a living death, a continual decaying and dying. Now when death cometh, it putteth an end to all the decayes of nature, and ſetteth all right again. It is but a ſleep, and ſleep it is not a deſtruction, but a help of the body, and that which inableth to vigour and ſtrength, and fitneſſe to action.</p>
               <p>Again, it is not the diſtruction of any part of a man, the body it ſelf is not deſtroyed: indeed it is in the Grave, but it is in the grave, as in a bed of peace, <hi>They ſhall come and reſt in their beds</hi> (ſaith the Prophet;) The grave is but as a bed wherein the body lies aſleep, and no man (you know) is troubled with fear that he goeth to bed. The grave is but as Gods cheſt to keep in all his Treaſure, whereof the bodies of his ſervants are a part, precious to him, even in the grave, in death, <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints;</hi> and God will open this Cabinet, and the Cheſt of the Grave, in the great day of the Reſurrection, and bring the body out again, and then it ſhall be as good as ever it was; nay, I ſay not only as good, but much better too, for our <hi>vile bodies ſhall be made like the glorious body of Chriſt. Phil</hi> 3.
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> No man when he goeth to bed, thinks much to have his old cloathes taken off, that they may be mended, and made better againſt morning. When we ſleep in the Grave, it is no more but this, the garment of the ſoul, the body, the old apparel, that is taken off, that it may be made better, and a more glorious body, this is all, we loſe nothing by it, but our eſtates, even our bodily eſtate is bettered by it.</p>
               <p>And for the Soul, Death doth not deſtroy that neither, for know this, the ſoul liveth for ever, the <hi>bodie</hi> indeed <hi>returneth to the Earth as it was,</hi> but <hi>the ſoul returneth to God that gave it;</hi> The ſoul I ſay liveth, that is the thing that Chriſt himſelf proveth in 22. Mat. <hi>Abraham</hi> is alive, why ſo? <hi>for God is not the God of the dead, but of the living;</hi> for God ſaid, <hi>I am the God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. How can this be, that God is the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet he is dead? Indeed he is dead, if we looke to the ſeparation of the ſoul and body, in the ceſſation of bodily actions; but if we looke to the better part of <hi>Abraham,</hi> his ſoul, that continueth, the everliving God hath made an everlaſting Covenant with him, and therefore he dieth not.</p>
               <p>Again it is not only, not the deſtruction of nature, but not of your actions neither, Death doth not deſtroy them neither; Indeed there is a ceſſation of bodily actions, but it is, that the body may have better ſtrength, and be the fitter inſtrument of holineſs after: But for thoſe actions of the ſoul, that depend not upon the body; they are as perfectly done, when we are dead, as when we are alive, and better too, When a man liveth upon the earth (you ſee,) his ſoul is much hindered by the body; A diſtempered ſick crazie body, or a full well-fed body, is a hinderance to the ſoul, becauſe of that tie that is between the body, and the ſoul, and the ſpirit: ſo there is a ſimpathy, the ſoul is affected ſomewhat in this ſenſe. But it is not ſo then, the ſoul ſhall be looſed from the body, and ſo freer for ſpiritual actions then now it is. <hi>The ſouls under the Altar,</hi> they crie, <hi>How long Lord, holy and juſt, wilt thou not revenge our bloud upon them that are upon the earth?</hi> The ſouls of Gods ſervants you ſee then are glorified, when they are out of the body, and therefore ſhall glorifie God more prefectly, and enjoy God more freely and fully, then now while their ſouls are in theſe mortal bodies. And at that very inſtant, when the ſoul of Cods ſervant is carried out of the body to heaven, it more perfectly injoyeth Chriſt, and is more ſenſible, and more fit to anſwer the love of Chriſt to him, then ever when it was in the body. So then here is a ceſſation of baſer actions and imployments, to give place to more noble, and heavenly, and excellent actions, wherein the ſoul ſhall be employed in heaven. There is then no loſſe of actions neither.</p>
               <p>Again, there is no loſſe of company. This is a thing that troubleth men, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife to part, friends to part. But we loſe no company by death, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <pb n="44" facs="tcp:47453:29"/>we loſe the company of men, that we cannot aſſure ourſelves friends indeed: for of all the friends we ſpeak of in the main point, when they come to be tryed, there are few to be found to be friends: But then, we go to them whoſe love is perfect, than you may be ſure of, and have the truth of their love. Again, how little comfort, nay how little have you company with thoſe friends you deſire? Is not much part of our life ſpent without any ſight of our friends? Is not half of it ſpent in ſleep in the night? and the other half in buſineſſe and pleaſure? Alas! how little time have we to enjoy our friends we reſt on? But then, we ſhall perfectly enjoy them, when there ſhall be no need of ſleep, when there ſhall be perfection of love, and freedom from diſtraction and imployment, when the ſervants of God ſhall fully, and freely, and ſweetly, and comfortably enjoy one the other. <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the meaneſt of the Saints, ſhall meet in the expreſſion of love, in ſuch a perfection as we cannot ſpeak of. And this is certain, you ſhall go to many. <hi>Who can tell the dvſt of Jacob?</hi> Now you have ſome one, or two, or three, or a few men or women that you account friends, and dote much upon, but then you ſhall have ennumerable company, a world of friends of men and women, multitudes, they cannot be numbred, they are as the ſtars of heaven for number. I ſay there is no loſſe of company by this means.</p>
               <p>Again, you ſhall loſe no pleaſures by death, it may be you ſhall loſe ſome few ſenſual bruitiſh pleaſures, a few mixed, corrupt pleaſures, pleaſures that have the mixture of ſorrow and fear in them, that imbitters them to the ſoul of a man, but it ſhall not be ſo then: you ſhall be freed from imperfect pleaſures, and have perfect ones at Gods right hand for evermore, pure pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Again, you loſe no neceſſary convenience neither, the rich man loſeth no riches by death; he loſeth his money, doth he loſe his riches therefore? No; The Angels are rich, but they have no money; the Saints are rich, they want nothing, but they have no money. It may be thou loſeſt a child, thou ſhalt find a Father; it may be thou loſeſt a weak friend; that loveth not long, or it may be not ſo truly as thou thinkeſt he doth; and thou findeſt friends that are many and perfect, and pure in their love, that love with a perfect heart; And what then are all thoſe loſſes, when you enjoy that which ſhall make the ſoul happy for ever?</p>
               <p>Thus I ſay you ſhall rectifie your opinions concerning Death, look upon it aright, have true apprehenſions of it.</p>
               <p>Get an intreſt in Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Aſſurance of Gods favour.</note> and look on death through him, get faith, and then all theſe things that I have ſpoken ſhall be your advantage, ſo the Apoſtle concludeth, <hi>Chriſt is to us in life and in death advantage;</hi> If we live he is gain to us in life, and if we die, he is advantage to us in death. And death is reckoned amongſt the ſpecial favours and priviledges Chriſt hath given to his Church;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.23</note> 
                  <hi>All are yours,</hi> what all? <hi>life and death, things preſent, and things to come; all are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> So we ſee that Death is amongſt the priviledges that Chriſt hath given his Church, therefore rectifie your opinions concerning Death, make good that I ſpake before, and you ſhall find this good that I now ſpeak.</p>
               <p>And for the laſt, the unacquaintance with Death: let not that trouble you, none come from the dead to tell you what is done there, but look on the ſervants of God before, and when they die, and you ſhall find enough how they apprehended Death, when they have looked on it in the glaſſe of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Look upon them before death, <hi>Jacob</hi> being to cloſe up his dayes with bleſſing of his children; <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have maited for thy ſalvation.</hi> He looked upon Death through Chriſt, the Saviour of the world? that he ſhould be ſaved by him: and though it be true that there is a further meaning for the Tribes in thoſe words of <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet this was proper to <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf, he looked upon Death now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as that that he was delivered from, and ſet into that freedom purchaſed by Chriſt. So old <hi>Simeon, Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy word, for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation; Jacoh</hi> accounted it his ſalvation; old <hi>Simeon,</hi> a departure from a worſe place to a better, from worſe company and comforts to a better; A change for the better ſtill, and a departing in peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:47453:29"/>
Again ſecondly, look on the ſervants of God in death, ſee what they have ſaid too: <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a man that was upright in heart, he <hi>went to the grave in peace,</hi> he was <hi>gathered to his fathers in peace, that he ſhould not ſee the evill that ſhould come upon his people:</hi> here is all: it was but a peaceable taking of him away from a more troubelous condition if he had lived longer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Beloved, he died in war, yet it is ſaid he was <hi>gathered in peace;</hi> he had inward peace with God, though he failed in that particular action.
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.4.</note> And the Apoſtle in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. <hi>This is our deſire that we may be clothed upon, not that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality may be ſwallowed up of life.</hi> A ſtrange ſpeech, he counteth death life to him, he counteth the death of this life, to be the death of mortality, by laying <hi>aſide this earthly tabernacle</hi> (as he ſaid in the firſt verſe) <hi>mortality is ſwallowed up of life:</hi> And therefore you give wrong names to things, for while you live, you die, becauſe your life it is a dying condition, and while you die, you live, becauſe then the ceſſation of life it is as the river <hi>Jordan</hi> to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> no more but a paſſage to <hi>Canaan,</hi> not a floud to drown them; ſo it is with the ſervants of God, death is but a paſſage to heaven, it is not deſtructive to them.</p>
               <p>So that if men did but rectifie their opinions of Death (as I told you before) when their hearts are right ſet, when they are humbled, and not lifted up with worldly things, when their faith is ſtrengthned, and ſetled in them, when they are made watchful in a holy courſe, looking for Death, when they are eſtabliſhed with the aſſurance of Gods favour, then I ſay they may find that all theſe natural fears of death were upon miſtake, they did not rightly apprehend the thing. Other things I ſhould have added, but I am loth to hold you too long.</p>
               <p>A word for the occaſion; and ſo I will conclude: the departure of our Siſter here was the occaſion, as of this meeting here, ſo of this Text in particular. She gave good evidence to thoſe that knew her more inwardly, that ſhe was in Chriſt, that the was <hi>delivered not onely from eternal death, but from fear of tempor all death too.</hi> It pleaſed God to exerciſe her a great while under the <hi>fear of death,</hi> the apprehenſion of it was of ſome terrour to her, but nevertheleſſe when God called her to it indeed, then the <hi>fear of death</hi> was hid from her, and Chriſt then applied the fruit of his death, in <hi>freeing</hi> her from thoſe fears. She was not freed from them out of a Stoycal Appethy, or want of natural affection and paſſion, but out of a ſpiritual and faithful application of Chriſt to her ſelfe upon good grounds. She looked upon God as her Father, and much delighted to expreſſe her apprehenſion of him under that notion, and ſhe very often manifeſted her rejoycing in that intereſt ſhe had in God, as his child: no marvel then if the <hi>fear of death</hi> were taken away: we ſee here in the text, that <hi>they are children that are delivered from the fear of death.</hi> When we are in the ſtate of Gods children by adoption and grace, then there is rather a deſire, then a fear of death: It is but as our Fathers <hi>white Horſe,</hi> ſo it is called in the Revelation. A child at ſchool, when he ſeeth one riding poſt through the ſtreets, as if he would run over him, or tread upon him, he cryeth out: But if he ſees that it is his fathers man ſent to bring him from ſchool to his Fathers houſe, all his fear is paſt, and he laugheth and rejoyceth. So when we are the ſons and daughters of God by adoption, we apprehend Death as our Fathers pale Horſe, ſent by him to bring us, from a place of priſon on earth; home to our Fathers houſe, a place of liberty in heaven; So it was with her.</p>
               <p>She looked upon Chriſt as her Husband, and though ſhe left a husband upon earth, yet (it was her owne expreſſion) <hi>ſhe was to go to her Husband in heaven, which was farre better for her.</hi> And therefore (I ſay) having theſe apprehenſions of God as her Father, and that ſhe was adopted to the eſtate of a child by grace, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Chriſt as her husband, no marvel ſhe was freed from the fear of Death. And that theſe were upon good grounds, thoſe that knew her courſe beſt, knew that ſhe expreſſed it by her abundant care to pleaſe God, by her deſire to ſerve God, by her endeavour to mortifie and ſubdue ill in her ſelfe, by her growth in grace in her latter times, theſe good evidences did ſhew that it was not a raſh and groundleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, but a true and real apprehenſion of God and Chriſt that freed her from this <hi>Fear of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:47453:30"/>
Beloved, many times the life of Gods ſervants is uncomfortable to them, becauſe (for ſome of thoſe reaſons I have ſpoken of before) they are afraid of Death, and they apprehend it not with comfort, and this they doe, becauſe they ſee not the intereſt they have in better comforts then Death can take from them; I have the rather therefore ſpoke this of her, that you may take notice of it, and apply it to your ſelves.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, make this uſe of all, to grow more humble, and watchful, and holy, to ſtrengthen faith more, and by dying daily to prepare more for Death: For faith is the rectified apprehenſion of things: Death it is not ſo fearful as you think it is, you loſe not ſo much as you think you loſe. Nay again, becauſe this trouble, and this fear diſhonoureth God, therefore when God calleth us to Death, he hideth theſe fears from us, as he did from this ſervant of Chriſt at this time before us; though ſhe were fearful before, yet ſhe was exceeding comfortable all the time, when the apprehenſion of Death approached upon her. So it ſhall be with thee, if thou be careful to uſe the means to prepare for Death: mind thou the dutie that God enjoyneth thee in thy life, and leave the event and iſſue to him; either he will glorifie himſelf by thy fears, or elſe he will glorifie himſelf by delivering thee from thy fears.</p>

                  <hi>Patience</hi> (in a word) <hi>it is a grace or fruit of Gods ſpirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Definition of Patience</note> 
                  <hi>whereby the heart of a beleever willingly ſubmiteth it ſelf to the will of God in all afflictions, and changes in this life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, <hi>it is a work or fruit of Gods ſpirit.</hi> In reſpect of this work, the efficient is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<note place="margin">Rom. 15.5. Gal. 5.22.</note> 
                  <hi>The God of Patience</hi> and <hi>long ſuffering</hi> (which is the ſame with <hi>Patience</hi>) is made a <hi>fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of this, <hi>is the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The act of this <hi>Patience,</hi> is <hi>to ſubmit a mans ſelf willingly to God in afflictions:</hi> I ſay <hi>willingly,</hi> for there is a ſubmiſſion which is by force; when God ſubjects a man to himſelfe, not by a gratious and ſweet inclining of the will, but by a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ſubduing of the perſon.</p>
               <p>Now, when I ſay there is ſuch a <hi>willing ſubmiſſion to God in afflictions;</hi> the meaning is thus; That there may be in a believer, in a child of God, a <hi>Velietie,</hi> an inclination of the will, a natural deſire to be freed from Afflictions, yet nevertheleſs there is in him that willingneſs that is here the <hi>Patience</hi> of a Chriſtian. There may be a willingneſs, &amp; an unwllingneſs in one and the ſame perſon ariſing from divers principles. In every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſoul, there is is a principle of nature, and a principle of grate, (I ſpeak not now of corrupt nature, but of pure nature, for we may ſo ſpeak.) There is a deſire that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from nature, and that tendeth to the conſervation of a mans beeing, and to the conſervation of a man in all the comforts, and contentments of his beeing: This is and may be in a child of God. But then it is overſwayed by grace, which makes a man now reſign up this will of his to Gods hand, to be content (againſt his own natural deſires,) to be diſpoſed of according to Gods will. This we may ſee in our Lord and Saviour: <hi>Father</hi> (faith he) <hi>if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me.</hi> Hear is a deſire to keep,
<note place="margin">Mat. 25</note> not onely in his natural beeing, but to keep in the comfort of nature and life: And this is lawful and a good deſire; for theſe affections, are the works of God upon the ſoul of man. The will of man moveth naturally by theſe affections, theſe deſires they are the fruits of nature, and ſo the works of God in nature, and therefore not ſimply to be blamed. But now that which keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them within compaſs, is an over-ruling work of grace, whereby the creature is made to acknowledge his diſtance from the Creatour, and that ſubjection he oweth to God, as the ſoveraign Lord of nature, and of all creatures. And in this ſenſe our Saviour Chriſt doth check his natural deſires; <hi>if it be poſſible let this cup paſs from me, nevertheleſs, not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> faith he. So here is a work of grace, ordering and over-ruling nature, that it might not exceed that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the creature, and thoſe deſires that ſhould be in nature.</p>
               <p>So then you ſee what kind of willingneſs we mean, ſuch a kind of willingneſs, as in the iſſue and cloſe reſteth in Gods will.</p>
               <p>The object of this <hi>Patience</hi> is <hi>Afflictions, and the changes of this life.</hi> Affliction is properly any thing that is grievous to a mans ſenſe, any thing that croſſeth a mans will. There are ſome things that indeed are Afflictions, but not to this or that perſon, becauſe he is not ſenſible of them, or becauſe he is not carried with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſires againſt them: But when a man is croſt in his will, that is an affliction to him; but ſpecially when this is ſet on him with a change, when God brings, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>changes upon him,</hi> when a man is in another turning and courſe of life, this is an affliction indeed. A man that hath taſted the ſweetneſs of proſperity now to be left in affliction, this was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, and this is ſpecially the object of <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. You have heard of the Patience of Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how did <hi>Jobs Patience</hi> appear in the Afflictions, in the changes of his life? That notwithſtanding he had felt the ſweeneſs of a proſperous eſtate, and the comfort of freinds, yea, and the comfort of Gods favour ſhining upon his heart, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular mercies, yet when God turned his hand, and took away the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his life, the comfort and ſociety of his freinds, the comfortable expreſſions <pb n="49" facs="tcp:47453:31"/>of his own love to his ſoul, and threatned the taking away even of life it ſelf; <hi>Job</hi> could now in this caſe reſolve to reſt in the determination, and appointment and will of God. Here is <hi>Patience</hi> now.</p>
               <p>Thus briefly you have heard what the duty is, to which the Apoſtle exhorteth; It is <hi>Patience,</hi> that is, <hi>a willing reſigning of our ſelves to Gods appointment in the changes of our life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now that is not enough,
<note place="margin">VVhat I is to let patience have her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work. Rom 15.13. Colloſ. 1.11.</note> the Apoſtle contents not himſelf, to ſay; <hi>Have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> but <hi>let Patience have her perfect work;</hi> He would have them grow in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> to grow from one degree to another, to <hi>abound</hi> in <hi>Patience</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13.) that they might not only have <hi>patience,</hi> but have it brought to <hi>perfection,</hi> which in <hi>Coll.</hi> 1. 11. is called <hi>all long ſuffering,</hi> that there might not be the leaſt defect, that they might have a meaſure of <hi>patience</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the meaſure of Tryals: that look as God increaſed the meaſure of their tryals upon them, ſo they might have <hi>patience</hi> to anſwer thoſe tryals, ſomewhat to ſupport the heart, when the greateſt weight ſhould be laid upon the ſoul to preſs it down: ſo the word <hi>Hipomene,</hi> that is tranſlated <hi>patience</hi> ſignifieth, to bear up a man, to ſupport him under a burthen, that he be not preſt down by it. So he would have them have ſuch a meaſure of <hi>Patience,</hi> as might bear up the ſoul in the greateſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that though they were afflicted, they might not be broken in their afflictions. Thus you have the duty opened; <hi>Let Patience have her perfect work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon is, <hi>that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That you may be intire.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VVhat is meant by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing</note> Some underſtand it thus, that you may be <hi>intire</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of every grace, in reſpect of all gracious habits, that you may have one grace as well as another, that as you have <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>faith,</hi> ſo you may have <hi>Patience</hi> too, that which is ſo neceſſary a grace for a Chriſtian, as well as any other.</p>
               <p>Others by <hi>intireneſs</hi> here, and <hi>wanting nothing,</hi> think that the Apoſtle meant this, that they might have that which might ſupply comfort to their ſouls in all their wants, A man is then ſaid to <hi>want nothing,</hi> when he is content and ſatisfied with that eſtate wherein he is,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 30.6.</note> as if he had all things: So <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Ziglag</hi> was burnt, his Wives carried away captive, his ſouldiers began to mutiny, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him, yet nevertheleſs he ſeemed to want nothing, when he could <hi>comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Lord his God. Godlineſs is great gain;</hi> (but how?) <hi>with contentment;</hi> that is, there is ſuch a ſufficiency with contentment of heart, as if a man had the things he wants. So then hear is the thing, <hi>that you may be intire,</hi> in reſpect of all gracious habits, neceſſary to the beeing of a Chriſtian, that you may have that inward ſtore and ſupply of comfort, that may ſupport your hearts in all outward wants. Thus you have the meaning of the words.</p>

               <p>An argument to enforce that exhortation.</p>
               <p>The duty whereto they are exhorted is,
<note place="margin">1. A duty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to.</note> that they ſhould be <hi>perfect in Patience; let Patience have her perfect work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Argument whereby they are perſwaded to this duty,
<note place="margin">2. An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Inforce it.</note> 
                  <hi>is that they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and wanting nothing,</hi> that they may have all that is neceſſary to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
               <p>We will obſerve two Concluſions hence, which we ſhall follow at this time. The firſt is this;</p>
               <p>That Patience is neceſſary to the perfection of a Chriſtian.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1.</note> Or, A Chriſtian is not perfect without patience.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this;</p>
               <p>That every Chriſtian ſhould ſtrive for a perfection of degrees of Patience.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 2.</note> Or, that a Chriſtian muſt labour to attaine the higheſt degree and perfection in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:47453:32"/>
Theſe two Concluſions we will handle apart in the Explication and proof; and joyn them together in the application and uſe.</p>
               <p>For the firſt then,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1. A Chriſtian not perfect without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Mat. 5.48.</note> that <hi>A Chriſtian is not perfect without patience.</hi> Our Saviour exhorting his Diſciples to patience (in the fifth of <hi>Matth.</hi>) becauſe they ſhould meet with many enemies, &amp; injuries in the world, he concludeth, <hi>be perfect</hi> (faith he) <hi>as your heavenly father is perfect.</hi> What <hi>perfection</hi> ſpeaks he of here? Such a <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſuch a work of Grace, as might inable them to carry themſelves, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them in the middeſt of thoſe many enemies and oppoſites they ſhould meet withal.</p>
               <p>I will not ſtand upon this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1</note> I will endeavour to make it appear to you. Firſt it may appear thus.</p>
               <p>There is a twofold <hi>perfection</hi> of a Chriſtian;
<note place="margin">A twofold perfection of a Chriſtian.</note> There is a <hi>perfection</hi> of parts, and a <hi>perfection</hi> of degrees. A child is a perfect man in reſpect of parts, but not in reſpect of degrees, becauſe it is not come to that meaſure of ſtrength (for that age is not capable of it) which a man hath.</p>
               <p>Now there is a neceſſity that there ſhould be a <hi>perfection</hi> of parts.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Perfection of parts what it is.</note> 
                  <hi>perfection</hi> of parts in a Chriſtian, is but the making up of all thoſe graces which are neceſſary to a Chriſtian, and without which he cannot obey God, nor walk according to the rule: All theſe are neceſſary: Now <hi>Patience</hi> is one of thoſe parts, one of thoſe habits of grace with which every renewed ſoul is indowed, and without which a man is not truly ſanctified, without which a man expreſſeth himſelf not to be regenerate.
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.5,6.</note> And for this obſerve what the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ad more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to your faith, vertue, to vertue knowledge, to knowledg temperance, to temperance patience, to patience godlineſſe, to godlineſſe brotherly kindneſſe, to brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe love;</hi> What is the reaſon of it? <hi>If theſe things be in you and abound, you ſhall neither be idle, nor unfruitful in the work of the Lord.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, you will be idle and unfruitful profeſſors, unleſſe that theſe graces be in you, and abound in you. Now what are the Graces? you ſhall ſee the neceſſity of every one of them; The Apoſtle exhorteth beleevers there, to the <hi>giving all diligence to the making their calling and election ſare,</hi> to make it certain to themſelves that they are effectually called. But might ſome ſay, there are many graces neceſſary to a Chriſtian, but there is one principal, which we call the radical and main grace of all, Faith? I but ſaith the Apoſtle, there are many others neceſſary beſides that, as you muſt have faith towards God, ſo you muſt alſo carry your ſelves ſo, as may adorne your profeſſion among men, therefore <hi>adde vertue to faith.</hi> But they might ſay, <hi>vertue,</hi> that is that that guideth a man in all Morrals, in all the courſe of his life and converſation? You ſhall have many provocations to ſin, therefore <hi>adde to vertue temperance.</hi> But we have many diſcouragements to good? therefore <hi>adde to temperance Patience.</hi> But what though you ſhould have both <hi>temperance and Patience,</hi> theſe are but moral vertues? Therefore <hi>adde to Patience godlineſſe,</hi> that you may in all things you doe, ayme at God, and approve your ſelves to him. But when we have carried our ſelves in a holy manner, according to the rule and word of God, yet nevertheleſs there are many Chriſtians that require offices of love from us, and what ſhall we doe to theſe? Therefore <hi>adde to godlineſſe brotherly kindneſſe.</hi> But then again beſide that converſation we have with beleevers, there are many men in the world that expect certaine duties from us? Therefore <hi>adde</hi> to that, <hi>Love,</hi> that extendeth to all men according to their neceſſities. So you ſee how the Apoſtle takes all graces, as it were into ſeveral parcels, and ſheweth how they cannot be without one parcel of grace, they cannot goe through the courſe of Chriſtianitie, except they heve every thing; they cannot carry themſelves toward God without <hi>faith:</hi> they cannot adorne their profeſſion without <hi>vertue;</hi> they cannot eſcape temptations without <hi>temperance;</hi> neither can they be encouraged againſt diſcouragements without <hi>patience;</hi> Therefore he bringeth <hi>patience</hi> in amongſt the reſt, as a neceſſary part and dutie of a Chriſtian without which he cannot goe through the worke of Chriſtiantie and religion.</p>
               <p>Again in the ſecond place,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> as it appeareth by the parts of a Chriſtian and Chriſtianity, that a man cannot be perfect without <hi>Patience,</hi> ſo it appeareth by <pb n="51" facs="tcp:47453:32"/>another argument, and that is this; A Chriſtian cannot be perfect without that, without which he cannot keep that grace he hath. Look what ever grace is in the ſoul,
<note place="margin">Luke 21.19.</note> a man cannot keep it without <hi>Patience. By Patience poſſeſſe your ſouls.</hi> The ſoul which is the ſeate and ſubject of Grace, cannot it ſelf be kept without <hi>Patience,</hi> therefore neither can any grace be kept in the ſoul without <hi>Patience:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as the riches and treaſures in a Caſtle cannot be kept, when the walls are beaten downe, ſo thoſe treaſures of grace in the heart of man cannot be kept, when once <hi>patience,</hi> which is as the wall of the ſoul, that keeps it from the battery of tentations, from the enemie that would ſteale them away while men ſleep; I ſay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe theſe walls, theſe ſupporting graces, ſpecially this of <hi>Patience</hi> be in the ſoul, it cannot ſtand intire.</p>
               <p>For indeed let impatience once into the ſoul, and you let in all ſin with it; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience is a deſtroying of all grace, a pulling downe of the wall. Nay, what is ſin indeed, but impatience in a ſenſe? What is pride, but the impatience of humilitie? What is uncleanneſſe, but the impatience of chaſtity? What is drunkenneſſe, but the impatience of ſobrietie? Every ſin beginneth in impatience, when a man cannot bear with that abſtinence, and forbearance as formerly, cannot keep that ſtrict courſe in his wayes, but groweth impatient againſt the rule of God, he runneth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a courſe of ſin preſently. So you ſee that for the very preſerving the ſoul, the ſubject of grace, and grace the treaſure of the ſoul, it is neceſſary that we ſhould have <hi>patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then again thirdly;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3,</note> It will appear thus to you, that a Chriſtian cannot be perfect without <hi>patience;</hi> becauſe he cannot doe his worke without <hi>Patience;</hi> he cannot doe the works of Religion, the taske that God layes upon him without <hi>Patience.</hi> Looke in what meaſure <hi>Patience</hi> is defective, in that meaſure he halteth in his dutie, in the very actions of Religion he goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
               <p>Take any one duty of Religion that you can name,
<note place="margin">No dutie can be rightly performed without pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Not Prayer Matth. 15.</note> ſee whether a man can doe that without <hi>Patience.</hi> Suppoſe it be Prayer; How can a man goe on in the duty of prayer without <hi>Patience?</hi> Sometimes God delayeth the grant of a mans petition: A man will now ſink, and give over in diſcouragement, if he have not <hi>Patience</hi> to ſupport the ſoul. The <hi>Canaanitiſh woman,</hi> when ſhe came to Chriſt, and ſpake once to him, and he did not anſwer a word; ſhe had ſo much <hi>Patience</hi> as to make her ſpeak the ſecond time to him, then he anſwered her, but churliſhly; but yet her <hi>Patience</hi> held her to the third tryal, at laſt ſhe received her deſire: had ſhe not been <hi>Patient</hi> to go on with her requeſt, ſhe had loſt her petition. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>for this thing</hi> (faith he) <hi>I beſought the Lordthrice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.</note> He would have given over at the firſt ſeeking of the Lord, if he had not had <hi>Patience</hi> to uphold him to the ſecond, and third petition, to the renewing of his ſuit twice, nay thrice.</p>
               <p>Come from praying to hearing the Word preached;
<note place="margin">Not hearing.</note> how can a man hear the word profitably without <hi>Patience?</hi> therefore the good ground is ſaid to hear the Word,
<note place="margin">Luk. 8.15. Rev. 3.10.</note> 
                  <hi>and to bring forth fruit with Patience:</hi> and it is the commendation of the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, Thou haſt kept the word of my Patience.</hi> There is a neceſſity of <hi>Patience,</hi> if a man will profit by the Word.</p>
               <p>For firſt, if a man will obey the Word, he ſhall be ſure to have many ſet againſt him in the world, he had need of <hi>Patience</hi> then, or elſe he will leave the rule of the Word, becauſe of the reproaches of the world.</p>
               <p>Again, there are many ſecret corruptions in his own heart that will be met with in the preaching of the Word, which a man cannot abide to hear of, but he will be vexing and fretting, and diſcontented at it (as we ſee in <hi>Ahab</hi> and divers others) unleſſe he have <hi>Patience</hi> to keep him from raging againſt the Preacher, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word.
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.36.</note> You <hi>have need of Patience</hi> then (as the Apoſtle faith) that you may bear thereproofs, and exhortations of the Word. Therefore faith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James, 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Receive with Patience the ingrafted Word, or receive with meekneſſe, the ingrafted Word, that is able to ſave your ſouls.</hi> There is no ingrafting the Word in the heart, except thoſe forms of impatience, thoſe hinderances of the growth of the Word be taken away</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:47453:33"/>
But further,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4.</note> there is yet a further end: the whole life of a Chriſtian is a continual exerciſe of <hi>Patience,</hi> there is a neceſſity of it, for he cannot perſevere without <hi>Patience,</hi> it is impoſſible for a man to begin in the ſpirit, but he ſhall end in the fleſh,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.36.</note> if he have not <hi>Patience</hi> to perſevere in well doing. Therefore faith the Apoſtle, <hi>You have need of Patience, that after you have obeyed, you might receive the promiſe.</hi> You have need of <hi>Patience,</hi> for between the time of the making of the Promiſe, and the time of the accompliſhment of the Promiſe to the ſoul, there is a great diſtance many times, therefore <hi>ye have need of Patience,</hi> to waite, that <hi>after you have obeyed the Word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> 
                  <hi>you might receive the promiſe. Let us run with Patience the race that is ſet before us, looking to Jeſus the Authour, and finiſher of our faith.</hi> Our Lord Jeſus himſelf had not perfected the worke of our redemption, if he had wanted <hi>Patience:</hi> neither can we finiſh our courſe of Chriſtianity (wherein we muſt follow Chriſt) and <hi>run the race that is ſet before us,</hi> except we have <hi>Patience</hi> added to other graces.</p>
               <p>You ſee then a Chriſtian cannot be perfect without <hi>Patience;</hi> Firſt, becauſe he cannot have all the parts of Chriſtianity, that is one thing. Secondly, becauſe he cannot keep and preſerve the graces he hath, that is another thing. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot act and work according to the rule, that is the third. Laſtly, becauſe he cannot perſervere in the courſe he is in, except he have <hi>Patience.</hi> There is a neceſſity of <hi>Patience</hi> to the prefection of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 2. Chriſtian muſt labour for perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Patience. Coll. 1.11.</note> the ſecond point was, That it is the duty of a Chriſtian to ſtrive to bring <hi>Patience</hi> to the uttermoſt perfection, to be as perfect in the degrees of <hi>Patience</hi> as he can attain to, to make this the ſtrife of his life, that <hi>Patience</hi> may have her perfect work, that there may be no defect in it. The Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Colloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> that <hi>they may be ſtrengthned in the inward man to all long ſuffering.</hi> And when our Saviour ſetteth God as a pattern before men,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5, 48.</note> 
                  <hi>Be you perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect;</hi> What aymeth he at in that place but this? that we ſhould ſtrive to the uttermoſt extent, and higheſt degrees of <hi>Patience,</hi> for our Saviour intendeth of <hi>Patience</hi> in that place. This then is the duty of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Why ſo?</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> becauſe a Chriſtian is to follow the beſt pattern: the beſt patterns are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Scripture. And God doth not propound examples and Patterns to men in vain: but as he giveth them rules to tell them what they ſhould do, ſo he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them examples and patterns to lead them to that degree, and direct them in the manner of doing. Therefore ye have God himſelf ſet as a pattern of <hi>Patience: Follow God as dear children;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph 5:</note> wherein? In all thoſe examples wherein you have a rule. For all the examples of God, and Chriſt, and the Saints, bind no further, then there is a rule in the Word. There are many things wherein we cannot follow God and Chriſt, and we need not follow every one of the Saints; but thoſe things that are injoyned by the rule, theſe examples are ſet to direct us in obedience to that rule. Amongſt other things, the <hi>Patience</hi> of God is ſet forth as a pattern for us to follow.
<note place="margin">Exod. 34.7. Rom. 11.</note> In that glorious proclamation made of him, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7, 8. Among other of his attributes, he is ſet out to be <hi>a God long ſuffering and Patient. You ſee
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.2 Pt. 2:</note> how patient God is</hi> (faith the Apoſtle) <hi>And God that he might ſhew his long-ſuffering and Patience, bore with the world,</hi> faith Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> With what world? <hi>with the world of ungodly men.</hi> God hath born with the world many Ages of years, many thouſand years already, and yet beareth ſtill with the world. The moſt holy God that perfectly hateth wickedneſſe, yet to ſhew his <hi>Patience,</hi> he beareth with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ones:</hi> Yea, and he beareth with men too: the mighty God, that is able to deſtroy all the world, with the very breath of his mouth, that as with a word he made the world, ſo with a blaſt he is able to bring it to nothing, yet this mighty God beareth with men, this holy God, with ungodly men; yea, and this God that might ſuddenly deſtroy the earth, as he did the old World with water, he beareth ſo many thouſand years with the world of ungodly men, that his <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering</hi> may appear. You have God for an example then.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:47453:33"/>
And Chriſt for an example too:
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.29.</note> and <hi>you are predeſtinated for this very end, to be like the Image of the Son,</hi> to be made conformable unto Chriſt; Wherein? In all imitable and neceſſary graces. I ſay, in all thoſe graces that are neceſſary, by vertue of a rule, and that are imitable, wherein we may or can follow him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt this is one, his <hi>Patience.</hi> See the <hi>Patience</hi> of Chriſt. In his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage toward his Father, how he bore the diſpleaſure of his Father: In his carriage toward men, when he might have commanded <hi>fire from heaven,</hi> yet you ſee how he bore with them,
<note place="margin">Luke. 9.</note> and rebuked his Diſciples, <hi>You know not of what ſpirit you are. He was lead as a lambe, dumb before the ſhearers; and he opened not his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">James 5.10.</note> you have the examples of the ſervants of God. <hi>Take my brethren</hi> (faith Saint <hi>James) the Prophets who have ſpoken in the name of the Lord, for an enſample of ſuffering affliction, and of Patience.</hi> The Prophets ſuffered long, and endured the frowns of the world, and the rage of Princes, they endured a thouſand miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<note place="margin">verſe 11.</note> and all to diſcharge their duty. But amongſt all the ſervants of God, <hi>You have heard of the Patience of Job, and what end the Lord made with him.</hi> Every man can ſpeak of the <hi>patience</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note> but this was written for our enſample, to teach us to be patient as he was: <hi>Whatſoever things were written afore-time, were written for our learnings, that we through Patience, and comfort of the Scriptures, might have hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again ſecondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> as it is neceſſary for a Chriſtian to ſtrive for the perfection of <hi>Patience</hi> in the degrees of it, becauſe of the conformity that ſhould be between him, and thoſe examples of God, of Chriſt, and of the Saints, between God the Father, and beleevers his children; between Chriſt the head, and beleevers his members; between the Saints of God, children of the ſame Father, and ſervants of the ſame Maſter, that ſhould honour him in the ſame grace of <hi>Patience.</hi> So There is a neceſſity likewiſe of it, in reſpect of the tryals whereunto a Chriſtian may be put: you had need to ſtrive that you may be <hi>perfect in Patience,</hi> becauſe you know not what tryals ye ſhall be put to, what times ye are reſerved to. Every man muſt expect troubles and afflictions, they are called <hi>Tribulations,</hi> and you know what <hi>Tribulum</hi> was, the Iron ball that was full of pikes round about, ſo that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it was caſt it did ſtick; and Engine uſed in war: Tribulations are unavoydable they will fall and ſtick, ye cannot eſcape them on any ſide, by any turning to the right hand, or to the left.
<note place="margin">Acts 14.22.2. Tim. 3.12.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the will of God, that through many tribulations we ſhould enter into the kingdome of heaven: and whoſoever will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now (beloved) is this ſo, that this is a Statute in heaven, decreed, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, and will not be reverſed, like the lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> that every man muſt paſſe to heaven through tribulation, and affliction upon earth; then it concerns every one to be armed, to get ſuch a meaſure of <hi>patience</hi> as may ſupport him in ſuch afflictions. Ye know not what afflictions ye may have, what particular tryals God may put ye to: In what a miſerable caſe then is a man, if he be to ſeek of his armour; when he is in the middeſt of the pikes; if he be then to get <hi>patience,</hi> when he is in the middeſt of tryals, when he is diſturbed and diſtracted with vexation of ſpirit? What fooliſh diſorderly ſpeeches proceed from men in the time of affliction? We may ſee it in <hi>David, ſo fooliſh was I and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.27.</note> and in this point a beaſt before thee.</hi> What fooliſh, ſenſual, beaſtly ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, unreaſonable abſurd paſſages proceed from men in thoſe times of trouble, if they have not got to themſelves before hand this grace, and are not fitted to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian carriage in time by <hi>patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus ye ſee the neceſſity of <hi>patience</hi> to the perfection of a Chriſtian, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the perfection of <hi>patience</hi> to the ornament of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Now we come to make uſe of both theſe together.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For reproofe</note> Firſt, it ſerveth for the juſt reproof of Chriſtians that are careful for other parts, and acts of religion, and are not ſo ſeriouſly mindful of this duty of <hi>patieuce</hi> as they ſhould be, but are ſo farre from ſtriving for <hi>patience,</hi> that they ſeem rather to ſtrive for impatience, that make their croſſes more heavy, and their afflictions more bitter then they would be. Indeed we make Gods Cup (that of it ſelf is grievous enough to nature and to <pb n="54" facs="tcp:47453:34"/>ſenſe (by putting into it our own ingredients, that are inbred in our own paſſions, and pride and ſelf-will, and our own earthly minds, farre more bitter then elſe it would be.</p>
               <p>But how doth a man make afflictions worſe?</p>
               <p>There are divers wayes that men take,
<note place="margin">VVayes how men increaſe Impatience in themſelves.</note> wherein they are ſo far from perfecting <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi> in themſelves, that they wholly deſtroy <hi>Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is, by their agravating of their afflictions, by all the ſeveral circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that poſſible they can invent.

                  <hi>is there any affliction like my affliction, wherewith the Lord hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me?</hi> The like ſpeech you have ordinarily in the mouths of perſons; Is there any affliction like mine? there is no body ſo wronged in their name as I; nor hath ſuch pain in their body, nor never went with ſuch an heavy heart as I; never any man ſuffered ſo many injuries by freinds and enemies, and all ſorts of people, as I have done: at if all the afflictions in the world, the flouds and waves of tryalls, were all met upon one perſon. This is the language of men, whereby they aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their afflictions, and increaſe impatience in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2. By giving liberry to their paſſions.</note> another way whereby they do is, is this; By giving vent and free courſe to their paſſions, Paſſions are like a wild horſe, if they have not reines put upon them, if they be not pulled in, they will flie out to all exceſſe. If once we give our Paſſions vent, there is no ſtoping of them. <hi>David,</hi> we ſee checks himſelf, he had a curb to bridle his paſſions; <hi>Why art thou caſt downe, oh my ſoule?</hi> But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe when men give the reines to their paſſion, and doe not ſtop their courſe, but think they have reaſon for it, they break out into all exhorbitancie. <hi>Ionah,</hi> when the Lord challenged him for his anger, <hi>Doſt thou well to be angry? I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I doe well to be angry even to the death.</hi> So <hi>David, Oh Abſalom, my ſonne, would God I had died for thee; Oh Abſalom, my ſonne my ſonne.</hi> What hurt was done to <hi>David?</hi> what wrong had the man to take on thus? his ſonne was tooke from him, but it was <hi>Abſalom: Abſalom</hi> died, but it was <hi>Abſolom</hi> that would have killed his father: and yet he takes on, as if the father could not live, becauſe the ſonne that ſought his death, was tooke from him. Such unreaſonable Paſſions, ſuch cauſeleſſe diſtempers oft-times are in the ſoules of men, that they miſtake Gods wayes, and that very way that he intendeth them good in, they complain of, as if it were their utter undoing,</p>
               <p>Again thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. By reſuſing comfort.</note> another way whereby men increaſe their impatience and diſtemper is, when they will not give way to comfort: they will not only be exceeding vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and intent upon their Paſſions, but beſides, ſtop all paſſages and in-lets, againſt comfort;
<note place="margin">Gen. 37.34.</note> It was <hi>Iacobs</hi> fault concerning the death of <hi>Joſeph:</hi> When he heard that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was dead, not onely his heart ſunck within him, but he rends his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and covereth himſelfe with ſack-cloth, he takes on ſo, that when his ſonnes and children roſe up to comfort him, he would not be comforted: Why? Becauſe <hi>Joſeph</hi> was not, and <hi>I will go to the grave to Joſeph:</hi> nothing would comfort <hi>Jacob</hi> but he would goe <hi>downe to the grave to Joſeph</hi> by all means. What a great matter was this? He only heard that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was dead, he was alive, he knew not ſo much but he heard a preſent ſound of fear, and he was carried away with that. So it is with us, the very apprehenſion of our feares are as bad to us, as the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could poſſible be. Nay we multiply upon our ſelves, our fears, and we will not hear counſel and comfort, as <hi>Rachel, that mourned for her children, and would not be comforted, becauſe they were not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">4. By looking only on affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions preſent not on mercies</note> a fourth thing whereby men increaſe impatience in themſelves, and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their ſorrowes, is this, when men look only upon the preſent afflictions, and not upon the mercies they have: as if they had but one eye to behold all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with, as if they could look but upon one thing at once: there ſhould be a <pb n="55" facs="tcp:47453:34"/>looking upon the affliction, and there ſhould be a looking upon the mercy too. This was <hi>Hamans</hi> caſe: when he was vexed that <hi>Mordecay</hi> did not do him reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, all his wealth and his honours could do him no good: he had much wealth, and the <hi>glory of his houſe was increaſed,</hi> he had the favour of the King, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to have the honour of the Queen put upon him;
<note place="margin">Eſt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>yet all this availeth me nothing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo long as I ſee Mordecay the Jew ſitting in the Kings gate.</hi> He looks only on this particular that vexed and grieved him, and not upon the reſt. So it is with us, if there be but one particular affliction upon us, we fix our eyes upon that: Like a Flie, that flieth about the glaſs, and can ſtick no where till ſhe come to ſome crack: or as a Gnat that cometh about the body of a beaſt, that will be ſure to ſtick on the galled part, or ſome ſore or other. So it is with theſe diſquieted thoughts of men, that are of no other uſe, but to further Sathans ends, to weaken their faith, and diſcourage their own hearts; men ſtick on the gall, on the ſore of any affliction, there they will reſt. It is true, God hath given us ſuch and ſuch favours and mercies, hath offered us ſuch and ſuch opportunities, but what is this? this and that particular affliction is upon me. This is that, that increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth impatience, when a man will not look on the mercies he receiveth, but only looks on that that he wanteth.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">5. By looking on the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and not on God.</note> a fifth courſe that men take to aggravate their ſorrows, and increaſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience in themſelves is this. They look upon the inſtrument of their ſorrows and afflictions, but never look up to God that ruleth, and over-ruleth theſe things; Men look upon ſuch a perſon, ſuch a man and no more. Ye ſee how <hi>David</hi> was diſquieted at this:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 55.12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>If it had been an enemie that reproached him, then he could have born it;</hi> but it was <hi>thou my freind, my equall, my guid, my acquaintance, that ſate at my table, we took ſweet counſel together, and walked unto the houſe of God in company;</hi> This troubled him; and ſee how he multiplied his ſorrows, when he looked upon the inſtrument,
<note place="margin">Plal. 39.9.</note> till he looked upon God, and then <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> There is no quiet in the heart, when a man looks upon man, till he looks upon God that ordereth all things by his wiſdom and counſel.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">6. By looking on the ſmart and not on the benefit of affliction.</note> men aggravate their ſorrows, and increaſe their impatience, by another courſe they take, that is, when they look on their ſorrows and afflictions only, and not upon the benefit of affliction: they look only upon that that fleſh would avoyd, but not that which if they were ſpiritual and wiſe they would deſire. <hi>No affliction</hi> (faith the Apoſtle) <hi>is joyous for the time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.11.</note> that is, to fleſh and nature, <hi>but grievous, nevertheleſs, afterward it yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs to them which are exerciſed thereby.</hi> Now men look upon that only which is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous in affliction, upon the ſmart of it, but not upon the profit of affliction, the quiet fruit of righteouſneſs that cometh by it. As a man when he hath a Corroding plaiſter put to a ſore, he cryeth and complaineth of the ſmart it putteth him to, but takes no notice of the healing that cometh by it, and the cure that followeth. Thus it is with men, they complain of God, as if he envied them the comfort of their lives, as if he intended to rob them of all conveniencies, and to make them ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly miſerable, to begin a Hell with them on earth, when they never look how God by this means fitteth them for heaven, by this means purging out corruption, and ſtrengthening grace in them:
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.32</note> 
                  <hi>We are afflicted of the Lord, that we may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of the world:</hi> Men look upon the affliction, not upon their freedom from condemnation.</p>
               <p>So much for that. I come now to a ſecond uſe.</p>
               <p>You ſee here the way whereby men aggravate affliction, and get cauſes of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in themſelves, and if we ſeriouſly conſider it, we ſhall find one of theſe, the ordinary cauſes of all diſtempers, and impatience in loſſes, in ſickneſſes, in diſtreſs of mind, in croſſes upon a mans name, or whatſoever befalleth him amiſs in the world, that which makes him flie out, that which makes him, that he cannot ſubmit unto God, it is ſome of theſe particulars here ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>Let it therefore in the ſecond place,
<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But all the queſtion is, how a man may get it.</p>
               <p>As there are two ſorts of afflictions in a mans life, ſo <hi>Patience</hi> hath two offices. One affliction is thoſe preſent evils that a man undergoeth and ſuffereth, <hi>Patience</hi> is to ſupport him in thoſe preſent miſeries and calamities.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of tryal is, when the good that a man expects is delayed, and is not preſently granted, and here <hi>patience</hi> is neceſſary in this caſe alſo. I will ſhew ye how a man may ſet <hi>patience</hi> a work in both theſe, and ſo conclude.</p>

               <p>Brieſly, the way for a man to get <hi>patience</hi> in ſuch caſes as theſe, is this.</p>

Secondly, give him the glory of his wiſdome. Thirdly, give him the glory of his mercy in thoſe changes of thy life that ſeem moſt grievous to thee.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Therefore give him the glory of his ſoveraignty</note> I ſay, give him the glory of his abſolute ſoveraignty. Acknowledge him an abſolute in-dependant Lord, that doth what he will among the creatures. His will is the rule of all his actions upon the creatures here below, and uncontroul'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable. It is high arrogancy, and preſumption, and pride of ſpirit, for the creature to conteſt with his Creator, concerning his actions on earth. Let every man reaſon thus; I muſt give God the glory of his Soveraignty, and acknowledge that he hath power and right, to rule all the <hi>families of the earth;</hi> and why not mine as well as another? Why not my perſon as well as anothers? Why not to order all the changes of my life,

That which <hi>Benhadad</hi> ſpake proudly to <hi>Ahab, thy ſilver and thy gold, thy wives and thy children, and thy houſe, and thy Citie are mine;</hi> That may God ſpeak truely, and by right; All that thon haſt, and all that thou art, is mine, therefore give him that glory that <hi>Job</hi> did in the change of his life;

<note place="margin">2 Sam, 15 25</note> and it becometh not ſervants to ſtand and contend with their Lord.

God is a wiſe God, that knoweth what eſtate is beſt for thee; not onely when tryals are better than comforts, but what one kind of tryall is better then another: it may be it is better to exerciſe one with poverty, another with diſgrace, another with ſpiritual trouble, another with reſtraint of liberty, which particular tryall is neceſſary to cure that diſeaſe, and which this, that is in my ſoul: the heavenly Phyſitian will bring that upon thee as a ſpirituall preſcription, and a heavenly courſe that he takes in inſinite wiſdome to cure thee.</p>

That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies increaſe mercies.</note> Gods delayes are not only not denials, but improvements of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; God increaſeth and commendeth the excellencies of his mercies by delayes, he recompenceth our expectation, and waiting for them, with putting in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſweetneſs into thoſe favours when they come: I ſay, God increaſeth the comfort anſwerable to the delay,

<note place="margin">2. Cor 1.</note> Here is the iſſue; <hi>As our afflictions have abonnded, ſo our conſolations abound much more.</hi> This is the courſe of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. That delaies are but ſhort, compared to eternitie.</note> know that Gods delayes are never long; at the longeſt they are but for a ſhort time: what if he delay a year? what if twenty, thirty, forty, years? what if the the life of a man? this is no great delay. Compare this time of thy waiting for mercy, with the time to come of thy enjoying of mercy. A ſmall time of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on earth, to an eternity of recompence in heaven. Compare eternity with the time of thy ſuffering. Alas how little, what a ſmall or no agreement is between them? A moment to eternity. If the life of a man ſhould extend to a hundred years, to a thouſand yeares (to which age never man yet lived) yet that is but a point, a moment, to eternity. A <hi>thouſand years</hi> paſt and to come, <hi>they are but as yester-day to God.</hi> Take the eternity paſt, in God himſelf that is without all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and the eternity to come, that ſhall be without all end, and put the life of man in the middeſt of theſe two, and we will conclude, it is as a point in the middeſt of a circumference, it is but a moment; nay, not ſo much as a moment of time. Stretch out the duty of <hi>Patience</hi> then; haſt thou waited a week? wait a month, a year, ſeven years, ſeventy years, nay ſeventy Ages, all the ages of the world if it were poſſible; All theſe are but a moment to eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:47453:36"/>
And where is there a man that hath waited ſo long, but God, that his ſervants may not faint in their expectation, either ſupports them with other comforts, leſt they ſhould faint in their deſire, or elſe giveth them that which they deſire before their hearts faint. Know therefore, that it is no ſuch great matter for a man to wait upon God, it is but a ſhort time: and reſolve in the time of thy waiting upon this, that when thou art fitteſt for mercy, it ſhall come, and when it cometh, it ſhall come with an abundant weight and ſweetneſs, ſuch as ſhall countervail all thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and waiting.</p>
               <p>Thus I have told you how men ſhould exerciſe patience by exerciſing their faith: and how they ſhould ſtrengthen patience by hope: and how they ſhould perfect <hi>patience</hi> by ſelfe-denyal.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why I took this Text for the preſent occaſion is, that there might be a concurrence between the rule and the example. Here is the rule, <hi>Let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect, and intire wanting nothing.</hi> One reaſon among others was this, becauſe we know not what changes and tryals, God hath reſerved any of us to, therefore we <hi>had need of patience.</hi> Our Siſter here is the example; a pattern to others of thoſe tryals of life, whereto a Chriſtan may be expoſed even to extremity. Howſoever it pleaſed God to give many other mercies to her, yet nevertheleſs ſhe had a continual exerciſe of <hi>patience,</hi> in extream an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of body, in a vexing tormenting pain, that a long time, for many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether held her under ſuch extremity of torture, that a man on the rack, or in any other extremity, could hardly have greater torments then ſhe ſometime felt, in the time of that extremity upon her. God laid this affliction upon her to <hi>perfect</hi> her <hi>patience,</hi> and that ſhe might be a pattern of <hi>patience</hi> to you, that you might ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and pray for <hi>Patience,</hi> and endeavour after it, that when afflictions fall upon any of you, you may not be found wanting, and deſtitute of <hi>patience.</hi> So much for this time.</p>

               <p>There is a faſt inforced by neceſſity, that which either is by ſickneſſe or want, and is meerly civil and outward, without any reſpect to God. And there is a faſt too, which hath a pretence of reſpect to God, which is not acceptable, as that of the Phariſees, that reſted only in the external action. There is a faſt that is religious,
<note place="margin">

It was not ſuch a weeping as ariſeth meerly from the temper of the body, as in ſome that are more apt for tears, are; ſuch as the tears of <hi>Eſau</hi> to his father, <hi>he lift up his voice and wept, haſt thou not one bleſſing more? bleſſe me, even me alſo, oh my father.</hi> But they were tears that did ariſe from a holy affection, from a gracious diſpoſition of heart, from inward contrition and ſorrow; like the tears that <hi>Peter ſhed, when he went out and wept bitterly.</hi> They were tears that diſcovered the inward vehemency of his ſpirit in prayer:
<note place="margin">Gen. 32. Hſo. 12.</note> like thoſe tears of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he wreſtled with the Angel, the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> telleth how he wreſtled, <hi>he prayed and wept.</hi> Such tears were theſe; as did expreſſe the fervency of his ſpirit in prayer, the earneſtneſſe of his deſire, in putting up this requeſt he had now to God:
<note place="margin">Iſa. 38.</note> like thoſe of <hi>Hezekiah; I have heard thy prayers, and ſeen thy tears,</hi> ſaith God: ſuch tears as God <hi>putteth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

There are no tears that are ſhed for ſin, our of an inward ſorrow of heart, that are ſhed in prayer, to expreſe a holy deſire, that proceed from an inward inflamed affection and fervency of ſpirit, but they are very precious with God: as far (I ſay) as they declare the inward truth of the heart, and the inward ſenſe of our wants, and the weight of the petition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> we put up to God. Such were theſe tears here: <hi>I faſted and wept.</hi> I will not ſtand upon this.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this action,
<note place="margin">2. The reaſon of <hi>Davids</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> why he faſted and wept. I did it for this end, <hi>for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſaid, who knoweth whether the Lord will be gratious to me, that the <pb n="63" facs="tcp:47453:38"/>child may live?</hi> A man may wonder if he read the former part of the chapter, whence this perſwaſion and hope ſhould come into the heart of <hi>David,</hi> that there ſhould be a poſſibility of having the life of this child by his prayer, whereas the Lord had ſaid before by <hi>Nathan</hi> to him, <hi>that the child ſhould die. Nathan</hi> had told him in expreſſe terms that the child ſhould die, yet he putteth up his prayer for it, and ſaid, <hi>Who knoweth whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt know therefore that God ſometime,
<note place="margin">Gods abſolute ſentence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> even in thoſe ſentences that ſeem abſolute, implies, and intends a condition. <hi>David</hi> had reſpect to ſuch a courſe as God ordinarily took: he knew well that God at other times had threatned things, yet nevertheleſſe upon the repentance, and prayers, and tears, upon the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and contrition of the hearts of his ſervants, he hath been pleaſed to alter the ſentence, to ſuſpend, nay (it may be) wholly to take away and change the Execution. Thus it hath been; It was ſo in the caſe of <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> The Lord ſent as expreſs a meſſage by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 38.</note> as he did by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> to <hi>David: Set thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die and not live.</hi> Yet nevertheleſſe <hi>Hezekiah turneth his face to the wall,</hi> he wept, and laid open his requeſt before the Lord: <hi>Remember now, oh Lord, I beſeech the, how I have walked before thee, in truth, and with a perfect heart,</hi> &amp;c. Ye ſee, the Lord preſently ſendeth the Prophet to tell him, that he had <hi>added fifteen years to his life:</hi> and yet the meſſage was carried in expreſſe words, and in as peremptory terms, as a man would have thought it had been abſolute, and no condition intended.</p>
               <p>The like in the caſe of <hi>Niniveh.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jonah. 3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Jonah</hi> cometh to <hi>Niniveh, and began to enter the City, a dayes journey, and he cried,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Yet forty dayes, and Nineveh ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> Here was the time limited, the judgement declared, and no condition expreſt: yet the King of <hi>Nineveh humbleth himſelf, and the people, they faſt and pray, and go in ſackcloth,</hi> &amp;c. and the Lord was pleaſed to alter this ſentence.</p>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, theſe Examples were after <hi>Davids</hi> time, What were theſe to him? upon what ground did he take this courſe? had he any promiſe or example before time of any ſuch thing as this, that did give him incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to faſt and pray, in hope that though God had ſaid the child ſhould die, yet it ſhould live?</p>
               <p>Certainly <hi>David</hi> had examples before time of the like nature, when God had threatned judgements, and they did not know, whether the iſſue would prove or no as they deſired, yet they ſought God. As in the caſe of <hi>Saul.</hi> When the Lord ſent an expreſſe meſſage by <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> that the kingdom ſhould be taken from him and given to another, becauſe he had not dealt faithfully in the execution of Gods command concerning <hi>Amaleck,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſe 35:</note> yet ſaith the text, <hi>Samuel mourned for Saul ſtill.</hi> Inſomuch as the Lord queſtioneth him; <hi>How long wilt thou mourn for Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 16.1.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeeing I have rejected him from raigning over Iſrael:</hi> Yet <hi>Samuel</hi> continued in ſeeking God: as if he ſhould ſay, Who knoweth what the Lord will do?</p>
               <p>But more expreſly <hi>David</hi> had examples before his time, not only of ſeeking the Lord, but of a gracious ſucceſſe, and anſwer that thoſe had that ſought him. As in the caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when there was a diſcontent among the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ill report that the Spies put upon the good land, the people began now to murmur againſt God:
<note place="margin">Num. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Well</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes,</hi>) <hi>let me alone, and I will deſtroy this people at once. Moſes</hi> ſetteth himſelf to ſeek the Lord, and prayeth, and preſſeth the Lord with many arguments, for his own glory, for his peoples ſake, for his Covenant ſake, and many other wayes to ſpare them. What was the iſſue of it? He was heard, the Lord told him that he had heard his prayer, and granted his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, <hi>though he would fill the earth with his glory,</hi> and all the world ſhould know what a jealous God he was, another way; yet in this particular he had granted his requeſt, they ſhould not be cut off at this time.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>David</hi> had good experience, that though judgement hath been threatned before, yet nevertheleſſe courſes have been taken that the ſentence hath been <pb n="64" facs="tcp:47453:39"/>altered, with a change of Gods purpoſe at all. For God ever intended it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with a condition, if they returned not to him he would go on, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to him, he would not go on. So the purpoſe of God remaineth unchangeable. yet the ſentence according to the externall expreſſion ſeemeth altered to us: ſo the change is in us, and not in God.</p>
               <p>Hence let us note ſomething (briefly) for our ſelves,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and that is this; Firſt, how to underſtand all theſe threatnings in Scripture, that ſeem peremptory and abſolute, by this rule. A judgement is threatned, againſt a nation, againſt a perſon, or family, &amp;c. Yea, and it is abſolutely threatned in divers places; becauſe thou haſt done ſuch and ſuch evils, therefore ſuch and ſuch things ſhall come upon thee. All ſuch as theſe, are to be underſtood conditionally, though they ſeem to be expreſſed abſolutely.
<note place="margin">Jer. 18 7.</note> And the rule, God himſelf giveth. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it. If that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to doe unto them.</hi> Whatſoever I threatned in my Word, if they turn to me by true repentance, I will turn all that evil from them, that I have threatned againſt them, and would certainly have brought upon them, if they have not returned.</p>
               <p>I ſay,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. For incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,</note> thus we are to underſtand all theſe: and upon this ground we may build ſome further uſes, that I will but touch. Firſt, to take off thoſe diſcouragments, that lie upon the hearts of many; When they find themſelves guilty of a ſin againſt God, when they ſee, that, ſin threatned with ſevere puniſhment, and judgement in the word of God: now they conclude their caſe to be diſperate, it is in vain to ſeek further, to uſe the means, the Lord will proceed in judgement, and there is no ſtopping of him. This is an addition to a mans other ſins to conclude thus. Mark how the Lord expreſſeth himſelf in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> 33. The people were much troubled about ſuch things there,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 33.10, 11.</note> ſay they; <hi>Our transgreſſions, and our ſins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how ſhall we then live?</hi> The Prophet had incouraged them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their great ſins to return by true repentance, and they ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; nevertheleſs they are muttering, diſcouraged with fear, breaking their ſpirits, withdrawing themſelves from God: the judgements of God are begun upon us, the hand of wrath is gone out againſt us, <hi>we are pining away in them,</hi> though we are not waſted yet, yet we are like a man in a conſumption, that waſteth by degrees, how ſhall we live? certainly we ſhall die. Saith the Lord, ſay not thus among your ſelves, but know if ye turn, ye ſhall live; <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil wayes, for why will ye die, oh houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beware of diſcouragment therefore, it is Sathans device, that when once he hath drawn men from God by a path of ſin to hold them under diſcouragement, that ſo he may ever after keep them from turning to God again. It was his device where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would have kept <hi>Adam</hi> from turning to God, after he had committed that great ſin in eating of the forbidden tree; He thought of nothing but hiding himſelf from God,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> and ſo he did hide himſelf amongſt the buſhes of the Garden: <hi>I heard thy voyce, and was afraid, and I hid my ſelf:</hi> Mark, here was a fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in <hi>Adam,</hi> that whereas he ſhould have come and fell down before the Lord, and have begged mercy, and ſaid as <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>Who knoweth whether the Lord will be gracious, to me?</hi> He run clean away from God. There is a fear of reverence that keepeth a man with God, and there is a fear, that draweth a man to God: but this fear of diſcouragement driveth a man from God: and that is the temptation of Sathan, to keep a man from God, when once he hath turned aſide from him. Therefore (that is the firſt thing) take heed of ſuch inward diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may drive you quite off.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Take incouragement then to ſeek the face of God in his own means and way. He hath threatned judgements againſt others for the ſame ſins that ye find your ſelves guilty of, when they have returned to him, they have found mercy. Return ye to him in truth, and ſeek his face aright, and ye ſhall find the ſame mercy. In the propheſie of <hi>Joel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joel 2.12, 13.</note> ye ſhall ſee there, that though God had threatned judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <pb n="65" facs="tcp:47453:39"/>nay, though he had begun judgement (for that was the caſe of thoſe times, judgement was begun upon them) yet nevertheleſſe the Prophet calleth them to faſting and weeping, and telleth them, <hi>that the Lord is gracious and merciful, and ready to forgive; and who knoweth if he will return, and repent, and leave a bleſſing behind him?</hi> Therefore let us do our parts, and ſeek God in truth, amend our lives, and then no queſtion of this, but that God will return.</p>
               <p>It is an old device of Sathan, to draw men, inſtead of Gods revealed will, to look to Gods ſecret will: whether I be abſolutely rejected or caſt off or not. But this is not the thought wherein a Chriſtian ſhould exerciſe himſelfe: his main buſineſs is this, to make his calling and election ſure, by all the evidences of it; hy a holy life: walk obediently to Gods revealed will, and be certain thou ſhalt not be rejected by Gods ſecret will. He never rejecteth thoſe by his ſecret will, and purpoſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, to whom he giveth a heart to walk obediently to his revealed will. So much for that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who knoweth that the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The incouragement is this: <hi>That the child may live.</hi> But mark his expreſſion, <hi>Whether the Lord will be gratious to</hi> [<hi>me</hi>] <hi>that the child may live.</hi> If he had ſaid no more but this, <hi>Who knoweth whether the child may live?</hi> A man would have thought this would fully enough have expreſſed his mind, but there is more in it that could not be expreſſed without this addition, <hi>Who knoweth whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The life of a child is a mercy to the father, <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth herein both his Pitty, and his Piety.</p>
               <p>His pitty;
<note place="margin">Obſerve firſt Davids piety</note> He accounteth all the good or ill that befalleth his child, as his own if death befalleth it, he accounteth it as a miſery that befalleth himſelf: if ſickneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falleth his child, he accounteth it as an affliction upon himſelf. This is his natural pitty, that ſome natural affection of a father to his Child. See ſuch an expreſſion of the woman of <hi>Canaan;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat 15 22.</note> 
                  <hi>have mercy on me, thou ſon of David, my daughter is miſerably vexed of a divel.</hi> The Daughter was miſerably vexed, and the mother cryeth out, <hi>Have mercy on me,</hi> There is ſuch a ſimpathy ariſeth hence from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and free courſe that love hath in deſcending from the Father to the Child. There are not only moral perſwaſions that may invite and draw on love, but beſides that, there is a courſe of affection, that floweth naturally, and kindly, from the Father to the child: as it is with thoſe rivers that fall downward, they fall more vehenently then thoſe that are carried upward: ſo the more natural the affection is, the more vehement it expreſſeth it ſelf in the motion to ſuch objects. Now when the Father expreſſeth his affection to his child, this is more vehement, becauſe it is more natural, there is more ſtrength of nature in it.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſtand upon this, only a word by way of inference, and application to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Firſt;
<note place="margin">Comfort to Gods children.</note> are natural parents thus to their children? Then here is a ground of faith for the children of God, that he is pleaſed to ſtile himſelf by the name of Father, and to receive them into the adoption of ſons and daughters. This was <hi>Davids</hi> expreſſion of God. <hi>As a father hath compaſſion of his children, ſo hath the Lord on thoſe that fear him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 103.</note> And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> expreſſeth it fully: <hi>In all their affliction,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.9.</note> he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſenſe ſaved them; in his love and pitty he redeemed them, and he bare them all the dayes of old, he bore them upon his wings.</hi> This giveth confidence, and boldneſs to Gods children, in making their requeſts known to him. This was it that incouraged the Prodigal; <hi>I will ariſe and go to my father, and ſay, Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven and bofore thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Barnard</hi>) <hi>alwayes grants thoſe petitions that are ſweetned with the name of father, and the affection of a child.</hi> I ſhould hence ſpeak ſomewhat to children, to ſtir them up to anſwer the love of their Parents; but other things that follow forbids me any long diſcourſe of this.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Obſerve <hi>Davids</hi> piety.</note> here is <hi>Davids</hi> piety expreſſed in this, <hi>Who knoweth whether the Lord <pb n="66" facs="tcp:47453:40"/>will be gracious to me?</hi> He expreſt not only the Pitty and affection of a natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a child, but piety alſo, ariſing from the ſenſe of his guilt. He was guilty of ſin, and by ſin he had brought this ſorrow upon himſelf, and therefore <hi>who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whether the Lord will be gracious to me,</hi> in ſealing to me the pardon of my ſin this way, in adding this mercy as a further aſſurance of his love, in granting me the forgiveneſs of my ſin. God had told him by <hi>Nathan,</hi> that his ſin was pardoned, though he told him the Child ſhould die: it may be by the ſame mercy he will releaſe me from this ſentence of death upon my Child, whereby he releaſed me from the guilt of my ſin before. Here (I ſay) is the ſenſe of his own ſin.</p>
               <p>The point I note hence is;
<note place="margin">Parents in their childrens miſeries ſhould remember their own ſins. 1. King. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>That Parents in the miſeries that befal their children, ſhould call their own ſin to remembrance.</hi> All the ſorrows, and ſickneſſes, and pains, and miſeries that befall children, ſhould preſent to Parents the remembrance of their own ſin. It was the expreſſion of the Widdow of <hi>Sar epta</hi> to the Prophet <hi>Eliah; Art thou come to call my ſins to remembrance, and to ſlay my child?</hi> She ſaw her ſin in the death of her Child; So I ſay in all the afflictions and croſſes that befall children, the Parents ſhould call to remembrance their own ſin.</p>
               <p>But ſome men will here ſay;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Deut. 24.16.</note> There ſeemeth to be no need of ſuch a courſe, for God hath ſaid plainly, <hi>That the child ſhall not die for the ſin of the Parent.</hi> And after God cleareth his own waies from inequality and injuſtice by that argument, <hi>The ſon ſhall not bear the iniquity of the father.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 18.20.</note> Therefore what reaſon is there that Parents ſhould call their ſins to remembrance, in the miſeries that befall there children?</p>
               <p>I anſwer;
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Though he ſay, <hi>the child ſhall not die</hi> for the Parents ſin, yet we muſt underſtand it aright, for what doth he mean by the ſins of the Parent? And what doth he mean by death?</p>
               <p>By ſins of the Parent, he meaneth thoſe ſins that are ſo the Parents, as that the children are not at all guilty of thoſe ſins: then the children ſhall not die.</p>
               <p>By Death, he meaneth (as the word ſignifieth) the deſtruction of nature.</p>
               <p>So death ſhall not befall the child for that ſin that himſelf is not guilty of.</p>
               <p>But how then come little children to die before they have committed any ſin actually?
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note> was this for their own ſin, or for the ſin of their Parents?</p>
               <p>I anſwer,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> for their own ſin they die, <hi>for the ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die,</hi> and all children have ſinned: they brought ſin into the world, <hi>and ſin brought death</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>therefore death reigneth over all, even over thoſe that have not ſinned according to the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion;</hi> that is, that have not ſinned actually as <hi>Adam</hi> had done, yet nevertheleſs they die becauſe they have ſin upon them, they have the corruption of nature: <hi>In ſin they were born, and in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity their mother conceived them, and the wages of ſin is death:</hi> therefore they die for their own ſin.</p>
               <p>But what if temporal judgments and afflictions befall them,
<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> is this for their own ſin, or for the ſin of their Parents?</p>
               <p>I anſwer for both;
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> both for their own, and for the ſin of their Parents: for as death, ſo all the miſeries of this life are fruits of original ſin, which is an inheritance in the perſon of every child by nature, as ſoon as it is born: but yet if the ſin of the Parents be added to it, that may bring temporall judgments. There are many inſtances and examples of this, how God hath viſited upon the poſterity of wicked perſons, the ſins of their Fathers, according to that threatning in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. And this you ſhall ſee, either in godly children of wicked parents, or in ungodly children of godly Parents. Suppoſe a man leave a great deal of wealth to his children, and have one that fears God amongſt them: it may pleaſe God to lay ſome loſſe or croſſe upon him, to the undoing of him, he may utterly be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, and beggered, and deprived of all that means that his father left him by unrighteouſneſs; <hi>He getteth an heir, and in his hand is nothing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) that <pb n="67" facs="tcp:47453:40"/>is, God deprived him of all that eſtate his father left him by unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, here is a judgment upon the father, and yet a mercy upon the child. A judgment upon the father, that all that he hath laboured for, that which he loſt his ſoul for, ſhould be vain, ſhould come to nothing, and not benefit his poſterity as he thought. Yet it is a mercy to the child, to the child of God; He by this means is humbled, it draweth him from the world; Nay, when God emptieth him of theſe things that were unrighteouſly gotten, he giveth him (it may be) an eſtate another way, wherein he ſhall ſee God his Father provide for him without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct and unlawful courſes.</p>
               <p>So ſometimes the very ſhame and reproach that falleth upon wicked children here, it is a judgment to the parents, and to the children too. Upon the parent, as far as he is guilty of the neglect of his duty, and of evil example, and the like, ſo he is puniſhed in the ſhame that befalleth his poſterity. As it is a bleſſing upon a man <hi>that he is not aſhamed to ſit in the Gates</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) no man can upbraid him with his children;
<note place="margin">Pro. 31.</note> So it is a correction to Gods children, even when their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren prove ungodly, ſo farr as they have been negligent, and careleſs of their duty. This was the caſe of old <hi>Eli,</hi> a good man, yet nevertheleſs the hand of God was gone out againſt his houſe and family, and what was the reaſon of it? <hi>Becauſe thou honoureſt thy ſons above me, they made themſelves vile,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam 2 29 chap. 3.12.13</note> 
                  <hi>and thou reſtraineſt them not, therefore will I bring a judgment upon thy houſe, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it ſhall tingle.</hi> I ſay it may come to paſs (and that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that natural affection that is in Parents) that that miſery that befalleth their children, may be an exceeding croſs and an affliction to them. God layes ſharp corrections on them, when he makes thoſe children which they accounted as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and the hope of their life, to be the very croſs, and vexation of their life.</p>
               <p>There is then ye ſee, ſuch a courſe of Gods dealing with men, to viſit the ſins of the Fathers upon the children: that is, if the children walk in their fathers ſteps if the child and the father agree in a courſe of ſin: if the father by omiſſion or commiſſion make himſelf guilty of the ſin of the child, &amp;c. and ſo if the child, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by imintation, or allowance go on in his fathers way, he draweth a greater judgment upon himſelf, by adding to his fathers ſin: and as they are alike in ſin, ſo they ſhall be alike in judgment.</p>
               <p>You ſee likewiſe for temporal judgments, that God may, and often-times doth lay many ſickneſſes, and croſſes upon the children, for the ſin of their parents, that they may be ſmitten by the judgment that is upon their children, and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the children may be free from ſin, <hi>for who ever was afflicted being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is this ſo?
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To parents. The ſins that bring judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon mens poſterity.</note> then in the firſt place it ſhould teach Parents to take heed of making themſelves miſerable in their poſterity by ſinning againſt God.</p>
               <p>There are ſpecially three ſorts of ſins in Scripture, for which God continueth his judgments upon mens poſterities and families.</p>
               <p>The firſt are, ſins againſt the firſt Table, againſt the worſhip of God, Idolatry, and ſuch like; for theſe God ſmiteth mens poſterities, as we may ſee in <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and others; And ſo the neglect of dutie, prophaneſs and negligence in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: <hi>Let thy wrath come upon the heathen, and on the families that call not upon thy name.</hi> A family I know, in a large ſenſe, ſignifieth a Nation, but in a ſtrict ſence a family, or poſterity; in that place it ſignifieth both. A Family or people, that lay aſide the worſhip of God, and the ſanctifying of his Name, thoſe that lie under this charge of not <hi>calling upon the name of God: let thy wrath come upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort of ſins, are thoſe againſt the ſecond Table, unrighteouſneſs, injuſtice, uncleanneſs, and the like: for thoſe ſins God viſiteth mens poſterities, puniſheth them in their children: ſometime by taking them away, ſometimes by ſmiting them with ſuch ſickneſſes, and temporal afflictions, and chaſtiſements, as Parents have continual matter of ſorrow, and humiliation, and calling their ſins to mind; The Scripture is full of inſtances of this kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:47453:41"/>
Thirdly, for the neglect of duty to their children, when Parents are too fond and remiſs in their education, and careleſs in their duty: therefore <hi>Job</hi> was fearful of this, leſt his ſons ſhould ſin againſt God, and he was continually in prayer, that God would keep them in his fear. Parents, if they would have a bleſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued on their poſterity, they ſhould be careful of ſanctifying their Families, by the worſhip of God, and by their <hi>walking with an upright heart in the midſt of their houſe,</hi> by dealing righteouſly with men in all their buſineſs, not to ſtrive to rear their poſterity by wealth, but by grace, to leave them heirs of the b<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, rather then of much money. That is the way to have comfort in children and poſterity.</p>
               <p>Ye ſee how few of thoſe that in this Citie, or other places that have got ſuch wealth, thrive in many generations, nay, it may be not in the next generation, but come ſome to notorious beggary in the ſight of others, that others may be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how they get eſtates by unjuſtice and unrighteouſneſs, to leave to their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. There is the judgment of God going along with unrighteous gain, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life, and falleth upon poſterity, as far as they approve of, or walk in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers waies.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place it ſhould teach children to take heed of the ſinful courſes of their Parents,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. To children.</note> if they will not joyn with them in their puniſhment; nay, if they will not have the increaſe of their puniſhment, take heed, I ſay take heed of going on in their ſins. Remember the charge that the Lord gave concerning <hi>Babylon, Come out of her if you will not partake of her Plagues:</hi> if we will not partake of their plagues, take heed of partaking in the ſins of your Parents.</p>
               <p>Here was <hi>Davids</hi> piety, he calleth his ſins to remembrence. So ought Parents in all croſſes that befal their families or poſterity, if any child be ſick or weak, or if their be any croſs in their eſtates, or trade, or ſucceſs in their buſineſs, whereby they ſhould maintain their Families, to call their own ſins to remembrance, to look o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſeveral commands of God, to ſee what ſins they are guilty of, that they have not yet repented of.</p>
               <p>Now we come to <hi>Davids</hi> carriage,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Davdis</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage when his child was dead.</note> when the child was dead. <hi>But now he is dead, wherefore ſhould I faſt: Can I bring him back again? I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not return to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here ye have <hi>Davids</hi> carriage,
<note place="margin">The reaſons of it.</note> and the reaſons why he did not faſt. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was againſt reaſon, <hi>wherefore ſhould I faſt?</hi> in this expreſſion, he impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he ſaw no reaſon for it, and that made him forbear it. Secondly, it is altogether bootleſs and needleſs; <hi>Can I bring him back again?</hi> Thirdly, <hi>I ſhall go to him:</hi> I have ſomewhat elſe to do, then to ſpend my time in unprofitable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, there is a matter that concerneth me more neerly to think upon, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my own death, to prepare for that. And Laſtly, the laſt reaſon is, <hi>He ſhall not returne to me.</hi> Theſe are the reaſons of the alteration of his carriage upon the death of the child.</p>
               <p>Concerning ſorrow for the dead, ye muſt underſtand it of exceſſive ſorrow. Here is not forbidden a due meaſure of ſorrow, that is allowed; but he ſpeaks of ſorrow in the exceſs. Why ſhould I do this?</p>
               <p>The reaſons he giveth againſt exceſſive ſorrow, are firſt (I can but give you the heads of things) becauſe it is a thing againſt reaſon. Hence I will note this to you;<lb/>
                  <hi>That one way to moderate our ſorrows,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervation from the firſt reaſon.</note> 
                  <hi>and to regulate them aright, is to bring them to the examination of reaſon and judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When paſſions ſway, when they do not look to the commands of reaſon, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and ordered according to that, but uſurp a rule in the ſoul above reaſon, then there is nothing but confuſion, and diſtemper, and diſorder, in a mans afections &amp; acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in his whole courſe. A man ſhould therefore conſider, what reaſon there is for every thing. If he ſorrow for a thing, what reaſon have I for it? If he rejoyce in any thing, what reaſon have I for it? Is it worth this ſorrow, or this joy? I ſay 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47453:41"/>
his is the way to rectifie and moderate our paſſions, and to order them aright, if we trie them all by ſound reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> took this courſe at other times, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, oh my ſoul, why art thon diſquicted within me?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 44.</note> Is there any good reaſon for it? Reaſon I ſay, is a curb and bridle, to ſtop paſſion when it is running on its free courſe.</p>
               <p>If <hi>David</hi> had done thus, would he have run out to that exceſſive expreſſion for his ſon? <hi>Oh Abſolom, my ſon, my ſow,</hi> &amp;c. What great reaſon had he for this? that <hi>Abſolom</hi> a rebellious ſon was took away that ſought the death of his Father; that God glorified himſelf in the puniſhment of a diſobedient, proud, inſolent child in the ſight of all the world? Was this a matter for <hi>David</hi> ſo much to grieve, and to be troubled at?</p>
               <p>If <hi>Jonah</hi> had done thus, if he had conſidered what reaſon he had to be angry; (as GOD putteth the queſtion to him; <hi>doſt thou well to be angry?</hi>) Would he not have ſtopped that Paſſion?</p>
               <p>If <hi>Cain</hi> had done thus; if he had put the queſtion to himſelf as GOD did, <hi>Why art thou wrath? why is thy conntenance fallen?</hi> Or as that great King ſaid to <hi>Nehemiah, Why is thy countenance ſad?</hi> So if men would put the queſtion to themſelves concerning their affections: as, concerning love, why do I ſet my heart upon ſuch and ſuch things? and ſo likewiſe concerning their ſorrow and anger, and every thing, Why is it thus? As <hi>Rebecca</hi> ſaid when the children did ſtrive in her womb, ſo when there is a conflict of paſſion in the ſoul againſt reaſon, ſince it is ſo, <hi>why am I thus? Who art thou that feareſt mortal man?</hi> ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to the Church. If men I ſay did thus, they would not break out into ſuch exorbitancy of paſſions, as commonly they do.</p>
               <p>The way then to order any affection aright,
<note place="margin">The way to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections is to reduce them to the principles of rectified reaſon.</note> is to reduce it to the principles of ſanctified, and rectified reaſon and judgement. Let reaſon be guided by the Word of GOD, and let the affections be ordered by that reaſon ſo rectified. Thus it was with man in the ſtate of innocency; and experience telleth us, that in the ſtate of corruption, all diſorder cometh from the want of this ſubordination of the affections, to reaſon in their ſeveral actions and motions. When a man goes hood-wink'd up and down, he is in danger of ſtumbling, and falling into one hole or other: this is for a man to <hi>walk in darkneſſe:</hi> then a man-walketh in darkneſſe, when he is not guided in all his actions and affections, by the light of truth ſhining in his underſtanding. A man ſhould therefore ſtrive to check himſelf, and to ſuffer others to check him, Why is it thus? If a man cannot give a cauſe and a reaſon, it is a paſſion to be rejected, a diſtemper o be repented of. This is the firſt thing; He ſaw no reaſon, therefore he would not do it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this. It was altogether bootleſſe, <hi>Why ſhould I faſt? I cannot bring him back again.</hi> He meaneth, bring him back again to live on the earth. So <hi>Job</hi> meaneth,
<note place="margin">Job 14.14.</note> when he ſpeaks in the ſame manner, <hi>If a man die, ſhall he live again?</hi> he cannot be brought again to live, and converſe among men.</p>
               <p>The point I note hence is this.<lb/>
                  <hi>That all the actions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervation from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon.</note> 
                  <hi>and opportunities of this life ceaſe in death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no calling of them back again. No bringing of a man back to take new opportunities, to enioy the comforts he hath loſt, and to make uſe of the means he hath neglected, and to redeem the time he hath ſlackly let paſſe. When the requeſt was put to <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Dives,</hi> that ſome might <hi>come from the dead</hi> to tell his brethren upon earth where he was: No, faith he, that requeſt ſhall never be granted, that a man ſhould come from the dead, to give warning to the living, much leſſe that a man himſelf ſhould return from thence, to begin upon a new ſcore, a new reckoning, to have a new time appointed, when that time is paſt over: <hi>They have Moſes, and the Prophetes, let them hear them.</hi> God hath appointed the means, and a time to uſe the means; <hi>Now they have Moſes and the Prophets;</hi> After this life, they ſhall have none of theſe means, no time of uſing them; <hi>The child <pb n="70" facs="tcp:47453:42"/>ſhall not come back again,</hi> nor the man ſhall not come back again. Death is a ſtrict door-keeper, all that paſſe out that way, the door is ſhut on them, they ſhall never return back. We read of many ſeveral Ages that have gone to the place of ſilence, we never read of any that came thence, to tell what is done there: we never heard of any yet, that came back again to reform his courſe. A friend with all his prayers and tears, cannot bring back a friend that is dead.</p>
               <p>It teacheth us a point of wiſdom to make good uſe of our time,
<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> the time of grace we have. We draw neerer death every day then other, and when once we are dead, we ſhall never be brought back again upon the earth; If a man had all the world, and would give it to obtain an hours time upon earth, to do what he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected before, he cannot have it: therefore <hi>while it is called to day, harden not your hearts: yet a little while and you ſhall have the light</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>while ye have the light, walk in the light;</hi> Make uſe of the means of grace: the time may come, when ye may wiſh (as <hi>Dives</hi> is deſcribed to wiſh) that ſome body, much more that you your ſelves might come from the dead.</p>
               <p>Certainly, if thoſe in Hell were to come from the dead again, though it were to live a hundred years on earth, a holy, ſtrict, and concionable life, to watch over all their wayes, to keep a good conſcience towards God and men, they would not omit a duty, nor ſlight a duty, they would not omit an opportunity, a minute, but ſpend their whole life in <hi>working out their ſalvations with fear and trembling,</hi> they would ſleep and awake with fear, leſt they ſhould ſin, they would be careful that they had no ſinful thought, they would be patterns of the ſtrangeſt expreſſions of conformity to the rule that can be imagined, if it were poſſible to be granted. You may eaſily be perſwaded of this, do you that now which they wiſh for, and wiſh in vain: make uſe of the time of grace now, there is no coming back again after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. A third reaſon is this; <hi>I ſhall go to him.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, I have another buſineſs in hand, now the child is dead, it is not for me to ſtand blubbering, and ſpending my time for a dead Child; I am going to him. The word here is, <hi>I ſhall return to him.</hi> Return ſignifieth, to go back to a place where one was before; So <hi>David</hi> ſhall return to his Child: for he was there before; there, in reſpect of his body,
<note place="margin">Encleſ. 1 2.</note> the principles of that is in the earth where the Child is, and in heaven in reſpect of his ſoul where the Child is: <hi>The Body returneth to duſt whence it was taken, and the ſoul to God that gave it.</hi> The body is of the duſt, and returneth to duſt, the ſoul cometh from God, and returns to God again. Therefore he ſaith here, I ſhall return to him, becauſe I came from him. When things are reduced to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the body to the earth, and the ſoul to God, they are ſaid to return. Ye ſee the phraſe then.</p>
               <p>The point (briefly) is this;<lb/>
                  <hi>That the greateſt care of a mans life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervation from the third reaſon.</note> 
                  <hi>the greateſt buſineſs he hath to do on earth, is to prepare for death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His buſineſs is not to care for his children that are dead, and to ſpend unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſorrow for them: the main buſineſs of my life is, how I ſhall make my peace with God, and be fitted for death, for I am going thither. We ſhould obſerve the death of others, to ſtir us up to a ſerious preparation for our own death: the Father ſhould be ſtirred up by ſeeing his Child dead before him, the elder by ſeeing the younger die before them: we ſee how death hath ſhot his arrowes beyond, and ſhort, and above, and below us, in thoſe that are elder, and younger, and richer and poorer, all forts, he will ſtrike us at laſt: this thing (I ſay) ſhould ſtirr us up to prepare for our own diſſolution.</p>
               <p>A man would think that there were no need of ſuch a thing; the very bare ſight of a Corſe, or a Hearſe, the bare ſight of a deed corpſe, the bare ringing of a bell, or a <hi>Funeral Sermon,</hi> ſhould be warning enough to the living to tell him of death. When a man ſees a company carrying a dead body to the grave; he ſhould ſay to himſelf; <hi>It may be the feet of theſe may carry me next.</hi> But how cometh it to paſs hat it is not thus?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:47453:42"/>
Certainly, there is not power in all examples to work this: it is the work of Gods ſpirit. Though a man obſerve the death of never ſo many before him, yet his cannot work in him a ſerious care, to make preparation for his own death, except God adde a further work to it. We may ſee this in the expreſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when ſo many died in the Wilderneſs: <hi>Lord teach us to number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts to wiſdom.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Though ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands died in the Wilderneſs, and that by ſo many ſeveral kinds of death, yet we ſhall never apply our hearts to wiſdom by thoſe examples, except God teach us that wiſdom. Therefore we ſhould pray to God to teach us by his Spirit, to make uſe of Examples. Men muſt give account for examples aſ well as for rules; men muſt give account for examples of mortality, as well as for Sermons of mortality: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the example of others mortality ſtir you up to prepare for your own, and that you may do ſo, be much in calling upon God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly;
<note place="margin">Obſervation from the fouth reaſon.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhall not return to me:</hi> that is in this ſenſe, to converſe on earth, as he had done before; <hi>I ſhall return to him, but he ſhall not return to me.</hi> He doth but reitterate, and repeat what he had ſaid before in effect.</p>
               <p>This is the thing then that Parents muſt make account of, both for themſelves and their children.</p>
               <p>For their children. It ſhould make them moderate therefore in their ſorrow for them. God now hath ſhewed his purpoſe, and declared his will, therefore we ſhould reſt in that will of God. This is the thing that <hi>David</hi> aymed at. Gods will was not only to take away his child, but ſo to take him away, as never to return to him again in that manner; Now God had declared his will, and therefore, <hi>Why ſhould I fast</hi> (ſaith he,) as if he ſhould ſay, I will now reſt in the will of God.</p>
               <p>In all the things which we account croſſes, and loſſes, in children and friends, &amp;c. The main buſineſs of a chriſtian, is not to expreſſe ſorrow, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and ſubiection to God, to exerciſe and inure his heart to patience, and to reſt in Gods good pleaſure and will. As <hi>Eli,</hi> though he failed in his carriage to his ſons, yet he ſhewed a dutiful reſpect to God his heavenly father. When <hi>Samuel</hi> told him the judgement of God that ſhould come upon his houſe. <hi>It is the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let him do what ſeemeth him good in his own eyes:</hi> though it were a heavy judgement, ſuch as <hi>whoſoever ſhould hear of it, both his eares ſhould tingle, yet it is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him goad.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; I have nothing to do in this buſineſs, but to ſubject my ſelf with patient ſubmiſſion, and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his will, it is the Lord, it becometh not me to contend with him, and to reaſon with God concerning his work, I confeſs <hi>he is righteous, let him do what ſee meth him good in his own eyes.</hi> And ſo <hi>Aaron.</hi> There was a heavy judgement befallen him, his ſons were conſumed with fire; yet, the text ſaith, <hi>Aaron held his peace.</hi> When God manifeſted ſo great wrath to his houſe, in waſting, and conſuming, and burning his ſons, for offering of ſtrange fire, yet <hi>Aaron held his peace;</hi> that is, he did only mind how to glorifie God by a contented ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his will. So <hi>Job,</hi> he heard not only of the loſſe of his children, but that he loſt them in ſuch a manner by a violent death, by a houſe falling on their heads, <hi>yet the Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> Whereas a carnal worldly man would have fallen to ſtrugling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, and quarrelling againſt God, and ſo trouble and perplex his own ſpirit. We do exceedingly imbitter Gods cup, by mingling with it ingredients of our own paſſions, and ſo make the affliction more heavy and grievous then God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it. Here is the reaſon: <hi>we poſſeſs</hi> not <hi>our ſouls with Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we are ſenſible of the loſſe of friends and children, &amp;c. let us learn to make it our buſineſs, to think, I have a greater work to do, to prepare for my own death. God in the death of this man ſpeaks to me to prepare for my own; And then to glorifie God by ſubmiſſion to his will, make it appear that thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeſt a power in God to diſpoſe of thy houſe, to do every thing, by patiently reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:47453:43"/>
And yet this comfort is added, though children be took away that they ſhall not return in an earthly manner, yet they ſhall in a better manner. Parents are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to part with their children for a time for their preferment. Children (though they are very young) that are commended by the prayers of the godly Parents into the hands of God; theſe whoſe hearts God hath inlarged, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fervently and faithfully to pray in the beſalf of their children, they may reſt in this aſſured, that they ſhall meet at the Reſurrection in a better manner, their children ſhall be better preferred then if they were on earth, and ſhall be raiſed up to perfection.</p>
               <p>Here you ſee there is not a tooth bred in a child without a great deal of pain, and every tooth coſt ſome pain, but this <hi>mortal body ſhall put on immortality, and this corruption ſhall put on incorruption;</hi> This weak body ſhall be made ſtrong, weak children ſtrong without pain. Death endeth theſe things, and the Reſurrection ſhall preſent him in a perfect meaſure of ſtrength in a glorified eſtate. </p>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Olomon</hi> telleth thus,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>that there is a ſeaſon for every thing, there is a time to be born, and a time to die:</hi> Theſe two are the two great ſeaſons of all men, we are as ſure to die, as we are ſure we have lived, and every degree of our life, is but a ſtep to our death. Every man of us hath but a part to act here in the world, when we have done that that God hath appointed us, we are drawn off from the Stage by Death.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, this is a hard condition for ſo Noble a creature as Man is to be folded up in the grave, for ſo fair a beauty as the life of man is, to be cloſed up in eternal darkneſs, that man ſhould turn to the acquaintance of duſt and worms, and make his habitation with rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and loathſomeneſs, that Death ſhould have the victory of ſo excellent a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is a hard condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:47453:44"/>
The Apoſtle thinks not ſo,
<note place="margin">Coherence.</note> he thinks otherwiſe, <hi>Death</hi> (faith he, ver. 54.) <hi>is ſwallowed up in victory;</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, It need not trouble you to think ſo of Death, the condition of it is not ſo ſtrange and hard as men take it to be; <hi>It is ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> If a man have a ſtrong enemy to deal with, it might trouble him, but it is no great matter to deal with a conquered enemy: Chriſt hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Death, hath conquered that ſtrong enemy, <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the precedent, and ſubſequent verſes of this Chapter, ſeemeth to inſult and triumph over Death, <hi>Oh Death</hi> (faith he) <hi>where is thy ſting? Oh grave where is thy victory?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, before Chriſt came and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered thee, Death thou wert victorious; ſo it was. there was a ſting in it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſweetned the grave, there was ſomething that was terrible in the Grave, but now becauſe Chriſt is come, and hath gotten the victory over the one, and ſweetned the other, therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> breaks forth thus into an inſultation and triumph.</p>
               <p>But, how can this be? Why doth the Apoſtle thus triumph?</p>
               <p>The reaſon is inſinuated in the verſe I have read to you, <hi>the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is the occaſion of trouble to Chriſtians?</p>
               <p>No, it is not, <hi>thanks be to God, that hath given us victory through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I will ſhew you the reaſon, of my triumphing over Death, there was a ſting in Sin, and Sin is the ſting of Death, and the Law is the ſtrength of ſin, but Chriſt hath took away ſin, and hath ſatisfied the Law, ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, Death cannot hurt me, the Law being ſatisfied, Sin cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiceme. This was the cauſe of the Apoſtle, and in him of every Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation over Death.</p>
               <p>The words I have read contain two parts;
<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt the ſting of Death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſtrength of Sin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>ſting of death, is ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>the ſtrength of ſin, is the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there were no law, there would be no ſin, and if there were no ſin, there would be no death: <hi>Sin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law, and ſin is the ſting of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall only at this time inſiſt upon the firſt of theſe, from whence I ſhall deliver that, which if it pleaſe God to accompany with his Spirit, may be uſeful to you.</p>
               <p>The propoſition ſhall be the very words of the Text.<lb/>
                  <q>Sin is the ſting of death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Propoſition I would not have you underſtaud in this ſenſe only,
<note place="margin">

But underſtand it in this ſenſe, That all the horrour and terribleneſs of Death, all the power and rage it hath, whatſoever makes it fearful to a man, it receiveth it all from ſin. It is ſin that armeth Death againſt a man, if Death have any weapons againſt a man, Sin puts thoſe weapons into the hands of Death; if Death have any poyſon againſt a Chriſtian, the ſin of that perſon putteth that poyſon in it.</p>
               <p>Death may be conſidered two wayes,
<note place="margin">A double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of death.</note> either as Chriſt hath made it, or as we make it.</p>
               <p>Death as Chriſt hath made it, is a medicine to a Chriſtian, a paſſage and entrance to happineſs, it is a day of redemption and refreſhing, and ſo we need not be afraid of it.</p>
               <p>Death as we by ſin have made it, is the Pale horſe Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, it is as a fearful arreſt to the debtor, it hath a ſting in it: and ſo it is feareful.</p>
               <p>But that I may open this point more profitably, we will inquire into theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:47453:44"/>
Firſt what death the Apoſtle ſpeaks of here.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of what ſin he ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in what reſpect ſin is called the ſting of death. And then we will make the uſe and application of all this.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">What death is here meant.</note> of what death doth the Apoſtle here ſpeak of, that ſin is the ſting of?</p>
               <p>For anſwer hereunto, there is a double death, corporal and ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>Corporal death, is the privation of the ſoul: when the ſoul is ſevered from the body.</p>
               <p>Spiritual death, when God and grace are ſevered from the ſoul.</p>
               <p>The Text ſpeaks of the corporal death.
<note place="margin">Corporall death. Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally.</note> Sin is not the ſting of the ſpiritual death, for the ſpiritual death is ſin it ſelf. And hear I will not contend with any man, if he be full of enquiry, but I will diſtinguiſh two parts of ſpiritual death, and I grant in one of them is this ſting.</p>
               <p>In ſpiritual death therefore,
<note place="margin">Two parts of ſpiritual death.</note> there are two parts, or two degrees; The firſt is called, the firſt death; That I take to be the death of the ſoul in ſin.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part is when ſoul and body are for ever cloſed up in Hell. And in this part, ſin is the ſting; And remember this by the way, Sin is not only a ſting now, but it will be a ſting to men in Hell: the ſting, the deadlineſs, the exreamity of puniſhment that is in Hell, it is received all from ſin: for the damned in Hell, when they come there, as they ceaſe not to ſin, ſo the ſting of ſin ceaſeth not to be with them: and it may be delivered by conjecture, I think Hell were no Hell, if there were not the ſting of ſin there.</p>
               <p>So then you ſee what death the Apoſtle ſpeaks of: principally of corporal death, but it may be extended to the ſecond part of ſpiritual death, for their ſin continueth and ſo the ſting remaineth.</p>
               <p>The next queſtion is, what ſin the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, when he faith, <hi>the ſting of death is ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is not a time to ſtir controverſies, therefore thoſe ancient controverſies, and ſuch as are lately ſtirred up about original ſin, how far it is the ſting of death, I let them go.</p>
               <p>In a word,
<note place="margin">What ſin is the ſting of Death Sin two wayes conſidered.</note> to let you ſee what ſin is the <hi>ſting of death,</hi> remember this. Sin may be conſidered two wayes, either as it is intire, untouched, uncruſhed. Let that ſin be what it will be, whether it be original only, or whether it be any actual ſin, ſtreaming from original, whether it be a ſin of ignorance or knowledg, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of pleaſure or of profit; A ſin immediately that reſpecteth God, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madiately reſpecteth our neighbour, whatſoever the ſin be, if it be not touched, if it be not cruſhed, if it ſcape uncontrouled, if it be in its native power, and keeps in his kingdome, if it rule in a man; that ſin will certainly be the ſting of Death. Every ſin vertually is <hi>the ſting of death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sin unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied proves the ſting of death.</note> there is an aptitude in every Sin, but in the event that ſin proveth <hi>the ſting of death,</hi> that is untouched, uncontrouled. Not every ſin in the event proveth the <hi>ſting of death;</hi> but that ſin that liveth in us, or rather that ſin that we live in, that ruleth in us, that we affect, and love, this is the Sin that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a <hi>ſting into death.</hi> That very ſin that thou loveſt, and likeſt ſo much, and pleadeſt for, that ſin will make death terrible.</p>
               <p>Secondly; Sin may be conſidered as it is galled, and vexed, and mortified in the Soul; When a man ſetteth upon the root of Sin, and the way of Sin, and falleth a crucifying the body of Sin, and the members of it, I ſay, howſoever there be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers motions and ſtirrings of Sin in the ſoul; yet if theſe be diſavowed, diſaffected, and mortified, if there be a crucifying vertue, paſs over them, if they come not within the judgment to approve them, or within the affections to embrace and like them; if they come not to be a mans trade, and way, and walk, but fall within the improbation of the judgment to diſavow them, and the miſliking of the affections to ſorrow for them: Theſe ſhall not be the <hi>ſting of death,</hi> whatſoever the motions are; But theſe untouched, unmortified ſins, theſe are the <hi>ſting of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe are the <hi>ſting of death,</hi> in a double reſpect; Firſt, in reſpect of the guilt; Secondly, in reſpect of the corruption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:47453:45"/>
Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. In reſpect of the guilt.</note> they are a <hi>ſting</hi> in reſpect of guilt. Every Sin remaining unſatisfied for, remaineth with his guilt, and when Sin is not ſatisfied for, there is the <hi>ſting of death.</hi> When the ſinner hath nothing to oppoſe to the juſtice of God, for the ſin he hath committed, if the Sin be in the book of God uncroſſed, be a debt there not blotted out by the blood of Chriſt; if Chriſt have not ſatisfied for it, if the ſinner have not part in him (as we ſhall hear anon) then Sin is the <hi>ſting of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then ſecondly,
<note place="margin">2. In reſpect of the filth.</note> they are a ſting in reſpect of the corruption, and filthineſs of Sins unmortified. Thoſe filthy ſinful motions, thoſe depraving qualities in thy ſoul that thou likeſt, and practifeſt in thy converſation, they give thee up into the hand of Death, to execute his Sting upon thee; And therefore you that applaud your ſelves in ſin, and will go on in Sin, do ſo; But know this, when thou comeſt to the full ſtrength of thy Sin, let it be what it will, when Death cometh, it findeth the ſtrongeſt weapon it hath in thy ſin: the very power of thy ſin armeth Death againſt thy ſoul. No man is more obnoxious, and open to the ſharpeſt dart of Death, then that man that will go on in Sin.</p>
               <p>So you ſee what Sin is ſpoken of, that is <hi>the ſting of death,</hi> that Sin is the <hi>ſting of Death,</hi> that a man loveth and doteth on.</p>
               <p>The third Queſtion is,
<note place="margin">How ſin is ſaid to be the ſting of Death.</note> in what reſpect <hi>Sin is the ſting of Death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt by way of Eminencie, becauſe that then the ſting of Sin beginneth moſt ſenſibly to work in a man. Not but that Sin hath a <hi>ſting</hi> before Death, but then the deluded ſinner feels his ſin; there be divers times that Sin can ſting a perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, but then (howſoever the ſinner hath deluded himſelfe, and the word of God, and the world) he can delude them no more, Death then (moſt ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſixeth his <hi>ſting</hi> in the ſoul, and makes the ſinner feel the ſmart of his ſin.</p>
               <p>There be three times wherein Sin can ſting a man;
<list>
                     <item>Before death.</item>
                     <item>At death.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Before Death.
<note place="margin">Sin ſtings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death.</note> God ſometimes letteth looſe the conſcience of a man, even of the moſt reſolved ſinner, of him that bears himſelfe up aloſt in his own eyes in ſcrone, and contempt of the miniſtry of the Word: ſometime (I ſay) God ſingleth out ſuch a perſon, and rippeth up all his heart, ſtrikes his Arrows into his very ſoul, and ſtings his conſcience ſo irreſiſtably, that he knoweth not which way to turne form the wrath that boyleth in his ſoul. And it is one thing to deal with the Miniſter, and another to deal with God; When God ſtrikes his <hi>Arrows</hi> of vengeance into the ſoul of a ſinner, then ſuch a one is ſtung indeed, this God doth ſometimes before death.</p>
               <p>Nay ſometimes God ſtingeth the conſciences of his own children for ſin. <hi>David</hi> cries out, he roared for the diſquietneſs of his ſpirit, his bones were broken, he was ſore vexed, <hi>Lord how long?</hi> faith he. If there be ſuch deep diſquiet, by reaſon of this ſting in the conſciences of good perſons; tell me then, what is the diſquiet that ſpringeth from ſin, in a <hi>Cain,</hi> a <hi>Judas,</hi> when it meets with a diſpairing diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? Thus you ſee Sin hath this time to <hi>ſting,</hi> and therefore think not that Sin will never <hi>ſting</hi> till death, ſometimes <hi>Sin ſtingeth a man before death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another time is <hi>at death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A: death.</note> When Death cometh and arreſteth a ſinner in an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God, ſeizeth on a perſon that is under the power of Sin, on one that is in his ſins unrouched, howſoever he behaved himſelf in his life-time, yet then the very name of Death breaks his heart, it apaleth him, and then it ſtings ſuch a Perſon. <hi>It is appointed</hi> (beloved) <hi>for all of us once to die;</hi> Death will one day arreſt every man, but when Death appeareth before a man, that hath not a part in Chriſt, that is under the power of his ſins, when it cometh to a <hi>Belſhazar,</hi> it makes his very <hi>joynts to ſmite one againſt another,</hi> it is a <hi>ſting</hi> to him amidſt all thoſe <hi>ſweet morſels</hi> his ſins, which he ſo much affected, and ſo earneſtly purſued, it is a very poyſon to him; nothing is a poyſon now to us but ſin only; but then at the time of death ſin is a poyſon indeed.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:47453:45"/>
At the day of judgement.
<note place="margin">At the day of Judgement.</note> Is not the concience of a ſinner (think you) ſtinged, and his ſpirit deeply affected, by reaſon of the great wrath of God that is to be poured out, when he ſhall <hi>cry to the mountains to cover him,</hi> when he ſhall call to thoſe inſenſible creatures, that are not able to lend him that courteſie to cruſh him to nothing? Make this our one cauſe, think of it, it will be our caſe, as <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for us all to die,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">After the Judgement.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo we muſt all come to judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after the Judgement, when the ſentence, <hi>go you curſed,</hi> is paſt, the <hi>ſting</hi> of Sin ceaſeth not, no, the <hi>worm</hi> for ever gnaweth in Hell. It were a happineſs for a ſinner, if he might only hear the ſentence, if this <hi>worm</hi> might not ſtill gnaw his conſcience, but then, this is his burthen, Sin ſhall <hi>ſting</hi> him for ever.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt reſpect in which ſin is called the <hi>ſting of death,</hi> becauſe then Sin ſtingeth more eminently and ſenſibly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is called the <hi>ſting of death,</hi> in reſpect of the metaphor the Apoſtle aludeth unto, it is taken from the ſting of a Serpent, and ſo Sin is a <hi>ſting</hi> in a double reſpect; Firſt in reſpect of the fearfulneſs, and then in reſpect of the hurtfulneſs of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Sin makes death fearful.</note> in reſpect of the fearfulneſs; It is Sin that makes Death fearful to a man. Indeed I confeſs, that in the beſt Chriſtian (though Chriſt have pulled out the <hi>ſting of death</hi> yet) there are natural grudgings, and ſhruglings. As to a Serpent, though the ſting be pulled away, yet there are ſome abhorrings, and diſlikes in a man. But then how terrible is Death when it cometh in a compleate Armour, as it doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a perſon in whom Sin remaineth in its full power? it muſt needs then be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>See the differences between two perſons, the one is afraid of every one he meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the other is not, what is the reaſon? the one is greatly indebted and ingaged, the other is free. So it is with a Chriſtian, and another man, the one cannot hear of Death but his heart breaks, he is full of fear and horrour; the other heareth of Death, and is only ſomewhat affected in the hearing of it, but not poſſeſſed with that fear as is the other; what is the reaſon? the <hi>ſting of death</hi> remaineth in one, and not in another. Sin therefore is a ſting in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a ſting in reſpect of hurtfulneſs. The ſting of the Serpent is a hurtfull thing,
<note place="margin">Sin makes death hurtful.</note> it poyſoneth the vitall parts, it takes away life it ſelf. All the evill that cometh to us by death, cometh by ſin. Man need not complain of the ilneſs of the priſon ſo much, as of his own folly, that he ingaged himſelf in debt, whereby he is caſt into priſon. Why complaineſt thou of the miſery in Hell? rather labour to <hi>break off thy ſins</hi> that are the cauſe of all that miſery: all the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful quality, and miſerable condition that befalleth a perſon in Death and Hell, is for Sin: the eternal ſeparation of the ſoul from God, and all puniſhment that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows after in Hell, are the fruit of mans ſin. Hell had not been Hell without Sin: it is Sin that cauſeth it to become hurtfull.</p>
               <p>Thus I have explained theſe inquiries.</p>
               <p>Now I come to make Uſe and application, and ſo conclude the Point.</p>
               <p>The firſt Uſe of this point ſhall be this;
<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> If <hi>Sin</hi> be <hi>the ſting of death,</hi> let it be our wiſdom to get this ſting pulled out in the time of our life. <hi>Oh that this people were wiſe</hi> (faith God) <hi>then would they conſider their latter end.</hi> If you were wiſe that hear me this day, you would conſider that Death will come, and (if it be not taken away before-hand) with a <hi>ſting</hi> upon the ſoul.</p>
               <p>My brethren, we have many enemies to deal with, even now at this very inſtant, but there is yet an enemy, as the Apoſtle faith, <hi>The laſt enemy to be ſubdued is Death,</hi> he his behind: and here is the difference betwixt Death our laſt enemy, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our enemies: ſome other of our enemies cannot be ſubdued, but by their preſence, but (let me tell you) this Death is ſuch an enemy, as is never ſubdued, but by his abſence, thou canſt never overcome Death in death, thou muſt not reſerve this combat till thou come to the field, but thou muſt overcome this enemy before he cometh, thou muſt overcome him in thy life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:47453:46"/>
How is that? Pull out the <hi>ſting</hi> of him now, then Death is conquered. How will you diſarm the tongues of malicious ſlanderous perſons, and deprive them of their viperous ſpeech? by an innocent life. So, how will you take away the <hi>ſting of death?</hi> watch againſt Sin, take away ſin, and you take away the power from Death, ſet upon Sin, and Death is overcome, ſo much ſin as is now dead, ſo much is Death conquered.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you ſeriouſly conſider theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it will not be long, ere Death knock at theſe doors of ours, theſe houſes of clay muſt ſhortly be ruinated, we muſt certainly be reſolved into duſt. What is this life of ours,

When the breath of man ceaſeth, the ſhip lieth in a dead calm. <hi>Man goeth to his long home,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>and the mourners follow in the ſtreets.</hi> Death is our <hi>long home,</hi> we all are the <hi>mourners,</hi> we <hi>follow in the ſtreets.</hi> This dead carcaſs is an example that leads us to our home, and <hi>a ſermon</hi> to tell us that we muſt follow: we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low now in a charitable expreſſion, but we ſhall follow one day, in paying of the ſame debt. Look over all the times of the world, and the diſpoſitions of perſons, look over learning and folly, greatneſs or poorneſs, find me a man that eſcaped Death. Die we muſt; and we have need to have this much preſſed upon us, for it is a hard matter to beleeve that we muſt die, that I muſt be the man that muſt die: common notice of Death are granted, but that I muſt die, and lie in the duſt, and ſtand before God, it is a hard matter to beleeve this.</p>
               <p>And conſider this ſecondly, that Death will be terrible to thee, if he knock and find a <hi>ſting</hi> in thee. Thou that now wilt not be reclaimed from ſwearing; Alas what will become of that blaſpheming ſoul of thine, when death ſhall come and find a <hi>ſting</hi> of blaſphemy in thee? How dareſt thou think of giving up that ſwearing ſoul of thine to the Judge of heaven and earth? Thou unrighteous perſon that wilt not ſanctifie the Lords day, how dareſt thou give up that unholy ſoul of thine to the holy God? Doſt thou think to have an eternal reſt in heaven, and wilt not give God a reſt here? So I might ſay for all kind of ſinners. Think of this, take heed leſt Death find a <hi>ſting</hi> in thee, for all the <hi>ſting</hi> that Death hath, it findeth in thy ſelf, look to it, thy, condition will be fearful, if Death come and find Sin unmortified, unrepented of in thee. <hi>God will</hi> certainly <hi>bring thee to judgment,</hi> for every thought, and word, and action.</p>
               <p>Thirdly conſider this, that naturally we are ſo tempered, that if Death come, he ſhall find his weapons,
<note place="margin">How a man ſhall know whether Death ſhall come with a ſting to him.</note> and ſtrength in us, in every man of us, I mean conſidered naturally.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall I know whether Death when he cometh, ſhall find a ſting in me or no?</p>
               <p>I will only give you two tryals, you ſhall know it thus. Firſt, if thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience now <hi>ſting</hi> thee for ſome approved ſin, if thou repent not, Death will aſſuredly meet thee with a <hi>ſting;</hi> that approved ſin of thine will be the <hi>

What though perhaps he can ſay, Lord I have heard ſo many Sermons, I have been ſo much in conference, and the like, will this inable a man againſt the fear of Death? No, nothing but this, that he hath a ſincere heart, that his heart is unmixed, that ſin is not affected in his ſoul, that there is no ſin that he would live in, no duty that he wonld not do, <hi>Lord remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I have walked before thee uprightly;</hi> I ſay, nothing will inable a man more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fear then ſincerity, and nothing diſgraceth, perplexeth the ſoul in an exigent, more then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

How proveth he that? <hi>We live unto him:</hi> That is the work of a ſincere heart; A true Chriſtian liveth not to himſelf, but to Chriſt; Now if thy conſcience give thee this teſtimony, I have lived unto Chriſt, then whether <hi>I live or die, I am the Lords;</hi> the Apoſtle concludeth it. So right is that of <hi>Solomon, Riches availeth not in the day of wrath, but righteouſneſs delivereth from death.</hi> Thy righteouſneſs and ſincerity delivereth thee, not from dying, but from death; It takes away the <hi>ſting</hi> and power of Death, Death ſhall not be death to thee, it is only a paſſage to thee. Therefore remember as to get a part in Chriſt, ſo to get a perfect, and ſincere heart, and then the <hi>ſting of death</hi> is gone. But a hypocritical divided heart, a heart and a heart, that will ſting a man.
<note place="margin">3. Practiſe Mortification.</note> That is the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wouldeſt thou have the <hi>ſting of death</hi> pulled out now; Then mortiſie thy ſins now, do it preſently. Remember what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith (but I think he ſpeaks it in reſpect of afflictions)
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I profeſs by our rejoycing in Chriſt Jeſus, I die dayly.</hi> If it be meant of afflictions, yet it ſhould be verified of us in reſpect of ſin, <hi>die dayly</hi> to ſin, and then the <hi>ſting of death</hi> is gone. Oh beloved, our condition will be ſad, and diſcomfortable, when at once we muſt enter into the field with Death and Sin; he that dieth daily to Sin, he hath nothing to do with Death when it cometh; Death may come to ſuch a party, but cannot hurt him, he may reſt quietly when it cometh. And obſerve it, ſo much ſin as thou now ſpareſt, ſo much <hi>ſting</hi> thou reſerveſt for Death, and is it not folly in a man to ſpare ſin that giveth a <hi>ſting</hi> to Death?</p>
               <p>But now, as a man is to crucifie evey ſin, (let me put in this caution, and remember this adviſe) As the <hi>ſting</hi> of every ſin is to be pulled out, ſo pull out eſpecially the ſting of that Sin, that now ſtingeth thy conſcience, that now lieth upon thy conſcience; for if it work now, it will work fearefully at death: Death doth not leſſen the work of ſin, but inrageth it; God will then preſent and <hi>ſet thy ſins in order before thee:</hi> perhaps God hath brought thee here to day to hear this Word; get thee home, and ſet thy ſoul in order.</p>
               <p>The love of Sin, and the fear of Death, ſeldome part, and where Sin is much loved, Death will there be much feared; Death is never more terrible, then where ſin is moſt delighted in. Therefore crucifie ſin, if thou wilt have the <hi>ſting of death</hi> taken away. It may be thou thinkeſt it is a troubleſome work: but remember, that thoſe ſins which thou now ſo much delighteſt in, and loveſt and liveſt in, will then prove the <hi>ſting of death</hi> to thee; If a man would ſpend his time in the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſication of ſin, when death cometh, he ſhould have nothing to do, but to let his ſoul looſe to God, and to give it up to him, as <hi>into the hands of his moſt faithfull Creator and Redeemer.</hi> And is it not an excellent thing for a man to have nothing to do with Death when it cometh?</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2.</note> here is a uſe of comfort. If it hath pleaſed God to give any of us the grace to pull out the <hi>ſting of death,</hi> it is a great comfort.</p>
               <p>But Death is approaching, you will ſay.</p>
               <p>Oh but Death is diſarmed, the <hi>ſting</hi> of it is taken away, what a ſingular comfort is it then to you that Death is coming? Indeed all the comfort that the ſoul is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of is this, that the <hi>ſting of death</hi> is took away? Now when Death cometh upon ſuch a man, it doth but free him from all that ſtate of miſery he is in here, from all that extremity of condition that he is put into, from all thoſe diverſities of occaſions, preſſing occaſions, of tumbling about in the world, Death doth but put an end to all.</p>
               <p>And (which is an excellent comfort to a Chriſtian) Sin is ended with Death: what afflicteth the ſoule of a Chriſtian, but that he carrieth about him <hi>a body of ſin, and of death?</hi> This was a trouble to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and is to every true Chriſtian. Now, when Death cometh, there is an end of this <hi>Body of ſin,</hi> thou ſhalt never ſin more, thou ſhalt never grieve the Spirit of God more, thou ſhalt never be clogged with ſuch imperfections, and infirmities in duty: that death, that cometh to thee, ſhall paſs thee, to the fruition of eternal glory, and what canſt thou deſire more, then to be happy in eternal glory with God?</p>

Firſt;
<note place="margin">1. Death is.</note> 
                  <hi>Death is.</hi> Ye know that well enough, your eyes ſhew it you daily: our ſenſes declare it ſo plainly, that no man is ſo ſenſeleſs that knoweth it not: It is agreed upon by all. Only for your better furtherance to make uſe of this point, let us acquaint you with that which nature will teach ye concerning Death. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, with that which Scripture will teach you, above, and better then Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Nature ſheweth ye concerning Death,
<note place="margin">Nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> firſt what it is. And then,</p>
               <p>Secondly, what Properties it hath.</p>
               <p>It telleth us this,
<note place="margin">1. what death is.</note> That <hi>Death</hi> is in abſence from life, a ceaſing from beeing, when one was beeing, to be thruſt (as it were out of the preſent world, and be caſt ſome where. This is all that Nature informeth us concerning the Eſſence and Being of <hi>Death. Death</hi> is a deviding of us from this life, and from the things of this life, and ſends us abroad we know not where.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of death, That it is.</note> Nature teacheth us three Properties concerning <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One, that it is <hi>univerſal;</hi> It hath tied all to it, high and low, rich and poor. <hi>Death</hi> knocks at the Princes pallace,
<note place="margin">1. Univerſal.</note> as well as at the poor habitation of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man. It is a thing that reſpects no mans greatneſs, it regardeth no wealth, nor wit, nothing; <hi>Death</hi> takes all before it. That Nature teacheth too.</p>
               <p>Secondly;
<note place="margin">2. Inevitable.</note> Nature teacheth that <hi>Death is inevitable.</hi> If a man would give all the world, he cannot thruſt it out of doors. It takes whole Armies as well as one man. It ſcorneth to be reſiſted by the Phiſitians: there is no words, no means to eſcape it. It is ſuch an enemy as we muſt grapple with, and it will conquer. This Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">3. Uncertain.</note> Nature teacheth that <hi>death</hi> is <hi>uncertain.</hi> A man knoweth not when <hi>Death</hi> will come to him, or when it will lay hold on him, or by what means it will ſetch him out of the world. It may fetch him out of the world at any time, or in any place, and by ſuch occaſion, as it is impoſſible for any wit to think of before. This is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance all that Nature teacheth. And the knowledg of this, it is for good uſe, as well to remember and conſider it, as to underſtand it.</p>
               <p>But now I go on to tell ye; what the Scripture teacheth concerning <hi>Death:</hi> for that giveth a perfecter and larger information of the thing, then the dim light of Nature.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture then (over and above that which Nature ſheweth) telleth us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Death</hi> theſe things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it ſheweth better what it is; and then,</p>
               <p>It ſheweth whence it cometh, and what are the cauſes of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it declareth the conſequences what follow upon it.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, and beſtly, it tellech us the remedy againſt the ill of <hi>Death.</hi> In all which Nature ſtumbleth, and can do little or nothing.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">The Scripture teacheth, 1. what death is.</note> the Scripture telleth us what it is; It telleth us how that it is the diſolution of a man, not the annihilation; It doth not make him ceaſe to be, but takes aſunder awhile the ſoul from the body: It carrieth the one to the earth, and the other to another world: ſo that both continue to be, though they be not united as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The word of God teacheth us, that he hath created the world (as it were) a houſe of three Stories. The middle is this preſent life where we be. And there is a lower place, the Dungeon, a place of unhappineſs and deſtruction; there is a higher place, a pallace of glory. According as men behave themſelves in this middle room; ſo <hi>Death</hi> either leadeth them down to the place of unhappineſs, or conveyeth them up to the pallace of glory and bleſſedneſs. This, Nature is ignorant of, but the Scripture is plain in. The <hi>rich man dieth,</hi> and his ſoul is carried to Hell; the poor man when he died, his ſoul was advanced to Heaven. So that <hi>Death</hi> is nothing but the meſſenger of God to take the ſoul out of the body, and to convey it to a place of more happineſs, or more miſery then can be conceived.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. what are the cauſes of death.</note> the Scripture acquaints us further with the cauſe of <hi>death.</hi> Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers wondred ſince nature deſireth a perpetuity, and continuance of it ſelf, that man ſhould be ſo ſhort a time in the world. The Scripture endeth this wonderment <pb n="83" facs="tcp:47453:48"/>and tels us that man indeed was made immortal, to continue for ever, and ſhould not have died: but <hi>ſin came into the world, and by ſin death. Death</hi> is the mother of ſin, and of all miſery, that by little and little draweth to <hi>death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay ſin: the firſt ſin of our firſt Parents whereby they tranſgreſſed that moſt eaſie and equal mandate about eating the forbidden fruit. That tranſgreſſion that was the treading under foot the covenant of works, and the diſanulling of it, that ſin let in <hi>Death</hi> at a great Gap: and now it triumpheth, and beareth rule over all the world.</p>
               <p>Nature cannot tell which way in the world a man ſhould die ſo ſoon, and that he that is the Lord of all creatures, ſhould be inferiour to a great number of them in length of life. But the word of God unriddleth this riddle, and telleth us that God made man, that he might and ſhould have lived for ever, but Sin coming, and coming in the perſon of the firſt man, it brought <hi>death,</hi> and made all men mortal: and when ſin entred. Gods curſe came, and that working upon us poor and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable creatures, it is the cauſe that we cannot continue long here.</p>
               <p>It was equal that <hi>death</hi> ſhould follow ſin, for ſince God made man to obey his will, when man had unfitted himſelf for Gods ſervice, it was reaſon that he ſhould have a ſhort continuance of life, for the longer he endured, the more he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe himſelf.</p>
               <p>Ye ſee then two things that the Scripture teacheth concerning death.
<note place="margin">3. what are the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of death. Heb. 9.17.</note> The third thing it ſheweth is, what followeth after death: and that is plain; <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die, and after death cometh judgment.</hi> Narure never dreamed of judgment after <hi>Death,</hi> but the Scripture telleth us, there is a judgment after <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Judgment, what is that?</p>
               <p>Judgment (ye know) is a calling of a man before Authority, a looking into his wayes, a conſidering of his actions, a finding out whether he be a ſinner, an evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doer: and if he find him ſo, to paſſe ſentence according to his evil deeds. When God hath took the ſoul from the body, he takes the ſoul firſt, and after both ſoul and body, and preſents them before his own Tribunal, and there ſearcheth into every mans life, ranſacks his conſcience, looks deep into his converſation, and inquireth into his ſecrets, openeth his actions, and whole carriage from his infancy to his laſt breath, and findeth out the things that he hath done, and paſſeth ſentence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that he hath done.</p>
               <p>This Indgment hath two degrees.
<note place="margin">The particular judgment.</note> Firſt aſſoon as a man dieth. No ſooner is the ſoul ſeparated from this caſe (as it were) the body, but inſtantly it is preſented before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and there he paſſeth ſentence, either that it is a true beleever, a godly liver, a perſon united to Chriſt, that walked as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt, and then it receiveth glory, and joy, and bliſs for the preſent, more then tongue can expreſs. Or elſe it findeth againſt him, that he was a ſinfnl man, a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, a hyyocrite, a diſſembler, one that named Chriſt with his tongue, but did not <hi>depart from iniquity,</hi> nor live according to the Goſpel of Chriſt: and then he is delivered up to Satan, to be hurried down to Hell, and there to ſuffer the wrath of God according to the deſert of ſo great wickedneſs. This particular judgment paſſeth upon every ſoul aſſoon as it leaveth the Body.</p>
               <p>Then followeth the great univerſal Judgment,
<note place="margin">The general Judgment.</note> when ſoul and body ſhall be reunited, and ſtand before God: every particular man that ever hath been, is, or ſhall be, every man ſhall appear in their own perſons, their whole lives ſhall be laid open, all ſecret things ſhall be made known, for God (faith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall judg the ſecrets of all hearts by Jeſus Chriſt according to my Goſpel.</hi> This is the third thing that the word of God informeth us concerning <hi>death,</hi> that nature could never do.</p>
               <p>The laſt,
<note place="margin">5. what is the remedy againſt the evil of death.</note> that is the beſt, the Scripture giveth us a remedy againſt the ill of <hi>death.</hi> It is a pittiful thing to hear of mortality and ſickneſs, if there were not a good Potion or Phiſick preſcribed to aſcape the ill of it. To hear tell of <hi>Death,</hi> and ſo tell, as the Scripture ſaith, that it is a going to another world of weale or woe, and not to hear of a remedy, it is woful tydings, and would wring tears from a hard heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:47453:49"/>
But the Scripture makes report of <hi>death,</hi> not only tollerable and eaſie, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and gladſome to a Chriſtian heart: for it ſheweth by whom, and by what means we may infallibly, and certainly, eſcape all the hurt that <hi>Death</hi> can do: Nay, by what means we may order our ſelves ſo, that <hi>Death</hi> may be beneficial to us. What is that?</p>
               <p>In one ſhort word; It is Chriſt; <hi>I am the reſurrection, and the life, he that beleeveth in me, ſhall never ſee death.</hi> He meaneth to hurt himſelfe. Again, <hi>This is the meſſage, that God hath given us life, and this life is in his Son.</hi> And <hi>He that hath the Son hath life.</hi> Our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt came into the world (as the Apoſtle telleth us) <hi>that he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, and ſo ſet them at liberty, that all their life-time were in bondage under the fear of death.</hi> And Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith; <hi>He came into the world to deſtroy the works of the devil:</hi> which are ſin and death. So that now <hi>Death</hi> hath loſt his ſting, becauſe Chriſt overcame it: in dying he ſlue <hi>Death,</hi> and was the death of <hi>Death:</hi> this man Chriſt, God and Man, he offered himſelf to his Father as a Sacrifice for the ſins of the world, and dying a curſed death upon the Croſs, ſo ſatisfied the juſtice of God on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of all thoſe that are in him, that <hi>death</hi> can do them no harm: It is nothnig elſe but a paſſage to eternal bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>Oh bleſſed be the name of God, that hath been pleaſed to provide ſo perfect a remedy againſt ſo mortal an enemy: and to lay it open ſo clearly and plainly in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Ye have heard of thoſe things that I thought to put you in mind of concerning <hi>Death,</hi> and ſo I have done with the firſt point.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is,
<note place="margin">2. Death is an enemy.</note> That <hi>Death is an enemy.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us of a certain <hi>ſting</hi> it hath, <hi>Oh death where is thy ſting?</hi> It is an armed enemy, it cometh as a Serpent with a <hi>ſting</hi> that entreth into a mans ſoul, putteth it to exream perplexity, if he taks not order to diſarm this enemy.</p>
               <p>An enemy ye know is a perſon that ſetteth himſelf wilfully to hurt, a man may hurt his neighbour, either through indiſcretion, or unadviſedneſs againſt his will, or he may lay wait to do him hurt, intending miſceif, and ſeeking to peforme ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that ſhall be injurious to him. We call not him an enemy that we receive a little hurt from againſt his will, contrary to his purpoſe and intention: but he that ſtudieth, and before-hand deſireth to be an enemy, Now <hi>Death</hi> (as we may ſay) ſtudieth our hurt in all extremity before-hand.</p>
               <p>There is but two ſorts of hurt that can come to a man.
<note place="margin">1. Depriving a man of all that is benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> One is, to deprive him of that which is beneficial and comfortable, to rob him of all that is contentful to him in this life. As when a company of Foes break into a Nation, they burn their goods, and ſpoyle their houſes, and rob and take away all that is comfortable to them, ſo much as they can. <hi>Death</hi> is ſuch an <hi>enemy:</hi> It deſireth to bereave a man of that neceſſary contentment he hath. When it meeteth with a learned man, it takes away all his learning at one blow, aſſoon as he is dead, he ceaſeth to be a great ſcholler. It cometh to a rich man, and robs him of all his goods at one blow too: though he have millions, <hi>Death</hi> cauſeth all to be another mans. When it cometh to a King, it pulleth him beſide his Throne, takes his Crown off his head, and caſteth both him and it into the duſt, he is King no longer when he is dead. And ſo in all the benefits of this life, it takes away the pleaſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of a man; it takes away the husband from the wife, and the wife from the husband; it devideth children from Parents, and Parents from children: all the benefits that this life afford, <hi>Death</hi> ſtrippeth a man of them all, and turnes him naked out of the world, juſt <hi>as he came he muſt goe, and carry nothing in his hand: Death</hi> will not admit him to take one farthing, or any thing elſe with him. So he is an <hi>enemy,</hi> for he ſpoileth us of whatſoever is deſirable in this life.</p>
               <p>But he is an <hi>enemy</hi> alſo in inflicting a great deal of ill upon men.
<note place="margin">2. Inflicting miſery upon a man.</note> So <hi>death</hi> bringeth torment for the preſent: It is a terrible thing to wreſtle with; it makes a man bleed, and ſweat as it were: No man can incounter with <hi>death,</hi> but he feeleth anxiety and vexation of body and mind, (unleſs he have comfort from above to enable him to wreſtle with it, but) in his own proper nature it is ſo furious an <hi>enemy,</hi> 
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:47453:49"/>that it doth not ceaſe till it hath dragged the ſoul into the preſence of God, and after, from his Tribunal to the torment of eternal fire in Hell. That ſucceedeth <hi>death,</hi> for naturally of its own nature it tendeth to the deſtruction of man, becauſe it is a fruit of ſin, and therefore muſt needs he the perdition, and overthrow of the ſoul. For ſin bringeth deſtruction in regard it makes God angry with us, and ſeparateth from him, and by conſequence from all manner of comfort: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it ſeparateth from him, it bringeth all manner of ill, his wrath, his hatred, and ill will the greateſt of all. <hi>Death</hi> (I ſay) properly, and of it ſelfe intendeth, and ſeeks to draw all thoſe that it layes hold on to a ſtate of everlaſting unhappineſs, therefore it is an enemy. So you ſee the ſecond point opened.</p>
               <p>The third is,
<note place="margin">3. Death the laſt enemy.</note> that <hi>Death is the last enemy,</hi> after which there ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>But I muſt tell you to whom it is the laſt,
<note place="margin">Not to all.</note> not to all. For there are a generation of men that ſhall feel <hi>death</hi> to be the laſt of enemies, and in a manner the firſt. But to the Saints and thoſe that are prepared for <hi>death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">But to the Saints.</note> and thoſe that will uſe the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to theſe, and theſe alone, <hi>death</hi> is the laſt enemy: after once they have grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and fought, and encountred with this <hi>enemy,</hi> they are at peace and reſt; as he ſaith, <hi>Happy are they that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours.</hi> There is no more toyl and miſery to a good man after death. And why? Becauſe, <hi>death</hi> ſeparateth ſin from his ſoul, as well as the ſoul from the body, and ſo taking away the cauſe of unreſt, it muſt needs take away miſery and unhappineſſe it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Indeed properly, <hi>Death</hi> doth it not, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by death. For it pleaſeth him when his ſervants leave this world, then they are fit to enter into a place of happineſs in another world, which they could not be, except they were freed from ſin. <hi>Death</hi> is the daughter of ſin, and with a happy patricide (as it were) at once it deſtroyeth it ſelf and ſin: and therefore it takes away all miſery, becauſe it takes away all ſin. Therefore it is the laſt enemy, becauſe it killeth the worſt of our enemtes, for when we are dead, there ſhall be no more enmity between God and us, and ſo no more enemy. This is the third point.</p>
               <p>The laſt is,
<note place="margin">4. Death ſhall be deſtroyed.</note> that <hi>this enemy ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> A thing is deſtroyed, aboliſhed, when its ſelf ceaſeth to be, and it took out of the way, and when all the ill effects that it would produce, and effect or hath, are removed. So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt aboliſheth <hi>Death,</hi> he deſtroyeth it, that it ſhall never again be known in the world, or felt by his ſervants: and he preventeth all thoſe evill effects that it would work in the ſoul for eternity, and removeth all the ill effects of it, that it hath wrought on their bodies for the preſent time. <hi>Death</hi> takes away a mans goods for the preſent, Chriſt aboliſheth that, he giveth everlaſting ſubſtance in heaven. <hi>Death</hi> takes away friends. Chriſt aboliſheth that, he ſends us to heaven, where we have more friends and better. <hi>Death</hi> brings the body to rottenneſs and corruption, it laieth it in the duſt, turns it to putrifaction, Chriſt aboliſheth that, at the Reſurrection it <hi>ſhall riſe again in glory.</hi> How that is done the Apoſtle tells us in the end of this chapter; The body ſhall be laid in the duſt, a weak and feeble, a mortal and natural body, but it ſhall be clothed with immortality; <hi>This mortal ſhall put on immortality, this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, then ſhall be fulfilled that ſaying, Death is ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> But this is alſo limited, it ſhall be deſtroyed, to whom? To thoſe that uſe the remedy, thoſe that partake of Chriſt, thoſe that have put on him, that is the <hi>Reſurrection and the life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have laid before your eyes briefly theſe four things, that the Apoſtle lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to treat of concerning death. That it is. That it is an enemy. That it is the laſt enemy. And that it ſhall be deſtroyed. Now I deſire to apply this, and to make uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> I ſhall be bold to play the Examiner, to ſearch each conſcience a little. Brethren, let the word of God enter into your ſouls. Ye hear that there is a <hi>death,</hi> and that this <hi>death</hi> is a ſore and bitter <hi>enemy:</hi> and ye hear that to ſome ſort of men it is the <hi>laſt enemy</hi> that ever they ſhall encounter with, and be freed from all the hurt of it, it ſhall be utterly deſtroyed. Now do ſo much as diſcend every one into himſelf, and inquire what care there hath been to prepare for <hi>death,</hi> to <pb n="86" facs="tcp:47453:50"/>make uſe of the remedy againſt <hi>death:</hi> what time and paines hath been beſtowed to ſeek to get that that is the only means to eſcape the Dart of this enemy, and that that is the only cauſe to procure this enfranchiſement to the ſoul, from that that elſe will deſtroy all.</p>
               <p>A man hath not fitted himſelf to encounter with his enemy, when he looks after wealth, and followeth the pleaſures, and contentments of this life; theſe things will do no good, they will be rather a burthen to the heart, and vexe the ſoul, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the miſchief, laying more ſin upon the ſoul, and giving <hi>death</hi> darts to pierce the ſoul with.</p>
               <p>But when is a man fit for <hi>death?</hi> and who may encounter with this enemy with ſafety?</p>
               <p>I will tell ye;
<note place="margin">How a man may be fitted for death.</note> That man that takes the greateſt care to diſarm <hi>death</hi> of his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, to arm himſelf with defenſive weapons againſt <hi>death.</hi> If an enemy come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man with good weapons in his hand,
<note place="margin">1. Get death diſarmed now.</note> and find him altogether unweaponed, it is hard for a naked unarmed man to deal with him: it is hard for a man that never thought of it before, to fight with one that is skilful at his weapons. <hi>Death</hi> (I told ye) is <hi>an enemy,</hi> and an <hi>enemy</hi> that is skilful in his weapons: and the weapon of <hi>death</hi> it is our own ſin. <hi>Death</hi> bringeth nothing with it to hurt a man; It find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with us, and in us, that whereby to hurt us; ſo many corruptions as are in thy heart, ſo many weapons; ſo many idle words, ſo many bad deeds; ſo many ſwords to pierce thy heart. <hi>Death</hi> maketh uſe of thoſe weapons it findeth in our ſelves, and with them he deſtroyeth, and killeth, and brings us to perdition.</p>
               <p>Now, what have ye done (beloved) to diſarme <hi>death?</hi> what care have ye taken to break ſin apieces, that it may not be as a ſword ready drawn for the hand of <hi>death</hi> when it cometh? as Arrows in a Bow, to ſhoot at you, when <hi>Death</hi> layeth hold on you?</p>
               <p>That man that hath took no care to overcome ſin in the power of it, and to get himſelf free from the guilt and puniſhment of it, is unfit for <hi>death.</hi> If <hi>death</hi> come upon him, and find his offences unrepented of, unpardoned, unſubdued, he will ſo order thoſe offences, that he will thruſt them into his foul, as ſo many poiſoned Darts, that will bring ſorrow, and anguiſh, and vexation, and deſtruction to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Ye may ſee then whether ye have any fitneſs to meet with this Enemy, whether ye be in caſe to fight that battel, that of neceſſity ye muſt; for <hi>Death</hi> (as I told ye before) is enevitable.</p>
               <p>If ye have not; Get alone between God and thy ſelf, and there call to mind the corruption of thy nature, the ſins of thy childhood, of thy body, of thy mind, bring thy ſoul into his preſence, confeſs thy ſins, with an endeavour to break thy heart for them, and to be ſorry for them, mightily crying to him in the mediation of that bleſſed Advocate Jeſus Chriſt, that died on the Croſs, to pardon, and to waſh thy ſoul in his bloud, and to deliver thee from the pollution of thy ſins. Beg the Spirit of ſanctification to bear down thoſe ſins, and ſubdue thy corruptions. Beſtow time to perform theſe exerciſes daily, carefully preſent thy ſelf before God, thus to renew thy repentance and faith in Chriſt, to make thy peace with God: Labour to purge away the filthineſs of thy ſin, and then whenſoever <hi>Death</hi> cometh, thou ſhalt find in thy ſelf ſufficient againſt it, thou haſt diſarmed it.</p>
               <p>But if ye ſpend your time in purſuing profits, and pleaſures, and follow the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of this life, and either ye do not think of <hi>death,</hi> or ye think of it no otherwiſe then a heathen man would have done, to no purpoſe; ye think of it to enjoy the world while ye live, becauſe ye know not how ſoon <hi>death</hi> will end the world and you, if you play the Epicures in the thought of <hi>Death,</hi> to annimate you to enjoy the outward benefits of this life: to think of it to no purpoſe, but only to talk and diſcourſe now and then as occaſion ſerveth: then <hi>Death</hi> will find your ſouls laden with innumerable ſins that repentance hath not diſcharged, and undoubtedly it will bring eternal perdition. Have ye thus diſarmed <hi>Death?</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:47453:50"/>
But again,
<note place="margin">2. Get armour againſt death.</note> a mans ſelf muſt be armed, or elſe he cannot incounter with his <hi>enemy,</hi> What is our Armour againſt <hi>Death</hi> to keep off that blow.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle in one word ſheweth us theſe Armours, when he ſaith, a <hi>Breaſt-plate of faith, and love, and the hope of ſalvation a Helmet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a man have got faith to reſt on Chriſt alone for eternal happineſs, and his ſoul filled with the hope of glory, and ſalvation through him, and then with love to him, and his ſervants for his ſake; Theſe three vertues will ſecure a man againſt all the hurt that <hi>death</hi> can doe. <hi>Faith, Hope, and Charity,</hi> the Cardinal vertues that Chriſtian religion requires, and commands us to ſeek, theſe are Armour of proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the blows of <hi>death:</hi> he that hath them ſhall never be hurt of <hi>Death,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhall never taſte of the ſecond <hi>death:</hi> he hath only to wreſtle with the firſt Death, and there is no terrour, nor terribleneſs it that, if a mans heart be ſecure by theſe Graces.</p>
               <p>Faith whereby we depend on Chriſt, and on him alone for grace and ſalvation, bringing hope whereby we expect and look for ſalvation of our ſouls by his blood according to his promiſe, and working charity whereby we love him for his goodneſs, and his ſervants for his ſake; (If it be charity not only of the lip to ſpeak well, but that that produceth wel-doing) I ſay this is that makes us that <hi>death</hi> cannot ſeparate us from Chriſt, but the further we are from life, the neerer we are to him, for when this outward <hi>tabernacle of</hi> our houſe <hi>is diſſolved, we have a building with God eternal in the heavens:</hi> and <hi>death</hi> to ſuch a man is nothing but the opening of the door to let him out of the dungeon of the world, and to place him happily in the Pallace of eternal bliſſe.</p>
               <p>I pray enter into conſideration how ye have behaved your ſelves in the courſe of your lives, whether as Heathens, or as Chriſtians. A man that takes no care to prepare for <hi>death,</hi> though he come to the Church from Sunday to Sunday, and partake of all Gods ordinances, yet if the conſideration of <hi>death</hi> be not ſo imprinted in him, that it become a motive to him to labour for Faith, and hope, and charity, and to endeavour to edifie himſelf in theſe graces, he liveth as a Heathen or an Infidel: and when <hi>death</hi> cometh to him, it will do him more hurt, then it will an Infidel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by how much God hath given him more means to eſcape, and by neglecting thoſe means, as his ſin is greater, ſo ſhall his puniſhment be.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> if ye have been careleſs for to prepare for this <hi>enemy;</hi> Now be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of it, and ſorrow for it, let your hearts now ſmite ye, and ake within you: Oh fooliſh man or woman (ſay) I have lived twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years, and ſome more; I have laboured againſt other enemies, if men had any thing againſt me, I would be ſure to take order; I have laboured for the things of this life, for riches and friends, and give my ſelf leave for to enjoy pleaſures, and taken pains to doe good to my body: but all this while it never came into my heart ſeriouſly to think, I muſt die, <hi>and after that comes Judgement,</hi> that I muſt ſtand before Gods Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and give account of my wayes; I have not laboured to beware of <hi>Death</hi> and of ſin: nor to kill my corruptions, I have not laboured to increaſe in <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>charity;</hi> I have left my ſelf unarmed againſt the laſt and worſt enemy. Oh what folly is this, to live in the world many a long day, and never to conſider, that there will be an end of all theſe dayes, and the end of thoſe, the beginning of another life, and a life that will be infinitely more miſerable then this.</p>
               <p>If this (beloved) have been any of your faults to be careleſly forgetful of your latter end, not to conſider of your departure hence: if the world have ſo tempted you, and pleaſures have ſo enamoured you, that you have forgotten your latter end, blame your ſelves, it is the greateſt of all follies.</p>
               <p>And that I may diſgrace this folly, and make you aſhamed of it; Conſider a little. That this is to be like children; The Apoſtle biddeth us not to be like children in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: but he that forgetteth <hi>Death,</hi> and is careleſs to prepare for it, is a very child. A little one never thinketh he ſhall ever be a man himſelf, and maintain himſelf, and live in the world by his own labour, or by that he ſhall have from his friends, he careth for nothing butmeat, and drink, and ſport, and paſtime: we blame their folly, andlaugh at it as rediculous, and therefore by our diligence we <pb n="88" facs="tcp:47453:51"/>prevent that ill that might elſe come upon them. Is it not thus with many of you? ye live and build houſes, and raiſe your names to be glorious, and to make a fair ſhew in the world: but to get grace, and to get faith, and hope, and love, and repentance, none of your thoughts almoſt run that way, ſcarce any of your thoughts are ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. Is not this to be children in underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Again he is a fooliſh man that knoweth he ſhall meet an enemy, and will not prepare. If a man ſhould hear of twenty or thirty thouſand ſouldiers were gathered againſt the City, and beſieged it to deſtroy it; He would not be ſo fooliſh, and ſo ſimple then, as to beſtow himſelf in his trade, and to follow his buſineſs, and to give himſelf to merrimeut, but he would get his weapons, and he would look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, help to arm the City, and to make it ſtrong. Why do ye not conſider that your ſoul is as a City? <hi>Death</hi> will come againſt it, and batter you with ſickneſs, with pains, and at laſt will certainly take it, and if the ſoul be not prepared, will carry it to Hell fire. Why will you be ſo retchleſs, and ſenſleſs to eat and drink, and labour to grow rich, to bury your ſelves in eatrthly labours, and never think how to eſcape, how <hi>Death</hi> may be kept out, that will deſtroy ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</p>
               <p>I preſume you are aſhamed of this folly by this time, I hope ye will go away with remorſe and ſorrow, for ſo careleſly neglecting a thing of ſo great importance to be provided for.</p>
               <p>In the third place therefore I entreat you,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. For Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> begin this great work this day. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (if you have not begun) the enemy lieth in wait for thee, oh man or woman, if thou be never ſo young, thou maiſt meet with him before night, if thou be old, thou muſt meet with him ere long. Prepare for him betime: think what an enemy may encounter thee in the way. If a man be to travel, though he be not aſſured to meet with an <hi>enemy,</hi> yet he will ſtrive to get good company, and weapon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will carry his ſword, ſomething he will do, that if a theef come to rob him he may be able to prevent the danger. Beloved, think that there is an enemy that way-laies us, as we go along in the world, one time or other he will be ſure to come upon us: therefore ſtir up your ſelves, begin this day to prepare for this <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ſhall I prepare for <hi>Death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told you before, it is not amiſs in a word to repeat it: Get <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, and <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and repentance. Theſe will be means to prepare and help thee againſt <hi>Death.</hi> Therefore (if hitherto thou have not) lament and bewail the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of thy nature and life. Aſſoon as thou art out of this place, get thee into a ſolitary room, fall upon thy knees, lament thy ſins, the ilneſs of thy nature and carriage, rehearſe thy wayes as much as thou canſt, condemn thy ſelf before God, mightily crie for pardon in the meditation of his Son, and never leave ſobbing and mourning, till he hath given thee ſome anſwer that he is reconciled. And then ſtrive to get faith in Chriſt, call to mind the perfection of his redemption, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his perſon and merits, that thou maiſt repoſe thy ſoul on him, that thou maiſt ſay, though my ſins be as the Stars, and exceed them, yet the merit of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and his ſatisfaction to the juſtice of God it is full: in him he is well pleaſed and reconciled, I will ſtay on him, Lord Chiiſt, thou haſt done and ſuffered enough to redeem me and Man-kind, thou haſt ſuffered for the propitiation of the world, though my ſins deſerve a thouſand damnations, yet I truſt upon thy mercy, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenent made in thy Word. Thus when a man laboureth to caſt himſelf on Chriſt, to lay the burthen of his ſalvation, and to venter his ſoul on him, now he hath beleeved, this Breaſt-plate, <hi>Death</hi> is not able to thruſt through.</p>
               <p>And then, labour that this faith may work ſo ſtrongly, that it may breed <hi>Hope,</hi> a conſtant and firm expectation grounded on the promiſes of the Word, that thou ſhalt be ſaved, and go to Heaven, and be admitted into the preſence of God, when thou ſhalt be ſeparated from this lower world. He that is armed with this hope, hath a <hi>Helmet, Death</hi> ſhall never hurt his head; it ſhall never be able to take away his comfort and peace; He ſhall ſmile at the approach of <hi>death,</hi> becauſe it can do nothing but help him to his kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:47453:51"/>
And then, labour for <hi>Charity,</hi> to inflame thee to him again, that hath ſhewed himſelf ſo truly loving to men, as to ſeek them when they were loſt, to redeem them when they were captives, and to reſtore them from that unhappineſs, that they had caſt themſelves into. Oh that I could love thee, and thy people for thy ſake, thou diddeſt die for them, ſhall not I be at a little coſt and pains to help them out of miſery.</p>
               <p>Thus if ye labour to be furniſhed with theſe graces, then you are armed againſt <hi>Death;</hi> thoſe will do you more good, then if you had gotten millions of millons of gold and ſilver. As you have underſtanding for the outward man, as you have care to provide for that, top reſerve and comfort life, while you are here, ſo have a care for the future world, and that boundleſs continuance of eternity. If a man live miſerable here, <hi>death</hi> will end it, if he be prepared for <hi>death,</hi> he ſhall live happily for ever; but if a man live happily (as we account it) and die miſerably, that miſery is endleſs. Ye miſtake (beloved) ye account men happy that abound in wealth and honour, that have great eſtates, I ſay ye miſtake in accounting men happy, that enjoy the good things of this life, that can live in proſperity to the laſt time of their age, poſſeſſing what they have gotten. If ſuch a man be not prepared for <hi>death; Death</hi> makes way for a greater unhappineſs after death. For the more ſin he hath committed, the more miſery ſhall betide him, his life being nothing but a continued chain of wickedneſs one link upon another, till he ſettle upon a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Death.</p>
               <p>And in the laſt place,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For comfort</note> here is a great deal of comfort, to thoſe that have laboured to prepare for <hi>death:</hi> though to them <hi>Death is an enemy,</hi> yet it is an <hi>enemy</hi> that is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>deſtroyed.</hi> The Philoſopher ſaid, that <hi>Death is the terribleſt of all terrible things;</hi> ſo it is to nature, becauſe it doth that that no other evil can do, it ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from all comfort, and carrieth us we know not whether.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Death</hi> is terrible to a man that is unarmed for <hi>death;</hi> but to the poor Saints that have beſtowed their time in humiliation, and ſupplication, and confeſſion, that have daily endeavoured to renew their <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>repentance, Death</hi> hath no manner of terribleneſs in the world: if it be terrible to a Chriſtian at the firſt, it is onely becauſe he hath forgot himſelf a little, he doth not bethink how he is armed.</p>
               <p>If God have fitted his ſervants for <hi>death,</hi> he hath done moſt for them: if they have not riches, yet they are fit for <hi>death:</hi> if they have not an eſtate amongſt men, it mattereth not a whit if they be fit for <hi>Death,</hi> if they be miſerable here, in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſickneſs, when others have health, it is no matter, all theſe increaſe their repentance, makes them labour for Faith, and Hope, and Charity, whereby they are armed againſt <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing can ſave us from the hurt of <hi>Death,</hi> but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, put on by <hi>Faith,</hi> and that furniſhed with <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> If God give a man other things and not theſe graces, <hi>Death</hi> is not <hi>deſtroyed</hi> to him. But if he deny him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, and give him theſe graces, he doth enough for him, <hi>Death is deſtroyed</hi> to him. His body indeed falleth under the ſtroke of <hi>Death</hi> as other mens, but his ſoul is not hurt. <hi>Death</hi> layeth him a rotting as the common ſort, but the ſoul goeth to the poſſeſſion of glory, and remaineth with Chriſt; <hi>When he is abſent from the body, he is preſent with the Lord.</hi> Nay, when the laſt day ſhall come, <hi>Death</hi> ſhall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>ſwallowed up,</hi> then the poor, and frail, and weak body, that ſleepeth in corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mortality, ſhall be raiſed in honour, and in immortal beauty and glory, a ſpiritual body, free from all corporal weakneſſes that accompany the natural body; it ſhall be made moſt glorious &amp; bleſſed, even as if it were a ſpirit, all the weakneſſes that accompany the natural being of the body ſhall be baken away, and it ſhall enjoy as much perfection as a body can, and therefore it is called ſpiritual: Therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you rejoyce in the Lord if your ſouls tell you, that you are armed againſt this <hi>death.</hi>

And the time it is the ſame, and every way anſwerable to that it was before. It was begun in a time of Mortality ſeared; and now will be finiſhed in a time of Mortality certain. And that there ſhould be no part of correſpondency wanting: this latter part of the Verſe is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the former, it is but the ſame again in other words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:47453:53"/>
In the former part there is mention of the <hi>righteous man,</hi> here of the <hi>mercyful man,</hi> they are both one. In that, <hi>he is ſaid to periſh,</hi> here to <hi>be taken away,</hi> they are both the ſame. There, <hi>No man is ſaid to lay it to heart;</hi> and here <hi>no man is ſaid to conſider it;</hi> both the ſame. So that look upon the whole, both parts joyn together: they walk on by pairs two and two, as the living creatures into the Ark, Male and Female. The firſt pair ſets forth to you the ſtate and condition of a godly man, he is <hi>righteous and merciful:</hi> thoſe are the male and female of Piety. The ſecond ſets forth to you the ſtate and condition of a dying man, he <hi>periſheth and is taken away:</hi> thoſe are the Male and Female of death. The third ſets out the ſtate and condition of a worldly man, he <hi>layes it not to heart, he never takes it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration:</hi> thoſe are the Male and Female of carnal ſecurity. And that all the pairs ſhould now be made up: the former part was handled at the burial of a good old Man: this latter now at the burial of an old and vertuous Gentlewoman: thoſe are the Male and Female of nature. The former part, that is a complaint that the Prophet made; and ſo is the ſecond; and this ſecond is ſet as a Commentary to the firſt; this latter part is as <hi>Eve</hi> created as a help to <hi>Adam,</hi> for every word in this latter helps to expound ſome word in the former.</p>
               <p>The firſt word in the latter part t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> us of the <hi>merciful man,</hi> that is the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the firſt word in the former part, <hi>the righteous man.</hi> Leſt any man ſhould make queſtion who this righteous man was, that the Prophet ſpeaks of, how we ſhould know him, and define him, and find him; find me a merciful man, and he is truly a righteous man.</p>
               <p>The ſecond word in the latter part is, <hi>taken away,</hi> that hath reference to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond word in the former, and it is a qualification of the harſhneſs of the former: there it is ſaid, <hi>The righteous man periſheth:</hi> but leſt any man ſhould ſcandal at this word, ſhall we think that he <hi>periſheth, whoſe life is hid with Chriſt in God?</hi> Shall the Scripture ſay that <hi>he periſheth,</hi> whoſe <hi>name is in the bundle of life, written in heaven?</hi> To lay aſide therefore the rigour of the word, here is the Qualification, <hi>he is taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third word of the latter hath reference to the third of the former too. <hi>No man conſidereth it.</hi> If any man ask the reaſon, how it comes to paſs, that people ſhould be without natural affection, that they take it not to heart, that they are not grieved for <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that they are not ſtriken with any ſenſe of their own loſſes, what ſhould be the reaſon of it? The reaſon is in this word, <hi>they take it not into conſideration:</hi> They trouble not their heads, &amp; therefore not their hearts with it. (That it may make an aggravation of that.) They were ſo far from taking of it to heart, that they never propounded it to the examination, and ſcanning of their judgment, <hi>they conſider it not.</hi> So every word in the latter part is ſerviceable to the firſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhewed concerning the firſt part, who this <hi>Righteous man is,</hi> how great the dignation of the Spirit of God is, that he will ſtile holy men, that are ſo imperfect in holineſs, yet becauſe of their holy endeavours to walk in the wayes of God blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, the Spirit ſtiles them <hi>Righteous men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſhewed how this <hi>Righteous man</hi> is ſaid <hi>to periſh:</hi> and it what ſenſe; and how it is impoſſible they ſhould <hi>periſh;</hi> and why the Holy Ghoſt chooſeth <hi>this word,</hi> which is more then death, to ſet out to us the death of the <hi>Righteous man.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap> this grieſe is to extend.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the heads of thoſe things that concerne the firſt part.</p>
               <p>I now go on forward to the ſecond.</p>
               <p>And that is a complaint (as the former was) that the Prophet takes up over the people of the <hi>Jewes</hi> for their great ſtupidity, in <hi>that they conſidered not</hi> any work of God toward them; And it hath theſe two parts.</p>
               <p>There is the complaint he takes up over the dead:
<note place="margin">The diviſion of the text.</note> 
                  <hi>Merciful men are taken away from the evil to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:47453:53"/>
And the other complaint he takes up over the living, thoſe that are living and ſurvive them, they care not though heaven and earth be mingled together, though they loſe all their props whereby the earth is ſupported, <hi>they never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe.
<note place="margin">The firſt part of the Text.</note> And that is;</p>
               <p>The complaint that is taken up over the <hi>Righteous mans</hi> departure.</p>
               <p>In that I conſider two things;</p>
               <p>Firſt, looke to the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>And then ſee,
<note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note> what were the motives that made the Prophet take up this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and lamentation: that whereas others wanted it, the Prophet ſhould ſupply it, and ſhould give teſtimony to their departure; <hi>The righteous are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt for the meaning of the words.
<note place="margin">1. Of the ſubject: Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is a propoſition, and there are three parts of it.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of the propoſition, <hi>Merciful men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Predicat, <hi>Are taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Affix anexed to it, <hi>from the evil to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Briefly, look upon the meaning of all theſe, and they will all afford us ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>The Firſt is the ſubject of this propoſition; It is ſaid here (and it varieth from the former) <hi>Merciful men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man would wonder why he ſhould alter the ſtile, except it were, becauſe the Spirit of God delighteth to ſet out godly men, according to the multitude of their titles, <hi>the righteous and mercyful men:</hi> Otherwiſe the ſame terme might have been kept in the latter part, for they are both the ſame in effect. He that is a <hi>merciful man,</hi> is a <hi>Righteous man,</hi> and he that is <hi>righteous</hi> will be <hi>merciful:</hi> yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet varieth it, <hi>righteous men periſh, and merciful men are taken away.</hi> There is ſome ſpecial reaſon of the variation. I conceive it is one of theſe three, or all.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon why he uſeth this word (<hi>merciful men</hi>) in the latter part is. For the greater conviction of their ſtupidity. They were ſuch as were not affected with the condition, or loſs of <hi>righteous</hi> and holy men; nay, they were ſo ſtupid, that they were not affected with the loſs of <hi>mercyful men,</hi> that is more. If there were any ſenſe of piety they ſhould for Gods cauſe grieve at the loſs of godly men: but if their were any ſenſe of their own good, there ſhould be grief for the loſs of <hi>merciful men.</hi> Generally (if it be poſſible to ſever them) the world hath more miſs of <hi>mercyful men,</hi> then of <hi>righteous men:</hi> every man ſhould mourn for their departure, and miſs them, though piety and righteouſneſs may go unmourned for. But theſe were come to that ſtupidity, that they had no ſight nor ſenſe of their own good: being a <hi>mercyful man,</hi> it is likely there were many naked that he had clothed, many ſtarved ſouls that he had ſed; there were parched bowels that he had ſimpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyzed with, he uſed to <hi>mourn with thoſe that mourn,</hi> to lament with thoſe that lament. Many Interpreters would have it ſpoken, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid this of himſelf, in regard of the perſecution that he ſuffered, (he was taken away by the Saw:) but whether it were of one <hi>merciful man,</hi> or of all, a man would think that <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyful men</hi> ſhould not go out of the world without mourners: there are Orphans and Widows, that will mourn for mercyful men, that have been relieved by them. Yet this ſtupidity ſo benumned them, in their own ſenſes they were ſo frozen, that they had no ſimpathy at all, neither reſpect to piety or mercy: <hi>Righteous men were taken away,</hi> and they looked not on that ſide, <hi>merciful men were taken away,</hi> and they looked not on that ſide neither. So it is an aggravation of their ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another reaſon why he varieth the word, <hi>Righteous men</hi> firſt, and <hi>merciful men</hi> after, is this; To ſhew how much God honoureth the works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Though it be a glorious title (<hi>A righteous man</hi>) yet the Spirit of God will not let him go without another title, A <hi>mercyful man. Righteouſneſs</hi> is beſt known to God, but <hi>mercifulneſs</hi> to men. <hi>Mercifulneſs</hi> is an evidence of piety and <pb n="94" facs="tcp:47453:54"/>godlineſs. <hi>Mercy</hi> is that grace that honoureth God moſt, and God honoureth it moſt. All the high Elogies that are given to piety in the Scripture, are ſpecially ſtated on <hi>mercy:</hi> God honoureth it with large and ample promiſes, <hi>Bleſſed are the mercyful, for they ſhall obtain mercy;</hi> It hath not the leaſt beatitude ſet to it, as <hi>Baſil</hi> of <hi>Seuleucia</hi> well obſerveth. God honoureth it likewiſe with an approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>When I was hungry ye fed me, when I was thirſty ye gave me drink:</hi> and with a publike approbation at the laſt day, in the preſence of Angels and men, it is <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> that God then magnifieth, <hi>Come ye bleſſed, when I was hungry ye fed me,</hi> &amp;c. God honoureth it likewiſe with an excellent memorial, he alwayes mentioneth it with honour; ſee it in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> ſee it in <hi>Job,</hi> ſee it in other Saints, they were noted for <hi>mercifulneſs</hi> in the Scripture; here in this place the ſpirit of God, becauſe the <hi>righteous man</hi> ſhall not go without an Epitaph, he makes on <hi>this righteous man</hi> a memorial. <hi>Merciful men are taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is the ſecond reaſon, that they might underſtand how farre God honoureth the works of Charity and mercy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Prophet might inſtruct them, and us now; who are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and accounted true righteous men. Thoſe that God accounteth ſo. And thoſe are <hi>merciful men.</hi> Theſe two, <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> they meet in God, ſo they muſt in every Chriſtian. They are the two wayes of God (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>all his wayes are mercy and righteouſneſs.</hi> They are the two wayes that Chriſt takes in the world: the firſt way, at his firſt coming, a coming of <hi>mercy;</hi> to call men to <hi>mercy;</hi> the ſecond at his ſecond coming, a coming of judgement, to judge the quick and the dead. So they are two wayes of God, ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard;</hi> They are the two feet of God, by which he walketh through the world: God viſiteth men upon one of theſe two feet, either in <hi>mercy,</hi> or <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:</hi> as they are the feet upon which God walketh to us; ſo they muſt be the two feet that we walk on toward God: <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is one, by which we tread the way of the firſt Table in works of piety to God: and <hi>mercy</hi> is the other, by which we tread the way of the ſecond Table, in mercy towards men. So that as the two Tables kiſs each other, they are infolded one in another; the love we owe to our brethren, it hangs and depends on our love to God: the love that we ſhew to God, is to be teſtified by our love to our brethren: So theſe two are to embrace one another, we muſt not ſever them that God ſevereth not: according to this, others will judge of us that we are truly righteons, according to this ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling we take of our ſelves. Deceive not your ſelves if their be not works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and <hi>mercy,</hi> ſlatter not your ſelves with an oppinion of <hi>righteouſneſs;</hi> it is an empty name where <hi>mercy</hi> is not. So the Apoſtle makes the argument, <hi>He that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.20.</note> 
                  <hi>how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi> So likewiſe here, is it poſſible that there ſhould be <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> toward God, when there is not <hi>mercy</hi> toward men?</p>
               <p>It is the firſt of thoſe pious inſtructions, that I will commend to this place. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> there is a great deal in the world, men deſire to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted godly men, becauſe they can be reſerved to themſelves. They can get pretences of piety, and zealous they will ſeem to be for works of the firſt Table. Did God give only one Table? No: but we ſhall be tried by the works of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table; <hi>When I was hungry yee fed me not, when I was thirſty ye gave me no drink.</hi> Why do we make boaſt of piety to God, that men cannot judge of? For there is one little grain of hypocriſie that ſpoileth all. We may act mercy to men but we cannot act piety: piety will ſhew it ſelf here; Here is the touch-ſtone to give proof of the piety in our hearts, if it bud out in <hi>mercy:</hi> the <hi>righteous man is mereiful</hi> in every kind. Where there is piety, there will not be reviling, and diſgracing, and quarrelling, and contention: it is impoſſible that piety in the heart ſhould be contentious, that pure and untainted liquor ſhould paſs through a filthy kennel: if there be grace in the heart, it will ſhew it ſelf in the hand, in the lip, in the words, in the actions, in all. It is but a touch that I give you, I know you eaſily gheſs where I am. I come not to put you in mind of what you know: or rather to put you in mind. I am not conſcious to your courſes, but <pb n="95" facs="tcp:47453:54"/>I will tell ye what the world faith; It is a great deal of wrong done to this pariſh, and this place, if there be not much contention in it: and it is not upon this occaſion that I heard it, for before now I never knew any one in the pariſh, but as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle faith of the good works of one of theſe Churches, <hi>It is ſpoken of in all the world,</hi> ſo the ſtrife of this place is ſpoken of in all the City. Here is the fruit whereby you muſt examine you ſelves, mercy to men. If we be not thoſe that nouriſh bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love, there will be no mercy: there is no mercy, where there are the fruits of uncharitableneſs, and if there be no mercy, there will be no piety. Let this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be the touch-ſtone of piety;
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.18.</note> love, and peace with men, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; <hi>As much as is poſſible have peace with all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will ſpeak no more of the meaning of the firſt part, <hi>Marciful men are taken away.</hi> It is the Commentary upon the former</p>
               <p>The ſecond is the Predicate of the Propoſition,
<note place="margin">2. Of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat, they periſh.</note> 
                  <hi>they are taken away,</hi> that hath reference to this, <hi>they periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is great wiſdom in the Spirit of God thus to expound one word by another. That as in the body of a man,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.</note> thoſe parts that are of moſt uſe, God in wiſdom hath made them double, hath made them pairs, two eyes, two hands, two ears, &amp;c. (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe are parts of great uſe) that if one part fall away and miſcarry, the other part may ſupply; if one eye be out, a man loſeth not his ſight, he hath another, and ſo in other parts: ſo it is in the Scripture; if we miſtake one word, here is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother that is more plain to lead us right in the meaning of the Scripture: for elſe men would have been offended: <hi>Godly men periſh;</hi> That is more then to die, that that periſheth is loſt. But it is plain, they are not loſt in death. Periſhing is one ſtep beyond death? If it had been predicated of mercileſs, impenitent, unrighteous men, it might have been ſaid ſo, they periſh, they not only die. But <hi>what hath the righteous done? who ever periſhed being innocent?</hi> Who ever ſuſpected and dreamed, that it was poſſible for <hi>merciful men to periſh?</hi> Here cometh in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: No, be not deceived; It is a word frequently uſed in the world, carnall men think ſo, but they periſh not, they are but <hi>took away.</hi> Ye ſee how one word helpeth the other: ſo this word giveth us aſſurance of the meaning of this Scripture, and of the ſtate and condition of a <hi>merciful man,</hi> he periſheth not, though the Atheiſts of the world think ſo: he <hi>periſheth</hi> not to himſelf, for then beginneth his happineſs, when death cometh: though they <hi>periſh</hi> to mens memorial and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, there is no <hi>remembrance of the wiſe man, more then of the fool</hi> (ſaith <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>) that is, worldly men, that mind the world, and their bellies, they take no more to conſideration, when a <hi>righteous man,</hi> a <hi>wiſe man</hi> dieth, then a <hi>fool;</hi> that is, an impenitent man, though I ſay they <hi>periſh</hi> to the memorial of the world, they <hi>periſh</hi> not to God; not to the fruition of his happineſs, for Death is but a porter, a bridge to everlaſting life, then beginneth their glory: Heaven that was begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a miſtery, then it is ſet open to them literally and perſonally. They periſh not becauſe they are taken away, there is the proof of it. A man that is removed only from an Inn, no man will ſay that he is loſt. That that is tranſplanted from one ſoil to another, doth not periſh. A graſt or ſyens, though it be cut off, and it is to have a more noble plantation; It is ſo far from periſhing, that it is more perfect, it is ſtabliſhed in its nature, it is ſet into a better.</p>
               <p>There are but one of theſe two interpretations of <hi>periſhing,</hi> and neither of them can befal a godly <hi>merciful</hi> man. Either it is a paſſage from a beeing, to a not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and ſo the Beaſts when they die, <hi>periſh,</hi> becauſe their ſouls are mortal, as well as their bodies: it is no more a living creature, there is no more life it it, it reſolveth to its firſt principles; the ſoul it is nourſhed as well as the body, there was a beeing before, but now there is a nullity of beeing, in reſpect of a living creature, there is nothing liveth. Here is a <hi>periſhing</hi> from a beeing, to a not beeing.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>periſhing</hi> may be a paſſage from a beeing to a worſe beeing: ſo an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent man when he dieth, he paſſeth from life to death; yea, to an eternal death, to a worſe beeing; that is, a <hi>periſhing,</hi> and a proper <hi>periſhing,</hi> that is worſe then to be loſt. It is better to have no beeing, then to have either of theſe.</p>
               <p>But in neither of theſe ſenſes the <hi>righteous man periſheth:</hi> he hath a beeing and a 
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47453:55"/>well-beeing after death. His ſoul hath a eral beeing with God in happineſs, his body hath a beeing of hope, though it be in the grave; Nay, it hath a real beeing of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as it is a member of Chriſt, in regard of the myſtical union. So in no ſenſe he <hi>periſheth,</hi> he is but <hi>took away,</hi> he is but removed, it is but <hi>Exodus,</hi> but <hi>tranſitus:</hi> his death is not a going out of the Candle, it is but a tranſlation, a removing of it to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter frame, it is ſet upon a more glorious table to ſhine more bright. The word is well expounded in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. concerning <hi>Enoch:</hi> whereas in the fifth of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>Enoch walked with God, and God took him;</hi> in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>he was tranſlated.</hi> In the one, he was <hi>took away,</hi> that is, in reſpect of the world; In the other, <hi>he was tranſlated;</hi> that is, in reſpect of heaven. They are <hi>tock away;</hi> that is, from the place of miſery, the Dungeon, the priſon, to a place of glory and happineſs. They are <hi>took away</hi> from the <hi>houſe of clay,</hi> to the <hi>houſe Eternal, not made with hands, in the heavens:</hi> they are <hi>tranſlated</hi> upward, that is meant in this.</p>
               <p>So that there are two obſervations in this.<lb/>
Firſt,
<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> 
                  <hi>That Piety and Mercy excuſeth not from death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Godlineſs it ſelf freeth not a man from death. Death it is that end that is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all men. The bodies of godly men are of the ſame mould and temper, of the ſame frame and conſtitution as other men, their fleſh is as frail, their humours as cholerick, their ſpirit as ſading, their breath as vaniſhing, they owe the ſame debt to nature, to ſin, to God, to themſelves and their own happineſs. They are bound under the weight of the ſame Law, the ſtatute law is; <hi>It is appointed to all men to die once.</hi> It is well ſaid, <hi>to die once,</hi> for the impenitent man dieth twice, he dieth here by the ſeparation of his ſoul from his body, that is the firſt death; and there is the ſecond death that ſucceedeth that; the death of the ſoul, by a ſeparation of it from God, which is far worſe. But <hi>righteous and merciful men die once;</hi> the firſt death ſeizeth upon them: <hi>It is appointed to all: It is the end of all fleſh;</hi> In one place: <hi>It is the end of all the earth,</hi> in another place: It is the end of all living, the end of all men, even <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>godly men</hi> are brought within the compaſs of this law of Nature, to yeeld up this debt and due. Righteouſneſs excuſes not, it frees not. It is a law that bindeth one as well as another. As <hi>Baſil</hi> of <hi>Seuleucia</hi> obſerveth, though <hi>Adam</hi> was the firſt that finned, yet <hi>Abel</hi> was the firſt that died: <hi>Adam</hi> committed the tranſgreſtion, the elder ſon was <hi>Cain,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Abel,</hi> in the courſe of nature the eldeſt ſhould have gone firſt, but <hi>Abel,</hi> righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> that was the moyty, the half of his comfort, and the greater half, though the younger: <hi>Adam</hi> ſinneth firſt, and yet righteous <hi>Abel</hi> dieth <hi>firſt.</hi> He gives the reaſon to be this, becauſe God would let us ſee in the Portal of death, the table of the Reſurrection, he would ſhew us the linnaments of the Reſurrection in the firſt man that dieth, that <hi>righteous Abel is took away,</hi> that we ſhould be aſſured that he was but <hi>tranſlated,</hi> there was hope of the Reſurrection confirmed even in his death. But yet that is not all; the reaſon (I conceive) that is more proper to this is: righteous <hi>Abal</hi> dieth firſt, to ſhew that even <hi>righteous and merciful men</hi> muſt not expect immunity from death, and from ſuffering tribulation in this world; it is the condition that befalleth <hi>Abel</hi> the righteous, as well as <hi>Cain</hi> the Phariſee; It belongeth to <hi>faithful Abraham,</hi> as well as to <hi>Apoſtatizing Gemas: to beloved Jacob,</hi> as well as to <hi>reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Eſau:</hi> to <hi>meek Moſes,</hi> as well as to <hi>curſing Shemei:</hi> to <hi>Deborah</hi> the <hi>Propheteſs,</hi> as well as to <hi>uſurping Athaliah:</hi> to devout <hi>Joſiah,</hi> as well as to <hi>impious Ahab:</hi> to <hi>tender-hearted David,</hi> as well as to <hi>churliſh Nabal;</hi> to the <hi>humble</hi> Publican, as well as to the <hi>vaunting</hi> Phariſee. It is the law and rule that is ſet to all, there is no exemption: righteouſneſs, piety, and works of mercy, then do not exempt.</p>
               <p>Eor if they could exempt, how ſhould piety have the reward? when ſhould godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come to the full recompence? It is death that makes way to the hope of reward.</p>
               <p>And if it be ſo, that righteouſneſs excuſeth not, then neither honour, nor ſtrength, nor beauty, nor riches, can excuſe in the world: for theſe are of far leſs prevalency with God then piety. So the Argument ſtandeth ſtrongly, If <hi>Job</hi> died that was a <hi>merciful</hi> man; if <hi>Abel</hi> was taken away that was a <hi>righteous</hi> man, look to other conditions: then <pb n="97" facs="tcp:47453:55"/>
                  <hi>Caſar,</hi> that is the Princes of the world ſhall be cut off, their ſtate and pompe ſhall not keep them: then <hi>Creſſus</hi> that is the rich men of the world, ſhall die, their purſe and plenty, ſhall not excuſe them: then <hi>Socrates,</hi> that is, the prudent and learned men of the world, their wiſdom ſhall not prevent it: then <hi>Helena,</hi> that is, the Minnions of the world, the decking of their bodies, and their beauty, and painting ſhall be ſetched off, they will expoſe them to death, they ſhall not free them: then <hi>Sampſon,</hi> that is, the ſtrong men of the world, thoſe that are healthy, of able parts, likely to out-live nature, their ſtrength ſhall not excuſe them: that no man ſhould glory in any thing without, <hi>Neither the strong man in his ſtrength, nor the wiſe man in his wiſdom, or the rich man in his wealth, but if he glory in any thing, to glory in the Lord.</hi> Though we muſt not boaſt our ſelves of piety, yet as the A poſtle ſaith, <hi>yea have compelled me.</hi> If a man may boaſt of any thing, it is of piety, that is, rejoyce in this. If God have made a man a veſſel of mercy, and an inſtrument of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any good: but otherwiſe to boaſt of it, even that ſhall be the ſtain, and further diſgrace of it: for <hi>righteouſneſs it ſelf excuſes not from death;</hi> all are ſubject to the ſame law, that is the firſt obſervation; <hi>Mercifull men are taken away</hi> as well as others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a difference in the manner, though they be ſubject to death, yet it is a ſubjection under another ſubjection: Death is made ſubject to them, they conquer Death. So both ſtand together, they die, and not die, becauſe their death is but a tranſlation, but a removing.</p>
               <p>There are two perſons, two men in every penitent and godly man; there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a righteous man, and ſomewhat of a ſinner; ſomewhat of the fleſh, and ſomewhat of the ſpirit: ſo according to theſe two, both laws are kept: the Law of commination, that is kept, <hi>thou ſhall die the death;</hi> there is the reward of ſin; the law of promiſe, that is kept, <hi>thou ſhall live for ever;</hi> there is the reward of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Mortality giveth the reward to ſin, immortality to piety.</p>
               <p>Though they die, <hi>they are but taken away.</hi> The word implies theſe two things;</p>
               <p>Firſt, it implies that their death is but a temporary death. Taking away is not a final tranſlation, it doth not implie a nullity. Death, though it cut the knot of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet not grace. It is true, there is the ſharp Axe of death, there is no knot ſo <hi>Gordian,</hi> but it will cut it a funder. It is a great knot that was firſt knit between the body and the ſoul, it cutteth that aſunder. It is a ſure knot, which is the Conjugal knot between man and wife, it cutteth that aſunder. There is a natural bond and union between Parents and children, it cuts that aſunder. There is a civil union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween friend and friend, it cuts that knot aſunder, it takes one friend from another. But there is the myſtical union between the head and the members, between Chriſt and the Church, it cannot cut that knot aſunder. But look as Chriſts body in the Grave, it was not deprived of the Hypoſtatical union, ſo likewiſe the body of a Saint, when it lies in the grave, in corruption, it is <hi>mellowing</hi> for immoratlity, and eternity: yea, then it enjoyeth the benefit of the miſtical Union, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of a member of Chriſt that lies in the grave: that duſt that the body of a Saint is reſolved into, it is <hi>holy Duſt,</hi> becauſe that miſtical Union is not cut aſunder; Death cutteth not that knot. It perfecteth the miſticall Union in reſpect of the ſoul, and it is but an interruption of the manifeſtation of the union in reſpect of the body, it is never ſevered. As the Husbandman hath ſome corne in his ground, and ſome in his Barn: the Corn in his ground is of no leſs value and account, then that in his houſe and Barn; Nay, it is of more, for that that is in his Barn ſhall not multiply, ſo many buſhels he putteth up, and ſo many he receiveth, but that which is in the ground multipiles, therefore it is in as great account. So it is with God. There are many bodies of the Saints walking on the earth; and thoſe that are laid in the grave, that <hi>are ſowen</hi> (as the Apoſtle faith) <hi>for immortality.</hi> The bodies of the Saints in the grave, are of no leſſe account with God, then thoſe which walk up and down in the world, and gloriſie him with works of piety: why? the body is ſown to immortality, there is ſtill ſomewhat of Chriſt. That is the firſt thing it implies; <hi>They are taken away,</hi> it argues, <hi>that their death is temporary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:47453:56"/>
Secondly, it ſheweth it is <hi>deliberate,</hi> that their death is not ſudden. For there is a difference between theſe two, to be ſnatched away, and to be <hi>taken away.</hi> Impenitent men when they are <hi>taken away</hi> in Judgement, they are ſnatched away in diſpleaſure. The godly man, God takes him away, removes him, it is as gentle a word as could be uſed, there cannot be a better word to expreſs it in our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then for God <hi>to take him away. Job</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſſed it ſo, and ſo <hi>Iſaiah</hi> here, to ſhew that Death is never ſudden to the <hi>merciful and righheous man,</hi> Why? becauſe he is alwayes prepared. It may be ſudden in reſpect of others, but not to himſelf. The ſtroke of Death may be the ſame to a <hi>righteous man,</hi> as to an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent man, they may both fall by the prevalency of the ſame diſeaſe, the ſame duration of ſickneſs, the ſame warning given them, the ſame ſympathy; but there is a difference in regard of the ſuddenneſs.</p>
               <p>If it be a ſudden ſtroke that overtakes an impenitent man, then it is two wayes ſudden; even a premeditated death is ſudden to him, becauſe he is not prepared: ſudden death cometh not to a prepared man, becauſe he looks for it: it may (as I ſaid) be ſudden to others, but it is not to himſelf, Why? becauſe he expects Death, he <hi>dieth dayly,</hi> he dieth in his thoughts, before he dies in act, he dies in meditation, before he dies in paſſion: <hi>I die daily,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, Death when it came to the Apoſtle, it found him dying, it could not come ſuddenly to him; Death finds him ſetting open the doors: therefore though it ſeem ſudden death, it cannot be ſudden, becauſe he is <hi>taken away:</hi> the ſtroke of Death may be ſudden, but the iſſue of death is not ſudden: the ſtroke may be ſudden to his body, but not to his mind; becauſe he fitteth himſelf, ſtill for it. There is the deliberation implied in the word, his death is not ſudden, in that he is prepared: God awaketh his heart to make him look for it, therefore when Death comech though ſooner or later, it doth but take him, it ſhatcheth him not away; that is the meaning of the ſecond.</p>
               <p>The third word is,
<note place="margin">3. Of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: from the evil to come.</note> the extent of this act, <hi>from the evil to come:</hi> that is a word that is not ſpecified in the former part: it makes both this and that the more full; it makes a greater demonſtration of Gods goodneſs: he is not only merciful in <hi>taking away,</hi> but he <hi>takes away</hi> from that that is <hi>evil,</hi> he takes from a bad eſtate to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. An evil that is preſent, that is ſimply ſo: an Evil for the time to come, God takes righteous and merciful men from both.</p>
               <p>That I may lay a ſit path for my proceeding in it, Saint <hi>Auſt in</hi> devideth the nature of Evil well to thoſe two heads: there is the Evil of doing, and the evil of ſuffering, that is, the evil of ſin, and of puniſhment. The firſt of theſe, the <hi>Evil of ſin,</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite (faith <hi>Aquinas</hi>) to the increated good. The ſecond, the Evil of puniſhment, is oppoſite to the created good. God takes away merciful men from both theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 From the evil to ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</note> from the Evil of ſuffering. Two wayes he is took from that. He is took away from the <hi>Evil of ſuffering,</hi> that he ſhall not ſee it, and that he ſhall not undergo it, and endure it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">That he ſhall not ſee it.</note> that he <hi>ſhall not ſee it,</hi> that he ſhall not be a ſepectator: that is one part of <hi>taking away.</hi> For <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> men have tender affections, and yearning bowels, when they ſee Gods judgements extended over any place or perſon; they ſympathize with them, they <hi>weep with thoſe that weep, and mourn with thoſe that mourn.</hi> God takes them from this ſorrow and mourning.</p>
               <p>It hath alwayes been accounted one part of the happineſs of a godly man, to be taken from the Evil of the place he liveth in. God <hi>takes Joſiah from the evil to come.</hi> Saint <hi>Jerom</hi> ſheweth it well in <hi>Nepotian,</hi> he makes this as an Argument amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that his departure was a comfort and happineſs to him, becauſe (ſaith he) <hi>Nepotian is happy that he ſees not thoſe Evils, and calamities, and miſeries that are now come on the Church that we ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, not only in the eſteem of godly, and righteous, and Chriſtian men, but in the eſteem of the Heathens it was accounted a happineſs to die before a man ſee the miſeries on the place he wiſheth well to. <hi>Virgil</hi> in the eleventh of his AEniads, bringeth in <hi>Vandall,</hi> making a lamentation over his ſon <hi>Pallas</hi> that was ſlain; after many tears that were ſhed over him, and doleful words that were paſt: the Poet bringeth in his wife, and faith, it was her happineſs to die before him, that ſhe ſaw <pb n="99" facs="tcp:47453:56"/>not this miſery: the Poet accounted her happy that ſhe died before, and ſaw not the miſery that was brought on that place, and her husband. In his eſteem then it is one point of happineſs, <hi>to be taken away before that Evil come upon a place we wiſh well too.</hi> He expreſſeth himſelf in another place, in the firſt of his AEniads, <hi>They are happy that die before their Country,</hi> before they ſee the ruin of that. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be a great happineſs for a Chriſtian to be <hi>taken away</hi> before miſery come upon the Church. Here is one reſpect the Lord hath, he takes them away that they do not ſee the Evil he bringeth on a place.</p>
               <p>Secondly;
<note place="margin">That he ſhall not endure it.</note> That <hi>they ſhould not ſuffer it,</hi> that is a further degree and a greater. So we ſee that it is the happineſs that is intailed on other ſervants of God; Though it is not a courſe that God alwayes conſtantly keepeth: ſometime he ſuffereth godly men to live, and to be ſwept away in common calamities, as the Plague, Famine, Sword, and the like, even <hi>righteous men periſh</hi> in theſe times, that is the courſe that God ſometimes takes. On the other ſide ſometime he takes this courſe, that he will preſerve them in the middeſt of danger, he will keep them alive: he ſendeth calamities, and plagues, and yet he preſerveth the righteous. So in the Revelation, he commandeth the Angel to <hi>ſeal his ſervants on the forehead,</hi> when he poureth his curſes on the Earth:
<note place="margin">Ezek, 9</note> ſo in the ninth of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> he ſpeaks to the man with a ſlaughter weapon, to <hi>mark thoſe that mourned,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> to paſſe them by: So in <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth <hi>the bloud to be ſprinkled on the poſts of the doors, that the Angel may paſſe by:</hi> So God when he ſeeth his mark, the bloud of the Covenant on the head of his ſervants, he paſſeth them by in common calamities: ſometimes I ſay he takes that courſe. But he is not tyed to one courſe alwayes: ſometimes, he <hi>takes away</hi> his ſervants <hi>from the Evil to come,</hi> he doth not ſuffer them to have the ſorrow of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or feeling of it.</p>
               <p>God when he intendeth to ſmite the Earth with plagues and curſes, he will make this way for his courſe, he will remove the obſtables, the Saints that are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments; they hold Gods hands, they wreſtle by prayer, they prevaile by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, they caſt down themſelves, and ſtand in the gap: that he may unwind his hands of this burthen, of the prayers of his ſervants, he removeth them by death, he ſaith to them as he did to <hi>Moſes, let me alone that I may deſtroy them.</hi> And then, as it is with the Husbandman, when the corn is gotten into his Barn, he burneth up the ſtuble: till the Wheat be gathered, the Tares are not turned up. God will not pour his plagues untill he have removed the impediments, thoſe that are <hi>merciful men,</hi> when they are <hi>taken away,</hi> he poureth down his judgements. Therefore he <hi>takes them away,</hi> that they may not ſee it, nor ſuffer it, that is the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. From the evil of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> he takes them from the Evil of ſinning, that is a greater bleſſing, and in two ſenſes from that. He takes them from it. that they ſhall not ſee ſin, for that is a great Corroſive to a godly man. It was one point of <hi>Davids</hi> grievance, that he ſaw wicked men ſuffer;
<note place="margin">That he ſhall not ſee ſin com mitted by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> 
                  <hi>I humbled my ſoul with faſting, and I behaved my ſelf as one that mourned for his Mother. David</hi> humbled himſelf even for his enemies, when they were afflictied, that was one part of his ſorrow. But the chief part of his ſorrow was to ſee them commit ſin, <hi>Mine eyes guſh out with rivers of tears, becauſe men keep not thy law;</hi> That was a great affliction. Therefore that they may be eaſed of that evil, <hi>God takes away merciful men, that they ſhall not ſee ſins committed;</hi> they are offenſive to chaſte eyes. He takes them to heaven, that their ears may not be filled with helliſh blaſphemies, and damnable oathes that overburthen the ground, that ring their peals in every ſtreet, as a man paſſeth by: there is no hearing ſuch things in heaven. That is one thing, he takes them away, that their eyes may not be glutted with beholding extortions, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, murthers, contentions, revilings, and other ſins in the world. It is a great eaſe to a godly man to be took out of evil times: when God lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him in times and places that are evil, he ſhines as a light: when God takes him away, he hath the reward of his ſorrow: it coſt him grief to ſee it, therefore to reward him, <hi>God takes him away, that he may not ſee ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:47453:57"/>
Fourthly,
<note place="margin">That he ſhall not commit ſin himſelf.</note> God takes them away, that they may mot ſin themſelves: for heaven is a place as of no ſorrow, ſo of no ſin: though we be unſatiable of ſin now, then there is an end put to it. It pleaſeth God ſo to deal, in his providence to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, that ſin brought in Death, and Death carrieth out ſin: that as a skilful Chimmick diſtilleth an Antidote out of poyſon, ſo doth God; Death that was the reward of ſin, God ſetcheth the tranſlation out of it to eternal happineſs: the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſin, brought forth Death, and Death the daughter carrieth out ſin. That is it that is the great comfort of a man in death: as now I ſhall ceaſe ſuffering, ſo here is my comfort too, I ſhll ceaſe ſinning: though my purpoſes and endeavours be bent upon piety, yet I am overtaken; I could not tread ſo ſtrait, but I did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tread awry; now there ſhall be a new plain path provided for my feet, there is no ſin in heaven.</p>
               <p>That is a great point of wiſdome, that God deſtroyeth ſin with the body, and raiſeth the body again without ſin: if the body ſhould live alwayes, how ſhould ſin end? ſin will not be rooted out, as long as we are in the body; while we carry about us this <hi>vaile of fleſh,</hi> we ſhall carry about us alſo another <hi>vaile of ſin:</hi> therefore faith <hi>Epiphanius, God dealeth with us, as a skilful houſhoulder with his houſe.</hi> Look as it is in building an old houſe, if there grow a Fig-tree, or Ivy out of the houſe, that it ſpred the root through the chincks and partitions of the wall, a man that cuts down the Fig-tree ſhall not profit, for it is ſo faſt rooted in the wall, and in the chincks, that either he muſt pull down the wall, or elſe it will not die; Therefore a wiſe man will pull down his houſe, and root out the Fig-tree and then ſet up ſtones, and there erect the houſe beautiful, and ſo both are preſerved: he hath his end in both, both the houſe is rebuilt, and the Ivy conſumed and rooted out. So it is in caſe of ſin, there is the houſe we carry about us, the building, the temple of our body, the houſe is man himſelf, ſin is the fig-tree, it is ſuch a fig-tree as inſinuateth it ſelf between every chink, and partition in our nature; there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what corrupt in every faculty of the ſoul, and it ſheweth the fruit in every part of the body, that is an inſtrument of ſin: it hath ſo wound it ſelf in, that the fig-tree cannot be deſtroyed, cannot be pulled out, except the houſe be diſſolved, there muſt be a pulling down of the Temple: therefore God in wiſdome, by Death he takes the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the houſe in peeces, and then the fig-tree may be pulled out; and then he erects the wall of that houſe more glorious then before it was thrown down, while the fig- tree was in it, while ſin was in it: it is raiſed up without it; that is that the Apoſtle faith, <hi>Corruption ſhall put on incorruption, and mortality ſhall put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, the body that is ſown a naturall body, it ſhall be raiſed a ſpiritual, it is ſown in diſhonour, it ſhall be raiſed in glory.</hi> God therefore <hi>takes them away from the evil of ſin,</hi> he diſſolved the body, that he may purifie it, and cloath it with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, that it may be a purer body, then when it was firſt preſented in nature at the firſt Creation.</p>
               <p>We ſee hereby what thoſe good things are that Death bringeth; It bringeth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from the evil of ſuffering: God <hi>takes away merciful men,</hi> that they ſee not, that they ſuffer not. And it bringeth immunity from ſin, that they do not ſee it, that they do not commit it.</p>
               <p>The uſe is a Pillar of conſidence,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi>
                  </note> not to be afraid of Death: who would fear that which makes for his perfection, that is the means of his tranſlation of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
               <p>And in reſpect of others, not to mourn for them that are took away out of this world, as thoſe that are without hope: they are not <hi>took away</hi> but <hi>tranſlated:</hi> they are removed for their advantage, for the better. <hi>Elijah</hi> was removed from earth to heaven <hi>in a firie chariot,</hi> ſhall <hi>Eliſha</hi> weep becauſe he enjoyeth him not? No he is took from earth to heaven; <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſold into AEgypt, but it was to be a Ruler, God intended that: it is the ſame reaſon, God tranſlates us out of the world, to give us <hi>the end of our hope, even the ſalvation of our ſouls;</hi> Shall we mourn as men without hope? God takes them out of a <hi>valley of tears,</hi> ſhall we mourn unſatiably for thoſe that are took out of the <hi>valley of tears?</hi> Let us not bring their memory to the <hi>valley of tears,</hi> they are paſt it. God takes them from evil <pb n="101" facs="tcp:47453:57"/>to good, to the beſt good, the good of immortaity, and eternity, the good of the enjoying of God, <hi>of that that eye hath not ſeen, nor ear hath heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, that when we ſee any impenitent man die, any man die in his ſins, there is juſt cauſe of mourning. That was the courſe that <hi>David</hi> obſerved: he loſt two ſons, <hi>Abſolom</hi> a wicked ſonne, he mourned for him; he loſt the child that was begotten in adultery, for the life of which he prayed; he mourned not for the childs departure: and Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> giveth the reaſon well, he had a good hope and aſſurance that the child was tranſlated to a better eſtate, he doubted of <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> he died in his ſins, therefore he mourned for him, for his death, not for the childs. So when we ſee any die in his fins, there is cauſe then of tears, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive tears: then <hi>David</hi> crieth, <hi>Abſolom, oh my ſon, my ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if there be good evidences of a Saint tranſlated to glory, ſhall we <hi>mourn as men without hope?</hi> As Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Paula</hi> mourning for her daughter; <hi>Art thou angry Paula, becauſe I have made thy child mine?</hi> (He bringeth in God ſpeaking thus) <hi>doſt thou envy me my own poſſeſſion? my own Creature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, for the ſtate of an impenitent man, he hath his good things here, and his evill to come after, there is cauſe of mourning, for that he is tranſlated from good to ill; his heaven is in this world, his heaven is in his treaſure, in his riches, in his cheſts, and upon his table; and as he enjoyed a heaven here, ſo he muſt not look for it after, there is a place of another condition, his heaven is here, his hell after.</p>
               <p>But the penitent and contrite, his ill is here, and his good after, his hell is in this world in ſuffering, and in mortifying the fleſh, in wraſtling with ſin, in incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with tentations, here is his hell, and his torments, but after cometh his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and his bliſs, ſo he is tranſlated from bad to good, he is took away from the evil to come.</p>
               <p>So here is the meaning of all. I have ſhewed firſt the meaning of the three phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing I propound is this; What the Prophet bemoaneth, and makes lamentation for, and theſe <hi>merciful men</hi> for if they be <hi>took away</hi> from evil preſent and evil to come,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi>
                  </note> evil corporal and ſpiritual, ſufferings extraordinary, plague and famine; ſufferings ordinary, ſickneſs and tentation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> if it be ſo that no ſin ſhall fall upon them to deſtruction, no tentation fall on them to deſtroy them here, much leſs afterward; if they be <hi>took</hi> from all theſe evils, how cometh the Prophet to make lamentation, that <hi>merciful men are taken away from the evil to come?</hi> for he ſpeaks it mourningly.</p>
               <p>It is one ſufficient reaſon, he mourneth over them becauſe others did not.</p>
               <p>But there are two reaſons that are more ſpecial.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> There is the loſs of the godly man for the preſent <hi>when he is taken away;</hi> that is a thing to be lamented; And the danger of the world in reſpect of the loſs of a godly man.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">The loſs of a godly man, a great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a place</note> the loſs of a godly man, that is a great puniſhment that God ſendeth on a place, there is a great loſs to thoſe that ſurvive.</p>
               <p>The loſs of their example: they ſhine as lights, there is a Taper, a Candle taken away; <hi>Ye rejoyced to walk in his light,</hi> faith Chriſt, to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> concerning <hi>John;</hi> there was a light not only of <hi>Johns</hi> Doctrine, but of his example, whereby thoſe that heard him walked. There is the light of grace ſet up in the life of the Saints of God: they are as a Taper to guide us in the paths of mercy and piety that they tread in. <hi>Job</hi> was ſet up a <hi>light of patience: Abraham</hi> of <hi>faith: Corneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of <hi>Charity:</hi> and ſo every grace that the Saints are eminent in, they are ſet up as ſo many lights. When the light is gone, is there not a great loſs to have a candle put out? Though they enjoy their light, we loſe it, the benefit of their example and ſociety; their advice and counſel. Oh the experience of the Saints, bring a great deal of good to their acquaintance: I am in this affliction, I remember that you were in the ſame caſe, how did you carry your ſelf? It is a great matter to build upon the experiences of the Saints of God.</p>
               <p>We loſe many benefits by loſing of a Saint. He is not only beneficial in his example, but in his prayers. He is one of the <hi>Advocates of the world,</hi> that pleads <pb n="102" facs="tcp:47453:58"/>with God, that <hi>ſtands in the gap. Abraham</hi> was a ſtrong <hi>Advocate</hi> for <hi>Sodome,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Moſes</hi> for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſo other Saints in their time. The Saints while they live in the world, there is a great deal of power in their prayers to with-hold judgements: and is there then no loſs when they are taken away?</p>
               <p>When a Saint is removed, a Pillar is removed, a Pillar of the houſe, and of the Earth, and muſt there not be danger when the Pillar is gone? They are the <hi>Corner ſtones:</hi> when a corner ſtone falleth, there is a great deal of traſh and rubbiſh falleth with it.</p>
               <p>There is a great deale of diſcomfort upon the fall of a Saint.</p>
               <p>When God removeth godly and <hi>merciful men,</hi> there is a loſs every way: to the Church, to the State. The Church loſeth a member, the State a Pillar; godly men loſe an example, wicked men loſe an advocate, poor men loſe a Patron, all men loſe a comfort.</p>
               <p>That is the fitſt thing the Prophet bemoaneth in the loſs of <hi>righteous men.</hi> Firſt it went to his heart that the world ſhould be left empty of piety, and all thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous examples, that God ſhould cut off thoſe precious plants, thoſe that are looking-glaſſes for us to ſee our ſelves in, and that pitch of perfection we ſhould breath after, and aime at. That is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>But that is not all: for their was impendant danger when they were gone. It is a prognoſticating of ſome evil to befal a place, when God takes them away. If <hi>Noah</hi> enter into the Ark, the world may expect a deluge. If <hi>Lot</hi> be out of <hi>Sodome,</hi> let it look for a ſhowr of fire and brimſtone: God himſelf expreſſeth himſelf by the Angel that <hi>he could do nothing</hi> as long as <hi>Los</hi> was in <hi>Sodome;</hi> he had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion not to rain fire and brimſtone while <hi>Lot</hi> was there, while <hi>Lots</hi> perſon and prayers were there: aſſoon as <hi>Lot</hi> was gone, there cometh a cloud of Judgment: and in that a ſhowre. So the Saints when they are tranſlated into the Ark; when they are took from the earth as <hi>Noah</hi> was, (<hi>Noah</hi> was to aſcend from the earth to the Ark) when <hi>Lot</hi> is gone to the City God provided for him, the City of refuge, then we may expect one Judgment or other, for they are means to hinder, and keep them from being poured out.</p>
               <p>That is the ſecond thing in the loſs of righteous men. They are took away for their good, but for our ill: we have loſt the benefit of their example, the comfort of their ſociety, and now we may fear that Judgments will come plentifully: <hi>for merciful men are taken away from the evill to come.</hi> So I have done with the firſt part of the Complaint.</p>
               <p>I will be very briefe in the ſecond:
<note place="margin">The ſecond part of the Text.</note> that is, over the living, <hi>no man conſidereth it:</hi> this is truly to be bemoaned. There is a doudle extent, firſt of the Act, <hi>they conſider not;</hi> And then an extent of the perſon, <hi>no man conſidereth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Act hath a great latitude. It is either an aggravation of the former: <hi>they lay it not to heart,</hi> nay, <hi>they do not take it into conſideration:</hi> or elſe it is a rendring a reaſon of the former; <hi>they lay it not to heart, becauſe they bethink not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſideration is an act of the judicial part of the underſtanding, as incogitancy is a rocking of reaſon aſleep, a ſhuting of the doore of reaſon. Neglect, that is a negligence of due care to be taken: on the other ſide, inconſideration or inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitancy, that is a neglect of the due courſe of reaſon, due pondering of a thing. A man is ſaid not to conſider, that ſcanneth not, that examineth not the cauſe, that laies not the effects and conſequences together, that compareth not one thing with another. So that it is thus much now, <hi>they conſidered not;</hi> that is, they pondered not in their hearts, they examined not according to the rule of reaſon; they looked not to it what ſhould be Gods meaning in <hi>taking away merciful men from the evil to come;</hi> they looked not forward to the time to come, nor backward to the time paſt, they were altogether inconſiderate.</p>
               <p>It is a great ſin,
<note place="margin">Inconſideraton a great ſin.</note> and a fruit of ſin, and a cauſe of all ſin. It is a ſin in it ſelfe, for God hath given man Reaſon to uſe upon all occaſions, to conſider Gods works, and his own works, and thoſe things that befal others and himſelf. The true im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement <pb n="103" facs="tcp:47453:58"/>of Chriſtianity is the exerciſe of conſideration. That exciteth a man to repentance. <hi>David</hi> laies it as a ground, <hi>I conſidered my wayes, and turned my feet to thy teſtimonies.</hi> A man never repenteth that conſidereth not his wayes. The want of conſideration keepeth a man freezing, and ſetling on the dregs of ſin.</p>
               <p>It is a fruit of ſin,
<note place="margin">A frui of ſin.</note> of the firſt ſin: incogitancy bringeth ſecurity, that rocks reaſon aſleep; then paſſion hath her ſcope, when reaſon governeth not. It is the trne puniſhment of the firſt ſin, and the fruit of it, becauſe reaſon is decaied in man by ſin, reaſon was then unrectified, reaſon grew irrigular.</p>
               <p>Nay,
<note place="margin">A cauſe of ſin.</note> it is the cauſe of all ſin. We can reſolve no particular ſin to any other principle but this, that men conſider not before they commit it. The reaſon why men go on in exceſs and riot, and continue in drunkenneſs, is nothing but this, <hi>they lay it not heart,</hi> they look not forward, what will be the iſſue and event, they conſider not the account they are to make to God, they think not that God is providing a <hi>cup of deadly wine,</hi> and that <hi>all muſt appear before the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt.</hi> The reaſon why mens deſires of the world, and of living here are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, it is the want of conſideration of what is the heppineſs of heaven, of the promiſes that God hath made. There is no ſin but it is reſolved into this caſe. So here it is, that the Prophet complaineth of the want of conſideration, <hi>When mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful men were taken away, they conſider it not;</hi> to ſympathize, to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to what God would doe after he had removed theſe, that when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the obſtacles, that then he would pour his wrath upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is another extent of the Word; that is, of the ſubject of the perſon.</p>
               <p>No man. It argueth the neglect to be general. A man would have thought, that upon the mention of the firſt word, <hi>Mercyful men are taken away: the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould go about in the ſtreets;</hi> the poor Orphans ſhould weep, becauſe they have loſt a Patron: No ſuch matter, no conſideration on no hand; that is a wonder: had the <hi>merciful man</hi> no wife? no children? no freind to mourn after him, when he was buried in the earth? was there no well-willers to him, that had benefit by his piety to mourn for the <hi>righteous man?</hi> was there none like to himſelf? one <hi>righteous man</hi> will mourn for another. What is this then, <hi>No man?</hi> If they would not regard the piety of the <hi>godly man</hi> or <hi>merciful,</hi> when he lived, me thinks when he died there ſhould be ſome conſideration. A Mountain as long as it ſtandeth, men take no great notice of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>but if it fall, all eyes look upon it. The Sun when he is in his ſtrength, there are few eyes that look on it; but if it come to an ecclipſe, every man gettteh into his Turret.</p>
               <p>Generally men delight to look upon thoſe Stars, that in their opinion they think are fallen. All theſe the godly man is. He ſhineth as a ſtar here, as the Sun in his ſtrength after, he is as a Mountain, as a Beacon upon a Mountain, more glorious. The Mountain, and the ſtar falleth, the Sun is in the Ecclipſe, <hi>Merciful men are taken away, and no man conſidereth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not ſay it is to be taken in the full extent, it implieth not a nullity, but a paucity. As in that place in the Pſalme; <hi>there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> The Prophet doth not imply, that there was not one godly man at all, but ſo few that they could hardly be numbred; a great paucity. So here, <hi>No man conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;</hi> that is thoſe that conſidered, were ſo very few, that there was hardly notice taken of them, they were hardly in the compaſs of a Number.</p>
               <p>Nay, it is twice noted, <hi>No man, no man,</hi> to ſhew it it was almoſt a nullity; there is not any, not any; that is, they were exceeding few.</p>
               <p>What is the reaſon? Becauſe they were not acquainted with the rule, and way of piety, therefore they mourned not. If piety were within, it would ſimpathize without, as there is like rejoycing, ſo they would ſorrow together.</p>
               <p>We are not to think, but they had natural affection, though it were almoſt cut off: It is likely if any of their kin were took away, they would mourne: If a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother were taken away, the moſt impenitent man would have tears; though not for ſin, yet for loſſes and croſſes: then there are thoſe that would crie <pb n="104" facs="tcp:47453:59"/>with <hi>Eliſha, My father my father, the Chariots of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. If a brother or a ſiſter were taken away, I doubt not but there are thoſe that would follow with the voyce of lamentation, <hi>Alas my brother, alas my ſiſter, wo is me for my brother Jonathan.</hi> We have tears for brethren. Further, if it were but a child that were loſt, a man would be ſure to find tears for him, and ſigh along time after, and would ſay with <hi>David; Oh Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon, would God I had died for thee my ſon.</hi> All conditions that live find tears in mens eyes, and conſideration of their departure, only the <hi>godly</hi> and the <hi>righteous man</hi> findeth none.</p>
               <p>Here is their ſtupidity. Can there be a greater ſtupidity, then to make a man die twice? as they die the death of their bodies, ſo to make them ſuffer a death in our memories? as they periſh to the world, ſo to periſh alſo in our thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. We owe God ſo much, we owe piety ſo much, we owe the memorial of many ſo much, we owe our ſelves ſo much, as to take it into conſideration. And yet no man conſidereth.</p>
               <p>This is the fault which we may examine our ſelves of. For if we now make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of all this upon our ſelves, we muſt find a conformity with our times. There is never a word of this Scripture, but it is true now. I will now take the parts in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we cannot deny that evil is to come upon this place.</p>
               <p>Nay, it were well if it were to come: it is come already: it hath overtaken us. If we load, the earth with the evil of ſin, it is impoſſible that God ſhould forbear long. The evil of ſin that ſurchargeth the earth muſt be unloaden again, by this burthen, by the burthen of puniſhment: one burthen muſt juſtle out another. Evils there have been impendant, that we have ſeen. Evils there are now preſent that we begin to groane under: and no man can tell where that evil will ſtay. There is evil preſent, and evils to come, becauſe our evils are ſtill multiplying: the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of ſorrows, and ſufferings, and fears; God grant it may ſtay. But our ſtate and condition is like them in this, that they are yet impendant. We ſee the heavens grown black, judgments are a ripening. When ye ſee the sky red, when ye ſee the skie black, judgment is beginning, not only beginning to bud, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to ſpread and inlarge it ſelfe. Thus farr there is a correſpondency. There is evil that we have cauſe to fear and ſuſpect, yet further to come on this place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a conformity with the other too, in our negligence. The world ſendeth forth men now <hi>void of natural affection.</hi> It was never ſo before. For if before they neglected others, yet they were careful of themſelves. But men now deſperately neglect their own ſalvations. There is no reſpect to God, no pitty of others, no not of themſelves.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder that men heretofore conſidered not, when they loved their lives better then their ſins, becauſe they had ſome ſenſible taſte of that that was temporal, when they loved their lives better then heaven, But now men love not their lives beſt, but their ſins better: for though their lives be in danger, yet their ſins are kept.</p>
               <p>It is an admirable thing to conſider, how every way we are given to plenty, to ryot, to ſecurity, notwithſtanding God cometh neer, and bringeth his judgment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the door, and makes it ſwell. He forbeareth a long time, to trie us with mercies, and then he takes a ſevere courſe. Where ſhall men ſee the face of an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? our lives are the ſame, our delights the ſame, our vanities and follies the ſame; we keep the ſame ſins ſtill, as if we were bent to provoke God further, to ſee what he will do.</p>
               <p>That is an evident ſign we conſider not for what purpoſe God ſendeth his plagues, we conſider not what he doth, when he takes away others for our example; none lay it to heart, and take it into conſideration, it ſwimmeth not in his brain. We begin to tremble, and we think our ſelves well, if we provide a countrey houſe: but God hath beſet us in the Countrey, and in the City. There will be no flight but to repentance, there is the City of refuge: and there is no way to repent but by conſideration: theſe muſt be took to heart before there can be amendment, and till there be amendment, there will he no removing of judgment. It is plain then that we are conform able in that part of the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:47453:59"/>
And in the firſt too. That <hi>merciful men are taken away,</hi> experience ſheweth it daily: they are taken ſo frequently, that there is hardly any left: they are not only <hi>taken away,</hi> but ſwept away. And if there were no other proof, this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, this ſad ſpectacle before our eyes, that is an argument to make the proof of the conformity of the firſt part of the text with us.</p>
               <p>In the text there is mention made of a righteous man, of a merciful man. The Spirit of God bringeth in all the parts by pairs. It is fulfiled in the ſolemnity, and occaſion of this day: by pairs God calleth us to piety, by pairs he giveth us ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of mortality.</p>
               <p>I thought I had come to do the duty for one, to performe the ſolemnity of one Funeral: but after, I perceived I was called to do the office for two. It was not ſo from the beginning, it falleth not out ſo every day. Here is the true proof that theſe are the times of mortality: ſet the pairs any way, and we ſhall ſee that there is one free, none can ſecure himſelf from the ſtroke of death. One, a vertuous ancient Gentlewoman: the other a grave learned miniſter, but of younger condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: here are both ages took away, and both preſented: not only ſo, but here are both conditions of life, and both preſented together; and here are both ſexes, and both preſented together, to teach us, that no ſex, no condition, no age can ſecure themſelves. I will ſmite the Shepheard (ſaith Chriſt, foretelling the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples what ſhould befal them.) Here is the ſmiting of the Shepheard, and the ſheep too: But both together, and I beleeve this place cannot ſend ſuch another pair.</p>
               <p>For the one, He was the moſt eminent for his place; For the other ſhe was the moſt eminent for her piety. I was not acquainted with the converſation of either, and therefore I ſhall not ſpeak much: and the information I had, it was not much, for it was needleſs: I may ſave a labour for both: for if I ſpeak any thing falſe, ye are able to refute me; if I ſpeak any thing true (as all muſt be true that is ſpoken here) yet ye are able to prevent me, and I can ſay nothing that ye know not.</p>
               <p>For the one; I here that he had the report of a man that was conſcionable in the diſcharge of his place. And all that I ſhall ſay of him ſhall be only this; there is cauſe that ye ſhould take to heart his death. For what is the reaſon that in this little Pariſh that is as healthful as another. (But God is wounderful in his wayes, and we muſt not ſearch into the judgments of God) that it is not full eight years, but there have three ſucceeded, that have been commended to this place, and have died one after another? Is it ſo that ye kill them with unkindneſs? the world ſaith ſo I tell ye. I know not, but this I am ſure of, that there have been too many unkind paſſages: where the fault is, your ſelves know. But this is to be taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that God removeth them from ye, as if ye were worthy of none. If God ſend us theſe helps and Lampes that waſte themſelves to ſhine to us, and to break and diſpence to us the bread of life, ſhall we not give them incouragement in their ſtudies, that they may go on quietly and peaceably? A word is enough for that. Howſoever ſome of ye would not ſuffer him to reſt, God hath taken him to his reſt. There is more might be ſaid, but I will not ſay too much.</p>
               <p>For the other, ſince I came from my houſe, I had information at my firſt foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Pariſh, they ſaid ſhe was as good a woman as lived. At my firſt footing in the houſe, they ſaid ſhe was a very good woman. Thoſe that have lived in the Pariſh, they teſtifie, that ſhe was a woman moſt eminent for her piety and vertue. Shall ſhe want a memorial? I asked of thoſe that have known her of old, they ſay, ſhe was a righteous woman, for the righteouſneſs of piety, and a merciful woman for the righteonſneſs of mercy. She had reſpect to both tables, to her duty to God, to her Neighbour. For the mercy of charity, ſhe was good to the poor: ſhe was a lender to thoſe that were in neceſſity, and a giver too. For the mercy of piety ſhe was very compaſſionate to thoſe that were in afflictions, ſhe ſympathized with them, viſited them and comforted them. For the mercy of peace, in time of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, ſhe laboured to ſet all ſtrait, ſhe had a ſoft anſwer co pacifie wrath. She was a merciful woman, and God hath given her the reward, hath took her to his reſt. She was a lover of peace, he hath taken her to the place of peace. She was one hat ſtudied happineſs, and he hath taken her to a place of happineſs. He hath <pb n="106" facs="tcp:47453:60"/>took her from theſe evils that we are reſerved to, and that we may fear.</p>
               <p>That is the difference between a godly and an impenitent man. Impenitent men, if they be took away, they are taken to further evill, if they be left alive, they are left to further evil. Merciful men, if they be took away, they are taken away for the eſchewing of evil: and if they be left on the earth, it is for the diverting of evil. They divert them while they live, and ſhun them when they die. As they labour to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God in their lives, ſo God gratifieth them in their death, he takes them to himſelf.</p>
               <p>This conſideration, and occaſion, is a proof of the Text. As it is proved in all the Text, let us diſprove it in our ſelves, that this word may never go in the courſe it lieth here, but in a contrary courſe. That righteous men periſh, and men do lay it to heart, (let it be ſaid ſo) and merciful men, though they be took away, yet there are thoſe that take it into conſideration. I have done with the laſt part, and with the occaſion.</p>

               <p>That that is <hi>written</hi> is for the more aſſurance. <hi>It ſeemeth good to me</hi> (faith Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in his preface to his Goſpel) <hi>Moſt excellent Theophilus, to write to thee of theſe things in order, that thou mighteſt know the certainty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>And although, the whole will of God, <hi>all things neceſſary to ſolvation be written,</hi> yet God did appoint ſome ſpecial things above all others to be <hi>written,</hi> ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of divide truths.

               </p>
               <p>We are to thank God (I ſay) for the whole Scripture,
<note place="margin">Rom.14.1.</note> for every part of it: <hi>for whatſoever is written, is written for our learning that we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the which you have five things;</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">The diviſion of the words.</note> you have a <hi>Propoſition. Dead men are bleſſed, Bleſſed are the dead.</hi> Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is not generally true, therefore.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, you have the <hi>Particulars wherein this bleſſedneſs conſiſts.</hi> It is in a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of their labours;</hi> and <hi>a Retribution of their works, they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, you have a <hi>Confirmation</hi> of all this. It is confirmed firſt, by <hi>a voyce from heaven; A voyce from heaven ſaid write.</hi> And then it is confirmed by te Spirit of God; <hi>Even ſo ſaith the ſpirit, they reſt from their labours.</hi>

               <p>I begin with the firſt.<lb/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> is a thing that every man deſireth. He is no man, but a monſter, that would live wretchedly. Every man deſireth to be <hi>bleſſed.</hi>

               <p>To let them paſſe. <hi>Bleſſedneſs conſiſteth in the enjoying of the ſoveraign good. That ſame ſoveraign good is God.</hi> We enjoy God both in this life, and in the life to come.</p>
               <note place="margin">A double bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.</note>
               <p>From hence there is a double <hi>Bleſſedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Diſtinguiſh them as you will; Whether you call one <hi>Beatudo vioe,</hi> the other <hi>Beatudo patrioe,</hi> as ſome do.

There is none have the <hi>Bleſſedneſs of Glory,</hi> but ſuch as were firſt <hi>Bleſſed in the ſtate of Grace.</hi> And there is none <hi>Bleſſed in a ſtate of Grace,</hi> but ſhall be <hi>Bleſſed in the ſtate of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a threefold condition of a <hi>Bleſſed ſoul.</hi> It is here <hi>in the body,</hi> (as long as God pleaſeth) But then <hi>it is from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is <hi>with the Lord,</hi> but then it is <hi>from the Body.</hi> There is a third Condition, when it ſhall be <hi>in the body</hi> again,
<note place="margin">Phil, 3.21.</note> and <hi>with the Lord for ever.</hi> Then is the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumation of bliſſe, when this ſame body of ours ſhall be raiſed up, <hi>and made like the glorious body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> in this life, though we have here a comfortable fellowſhip with God, yet, becauſe that it is not <hi>per ſpeciem,</hi> it is not by ſight, it is but by faith, <hi>we walk by faith and not by ſight.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.

               </p>
               <p>Therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1 23.</note> 
                  <hi>and to be with Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> (quoth he) it is <hi>melius, it is better: Better?</hi> Yea, it is <hi>multo melius, it is much better:</hi> Yea, it is <hi>multo mag is melius</hi> (you muſt bear with Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity of ſpeech) <hi>it is much more better to be with him.

               </p>
               <p>But the hope of our immortal life, is the life of this mortal.</p>
               <p>There was ſome little glimpſe of this light, even amongſt the Gentiles, (ſuch as did beleeve the immortality of the ſoul.) One of the heathen Poets could ſay, <hi>No man is bleſſed till death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Creſſus</hi> the Lybian (a man happy in his great achievements) asked <hi>Solon; Pray</hi> (quoth he) <hi>tell me, what man doſt thou think happy?</hi> He named one to him, (<hi>Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>) a man that was dead. <hi>But</hi> (quoth he) <hi>whom elſe doſt thou think haypy?</hi> He named two btethren more, that did a worke of piety to their Mother (it were too long to tell you the particular ſtory) and they were dead, <hi>I think them happy,</hi> quoth he. <hi>Creſſus</hi> began to be angry, that he himſelf ſhould not be thought a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man. Am not I happy? <hi>Oh</hi> (quoth he) <hi>I take thee for a great King, but I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cont thee not happy before death. Creſſus</hi> grew to miſery, and then he cried out, <hi>Oh Solon, Solon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here we have a word, <hi>a voyce from heaven:</hi> and the Word confirmed by the Spirit: and we have teſtimonies of Scripture: and we have ſome little glimpſe of this light from the Gentiles: yet notwithſtanding, fleſh and bloud will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of this, <hi>that dead men ſhould be happy,</hi> that there is a happineſſe in <hi>death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many things they have againſt it. Firſt, ſay they, <hi>Death is an enemy.</hi> It is very true, <hi>Death is is an enemy,</hi> the Apoſtle calleth it ſo. <hi>The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:47453:62"/>And, ſay they, <hi>it is a terrible enemy.</hi> It is very true, and <hi>of all terrible things the moſt terrible:</hi> yea, and nature abhorreth it exceedingly.

                  <hi>Somnium Scipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis. Scipio</hi> asked his Father, when his father had told him of thoſe glories that the ſoul enjoyed in immortality: <hi>Why</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>do I tarry thus long upon the earth? why do not I haſten to die?</hi> The ſchollers of <hi>Eugeſius,</hi> when they heard their Maſter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the immortality of the ſoul, went and laid violent hands upon themſelves, that they might go to that immortality. And ſo <hi>Cato Uticenſis</hi> after he read <hi>Platoes</hi> books of the Immortality of the Soul; made away himſelf. Many ſuch examples there have been. And I find often-times in your bills many that have laid violent hands upon themſelves, ſome that cut their own throats, and ſome that hang themſelves. I pray give me leave a little to ſpeak upon this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:47453:62"/>Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells me of five cauſes, for which perſons do uſually lay violent hands upon themſelves.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this.
<note place="margin">Five cauſes of ſelf-murther.</note> Some do it to avoid ſome ſhame, or ſome diſhonour, or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or beggery, that ſhall befall them. Thus did <hi>Achitophel,</hi> when he ſaw that his counſell was defeated, he went home and hanged himſelf: Thus have many done to avoid ſhame and diſhonour. Alas poor wretches; While they ſeek to eſcape temporal puniſhment, they run into eternal, like our fiſhes in the proverb, <hi>out of the frying-pan into the fire: into hell fire, where the worm dieth not, and where the fire never goeth out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſome have done it to avoid the terrors of a guilty conſcience. Thus <hi>Judas,</hi> troubled in conſcience, after he had betrayed Chriſt, he went and hung him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Poor wretch; He had more need he had lived, that he might have healed that ſin of his by repentance. This is not a way to expiate thy ſin, this is a way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it. <hi>Judas</hi> when he killed himſelf, he killed as wicked a man as was upon the earth, and yet he ſhall anſwer to God, aſwell for that nocent bloud of his own that he ſpilt, as he ſhall for the innocent bloud of the Son of God that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we find ſome that have done this to avoid ſome villany that they feared ſhould be offered them. As for example. <hi>Pelagia</hi> a noble Lady, that we read of in Eccleſiaſtcall ſtories, when ſhe was followed by ſome barbarous ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that would have abuſed her, ſhe ſpeaking nothing but, <hi>never a villain of them all ſhall touch me;</hi> threw her ſelf over a bridge, and drowned her ſelf.</p>
               <p>Some of the Fathers do little leſſe then commend her for this. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> condemnes her, ſo ſhould I. For, why ſhould ſhe that had done no hurt, do hurt to her ſelf? why ſhould ſhe to eſcape the hands of the Nocent, lay violent hands upon her ſelf that was innocent? Our chaſtity of body is not loſt, when the chaſtity of our mind remaineth inviolated.</p>
               <p>Fourthly; Some have done this to purchaſe to themſelves a name of valour. <hi>Raſis</hi> in the book of the Machabees did thus. And if there were no other thing in the world to ſhew that book to be Apochriphal Scripture, this is enough, in that the Author of that book commendeth <hi>Raſis</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>It is not valour for to flie a danger: it is valour to bear it. If any example can be alledged to this purpoſe, that of <hi>Sampſons</hi> may. But Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> he anſwereth. The Spirit of God ſecretly commandeth him to do it. And we may verily beleeve it: for if the Spirit of God had not commanded it, yea, and aſſiſted him in it too, he had never done that he did, in pulling down the houſe upon himſelf and the Philiſtims.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſome have done it, or they might have done it, becauſe <hi>Bleſſed are the dead.</hi> Some will die, that they may be bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Poor wretches; They that diprive themſelves of this life, may not look for a better when this is ended. I will not judge particulars, I leave them unto God. But in the general, Conſidering that life is Gods bleſſing: it is he that giveth it, and it is he that muſt take it away. Conſidering that man is not lord of his own ſpirit. Conſidering that God hath ſet us here in our ſtations, and we may not move out without leave from our General. Conſidering that we are ſet here to ſerve God, and we muſt ſerve him as long as he will, and not as long as we will. Or ſpecially conſidering that God hath forbidden us to kill others, therefore forbidden us much more to kill our ſelves: therefore ſurely (except Gods mercy be greater then I can give warrant for) they that die thus, die eternally. And we had need beſeech God with all earneſtneſs of ſpirit, to keep us from ſuch a fearful temptation as this: for they that die thus, <hi>die not in the Lord,</hi> and therefore cannot be <hi>bleſſed:</hi> for my Text ſaith it of no other, but of thoſe, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead, that die in the Lord.</hi> This is the firſt point.</p>
               <p>I come to the Reſtriction.

                     </gap>ie in the Lord Rom. 16.1.</note> the prepoſition is Ambiguous: for the prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition many times in Scripture ſignifies <hi>In Domino,</hi> or <hi>propter Dominum.</hi> As <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.1. <hi>I commend unto you Phebe our ſiſter, that you would receive her, in Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, in the Lord;</hi> that is for the Lords ſake, <hi>as becometh Saints.</hi> And in the twelfth verſe of the ſame Chapter, <hi>Salute the beloved Perſis which laboured much in the Lord;</hi> that is, <hi>laboured much in Gods cauſe, for the Lord.</hi> So again, <hi>Say to Archippus, look to the miniſtery that thou haſt received, In Domino;</hi> that is, <hi>for the Lord,</hi> for the Lords ſervice, for his work. I might give you many more inſtances. There is one place moſt pregnant, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. <hi>I Paul a priſoner, in Domino;</hi> ſo ſaith the vulgar Latine, and ſo is the Greek interpretation, <hi>In the Lord.</hi> What meaneth Saint <hi>Paul? A priſoner in the Lord,</hi> what is that? <hi>A priſoner for the Lord, a priſoner for the Lords cauſe.</hi> And thus you may take the word here in the Text—<hi>Bleſſed are they that die, in Domino;</hi> that is, ſuch as <hi>die in cauſa Domini:</hi> and thus <hi>Judicious Beza,</hi> (to whoſe judgment I attribute much in tranſlations) he read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſo, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead, qui moriuutur cauſa Domini:</hi> and then in his Annotations, <hi>propter Dominum.</hi> And if you take it thus, then the Martyrs only are bleſſed. That Martyrs are bleſſed, the Church of God is ſo far from making a queſtion, that they ſet it down as a Rule. <hi>Injuriam facit Martyri qui orat pro Martyre; A man doth wrong to a Martyr, that prayes for a Martyr,</hi> their bleſſedneſs is ſo ſure: for, <hi>He that loſeth his life for my ſake, and the Goſpels, ſhall find it,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. If he loſeth a temporal life, he ſhall find an eternal. If he loſe a life accompanied with ſorrow, he ſhall find another life that is with joy, ſuch joy as cannot be conceived, ſuch joy as ſhall never be ended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two things (ſaith S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) that makes the <hi>death of a Saint precious;</hi> the one is a good life before; the other is a good cauſe for which he dieth. A good life will make it <hi>a precious death:</hi> but a good cauſe will make it a more <hi>precious death.</hi> But that is the moſt <hi>pretious death,</hi> that hath both a good life before it, and a good cauſe coming next.</p>
               <p>The Matyrs are bleſſed, but they muſt be ſuch Martyrs as ſuffer for the Lord, be ſure of that, or elſe they are not bleſſed. There be ſome that would be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Martyrs (a great company of ſuch we have had of late) that have died for broaching of reaſon, and ſome for ſowing of ſedition; ſome for abſolving ſubjects from the oath of Alleageance, ſome for attempting to blow up Parliament houſes. Such as theſe are not Martyrs. <hi>It is not the puniſhment, it is the cauſe that makes the Martyr.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord himſelfe, that never did evil, was crucified between two evil-doers; there was an equal puniſhment, there was not an equal cauſe. It muſt be the cauſe that we muſt look to, if we look to be bleſſed.</p>
               <p>But I cantot ſtand upon that. Here is the firſt interpretation: <hi>To die in the Lord, is for the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is a ſecond, and that is more large, <hi>die in the Lord,</hi> that is, die in the faith of the Lord. <hi>Salute Andronicus, and Junius my fellow priſoners, which were in the Lord before me,</hi> Saith S. <hi>Paul;</hi> that is, that were Beleevers, that were in the faith before me.</p>
               <p>And (to let paſs many other places) <hi>if there be no reſurrection of the dead</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>then we that are aſleep in Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4.</note> &amp;c. <hi>If we beleeve that Jeſus died, then thoſe that ſleep in Jeſus ſhall he bring with him,</hi> &amp;c. and Again, <hi>He ſhall deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from heaven with a ſhout, and they that are dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.</hi> Now what is it to die in Chriſt in a large ſenſe?</p>
               <p>I will tell you. He that would die in Chriſt, firſt he muſt <hi>die in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many works of obedience,
<note place="margin">1. To die in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</note> that we are to doe.</p>
               <p>Our laſt and greateſt act of obedience, is to reſign up this ſame ſpirit of ours willingly, chearfully into the hands of God that gave it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:47453:63"/>If we have not attained to that ſtrength, that ſome have done; that is, to live patiently, and die willingly, yet we ſhould labour to attain to thus much ſtrength to live willingly, and to die patiently; <hi>So as Chriſt may be magnified in my body</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I paſs not,</hi> it makes no matter, <hi>let it either be by life, or by death.</hi>
               </p>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note>
               <p>When we have done the work that God hath ſet us to do, we muſt be gone: and thus muſt every one ſay with himſelf; <hi>Lord if I have done all the work thou haſt appointed me to do, call me away at thy pleaſure.</hi> Here is the firſt. In obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Secondly.
<note place="margin">2. In repentance</note> 
                  <hi>Die in repentance.</hi> I remember what <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> ſaid of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> a little before his death, that it was neceſſary that men when they died, they ſhould not go out of the world, <hi>abſque digna &amp; competenti reſipiſcentiâ, without a fit competent repentance.</hi> He himſelfe did ſo, for he cauſed the peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Plalmes to be written, and they were before him, as he lay upon his bed, and he was continually reading thoſe penitential Pſalmes, and meditating upon them with many tears: he died even in the very act of contrition.</p>
               <p>I do love to ſee a man chearful upon his death-bed: but I do more love to ſee a man penitent. There is a day indeed, <hi>when God will wipe away all tears from our eyes;</hi> When that cometh, then he will wipe away theſe tears of repentance too, theſe tears of godly ſorrow: <hi>But the Lord grant he may find me with tears in mine eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly;
<note place="margin">3. In faith.</note> 
                  <hi>Die in faith.</hi> Indeed if ever Faith had a work to doe, it bath then a work to do, when all other comforts in the world fail us, and freinds go from us; then faith, to lay hold on the promiſes; <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that I ſhall riſe again at the laſt day, and be covered with my skin, and ſhall ſee God with theſe ſame eyes.</hi> Thus faith.</p>
               <p>And then fourthly.
<note place="margin">4. With prayer.</note> 
                  <hi>Die with Invocation,</hi> calling upon the name of God. Thus have all the Saints of God done, continually commending of their ſouls to God in prayers. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would have us <hi>commend our ſouls to God in well-doing.</hi> And it is a neceſary thing every morning we riſe, and every night we go to bed, but eſpecially when we ſee ſome harbingers of death ſent unto us, then to have nothing to do,
<note place="margin">Luke 23.46. Act. 7.59.</note> but with our bleſſed Lord; <hi>Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit.</hi> And with Saint <hi>Steven, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And next to this,
<note place="margin">5. In charity.</note> let me put in alſo, <hi>Mercy, Charity:</hi> Die <hi>forgiving one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> Thus our Lord taught us to do, when he cried out, <hi>Father forgive them for they know not what they do.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 23.34. Act. 7.60.</note> And Saint <hi>Steven</hi> taught us to do ſo too; <hi>Lord lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then laſtly, (for I cannot ſtand upon theſe things) there muſt be a <hi>death in Peace.</hi> Peace with God: Peace with our own conſciences, and Peace with all the world.</p>
               <p>And now the man that dieth thus;
<note place="margin">6. In peace.</note> dieth with <hi>willingneſs:</hi> dieth in <hi>repentance,</hi> dieth in <hi>faith,</hi> dieth with <hi>invocation,</hi> dieth in <hi>charity,</hi> dieth in <hi>peace,</hi> this man <hi>dieth in the Lord,</hi> and ſuch a one is bleſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that would thus die in him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How to come to die in the Lord.</note> 
                  <hi>muſt live in him.</hi> A man cannot be ſaid to die in <hi>London</hi> that never lived in <hi>London.</hi> A man cannot be ſaid to <hi>die in the Lord,</hi> that never lived in the Lord. If thou doſt not live in <hi>obedience,</hi> in <hi>faith,</hi> in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentence,</hi> in <hi>invocation,</hi> in <hi>charity, in peace,</hi> thou canſt not die in theſe. A man muſt firſt live the life of the righteous, before he can <hi>die the death of the righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then again, if a man would die thus, <hi>He muſt be well acquainted with death:</hi> grow familiar with him by meditation. Many things more I might have ſaid to this purpoſe, but I am loath to tranſgreſs the hour. I have done with that.</p>
               <p>Give me only leave now to ſpeak in a few words unto the preſent occaſion.</p>
               <p>You have brought here (beloved) the body of your well-beloved neighbour, Miſtris <hi>S.H.</hi> late the Wife of your late reverent Paſtour, Doctor, <hi>R.H.</hi> to be laid up together with her Husband, in hope of a bleſſed and glorious reſurrection. It is long ſince that I did in this Place perform this ſervice at the buriall of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wife, a woman of whom I may not ſpeak, for though I hold my peace, the <pb n="114" facs="tcp:47453:64"/>very ſtone here in the wall will ſay enough of her: and you that know her, cannot but aſſure the truth of it.</p>
               <p>I am intreated to perform now, the like duty to the ſecond Wiſe. And I was eaſily intreated to do it: for that name of brother and ſiſter, that was uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us for many years continued, may very well challenge of me, any duty I am able to perform. I am ſtraitned in time, and I cannot ſpeak what I would: and I do perceive already by this that I have ſpoken, that if I ſhould ſpeak much more, my paſſion would not give me leave. Let me tell you one thing amongſt many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it is a thing extraordinary, and it is for imitation. The <hi>Vertuous woman</hi> in the laſt of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> is commended for many things; Amongſt others this is one, <hi>She doth her husband good, and not evil, all the dayes of her life.</hi> And mark it I pray you: <hi>It is not all the dayes of his life,</hi> and yet peradventure ſome woman might be thought a good woman, that doth that, but ſhe may perhaps outlive her Husband. <hi>A vertuoks woman will do him good, and not evil all the dayes of her life:</hi> And for this amongſt many other things, I do commend this vertuous Gentlewoman. I may almoſt ſay with the words there in the end of that Chapter; <hi>Many daughters have done excollently, but thou ſurmounteſt them all.</hi> So I may ſay, many women peradventure have done excellently in this kind; but I do not know of any one that ever hath done the like to her Husband. I pray you hear it.</p>
               <p>Her Husband had a brother that lived in <hi>Portugal,</hi> at the time of his death, who was there married, he had there three children at leaſt, two ſons and a daughter. This vertuous good Woman would give her ſelf no reſt, till ſhe had theſe children out of <hi>Portugal:</hi> ſhe got the two ſons hither. And what was her care? (here is another exceſlency of hers) her chief care was for their ſouls. What did ſhe? or rather what did ſhe not to win thoſe children from Popery (in which they have been brought up) and to bring them to the true ſervice of God? She obtained it, ſhe got it.</p>
               <p>When ſhe had done that, won them to our religion, ſhe had not done all: one of theſe had a deſire to exerciſe ſome Merchandiſe by Sea. She furniſhed him to the Sea, ſhe furnſhed him with money for his adventures. The other ſhe bound Apprentiſe here in the City to an honeſt trade: and ſhe hath given them a liberall childes portion, I may ſay ſo. A childs portion, that they may thank God (and I hope they will have the grace to do it) that they had, I do not ſay ſuch a Aunt in law, but ſuch a Mother.</p>
               <p>Here was not all. She ſent for the Mother too; ſhe was but ſiſter-in-law to her Husband: ſhe ſent for the mother, ſhe ſent for the Daughter: they were here. She clothed them; ſhe fed them ſome moneths: and if ſhe could have won them to our religion, ſhe would have maintained the Mother while ſhe had lived: ſhe would have brought up the Daughter, as her own child: But that could not be done, it was a work beyond her ſtrength.</p>
               <p>You ſee here a vertuous Woman, that did good to her Husband, not all the dayes of his life, but all the dayes of her life: To the very laſt day of her life, ſhe never did ceaſe to do good to her Husband in his kindred: and I think I may ſay, that ſhe was more careful of his kindred, then of her own. But this is not all. This kindneſs you will ſay was ſhewed to her Husbands kindred. Hear a little more therefore.</p>
               <p>She knew that there were many Miniſters that had a great charge of children, and peradventure would be very glad to have ſome of their children taken off of their hands. She hath given to the putting out of five Miniſters children, to bind them Apprentices, fifty pounds.</p>
               <p>She knew that there were ſome poor perſons of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> here, which ſtood in neceſſity; She hath given to the relieſe of them, twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>She knew that there were many poor ſouls, that lay in Turkiſh ſlavery. She hath given for the redeeming of them, twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Nay, yet more; She conſidered, that her Husband was ſometime a poor ſcholler in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> And ſhe conſidered too, that, there are many Miniſters Widowes that lived well, while their husband lived, that are fain to crave <pb n="115" facs="tcp:47453:64"/>reliefe (the greater is the ſhame of ſome men) when they are dead. She hath therefore given five hundred pounds to purchaſe lands, and with this land to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, partly two Schollers in the Univerſity, from their firſt coming thither, till they be Maſters of Art. And then with the reſidue to maintaine four Widows, that have been the Wives of honeſt preaching Miniſters. <hi>Zacheus,</hi> his offer was, but half of his goods. <hi>Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor.</hi> For ought I can perceive and underſtand, above half of her eſtate ſhe hath given to charitable uſes. I ſay no more of her. <hi>Theſe works of her will praiſe her in the gates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She died in the Country. And I am ſorry that I had not information (as I did deſire) of her behaviour in her ſickneſs. I have it not: I can ſay nothing of it: but thus much. It was not poſſible, that ſuch a creature, that lived thus (as we know ſhe did) in <hi>obedience</hi> to God, in <hi>repentance,</hi> in <hi>faith,</hi> with <hi>invocation</hi> of Gods mercy, in <hi>Charity,</hi> in <hi>Peace,</hi> but that her death was bleſſed. She that lived in the Lord, no queſtion but ſhe died in the Lord, and ſhe is bleſſed; for <hi>Bleſſed are the dead, that die in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Good Lord teach us to number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts to wiſdom;</hi> and grant that as we grow in years, we may grow in knowledge of thy truth, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to thy will, in faith in thy promiſes, in love toward thee, and toward our neighbours for thy ſake, that when we come to the end of our dayes, we may come to <hi>the end of our hope, the ſalvation of our ſouls,</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt: to whom with thee oh Father, and thee oh holy Spirit, three Perſons, but one true and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and only wiſe God, be given, both from us, and all thy creatures in heaven and in earth, continual praiſe, honour, glory, dominion and power, now and for evermore.</p>
               <p>Let all thoſe that hear the word of God depart from iniquity. <hi>Now the God of Peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, the great Shepheard of the ſheep, through the bloud of the everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect to do his will, working in you that which is pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt; Amen.</hi>

He ſheweth that they did not with the neglect of the knowledge of any truth keep themſelves ignorant in this particular: but it was their weakneſs. The ſtrong ſhould bear with the weak, and the weak ſhould not cenſure the ſtrong: the reaſon is, becauſe they agree in one end: they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound one general end to themſelves, that guides them in all their actions, they walk in one way, and in one path, and therefore they ſhould in theſe things agree together. The general end at which they all aymed in their doings is <hi>the Lord: He that eateth</hi> (faith he) <hi>eateth to the Lord, &amp; he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not;</hi> that is, ſtill he propoundeth God as his end, and the <pb n="118" facs="tcp:47453:66"/>pleaſing of God in his actions, as the rule of them. That he may prove this unto us, that they ſtand thus affected, both of them, notwithſtanding this difference, he bringeth in this as the general reaſon, where to every particular of their lives may be reduced: All their life is ordered by the Lord: <hi>they live to the Lord, they die to the Lord, ſo that whet her they live or die, they are the Lords;</hi> Therefore all their particular actions are to the Lord. <hi>Whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we die, we die to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this general reaſon he propoundeth two wayes.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diviſion.</hi>
                  </note> Firſt, Negatively, <hi>None of us living to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly Affirmatively: which conſiſteth of two parts. Their duty to God. Gods acceptance of them, and protection over them.</p>
               <p>Their duty to God, <hi>if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gods acceptance of them; <hi>Whether we live or die we are the Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which we ſhall now inſiſt upon, is the former part, the negative expreſſion and propoſal of this general reaſon; <hi>none of us liveth to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Explinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> None of us</note> when the A poſtle affirmeth this of the beleevers of thoſe times, he therein intimateth thus much; that it is the courſe of beleevers in all times; It is a duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to all others; of which they muſt make account, not to live to themſelves, but to the Lord. Therefore though he ſpeaks generally here, yet there is in his ſpeech a kind of particular univerſality: a generality with a reſtraint. He ſaith <hi>none of us:</hi> he ſaith not none in the world <hi>live to themſelves,</hi> for there are many in the world <hi>live to themſelves, and not to the Lord:</hi> but <hi>none of us:</hi> none of thoſe that we rank our ſelves with, that are in the condition of beleevers: none of thoſe concerning whom we ſpeak in this queſtion: <hi>none of us live to our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Life in general,
<note place="margin">liveth</note> is nothing elſe but that power whereby we act or move. As we read, <hi>Gen. 2. God breathed into man the breath of life, and he became a living ſoul:</hi> he gave him the power whereby he acted. The acting of this power is the exerciſe of that life, whether the action be of the mind, or of the body. And ſo, as there is a donble life, there are two ſorts of actions of life: there are natural actions of a natural life, and there are ſpiritual actions of a ſpiritual life. When the Apoſtle ſpeaks of living, he intends both theſe. <hi>We live not;</hi> that is, we do not the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, whether natural or ſpiritual, <hi>to our ſelves, but to the Lord. No man liveth to himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>himſelf,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">to himſelf.</note> he meaneth not only a mans perſon, either ſoul or body: but all thoſe advantages, that conduce, to the well-being of a man. No man of us ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the actions of his life, with reference and reſpect to our ſelves, as the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt end: we do not make our own well-being, or well-fare, the uttermoſt end of our actions: <hi>none of us live to our ſelves:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have the ſenſe and meaning of the words; which being a patterne to other Chriſtians: a thing which the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth, is or ſhould be in every beleever, it giveth us this point of inſtruction, whereupon we ſhall inſiſt at this time. That is,<lb/>
                  <hi>No Beleever,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſervat.</hi>
                     </note> none that are in Chriſt, ſhould make themſelves the end in their actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None ſhould live;
<note place="margin">A beleever is not to make himſelf the end in his actions <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </note> that is, ſpend their time and ſtrength and endeavour, ayming at no higher end then themſelves. No Chriſtian ſhould ſo ſpend his time, as to ſeek himſelf only in the actions that he doth; <hi>None of us liveth to himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it may be objected (for the clearing of the point) May not a Chriſtian ſeek himſelf, in the things that he doth? When they do good things, that which God commandeth, that they may avoid the puniſhment: when, being incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the promiſe of a reward, they performe the actions of obedience, do they not herein ſeek themſelves? they ſeek the avoyding of evil to themſelues, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of good for themſelves: and doing thus they live to themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:47453:66"/>To this we Anſwer.
<note place="margin">

               <p>Firſt in ſubordination to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in competition with him, or oppoſiton againſt him.</p>
               <p>Conſider a mans ſelf in ſubordination to God: ſo a man may ſeek himſelf; that is,
<note place="margin">How a man may ſeek him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> he may ſeek his own good: though not as the uttermoſt end, wherein his thoughts reſt, yet he hath this incouragement. <hi>Self-love is a plant of Gods own planting</hi> in the heart of man: and he will not have any man root out that that he hath planted:
<note place="margin">Selfe-love lawful.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace drieth not up the fountain of nature:</hi> It doth but turn the ſtream into a new channel: it guides it the right way. When a man is renewed by grace, and ſanctified, he is the ſame man in his faculties: he doth his actions better then he did before; and all that he did before, he doth them to a better end. It is impoſſible that the will of man ſhould incline to any thing, but as he conceiveth it good, and good for me: now there is no man can conceive a thing as good for him, but he muſt conceive it as good and ſutable to him, ſutable to his welfare and condition. The law of God forbiddeth not this, but eſtabliſheth it, and commendeth it, if it be rightly ordered. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength, that is the cheif:</hi> notwithſtanding thou ſhalt not hate thy ſelf: <hi>thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> ſubordinate to the love of a mans ſelf muſt be the love of his neighbour; and ſubordinate to his love of God, muſt be the love of himſelf. Thou maiſt love thy ſelf, but in a degree inferiour to God. Thou muſt love thy ſelf in God, and ſeek thy good in God, and not in thy ſelf: therefore it is that God in the Scripture hath ſet promiſes and threatnings one oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the other. Now it is lawful for a man to be drawn to obedience, or driven from ſin by any argument that God uſeth in his Word. When God threatneth puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall not men be awakened? the Lyon roareth, and the beaſts of the Forreſt tremble. When God promiſeth: here is the act of faith to receive this promiſe, and to believe it.</p>
               <p>Herein <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Author and finiſher of our faith,</hi> is ſet as a patterm for us, <hi>he ſet before him the joy.</hi> It is lawful for a Chriſtian herein to imitate Chriſt: I ſpeak this for their ſakes, to allure them by incouragements from the Word: that howſoever the avoyding of ſin by threatnings is an action of ſelf-love, without the love of God; yet theſe two may ſtand together in a due ſubordination one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a mans love to himſelf, and love to God: to love God more then himſelf, and ſo to ſeek all good in God, and in the way leading to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, take man as he ſtandeth in competition, and oppoſite to God, in matter of will and deſire. In this caſe a man muſt not love and ſeek himſelf, but God. When a man ſeeks good to himſelf in a way diſpleaſing to God, herein he muſt not ſeek himſelf; for he muſt live to God, and not to himſelf: when his thoughts and deſires, and affections, are carried for himſelf principally; this is againſt the rule: this is not the ſtate of a Chriſtian, of a beleever, thus to ſeek himſelf in any thing contrary to God, or in any thing above him.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the opening of it. And it ſhall appear to be a truth by theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>For a man <hi>to live to himſelf:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proved by reaſon.</note> that is, to do the actions of life with reſpect to himſelf, not to others, and to God. It is</p>
               <p>Firſt a diſhonour to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly injurious to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, dangerous and hurtful to a mans ſelf.</p>
               <p>Eirſt (I ſay) it is diſhonourable to God.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. It is diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to God.</note> It is the greateſt diſhonour the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can do to the Creatour, to exalt himſelf, to make himſelf his end in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he doth. It is to make a mans ſelf a God, and to make God an Idol. For what is that incommunicable <hi>glory that God will not give to another,</hi> but this, to make himſelf his end? It is a glory proper only to God. <hi>He made all things for himſelf, Prov.</hi> 16.4. Mark how theſe two agree well together, that that, that is the efficient cauſe, ſhould be the final cauſe too: that as God is the maker, ſo he ſhould be the end of all things: and as that that giveth Being to the creature it is our of it ſelf, ſo likewiſe that, that ſhould quicken and act the creature ſhould be out of <pb n="120" facs="tcp:47453:67"/>it ſelf. When a man therefore propounds himſelf as his end, he is ſaid in that to make himſelf God. Thoſe falſe Apoſtles, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. it is ſaid of them, that <hi>they made their belly their God;</hi> becauſe this they propounded as their end, how they might advantage themſelves in the world, how they might feed and delight themſelves, and exalt themſelves, and ſerve not God. This is to bring God below a mans ſelf, making God an Idol, and himſelf God. I ſay therefore it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſhonour that the creature can do to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. It is injurious. to Chriſt, Phil. ver. 19.</note> it is the greateſt injury that he can do to Chriſt, to live to himſelf. Chriſt may ſay truly, and more properly, and fitly to us, then Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could, ſay to <hi>Philemon, thou oweſt thy ſelf to me.</hi> We owe our ſelves to him by all rights eſpecially by that great right ofpurchaſe: he bought us to himſelf, he redeemed us to himſelf;
<note place="margin">1. Cor 6.20.</note> 
                  <hi>You are bought with a price,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>therefore glorifie God in your ſpirits and bodies, for they are Gods.</hi> They are his, and not your own, becauſe he bought them, bought them when you were ſlaves, and had inthralled your ſelves, therefore you owe your ſelves to him, he hath purchaſed you to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>In the old Law, the rule was, that if a man had bought another, either out of captivity, or the like, he was to demand all the work and ſervice, that this man could doe, all his time and ſtrength belonged unto hm that bought him, for he was his money, therefore he might exact of him the uttermoſt he could do for his ſervice, for he bought him. Much more Chriſt, that hath bought us from a worſe ſlavery, from a ſlavery under the power of darkneſs: and bought us with the greateſt price, even with the effuſion of his own bloud:
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath redeemed us</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Peter) not with ſilver and gold, but with his own precious bloud;</hi> a price far above that, if a man ſhould give all his wealth. Now when Chriſt hath bought us for himſelf, we are become not his money, but his bloud; therefore all that we have, and are, is due to him, becauſe we are his. If we have any good in the world, in things preſent: if there be any good to the ſoul, in things to come, all is by Chriſt, therefore all muſt be unto him.</p>
               <p>If a man have a ſervant, if he be either bound to him, ſuppoſe an Apprentiſe: or if he be hired to him, ſuppoſe a workman or Artificer: if he live by him, and have maintenance from him: every man expects that his time be to his Maſter, and his work for his Maſters advantage. If a day-labourer come at night and demand pay: the Maſter will ask him, what work he did? ſuppoſe the man ſhould tell him, he had been building himſelf a cottage, or mending his own apparel, or had been doing ſuch and ſuch work for himſelf: but what haſt thou done for me, ſaith the Maſter? Doſt thou think to live by me, and not work to me? Do we think to live by Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Luk. 1.74.</note> and not ſerve Chriſt? This is the very end why <hi>he hath delivered us from the hands of our enemies, that we might ſerve him in holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all the dayes of our life:</hi> Mark it: we muſt ſerve him, for he hath delivered us; that is, we muſt do him ſervice: do his work, not ſome peece of the day, and the work of another, another part of the day: do ſomewhat with reſpect to God, and ſomewhat with reſpect to our ſelves: but we muſt <hi>ſerve him all the dayes of our life.</hi> The whole time of the hyreling is for his Maſters ſervice, and the whole time of a Chriſtian, for the ſervice of Chriſt: for he hath bought us with the price of his own bloud. Then it is an injury to the Lord Chriſt, becauſe he hath ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed us at ſuch a price for himſelf, if we do things to our ſelves, and not to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. It is dangerous to a mans ſelf.</note> as it is a diſhonour to God, and injurious to Chriſt, that men ſhould live to themſelves: ſo it is dangerous to a mans ſelf. And that will appear by comparing what we loſe by it; with what we gain by it. Compare our loſs and our gain together, and we ſhall ſee then, that we do our ſelves the greateſt miſchief, when we ſeek our ſelves moſt.
<note place="margin">1. A man in ſeeking himſelf, I ſeth his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</note> Conſider firſt what we loſe by it. Our happineſs. What is the happineſs of the creature, but the injoying of God? We loſe our end and perfection. What is the bleſſedneſs of the creature, but to obtain his end? What is the end of the creature, but the glory of the Creator? Then the creature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to perfection, and bleſſedneſs, and happineſs, when it is moſt empty of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <pb n="121" facs="tcp:47453:67"/>when he moſt perfectly, and with due affection ſeeks God. Therefore in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves, we loſe our happineſs. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo conceived of their bleſſedneſs: they let fall themſelves in the higheſt point of ſelf-love, when they ſtood in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, or oppſition againſt God. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired that <hi>his name might be blotted out of the book of life,</hi> rather then God ſhould be diſhonoured. And faith the Apoſtle, <hi>I could be content to be ſeparated from Chriſt, for my brethrens ſake:</hi> that is, that Chriſt may be glorified. He knew that his happineſs lay not in injoying a bleſſed eſtate to himſelf, free from care and trouble: but that herein his happineſs lay, that God may be glorified, and that he might bring it to paſs by any means, that he might ſerve God, in that end whereto God had appointed him: and the more perfectly he could attain that end, the more perfectly he ſhould attain his happineſs. So it is with a true Chriſtian, he is ſo far bleſſed, and happy in heaven as he is ſerviceable to God on earth, as he lives to him, and doth much, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much for him; when that life that he hath, is ſpent (in the ſeveral actions, and turnings, and changings of it) in the ſervice, and to the glory of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore I ſay conſider this: you loſe that which you ſeek: you ſeem to ſeek happineſs to your ſelves, by ſeeking wealth and pleaſures or earthly advantages to your ſelves; and while you ſeek them, with a neglect of duty to God, with a neglect of the diſcharge of that work and ſervice he hath committed to you: you loſe that happineſs that you ſeem to ſeek, and which you ſhould ſeek indeed, which is the perfection, the end of the creature: the ſervice of his Creatour. So you ſee what we loſe.
<note place="margin">That which he ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ns, is but a ſhadow of gain.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider ſecondly, what we gain. It may be you gain wealth for you ſelves: this is ſomewhat you will ſay. It may be you gain honour, and eſteeme in the World: you gain a name amongſt men, or ſome earthly advantage. Alas! what is this if it be rightly conſidered? It is but the gain of a ſhadow to the loſs of the ſoul. If it be wealth: doth it ſatisfie the ſoul? Doth it quiet the conſcience? Doth it fill aman ſo, as that he needs no more? All the wealth in the world cannot do this: there is an emptineſs in all theſe things: there is fulneſs to be had only in God, in Chriſt, in ſpiritual things: nothing elſe is able to ſatisfie the ſoul in all its deſires, to give it perfect peace.</p>
               <p>If the happineſs of a man where either in himſelf, or in any other creature, he need have nothing to do with God, he need not then to look higher above himſelf. But God hath placed a vanity both in men, and in all creatures: man is vain, and all the creatures in the world <hi>are vanity, and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> And when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth them vanity, what doth it mean, but that they are empty things? they have not that nouriſhment in them, that they ſeem to have; they have not that in them, that they ſhould have, according to that eſteem that men put upon them: they are empty things: as we ſay of wells, when they want water, they are empty, though they be full of other things, as duſt and ſand, &amp;c. Or as clouds that have no moiſture, and rain in them, they are empty: ſo are all things in the world therefore empty; becauſe they have not in them, that which the heart ſeeks after: they have not happineſs in them, they have not contentment in them. What is this then, but to forſake bread, and to ſeek after husks, like the Prodigal that left his Fathers houſe, where there was bread enough, and to feed on husks with ſwine? to leave the approach and acceſs of the ſoul to God, wherein it may ſatisfie it ſelf to the full, with that which is food indeed: and to ſeek ſomewhat in the world that it cannot get. I ſay, this is a mans loſs.</p>
               <p>Nay,
<note place="margin">3. He loſeth himſelf. Mat. 16.26.</note> he loſeth himſelf in living to himſelf: <hi>What ſhall it profit a man to win the whole world, and loſe himſelf?</hi> Mat. 16.26. <hi>To loſe his ſoul,</hi> ſaith one Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, <hi>to loſe himſelf</hi> faith another. A man loſeth himſelf, when he loſeth his ſoul. And this he doth in the neglect of God, he loſeth his ſoul in that action: when a man gathereth wealth by indirect means, or keepeth his wealth and douth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe it in the ſervice of God, for his glory, or whatſoever elſe a man doth; in gaining the world he loſeth himſelf.

                  <hi>He that will loſe his life ſhall ſave it, and he that will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it,</hi> Mark. 10. A man never loſeth a ſhadow more then when he followeth it: the faſter he purſues it, the faſter ſtill it runneth from <pb n="122" facs="tcp:47453:68"/>him: ſuch is the purſuit after anything out of God: the more a man purſueth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

This is the folly and madneſs of the world, whereby Sathan deludeth men, leading them after vain ſhewes of earthly delights, in carnal ſecurity, flattering themſelves in the purſuit of the world, dreaming of happineſs and comfort, and in the concluſion imbrace nothing but a ſhadow and emptineſs. and comfort, and in the concluſion imbrace nothing but a ſhadow and emptineſs. This I ſay is the miſery of man. Now put both together: Conſider what we loſe: that that is truly good, that that is bleſſedneſs indeed: and what we get: that that is but a ſhadow, that that is emptineſs indeed. Men loſe that they ſeem to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It ſerveth in the firſt place to convince us, that profeſs our ſelves to be Chriſtians, and beleevers, to be ſuch as know Chriſt (though with theſe differences, ſome are more weak, and ſome more ſtrong;) yet I ſay, it convinceth every man to ſtand guilty before the Lord, that if he live to himſelf, he is none of Chriſts. This is the property of every true Chriſtian, even of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, aſwell as of the ſtrongeſt (for the Apoſtle ſpeaks of all, <hi>None of us,</hi> ſaith he, whether weak or ſtrong Chriſtians, <hi>live to over ſelves</hi>) if thou therefore live to thy ſelf, thou art none of thoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks to: thou art none of thoſe <hi>that live and die to the Lord;</hi> thou art none of thoſe <hi>that are the Lords, whether in life or death.</hi> Let us therefore firſt be convinced of this, that there is ſuch a ſinful diſpoſition in the hearts of men, that profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, and yet live to themſelves.

If there were not ſuch a diſpoſition in mens hearts, the holy Ghoſt would not thus have directed the ſpirit of the Apoſtle, in expreſſing this, as a note of difference between them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and as an argument that a ſtrong Chriſtian, ſhould beare with the weak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they do not live to themſelves.</hi> The Scripture giveth not rules in vaine.</p>
               <p>But that yet we may ſee it more clearely:

               <p>Sometimes you ſhall ſee that a man is put on to a good duty by incouragement:

                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:47453:68"/>ſometimes he wants thoſe incouragements.

Sometimes you ſhall ſee that there is a command to a duty, but no outward incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to that duty, that may ſatisfie the deſire of a mans heart in ſelf-reſpects. He muſt obey God in this command, but he ſhall gain nothing in the world by it: he ſhall neither grow rich, nor get more eſteem among men, or have a more eaſie or pleaſent life in outward things: all ſelf-reſpects fail in this action. The queſtion is, what a man reſolveth upon in this? If now his heart ſtart aſide from God, and fall off from the duty, becauſe he wants thoſe incouragements that a man looks after, a way for himſelf, fulneſs to himſelf: then it is evident, thou haſt reſpect to thy ſelf. <hi>Jehu</hi> all the while, that his zeal to God might further him, and the better ſettle himſelf in the kingdom of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he can call others <hi>to come up and ſee his zeal for the Lord;</hi> but when his zeal had no ſuch baite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, and allurement to thoſe actions, then <hi>Jehu</hi> turneth againſt God, and falleth to Idolatry and other ſins: <hi>Jehu</hi> is not now the man, when theſe incouragements faile, that he was before.</p>
               <p>You have abundance in <hi>John</hi> 6.10.
<note place="margin">Joh. 6.10.</note> ſeeking Chriſt, that ſtill diſcovered a living to themſelves in it. <hi>You ſeek me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>becauſe of the loaves:</hi> they had ſome outward advantage by him, and therefore ſo long they ſought him.</p>
               <p>So the Lord diſcovered them in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 7.</note> to be ſuch as lived to themſelves even in holy duties: <hi>You cry unto me</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>but it is for corn, and wine, and oyle:</hi> for this they cryed: but when they had corn, and wine, and oyle, what zeal had they then? <hi>He that ſhould have been upright when he waxed fat, he kicked with the heel,</hi> as the Lord ſpeaks under the name of <hi>Jeſurum</hi> to Iſrael.
<note place="margin">Deut. 23.</note> That is one caſe: Conſider when things come thus, that ſometime thoſe worldly advantages fall off from a man in the profeſſion and practiſe of religion: if he fall off from the duty too, he is a man that liveth to himſelf. This was the caſe of the ſecond and third grounds, they <hi>received the ſeed with joy:</hi> that is, when they were ſenſible of comfort they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt, but afterward when <hi>perſecution aroſe for the Goſpel, they fell off, and took offence.</hi> Such as theſe <hi>live to themſelves:</hi> they ſeem to live to God, but it is to themſelves: and therefore when ſelf-reſpects fail, they fall off too.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Inſtance</hi> 2.</note> take another inſtance for the clearing of it; Suppoſe that not only ſenſible advantages fail, but ſenſible diſadvantages come in the world. A man is ſenſible that he ſhall diſadvantage himſelf much, if he go on in the wayes of obedience to God. It may be if he make conſcience of his wayes, he muſt make reſtitution of his eſtate, unjuſtly gotten. He muſt deny himſelf in a greater meaſure of pleaſures, that he hath unlawfully purſued. He muſt empty himſelf, in works of mercy, and piety, of a great part of his eſtate, for the good of others, that God may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his ſubſtance. He ſhall loſe ſome worldly friends; ſome eſteem among men. Here are ſenſible diſadvantages to a man. Now the Queſtion is, what he reſolveth to do? Here is the command of God; and here is (the thing whereupon the heart of man, and his affections are ſet upon) diſadvantages in the world. Theſe come together. Here is an occaſion for a luſt, a ſinful affection to expreſs it ſelf; If that be laid in the ballance, and ſhall prevaile above the other: that rather then I will endure diſadvantage in the world, I will neglect the way of ſerving God: this party liveth to himſelf: whatſoever good he did before in matters of religion, all was done to himſelf; I ſay when theſe two come together, as you know when two men walk together, and one ſervant followeth them, a man knoweth not whoſe ſervant he is till they part: but then when they part, a ſtranger may know whoſe ſervant he is: he followeth his own Maſter, and leaveth the other. So, when God and the world go together, God and a mans own advantages go together: when their is nothing commanded, but ſtandeth with his own advantages: ſo long a mans deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart may flatter, and delude, and miſguide him, he may go on in a falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and in a ſtrong conceit that he is in Chriſt, in a bleſſed eſtate. But when theſe two part: that I ſhall not only not advantage my ſelf, but ſenſibly diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage <pb n="124" facs="tcp:47453:69"/>my ſelf in outward things. Here now I ſay the the Queſtion is what a man doth. If I reſolve to cleave to my outward advantages, and leave God, and leave the wayes of God: I live to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>A man that liveth to God, you ſhall ſee it is otherwiſe with him: as for inſtance. <hi>David:</hi> when he might have had the kingdome of Iſrael ſomewhat ſooner, by ſin, he would not do it: his heart ſmote him, for cutting off the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>appe of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment; though he might have gained the kingdome of Iſrael by it, he would not lay his hands on the Lords anointed: And what was the reaſon of it? becauſe he would not advantage himſelf by diſobedience to God; he would rather want him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>What was the reaſon that <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he ſaw he was in an apparent hazard, not only of the loſs of honour, but of his life, and that for the performance but of one duty, prayer, and that but for a ſhort time: yet would not omit it, no not for a ſhort time, though he might by that not only have ſaved his life, but kept his honour in the Court: he prayed to God, even at that time, when he was forbidden: Why ſo? becauſe he lived to God, and not to himſelf. Had <hi>Daniel</hi> lived to, and ſought himſelf more then God, he would have diſpenſed with this, and ſaved both his life and honour, though he had offended God in that particular of omiſſion. But this is the diſpoſition of a heart that is faithful and upright with God: it will not diſhonour God for the greateſt advantage that can come to it ſelf: it will not neglect a duty to God, whatſoever loſs it have in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jnſtance</hi> 3.</note> Take another inſtance, whereby we may ſee what we intend in this try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Let the will of God, and the bent of a mans own will come in competition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. God will have me leave this: I will hold it. God will have me forſake this: I will keep it; It is a comfort, a wordly benefit: I loſe my comfort if I part with it. He that now liveth to himſelf, he will pleaſe his own will, and be diſquieted and vexed againſt Gods will that croſſeth his. But he that liveth to God, will be conten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> that God ſhould croſs him in his will: becauſe he would gloriſie God in his own will, in his ſoveraignty, in his purity, in his holineſs, and juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See it in the caſe of <hi>Abraham. Abraham</hi> had a ſtrong love to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and good cauſe: yet nevertheleſs though he could ſee a comfort to himſelf in this ſon, when God telleth him, thou muſt <hi>ſacrifice thy ſon Iſaac,</hi> when he had the revealed will of God: <hi>Abraham</hi> now reſolveth to ſhew that he lived to God, and not to himſelf: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would part with any comfort of his life for God, when he required it. So <hi>David, If the Lord will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he can bring me back, that I ſhall ſee the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and the Ark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> thee, loe here I am, let the Lord do with me, as ſeemeth good in his owneyes.</hi> When the caſe is this, when the will of God, croſſeth thy will: what now prevaileth? Doth the deſire of having thy own will prevail againſt the deſire of ſubmitting to Gods will? Doth it raiſe murmuring, and impatiency of ſpirit? So far thou liveſt to thy ſelf. Therefore conſider this. Here is an occaſion now for a luſt, and a ſinful affection to ſhew it ſelf: either a man may advantage himſelf in an evil courſe, or he cannot but diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage himſelf in a good courſe: or when God croſſeth a man in that he deſireth, and delights in, in the world. That is the firſt tryal whereby a man may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he liveth to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 2.</note> another tryal will be this; Conſider if their be any part of the truth of God, of his revealed will, that for ſelf-reſpects thou art willing to be ignorant of, leaſt the knowledge of it, ſhould make the do ſomewhat to thy own diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: in this thou liveſt to thy ſelf. See this to be true, in all that live to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balaam,</hi> though he profeſt, that for a houſe full of gold, he would not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the word of the Lord, yet notwithſtanding he was willing not to take notice of Gods will, but to go on rather to curſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Johanan</hi> in <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. profeſſeth deeply that he would obey the will of the Lord; but when he underſtood the will of the Lord, when it croſt his will: then ſaith he to <hi>Jeremy; It is not the Lord that hath bid the ſay this, but Baruch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When men cavil againſt any part of Gods word,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> or hide any truth from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <pb n="125" facs="tcp:47453:69"/>
                  <hi>and with-hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs;</hi> Here is a man living to himſelf. How many points are there in Religion, that many men are willingly ignorant of? And when they cannot but know them, how do they labour for diſtinction? how do they dawb over the matter, that they may hide the truth from themſelves, that it may not work upon their conſciences, to make them leave their profitable fins? Some would have the keeping of the Lords day according to Judaiſme, though it be revealed to them, that there is a broad difference between the <hi>Jews</hi> obſervation, and the Chriſtians keeping of it. Another man he will not underſtand Uſury to be a ſin, becauſe his courſe is uſurious: he will not know this willingly, becauſe he would not diſadvantage himſelf. Another will not underſtand what he is bound to do, to the glory of God with his eſtate: in what meaſure, according to all the good that God hath bleſſed him with, to honour God, and give the firſt fruits of all his increaſe: nor in what manner, that he ſhould be ready to every good work, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute willingly to the neceſſities of the Saints: what he ſhould do to pious and merciful uſes, what for publike, what for private occaſions: he would not willingly know theſe things: he ſhould have leſs eaſe he makes account. Thus when a man is not willing to be informed in any thing, to ſift the truth to the bottome, to the uttermoſt, to know any thing concerning a duty in any kind, when he laboureth not to convince his heart, to this end, that he may be brought in every thing to obey God, when he ſtandeth out with God in any one point: this man liveth to himſelf, and walketh not as he ſhould, according to the rule of God. Now then (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) let us be convinced of it, I beſeech you, take it home, and let every man conſider of it with himſelf. Sometime in the actions of religion there cometh matter of glory in the world, and this ſetteth me forward much: when theſe things are ſpoken againſt, and when I ſhall ſuffer diſadvantages, I cannot hold out. At a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time, though all things be well, yet if it croſs me in ſuch a courſe, I mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, as if it were an unprofitable thing to ſerve God. And then again when God revealeth his will, my froward and rebellious heart hath hung back, and been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſubmit to Gods will in this point: all this while I have lived to my ſelf. And if it be true: If a man be in Chriſt, he liveth not to himſelf, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: if a man liveth to himſelf, he is out of Chriſt; <hi>If the weakeſt Chriſtian live to Chriſt, then the beſt that liveth to himſelf is out of Chriſt.</hi> Be convinced of this firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. That it is an evil thing for a man to live to himſelf.</note> Be convinced, as it is the caſe of our ſelves: ſo it is an ill eſtate for a man to live to himſelf. You ſee ſtill it is the whole drift of wicked men to took to themſelves. <hi>Haman</hi> aimed at himſelf: when the King asked him, <hi>what ſhould be done to the man whom the King would honour?</hi> He thought, whom ſhould the King ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour but himſelf? He looked to himſelf. Here was the difference between <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> both had honour in the world: <hi>Haman</hi> ſeeks himſelf in all his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſeeks God, and his glory, and the welfare of his Church in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: A great difference. Saith <hi>Nabal: ſhall I take my bread, and my drink, and give it to a man that I know not?</hi> Here was a man that lived to himſelf. Compare him with <hi>Job; He was a foot to the lame, an eye to the blind;</hi> he continually fed thoſe that wanted food. A great difference: <hi>Job</hi> lived to God, and therefore he honoured God in releeving many with the eſtate that God hath given him: <hi>Nabal</hi> lived to himſelf, therefore he regarded none hut himſelf, and his own houſe, and ſheep-ſhearers, and thoſe that depended upon him. This is the property of a man out of Chriſt to ſeek himſelf, and live to himſelf in all things.</p>
               <p>Again conſider, others that have gone further in matters of religion, yet they have ſtill turned out of the way,
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.22.</note> as far as they have halted in this, <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.22. <hi>If thine eye be ſingle, the whole body is light: but if thine eye be wicked, the whole body is darkneſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A ſingle eye, what.</note> A wicked eye is ſuppoſed to a ſingle eye: a double eye is a wicked eye: What is a ſingle eye? That that looks but upon one object, upon God, and God onely, and God principally: and on all other things in him, and with reference to him. Now the double eye, is that, that though it looks to God, and do many things in obedience to God: yet it looks to ſomewhat elſe, and takes other things as greater incouragements: this is a wicked eye, and ſuch a man walketh in darkneſs: <pb n="126" facs="tcp:47453:70"/>when he looks to God, he hath light in the duty: when he looks to men, and other things, then he turneth aſide, and runneth to by-wayes: And therefore <hi>a double<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded man is unconſtant in all his wayes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1.</note> What is a double minded man? He is a double-minded man, whoſe mind is ſet upon more things then one: firſt on the world, and then on God: as far as he ſees it is profitable, he will ſerve God, or elſe not. This man is an unconſtant man. You ſee it is an ill eſtate.</p>
               <p>So much for the firſt Uſe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. For Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for conviction. Secondly therefore; As many as are guilty of this, labour to get out of it, not to live to your ſelves any more. Let it be enough, that you have lived thus long to your ſelves: that you have deſrauded Chriſt of his due, that hath puchaſed you with his bloud, and not ſerved him in holineſs and righteouſneſs, ſo many dayes of your life. Now for the time to come, let us ſerve him better.</p>
               <p>And that you may do thus.
<note place="margin">Helps.</note> I will give you two ſorts of directions, or helps. I can give you but the heads of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. Our good is in God, and not in our ſelves.</note> be convinced that our good is in God, and not in our ſelves: our life is in God, and not in our ſelves; our ſelves are in God, and not in our ſelves: that as the beams of the Sun are in the Sun, more then in themſelves, ſo a Chriſtian is more in Chriſt then in himſelf. Whatſoever is good and comfortable to him, is in Chriſt: he hath all by vertue of a union with Chriſt: he is not at all happy or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, further then he is in him. If then all our good lie in him, it is great reaſon all our actions ſhould returne to him: that he ſhould be the Center where all our lines ſhould meet;
<note place="margin">Ier. 9.24.</note> the mark whereto all our actions ſhould aym. <hi>Let not the ſtrong man glory in his ſtrength, or the wiſe man in his wiſdom, or the rich man in his riches; but he that glorieth, let him glory in this, that he knoweth me, that I am the Lord.</hi> Jer. 9.24. What Lord? <hi>the Lord that ſheweth judgment and righteouſneſs upon the earth:</hi> there is a mercy ſhewed to the creature, but it is I that do it, faith the Lord. If you meet with a merciful man, God is merciful in that man: If you meet with a bountiful man, God is bountiful in that man: If you meet with a man whoſe <hi>lips feed many,</hi> God inſtructeth that man. I ſay, ſeeing all things we have, though they have divers channels and pipes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances, whereby God conveyeth goodneſs and mercy to men, yet nevertheleſs, it is in God, and from God we receive all; let us therefore look upon every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as inſtruments in Gods hand, that can do us neither good nor hurt without him. What good it doth, it doth by the influence of the ſupream cauſe, working by that creature: let us ſo look upon, and conceive of every creature.</p>
               <p>Thus the Saints have done in all times. <hi>Jacob</hi> when he ſaw <hi>Eſau; I have ſeen thy face, as the face of God</hi> (ſaith he.) He ſaw God in the face of <hi>Eſau.</hi> So in all good men, we ſhould ſay, God is good in them. This ſhould make men not to ſeek themſelves; not to ſtudy men more then God: not to ſtudy gain with men, with the loſs of God: to pleaſe men, with the diſpleaſing of God: but to venture the loſs of all men, that they may pleaſe God, if they cannot keep men and God together. For the affections of men are in Gods hand, and he faſhioneth, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them, according to his own pleaſure, either to love, or hatred, as <hi>David</hi> obſerved in the caſe of <hi>Shimei, God hath bid him curſe.</hi> Be convinced, I ſay, of this, that if we get all the men in the world to be our freinds, with the neglect of God, if we get all the treaſures and wealth of the world: if a man were advanced to the Monarchy of the whole earth: yet theſe things are more in Gods hand, then in ours. When a man hath wealth, it is not in his own keeping: riches have wings. When a man hath favour, God gives it not into his own keeping: whatſoever we have, it is ſecured to us by Gods protection, and made good to us by his bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Let this be our care, and work therefore, how we may live to God: how we may enjoy God, in the things we enjoy, and poſſeſs God in all things we poſſeſs; in the things we have, ſtill to keep God, and that will keep our eſtates, and names, and comforts, and lives, and all. That is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly;
<note place="margin">2. Exerciſe the grace.</note> There are certain graces to be exerciſed, if a man would not live to himſelf (for indeed it is the property of a Chriſtian, and none elſe to live to God, and not to himſelf: and he doth it by vertue of thoſe graces in his heart, that <pb n="127" facs="tcp:47453:70"/>empties him of himſelf, and draws him to God: therefore, I ſay, there are certain graces that every one ſhould exerciſe, if he would not live to himſelf.) What are thoſe?</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Of knowledge.</note> the knowledg of God in Chriſt. Get a more full and particular, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental knowledge of God. All our looking to the creature is, becauſe we know not God perfectly:
<note place="margin">Cant. 5.1 Sam. 1.</note> if we did know him, we would account <hi>him the chiefeſſ of ten thouſand,</hi> the Church when ſhe knew Chriſt, ſaid ſo: we would account him (as <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Hannah; Am not I better to thee then ten ſons?</hi>) better then ten friends, then ten worlds. Get therefore a more full knowledge of God: that all power is in him: <hi>One thing have I heard once and twice, that power belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto God,</hi> ſaith he Pſalmiſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Of Faith.</note> Get faith in the exerciſe more. All the worthies of the Lord in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. What made them live ſo to God, and not to themſelves as they did? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they beleeved, they did it by faith: <hi>by faith Abraham denied himſelf: by faith Moſes for ſook the pleaſures of Egypt: by faith thoſe Worthies, of whome the world was not worthy, wandred up and down in ſheeps skins, and goats skins, and would not be delivered.</hi> When a man getteth intereſt in Chriſt by faith, he ſhall ſee that in him, that will ſatisfie all his deſires, and anſwer all his loſſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Of Love.</note> exerciſe Love. Faith works by love. The more we love God in Chriſt, the more perfectly we ſhall cleave to him: Love is a uniting grace, that uniteth the ſoul to Chriſt.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth me</hi> (faith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor. 5.) for we thus judge, if one died for all, then it is fit they that live ſhould not live to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> And the truth is, the more a ſoul loveth Chriſt, the more it will live to him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. For inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> a word of the laſt Uſe, and that for inſtruction. Being convinced that ſuch is the eſtate of moſt men, that they live to themſelves: and that whoſe eſtate ſoever it is, it is a ſinful eſtate, and argueth a man out of Chriſt: and that there is a poſſiblity of getting out of this eſtate. Let it be for inſtruction to all thoſe, that in ſome meaſure live to God, and not to themſelves: let it be to teach them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them more fully to live to him, and leſs to themſelves. A man ſimply cenſidered without any relation to others, or dependance upon an another man, he may pleaſe himſelf: but when a man is conſidered in his dependance upon God, and his relation to men: he muſt then obſerve the will of his Creatour, in that relation God hath ſet him: he muſt carry himſelf as his creature, and obſerve the end that the creature is appointed to. Nay, he muſt carry himſelf as a Chriſtian, and obſerve the good of the body: he muſt carry himſelf as a member, to do good to the whole. Let every Chriſtian labour to do this, if he would have comfort to his ſoul, that he doth not live to himſelf, that he is of the number of thoſe that are accepted of God in life and death. Labour to imploy, his time, and ſtrength, and gifts, and whatſoever he is, and hath, to the good of others: <hi>As every man hath received the gift, let him miniſter to others, as faithful diſpencers of the manifold grace of God.</hi> If you have received gifts, you have received them from God, you have received them for the good of others, you have received them as diſpenſers: let every man (faith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) diſpenſe the manifold grace of God: if the Apoſtle had ſaid, be diſpenſers of the grace of knowledge that you have, for the feeding of the ſouls of many: and not of your eſtates: or, relieve as many as you can with your eſtates, but take no care for their ſouls: but when he ſaith, be diſpenſers of the manifold gifts of God, his meaning is, that whatſoever I have wherewith I am able to do men good with, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be inward or outwards gifts, the gifts of the mind, or of the outward man, any thing whereby I can be advantageous to others; I muſt ſerve God and men in improving of that. He that will not live to himſelf, is bound to ſerve every man with every gift he hath.</p>
               <p>If God have furniſhed a man with inward gifts, the graces of his Spirit. If a man have knowledge, and faith, or experience, or comfort, whatſoever graces of the Spirit he hath, there are duties appointed, and a Communion of Saints expreſt, that men may be ſtirred up to exerciſe thoſe graces in that communion for the good of all the Saints.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. Eph. 4.9.</note> Therefore we are ſaid <hi>to have knowledge to profit with. And gifts to <pb n="128" facs="tcp:47453:71"/>edifie with.</hi> All that a man hath, God hath given him for this end, that God may be glorified by it: <hi>Hercin is my Father glorified, that you bring forth much fruit. Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> Men have much beneſit by the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in others, when they are improved as they ought, they are as lights amongſt men in the world. Grace when it is opened (like the Box of oyntment) raiſeth a deſire in others after it. Grace exerciſed and communicated to others, it ſheweth the amiableneſs of it. Chriſtians ſhould therefore do it, that they may make Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity lovely: that they may make the profeſſion of Religion amiable to the world, that is by communicating the graces of God to others. This every man ſhould do, in his place, in his perſon, take all advantages this way.</p>
               <p>And as it is good for others, ſo it is good for a Mans ſelf to do thus, a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth his own ſtore. <hi>Liberality</hi> (we ſay) <hi>is the beſt husbandry.</hi> There is no promiſe in the Scripture for hoarding up, there are many to diſtribute. I ſay it is the beſt husbandry in the world, eſpecially in ſpiritual things: it is as the oyl, increaſed in the pouring out: like the loaves, the more they were broken, the more they multiplied ſtill. We ſee the hand nourſheth it ſelf by adminiſtring food to the mouth: ſo a Chriſtian, not only exerciſeth, but increaſeth grace in himſelf by communicating grace to others.</p>
               <p>And what I ſay for ſpiritual, I ſay for outward things. If a man have wealth, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or any of theſe outward things, and an opportunity, he ſhould imploy them for others, that it may appear that he doth not live to himſelf. He that layeth up riches only for himſelf, and his family, liveth to himſelf. He that followeth his calling only for himſelf, and his family, liveth to himſelf. He doth that which a man out of Chriſt would do: but a man that would live to God, he muſt glorifie God with his eſtate. <hi>To do good, and to diſtribute, forget not, for with ſuch ſacrifices God is pleaſed,</hi> Heb. 13. <hi>Charge them that are rich in the world, that they be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but ready to diſtribute to the neceſſities of the Saints.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. It is a charge laid upon all, to glorifie God with their eſtates: with their Authority as they are magiſtrates: as <hi>Job</hi> faith, <hi>I was a foot to the lame, an eye to the blind, a father to the fatherleſs, a husband to the widow:</hi> He did all things for the good of others. All men are ambaſſadours ſent from God, for the good of the bodies, and ſouls of others. Am I a neighbour, it is for the good of the body and ſoul of every one that converſeth with me, according to the manifold gifts beſtowed upon me: and I live no further to God, then I do extend, and communicate all my particular gifts to the good of others, both for ſoul and body.</p>
               <p>Thus you have the point opened, and preſſed, concerning living to our ſelves, as a mark of thoſe that are Chriſts, that they do not live to themſelves. I beſeech you (brethren,) let this be the advantage of <hi>Funeral Sermons,</hi> that are preached upon the occaſion of the death of our deceaſed brethren, to teach us how to live. Let every man hereaſter reſolve to lead a profitable and fruitful life: to do all the good he can while he liveth, that <hi>for much good done to many, thanks may be given by many on his behalf.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I may briefly come to open to you the ſum of that that I have to deliver out of this Scripture:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Cobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
                  </note> I deſire you (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in the Lord) in few words, to take notice of the drift and ſcope of the holy Apoſtle in this place: and that is this.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Corinths</hi> (as it ſeemeth in the beginning of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) had written a Letter to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> wherein they did propound to him divers Caſes of Conſcience: and did intreat him, that he would ſend him judgement, concerning thoſe points. Some five or ſix we may gather they did write to him about.</p>
               <p>One was this; whether he thought it either a lawful, or a fitting thing for a man to marry.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was; Whether if a man were married, his Wife and he might not ſeparate themſelves one from another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:47453:72"/>The third was; If they did live together, whether it were lawful, for the one to deny to the other matrimonial benevolence</p>
               <p>The fourth; Whether if one of them being a Beleever, and the other an Infidel, it were lawful, or convenient for the beleever to remain a yoke-fellow to the Inſidel. Theſe and divers other caſes of concience, they intreated Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to reſolve them in.</p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle in the beginning of this Chapter writeth an Anſwer to every one of theſe Queſtions they propounded. To ſome of them he anſwered thus; <hi>Indeed I canuot give an abſolute determination what is to be done, but I ſuppoſe, this, and this is beſt.</hi> And to another. <hi>I adviſe ſuch a thing: I cannot directly determine the will of God, but I have received mercy of God to be accounted faithful, and if you would know my opinion it is this.</hi> And ſo he giveth divers doubtful an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to their Queſtions: only he telleth them, this is fitteſt for the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>When he hath done all, he cometh to this I have read. <hi>But this I ſay brethren,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay; The Queſtions I have given you an Anſwer to, I think you know not what to reſolve upon, becauſe I ſay only this is my counſel, or this is my opinion. But this I am peremptory in, that is, <hi>That they that have wives be as if they had none: they that weep, as if they wept not: and they that rejoyce, as if they rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not.</hi> This, I do not come to ſay, <hi>I ſuppoſe, and I think it ſit, or I give my adviſe, or for the preſent occaſion it is fit to be thus. But brethren,</hi> herein I am conſident, and reſolute, that <hi>you ſhould be as if not,</hi> in all things: in this I am bold. This is the driſt of the Apoſtle, that he would bring in one thing wherein he is conſident, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the reſolution of divers Queſtions, wherein he could not be ſo conſident.</p>
               <p>So then,
<note place="margin">Diviſion of the Text.</note> the words I have read, contain two general things.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 Preſace.</note> the Apoſtles Preface to his Exhortation.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the Exhortation it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The Preface in theſe words, <hi>But this I ſay brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Exhortation in the reſt of the words, <hi>The time is ſhort,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the Exhortation there are likewiſe three things that I would note unto you.
<note place="margin">In the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Eirſt,
<note place="margin">1. The ground of i.</note> the ground of the Exhortation in theſe words; <hi>The time is ſhort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly the Exhortation it ſelf,
<note place="margin">2. The Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it ſelf.</note> in theſe words: <hi>It remainech that they that have wives, be as though they had none: and they that weep, as if they wept not: and they that rejoyce, as if they rejoyced not: and they that buy, as if they poſſeſſed not: and they that uſe the world, as not abuſing it.</hi> Here is the Exhortation.</p>
               <p>Then the third thing,
<note place="margin">3. The motive.</note> is a ſpur the Apoſtle addeth to quicken them up, to practiſe all theſe things, in theſe words; <hi>For the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt general thing in the words,
<note place="margin">In the Preface.</note> is the Apoſtles Preface, <hi>But this I ſay brothren.</hi> And in this I would note but two things: I will but name them (becauſe I would not be ſtraitned in two principal points that I would gladly open.)</p>
               <p>Firſt here I would note:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſeavati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>How conſident, and earneſt, and reſolute a faithful mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will be, when he cometh to a point that mainly concerns his people.</hi> In all other things the Apoſtle giveth them his Anſwer, ſo as it might ſeem, he had not fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved them. <hi>I give my adviſe,</hi> (faith he) and again, <hi>I ſuppoſe this</hi> But now when he cometh unto the right uſe of the world, that it be not abuſed: and the thought of heaven, that they might ſet themſelves about it. Here he cometh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands,</hi> he ſetteth it down reſolutely and poſitively. <hi>Brethren, this I ſay, or this you muſt do.</hi> This is one thing that I might note.</p>
               <p>Secondly I might note;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The compellation, or term that he giveth them: Brethren.</hi> In which, note who they are, to whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth the Exhortation. And it ſeemeth to me, as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay; I am putting you now upon a duty, that if I could not give you the term, <hi>brethren,</hi> I ſhould hope to prevail little with you. To come and tell a young gallant that is in the middeſt of his ruſſe, and his jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and all pleaſures: <hi>the faſhion of this world paſſeth away,</hi> and I would have you <hi>uſe <pb n="131" facs="tcp:47453:72"/>theſe things, as if you uſed them not:</hi> I know he would not receive it. Or to come to an old ſoaked worldling, whoſe <hi>Mammon</hi> and penny is his God, whoſe thoughts run altogether upon his wealth: and to tell him, that <hi>he ſhould uſe the world, as if he uſed it not.</hi> Or to come to another that is newly married, and it may be hath made a Goddeſſe of his yoak-fellow for a while, and tell him <hi>that he muſt be as if he were not married:</hi> I ſhould have little hope to prevail with theſe. But you are <hi>brethren:</hi> and becauſe <hi>brethren</hi> you know the good things of God, you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with things concerning eternal happineſs: therefore as long as I can call you <hi>brethren,</hi> I am bold to put you upon the duty.</p>
               <p>So (brethren) this is my Preface to you. I ſhall anon ſpeak to a point that I ſhall have little hope to prevail with many in the Congregation: when I come to ſpeak of the immoderate uſe of the world, and all the bleſſings in it; it may be both your eares will be ſo ſtopped againſt it. But as many of you as are <hi>brethren,</hi> that have given up your ſelves to God, and have taken him for your portion, and his Word for your guide in all things: I hope you will bring willing and yeelding hearts, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that what is delivered out of the word of God, to embrace it, and to endeavour it, concerning the courſe of your lives. And ſo, this will ſuffice for the Preface, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as I ſaid) I would not be ſtraitned.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the Exhortation.
<note place="margin">In the Ehorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>It remaineth that they that have wives, be as if they had none,</hi> &amp;c. Firſt I will in brief open the words, and then come to ſome matter of inſtruction.</p>
               <p>I begin firſt with the ground of the Exhortation.
<note place="margin">2 The ground of it.</note> 
                  <hi>The time is ſhort.</hi> The word tranſlated <hi>ſhort,</hi> ſignifieth in the orignal, Time cut off. And ſo the Apoſtle aluded (as the beſt Expoſitors agree) to Seafayring-men: that have almoſt done their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
<note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note> and begin to ſtrike ſayle, and to fold them up together, and are even putting into the Harbour, and are going to unlade their goods. So faith the Apoſtle, <hi>the time is ſhort:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: if a company, that are going out a long voyage, ſhould ſtrive who ſhould be Maſter, and who be Maſters-Mate, and who ſhould have this or that office in the Ship, I could not greatly blame them. But when they are almoſt at home, when they are within a flight-ſhot of the ſhoar, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſtrike ſayle, to take in all, and to go themſelves out of the ſhip: then if they ſhould fall a quarrelling for places, and contend, and uſe all the friends and means they could make, it were a ridiculous thing, and folly. So it is with us. Time was when the world was in beginning, and then when a man came into the world, he might ſay, by the courſe of nature, I have a matter of ſix, or ſeven, or eight, or nine hundred years, to go on in my pilgrimage, before I ſhall end my voyage: and then if a man ſhould beſtow a little time to think with himſelf; Well, if I can live but to ſee my ſelf the father of a thouſand children, and might come to people almoſt a whole Couutry, &amp;c. then I ſay, if a man ſhould greet the world, he might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. But brethren, God hath caſt out the time of our age ſo, that aſ ſoon as we begin our voyage, we are ready to ſtrike ſayle preſently. We have but a little time to continue, and much work to be done for another life: therefore for us to ſtand ſtriving about wives and children, and courteſies: to cry out of afflictions, when we are ready to ſtrike ſayle, and even to go out of the ſhip into the harbour, it is a meer folly. Theſe things are not worthy the while, heaven is the thing we ſhould look after, therefore let us be moderate in all theſe things. This is the meaning.</p>
               <p>So that the ground of the Exhortation, affordeth two things. The one I will but name; The other I will ſtand upon.</p>
               <p>Firſt;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>The time of our life in this world is very ſhort.</hi> We have a very little time to continue in this world. This is a very fruitful and profitable point, but becauſe I would not be ſtraitned, and becauſe the Apoſtle intends it not as the main thing, I do but only name it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing (and that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mainly intends) is that becauſe we have but a little time,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 2.</note> we are even ready to ſtrike ſayle, and to go to the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour preſently, therefore <hi>he that had a wife ſhould be as if he had none, and he that uſed the world, as if he uſed it not,</hi> &amp;c. And there the Leſſon that I no<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e is this;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47453:73"/>
                  <hi>That the ſerious meditation of the little and ſhort time that we have to remain in here below,
<note place="margin">The meditatl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our lives, a ſpecial means to take us off of the world.</note> ſhould be a great means, to cut us off from the world, and to put us upon thoughts and actions concerning heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not need to give you a better ground of the point then is in the Text. <hi>The time is ſhort</hi> (ſaith he) the time is contracted, you are ready to ſtrike ſayle: therefore do this.</p>
               <p>I might give you a world of Scripture to prove this. But I will ſatisfie my ſelf in laying you down two or three grounds of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> we know, that all things that ever a man can enjoy in this world, they all die, aſſoon as ever this time is gone. Mark it: All things here below, let a man dote never ſo much upon them: let him have wife, and children, and beauty, and credit, and pleaſures, and learning, or whatſoever it is, if his glaſs be out, if his time be gone, thers is an end of all thoſe to him. Now, the ſoul of man careth not for that happineſs, that hath no continuance at all in it; Yea, the rareſt thing that mortal men ſeek, if they ſhould know before hand that they ſhould enjoy them but a little time, the ſoul careth not for pitching upon it. If a man were offered the goodlieſt woman for his wife, that ever lived in this world: if God ſhould ſend him this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; there take her, I beſtow her freely upon thee, but to morrow thou ſhalt die: who would care for marrying? To be a King, we know, is ſimply the greateſt thing that men ſeek after in this world: yet among the Grecian Cities (as that of <hi>Sparta</hi>) becauſe one was but to have the Kingdome but for a year, and then to lay down his Crown, and become a private man: all the wiſeſt men of the City, ſtrove as much not to the King, as we to get great places. Why? becauſe they knew that that honour was but for a year; and that would be gone preſently, therefore they cared not for it. So the Apoſtle teacheth in this place. Though thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have a wife that thou ſhouldeſt love mightily: though thou ſhouldeſt have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that thou takeſt full content in: Why doeſt thou ſo? We are ready to ſtrike ſayle; we have but a little time to continue. So that becauſe all the bleſſedneſs of this life, let them be never ſo many, never ſo great, yet they all die with us, when our time is ended: he that could but ſeriouſly think, that he hath but a little time to continue below, he will never let his heart be ſet violently upon them: that is the firſt Argument.</p>
               <p>The ſecond,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> and principle Reaſon, why the meditation of the ſhortneſs of our time ſhould be ſuch a marvellous means to take us off, from all the things of the world is this. Becauſe we ſhall find work enough in this ſhort time, for things that more concern us. Now the very nature of our ſoul that God hath put into us, is this that a man cannot intend earneſtly and violently, two things at the ſame time. Let a man for a certain hour wholly be took up with ſome buſineſs, though there were a great many other things, that be could find in his heart to think upon: yet the ſoul intends that one mainly, and can find no time for the other. This is our caſe. We have but a little time: but in that little time, admirable is the work we have to do, before this time be ſpent, if we would give a comfortable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>What have we to do?</p>
               <note place="margin">What is the principall thing we have to do in the world.</note>
               <p>I tell you in a word. The main and needfull thing of all that we have to do in this little time here allotted us, is; How to ſhoot the gulph of hell: how to make our peace with God: how to get his favour in Chriſt; how to have the corruptions of our ſoul cured and healed; how to grow up in grace, and to get ſure evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that day, when all ſhall ſtand naked before him, that then we may be found in Chriſt. Have I ever heard that I have a great work to do, and that I have but a little time to do it in? Surely then if I ſeriouſly think of it, I cannot find in my heart, to let my ſoul pitch earneſtly upon the things below. Beloved, our time here, is the only time we have to make heaven ſure. It is the moſt precious thing that ever we have in the world. Now if a man have ſuch a precious thing, and but a little of it, will he go and ſpend it for toyes and baubles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:47453:73"/>It is a thing that the Emperour <hi>Caligula</hi> is laughed at for, in all Stories. There was a mighty Navy provided, admirable and ſtrange, and all trimmed: and every one expected, that with it, the whole countrey of Greece ſhould be conquered: and ſo it might have been. But he imploped his ſouldiers to gather a company of Cockleſhells, and Pibbles, and ſo ſayled home. Had not every one cauſe to laugh at the folly of this Emperour? Verely, ſuch a fool is every man, and ſo we would acknowledge, if we would but weigh this: God hath given thee but thus much time, it may be twenty years, it may be but a day or two more: in this time he hath furniſhed thee with that, which may be a means to conquer heaven it ſelf: now if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>You ſhall find evermore in the Scripture, the Spirit of God putting the neglect that is amongſt men,
<note place="margin">The ground of all our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of heaven, is he want of the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſhortneſs of this life.</note> and careleſneſs of heaven, and all the wickedneſs of their lives upon this, the not ſerious meditation of that ſmall time they have to continue below.</p>
               <p>If a man come to thoſe that are not brethren, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> beſpeaks the Corinths in the Text: they will ſay; It is true, it is a good point to be preſt upon a man that is in a conſumption, on one whom the Doctors have given over: to tell him that he cannot continue a week, that his time is ſhort. But for our parts we are but in the beginning of our voyage: it may be, we are but twenty years old: we began but the other day to be furniſhed with a ſtock: we are but newly entred: and do you think that we are ſtriking ſayle? Or another, that hath lived forty or fifty years, in the middeſt of a full trade, that beginneth to get ſomething in the world: do you think that he is ſtriking ſayl? Thus people put it off. Alas! what is thy time? What is all thy life? Let God decide it: doth not he ſay, <hi>it is a vapour, a dream, a tale that is told, like a Ship that ſayleth by, and is gone;</hi> and that in the turning or a hand almoſt? If thou have no more time of life here, but only while a little ſand is running out of a glaſs, while a Ship is ſayling out of ſight, while a ſhort tale is told. (God ſaith it is no more) wilt thou account that thy voyage is yet ſcarcely begun?</p>
               <p>I beſeech you (beloved) all go home, and often think of this point. Say within your ſelves: How long Lord, am I like to continue below? and what is there for me to do before I go out of this world?</p>
               <p>But the truth is,
<note place="margin">Sathan labours above all thing to make men put off the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the brevity of their lives.</note> men dare not think of this: and the Devil laboureth for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in the world then this, to make men put off the ſerious conſideration of the brevity of their lives, and that they have longer time to continue here, then they have: becauſe he knows the truth of this, that I have ſpoken, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation thereof will ſtir them up, to make clear all reckonings with God, before they gohence, and he ſeen no more. You may find this to be true in your own 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47453:74"/>experience, how loath men are to entertain thoughts of their latter end: Go to one that lies ſick of a Conſumption, and he will tell you: the Docters ſay, that I may live, and I doubt not but I ſhall get up again, ſuch a one hath been brought as low as I, and he is recovered, and why may not I? I once knew one that when the Phiſitians came and told him, that he muſt die: Good Lord (ſaith he) what a deal of work have I to do: I have all my ſeed to ſow: all my evidences to ſeal, that my ſoul ſhould he ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such thoughts ſhould enter into us now: pitch on them ſeriouſly: buckle to them ſoundly.</p>
               <p>We may learn this point of wiſdome of the divel himſelf; He, becauſe he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his time is ſhort, he is ſo much the fuller of rage and malice; and plies his work with ſo much the more eagerneſs. <hi>Wo be to the Inhabitants of the earth, and the Sea,</hi> (Revelat. 12.12.) <hi>for the divel is gone out amongſt men, having great wrath becauſe he knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time:</hi> So ſhould we do. Think with thy ſelf: the <hi>ſeventh Angel</hi> will come ere long, <hi>and ſweare by him that liveth for ever and ever, that there ſhall be no more time;</hi> but GOD will have an account for the time paſt. What if the <hi>Angel</hi> ſhould come now and ſwear (as ten to one but there is ſome man or woman in this Congregation, concerning whom GOD hath determined, that they ſhall have no more time before a week be at an end) Put the caſe it ſhould be any ones caſe, thine or mine, that God ſhould ſay, Go fetch ſuch a man, I will give him no more time; It is true, I give him ſome, but now his voyage is at an end, his ſayl is ſtruck: and then we ſhould have all to ſeek, no Chriſt, no true faith, no evidence for Heaven; when we muſt come and give an account to God. What have you done with all your time? will God ſay? I muſt have a reckoning of it.</p>
               <p>And then cometh in, <hi>Imprimis,</hi> ſo much time in drinking, ſo much in revelling, ſo much in dreſſing my ſelf every day. And then God ſhall ſay; Were theſe the things I give you time for? Did I beſtow time on you, for to be ſpent about ſuch things as theſe? No, it was for Heaven. Beloved, how could we anſwer to theſe things?</p>
               <p>It is good and profitable, ſeriouſly to conſider of this betimes: ſay to thy ſelf, I have not long to live, after awhile I muſt go hence, and be no more: <hi>I muſt give an account, and a reckoning unto God, of all that I have done, whether it be good or evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not the principal point I have to ſpeak of,
<note place="margin">2. The exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it ſelfe.</note> therefore I paſs it briefly. I come to the Exhortatiou it ſelf. <hi>It remaineth that both they that have wives, be as though thy had none; and they that weep, as if they wept not; and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not; and they that uſe the world, as not abuſing it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In a word:
<note place="margin">The meaning of the words.</note> I take the ſum of the exhortation to be, as if the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid thus;<lb/>
                  <hi>Brethren; you are ready to caſt anchor; trouble not your ſelves: be ſtedfaſt; gird up the loynes of you minds: let your care be greateſt for heaven: as for theſe things that are here below, if you have wives, be as if you had none; think, aſſoon as you are aſhoar, you ſhall have none: if you be ſick, or under any croſs, or affliction, be as though you wept not: ſuppoſe you be as a fellow that is fain to plie the pump all the day, aſſoon as he is aſhoar, he is free : if you rejoyce, if you be in proſperity, if you be as the Maſter of the Ship that hath great preferment, be as if you rejoyced not: Why? you are almoſt come aſhoare; therefore be, as if not in all theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will briefly open the meaning of all theſe particulars, and then put all into one point of inſtruction, and ſo come further to apply it unto you, as God ſhall enable me.</p>
               <p>What therefore is the meaning?
<note place="margin">What is meant by having wives and yet to be as having none.</note> firſt, <hi>Let them that have wives, be as though they had none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that I anſwer; A man that hath a Wife hath two things that another hath not, that hath no wife.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, He hath a great deal of joy and comfort: he hath a ſecond ſelf, a <pb n="135" facs="tcp:47453:74"/>loving yoak-fellow; one in whoſe Boſome he can pour his heart at any time: one that he can make partaker of all his contentments: one that is willing to help him to carry all his croſſes: ſo in a Wife (ſuppoſing her to be a good Wife) he hath that comfort that another knows not of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he that hath a Wife, hath a great many cares that another hath not: he hath a great deal of fear leſt he ſhould leave her in diſtreſs: a great deal of care how ſhe, and the children that are begotten by him of her, ſhould be provided for, when he is gone: ſo that as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he cannot but care for the things of the world, how he may give content to his wife. Theſe two things a man hath, that hath a Wife.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>What is it to be in this, as if he had no wife?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is this; In all contentments that come by a wife to uſe them as if he had none at all: that is, to be moderate, not to glut himſelf, and to think, now I am a happy man, I need no more, God hath given me ſuch a yoak-fellow, and I have abundant joy in it. But to moderate his heart in this.</p>
               <p>And for the other thing, for care, and thought how to provide for her and her children: to go on, as if he had no wife and children to provide for: to leave all to God: to go on in his calling in obedience to God, and let God do what he will. And for matter of providing food and rayment, when he is gone, let him even car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry himſelf, as if all the world were gone, when he is gone. <hi>This is to have a wife, as if he had none:</hi> to be as moderate in the injoying of the contentments that come by his wife: to be as moderate in cares required for a Wife, ſo moderate in them, as if he had no wife at all to joy in, or to take care for.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond;
<note place="margin">2. By weeping as if they weept not.</note> 
                  <hi>They that weep as if they wept not.</hi> That is, for matter of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffliction. One man cometh out, and he exceedingly glorieth in his happineſs that he hath a wife. Another complaineth: no man is ſo full of croſſes as I: every day one croſs after another: no man hath ſuch children: ſuch a husband: ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, ſo poor, ſo afflicted, ſo weak: ever groaning and complaining. Now, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul: be as if not, in weeping.</hi> That is, let the thoughts of the neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſhoar make you ſo contented, as if there were no croſs at all lying upon you. For (I ſtill follow the Metaphor the Spirit of God uſeth) he that is the pooreſt man in the Ship, he that doth nothing but dreſs the ſayles, and (as I ſaid before) ply the pumpe, and it may be is beaten withal: yet in the midſt of all theſe, he thinketh, I ſhall by and by caſt Anchor, and though I work hard, yet one hour more will make me free. So it ſhould be with us, in all afflictions, <hi>as if not:</hi> that is, Think, Death will come and end all, I am ſick in body, I am croſt in my good name, in my yoak-fellow: Well Death will end all theſe, I have but a little while ro tarry in this world, and ſhort things muſt not be tedious.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide;
<note place="margin">3 By rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced not.</note> 
                  <hi>He that rejoyceth, as though he rejoyced not.</hi> That is, in all the contentments of the world: in all the joy a man hath in the things below: as ſuppoſe a man have an eſtate here, and credit given him, or any thing that makes the world account a man happy; Remember, all theſe things will be gone aſſoon as I die: as (ſtill to uſe the compariſon) let it be the Maſter of the Ship, he may think with himſelf: all theſe are under me, I can command them, and puniſh them if they diſobey: yet as ſoon as I am out of the Ship, they are as good as my ſelf. I am now neer the ſhoar, and ſhall be ſoon out of the place I am in, let me therefore moderate my ſelf. So let us in all worldly contentments be ſo moderate, as if we ſhould take our leaves of them, and they of us.</p>
               <p>And ſo for a man,
<note place="margin">4. By buying as If poſſeſſed not</note> 
                  <hi>to be as though be poſſeſt not.</hi> That is, for a man not to inlarge his heart, as the world is enlarged. But if I have now ſo many pounds, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with buy ſuch a purchaſe, and ſuch a purchaſe: let me live, and carry my ſelf in my thoughts, as if I had nothing but food and rayment.</p>
               <p>And then,
<note place="margin">5. By uſing the world as not abuſing it.</note> laſtly cometh in the main of all the reſt: <hi>They that uſe the world, as not abuſing it.</hi> By <hi>world</hi> he means, all the good things of the world, all that I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before, and all that you can elſe think of; Wife, and children, proſperity, and adverſity, every thing on the right hand, and on the left, all cometh within the compaſs of the World: uſe all theſe things ſo. But eſpecially he aimeth at world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47453:75"/>
buſineſſes, the things we are exerciſed about: do them as not abuſing them, as not letting your hearts be ſet too much upon them: but be temperate and moderate in all, that we may ever be fit for that great ſervice that God hath to imploy us in.</p>
               <p>Now, out of all theſe put together: the main Leſſon that I would ſpeak of is this;<lb/>
                  <hi>That the true ſervants of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> 
                  <hi>true beleevers: all the bleſſings and croſſes they meet with in this world, they muſt have them, as if they had them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the point I would open to you. That in wife. children, proſperity, croſſes, think what you can, a beleever muſt be in them, <hi>as if not:</hi> as if he were not in that condition.</p>
               <p>To give you for the proof of this any other Scripture then my Text, I ſuppoſe I need not: the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (you ſee) layes it down in ſo many words. Yet, for the better confirmation of the point, I will add to that, two or three other plain places. Only firſt, I would a little explain to you, what it is for a man to uſe all theſe things, as if not.</p>
               <p>And I cannot for my life,
<note place="margin">Opened.</note> better lay it open to you, then by ſuch a compariſon as this. Look how worldly men uſe the things of heaven: ſo a heavenly man uſe the things of the world.</p>
               <p>To inſtance in a few duties that I will but name.
<note place="margin">A beleever is to be to the world as a worldly man to the things of heaven.</note> Suppoſe it be the duty of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Bring me out a true beleever, and a worldling, let them both be put upon this duty of prayer. The true beleever, his heart, before he goes to prayer, is ſo full of care, that he may pray aright: ſo full of fear, leſt his heart ſhould not carry it ſelf as it ſhould, when he is in the duty: his heart is ſo violently bent to it: it ſo ſtrugleth and ſtriveth, that he may do it, as may pleaſe God. When he hath done, he hath much joy and comfort, if he have carried it well: and much ſorrow and griefe, if he have carried it ill. Thus a religious heart carrieth it ſelf in this duty. Now a worldly man doth the duty too: but how? as if not: that is, he hath none of this care before he cometh to it: he hath none of this trouble when he is at it: he hath none of this perplexity, when he hath done, if he have miſcarried in it, if he be able to come off, it is well enough, though it be performed in never ſo ill a manner: Why? his mind is after other things, he intends greater matters, as he thinks. The Miniſter hath taught him to pray, and he can ſay his prayers, and ſo he doth the duty, but ſtill, as if not.</p>
               <p>Or again, ſuppoſe a man whoſe heart is ſet upon Mammon, put this man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation; he may perhaps find time to play at Bowles, or Cards, or Tables with a friend: but how? he cares not whether he wins or loſes: he whiles away the time, but this is not the thing his heart is ſet upon, that giveth him contentment: but that which his mind is on, is his commodities, his trade, his merchandize, his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the world.</p>
               <p>Juſt thus (beloved) it muſt be with every true beleever in the uſing of all the things of this life, that is, without care, without fear, without perplexity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtraction, and if they come on, ſo: if they go, ſo: he muſt be pleaſed if he have them, and content if he want them: and howſoever, his thoughts muſt be carried higher and better. To think thus, I am the ſervant of God, I have a Calling here, I will follow it in obedience to God. I have a Wife, I will uſe her as a wife ſhould be uſed: I have children, I will have a care of their education. But I muſt not come to be diſtracted, about my calling, about my wife, and children, and ſervants, and good name, or any thing that is here below. I am here to day, it may pleaſe God, I may be gone to morrow: my hearts deſire muſt be, to be content with this that God is my all-ſufficient portion: if I be in proſperity, to be, as if not: if in affliction, to carry my ſelf ſo, that in the middeſt of ſorrow and trouble, to be as if God freed me from all, remembring ſtill that my portion is in another life.</p>
               <p>Thus you have ſeen both the leſſon ariſing from the Text, and what that is, that in it is required of every true beleever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:47453:75"/>And this point I am now to prove, and ſtill I muſt uſe the compellation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Brethren,</hi> for as for others I have little hope of. I will (as I promiſed) make it plain out of the Scripture,
<note place="margin">Proved by Scripture.</note> 
                  <hi>That a true beleever, that would have comfort of it, that he is a true believer, muſt be, as if not in all the things of this world.</hi> There is one eminent place for this purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. Saith the Apoſtle there, <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 4.10.</note> 
                  <hi>if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Hence I argue thus; He that muſt ſo uſe wife, children, credit, freinds, good name, proſperity, without loving of them, it is likely he uſeth them <hi>as if not:</hi> for love is the great wheel that ſetteth all the faculties awork: Now the Spirit of God doth directly forbid all Chriſtians to love the world, or the things of the world, (as they do) the Scripture abſolutely injoyneth that we ſhould not love them, that is, that our hearts muſt not be fixed on them.</p>
               <p>Another place you have likewiſe in <hi>Colloſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col 3.1.</note> 3.1. <hi>Set not your affections on things below.</hi> Now (as I ſaid before) if any man do any thing, that his affections are not upon, that he doth not love, and joy, and delight in, that he doth not take care for, and the like, certainly that man <hi>uſeth it as if not:</hi> but ſo muſt every true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, uſe the things of the world ſo, as that he muſt not ſet his affections upon them.</p>
               <p>Other Scriptures I might give you, to make good this point, but I am ſomewhat afraid to be ſtraitned. Two or three arguments I will add to make it plain, <hi>Why every true beleever muſt be as if not, in all theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">By reaſon. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> becauſe all the things in this world (which are contained in the Text) they are all but empty poor things to a beleever. To another man who makes them his God (in his conceit) they are full;
<note place="margin">The things of the world are emptle things to a beleever.</note> but to a true beleever theſe things are well known to be but empty things. I need give you no better proof to make this evident, then that which followeth in the Text: <hi>For the faſhion af this world paſſeth away. The faſhion of the world,</hi> What is that? That is, a thing that is a ſhew without a ſubſtance. Nay, the world ſigniſieth, ſuch a faſhion, as is in a Comedy, or ſtage-play, where all things are but for a while to pleaſe the eye: A man it may be acts the part of a King, that is no better then a begger or a varlet: ſo all things in the world are no better then ſhadowes and empty, like a piece of a ſtage-play: and no marvel if beleevers that know this uſe them, as not.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The things of the world are none of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</note> another argument why beleevers muſt in all theſe things uſe them as if not, is, becauſe they are none of a beleevers, and being none of his, it is a meer folly for him, to ſet his heart upon them. How are they none of his, you will ſay? Firſt, for the truth of it, theſe things below, they belong to the men of this life: but the treaſure and eſtate of a Beleever is laid up in another life; he is but as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and pilgrim here below, and therefore they are none of his. And then likewiſe they are none of his, becauſe he hath reſigned them all up to God, in the day when he made the bargain for Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Note.</note> For when we come to be Chriſts, we muſt ſell all to buy that Pearl, and in ſelling all, we ſell not only our corruptions and luſts, but wives and children, and pleaſures, and credit, and all: we have them not now to have and to hold, to do what we will with them: but now that we have Chriſt, we return all to him, and have them as Coppy-hold, to be tenants at will to that great Land-lord: we have only a little time in them. And if it be ſo, that every beleever hath no more to do in this world but thus: that he is meetly at the pleaſure of God, and can properly call nothing his own, but God and Chriſt, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he muſt uſe all theſe things as if not. Conceive it thus. A Traveller, goeth a long journey, hee cometh at night to his Inn, when he is there, he is woundrous glad, of his table, of his bed, of his fire, of his meat and drink, and every thing, and he is woundrous welcome; but he doth not ſo delight in them, as the Hoſt of the houſe, who is living there, and is right owner, and hath the whole eſtate: No, he only reſteth there for a night after his weary journey, but on the morrow, God be with you, then he is gone. So a worldly man, he may ſay here is my eſtate, here is my ſtock, all that I have is laid up here. But a beleever ſaith, I am now in my journey, I am here, no other, then a pilgrim, my home is in Heaven, and while I am paſſing through this pilgrimage; If I have a piece of meat in my hunger, <pb n="138" facs="tcp:47453:76"/>and a cup of drink in my thirſt, and clothes in my nakedneſs, there is all that I care for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. The things of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>he world hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a beleever in the ſervice of God.</note> the laſt and the main Argument to prove that every true beleever <hi>muſt be, as if not,</hi> in all the things of this world; is, becauſe if he be any otherwiſe in them, hee will be ſo intangled, that he ſhall not be fit for the ſervice of God. And this third Argument will be of the greateſt force to a true beleever. For the other two, you will ſay, if they be none of mine, why do I meddle with them? and if they be empty, why likewiſe do I meddle with them? But now thirdly, if I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with them, they will make me directly that I ſhall not be a Chriſtian, they will hinder me from the ſervice of my God; this will make a beleever of all things, to look about him. The Apoſtle ſaith directly, <hi>that none that warreth intangleth himſelf:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> that is thus: Suppoſe a man have received preſs-money to go a ſouldier, will he be ſo mad as to lay out his money upon a Farm in the Countrey, when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the command of his Captaine, upon pain of death, he muſt follow preſently. Beloved he that intangleth himſelf with the things of the world, and of the fleſh, if his wife, his pleaſures, his credit, or any thing have taken up his heart: or if ſorrows and afflictions drink up his ſpirits, and eat up his very ſoul; when God calls this man now to come to prayer, to come to the Church, to hear his Word, to fight againſt his luſts, or to do any duty, alas! his head, his heart, and all, are eaten up, with his Farme, with his oxen, with his wife, with his croſſes and afflictions: ſo that he is altogether unfit for any ſervice that God hath called him to. Therefore (ſaith Saint <hi>John</hi>) he that intangleth himſelf with theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he cannot poſſibly have the love of the Father dwelling in him.</p>
               <p>This ſhall ſuffice for the clearing of the point, I have ſpent the more time in it, becauſe I would fain lay as good a foundation as I might, that the Application may take the deeper impreſſion in your hearts.</p>
               <p>We that live in the Country,

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> when we come up by occaſion into the City, and here ſee all men ſo full of trouble, every man ſo toyled in his work, ſo full of buſineſs, and ſo little time taken for any thing elſe, me thinks that ſuch a point as this to <hi>Brethren,</hi> to beleevers, ſhould be of ſpecial uſe. Now (beloved) this is the ſum of that I have to ſay; <hi>Be in all theſe things, as if not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shall we all reſolve, as obedient children to carry this point home, and examine indeed,
<note place="margin">Reprehenſion.</note> and in truth, whether we be in theſe things, as if not. But alas what ſhall I ſay? I remember a ſtory of one <hi>Thomas Lennot,</hi> a learned Engliſh-man, who reading once in the fifth, ſixth, and ſeventh Chapters of S. <hi>Mathews</hi> Goſpel, how our Saviour Chriſt faith; <hi>You have heard how it hath been ſaid of old, you muſt do thus, and thus; but I ſay unto you, you muſt love your enemies, pray for them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and perſecute you;</hi> and ſo he goeth on in injoyning ſuch ſtrange duties to fleſh and bloud. He breaks out; <hi>Oh Jeſus, either this is not thy Goſpel, or we are not Chriſtians.</hi> Truly (beloved) I would to God a Miniſter might not have juſt cauſe to ſay ſo in this point, that when he cometh, and reads this of the Apoſtle; <hi>It remains (brethren) that he that hath a wife, be as if he had none; he that uſeth the world, as not abuſing it: and he that buyeth, as if he poſſeſſed not,</hi> &amp;c. And muſt it be thus, if we mean to be Chriſtians? I would to God (I ſay) a man might not break out, and ſay; <hi>Oh Paul, either thou art not the writer of this, or we are no Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We talk and proſeſs it in words, that we purpoſe to do it but, if we come to the deed, and the truth, it is clean contrary, we are not at all moderate in the uſe of theſe things. In matters of Heaven, and in things that concern our everlaſting welfare, where God would have <hi>us take the kingdome of heaven with violence:</hi> Where we ſhould cry out as the <hi>Horſe-leach his daughter; Give, give, and never ſay it is enough:</hi> We are even like children that go to ſchool, that care not how little they have for their money, In hearing, if the Sermon be but half an hour, we think it enough: and in prayer, and in conference, a little will ſerve the turn. Like the Jeſuit, that when he thought he had a revelation, he cryed out, <hi>Satis Domine, enough Lord;</hi> I have revelation enough: So we in matters of Religion, <hi>Enough Lord.</hi> But turn us to wives, to children, to cloaths, to honours, to <pb n="139" facs="tcp:47453:76"/>preferments, to riches, to eaſe, to pleaſures, and the like; there we are as the barren womb, that never faith it is enough. Brethren, is it not thus?</p>
               <p>But me thinks I ſhould bring you ſome particular inſtances to convince you,
<note place="margin">Particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> that it is thus: and I would to the Lord I could throughly convince you of it, that thus it is with you. But to inſtance a little. Suppoſe now, a man comes and meets with a Citizen in his buſineſs, and ſay to him; How have you ſpent this day? Truly (he will ſay) I am ſo full of buſineſs, that I have not time ſo much as to eat my meat. But I hope, you have been at prayer in your family, have you not? Alas (will he ſay) I cannot get ſo much as a quarter of an hours time. Do you call this as if not, brethren? Come to another, that hath a wiſe: all his care is for her: oh my wife and children, if I ſhould die, and leave them poor, what ſhould I do? when I ſleep, I dream of them; when I awake in the morning, my thoughts are of them. Is this to be as if you had no wife and children? Another, he is ever a complaining and mourning, oh, I have ſuch croſſes, I am ſo full of affliction; I have loſt ſuch, and ſuch friends; and ſuch, and ſuch an eſtate: and though I go to Church and hear, ſuch and ſuch comfortable doctrines, one after another, and all telling me, of the all-ſufficiency of God, of the comforts and joyes of the Spirit, of the good things that are laid up in Heaven: yet like <hi>Rachel, they will never be comforted for their brother, for their ſiſter, for their children,</hi> &amp;c. What ſhall we ſay to theſe things? Do you think the Lord ſpeaks not as he meaneth? or that the Apoſtle, when he ſaith here abſolutely and determinatly, that thus and thus you muſt do if you be Chriſtians, if you be <hi>brethren?</hi> Shall we do the contrary to all this, and yet think that all will be well?</p>
               <p>I know you may put it off (many of you) and alledge many things: we have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and we muſt follow our Callings: if God brings me in imployment, blame me not if I follow it: And I know not how to live, if I do not do thus and thus.</p>
               <p>But be not deceived,
<note place="margin">How to know whether we uſe the things of the world, as if we uſed them not.</note> God is not mocked. In a word therefore, to put you on the tryal. If thou findeſt in the middeſt of thy trading, and merchandizing, or whatſoever calling thon art of, thy heart daily gathering towards heaven: that thou canſt ſay, bleſſed be God for this, and other commodities, but Chriſt is my darling: this is good. And then, in theſe things, if thou haſt a care to uſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, as well as to get them, and to thank God for them, and that thy project is, how thou ſhalt do good with that thou haſt, that thou art alwayes ſaying with thy ſelf, Lord how ſhall I do good with ſo much as I have got by ſuch a bargain. God forbid I ſhould ſay againſt thee, though thou be full of buſineſs from morning to evening. But alaſs, there are many good people and godly, that have hope that they ſerve God, yet if they go home and examine themſelves throughly, their own conſciences will tell them, that in the things of this world, they are not, as if not; but rather, that they have been over-careful, and too full of diſtractions in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>And ſo for matter of joy: if a man have a little pleaſure, or preferment given him; his heart is ſo up, that he knows not where he is, he is ſo tranſported, that he hath clean forgot himſelf. This cannot ſtand, this is not to be, as if not: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeech you in the fear of God think of it.</p>
               <p>Now if a man would know,
<note place="margin">How a man may come to uſe things, as if he uſed them not.</note> how he ſhould come to have his heart in a good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to be in theſe things, as if not. In one word, let me tell you that rule of Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> In all things be filled with the Spirit, and then thou wilt not take thought much for other things: if once you let your ſouls be filled with the things of a better life: then wife, and children, and wealth, and pleaſures, or any thing elſe, will not draw away your heart.</p>
               <p>Get a good hand-faſt of Jeſus Chriſt: work out your ſalvation, and that you may know that you are beleevers upon good grounds, and that you have the graces of the Spirit of God in you, indeed, and in truth, that you are new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>And then often think of the rare things that are provided for you in another life. What; to have God to be your Father, and Angels your keepers, to be children, <pb n="140" facs="tcp:47453:77"/>to be the companions of Angels. Weigh theſe things daily, and then you will be, as if not, in all theſe outward and worldly things. And untill thou doſt this: and thinkeſt withall of that I have formerly ſaid, that thou art ready to ſtrike ſayle, I will never beleeve that thou wilt be, as if not. This is the ſecond thing.</p>
               <p>A word or two of the Third, and ſo I have done. And that is the <hi>Spur</hi> that the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth. And it is neceſſary he ſhould uſe ſuch a ſpur, for it is a very hard leſſon.</p>
               <p>If you would be, as if you were not, conſider this; <hi>The faſſion of the world paſſeth away.</hi> That is, it ſignifieth (I touched it before) ſuch a faſhion as is on a ſtage: All theſe things below, they are but as the Acting of a Comedy, as a Scaene, it may be it is done in half an hour, and though it make a fine ſhew, yet in truth there is no ſubſtance in it.</p>
               <p>There is one,
<note place="margin">3. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Motive or ſpurre.</note> 
                  <hi>it is a faſhion:</hi> beſides, <hi>it paſſeth away.</hi> So then in this ſpur, there are two things. I will but name the heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1. The things of the world but a ſhew without a ſubſtance.</note> 
                  <hi>That the things of the world,</hi> (all that I named before) <hi>are but a ſhew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſubſtance;</hi> Even as a Scaene or Comedy, things that have a glorious glittering ſhew to the eye, but if you look indeed and in truth upon them, there is no ſuch matter. That is one thing that I note, that our life is but as the acting of a part in a Comedy: and ſo by conſequence, in all theſe outward things, thy contentment in wife, or children, or credit, or pleaſures, thou doſt but act a glorious part, it may be thou haſt a goodly outſide, fine clothes, rich apparel, an outward repreſentation of comfort, but look thorow them, and there is no ſuch matter.</p>
               <p>But the ſecond thing which I rather would preſſe,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 2. The ſhew of the world is ſuddenly gone.</note> is, <hi>that it is ſuddenly gone;</hi> it paſſeth away, ſaith the Apoſtle. As a man hath but a little time to tarry in the world, ſo all the things he enjoyeth in the world, are wondrous inconſtant. That look as it is in a Play, he that now acts the part of a King, it may be next, he may act the part of a Begger: or as it is with ſome of your delicate faſhions, that while you are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, the faſhion is ſpoyled. Even ſo, the faſhion of this world it will not continue.</p>
               <p>That is the ſum of that I deſire you to take notice of: that if you will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by me, or by the Spirit of God in his unworthy miniſter, to uſe the things of this world morderately, and carry your ſelves as you ought in croſſes and afflictions: yet know this, that <hi>the faſhion of theſe things</hi> will ſhortly be ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And if they be all ſo unconſtant, what a fool art thou to ſet thy heart upon them?</p>
               <p>We may learne this wiſdome from the foolery of our Engliſh Nation, eſteemed now the idleſt people of the world for changing their faſhion. They will never make clothes twice of one faſhion, but one gown of this faſhion, and another of that, and though he be never ſo good a Taylor that makes it, yet he muſt make no more of the ſame faſhion, but the next Terme, they will come to another. Learn, I ſay, this wiſdome from that foolery: Now, the Lord giveth thee comfort in thy wife, ſet not thy heart too much upon her, the next Term the faſhion may change: Now, thou art rich, let not thy heart dote upon thy riches, it is but a faſhion, a ſhew, it paſſeth away, to morrow thou maiſt be a begger: to day a man, to morrow none.</p>
               <p>But if thou wouldeſt keep the faſhion, get the faſhion of grace, get a right to heaven, an intereſt in God, and be content (in Gods name) to follow his faſhion. If the faſhion that God will have thee be in, be to be an humble dejected man, be content with that faſhion: if anon he will have thee on the topp of the wheel of proſperity, thank God for it, take heed of abuſing the things thou enjoyeſt. Remember the things of this life are inconſtant things; as a flower, as a noſegay, that ſeemeth as a dainty fine thing, but while we are ſmelling at it, and praiſing it, it withereth away; ſo is it with all theſe things.</p>
               <p>I would I could tell how to ſpeak home to your ſouls: and yet I know that little I have ſpoken, if it be entertained with faith, if you beleeve this to be the truth of God, not as the ſpeech that a man makes to you, but as the ſpeech of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:47453:77"/>an Apoſtle of Chriſt, that ſets it down by the direction of God, that it is thus: I ſay, if you lay down this as a truth that comes from God, and ſeriouſly think with your ſelves; I have but a little time to tarry here below, and when I am out of the world, I ſhall live for ever in heaven or in hell: while I do enjoy the things of this world, God will have me to be, as if not, in them: and there is good reaſon why, they are ſhewes, and not ſubſtances: Grace and the favour of God is only that which is ſubſtantial,
<note place="margin">Grace is onely ſubſtantiall.</note> whatſoever you look upon that is under theſe, are but ſhewes: riches, and honour, and worldly contenments they are but ſhadows, like one in a play, that is but a Peaſant under the coat of a King, theſe have but only outſides, under them there is no ſuch matter. This I ſay which I have ſpoken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeriouſly conſidered, and faithfully received, may (through the bleſſing of God, and your own prayers to God to teach you this) be a means to moderate you in the uſe of all thoſe things that are here below.</p>

<note place="margin">The Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (to the end that he might draw thoſe to whom he wrote, from immoderate ſorrow for them that were departed this life:) revealeth to them certain comfortable truths, concerning the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the dead, telling them that death it ſelf is but as a ſleep, whence they ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day, by the voyce of the Arch-angel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Chapter, he prevents an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that ſome might make. For, having fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſcourſe of the Reſurrection, he well knew the curioſity of mans nature, that leaves thoſe things that are moſt profitable, to enquire after ſuch things that God hath hid, and therefore ſome men might ſay; Since there ſhall be ſuch a time, and ſuch a change; when will thoſe times and ſeaſons be? When ſhall that great day of the Reſurrection come, when all ſhall be brought together?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:47453:79"/>
                  <hi>Of the times and ſeaſons brethren</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ye have no need that I write unto you,</hi> verſe 1. As if he ſhould ſay: this is no needful, no neceſſary thing for you to inquire into, or for me to tell you: rather let us fall upon thoſe things that are neceſſary and uſeful; for neither you, not I, can tell the particular time when that ſhall be: yet know this, that very ſuddenly ſuch a time ſhall come, and that when the world leaſt thinks of it.</p>
               <p>The ſuddenneſs hereof, he ſetteth down by a twofold compariſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the coming of a thief in the night: <hi>Your ſelves know perfectly, that the day of the Eord ſo cometh, as a thief in the night,</hi> verſ. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by the travail that cometh upon a woman with child: <hi>When they ſhall ſay, peace, and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape,</hi> This latter, is that I have made choyce of at this time for my Text.</p>
               <p>A little for the explanation of the words;</p>
               <note place="margin">The meaning of the words</note>
               <p>
                  <hi>When they ſhall ſay, peace, and ſafety.</hi> The Apoſtle intendeth not to condemn, either the ſpeaking of <hi>peace</hi> to the children of peace: or their rejoycing in that <hi>peace</hi> they have.
<note place="margin">1. What is meant by peace.</note> But that which he condemneth, is, that they <hi>cry peace</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whom God denounceth war againſt: Men that go on in a courſe of ſinning, and in ſecurity: and yet will perſwade themſelves, that all ſhall be well with them in the end; theſe are the men upon whom Death ſhall come thus ſuddenly, and upon whom the Judgment day ſhall come thus unexpected. <hi>When they ſhall ſay, peace, and ſafety;</hi> that is, when they are living in their ſins, walking on in their rebellions againſt God, and ſhall yet be flattering themſelves, that it ſhall be well with them not withſtanding this, then ſhall Judgment come upon them, then <hi>ſudden deſtruction</hi> cometh.</p>
               <p>By <hi>deſtruction</hi> here,
<note place="margin">2. What by deſtruction.</note> he meaneth not, the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the body or the ſoul, the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of their beeing. For the Soul even after the death of the body ſhall have a beeing: and the body alſo ſhall be reſtored again to its beeing and parts, in the reſurrection from the dead,</p>
               <p>It were happy for wicked and ungodly men, if there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>deſtruction</hi> of there beeing, as that they ſhould ceaſe to be any more: for then this body, the members whereof have been the ſervants of ſin, ſhould not be tormented in Hell: and then this Soul of theirs, that hath ſet all the body on work in the ſervice of ſin, it ſhould not be ſenſible of that anguiſh that ſhall cauſe <hi>gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> It were well (I ſay) for them if there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>deſtruction:</hi> it is that which if they might have their deſire, they would wiſh above all things in the world. But it will not be ſuch a <hi>deſtruction,</hi> it ſhall be worſe with them. It ſhall only be the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of their joy, and comfort, of all their contentments, of all thoſe things wherein they ſolaced, and flattered themſelves upon earth: all theſe things ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Their riches that fed their luſts ſhall be deſtroyed: and their company that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them in ſin, ſhall be deſtroyed: and all things wherein they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted themſelves here upon earth, ſhall be deſtroyed: the <hi>whole earth ſhall be burnt with fire</hi> before them. And beſide this, that ſame chearfulneſs of ſpirit, and that free diſpoſition, whereby they incouraged themſelves in the wayes of their pride, or whatſoever elſe it was, that made them ſeem ſome body on earth; all this ſhall ceaſe and fail them, and forſake them. There ſhall be no mirth, no wiſdom, no courage, no friends, no wealth, no houſes, no apparrel, nothing to pride and delight themſelves in, there ſhall be an utter <hi>deſtruction</hi> of all theſe things. <hi>Then ſhall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction come upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As pain upon a woman with child.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The manner of the deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, 1. Sudden.</note> This ſheweth the manner, the kind of their <hi>deſtruction that ſhall come upon them.</hi> It ſhall be firſt, <hi>a ſudden deſtruction:</hi> it ſhall not give them warning, either of the time or place: as it falleth out with a woman with child, her travel may come upon her, in the ſtreet, at the table, when ſhe is talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So ſhall <hi>deſtructiou come ſuddenly upon them,</hi> they ſhall have no more warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then theſe general warnings,
<note place="margin">2. Painful.</note> that they have in the preaching of the Word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſhall be a painful <hi>deſtruction,</hi> full of miſery and ſorrow, as travail on a woman with child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:47453:79"/>And then thirdly;
<note place="margin">3. Unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> It ſhall be an <hi>inevitable deſtruction,</hi> ſuch a deſtruction as they ſhall never avoid. All their wit, friends, power, ſtrength, wealth, or whatſoever elſe they have, cannot put off the ſtroke of Judgment that ſhall come upon them: as all the devices a woman hath, cannot make her eſcape her travail, when it cometh.</p>
               <p>So then the meaning of the words are, as if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid; When wicked and ungodly men, in a courſe of ſin ſhall <hi>crie peace to themſelves,</hi> and flatter themſelves in their rebellious courſes, then ſhall a <hi>ſudden, a painful, an inevitable deſtruction,</hi> of all their comfort, of all their props, and hopes, and helps, fall upon them.</p>
               <p>In the words, you have a twofold deſcription.</p>
               <note place="margin">In the words a double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</note>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt of the ſtate and condition of the men of the world, when Chriſt ſhall come to Judgment.</hi> He ſhall find all the world at reſt.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, here is the conſequent that followeth upon the vain flattery of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: <hi>Then ſhall deſtruction come upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that deſtruction is farther deſcribed and amplified by a compariſon taken from a <hi>woman with child,</hi> to declare the <hi>ſuddainneſs,</hi> the <hi>painfulneſs,</hi> the <hi>unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dableneſs</hi> of it. Thus you have the opening of the words.</p>
               <p>Let us now come to the points of inſtruction that may be raiſed hence.</p>
               <p>Firſt, here you may ſee, and he that runs may read it, that,<lb/>

               <p>This is the very thing that the holy Ghoſt would have us to take notice of here: <hi>At that very time,</hi> not before that time, <hi>they ſhall crie peace:</hi> Nor after the time when they had done it, and repented of it: But juſt at the very time, when they are in the middeſt of their ſins, applauding of their own eſtate, living under the power and guilt of ſin, then <hi>cometh the deſtruction upon them, and they ſhall not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape.</hi> Thus far the text.</p>
               <p>That we may make the point clear, before we come to prove it, give me leave, firſt briefly to tell you what we mean by that ſecurity, which is upon men even in their chiefeſt dangers.</p>
               <p>Know therefore,
<note place="margin">A double ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> that there is a twoford ſecurity,</p>
               <list>

               </list>
               <p>There is firſt,
<note place="margin">1. Holy and ſpiritual.</note> a holy and ſpiritual ſecurity (and that even in this ſtate where into we are fallen) which conſiſteth in a mans reconciliation with God, when he is in termes of peace with him, having obtained remiſſion of his ſins, and his favour through Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that God is pleaſed with him in his Son, hath received him into the Covenant of grace, intereſted him into all the promiſes, and is become his God by a Covenant for ever. Now here a man may be ſecure, yea, and he muſt be ſo in a ſpirituall manner. Confidence upon the goodneſs of God in Chriſt, upon the promiſes of God in the Goſpel, is that which is requiſite in every Chriiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: it is that which God commandeth; <hi>Fear not</hi> (ſaith he in one place.) And again, <hi>Truſt in the Lord.</hi> The Scripture is full in a calling for ſuch ſecurity as this; that men ſhould lay aſide all thoſe carking, and diſtracting cares when once they are in the Covenant of Grace, that now they ſhould mind nothing but duty, and not be troubled about ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:47453:80"/>For (my brethren) it is ſuch a ſecurity as makes a man not to neglect duty;
<note place="margin">Spiritual ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, what.</note> but ſuch, as freeth a man from thoſe diſquiets of ſoul about the event of things.</p>
               <p>This was that which <hi>David</hi> had,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.8.</note> and rejoyced in; <hi>I laid me down in reſt and peace, for the Lord keepeth me in ſafety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that which the Lord commanded the people of Iſrael to doe;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 26.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Come my people, enter thou into thy chamber, and ſhut thy doors about thee, hide thy ſelf, &amp;c.</hi> He would have them ſecure themſelves under his protection, and in his ordinances.</p>
               <p>This is ſuch a ſecurity, as draweth men neerer to God, bringeth them to further acquaintance with God, keepeth them in a conſtant communion with God, cauſeth them to walk in Gods preſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is a good ſecurity.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly,
<note place="margin">2. Sinful and carnal.</note> there is a ſinful carnal ſecurity; that is, when a man yet living in a courſe of ſin, he beareth up his ſpirit againſt all fear, either of judgments threatned, or judgments approaching upon him, under a vain hope, of I know not what mercy in God: and of I know not what aſſurance from men, and upon worldly conceits and flatteries, either from others, or his own heart. Here is now a ſinful carnal ſecurity, not warranted, but condemned in the word of God. This is the ſecurity, that is ever an ill prognoſticator, and fore-runner of ſome heavy judgment, to fall upon that perſon in whom it is. This is the ſecurity that we have now in chaſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt then,
<note place="margin">Carnal ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> we will make it appear, that it is an infallible ſign, of Gods Judgment upon a perſon, or a people, to cry peace to themſelves, to be ſecure, and no way troubled at their eſtate, when God is at war with them.</p>
               <p>You ſhall ſee this in inſtances and examples.</p>
               <note place="margin">Proved.</note>
               <p>See it in particular perſons,
<note place="margin">1. By particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examples of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> and in States and Kingdoms; and you ſhall generally find it, that before the deſtroying judgment came upon them, they have been given up to this ſecurity we ſpeak of, this <hi>crying of peace</hi> upon a falſe ground.</p>
               <p>See it in <hi>Agag,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.13.</note> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.13. <hi>The bitterneſs of death is paſt.</hi> But was it paſt? Nay, at that very time, the bitterneſs of death was upon him, for the very next thing that we meet withall in the Story is, that <hi>Agag was hewen in pieces before the Lord in Gilgall.</hi>

               <p>Ye have <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.
<note place="margin">Dan. 5.3.</note> wondrous ſecure, carrowſing, and <hi>quaffing in the holy veſſels that were taken out of the Temple of the houſe of God which was at Jeruſalem, amongſt his Princes and Nobles, his Wives and his Concubines,</hi> as if there would be no change of his eſtate, and tranſlation of his Empire. But what? was it ſo? Nay, at that very time, <hi>the very ſame hour</hi> (faith the text, verſe 5.) <hi>came forth fingers of a mans hand, and wrote upon the plaiſter of the wall of the Kings Pallace, Mene, Mene, Tekell, Upharſin. Thou art laid in the ballance, and art found too light, thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> and immediatly, <hi>In that very night</hi> (verſ. 30.) <hi>was Belſhazzer King of the Caldeans ſlain;</hi> he was took away from all his comfort and jollity.</p>
               <p>See this in the Rich man,
<note place="margin">Luke 12.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. <hi>Soul, ſoul</hi> (faith he) <hi>take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry:</hi> and why ſo? was it becauſe his ſonl indeed was waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bloud of Chriſt? Nothing leſs. But, <hi>take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many years,</hi> thou art well provided againſt a hard Winter, againſt a dear year, now <hi>take thine eaſe.</hi> Well, what of this? had his ſoul any whit the more eaſe? had he many years to enjoy that which he had laid up for many years? Nay, mark the anſwer of God (verſe 20.) <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be taken from thee; then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be, that thou haſt provided?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ordinary (as <hi>Job</hi> noteth of worldly men) thus to flatter themſelves:
<note place="margin">Job. 21.13.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſpend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</hi> They ſpend their dayes in wealth: this is that they reſolve upon while they live upon earth, they will be merry, and enjoy their wealth, and worldly contentments to the height, and want nothing, but in a moment, while they are in the middeſt of theſe thoughts of raiſing a happineſs to themſelves out of their worldly eſtate, in the middeſt of theſe thoughts they go down to the grave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:47453:80"/>So it is alſo in Nations and States.
<note place="margin">2. By general examples of Nations and States. Luke 7.</note> See it in two particulars in the 17. <hi>Luke.</hi> That of the old world; That of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah; They were eating and drinking, and building, and planting, and marrying, and giving in marriage, till the flood came upon the one, and fire and brimſtone upon the other, till ſudden deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction came upon both,</hi> according to my Text.</p>
               <p>Yee ſhall have Jeruſalem in the ſame caſe. Their Prophets are flattering them and crying peace,
<note place="margin">Jer. 6.14, 15.</note> peace, as <hi>Jeremy</hi> tells them, Chap. 6.14, 15. <hi>They heal the hurt of the daughter of my people ſlightly, ſaying peace, peace, when there is no peace. Were they aſhamed when they had committed abomination? Nay, they were not aſhamed, neither could they bluſh; therefore they ſhall fall among men that fall at the time that I viſit them, they ſhall be caſt down, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Mark the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets cry peace; It had been well done of the Prophets to cry peace to thoſe Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, that in truth were at peace with God: but they cry peace to them, to whom there was no peace. What then? Did the people reform? did this make thoſe that before were rebellious againſt God, come in and accept of the conditions of peace, and forſake their ſins, and turn to God? No ſuch matter, nay though their ſins were reproved by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and other faithful Prophets, <hi>yet they were not aſhamed, when they had committed abomination, and they could not bluſh;</hi> they ſtood it out, they remained in their impenitency. Well, what of this? <hi>Therefore</hi> (faith the Lord) <hi>they ſhall fall amongſt them that fall, in that day, at that time, they ſhall be doſtroyed, they ſhall be caſt down,</hi> they ſhall ceaſe to be a people; at leaſt, they ſhall ceaſe to be men prevailing above other people.</p>
               <p>In the firſt of <hi>Zephaniah.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeph. 1.12.</note> verſ. 12. ye have the Lord ſaying there, that <hi>he will viſit Jeruſalem with lights, and ſearch it with candles.</hi> What to do? <hi>to find out the men that are frozen on their dreggs, that are ſettled on their lees; that ſay in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</hi> Why will the Lord viſit <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with lights, to find out theſe men? He meeteth with the conceit, that ſuch men as theſe have, they think (as the Athieſts in <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>that God is circled in the clouds,</hi> and ſeeth not the things below, or as thoſe in this Propheſie of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany,</hi> that ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſees not, neither doth he regard.</hi> Why doth he not ſo? Becauſe he wants light. Well then (faith the Lord) I will bring candles to ſee with, and viſit <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with lights: and whoſoever he ſpies out amongſt all the ſinners in Iſrael, he will be ſure to meet with thoſe that ſay, <hi>The Lord ſees not; that are ſettled on their dreggs,</hi> that ſecure themſelves under falſe perſwaſions, they ſhall not eſcape his wrath; Gods greateſt quarrel is againſt thoſe men that flatter themſelves, as if God did not take notice of their ſins, he will ſurely puniſh thoſe: it is for their ſakes, why he will bring candles to ſearch <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with.</p>
               <p>It was ſo with <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 47.8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.8, 9. The Lord obſerveth her boaſting; <hi>I am</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>a Queen, I ſit as a Lady, I ſhall neither ſee loſs of children nor wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood.</hi> Mark now what God ſaith, <hi>Heare now this, thou that art given to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and dwelleſt careleſly, both theſe ſhall come upon thee, loſs of children, and widdowhood;</hi> all thy props, and all thy ſtaies ſhall be taken from thee, yea, and that in one day, in a moment, when thou leaſt thinkeſt of it, ſuddenly thou ſhalt be husbandleſs, and childleſs.</p>
               <p>Nay,
<note place="margin">Rev. 18.7.</note> it is that which the Lord ſpeaks of Romiſh Babylon in the 18. <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. She had heard of the pride and boaſting of old <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſhe would fain be like it: <hi>I ſit as a Queen</hi> (ſaith ſhe too) <hi>and am no widdow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow:</hi> ſhe ſtands upon her outward pompe and glory, as worldly-minded men do (ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they come to greatneſs and eminency.) Well, what will the Lord do? <hi>Therefore</hi> (verſe 8.) <hi>ſhall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine, and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire, for ſtrong is the Lord God who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her.</hi> Thou ſaiſt I ſit as a Lady, I ſhall ſee no change. Well ſaith the Lord, it ſhall be indeed a famous Church for ſomething, even for ſuch judgements as ſhall fall upon it, above all other places: there ſhall be famine, and death, and burning: Yea, and it ſhall be done, when all outward means that ſhould bring this to paſs, ſeem to fail, and when <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall ſeem to advance her ſelf like a <hi>Queen</hi> above all other Churches, when there is nothing but ſtrength, and might <pb n="148" facs="tcp:47453:81"/>on her ſide, then ſhall God do it, <hi>for ſtrong is the Lord that judgeth her.</hi> He bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this (<hi>ſtrong is the Lord</hi>) to anſwer an objection. It ſhall be done for the Church, even then when the advers party thriveth moſt: then when it may be ſeen to be Gods own work: then when men are taken off from ſelf-confidence: then when men have none to fix their eyes on, but God, then will God do this for his Church. He ſaith plainly, that <hi>Babylon ſhall be burnt with fire,</hi> and at ſuch a time, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that it cannot be done, except he put his ſtrength to the work. Thus ye ſee the ſecurity of a people or Nation, or Kingdom, it is an infallible ſign of judgement fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon it,</p>
               <p>And is muſt be ſo,
<note place="margin">Confirmed by Reaſon.</note> and there is great reaſon for it. If we either conſider the cauſes of ſecurity, whence it cometh: or the concommitants that accompany it; or the fruits and events of it: it muſt be that great judgements muſt befall men, and places, when they are under this carnal ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Firſt look to the cauſes.
<note place="margin">1. In reſpect of the cauſes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Infidellty.</note> Whence is it that men, that are not at peace with God, yet flatter themſelves that they ſhall do well? It proceedeth from that unbelief, and infidelity, that is in the hearts of men: therefore they flatter themſelves; and pride themſelves in things that will not hold them up in the end: I ſay infidelity is the cauſe that men are ſo ſecure.</p>
               <p>Did men beleeve the word of God, that every threatning that goeth out of the mouth of God, againſt any particular ſin, ſhould certainly fall upon the head of the ſinner, durſt they go on in a courſe of ſinning againſt God? Durſt they add drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs to thirſt? one wickedneſs to another? No certainly. In that meaſure a man hath faith; in that meaſure he feareth God and his judgements that he hath threatned.</p>
               <p>See it in <hi>Noah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> Heb. 11. <hi>By faith Noah being warned of God, moved with fear, prepared an Ark.</hi> He beleeved the word of God was faithful, that had threatned a judgement upon the world: he beleeved the word of God, that commanded him to provide an Ark for the ſafety of him and his houſe, and therefore he feared the Deluge to come, and prepared an Ark.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe <hi>Joſiah,</hi> when he read the book of the Law, and ſaw what was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the ſins of the people, <hi>his heart melted within him:</hi> and why? becauſe he beleeved that this was the word of God, he beleeved that God would be as true as his Word, therefore his heart melted within him, at the ſight of thoſe ſins, wherein the people had continued ſo long a time.</p>
               <p>Nay,
<note place="margin">Iſa 61.</note> it is made a diſcription of a beleever in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. <hi>That he is one that trembleth at Gods word.</hi> On the other ſide: what is the reaſon why infidelity doth preſently bring judgements upon men? The cauſe is apparant: infidelity it draweth men from God;
<note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>An unbeleeving heart departs from the living God.</hi> And when a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from Gods preſence, God purſueth him with his judgments. All the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are upon that place, where Gods preſence in his graces is not. <hi>If I go</hi> (faith <hi>David to the uttermoſt parts of the earth, thou art there: if I go into the deep, thou art there.</hi> And how there? Not only as an obſerver, but as a puniſher; that is, when men come to this point, to flie from God: Now, unbeleef is a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſoul from God to the creature, therefore it provokes God, for it ſets up an Idol in the heart of man, and Idolatry exceedingly provokes God, and therefore he bringeth judgements upon it.</p>
               <p>Beſide that,
<note place="margin">Deut. 29.19.</note> marke the threatning of the word againſt this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>When a man heareth the words of this curſe, and bleſſeth himſelf, and ſaith, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the ſtubbornneſs of my own heart, the Lord will not ſpare that man, but the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt him, and all the plagues that are written in this book, ſhall be heaped on him.</hi> When is that? when is the time that the wrath of God ſhall ſmoak? At that very time and inſtant, when he flattereth himſelf with his vain conceits, that he ſhall have peace though God threaten judgement, then at that very inſtant, the wrath of God ſhall fall upon ſuch a man.</p>
               <p>In this manner did God deal with the Iſraelites,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 6: 9, 10.</note> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, make their ears heavy:</hi> and why ſo? <hi>that they may ſee, and not</hi> 
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:47453:81"/>
                  <hi>perceive; that they may hear, and not underſtand; leſt they ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them. How long ſhall this be?</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>till the Cities be waſted without inhabitant, and the houſes without man, and the land be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſolate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When God giveth over a people to be regardleſs in hearing the Word, that they hear and do not hear ken, they hear and do not regard, they do not comforme and reform, according to the doctrine delivered, then God intendeth to ſweep them away by judgement, that they may be utterly left deſolate, as the Text ſaith.</p>
               <p>You ſee then it muſt needs be a grievous fore-runner of a judgement upon a place, or City, or people, or nation, when they remain impenitent in their ſins, and yet cry peace.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly;
<note place="margin">2. In reſpect of the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> If you marke the concommitants, what accompanies that carnal ſecurity in the heart of men, and it will appear then, that it muſt of neceſſity bring a judgement upon a Land and place. What is that that accompanies it? A diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſlighting of God himſelf. When a man, I ſay, heareth the Word, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned: heareth the Law warning him to take heed of wrath: the Goſpel alluring him to repent: and yet all moveth him not, but ſtill he flattereth himſelf: I ſay here is a diſpoſition ſlighting God himſelf.</p>
               <p>God in all his Attributes is ſlighted.
<note place="margin">Diſreſpect of God in all his Attributes.</note> His power, his wiſdom, his juſtice, his truth is ſlighted: yea, his mercy, and patience, and long-ſuffering, all are ſlighted, when a man in the courſe of ſin goeth on in carnal ſecurity. Eſpecially amongſt the reſt, this is a ſlighting of Gods patience, and long-ſuffering, and forbearance of men.</p>
               <p>Wherefore do men harden themſelves againſt exhortation to repentance, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they preſume upon the continuance of Gods long-ſuffering toward them? Mark how the Lord takes notice of this,
<note place="margin">Rom: 2: 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>The forbearance, and long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, the goodneſs, and mercy of God, ſhould lead thee to repentance;</hi> and therefore God hath forbore thee all this while, that he might bring thee to repentance. But what if he do not? <hi>Thou after thy hardneſs, and impenitent heart, heapeſt up as a treaſure to thy ſelf, wrath againſt the day if wrath.</hi> What day is that? <hi>The day of the revelation of the righteous judgement of God.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; Now you obſcure Gods juſtice and righteouſneſs from others, and from your ſelves: Well, God therefore will take a time to declare his righteous judgement, for that purpoſe God hath a day of wrath; and thy daily going on in ſin, againſt the long-ſuffering, and patience of God, it doth but add wrath to that day. Thus it is when God hath borne with a man his own ſelf.</p>
               <p>So it is likewiſe when God warneth a man by his patience toward others. What hardneth men in ſecurity? Do we not ſee God hath been merciful to many ſinners, why may he not be ſo to me too? He gave them repentance after many ſins commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, why may he not do ſo to me?</p>
               <p>Mark what <hi>Solomon</hi> faith,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ: 8: 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil doer, or an evil work, is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſons of men, is ſet in them to do evil.</hi> This they purpoſe, they reſolve upon, they venture upon: God hath been thus and thus to others, patient and long-ſuffering, and why may he not be ſo to them? <hi>Well yet I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>that it ſhall not go well with them in the end, neither ſhall the wicked prolong his dayes;</hi> Why? <hi>becauſe he feareth not before God.</hi> They are not awakned by the example of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on others, they are not allured by his patience and long-ſuffering: it doth not make them to fear him: therefore it ſhall not go well with them in the end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3: In reſpect of the fruit and conſequences of ſecurity.</note> Look to the end, what the conſequence of this carnal ſecurity is, what followes upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. Where there is carnal ſecurity, there muſt of neceſſity be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of ſin, and conſequently, a haſtening of judgement: for the more ſin haſtneth to ripeneſs, the more judgment haſtneth alſo upon the ſinner. God hath ſet unto particular men a certain ſtint,
<note place="margin">Gen: 15: 16.</note> and it is not known to them, what that ſtint limited is. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. <hi>The iniquity of the Amorites, is not yet full.</hi> They were a ſinful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <pb n="150" facs="tcp:47453:82"/>at that time: but the neerer they came to the fulneſs, and ſtint, and limitation that God intended to be the immeditate fore-runner of the judgement, the faſter judgement haſtneth upon them. So for particular perſons, there is a certaine ſtint limited (Let every man look to it.)
<note place="margin">Note.</note> The adding of one ſin more, may by thy utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtint, that ſhall bring the laſt ſtroke of judgement, and deſtruction upon thee. Now (I ſay) this carnal ſecurity is that, that increaſeth ſin upon a man. We know how the ſecurity of the Iſraelites increaſed their ſin upon them. And the ſecurity of <hi>Sodome, their pride, and idleneſs,</hi> increaſed the reſt of their ſins, and conſequently haſtned on their judgement. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. when <hi>there was no fear of God before their eyes;</hi> when there was a neglect of that, there was abundance of wickedneſs amongſt them: and what follows? <hi>then their was nothing but deſtruction, and calamity in all their ways.</hi> I could give you ſundry inſtances of this in the word of God. But I haſten.</p>
               <p>You ſee the reaſon. Let us now come to make ſome uſe of it, that we may not be prevented.</p>
               <p>We have told you, that it is true of States and Kingdoms, of particular perſons, of every man,
<note place="margin">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that when in a courſe of ſin, and impenitency, they cry peace to themſelves, then judgement and deſtruction is comming upon them. It ſerveth therefore to inform us, what to think of our ſelves, of the eſtate of this Land wherein we live: of theſe times wherein we are fallen.</p>
               <p>What can we expect, when we conſider to what a height of ſin we are come; how impenitent men are: how obſtinate and hard-hearted, and ſtiff-necked againſt the voyce of God in the Goſpel, and the means of Grace; but deſtruction to come upon us?</p>
               <p>If we look upon the ſins of men, we may perceive even a general ripeneſſe for judgement. When the ſins of the <hi>Amorites</hi> were full, judgement came upon them. How near the ſins of this Land are come to that fulneſs, we know not, we have cauſe to fear. We ſee in other Countries the ſhaking of the ſword upon us: it hath not yet awakened us to fear God. At home, we have had the voyce of the Prophets, the Miniſters crying unto us from day to day, to return, leſt deſtruction come upon us: it hath not brought us to return from our ſins. We have ſeen the mercies of God upon particular perſons, and families: it hath not awakened men to walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionably in their places. We ſee no reformation, there is rather an increaſe of ſin. And what can we expect there wants? but one ſin, and when that is come, ſudden deſtruction cometh. What is that? Security.</p>
               <p>And have we not cauſe to bewail the general ſecurity that is amongſt us? May not the <hi>Angel of the Lord</hi> return that anſwer, as he did in the firſt of <hi>Zecha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>; All the world is at reſt?</hi> Go in to the ſtreets, the houſes, the ſhops of men, every man is at reſt: no man is troubled about his eſtate, nor affected with Gods diſpleaſure, either againſt himſelf, or the Land we live in. See, is not the Land as ſecure as they of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> or worſe? They were ſecure, becauſe they did not here of the danger; of the purpoſe of the Danites againſt them: therefore their ſecurity was not altogether ſo culpable and blame-worthy. But I will tell you what ſecurity ours is: nay, the holy Ghoſt hath told us to our hands, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.34. That judgement there, that is threatned againſt a man that goeth on in ſin, ſeems to be a judgement executed upon us at this time: <hi>Thou ſhalt be as a man that lies down in the middeſt of the ſea, or as he that lies upon the top of a maſt. They have ſtriken me, ſhalt thou ſay, and I was not ſick: they have beaten me, and I felt it not, when I awake, I will ſeek it yet again.</hi> Our ſecurity, I ſay, is like that of <hi>a man in the middeſt of the ſea,</hi> and yet aſleep: <hi>as a man upon the top of a maſt,</hi> and yet aſleep. Nay, men not only in danger, out ſuch as have the ſtroke upon them: <hi>They have ſtruken me, and I was not ſick; they have wounded me, and I felt it not.</hi> Is it not thus with us, in theſe dead and ſecure times that we live in? And ſhall we ſay that we are not aſleep? Hath not the Lord ſent the deſtroying Angel amongſt us, that hath ſmitten thouſands in our ſtreets? and yet we have not felt it. Shall we ſay we are not in danger? <hi>We are as a man that ſleepeth on the top of a maſt</hi> at Sea: Nay, as a man in the middeſt of the waves, in a dead ſleep, like ſuch as are drunk, and yet we feel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Truly we have little cauſe to be ſecure, we have little cauſe to flatter our <pb n="151" facs="tcp:47453:82"/>ſelves with vain conceits of peace, and continuance of proſperity, if we look well about us. Where is any man that takes occaſion by what he hears abroad, or ſees at home, to enter into the reformation of his own houſe, of his own heart?</p>
               <p>It may be ſome men will ſay; It is an unjuſt tax that you put upon us; we are not ſo ſecure as you ſpeak of. You ſhall ſcarſe come to any mans table, but they will be talking of the jndgments abroad. You ſhall ſcarſe meet a man in the ſtreets, but he will leave other occaſions, and tell you how ill it goes with the Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas. You ſhall ſcarſe meet with one in the field, but all the time is took up with diſcourſe of the evils at home, or troubles abroad. And is this a ſign of ſecurity?</p>
               <p>Alas (beloved) this is to be aſleep, in the middeſt of the waves. Every man is in the middeſt of danger, and yet is ſecure.</p>
               <p>How ſhall that appear?</p>
               <p>I will make it appear, by demonſtrations and ſigns, that may convince you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, that we add this to the reſt of our ſins, that in the middeſt of our ſins and impenitency, we are ſecure: and therefore that deſtruction is coming upon us.</p>
               <p>What are the ſigns whereby we may be convinced of ſecurity?</p>
               <p>I will give you a few,
<note place="margin">Signs of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> that by thoſe you may ſee whether the Land, the City, your families, your ſelves, and all be not aſleep, and at reſt this day.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſign ſhall be this;
<note place="margin">1. Profiting not by the judgments of God on our ſelves, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> When men profit not by the judgements of God. Certainly it is an evident ſign of a deep ſleep in ſin, when neither the afflictions that are upon others, or upon our ſelves, do any good upon us.</p>
               <p>Look how God hath ſmitten others. Hath that awakned us? You will ſay that it is a ſecure child that ſeeth his brother beaten, for the ſame fault before his eyes, and yet goeth on in it; you will ſay that that is a ſecure malefactor, that ſeeth ſuch a perſon executed before his face, and yet goeth on in the ſame fellony and theſt. And muſt we not ſay that we are a ſecure generation, when we can ſee our brethren in other Countries, how they have ſuffered, and yet go on in the very ſame fins, that we our ſelves think the hand of God is upon them for? We can talk of their ſins, of their unrighteouſneſs, and in juſtice, we can talk of their neglect of the Lords day, and other holy duties, and for theſe we judge them ſmitten of God. How is it then that we are ſuch our ſelves? how is it, that we go on in unrighteouſneſs, in prophaning the Lords day, in neglecting the houſe of God, and our own families? have they found ſuch ſweetneſs in theſe ſins, that we walk on in the ſame? Is it a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and comfortable thing to be driven from Gods houſe, and from our own houſes? to be a reproach to all the world? If we think that the hand of God is upon them for theſe ſins, how is it that we are not awaked? I remember <hi>Daniel</hi> in the fifth Chapter of his Propheſie,
<note place="margin">Dan. 5.</note> taxeth <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> for this: <hi>though thou knoweſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how the hand of God was upon thy father, for this, and this, yet thou haſt done the like, and haſt not humbled thy heart.</hi> So may I ſay; You have kown what God hath done to your brethren in other Countries, yet you do ſtill the ſame your ſelves, for the which they have been puniſhed. Is not this ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
               <p>Look likewiſe upon our ſelves, and we ſhall ſee a general neglect of thoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, that have been upon our ſelves. How hath God ſmitten this Land? this Citie eipecially, with the Peſtilence? and may we not ſay, we have been ſmitten, and yet have not felt it? is not this ſecurity, and a dead ſleep? God threatneth thoſe in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.9.
<note place="margin">Ier. 31.9.</note> 
                  <hi>That eſcaped the peſtilence, that they ſhould fall by the ſword, by the hand of Nebuchadnezar:</hi> Why ſo? becauſe they did not reforme, and amend by the peſtilence. What cauſe have we then to fear, leſt we fall into the hands of the ſword of ſome <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> or other, when the peſtilence hath done no more good amongſt us, when it hath not awakened, &amp; reformed us? Look upon our ſelves, upon your houſes, upon your dealings, your company, your converſations; ſee if there be any reformation, ſince there was ſuch a mortal calamity, as drove you from <pb n="152" facs="tcp:47453:83"/>the Citie, and frighted you from your own houſes, and from the houſe of God.</p>
               <p>Well: theſe are fearful preſages, that when former Judgements prevail not, worſer are a coming.
<note place="margin">Amos 4.</note> 
                  <hi>I have ſmitten them</hi> (ſaith God in the fourth of <hi>Amos</hi>) <hi>with cleanneſs of teeth, and yet they have not returned unto me:</hi> What then? <hi>I have ſmitten them with blaſting and mildew, and yet they have not returned unto me:</hi> What then? <hi>I have ſmitten them with the peſtilence, after the manner of Egypt, and yet they have not returned unto me:</hi> What then? <hi>Therefore I will come againſt them; and becauſe I will do this, prepare to meet thy God, Oh Iſrael.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; I have now ſtood out, and tryed you, at one or two weapons, and found you obſtinate and rebellious: I have ſtroke at you with the ſword of Famin; I have ſhot at you the Arrows of peſtilence; I have ſmitten you with other judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. You ſhould now meet me; if not, I have more weapons yet; I will come and bid the battel againſt you, and it ſhall appear who is the ſtronger, you or I: And ſince you will ſtand out againſt me, notwithſtanding the Judgements executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, and afflictions upon your ſelves, ſee if you can ſtand out againſt my laſt ſtroke: you have eſcaped ſome leſſer ſickneſſes upon your own bodies; you have eſcaped the Peſtilence already; but you ſhall find it a hard taske, when God bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth battel, to eſcape his laſt ſtroke, if you will not now be reconciled, and come in, and ſeek his face. This is the firſt demonſtration, whereby it appears, that we are ſinfully ſecure, which is a fore-runner of Judgement, becauſe we are not awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Judgements of God upon our ſelves and others.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Contempt of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> another ſign is this; The contempt of Gods ordinances: the ſlighting of the Prophets. This is an evident demonſtration that we are under this carnal ſecurity I now ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>Mark how the Lord deſcribeth a people whom he meaneth to deſtroy, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.11, 12. <hi>They refuſed to hearken, and pulled away the ſhoulder, and ſtopped their ears, that they ſhould not hear: Yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant ſtone, leſt they ſhould hear the Law, and the words which the Lord of hoſts hath ſent in his ſpirit by the former Prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the Lord of hoſts.</hi> A great wrath, what is that? <hi>Therefore</hi> (verſ. 13.) <hi>it is come to paſſe, that as He cryed, and they would not hear, ſo they cryed, and I would not here, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well (beloved) little do you know what time, and wayes God hath to make you cry, and roar in the anguiſh of your hearts, becauſe of Judgements and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, when you will not now hear God, that ſtriveth with you, and cries unto you with the voyce of his Spirit in his Prophets from day to day. When men will not hear God ſpeaking to them in his Word, it is alwayes a fore-runner of judgement. In the ſixth of <hi>Amos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 6.</note> the Lord challengeth his people, and telleth them, that he had uſed many means for their reclaiming, but nothing would do them good: well now (ſaith he) <hi>hear the rod, and him that hath appointed it:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: there is no more dealing with you with the Word, but I muſt come with the rod, with judgement. Is it not thus with us at this day? May not the Lord ſay of us, as he did of the people in <hi>Jeremies</hi> time?
<note place="margin">Ier. 9.13.</note> 
                  <hi>You have forſaken my law which I ſet before you, and have not obeyed my voyce, neither walked therein, but have walked after the imaginations of your own heart.</hi> And then what follows? <hi>Therefore, thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Behold, I will feed this people with Wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink, and I will ſend a ſword after them, till I have conſumed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do not many cry out, as they in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.33. <hi>What is the burthen of the Lord?</hi> Where is it that the Miniſters have not been threatning judgement,
<note place="margin">Ier. 23.33.</note> and telling you that God is coming out to be avenged upon a ſinful nation? have they not been crying thus, this ſeven, ten, twenty years? Where is that burthen of the Lord? Well, you ſhall find what it is, when the day of the Lord cometh, a day of blackneſs and terrour: it haſteneth: and this very ſecurity is an evident ſign thereof: even as in the dayes of <hi>Noah, that Preacher of righteouſneſs:</hi> and in the dayes of <hi>Lot, that vexed his ſoul with the unclean converſation of the Sodomites;</hi> they would not beleeve their words, but <hi>they ſeemed unto them, as if they mocked;</hi> and then came the judgment of the Lord upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:47453:83"/>If this be not the eſtate of this Land at this day, what means the complaints, the heavineſs of the ſpirits of the Prophets? What means their tears and cries, and prayers, becauſe of the obſtinacy, and hard-heartedneſs of people that will not be drawn from their ſins by any means? This is a ſecond evidence or ſign, when all this crying and calling will not awaken, that we are in a deep ſleep of ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. Vain conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> another evidence is, the vain hopes of this Land. It is a ſigne of carnal ſecurity, and that we are all in a dead ſleep, when we have ſuch idle dreams out of idle fancies, and vain confidence that delude and deceive men.</p>
               <p>What do men reſt on, to ſecure, and perſwade themſelves of immunity from wrath and impunity?</p>
               <p>Certainly this, that we have the ordinances of God amongſt us. Oh the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Alas, had not the people of Iſrael the Ark? and yet the Philiſtims took the Ark, and ſlew the ſons of <hi>Eli.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 7.11.12.13.</note> Had they not the Temple? and yet the Lord in <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Sendeth them to Shiloh. Go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I ſet my name at the firſt, and ſee what I did to it, for the wickedneſs of my people Iſrael. And now becauſe you have done all theſe works, ſaith the Lord, and I ſpake unto you riſing early, and ſpeaking, but you heard not; and I called unto you, but you anſwered not. Therefore will I do to this houſe, which is called by my name, wherein you truſt, as I have done to Shiloh.</hi> Had not the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> the golden Candleſtick? and yet are they not now tributary to the Turk? The ordinances of God (beloved) are means to increaſe, and haſten a judgment, when we ſhut our eyes, and will not open them, but walk in darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Oh but there was never ſo many Preachers, nor ſo many means: there ſeems to be a new ſpring of the Goſpel: there are abundance of men that come daily furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Miniſtery, and are zealous and forward, and powerful Prophets, and the like: and therefore it is a ſign that much good is intended towards us, and that no judgment ſhall come.</p>
               <p>But do we not read that immediatly before the ſeventy years captivity, there were more Prophets then in many years before? Why ſhould we reſt in ſuch things as theſe?</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſs we have many good people that are full of prayers and tears, and they ſhall deliver the Iſland.</p>
               <p>It is true, there are many (bleſſed be God) and we have cauſe to wiſh that there were many more:
<note place="margin">Numb. 11.13.</note> and to ſay as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> when he would have had him forbid <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> that propheſied in the Camp of the Iſraelites; <hi>Would God that all the Lords people were Prophets, and that he would put his ſpirit upon them.</hi> So we, of ſuch godly men that walk with an upright heart: would God that there were many ſuch. But yet are not theſe as <hi>Lillies</hi> among Thorns? a few amongſt many men? Are not theſe the objects of reproach, and contempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt an unrighteous generation? Who are the men that are cryed down moſt by the world, that are moſt oppoſed, and injured by all men?</p>
               <p>Are not theſe they that ſupport the land by their prayers, and hold up all by their ſtanding in the gap? May we not rather fear that God will avenge the quarrel of his ſervants upon an ungracious, and ungrateful people they live amongſt?</p>
               <p>What ſhall we ſpeak of other things?
<note place="margin">Jer. 46.16.</note> Did no <hi>Bozrah,</hi> in <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.16. boaſt her ſelf of her ſcituation, <hi>that ſhe dwelt in the clefts of a rock?</hi> Saith God; <hi>though thou hideſt thy ſelf in the clefts of the rock, though thou ſhouldeſt make thy neſt, as high as the Eagle, I will bring thee down from thence.</hi> It is not talking that our Iſland is ſcituate in the Sea, and environed with walls: Judgment can leap over the Sea as well as the peſtilence hath done our walled Towns. It is a vain thing, and yet if you hearken to the diſcourſe of moſt men, you ſhall ſee that this is that that keeps them ſecure.</p>
               <p>Or it may be,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 48.15.</note> as ſome in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.15. <hi>We</hi> (ſay they) <hi>have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement, when the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſs thorow, it ſhall not come unto us.</hi> Well (ſaith the Lord) <hi>your covenant with death ſhall be diſſanulled, and your agreement with hell ſhall not ſtand, when the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="154" facs="tcp:47453:84"/>ſcourge ſhall paſs thorow, then you ſhall be trodden down by it.</hi> When judg ment cometh, of all the people in the world it ſhall certainly meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>you.</p>
               <p>What mean theſe idle dreams, and vain-conceits, that when we go on in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed condition, and in a courſe of ſin and impenitency: yet becauſe you have the Miniſters, and the ordinances, and the people of God amongſt us, becauſe we are convenient for ſcituation, and ſuch like things. Theſe are vain things, they will do us no good at that time: and for the preſent, they ſhew our ſecurity, our horrible ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4. Continual increaſe of ſin.</note> take another evidence, and that is, the abounding of the ſins of the Land. Were it poſſible that at ſuch a time as this, of ſhaking the Rod, the Sword over us, when judgments are upon the Nation, that there ſhould be ſuch abundance of iniquity in all places, if men were not in a dead ſleep? How doth drunkenneſs ſtagger and reel in every ſtreet? How doth pride vaunt, and boaſt it ſelf in every Church and Aſſembly, though it be cryed down never ſo much? Alas (beloved) are theſe times to pride up our ſelves in vanity? Are theſe times to run after the ſenſual, and ſinful courſes of an ungodly generation? Theſe are times wherein God calleth for faſting, and brokenneſs of heart. <hi>Lay aſide thy fine apparrel</hi> (ſaith God to the people) <hi>that I may know what to do unto thee.</hi> We ſhouldlay aſide theſe things, that we may ſhew our ſelves to be men awake,</p>
               <p>But men generally do ſo abound in wickedneſs and ungodlineſs, that we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude, as it is in the Revelation, that the time is now come too neer, He that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill; that is, let him go on to the end. It is evident and apparent, that ſin is increaſed ſince the ſickneſs: it is apparent that our ſins are aggravated, though they are dayly cryed down. And now at this time, as if we would defie God to his face, and call upon him to haſten his judgments upon our Land, upon our Families, and perſons, every one ſtrives (as it were) who ſhall outdare him moſt, in our exceſſes, in impenitency, in hardning our ſelves in a courſe of ſin.</p>
               <p>Theſe things convince us of our ſecurity. There are many more that might be named, if the time would permit. But put theſe together, and they may ſhew us our wretchedneſs. When we conſider how little we have profited by judgments: how little we have profited by the ordinances: how full of vain confidence, and idle dreames: how notwithſtanding all theſe we abound ſtill in wickedneſs, and there is no reformation of our hearts and lives: what may we not conclude againſt ourſelves?</p>
               <p>If ever people were drowned in a drunken ſecurity, we of all people under heaven are at this time. For of all people under heaven, we are in a manner the laſt: God hath ſpared us to the laſt. We have had warning by judgments inflicted upon others, for many years together. It hath come neerer to us hy degrees: it began a far off in <hi>Bohemia:</hi> and then in the <hi>Phalatinate,</hi> and in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Lord would have us ſee how he cometh to us by degrees, by ſteps, that at the laſt we may meet him by repentance. But where is the man that yet gets out of the bed of ſecurity, that cometh out of his ſleep to meet the Lord? that comes with a broken heart to beg for forgiveneſs of his ſins paſt, and to beg for mercy for the time to come?</p>
               <p>Well now,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For exortation.</note> ſince it is ſo, that we are convinced by theſe ſigns that we are in a carnal and ſinful ſecurity: we ſee then (ſo many of us at leaſt, that are children of the light, and of the day) what cauſe we have to be awakened, and to do that for others, which they will not do for themſelves: to be more earneſt in prayer, more frequent in humbling our ſouls, for our own ſins and theirs, that God may lay aſide, and caſt away his judgments and diſpleaſure, that either are feared, or lie upon us.</p>
               <p>Is it not a fearful thing, that when the Lyon roareth, the beaſts of the Forreſts tremble; Yet the God of heaven roareth againſt the world at this day, and the proud hearts of men, do not tremble before him? Shall the beaſts of the forreſts be afraid of the Lyon, more then the poor worms of the earth, of the mighty God of <pb n="155" facs="tcp:47453:84"/>heaven and earth? But this is the horrible Atheiſme and Infidelity, that is in the hearts of men, that they beleeve not Gods power and juſtice, nor his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you let every man be exhorted,

<note place="margin">3. Heretiques.</note> the enemies of the Church are awake: Heretiques are awake eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to bring men from the faith, to pervert the faith of many: oh be awake to prevent thoſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides, others are awaken to ranſack houſes, to deſtroy Cities oh: be awake, that you may be at peace with the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Armies, that hath all power in his hand to keepe you ſafe.</p>
               <p>Againe ſecondly,
<note place="margin">Mot. 2. The evil of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. In it ſelf a ſpiritual lethargy.</note> conſider the evil of this ſecurity you are in, of this diſpoſition of heart, when you cry, peace, peace, to your ſelves in the middeſt of Gods diſpleaſure. It is an evil diſeaſe: a ſpiritual lethargy. That diſeaſe we know in the body, it takes a man with ſleep, and ſo he dieth. Oh how many are in this ſpiritual lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, in this deep ſleep of ſin at this day, the Lord awaken them. It is the more dangerous, becauſe it is a ſenſleſs diſeaſe, a diſeaſe that takes the ſenſes from the ſoul: and diſeaſes (we know) that take away the ſenſes, are dangerous: for it is not only a ſign, that nature is overcome by the diſeaſe; but beſides, it draweth men from ſeeking for cure. Thus it is with the ſpiritual lethargy; it ſhews not only that ſin hath prevailed in the heart, that it hath overcome grace, and thereupon you have yeelded unto it; to your pride, and covetouſneſs, and vanity, as thoſe that are ſubdued under a diſeaſe: but it hindreth you from ſeeking the means to eſcape out of it. <hi>Thou ſaiſt</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>) <hi>that thou art rich, and needeſt nothing;</hi> and that was the reaſon ſhe ſought not to Chriſt. It is our condition: we have knowledg enough, therefore we care not for the Ordinances of God; We have faith enough, and therefore we care not for increaſing it: though none of us ſay thus with our tongues, yet moſt of us beleeve thus with our hearts. As <hi>David</hi> ſaith of the ungodly man, the wickedneſs of the wicked ſaith in my heart. So may I ſay, the neglecting of the ordinances, the careleſneſs of men in the uſe of the means of ſalvation, ſaith in my heart, that there is abundance of ſecurity, that they are in a ſpiritual lethargy that leadeth to death.</p>
               <p>As it is an evil diſeaſe,
<note place="margin">2. In the effects.</note> ſo it cauſeth much evil. It is that which driveth away the Spirit of God.
<note place="margin">1. It drives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſpirit of God.</note> It is the counſel of the Apoſtle, <hi>Grieve not the Spirit, quench not the Spirit:</hi> When we neglect the motions of the Spirit, the Spirit withdraweth it ſelf. Doth not your own experience tell you this? Conſider a little, what moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you have had: how God by the checks of your conſciences, ſomtime by ſecret incitements, as it were a ſpur upon your hearts, hath moved you to duty, and to leave your ſins. How have theſe moved you? you have had purpoſes it may be to perform theſe duties, to walk in the wayes of God, to pleaſe him in all things: the neglect of thoſe purpoſes, hath driven away the Spirit, it may be God now leaveth you to finall hardneſs.
<note place="margin">2. It lets in Sathan.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Again, it lettethin Sathan. <hi>When the unclean ſpirit is driven out, he goeth about 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47453:85"/>
ſeeking reſt, and finding none, at laſt be returneth from whence he went, and findeth the houſe ſwept and garniſhed; and he entreth in, and bringeth ſeven ſpirits more, worſe then himſelf.</hi> Alas! how many men are there, that for a ſit, in ſome particulars have altered their courſe, and have thought to become new men: yet ruſhing upon former occaſions, and temptations to ſin, they have grown ſecure and careleſs, and now Sathan hath gotten ſtronger hold of them, with ſeven ſpirits worſe.</p>
               <p>Nay,
<note place="margin">3. Hinders our Communion with Chriſt.</note> this is that, that drives away Chriſt, and the comfortable influence of his Spirit in the heart. The Church in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. was aſleep, was in a ſpiritual ſlumber: and Chriſt goeth away, <hi>She ſeeks him whome her ſoul loved, but ſhe could not find him.</hi> I ſpeake now, to thoſe that were awake, and are now aſleep: their hearts it may be are awake: but they walk not with that watchfulneſs, and humility of ſpirit before the Lord as they ought: therefore now they are heavy, and deſtitute of the comforts of the Spirit. Well, they may thank themſelves: Chriſt hath hid himſelf to teach them to be more watchful.</p>

                  <hi>That ſervant that ſaith in his heart, my Maſter deferreth his coming, and therefore he eats, and drinks with the drunken:</hi> what is the iſſue of it? <hi>He ſhall have his portion given him with hypocrites, where there is weeping, and wailing, and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 24.</p>
               <p>Here is enough (I ſuppoſe) to awaken you.
<note place="margin">Makt. 24.</note> Whenſoever the heart of man is held down with ſecure thoughts of Gods diſpleaſure, and thinks it is at peace with God, it is an evident ſign that wrath is a coming. Nay (beloved) in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you are in carnal ſecurity; in that meaſure you are under wrath: let that therefore be enough to awaken you: and ſay thus with your ſelves: It were better for me a great deal, to be among the number of thoſe, that complain, and are mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians; then to be in the number of thoſe that are full of jollity, and joviality, that rejoyce and ſport themſelves, that put far from them the evil day: I might then eſcape the wrath of God, as they do. Who are they that eſcape wrath? See in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 9. Thoſe that were awake when others ſlept, thoſe that mourned, when others laughed,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.</note> thoſe that humbled themſelves before God, when others hardned themſelves: thoſe were the men that were <hi>marked in the forehead by the Angel,</hi> and they eſcaped.
<note place="margin">Mala. 3.</note> And in the third of <hi>Malachie; Thoſe that feared the Lord, and thought upon his name, (in thoſe evil times) that ſpake oft one to another; there was a book of remembrance of them, and they are Gods jewels;</hi> he will be ſure to keep them ſafe.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall we come to be awakened?
<note place="margin">Helps to watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</note> I ſhould have told you ſome helps for this: I will but touch upon a few in a word.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will propound ſobriety as a main help. Would you be watchful, and kept from ſpiritual ſlumber,
<note place="margin">1. Sobtiety.</note> take heed that you keep your ſelves ſober. I ſpeak not of ſobriety, as it is oppoſed to drunkenneſs, though that be one thing, <hi>Be not filled with wine, wherein is exceſs, but be filled with the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Epheſ.5. As if he ſhould ſay,
<note place="margin">Eph. 51</note> you cannot be filled with the holy Ghoſt, and with exceſs of Wine: perſons that take liberty in exceſſive drinking, certainly they are deſtitute of the holy Ghoſt, and ſo of life and ſalvation. But I mean a further ſobriety; that is, as it is oppoſed to worldly-mindedneſs. Take heed that you plunge not your ſelves too much in the world, and worldly pleaſures and cares: for theſe are againſt the rule of ſobriety. Be ſober in your diet, in your apparel, in your gaining, in your ſpending, in your mirth, in your company, in every thing: that is, moderate your ſelves, and your affections in theſe things. A man may ſoon grow to ſuch a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, by exceſſe in worldly affections, that he may be in a dead ſleep, neglecting Gods judgements, and his own eſtate, as we ſee men that plunge themſelves in worldly buſineſs are. It takes away the thoughts of thoſe things that concern our ſpiritual good.</p>
               <p>I ſay not that you ſhould leave off the buſineſs of the world: for every man muſt continue in the calling that God hath ſet him. But I ſay, moderate your affections <pb n="157" facs="tcp:47453:85"/>to the things of the world: Do worldly buſineſs with heavenly minds, in obedience to God: Do them with waking hearts; to repent for the ſins of your callings, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide the ſins of your callings. And that that I ſay of labouring in your callings, I ſay of pleaſures, and of every thing elſe; we ſhould be watchful and ſober: as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be ſober and watch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Spiritual exerciſe.</note> if you would be free from ſecurity, which is a forerunner of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; be ſure to keep your ſelves in exerciſe. A man that would keep himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, will buſie himſelf in ſome exerciſe, and imployment or other. What exerciſe ſhould a Chriſtian uſe? The exerciſe of grace, and of the duties of obedience. Be ſure to keep your ſelves in the exerciſe of all the advantages that God giveth you in your lives, to imploy your graces in. In difficulties and ſtraits, exerciſe your faith. In provocations to anger and diſcontent, exerciſe meekneſs. In croſſes and troubles, and afflictions, exerciſe patience. In the miſeries and wants of others, whether ſpiritual or corporal, exerciſe mercy. And what I ſay concerning grace, I ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning duty. Keep your ſelves in the exerciſe of prayer, and reading, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conference, ſome one thing or other, ſome holy employment or other, that may keep the ſoul waking. For I tell you, you ſhall find, that whenſoever you let fall ſpiritual exerciſe, you will at that very inſtant fall into carnal ſecurity in ſome kind or other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. Continual fear.</note> would you keep your ſelves from this dead ſleep of carnal ſecurity, then keep your ſpirits in fear. Sorrow and grief makes a man heavy; but ſear keeps a man waking; when <hi>Jacob</hi> feared <hi>Eſau,</hi> he kept a watch that night. <hi>Sampſon</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Philiſtims, and it wakened him out of his ſleep. Fear makes a man watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. You may perceive it in your own experience. In that meaſure that the fear of God prevaileth, ſecurity is expelled. Keep fear therefore. Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes, but he that hardneth his heart falleth into evil. Mark how he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the hardning of a mans ſelf in carnal ſecurity, to the fear of God. Keep your heart in a conſtant feare. Reaſon thus; Alas! <hi>ſhall I do this thing, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Will not God be offended and diſpleaſed? Shall I go on in this vanity? Would I have the judgement of God find me in this company? would I have it ſeize upon me in this imployment, in this buſineſs, in this action? Fear leſt God ſhould ſtrike thee in ſuch an act, leſt Death ſhould ſeize upon thee in ſuch a place, and let that make thee keep a conſtant watch againſt the ſhares that are in thoſe places.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4. Good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Eccleſs. 4.</note> keep good company. Company you know is a good means to keep men awake. <hi>Two are better then one, and wo to him that is alone,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> I ſay good company: for there are a company that will infect you. <hi>Keep not company with a froward perſon, leſt thou learn his frowardneſs.</hi> So, keep not company with drunken, and ſwearing perſons, theſe are the Divels inſtruments, to keep a man in carnal ſecurity. No, keep company with thoſe that have a charge given them, <hi>to exhort one another daily, and to conſider one another, to provoke to love, and good works.</hi> Keep company with the Saints, and make uſe of all opportunities to provoke others, and to be provoked by others. That is the fourth help.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">5. Be alwayes as in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Pſal. 139.</note> would you be kept from this ſinful ſecurity: then keep God alwayes in your ſight. It is a good way for a man that would keep himſelf awake, to fix his eye upon ſome object. Fix your eye upon this main object, God. <hi>Whether ſhall I depart from thy preſence,</hi> faith <hi>David.</hi> This is that the Lord would have his people to conſider,
<note place="margin">Jer. 23, 23.</note> to keep them from ſin, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Am I a God at hand</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and not a God a far off? Do not I fill heaven and earth, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Can a man hide himſelf from God in any ſecret place? Think in thy chamber, in thy parlour, in thy ſhop, in thy houſe, in thy friends houſe, in the ſtreet, in the Church, in every place whereſoever thou art, that there God is alſo. If a man had but alwayes ſome one before him as a witneſs, he would not venture upon many things, that he now doth. If a malefactour ſhould ſee the Judge before him: if the child had alwayes his fathers eye upon him: or the ſervant had alwayes his Maſter ſitting about him, and above him (though there are many that are unjuſt ſervants) yet nevertheleſs he would ſerve him, at leaſt with eye-ſervice. Now ſet your ſelves in the eye of God, that ſees you in the dark: hears you in your moſt <pb n="158" facs="tcp:47453:86"/>ſecret whiſperings: knows every action of your life, and every circumſtance of thoſe actions. This will be a means to keep thee from ſecurity.</p>
               <p>I will add but one more,
<note place="margin">6. Conſider <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> which is the ſixt. Conſider thy latter end: The night is now coming upon us. If it were told any of us, that this night thou ſhalt die, as it was told the rich man in <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall they take away thy ſoul:</hi> I think there is none that heareth me this day, but he would certainly keep waking this night. But it is not bodily waking we plead for; but ſpiritual waking, a waking from ſin, a waking to repentance: And we tell you that Death is now at the door, ready to ſeize upon you. We ſpeak not only to you that are aged, that are at the brink of the grave: but we ſpeak alſo to you that are young: Death may ſeize upon you, and ſtrike you this night: be awakened now to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<note place="margin">Revel. 3.2.</note> I remember what God ſaid to the Church of <hi>Sardis; Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things that remain.</hi> That Church was aſleep, as many of us are at this day. God cometh to awaken you now, as he did them, that that little good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you have left, may be renewed and confirmed. You that are quite out of the way of grace, and go on in a courſe of ſin: ſit now down, and humble your ſouls: get into a ſecret corner, wherein you may conſeſs thoſe many provocations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you have provoked God all your dayes: and reſolve to amend, if the Lord ſpare you. Begin now, delay it no longer, it may be the laſt night, the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night to you: take this warning now therefore; be awakened to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>This is that the Scripture calleth upon ſo much,
<note place="margin">Bcckſ. 11.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Eccleſs.</hi> 11. <hi>Rejoyce O young man, in the dayes of thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in thy youth, and walk in the wayes of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all this, thou ſhalt come to Judgment:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; You that are in the middeſt of your delights, that ſolace your ſelves in the middeſt of the abundance of the earth, which you enjoy, that ſport your ſelves in the pleaſures of this would, know that there will come a Judgment day, ſee therefore now, what will beſt anſwer God then. <hi>Since the end of all things is at hand,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>let us be ſober, and watch.</hi> We know not how neer the end of the world is, we know indeed it ſhall not be yet, be cauſe Antichriſt muſt be deſtroyed, and the Jewes called before that day come: but nevertheleſs, certainly thy end is neer, thy day, thy particular death (and that is the time of thy particular Judgment) may be ſudden: <hi>It is appointed for all men once to die, and after that cometh the Judgment;</hi> That is the particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that cometh upon Death; ſo I ſay, this may be the night of thy death, and the morning, may be the day of thy particular doom. <hi>Judg your ſelves now, that you may not be Judged of the Lord:</hi> It was the uſe that the Apoſtle made even to good men: <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>many are ſick, and weak, and many ſleep:</hi> that is, they are dead: what then? <hi>If we would Judg our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged of the Lord.</hi> So ſay I to you, judg your ſelves: now bring your ſelves as priſoners before the Bar: arraign your ſelves as malefactors before the Judg: bring out the particular bills of inditement againſt your ſelves, whereby you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God: yet there is mercy, the day of grace, and opportunity of repentance, and turning unto God, yet laſteth; therefore do it now. I might add many other helps to this purpoſe, but theſe ſhall ſuffice at this preſent.</p>
               <p>We have an example before our eyes, enough to warne us of this. Here is an example of Death, which ſhould teach us now to awaken our ſelves, and not to live ſecurely, as men that dream of a long life, for many years.</p>
               <p>Here is a young man dead: took away in the prime of his time, in the beginning of his dayes: his ſickneſs though it held him not long, yet it was ſomewhat vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. How know you what a ſhort time you have, though you are now young: or if you live longer: what ſickneſs you may have: it may be you may be deprived of your reaſon and ſenſes: therefore now, while health, and reaſon, and ſenſe, while theſe <hi>Warning Sermons</hi> are afforded, take time, and make uſe of time, leſt your ſecurity make good this Text upon you. <hi>When they ſhall ſay Peace, Peace, then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape.</hi>

               <p>Continual, becauſe their war is never at an end.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:47453:87"/>The three principal of theſe (ye know) are commonly reckoned up to be. The <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> But the Apoſtle telleth us of a fourth, which he calleth our <hi>Laſt enemy,</hi> the enemy which ſhall laſt of all aſſault us, the other will leave aſſaulting us, when we are in this world; this, when we are leaving the world, muſtereth up his forces againſt us: ſometimes holding us long play, as the houſe of <hi>David</hi> did the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> till our ſtrength be waſted and ſpent; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſpatching us with a ſudden ſtroke, as <hi>Abſolom</hi> did <hi>Amnon,</hi> when <hi>our hearts are merry</hi> within us.

               </p>

<note place="margin">Plal. 9.6.</note> It is our <hi>laſt enemy,</hi> we may think it none of the leaſt, becauſe it is <hi>the laſt:</hi> yet here is the deſtruction of it, <hi>Oh thou enemy, thy deſtruction ſhall come to a perpetual end.</hi> It is already deſtroying, and as it is <hi>the laſt,</hi> ſo at the laſt it ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe are the two points that I am to treat of;
<note place="margin">The parrs of the Text.</note> of an <hi>Enemy,</hi> and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this <hi>Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Enemy</hi> is <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>the laſt Enemy</hi> (as the Text calleth it) <hi>the laſt</hi> that ſhall aſſault us. In that ye may note two things;</p>
               <p>Its Quality, and Its Rank.</p>
               <p>Firſt its nature and quality, An <hi>Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, its order and rank; in what rank it is Fyled, not in the Fore-front of the battel, but it cometh behind in the Rear, it cometh in the end of the Army (when all other enemies have given over) and ſetteth upon us at the laſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here is the deſtruction of the enemy, that is the Milk and honey of the Text. <hi>Death</hi> though it be an <hi>Enemy,</hi> though it be a killing <hi>enemy,</hi> it ſhall not be a conquering <hi>enemy.</hi> He that ſubdueth all our Enemies for us, will in time ſubdue them to us. And who he is, the Apoſtle telleth you in the verſe before the Text, <hi>Chriſt our Lord, He ſhall reign till he hath put down all his enemies under his feet:</hi> And as all His, ſo all ours too; both thoſe that are Enemies to him, and to his death. Among the reſt, he will deſtroy that alſo; As it is <hi>the laſt,</hi> with which we ſhall be aſſaulted, ſo it is the <hi>laſt that ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three points of obſervation we have here lying before us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that <hi>Death is an Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that <hi>Death is our laſt Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that as <hi>Death</hi> aſſaulteth us <hi>laſt,</hi> ſo at <hi>laſt it ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe, <hi>That Death is an enemy.</hi> And an <hi>Enemy</hi> indeed it is; one of the Divels regiment. The Divel he is the General of the Army: when he brought ſin into the world, he brought <hi>Death</hi> into the world. Sin draws <hi>Death</hi> after it, as the Needle draws the thread.</p>
               <p>Firſt I will ſhew ye what kind of Enemy it is.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1: A common enemy. 1 King 22: 31</note> Common to all man-kind. The charge it hath, is not like that upon the Aramites, fight neither with ſmall nor great, ſave only with the King of Iſrael. Great and ſmall, King and Keifar, all are marks that this aimeth at:

               </p>
               <p>I had thought (I confeſs) to have ſtood a little upon this points diſcuſſion,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> but I muſt not. I have many things to ſay. In a word therefore; Firſt, theſe are but a few, and a few make not a general.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though theſe die not the ordinary natural death, but as <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Enoch, ſhall be tranſlated</hi> up to heaven; yet in their tranſlation and aſſumption, they ſhall ſuffer a mutation and change which ſhall be inſtead of <hi>Death.</hi> Their change is a kind of <hi>Death</hi> to them, as our death is a kind of change to us.</p>
               <p>Therefore we may account it a common Enemy to man-kind,
<note place="margin">Joſh: 23: 14.</note> for as the Scripture ſaith,
<note place="margin">Job 30: 23.</note> 
                  <hi>It is the way of all the earth.</hi> And the Grave it is <hi>the houſe appointed for all living.</hi> It is a common Enemy, and it is the more dangerous for that.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2: A ſecret enemy.</note> it is <hi>A ſecret Enemy;</hi> And it is the more dangerous for that. Secret Traytors are worſe then open enemies: theſe may be prepared againſt, becuaſe we know them: thoſe may ſurprize us unawares, becauſe we ſee them not, nor ſuſpect them. Poor <hi>Uriah</hi> carrieth <hi>Death</hi> in his boſome: ſo we carry <hi>death</hi> about us, though like a Moth it lie and fret in the garment, and we ſee not when it eateth, nor can certainly determine the time when it will grate aſunder the thread of our life. What man living candivine when, and how, and where <hi>Dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>h</hi> will ſeize upon him? it is not for any to determineſuch a thing, it lieth ſo ſecret, he cannot find it out.</p>
               <p>What a ſort of diſeaſes we are ſubject to, you may imagine how many. Nay yea cannot imagine how many, when the very eye (as ſome Occoliſts obſerve) have above ſixty diſeaſes. What a many caſualties there are every moment, when as oft as we ſtep over the threſhold, we cannot tell whether ever we ſhall come home again. <hi>The fire ſaith, Death is in me; and the water ſaith, Death is in me;</hi> the earth we tread on hath <hi>Death</hi> in it; the Ayre we breath in, that which we continually take in, and put out at our noſtrils hath <hi>death</hi> in it: <hi>Death</hi> dwelleth with us in our houſes; it walketh with us in the ſtreets; it lyeth down with us in our beds; it is wrapped about us in our cloaths that ſtick to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Benhadad</hi> is ſlain in his Bed. <hi>Ammon</hi> at his Table. <hi>Zachariah</hi> in the Temple. <hi>Joah</hi> at the Altar. The diſobedient <hi>Prophet</hi> is torne with a Lyon. The unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Prince</hi> is trod to <hi>Death</hi> in the croude. <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſlain with a Mill-ſtone; and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> with the fall of a Tyle. <hi>Adrian</hi> is choaked with a flie. <hi>Victor</hi> is poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with Wine. And one of the <hi>Emperours</hi> with the bread he received in the Sacrament. Thus <hi>Death</hi> waiteth every where, and yet we ſpie it not. It is a ſecret Enemy, and therefore the more dangerous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3: A ſpiritual Enemy.</note> it is a <hi>Spiritual Enemy.</hi> And it is the more dangerous for that. Spiritual I call it; Firſt, becauſe it is inviſible, for the ſpirits are inviſible, they cannot be ſeen; Such an <hi>enemy</hi> is <hi>Death,</hi> though we muſt all feel it, yet we cannot ſee it: were it any way diſcernable, we might think of ſome way how we might ſhift and ſhun it: but it is beyond the ken of our eyes: we are no more able to ſee that then the Ayre: being therefore out of ſight, it is out of our reach, we know not how to grapple with it; we know not with what weapons to encounter it.</p>
               <p>And a <hi>Spiritual Enemy</hi> I call it, becauſe though it ſeize on the body, it ſtrikes at the ſoul: By Gods decree the <hi>death</hi> of the ſoul is a concommitant of the <hi>death</hi> of the Body, and were it not by Gods mercy reverſt, they wouldſtill come like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and thunder, and ſtrike both together.</p>
               <p>Again, it is a <hi>ſpiritual enemy,</hi> becauſe it fighteth againſt us in the ſtrength of ſin. <pb n="162" facs="tcp:47453:88"/>It cometh armed with a <hi>Sting, the ſting of de ath is ſin.</hi> Some make queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if <hi>Adam</hi> had never ſinned, he ſhould ever have died. But me-thinks the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> putteth it out of queſtion; <hi>By one mans diſobedience ſin came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom: 5: 12.</note> 
                  <hi>and by ſin death.</hi> All thoſe <hi>Deaths</hi> that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> reckoneth up:</p>
               <p>Firſt when the ſoul is deprived of God, ſeparated from him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when the body is ſeparated from the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when the Soul is ſeparated from the body, and from God, and ſuffereth torments for a time.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, when the ſoul is ſeparated from God, and rejoyned to the body, to ſuffer torments eternally. All theſe are the recompence, and reward of ſin. Therefore <hi>Death</hi> coming, and being an Enemy thus armed, (whatſoever kind of <hi>death</hi> it be) we may well ſay it is <hi>a ſpiritual enemy,</hi> and the more ſpiritual, the more dangerous.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and Laſtly,
<note place="margin">4: A continual Enemy.</note> it is <hi>a continual enemy.</hi> And it is the more dangerous for that. It laies hold of us in the womb, and never leaves us, till it hath brought us to the Grave. Beloved, we do not only die when we die, but all the time we live, aſſoon as we begin to live, we begin to die. As <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every day we die, becauſe every day ſome part of our life is gone.</hi> As a candle, it is no ſooner lighted, but preſently it begins to waſte: as an hour-glaſs, it is no ſooner turned, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſand begins to run out. So our life, it is no ſooner breathed, but preſently it begins to vapour out. As the Sea, what it gaineth in one place, it loſeth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo our life, what we gain one way, we loſe it in another: look what is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, ſo much is took from it; the longer a man liveth, the leſs he hath to live. <hi>Death</hi> doth by us, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did by <hi>Eſau,</hi> catcheth us in the wombe, and never lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us.</p>
               <p>So we ſee it is a Common, a Secret, a Spiritual, a Continual Enemy.</p>
               <p>Next we are to conſider;
<note place="margin">Wherein Death is n Enemy.</note> How and wherein <hi>Death</hi> ſheweth it ſelf an <hi>Enemy.</hi> What Death deſerveth at our hands, to be thus accounted and ſeared. Fearful and terrible it is, that is certain; So <hi>Ariſtotle, It is the moſt terrible of all terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jeb: 18: 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Bildad</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi> calleth it the <hi>King of terrours,</hi> What doth <hi>Death</hi> bring with it to make it fearful?</p>
               <p>I anſwer,
<note place="margin">In reſpect of its attendants. 1: ſickneſs, &amp;c. <hi>Heb:</hi> 2: 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Death</hi> hath ſundry concomitants, and companions that attend it, that make it a formidable Enemy.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Harbingers that come along with it; Sickneſſes, and diſeaſes, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, old age, and difficulties. Theſe are all fearful to nature, and through fear of theſe, <hi>Death keepeth men all their life in bondage.</hi> They make our lives, <hi>as it were</hi> a life, rather like a life, then a life indeed. So that howſoever the Apoſtle ſaid in another place,
<note place="margin">2: Cor: 6.</note> 
                  <hi>as it were dying, and behold we live.</hi> There <hi>Death</hi> hath the <hi>tanquam,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> the <hi>Ecce:</hi> yet here we may ſay, <hi>as it were living, and behold we die:</hi> here <hi>life</hi> hath the <hi>tanquam,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> the <hi>Ecce.</hi> Life is but <hi>as it were</hi> a life,
<note place="margin">Plal: 39: 6.</note> it is but the ſhadow of a life that man walketh in: <hi>Man walketh in a vain ſhadow, and diſquieteth himſelf in vain.</hi> It it true, it lighteth not on all alike, ſome it cometh on as a Lyon, and breaking <hi>their bones from morning to evening,</hi> it makes an end of them: to others it is as a Moth in the garment, ſecretly in their lives, by degrees, inſenſibly, pining and conſuming them. Howſoever, what Harbinger ſoever it bringeth, it viſiteth us with many touches and twitches, before it come: falling pell-mel, thick and three-fold on us, when they come. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of theſe, it may be ſaid to be an enemy.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2: Diſſolution of the frame of nature.</note> the diſſolution that <hi>Death</hi> bringeth. For it <hi>diſſolveth the frame of nature;</hi> It divorceth, and ſeparateth the Soul from the Body, thoſe two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that have lived ſo lovingly together, and perhaps have lived a long time together. This is another thing that makes <hi>Death</hi> look like an <hi>Euemy.</hi> Friends and companions that have lived long together are loath to part: we ſee in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, old folk commonly are more loath to part, when they are old, then when they are young. Now there is none neerer then the ſoul and body: there is none have lived ſo long, or ſo loving: it muſt needs be tedious for theſe to part, and <pb n="163" facs="tcp:47453:88"/>be an affliction and vexation, when neither the body can longer retain the fleeting ſoul, or the ſoul longer ſuſtain the drouping body. Therefore in reſpect of this alſo, <hi>Death</hi> being the cauſe of this, no marvel though nature reluctate, and we look upon it, as on the face of an <hi>Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. The Grave.</note> the horrour of the Grave: <hi>the men of darkneſs,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> calleth it: the place of oblivion; the pit of ſtinch and rottenneſs; this is another thing that nature ſhrinketh and relucts at. For there we muſt bury out of our ſight, that that once was <hi>the delight of our eyes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 24.16.</note> as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaid by his wife. And though it were never ſo lovely before, yet it quickly becometh loathſome. Our Beds muſt be made in darkneſs, where <hi>corruption and wormes,</hi> muſt be the Mattreſs and Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to lie under us, and ſpread over us; <hi>Thou ſhalt ſay to Corruption, thou art my father,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 14.11.</note> and to the worme, thou art my mother, and my ſiſter.</hi> That body of thine, that God in the wombe ſo <hi>wonderfully made,</hi> that thou all thy life-time (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure) haſt delicately cheriſhed, lapped in Silk, in Fur, pampered with ſweet wines, <hi>Death</hi> as a proud Tyrant will ſet his foot upon it, and throw thee down to the horrid dungeon, where thy fleſh ſhall putrifie, and thy bones rot, and the beauty of it (though ſomtime it were as the Roſe and the Lilly of the field) ſhall ſoon become as loathſome as the dung in the ſtreets. This is another thing that makes the face of <hi>Death</hi> dreadful and terrible, when we think of ſuch privations and annihilations as theſe, that we ſhall come from a beeing to no beeing. Theſe cannot but make <hi>Death</hi> look with the face of an <hi>Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4. Loſs of worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments and actions.</note> 
                  <hi>The loſs and deprivation of all worldly contentments,</hi> and worldly imployments: that is another thing that makes <hi>Death</hi> terrible and fearful to us. Look whatſoever contentment we took in any thing here, we muſt bid it farewel then. Farewel to all, to prophets and pleaſures, and honours, we ſhall carry none of them away with us;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.9.</note> 
                  <hi>None of our pomp and glory ſhall deſcend after us,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſaith. Farewell to all the gold and ſilver we have gathered together, to all the goodly lands we have purchaſed, to all the ſtately houſes we have built, to all the pleaſant gardens, and orchards we have planted, to all the ſports and paſtimes, we have had, to all our merry conſorts we have kept company with, to all our Jewels and wardrope, to our dauncing, and feaſting, and muſick: <hi>Death</hi> pulleth us from all theſe, and layeth us levell with the Duſt; It mingleth ſhovels and Scepters together; It makes rich and poor, the Prince and the Peaſant alike; <hi>I ſhall ſee man no more.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 38.11.</note> All relatians we have now, ſhall be broken off then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Husband and Wife, Parents and children, Maſter and ſervants, neighbour and neighbour, friend and friend: we ſhall dwell apart with our ſelves, and not ſo much as ſhake hands one with another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the ſervices and imployments</hi> we are took up with here, ſhall ceaſe then: there ſhall be no frequenting of the Exchange, no exerciſing of Trade, no bearing of Office, no working in our Calling. <hi>Death is the night that no man can work in;</hi> and <hi>Death is the place of ſilence,</hi> where all affairs are cut off: Where there is <hi>no work nor invenſion, nor wiſdome, nor counſel,</hi> as <hi>Solomou</hi> ſaith in the book of the <hi>Preacher.</hi> Oh ſaith good <hi>Hezekiah; I ſhall ſee the Lord no more in the Land of the living.</hi> There is no more ſervice to be done to the Lord, nor no more in the Church, in that manner as it is now: there is no exerciſe of Religion, no Word, no Sacraments, no Faſting, no Almes, no Preaching, no Prayer, no Confeſſion and thankſgiving.
<note place="margin">Pſal 6.</note> 
                  <hi>The Corſe cannot praiſe thee, the Grave cannot give thanks, they that go down into the pit cannot honour thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh (Beloved) how careful and active, and vigilant, and diligent ſhould this make us to be (when we conſider it) for the well improving of that time that we have lent unto us, and for the well-diſcharging of thoſe places, and offices, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are now laid upon us; Conſidering that <hi>Death is an enemy</hi> that will cut us off from all affairs,
<note place="margin">5. Conſciance of ſin, and certainty of Judgment and uncertainty of ſalvation.</note> and bereave us of all opportunities of receiving, or doing, or performing any ſervice to God at all, either in Church or Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, <hi>Conſcience of ſin, and certainty of judgment,</hi> and uncertainty of ſalvation (for brevities ſake I put them together) theſe things come along with <hi>Death,</hi> and make the face of <hi>Death</hi> terrible and fearful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:47453:89"/>
                  <hi>Conſcience of ſin</hi> firſt of all. For <hi>Sin it is the ſting of Death.</hi> And which of us is there that doth not arm <hi>Death</hi> with that ſting? Who can reflect on the paſſages of his life, but he ſhall find it as full of ſin, as the <hi>Leopard of ſpots.</hi> We find nothing in ſin now, but oblectation and delight, and therefore we <hi>hide it under our tongue,</hi> and hugg it in our boſomes. Oh but when <hi>Death</hi> cometh once, it thruſteth theſe things out, and oh the horrour and anguiſh that the poor conſcience is tormented and made to ſmart with.</p>
               <p>Again, with conſcience of ſin, <hi>certainty of judgement;</hi> that is another dreadful Arrow in Deaths quiver;
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.27.2. Cor 5.10.</note> 
                  <hi>After Death cometh judgement. And we muſt all appear before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, to receive according to what we have done in our bodies.</hi> Firſt, the particular judgement that paſſeth upon the ſoul, it ſhall never be reverſt, for as the <hi>Tree falleth, ſo it lieth.</hi> And then the General judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Body and Soul ſhall both be wrapped up in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 33.14.</note> Oh who <hi>can dwell with devouring fire? with thoſe everlaſting burnings?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then laſtly; The <hi>uncertainty of our future eſtate.</hi> For how many thouſands be there that die, that can not tell what becometh of them when they die, but they muſt ſing that Farewel to their ſouls as <hi>Adrian</hi> to his, <hi>My poor wandring ſoul, whether art thou going? What will become of thee? Death</hi> then being accompanied with ſuch an Army of Terrours as theſe, the Apoſtle might well call it, as it is in the Text; <hi>an Enemy.</hi> That is the firſt thing,</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to conſider how it is called the laſt Enemy.</p>
               <p>For two reaſons; Firſt, becauſe it is the <hi>laſt</hi> that ſhall aſſault us. So <hi>Caietan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Why Death called the laſt enemy.</note> becauſe it is the <hi>Laſt that ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> So the common ſtream of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters.</p>
               <p>It is the <hi>Laſt Enemy</hi> that ſhall aſſault us.
<note place="margin">1. Becauſe it is the laſt that ſhall aſſault us. Therefore we have more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies than Death.</note> And here I have to note two things;</p>
               <p>Firſt, that while we live in the world, we have more Enemies in the world. For when there are ſome laſt, there muſt be others going before. If <hi>Death be the laſt Enemy,</hi> there are ſome others beſide. I, we have ſo (God knoweth) Enemies on every ſide. Without us, within us.</p>
               <p>The Divel he is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to us,
<note place="margin">The Devil.</note> and vollies of tentation he hath to diſcharge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. So many tentations, ſo many <hi>Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>World</hi> is an <hi>enemy</hi> to us:
<note place="margin">The world.</note> An <hi>enemy</hi> when it ſeemeth a friend; When it ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it betrayeth: it kiſſeth and killeth. On the right hand it hath proſperity to allure; on the left hand adverſity to affright; in every corner, wicked counfell, and company, and examples to ſeduce and inſnare us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">The fleſh.</note> our own <hi>fleſh</hi> is an <hi>enemy.</hi> It is a Serpent we carry in our boſomes. The <hi>Divell</hi> is a Serpent in Hell: the <hi>world</hi> is a Serpent in our hand: the <hi>fleſh</hi> is a Serpent in our boſome. We carry it with us where ever we go: It is a con-natural, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate <hi>Enemy.</hi> All our other <hi>enemies</hi> could do us no hurt, if it were not for that; if this <hi>enemy</hi> that cohabiteth with us, did not combine againſt us. Know (who ever thou art) there is no <hi>Enemy</hi> like thy ſelf: thy ſelf is the worſt enemy of all. All the ſparks that ſlie out of Sathans engines, could never <hi>ſindg a hair of our heads,</hi> if our <hi>fleſh</hi> were not as tinder. All the winds that blow in the four corners of the world, could not <hi>make ſhipwrack</hi> of us, if our <hi>fleſh</hi> were not a treacherous Pilot. <hi>Death</hi> (that gnaweth the thread of our ſoul and body aſunder) could not ſeparate them, or them from God, if the <hi>fleſh</hi> did not what the teeth of it, and ſharpen it with a ſting.</p>
               <p>So then we ſee, we have a great many <hi>Enemies</hi> more to encounter us beſides Death, ſome without, ſome within. Therefore how ſhould this teach us cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect walking? to <hi>behave our ſelves wiſely in every thing,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> when he knew <hi>Saul</hi> was his <hi>Enemy,</hi> and had an eye upon him to do him miſchief. How ſhould it teach us to pray with <hi>David;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 27.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord teach me thy way, and lead me in the right path, becauſe of mine enemy?</hi> That is one thing I have to note.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">Therefore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the worſt enemy.</note> another thing I have to note; If <hi>Death</hi> be the <hi>last enemy,</hi> then in all probability it is like to be the worſt. Of the Divels regiment it is, (I told ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) He is the General of the Army. And (beloved) beleeve it, the Divel is very politick and ſubtile, in marſhalling his forces, he will not place his beſt Souldiers in <pb n="165" facs="tcp:47453:89"/>the forefront of the battel, but keeps them in the Reare, he puts them behind, that when all the reſt have wearied and tired us, they ſhould ſet on us afreſh. He is ſo cunning a diſputant, that he reſerveth the beſt arguments for the laſt. A cunning Gameſter, that plaies his beſt play at the laſt; A cunning Archer, that ſhoots his beſt ſhaft at the laſt. So ſince <hi>Death is the laſt Enemy,</hi> it is like to be the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
               <p>Now the ſorer we are like to find him, the carefuller we ſhould be to arme againſt him: alwayes to put our ſelves in a readineſs, that whenſoever he cometh, he may find us weaponed: that if it were poſſible, we might be alwayes doing, as if we were dying, it being the height of the perfection, that any ſoul can attain to (as the heathens themſelves well obierved) <hi>for a man to ſpend every day, as if it were his laſt day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is one reaſon why the Apoſtle here calleth <hi>Death the laſt Enemy,</hi> becauſe the <hi>laſt is like to be the worſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2. Becauſe it is the laſt that ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note> another reaſon. As it is the laſt by which we are aſſaulted, ſo it is the <hi>laſt that ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> That the Apoſtle principally meant here (as Interpreters commonly underſtand it) when he ſaith, the <hi>laſt enemy that ſhall be Deſtroyed is Death;</hi> he meant that <hi>Death is the Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed laſt.</hi> And this leadeth me to the laſt point I propounded to ſpeak of, <hi>That Death is an enemy, and the laſt enemy, and at laſt ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſhall be deſtroyed, that is one thing.</p>
               <p>Who undertakes the doing of it?
<note place="margin">Who it is that deſtroyeth Death.</note> Our ſelves; In likelihood Death is more likely to deſtroy us, then we it. But as it is ſaid of the <hi>ſeven-ſealed book</hi> in the Revelation, <hi>when there was none in heaven, or in earth, or under the earth, that was able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 5.3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lion of the tribe of Judah, prevailed to open the book.</hi> So the <hi>Lion of the tribe of Judah</hi> prevaileth to <hi>deſtroy</hi> this <hi>enemy,</hi> that <hi>none in heaven, or in earth, or under the earth, but only he, is able to deſtroy.</hi> He ſaith of him, as <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Goliah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 17.23. Hoſ. 13.14.</note> when he defied the hoſt of Iſrael, and all men ran away, <hi>Let no mans heart fail him.</hi> So ſaith the ſon of <hi>David, The Lord of David, let no mans heart fail him, I will go to fight with yonder Philiſtim. Oh Death I will be thy death. It is ſpoken in the perſon of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3.15.</note> whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth <hi>the Lord of life.</hi> He ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all Enemies, and it is he that will <hi>deſtroy Death,</hi> he will not leave him, till he have <hi>trod him under foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when will Chriſt do this?
<note place="margin">When Death ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note> We ſee <hi>Death</hi> playes the Tyrant ſtill, it killeth and ſpoyleth, as faſt as it did? his ſickle is in every ones harveſt; as faſt as the corn grows up, he cuts it down, he leaveth not an ear ſtanding. How long Lord, how long before this (that the Apoſtle tells us of) will be?</p>
               <p>At <hi>laſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">At the day of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> His meaning is, at the general day of the Reſurrection: when the end of the world ſhall come, then Chriſt ſhall <hi>deſtroy</hi> him. And he bringeth it in the rather, to aſſure the Corinths of that, that ſome of them doubted of; namely, that there ſhould be a Reſurrection. For unleſs the <hi>dead ſhould ariſe,</hi> how can <hi>Death</hi> be <hi>deſtroyed?</hi> But <hi>Death</hi> ſhall be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> therefore it is out of queſtion that the <hi>dead ſhall riſe again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what comfort have we in the mean time, if <hi>Death</hi> be not <hi>deſtroyed</hi> till then? if till then it play the domineering <hi>Enemy?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No,
<note place="margin">Comfort in the mean time.</note> not ſo neither. We have comfort enough in that, that Chriſt hath already done. Though it be not already <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> yet it is already <hi>ſubdued.</hi> It is not only ſubdued, but diſarmed, and not only ſo, but captivated, and triumphed over. He ſubdued it when he died; in ſuffering <hi>death</hi> he overcame <hi>Death;</hi> he beat him in his own ground, at his own weapons; in his own hold he diſarmed him. When he roſe again, then he ſpoyled him of his power, and took his weapons away, and triumphed over him in the open field. When he aſcended into heaven, then he carried thoſe ſpoils with him in token of conqueſt, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> took the <hi>Gates of Gaza on his ſhoulders, and carried them to the top of the hill.</hi> Chriſt by Death took the <hi>ſting of Death</hi> away; by his Reſurrection he took the <hi>ſtrength of Death</hi> away; by his Aſcenſion he took away the <hi>hope of Death,</hi> for ever conquering or prevailing more; finally, at the laſt Judgement he will take away the name and Being of <hi>Death,</hi> 
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:47453:90"/>ſo that it ſhall never be more remembred, but <hi>mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I, Chriſt hath done this for himſelf (perhaps) but what is this to us?</p>
               <p>Nay, Chriſt hath done it, not only for his own victory, but he hath <hi>given us victory:</hi> he is not only a conqueror, but he hath made us conquerors: <hi>thanks be unto God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 15.57.</note> 
                  <hi>that hath given us victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, Chriſt hath, and will do by <hi>Death,</hi> as he doth by our ſins: he hath ſubdued them already: at the laſt he will utterly deſtroy them: ſin and <hi>Death</hi> both of them are already ſubdued, at laſt they ſhall be aboliſhed and deſtroyed, that they ſhall he no more. As there ſhall be <hi>no more ſorrow and pain,</hi> ſo there ſhall be no more <hi>death</hi> and ſin:
<note place="margin">Rev. 7 17. Hoſ. 13.14.</note> 
                  <hi>All tears ſhall be wiped from our eyes: I will ranſom them from the power of the grave, and redeem them from death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>More then this; This yet addeth to our comfort, Chriſt will ſo <hi>deſtroy Death,</hi> as be will not only ſubdue him for us, but alſo reconcile him to us: not only foil him as an <hi>Enemy,</hi> but propitiate, and make him our friend. We have all our <hi>enemies</hi> ſubdued to us, but ſome are ſo ſubdued, that they are reconciled: <hi>Death</hi> is one of them, it is a reconciled, as well as a ſubdued <hi>enemy.</hi> Inſtead of bringing forth <hi>children for bondage,</hi> it becometh a purchaſer of our freedom: it is ſo far from pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from Chriſt, as rather it letteth us into Chriſt: ſo far from being a loſs, as it bringeth gain: ſo far from being a dammage, that it is part of our Dowry: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle reckoneth it as a prerogative, as he ſaith, that <hi>the world, and life, and Chriſt is ours,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3 22.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo Death is ours.</hi> Indeed if <hi>Death</hi> were not ours, life were not ours; for our only way to life now is by <hi>Death.</hi> Such a friend is this <hi>Enemy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, that it is a Bridge to paſs to heaven: the <hi>Chariot</hi> that we are took up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in. What we get of life toward life, we loſe in <hi>death,</hi> but what we get in <hi>death</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life, we never loſe.</p>
               <p>Now for the Application, and concluſion of all. Something I have to ſay by way of comfort, and ſomething by way of counſel.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> by way of comfort; Againſt the fear of <hi>Death,</hi> or againſt over-much ſorrow for thoſe that <hi>Death</hi> takes away.</p>
               <p>It is true.
<note place="margin">Death an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy only to the wicked.</note> 
                  <hi>Death is an Enemy.</hi> But to whom? only to the wicked that are out of Chriſt, to thoſe that have no benefit at all by his Death and Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion. When <hi>Death</hi> cometh and findeth out theſe, they may ſay as <hi>Ahab</hi> did to <hi>Eliah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King 21.20</note> and more truly a great deal, <hi>haſt thou found me, oh mine Enemy.</hi> (It is the worſt <hi>Enemy</hi> they have in the world. It is a cruel Sergeant, that catcheth them by the throat, and arreſteth them for a debt that they are never able to pay: It draggs them to the Jayl, caſteth them into the Dungeon, to the chains of Darkneſs. I have not a word of comfort to ſay to them. They have no more comfort in <hi>Death,</hi> then they have in Hell, where though they ſhall lie in torments and pain, they ſhall not have a <hi>drop of water to cool their tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to the ſaithful in Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Death to the beleever is</note> there is comfort upon comfort. For though Death be an Enemy, yet remember, firſt it is a ſubdued Enemy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a reconciled Enemy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, an Enemy that one day ſhall not be at all.</p>
               <p>It is a ſubdued Enemy,
<note place="margin">1. A ſubdued Enemy.</note> that is one comfort. The ſtrength and ſting of it is gone. When a Bee hath loſt his ſting, and is a Droan, it can hurt no more. So Death is a Droan to a Chriſtian, it hums and buzzeth, it doth no hurt, it cannot ſting, the ſting is gone.</p>
               <p>Againſt all thoſe Enemies that I formerly told ye of, that are attendants on Death, here is comfort.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is true: <hi>Death</hi> cometh with ill Harbingers, it bringeth ſickneſſes, and aches, and pain, but there is comfort againſt this. For when God ſendeth pain, remember he promiſeth to ſend patience too:
<note place="margin">Gant. 8.3.</note> that he will put his hand under to help, <hi>His left hand ſhall be under us, and his right hand over us,</hi> to catch us: he hath promiſed comfort upon our ſick beds,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 41.3.</note> 
                  <hi>to make our bed in our ſickneſs.</hi> We need not make ſuch an Allegory as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth: this ſweet fleſh of ours, the Bed of our ſoul, it is under infirmities and weakneſſes: God helpeth us, he makes our bed: <pb n="167" facs="tcp:47453:90"/>
                  <hi>he ſaith to the ſick of the Palſey, Take up thy bed: he turneth our bed in our ſickneſs,</hi> either he ſends us health, (ſo ſome exponds it) he turns the bed of ſickneſs, into a bed of health: or God turneth our bed for us in our ſickneſs; that is, he refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, giveth us eaſe, when we lie upon our ſick beds. It is a Metaphor borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thoſe that attend ſick perſons, that help to make their Beds eaſie and ſoft, and turn them, that they may lie at eaſe: So God hath promiſed his children in the painfull time of ſickneſs, to make their Beds eaſie and ſoft, to cauſe them to lie at eaſe by the Patience that he will give them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is true, <hi>Death</hi> bringeth diſſolution, and diſſolveth the frame of nature, it ſeparateth and divorceth thoſe two loving companions, the Soul and the Body. But there is comfort in this. For though it divorce the Soul and the Body, yet it cannot deſtroy the ſoul and the body: even the body is in the hand of god, when it is rotting in the earth, as the Soul is tranſlated to heaven. Again, though they be ſeparated, yet it is but for a time, one day they ſhall meet more joyful, and glorious then ever before, and after that they ſhall never be ſeparated again. Laſtly, though he ſeparate the ſoul from the body, and the body from the ſoul, yet neither from Chriſt, nor Chriſt from them. Nay, it is ſo far from ſeparating, that it helpeth to unite us to Chriſt, (as I ſaid before) the dſſolution of thoſe ſhall be the conjunction with him;
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> 
                  <hi>I deſire to be deſſolved, and to be with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is true, the horrour of the Grave attendeth <hi>Death,</hi> and the putrifaction of this fleſh of ours, that muſt turn to corruptneſs, it makes it terrible and fearful. But there is comfort againſt this. For after that time of putrifaction, there ſhall be a time of reſtitution, and though the worms devour this fleſh of ours, <hi>yet in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> very fleſh of ours,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 19.27.</note> 
                  <hi>we ſhall ſee God another day, Theſe eyes ſhall ſee him.</hi> There is comfort in that, that when God ſhall come to reſtore us with himſelf, what the Grave hath cloathed with corruption,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.21.</note> he will cloath with glory; <hi>theſe vile bodies, he will make them like the glorious body of Chriſt,</hi> without all corruption.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is true, <hi>Death</hi> depriveth us of worldly friends, of worldly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this makes it terrible; Yet there is comfort againſt this. Though we be deprived of worldly friends,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.23.</note> it carries us to heaven, to better company, <hi>to Angels, to the ſpirits of juſt and perfect men, to God the Judge of all, to Jeſus the Mediatour of the New Teſtament.</hi> Nay beſides, one day he will reſtore again thoſe very friends, of which here we are deprived: though we loſe them for a time, in heaven we ſhall meet again, and there renew a perpetual league of ſociety and love. So though it deprive us of worldly benefits, it cannot of heaven, and thoſe are better, they are not <hi>pleaſures of ſin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.11.</note> 
                  <hi>that laſt for a ſeaſon, but at the right hand of God, that endure for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So though it deprive us of worldly ſervices, it carrieth us to heaven, to thoſe that are better, that are high and proper to the Church triumphant, ſuch as befit the Church, to <hi>ſing Hallelujahs;</hi> and ſuch as are profitable to the Church Militant, by the memory of good examples, and by the prayers they offer to God, not in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, for they know no mans particular wants, yet for the general and common good of all.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly; It is true, the conſideration of ſin, and of Judgement, and our uncertain eſtate after <hi>death,</hi> makes it terrible like the face of an <hi>Enemy.</hi> Yet there is comfort againſt theſe.</p>
               <p>For ſin. I told you that though there be a <hi>ſting</hi> in the Serpent, yet Chriſt hath drawn out that <hi>sting,</hi> ſo that being a Serpent without a <hi>ſting,</hi> we may do as <hi>Moſes, take it in our hand,</hi> put it into our boſome, and it will never do us hurt, to them that die in the Lord: <hi>Death rather came</hi> by ſin, then for ſin; It is not between ſin and damnation, but between ſin and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>For judgement? It is true, <hi>Death</hi> preſenteth judgement, but it preſenteth it with comfort, for the day of judgement, is the day that the godly look for, and long for, as the day of redemption, not of confuſion; when they ſhall receive the ſentence by which they ſhall be abſolved, and not condemned. For they know when God ſhall come to be their Judge, he ſhall come to be their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:47453:91"/>And ſo for the uncertainty of our future eſtate after <hi>death.</hi> It is true, the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t ate of the dead, in regard of natural underſtanding, it may be a thing uncertain and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, yet from the ſecret revelation of Gods Spirit, the Saints in ſome meaſure know how it will be with them after <hi>death;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>We know though our earthly tabernacle be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, we have a building given us of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe things are helps to give us comfort againſt the fear of <hi>Death,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Enemies</hi> that <hi>Death</hi> comes attended with: that though it be an <hi>Enemy,</hi> yet it is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Enemy.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. A reconciled Enemy.</note> it may comfort us, to conſider that <hi>death</hi> is not only a ſubdued, but a reconciled <hi>Enemy;</hi> of an <hi>Enemy</hi> it is made to be a friend: it is ſo to all the faithful; ſuch a friend, as they have not a better in the world. It is moſt certain; the wicked have not a worſe <hi>enemy</hi> in the world then <hi>death,</hi> and the godly have not a better friend; ſo ye ſhould ſee if I had leiſure to ſhew you, on the one ſide from what labour and care, and miſery, it helpeth to free them; and on the other ſide, to what comfort, and reſt, and peace, and joy, it helpeth to bring them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">3. An Enemy that at laſt ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Rev. 20.</note> it may comfort us, to conſider that as <hi>death</hi> is an <hi>enemy,</hi> a ſubdued <hi>enemy,</hi> a reconciled <hi>enemy;</hi> ſo it is an <hi>enemy,</hi> that <hi>at laſt ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> The time ſhall come when <hi>death and Hell ſhall be caſt into the lake of fire;</hi> the meaning is (I think) they ſhall be ſhut up in the bottomleſs pit, where they ſhall only have leave to exerciſe their power on the Divel, and damned reprobates that lie there in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Death on the one ſide ſtill gnawing of them that they ever die, and yet Hell on the other ſide, ſtill preſerving of them, that they ſhall everlaſtingly live. But the godly, and the faithful <hi>ſhall have their part and portion given them in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to life,</hi> where they ſhall never <hi>taſte of death more.</hi> What the Apoſtle ſaith of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.9.</note> is true of all thoſe that are in Chriſt, <hi>when they are once dead, they ſhall die no more,</hi> Death <hi>hath no more dominion over them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I cannot enlarge thoſe comforts; Yet (beloved) I have a word or two of counſel, I pray harken to it. Birefly thus.</p>
               <p>Chriſt though he have overcome,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>

                  <hi>death</hi> being an <hi>enemy</hi> to us, we muſt prepare and arm our ſelves againſt it, that it may not be an <hi>Enemy</hi> too ſtrong.</p>
               <p>And for your better direction take theſe few heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt,

Die to ſin.</note> Remember that <hi>death is the wages of ſin.</hi> It is ſin that lead <hi>death</hi> into the world: it is in reſpect of that, that <hi>death</hi> is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to us, and were it not for that, it would be no <hi>Enemy</hi> at all. Now then (beloved) if ye will not die in your ſins, let your care be to <hi>die to ſin:</hi> labour to have ſin die in thee, and then thou ſhalt not die in that. When thou haſt committed drunkenneſs, or prophaneneſs, &amp;c. think with thy ſelf, this is pleaſant and ſweet now; but how will this taſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day, when I ſhall come to lie upon my death-bed, and my ſoul ſhall ſet on my pale lips, ready to take her flight, and be brought before the Judgement ſeat of Chriſt? <hi>What fruit will theſe things bring then?</hi> What comfort, and peace, and joy, will it procure to the conſcience then? Oh (ſaith <hi>Abner</hi> to <hi>Joab</hi>) <hi>knoweſt thou not, that this will be bitterneſs in the end?</hi> It will be as gall and wormwood, therefore if ye would not have <hi>death</hi> be bitter then, let not ſin be ſweet now: part with ſin betime. That is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Live to God.</note> learn to <hi>walk humbly with God</hi> betime, and betime put your ſelves in a way of repentance, and new obedience: take heed of dallying with God, and procraſtinating, and putting off the time. What is the reaſon why a ſort die (as <hi>Pline</hi> ſaith ſome do, that are ſtung with the Serpent <hi>Colemion</hi>) ſome laughing, ſome raging, ſome ſottiſh and ſecure, others hoping, ſome diſpairing? They have not been careful to walk with God while they lived; becauſe they wanted care then, they want comfort now. <hi>They that remember not God in their life</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>it is juſt with God to forget them in death.</hi> The Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter</hi> would <pb n="169" facs="tcp:47453:91"/>have us <hi>look for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs.</hi> But never look thou to dwell in that heaven where righteouſneſs dwelleth, except righteouſneſs dwell in thee: And he exhorteth us, <hi>that we be found of God in peace at that day:</hi> that is ſweet and comfortable indeed; but remember, <hi>Peace and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs go together,</hi> if we would be <hi>found of God in peace,</hi> we muſt be <hi>found of him in holineſs:</hi> Walk in holineſs and uprightneſs, and then <hi>peace ſhall kiſſe</hi> thee on thy death-bed. <hi>Mark the upright and juſt man, the end of that man is peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. Be oft in the meditation of death.</note> the better to ſubdue <hi>Death,</hi> be willing to meditate and think oft of <hi>Death,</hi> learn the Art of dying, practiſe the way of it betime, learn to die daily.</p>
               <p>How ſhall we do that?</p>
               <p>I will ſhew you. Conſider we have many little deaths to undergoe in the world, as whave many delights; Learn to inure and acquaint thy ſelf before hand with the patient and quiet bearing and enduring of theſe many troubles and croſſes that befall thee, As <hi>Agamemnon firſt overcome the Lacedemonians by wraſtling, and then by fighting; and</hi> Bilney <hi>firſt burnt his finger in the Candle, that after he might the better endure the burning of his body at the ſtake.</hi> So think with your ſelves, If I cannot endure a little, how ſhall I endure more? If I cannot endure a light croſs, a ſmall affliction, do I murmur at that? Am I impatient and repine at that? How ſhall I bear the pangs of <hi>Death,</hi> when they come? Therefore let us inure our ſelves to a meek, and quiet bearing of leſſer ſtripes, ſo we may be better able to endure heavier ſtrokes. Many of us lay out a great deale of care how to live in the world, we had more need take care how to die, when we ſhall leave the world. Study the Art of dying; That is the third.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that we may the better ſubdue <hi>Death,</hi> that it may not be an <hi>Enemy</hi> too ſtrong;
<note place="margin">4. Settle all things before hand, that</note> Learn before ſo to diſpoſe of our ſelves, and order our affairs, that when <hi>Death</hi> cometh, we may have nothing to do but to die. Get all differences reconciled, all doubts ſettled, all reckonings ordered: ſequeſter our ſelves from all other avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that nothing may interrupt us, when that work is to go inhand with. <hi>Put thy houſe in order</hi> (ſaith God to <hi>Hezekiah;</hi>) I ſay ſo to every one of you. Firſt,
<note place="margin">concern the outward man,</note> your outward houſe, that which concerneth your worldly eſtate, <hi>put that houſe in order.</hi> What? wouldeſt thou make thy Will and teſtament, and be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about that, when thou hadſt more need to have that Will and teſtament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that Chriſt hath made?</p>
               <p>And then ſet thy ſoul and conſcience,
<note place="margin">The inward.</note> thy inner houſe in order, let not conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be to ſeek then of any thing that concerneth thee for thy peace toward God and man. Die thus, and die happily. Though <hi>Death be an enemy,</hi> yet thou ſhalt not be hurt of it, becauſe it is ſubdued, and at laſt thou ſhalt get the victory over it, when thou ſhalt ſee it uttery <hi>deſtroyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now as I have exhorted you to do this, by way of counſel, ſo yet a little further I crave patience, that I may encourage you to do it by way of example: By the example of this bleſſed ſervant, and Saint of God, for whoſe occaſion you have given this meeting, and I have preached this Sermon.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to do by her, as <hi>Mary Magdelen</hi> did by our Saviour Chriſt, to <hi>break a box of Spiknard and pour it on her,</hi> that I may <hi>anoint her for her burial.</hi> Concerning whom, though I could ſay a great deal, yet (knowing how well ſhe was known to you) I ſhould not be afraid to ſay too much. Yet on the other ſide (becauſe the night is farr ſpent, and becauſe ſhe was ſufficiently known to you although I ſpeak but a little, I ſhall ſpeak enough. She dwelt among you: who is he that can ſpeak ill of her? who knew her but reported well of her?</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reduceth all the practical parts of Chriſtianity to three heads;
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Living ſoberly, and righteouſly, and holily: The grace of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath appeared, and teachth us to do all this.</hi> She had learned to live ſoberly; She was a pattern of ſobriety. Sober in her countenance, in her diet, in her apparel, in her ſpeeth, in all her behaviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the grace of God taught her to live righteouſly,</hi> both in thoſe things that concern the works of juſtice, and thoſe things that concern the works of mercy, both are referred to righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:47453:92"/>For her juſtice, I am perſwaded ſhe was exceeding careful in all her wayes <hi>to keep a good Conſcience.</hi> I am ſure ſhe was a woman very diligent and painful in her Calling, ſhe was truly one of thoſe good houſe-wives that <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribeth in <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. and had ſtudied that Chapter well, and attained the practiſe of it: ſhe could never endure idleneſs in any: there was no plague (ſhe ſaid) to idleneſs; and that diligence in our Callings ſets open a door to many bleſſings, and ſhuts up the door to many tentations. I may call her a diſcreet woman, <hi>that was a crown to her husband;</hi> ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid a vertuous woman is. He had a rich portion, when God gave him her. <hi>Houſes and lands come by inheritance, but a Prudent wife cometh of the the Lord.</hi> She was an excellent guide to her family, to her ſervants: Children ſhe had none. She had ſuch children as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of, and he ſaith, they are thoſe children that <hi>women are ſaved by.</hi> What children, ſaith he? Good works: and thoſe children ſhe was full of. She did the part of a Mother in bringing up her ſervants that were with her: inſomuch as ſhe would ſay ſometimes (though they were none of her own children) <hi>Behold, here am I, and the children that God hath given me.</hi> And for works of mercy aſwell as juſtice, ſhe was moſt open-hearted and handed, not only to do according, but beyond her ability: alwayes ready upon every occaſion <hi>to diſtribnte, and adminiſter to the neceſſities of the Saints,</hi> and provoked, and ſtirred others to the doing of the like. Among her neighbours ſhe lived unblameably: A woman of a <hi>meek and quiet ſpirit,</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Such of God are much ſet by.</hi> She was no tatler, nor buſie medler in other folks matters.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Piety,</hi> ſhe was remarkable. She ſhewed it both in her health and ſickneſs. In her health, both publikely and privately. In publike, She was a religious fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter of the ordinances on the Lords day, and on the week dayes, a diligent hearer and attender, an exceilent rememberer: one of the beſt Remembrancers that I have heard of. And in private, ſhe was excellent for duties there, both for the diſcharge of her own duty, by giving enſample to others, and many times by good and godly exhortations and inſtructions, and daily by private reading and prayer, ſhe ſet apart ſome time for her ſelf, for private meditation.</p>
               <p>In her ſickneſs, ſhe was a ſpectacle for thouſands to look on. It pleaſed God to lay a long and heavy affliction upon her. She had a Cancer in her breaſt, that had been on her three years: in the two laſt years ſhe ſuffered a great deal of extremity, as you may imagine by one thing that I ſhall ſay. She was fain to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a great deal of dreſſing, with Corraſives and ſharp medicines; a great deal of cutting, and ſearing, and burning: ſhe was above fifty times burnt with hot Irons: but (Lord) with what patience did ſhe ſtill endure it? She would ſay, <hi>It was no matter; ſanctified afflictions were better then unſanctified proſperity. Apelles</hi> ſaid, when the picture of a beautiful woman was to be compleatly drawn; he muſt borrow one part from one, and another from another, and put all together. She had learned this. She had looked on many good patterns in the Scripture, and had drawn to her ſelf an imitation of them all, ſo that ſhe was a perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Model. Though I ſay much, yet I know, I ſay nothing but the truth. I read of few excellent woman in the Scripture, but ſhe made them a pattern of one vertue or other. For obedience, ſhe was a <hi>Sarah:</hi> for wiſdome a <hi>Rebecca:</hi> for meekneſs a <hi>Hannah:</hi> for a diſcreet temper, an <hi>Abigal:</hi> for good huſwivery, a <hi>Martha:</hi> for piety, a <hi>Mary,</hi> a <hi>Lydia.</hi> I know not any neceſſary thing, that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make up a good Chriſtian, but in ſome meaſure it pleaſed God to beſtow it on her. Thus ſhe continued all her life in the time of her health: and in ſickneſs with ſo much patience as (after a ſort) ſhe endured a martyrdome, and I ſee no reaſon but we may allow a Martyr of Gods making, a ſwell as of mans: I am ſure, if God make Martyrs,
<note place="margin">Prov. 31.29.</note> I know not any fitter then ſhe, ſo meek, and patient, and conſtant. <hi>Many daughters</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>have done vertuouſly, but thou ſurmounteſt them all.</hi> I will not ſay ſo of her, becauſe I decline flattery. But this I will ſay, that I know not many excel her, ſcarſe any that come neer her. She hath the reward of that ſhe hath done, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her of God, and <hi>her works follow her.</hi> We leave her to God, and having committed her ſoul into his hands, we beſeech his gracious favour upon our ſelves.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Eath</hi> and <hi>Judgement</hi> are two ſubjects, about the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of which, our thoughts ſhould every day be converſant; we ſhould every day be thinking of thoſe two dayes.

Now at this time (having the like occaſion) I thought it not amiſs for me to diſcourſe of that that cometh immediately after <hi>Death,</hi> that is <hi>Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Heb.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coherence.</note> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed to all men once to die, and after <pb n="172" facs="tcp:47453:93"/>Death cometh Judgment.</hi> And it is that that <hi>Solomon</hi> mindeth us of here in the words of my Text: which he addeth as a reaſon to that grave advice he gave in the verſe before going. Having diſcourſed at large in this book concerning the <hi>vanity</hi> of all earthly things, and the <hi>vexation</hi> among thoſe things that are under the Sun: he telleth us where it is beſt for us to ſet up our reſt: that is, in learning that one leſſon, <hi>Fear God, and keep his commandements, for this is the totall;</hi> all that God requireth. That we might the rather be ſtirred up to hearken to this counſel, he telleth us, that whether we do or no, the day will come that we ſhall be called to an account, when <hi>God will bring every one</hi> of us <hi>to Judgment,</hi> and take a tryal of <hi>every work</hi> we have done, and <hi>of every ſecret thing, whether it be good or evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In handling of theſe words we have two things in general that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks
<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> of.</p>
               <p>Firſt the perſon <hi>Judging.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly the things <hi>Judged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Perſon <hi>Judging,</hi> is God. And there I will ſpeak,</p>
               <p>Firſt of the <hi>Judg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then of the <hi>Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>things</hi> that God <hi>bringeth to judgment</hi> and tryal, he telleth us firſt, <hi>every work,</hi> every thing, be it never ſo <hi>ſecret.</hi> And then a more particular reſolution: thoſe things that are <hi>good,</hi> and thoſe things that are <hi>evil. God will bring every work to judgment, and every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the Perſon <hi>judging.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The perſon judging.</note> And here firſt of the <hi>Judge</hi> himſelf. <hi>God ſhall bring to Judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God eſſentially meant,
<note place="margin">God. <hi>Opera Triditatis ad extra ſuns indiviſa. Opera Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ad intra ſuns diviſa; cuique perſona incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municabiliter propria.</hi>
                  </note> all the Perſons in the God-head, Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt. For all concur in this work, being as the School-men ſay, <hi>Opus ad extra:</hi> It is one of the <hi>External</hi> works of the God-head: and it is an <hi>Axiome</hi> in Dviini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the <hi>External works of the God-head are not to be divided.</hi> It is true, there are certain internal works of the God-head, that are ſaid by the Schools to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, incommunicably proper and peculiar to every Perſon: as it is proper to the Perſon of the Father, incommunicably, to have his Being of himſelf. Of the Son, to be begotten of the Father. And it is the property of the holy Ghoſt, incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicably, to proceed from both. But thoſe works that they call <hi>External;</hi> that is, thoſe works by which the power and wiſdome of the God-head are externally made manifeſt to the creature, ſuch as creation, preſervation, redemtion: thoſe equally and indifferently proceed from all the Perſons: not from one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but from all in general: and this of <hi>Judgment</hi> is one. For as they all concur in the creating of us: ſo they ſhall in the judging of us: all of them ſhall co-operate together in the executing of juſtice and mercy; Juſtice in the damnation of the wicked, and mercy in the ſalvation of the godly.</p>
               <p>You will object peradventure,
<note place="margin">Object.</note> that the Scripture ſeemeth to ſpeak otherwiſe, though <hi>Judgment</hi> here be attibuted eſſentially to God, in ſome places it is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſonally to Chriſt; <hi>He ſhall judg the quick and the dead:</hi> and therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it is called in the Scripture, <hi>the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p>Again ſomtimes this work of Judging is appropriated to the Saints:
<note place="margin">2: Cor. 5.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Know yee not that the Saints ſhall judg the world?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.2.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. and by and by again, <hi>Know you not that we ſhall judge the Angels?</hi> verſ 3. How ſhall we reconcile theſe, when it is ſaid, Chriſt and the Saints ſhall judge?</p>
               <p>I anſwer;
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> This threefold doubt is reconciled by a threefold diſtinction. God is ſaid to <hi>judge,</hi> if we reſpect the Authority of Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>judge,</hi> if we reſpect the Promulgation of the ſentence.</p>
               <p>The Saints are ſaid to <hi>judge,</hi> if we reſpect the Approbation.</p>
               <p>The power and right are equally given to all three Perſons: but the particular Execution is given to Chriſt:
<note place="margin">How Chriſt is ſaid to be the Judg.</note> the Approbation of what Chriſt doth, is aſcribed to the Saints. As at at our common Courts of Aſſize here: one is ſet upon the Bench as Judg, and others are joyned in commiſſion with him, as Acceſſories: the Judge only pronounceth the ſentence, and they that ſit in commiſſion with him, ratifie and approve his ſentence that he pronounceth: ſo at that day; Chriſt <pb n="173" facs="tcp:47453:93"/>ſhall ſit upon his Throne as <hi>Judg;</hi> the Saints they ſhall joyn as Commiſſioners: Chriſt he alone pronounceth the ſentence upon every one that is ſummoned there to the tryal; but then his Apoſtles and Saints, that are joyned in commiſſion with him (for <hi>ſuch honour have all his Saints</hi>) they ſhall ratifie and approve, and give atteſtation to the ſentence that he pronounceth, and ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the condemnation of the wicked.</p>
               <p>So that the difference is eaſily reconciled, and we ſee how God, and Chriſt, and the Saints are ſaid to judg. The Authority is Gods. The Execution, Chriſts. The approbation, the Saints. The Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. makes the point plain, he telleth us that <hi>God ſhall judg by Chriſt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.16.</note> In that day God ſhall judg the ſecrets of <hi>all hearts by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh. 5. The Father Judgeth no man, but hath committed all power to the Son.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 5.</note> He hath given him power to execute <hi>judgment,</hi> as he is the <hi>Son of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why to him?</p>
               <p>For this Reaſon;
<note place="margin">Why God hath committed the power of the execution of Judgment to Chriſt.</note> That his ſecond coming may be in glory, to make amends for his firſt coming in humility; Chriſt at his firſt coming into the world, he came meanly, and homely: at his ſecond coming, he ſhall come triumphantly and gloriouſly.</p>
               <p>Before he came like a <hi>Lamb,</hi> then he ſhall come like a <hi>Lyon.</hi> Before <hi>in the forme of a ſervant,</hi> then in the form of a <hi>Lord.</hi> Before <hi>Pilate</hi> ſate upon the Bench, and Chriſt ſtood as a malefactour: but then <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhall ſtand at the Barr as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour, and Chriſt ſhall ſit on the Bench as Judg. He ſhall then openly come to ſhew himſelf a juſt <hi>Judg</hi> amongſt men, as before he came to be Judged: when he came privately he was Judged of them that were unjuſt: It was once a ſcorn that he <hi>the Son of man,</hi> ſhould be <hi>Judg</hi> of the world: therefore God will have him come and appear in that very <hi>form</hi> he was ſcorned in, that now they may behold him in his Majeſty, that before would not take notice of him, when he appeared in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: that they who the more contemptuouſly before eſteemed him in his baſeneſs, may now more ſeverely taſte of his juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God then is Judg.</hi> Not men. Not Angels, but God himſelf. Had men been our Judges, we might not fear the face of men, becauſe they are veſſels of the ſame earth as we, took out of the ſame pit, hewen out of the ſame rock. If Angels had been our Judges, we, ſhould not have ſtood in ſo much fear, becauſe (though they be Spirits more glorious then we yet by their own confeſſion) they are our fellow creatures, and our <hi>fellow ſervants;</hi> therefore we after a ſort participate with them in ſome degree of nature. But neither men, nor Angels ſhall be Judges then, but Almighty God, that as much excelleth men and Angels, as the heavens do the earth.</p>
               <p>And look what is neceſſarily required to the office of a <hi>Judg,</hi> it is incomparably found in him.</p>
               <p>To the office of a <hi>Judg,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties requiſit in a Judg.</note> there are three properties ſpecially required.</p>
               <p>Knowledg to diſcern.</p>
               <p>Power to determine.</p>
               <p>Juſtice to execute.</p>
               <p>In God, theſe are all of them tranſcendent and eminent.</p>
               <p>For Knowledg, he is the moſt wiſe.</p>
               <p>For Power, moſt abſolute.</p>
               <p>For Execution moſt juſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowledg to diſcern,</hi> that is the firſt. He that aſſumeth the perſon of a <hi>Judg,</hi> muſt needs be one of wiſdom and underſtanding.

Knowledg to diſcern.</note> Though he have the Scepter of authority in his hand, if he have not the eye of wiſdom in his head, if he be not able when men plead their caſe before him, as the <hi>two Harlots</hi> before <hi>Solomon,</hi> to decide to whom the right of the caſe belongeth, as he, to whom the <hi>living child</hi> pertained, he is as unfit to be a <hi>Judg,</hi> as an illiterate Ignaroe is to be a Prieſt. The <hi>Judges</hi> ignorance is the honeſt mans overthrow. We commonly paint Juſtice blind, not becauſe he ſhould be ſo that ſits in Gods ſeat of juſtice to decide Caſes, but only in reſpect of perſons. Blind <hi>Iſaac</hi> was fain to put forth his hands to feel whether it were <hi>Eſau</hi> or no that came to ask the bleſſing: it is a hard caſe, when <hi>Judges</hi> have <pb n="174" facs="tcp:47453:94"/>ſore eyes, that they cannot diſcern the right Caſe, but only by feeling. But it ſhall not be ſo here. <hi>God is the Judg,</hi> that is of infinite wiſdome and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is able to diſcern right and wrong. Of neceſſity it muſt be ſo, becauſe he is Omniſcient, he knoweth all things: he hath the true underſtanding of them: it is impoſſible to deceive him. Earthly <hi>Judges</hi> they ſomtime are blinded in the hearing of Caſes that are brought before them, for what their eyes ſee not, they are not able to diſcern, there are no glaſs windows into the boſoms and breaſts of men, by which they are able to come into their hearts: all the information they have, is from Evidences and Witneſſes, the hear-ſayes, and reports of others: where if any thing be concealed or miſtold, how eaſily may they miſcarry? But Gods knowledg is not ſo unſound or uncertain, becauſe he himſelf is an eare, and an eye-witneſs of all things that are: he knoweth whatſoever is done, he beholdeth not the actions only, but the very intentions, he is able to judg of the <hi>thoughts and intentions of the heart.</hi> It is but folly to think to hide any thing from him; heaven is not ſo high, but he can reach it: hell is not ſo deep, but he can ſearch it: the earth is not ſo wide, but he can ſpanit: the night is not ſo dark, but he can ſee it: the chamber, the bed, the cloſet, is not ſo cloſe, but he can pierce it: He that <hi>ſitteth upon the circle of the heavens,</hi> and <hi>whoſe eyes are as flames of fire,</hi> ſeeth every thing. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>There is no creature that is not manifeſt in his ſight, but all things are naked and open;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> like an Anatomized body, (for thence the Metaphor is drawn) where the bowels are laid open, and every nerve, and muſcle, and ligament, every Atome diſcovered, ſo that we may take a full view of it. In a word; if it were <hi>Davids</hi> commendation, that he <hi>was wiſe, as an Angel of God:</hi> how wiſe muſt God be, that infuſeth wiſdome into the Angels, and in <hi>whoſe ſight the Angels are fooliſh?</hi> That is the firſt thing requiſit in a <hi>Judg,</hi> he muſt have knowledg to diſcern.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place.
<note place="margin">2. Power to execute.</note> He muſt have <hi>power to execute:</hi> he muſt have authority to command: and not be as an Image ſet againſt a wall, for if he be ſo, Abjects will inſult over him: though peradventure ſome may regard him, becauſe he hath eyes to ſee, yet others will contemn him, becauſe he hath no hands to puniſh: ſo innocency ſhall be hopeleſs of recompence, and the wicked of their deſert. Again, if he have not power, if he have power only to hear, and not to determine: or if his power be reſtrained to ſome petty Caſes, and not alſo extended to matters of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſequence and moment: Appeals will be made, (as commonly they are) from inferiour Courts to the higher.</p>
               <p>But it is not ſo here: <hi>God is the Judg,</hi> who as he is infinite in knowledg, ſo he is in power and authority. We ſtile the King Supream head over all perſons, and in all cauſes in his Dominions: but God is over all the Dominions of the earth, ſupream over all: not only in all cauſes, and over all perſons, but over all cauſes too: even Kings are ſubject to his regiment: <hi>He bindeth Kings in chaines, and Nobles in fetters of Iron,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 149.</note> Pſal. 149. <hi>The Kings of the earth</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>John</hi>) <hi>and the rich, and the great men, and the great Captains, and the mighty men,</hi> they ſhall all <hi>hide themſelves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>in the caves, and rocks, and mountains,</hi> Revel 15. <hi>crying to the mountains and rocks, to cover them from the face of the Judg, and from the wrath of the Lamb, becauſe the day of deſolation is come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay God, is not only over all the Kings of the earth, but he is Potentate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell too: He hath a commanding power over all: the Angels fear, the Divels tremble, when they come to ſtand before God. In a word (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>all power is of God;</hi> then of neceſſity followeth, that God himſelf in his power is moſt abſolute. That is the ſecond thing belonging to the office of a <hi>Judg;</hi> as he muſt have knowledg to diſcerne, ſo he muſt have <hi>power to execute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly there muſt be <hi>Juſtice in the execution:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Juſtice in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> therefore the Grecians were wont to place juſtice between <hi>Libra,</hi> and <hi>Leo;</hi> to ſignifie indifferency in weighing cauſes, and ſtrictneſs in executing the ſentence. So the Egyptians ſignified as much by their <hi>Hierogliphical</hi> purtraicture of an Angel without hands, wincking, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eyes: ſuch a one a <hi>Judg</hi> ſhould be: he ſhould have no hands to receive bribes, nor no eyes to reſpect perſons: the perſon of a <hi>Judg</hi> muſt not take the perſon of a <pb n="175" facs="tcp:47453:94"/>friend: A man muſt not perſonate a friend in juſtice, but as <hi>Levi,</hi> he muſt <hi>know neither father, nor mother, nor brother.</hi> Juſtice amongſt us, is purtraicted hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Ballance in one hand, and a ſword in another: the Ballance ſheweth the upright weighing of cauſes, and the Sword ſheweth the ſtrictneſs of the execution of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p>And if this Execution be wanting both the other are to no purpoſe. It is to no purpoſe to know, and to have power, if their be not Juſtice. But God is a true and juſt <hi>Judg;</hi> Howſoever it be amongſt the <hi>Judges</hi> of the earth; yet unworthy is he of the place of a <hi>Judg,</hi> and fitter to ſtand at the Barr, then to ſit on the Bench, that ſuffereth himſelf to miſcarry by friendſhip or love, or bribes, or ſutes, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or envie; when either of theſe prevail, they tie the tongues of men to plead for wrong cauſes. Shall a Traytour preſume on the Kings favour, and <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi> be out of the Kings grace? But there ſhall be no ſuch thing here: <hi>God is the Judg of all the earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſhall not he do right?</hi> Gen. 18. <hi>Doth God pervert judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or doth the Almighty pervert Juſtice?</hi> Job 8.3. When thou ſtandeſt before the <hi>Judgment ſeat of</hi> God, thou ſhalt neither be elevated with vain hopes, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and caſt down by ſiniſter and wrong fears: but aſſure thy ſelf, ſuch as thy cauſe is, ſuch ſhall thy ſentence be, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> well; a pure heart ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail more with God then a ſmooth word: good conſciences ſhall ſpeed better then full purſes, for he is an upright and juſt Judg, with whom no fair words, nor friends ſhall prevail. So I have done with the firſt thing, <hi>The Judg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">The Judgment</note> ſomething of the <hi>Judgment:</hi> and therein two things;</p>
               <p>Firſt that it ſhall be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in what manner it ſhall be.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. It ſhall be</note> 
                  <hi>that it ſhall be:</hi> The text is plain. <hi>God ſhall bring to Judgment.</hi> There might many Texts beſides this be alledged conſonant, and agreeable to this: but it is ſuperfluous. Beſides Texts of Scripture we have Types alſo to prefigure it; and reaſons alſo to prove and confirm it.</p>
               <p>Two Types of the laſt Judgment,
<note place="margin">Types of the laſt Judgment. Luk, 17.</note> our Saviour himſelf propoundeth, <hi>Luk,</hi> 17. One was the deſtruction upon <hi>Sodome:</hi> the other, the deſtruction that God brought upon the old world. Look (as Chriſt ſaith) how it was with them of <hi>Sodome</hi> in the <hi>dayes of Lot, they did eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they builded:</hi> and look how it was with the men of the old world, <hi>in the dayes of Noah, eating and drinking, and ſporting, and marrying, until the very day that Noah entred into the Ark, and the flood came, and deſtroyed them all:</hi> So it ſhall be at the laſt day, <hi>when the Son of man ſhall come.</hi> The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the latter of theſe) telleth us of <hi>mockers in thoſe times,</hi> that ſcoffed when they heard of the <hi>Judgment:</hi> there hath been talk a great while of ſuch things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, but <hi>when will it come? Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> There are ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in theſe dayes, but ſuch (if there be any) cannot but ſpeak againſt their own conſciences, and knowledg: they cannot be ignorant both of the <hi>Judgments</hi> that have been, and ſhall be, (or if they be, they are wilfully ignorant;) That God did once waſh away the ſins of the world with a Flood of water, and that the time is coming, that God will purge the ſins of the world with a flood of fire: the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> in the clouds, as it is a Monument of the one; ſo it is a fore-runner of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The two principal colours of the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> are blew, and red, the blew and wateriſh colour of the <hi>Rainbow</hi> is an evidence of that Judgment that is paſt, when God waſhed the ſins of the world away by Water: the fiery colour is a prediction of a <hi>Judgment</hi> that is to come, when God ſhall purge the world by a Flood of fire.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe Types there are divers reaſons that may be given to aſſure us, that we have reaſon to expect this day. Thoſe five Attributes of God, afford five reaſons to confirm it. His <hi>Power,</hi> his <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> his <hi>Truth,</hi> his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt his <hi>Power;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 1.</note> God will have it be thus, for the manifeſtation of his Power. A work of great power it will be indeed. <hi>All muſt be brought before Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate,</hi> every one, as the Text ſaith after. It may ſeem ſtrange (peradventure incredible) to here that all the men and women that ever lived in the world, that ſo <pb n="176" facs="tcp:47453:95"/>many multitudes and millions of thouſands of all <hi>kindreds and nations,</hi> ſhould all be ſummoned to appear before one <hi>Judgement ſeat.</hi> But as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> faith, Conſider who is the doer, and then thou wilt not doubt. It is true indeed with men, ſuch a thing as this is impoſſible, <hi>but with God all things are poſſible.</hi> Could God at the firſt draw all things out of nothing, and cannot God as well bring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all again, when they are turned to nothing? Could he make that body of thine out of the duſt of the earth, and cannot he raiſe that body, when it is turned to duſt? Could he unite that body to the ſoul in the time of the Creation, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he unite it at the time of the Reſurrection? Certainly there is nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, too hard, to the great and terrible voyce of God (as Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith) to that voyce of God that <hi>cleaveth the rocks, that breaks the brazen gates aſunder, that looſeneth the bands of death.</hi> Therefore unleſs thou queſtion the power of God, no doubt but he is able, and can <hi>bring all of us to judgement.</hi> He will do it for the manifeſtation of his power.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> as for the manifeſtation of his power, ſo for the manifeſtation of his <hi>wiſdome.</hi> It is a point of wiſdome, when one hath made a thing, to bring it to the intended end for which he made it. Beloved, this is Gods intended end in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of us: therefore he brought us hither into the world, not that we ſhould have alwayes a Being here, but that after a certaine time we ſhould be diſſolved, and put into an everlaſting condition, therefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of the ſalvation of Gods elect, he calleth it, <hi>the end of their faith:</hi> not only the end they aſpire, but that end that God hath aſſigned, and appointed them to. If God ſhould faile of his end, we might call his wiſdome into queſtion: it might give us occaſion to ſay, that he undertook that, which he was not able to accompliſh: ſo that inſteed of ſhewing himſelf wife, he ſhould ſhew himſelf weake. Therefore except we ſhould call his wiſdome into queſtion, doubtleſs he will call us one day to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.</note> for the manifeſtation of <hi>his truth:</hi> nothing gaineth God more honour, then that he is faithful and true, in whatſoever he hath promiſed. Now this <hi>day of Judgement,</hi> is the day wherein God hath promiſed to recompence the faith of the godly,
<note place="margin">Act. 1731.</note> and hath threatned to puniſh the wickedneſs of the wicked: <hi>he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day for it,</hi> faith the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. What though it be a great while ſince the promiſe was made: for all this we muſt not think <hi>that God is ſlack as men account ſlackneſs?</hi> the ſlackneſſe of men is when they keep not their promiſe according to appointment: we muſt not think God is ſo ſlack, he alwayes keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his day that he hath ſet, he never faileth of his promiſe, but when the time is come, he keeps touch, he breaks not his day. As it is ſaid, <hi>Ezod.</hi> 22.41. <hi>After the four hundred and thirty years were expired that God ſpake to Abraham, the very ſame day, all the children of Iſrael went out of Egypt.</hi> How many promiſes and threatnings after do we read of, wherein he never failed of the performance of what he ſpake, the leaſt tittle? therefore (ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>) we have ſeen ſo many of Gods promiſes, already verified, that we may be confident, that thoſe that are to come, ſhall alſo be accompilſhed: ſurely he will not fail in this, but as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as he hath promiſed, it ſhall come to paſs. So that unleſs we ſhall deny <hi>the truth of God</hi> (who the Scripture ſaith, cannot, <hi>it is impoſſible that he ſhould lie</hi>) we muſt of neceſſity beleeve, that for the manifeſtation of his <hi>Truth</hi> there will be a day of <hi>Judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4.</note> as for the manifeſtation of his <hi>Truth,</hi> ſo of his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> I will put them together. It is the property of Juſtice to render puniſhment to thoſe that have done evil: and of Mercy to recompence thoſe that have done well. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the manifeſtation of his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> this day muſt come. It is true, here many times wicked men ſpeed better then Gods people: A man may <hi>ſin a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, and yet God porlong his dayes:</hi> and the children of God on the other ſide, are perſecuted and neglected: ſo that here he giveth not retribution to every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works. Whereas it ſtandeth with equity and juſtice, that well-doers ſhould be rewarded, and evil-doers ſhould be puniſhed; the ſtream runneth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, wicked men ſpeed well, and good men ill: <hi>Naboth</hi> cannot have a poor <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> 
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:47453:95"/>but one rich <hi>Ahab</hi> or other is ready to get it away: <hi>They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>at my people as bread:</hi> and they eat the bread of Gods people: they eate the inheritance of the fatherleſs, and <hi>devour widdows houſes:</hi> ſo that here all is turned topſie-turvey, as if the world were a thing cruciated, tearing it ſelf. If this world ſhould laſt alwayes, where were Gods <hi>juſtice?</hi> And therefore for the manifeſtation of Gods <hi>juſtice and mercy,</hi> there muſt be a day of retribution, when for that portion of ſorrow that the godly have had here, they ſhall have a portion of happineſs and joy; and when for that cup of pleaſure that the wicked have drank here, they ſhall have put into their hands <hi>a cup of trembling and wrath.</hi> If <hi>Dives</hi> enjoy his <hi>good things</hi> here, let him look for a day, when he ſhall be denied a <hi>drop of water:</hi> It <hi>Lazarus</hi> have had his ill things here, let him look when the day ſhall come, that he ſhall be rewarded. Except we will diveſt, and ſtrip God of all his Attributes, deny his <hi>power,</hi> his <hi>wiſdome,</hi> his <hi>truth,</hi> his <hi>juſtice,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> we cannot but confeſs, that certainly there is a day to come, when <hi>God will bring us to judgement.</hi> That is for the firſt. <hi>That the day of Judgement ſhall come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next place we are to conſider,
<note place="margin">2. In what manner it ſhall be.</note> as that it ſhall be, ſo in what manner, and how it ſhall be. Briefly; <hi>the manner of this Judgment,</hi> is ſet forth to us in the Scripture, in five particulars;</p>

<note place="margin">Job. 5.28. Matt. 24.31.1 Cor. 15.</note> This voyce in Scripture is called the <hi>Trump of the Angel; He ſhall ſend his Angels, and they ſhall gather the Elect together, from the four winds,</hi> Mat. 24.31. <hi>The Trump ſhall blow, and the dead ſhall ariſe.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>The Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Archangel, with the Trump of GOD,</hi>

               <p>If we will have the joyful ſound of that voyce then, we muſt welcome the voyce of Chriſt now: God now ſpeaks by men, then by Angels: Now the Trumpet of the Goſpel ſoundeth, then the Trumpet of Judgement ſhall ſound: we muſt learn o bedience to this, and then we ſhall find a great deal of comfort in that: there is a <hi>Surgite</hi> that we muſt hearken to now, ariſe from ſin, <hi>Come unto me all yea that are weary, and heavy laden;</hi> if we hearken to this, we ſhall never fear that <hi>Surgite venite</hi> then, <hi>Ariſe you dead and come to judgement.</hi> That is the firſt.

The <hi>Tares</hi> here muſt be <hi>let alone,</hi> and grow with the <hi>corn,</hi> till the day of harveſt, but yet afterward there ſhall be a diviſion and <hi>a ſeparation:</hi> the wicked and the godly live together here, but at the laſt the wicked ſhall be ſeparated from the godly, like the <hi>chaff</hi> from the <hi>wheat;</hi> as when two travel one way, they paſs together, and lodg together, but the next morning they part, and take ſeveral wayes; ſo the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the godly, after they have been here a time, eating and dirinking, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and living, and perhaps dying, and rotting in the graves together, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding when this day, that I here ſpeak of, ſhall come, then there ſhall be a <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> and diviſion made, then the <hi>ſheep ſhall be ſet on the right hand;</hi> then you ſhall know which is <hi>Jacobs</hi> flock, and which is <hi>Labans:</hi> which belong to Chriſt, and which belong to Sathan, then the <hi>chaff</hi> ſhall be winnowed from the <hi>wheat,</hi> and we ſhall ſee which is for the Barn, and which is for the fire.</p>

<note place="margin">The books that ſhall be opened at the day of Judgment.</note> there are ſome books, by which the works of men are tryed: the book of Nature, the book of Scripture, the book of Conſcience. They that never heard of Chriſt ſhall be judged by the book of Nature: there is enough in the book of Nature to leave all unexcuſable. They that live in the Church, ſhall be tryed, and judged by the book of the Scripture: Of the Law, <hi>They that have ſinned under the the Law, ſhall be judged by the Law:</hi> Of the Goſpel, <hi>God ſhall judg the ſecrets of all hearts according to my Goſpel.</hi> Both of them ſhall be judged according to the book of Conſcience: for God will lay that book ſo clear and open, that they ſhall ſee what they have done againſt that Book. Lord, what a many of ſins have we committed here, that we never remember and think of, when they are done. Our memory and conſcience row is a Book claſped up, we ſee not a thouſand things that are regiſtred there; but when God ſhall lay open that Book, and inlarge our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, and inl ghten our conſciences, then men ſhall clearly ſee what they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got before: they ſhall promptly dictate the whole courſe of our lives, and aquaint us with every action that hath paſt us, and every circumſtance, to accuſe, and excuſe.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter is a ſweet Song of the Prophet, (if I miſtake not) concerning the reſtauration of the <hi>Jews</hi> And the words of the Text, are the ſweet Swan-like Song of our deceaſed Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which ſhe deſired might be her <hi>Funeral Song,</hi> her <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Text,</hi> at this time; and deſired it long ago, before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, that is now fallen out, came to paſs. And I have accordingly pitched upon it: not onely to ſatisfie her deſire in a juſt thing: but eſpecially, becauſe I approve her choice of a fit Text; there being not in the whole Scripture, a portion that will afford a fitter Character (in my apprehenſion) for her perſon: as you ſhall underſtand in the cloſe, to which therefore I ſhall deſer the ſpeaking to the preſent occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:47453:98"/>The truth is I have handled a good part of this chapter formerly, and in this place: but now we ſhall clean go another way than then I did, and than I uſually do. I ſhall only deſire to preſent ſo much one of theſe words without any curious obſervation or diviſion, as may repreſent to us <hi>a perfect character of a ſweet Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-minded man or woman:</hi> which may be of ſingular uſe, and very profitable.</p>
               <p>There be only two things,
<note place="margin">The general things obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the words.</note> that I ſhall obſerve in the whole words? I ſhall but go them over briefly, taking out the main points (as I conceive) for that purpoſe, I ſhall mention them.</p>
               <p>We have here propounded to to us <hi>the compleat duty of a Chriſtian.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. The duty. 2. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> And we have here ſome effectual motives intimated to ſtir Chriſtians up to the preformance of that duty.</p>
               <p>There is <hi>a general duty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The duty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt. 1. Generally. 2.

               <p>The <hi>general duty</hi> (I ſhall not, as I ſaid, handle it in my former way of obſervation, but only explicate the very words of the Text, and that will be enough for me.)
<note place="margin">The general duty expreſſed.</note> The general duty (I ſay) of a Chriſtian, and what ſhould be the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his heart, and ſpirit at all times, we may find expreſſed (at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated) very ſweetly, with ſome excellent directions in the Text, in the ſo th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. In the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> we may ſee here what is the true Object, upon which a Chriſtian ſoul ſhould be fixed.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. In the Acts that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on the Object.</note> we may ſee the Latitude of the Acts which a Chriſtian muſt exerciſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Object.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3.

               <p>Firſt,

                  </gap>am of his whoſe ſoul runs.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. God.</note> I ſay, it ſhould be fixed upon God. We are here in the world placed (as it were) between heaven and earth: Now all the manner is, how our Byas is ſet, which way that turns. As the Byas is of the heart, ſo the man is. Our hearts may be turned downwards to the earth, and to earthly things, and ſo we ſhall run a courſe of ruin and deſtruction: our hearts again, the Byas of them, may be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward heaven, and heavenly things, and ſo we ſhall run the right courſe that we ought. It is God that our ſouls ſhould breath after. <hi>Fecisti nos, Do nine, propter te,</hi> faith a Father: thou haſt made us, O Lord, for thy ſelf, and our ſouls are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs till they return again to thee.</p>
               <p>As they ſay of Circles.
<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The Circle, the round figure, is the moſt perfect figure, and the moſt capacious figure, becauſe there the line that beginneth in one point goeth round, till it return into the ſame again. So this is the greateſt perfection of a man, when he returneth to his beginning: he had all from God, and when he reflects himſelf altogether back again unto God, he attaineth his greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>And indeed there will be no more reſt for the ſoul in any thing out of God, then there is for a ſtone, or a weighty body in the liquid ayre. Hang a ſtone in the Ayre,
<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and do but once remove the force that holds it there, will it, nill it, give but a way to it, and it will cut through, and never reſt, till it come to a ſollid ſubſtance, till it come to the earth, if it may to the Center of the earth. It is ſo with the ſoul of man: try it in all the fortunes, and ſtates, and conditions in the world, as a great Emperour ſaid, I have run through all things, and my ſpirit will reſt in nothing: and as <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth us this obſervation out of all his travel, and experiment that he had made, <hi>Vanity of vanity, all is vanity,</hi> and worſe then vanity too, <hi>vexation of ſpirit: this is the ſum of all; fear God, and keep his commandenents;</hi> as he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:47453:98"/>This is the Object, upon which our ſoul ſhould be ſet, we ſhould have an eye to God; labouring to approve ourſelves to him: making our approaches, and adreſſes, and returns to him; that our ſoul may reſt with him, that we may enjoy the light of his countenance here, and the fulneſs, and brightneſs of his glory hereafter. This is the firſt thing in the Object.</p>
               <p>Now,
<note place="margin">2. The name of Cod.</note> if a ſoul be carried toward this Object, toward God; and we can out-go, and out-grow theſe worldly things, look above them, and look down upon them with ſcorne: then the very <hi>name of God</hi> will be ſweet, and precious to us. <hi>To thee, and to thy name.</hi> Every thing which is a memorial, a remembrance of God, Every thing by which God may be known, will be taken notice of. All his Attributes, his Word, and Ordinances, and all other things which come within the compaſs of his <hi>Name</hi> (as I ſuppoſe there are not many here but know, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary explication of Divines, of the third Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> and the firſt Petition, <hi>hallowed be thy name;</hi> What is meant by the <hi>name of God</hi>) When the heart (I ſay) is ſet upon God, it even will leap for joy at the very <hi>name of God:</hi> the very <hi>name of God</hi> will be ſweet to him. To enjoy God is ſweet, and to have but a glimpſe of him, to have him but repreſented by name, is ſweet too. As it is reported of a Father, that was a godly man, and a Martyr in his time: that he was ſo frequent in roling the name of Chriſt, the name of Jeſusin his mouth, that when he died, it is reported that in his heart there was ingraven, and written, the character of that Name in golden letters. And as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf; <hi>Time was</hi> (faith he) <hi>that I found infinite ſweetneſs, it was honey to me to read a piece of Tully, there was ſo much eloquence in it: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I came to be a Chriſtian, to be acquainted with God, and with Chriſt, then, me thought, the leaves were dry, and the beauty withered; I found no ſuch ſappe, nor relliſh in them.</hi> And he giveth the reaſon: <hi>Becauſe</hi> (faith he) <hi>I did not there find the Name of my bleſſed Lord: they did not bring to my remembrance, they were not Vehicula; inſtruments, to convey to my ſoul, ſomething of my God;</hi> Therefore all that Eloquence vaniſhed, and it was but an empty ſound: like a Cart that runs with ſpeed, rattleth, and makes a great noiſe when it is empty: ſo all the goodly ſound of words, when there is nothing of God carried along with it, that puts us in mind of God, it will have but little ſavour and reliſh to a pious heart. But I muſt not dilate upon things, leſt I prevent my ſelf in what I more intend. This is the firſt thing, that I note here: the <hi>Object</hi> upon which we ſhould place our hearts and ſouls: they ſhould be <hi>toward God, and toward his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then ſecondly,
<note place="margin">The Acts that are exerciſed on the Object.</note> here is intimated in theſe words, nay, and directly expreſt, the <hi>Acts</hi> which a Chriſtian ſhould exerciſe upon the <hi>Object.</hi> There are three <hi>Acts</hi> that are here mentioned: (for the whole ſoul muſt be taken up, and carried with full ſtream toward God in all the parts and faculties of it, and ſo we have it here clearly expreſt.)</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. Of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</note> here is an act of the Underſtanding, the intellectuall faculty mentioned: <hi>Our rememberance is toward thy name.</hi> There is a <hi>remembrance of God and his name.</hi> And this ſhould be one thing which a Chriſtian ſhould take ſpecial care of. Our memories ſhould not be like ſieves,
<note place="margin">Memory.</note> to let out the clear water, and to return the grains and the dreggs: We ſhould not have that treaſury to preſerve rubbiſh, but to preſerve our Jewels: as when there was a diſpute before <hi>Alezander</hi> that great King, concerning a rich Cabinet, that he took among his ſpoils, when he had overthrown <hi>Darius</hi> King of Perſia; the richeſt Cabinet of the moſt coſtly Jewles, that the world had then ſeen: there was a diſpute before him, to what uſe he ſhould put it: and every one having expreſt their minds according as their fancies lead them: the King himſelf concluded, that he would keep that Cabinet to be a treaſury to lay the books of <hi>Homer</hi> in. I am ſure, the richeſt Cabinet that is, is in the ſoul of a man, the memory, which is the treaſure-houſe where we lay up all that we know and learn: it is a rich Cabinet I confeſs, and therefore the fitter for the richeſt Jewel; to lay up the word of God there: as <hi>Mary, treaſured up thoſe things ſhe heard in her heart:</hi> to lay up the <hi>remembrance of God there:</hi> often to think upon God.</p>
               <p>It is a very ſweet ſaying of a learned and godly Father: <hi>A man ſhould oftener <pb n="184" facs="tcp:47453:99"/>remember God, then he doth breath.</hi> As the Common-wealth is maintained by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, and importation of commodities; ſo is our life maintained by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual exportation, and importation of the Ayre, paſſing to and fro: breathing out the Ayre, when it is too hot in us, and fetching it in cool again, to refreſh and ſupply the ſpirits: our life (I ſay) is maintained by it: and God is the very fountaine of life to us: even as the ſoul is the life of the body, ſo is God the life of the ſoul; therefore we ſhould alwayes be remembring of God, ſo oſt as we breath: breathing out prayers to him, or praiſes of him in return of his mercy.</p>
               <p>Our memories (I ſay) ſhould be exerciſed in thinking upon God, in remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God; <hi>Remember thy Creator, in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> faith <hi>Solomon:</hi> We ſhould begin betimes, and we ſhould never be weary of this. The memory is one of the brittleſt parts, and we are moſt apt in age to grow to oblivion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs: as that great Oratour did ſometime, it is reported of him, that his memory (which was incomparably excellent before) failed him ſo much before he died, that he forgat his own name. We cannot forget God, but we muſt be worſe then he, and do that firſt, forget our own name, that we are Chriſtians, that we are ſons and daughters of God. Therefore this ſhould be a thing, that we ſhould often inure our ſelves unto, not to put the thoughts of God from us, or think they are too ſad and ſerious, and ſo to account them as unwelcome gueſts: but we ſhould rather often, bath our ſelves in theſe ſweet delights, in the meditation, and remembrance of God. That is one thing.</p>
               <p>And then ſecondly;
<note place="margin">2. Of the will and affections.</note> beſides the act of the underſtanding (I will go accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the words of the text) there is an act of the will, and of the affections: one onely named as a taſte of all the reſt: for indeed where one is, all are, they are ſo linked and chained together, that they cannot be ſeparate: And here is a ſweet act of affection mentioned; <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is toward thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſhould be one part of a Chriſtians character,
<note place="margin">Deſires.</note> that his deſire ſhould be alwayes breathing out, and flaming up towards heaven: that if he cannot at leaſt obtain the higheſt pitch of full ſayls of love, and of a full perfection in vertue and grace: yet, whatſoever he cometh ſhort in otherwiſe, to make it up with abundant deſires, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent longing deſires, not to come ſhort in that to be ſure: that will make an excel lent ſupply.</p>
               <p>And indeed, it is that, that poor and weak Chriſtians muſt truſt to many times, muſt relieve themſelves with thoughts of: they often find themſelves exceeding ſhort, and defective in performances: if they did not find ſome deſires working in them, there would ſcarſe be any ſymptome of life. As it may be in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: a man can ſee ſometimes, but little motion in the body: ſcarſe any ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of life, the pulſe is very weak and faint, and ſcarſe moveth at all that can be diſcerned: but yet it may be there is ſome kind of breath ſtirring, or elſe we conclude the party dead: ſo it is in this caſe: deſire is that (if there be truth in it, be it the loweſt degree of it) which is an evidence of ſpiritual life: there cannot be truth of grace, where there is not unfeigned, and hearty deſires toward God, deſires to approve our ſelves to him, deſires to walk with him in our whole courſe, deſires to be defective in nothing: and that is in ſome ſort true (as you know Divines have determined it, and if it be not miſ-interpreted, there is a certain truth in it) <hi>the deſire of grace,
<note place="margin">Deſires, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of a gracions heart.</note> is the grace it ſelf:</hi> and the deſire of God, is that which makes ſome union, and giveth us ſome communion and fellowſhip with God. For it is impoſſible that the heart ſhould deſire, and long after God, except it be, that the heart be pointed with love toward God, except the heart love God: for deſire is nothing but a certain configuration of love: Love is the general affection of the ſoul to any thing that is good in all the poſtures of it. Now if it fall out that the good thing I love, be abſent from me, that I have it not in poſſeſſion, then love is ſhaped out, and ſheweth it ſelf in deſires. It muſt needs be therefore, that where there are deſires towards God, and deſires of grace, there is ſomewhat of God formed in that perſon, there is ſomething of grace begun: at leaſt the firſt lineaments thereof are drawn in ſome kind of truth. This is the ſecond Act that Chriſtians ſhould exerciſe, and take ſpecial care to cheriſh: that they have continual pantings, and <pb n="185" facs="tcp:47453:99"/>breathings of deſires toward God: their hearts ſhould work, and beat toward him continually.</p>
               <p>But then in the third place,
<note place="margin">Joyned with endeavours.</note> there is another thing expreſſed in the words of the Text, and that is, theſe deſires are not only (according to our Proverb of wiſhers and woulders) ineffectuall deſires; deſires that are meer gaping, to ſee if the thing will drop into our mouths or no, without any beſtirring of our ſelves; but here is joyned with them (if we peruſe the words of the Text, we ſhall find it) endeavours: <hi>I have deſired thee in the night, and I will ſeek thee early:</hi> the ſoul of a Chriſtian deſires God in the evening, and his ſpirit will ſeek him early in the morning, (for thoſe particulars of the time, I ſhall touch by and by, but now I only take notice of that third diſtinct act here mentioned, which is,) our deſires muſt be joyned with inquiries, with indeavours, to ſearch after God, to ſee if we may grope by any means to find him out, to learn to know what is the way of his good will and pleaſure, how we may lead a life that may be acceptable to him, and how we may come to the poſſeſſion, and aſſurance of his favour, and be accepted in his ſight. Except there be endeavours it is a ſhrewd ſuſpition,
<note place="margin">Deſires with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, falſe.</note> that the deſires are ineffectual deſires, and unformed deſires: and not thoſe that argue any life, and truth of grace. But when our deſires are joyned with theſe beſtirrings of the ſoul, to ſeek after God, to ſearch him out in his Word, in his Ordinances, to find his ſteps, and to find his goings, and ſo to maintaine a ſweet and holy communion with him: that is a ſweet act of Grace, and a certaine ratification, and ſeal of the truth of it.</p>
               <p>But then,
<note place="margin">The manner of exerciſing theſe acts.</note> let me add the third thing. In what height are all theſe actions to be boyled up? or in what manner muſt we tender theſe ſervices to God in this kind? How muſt our underſtandings lay hold upon God, and treaſure him up in our memories? How muſt our affections and deſires work toward him? how muſt our endeavours be carried toward God? The manner of all theſe will make this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and ſo make up the full and compleat <hi>Character of a Chriſtian,</hi> in this general duty.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. They muſt come from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principles</note> the ſoul muſt be carried intimately, and moſt inwardly: the inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and workings of the ſoul and ſpirit muſt be toward God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet here expreſſeth theſe acts, as the acts of the very ſoul and ſpirit of a man.</p>
               <p>All outward actions of ſeeking toward God, and making our approaches and addreſſes toward him, they are all ſuch as may be counterfeited, a hypocrite may act them. There is nothing in the world, no ſhape of any external thing in the world; but a Painter with his Penſil can draw the picture of it, give a reſemblance of the thing: and there is no outward action in the world, that belongeth to God, or to Chriſtianity, but it is poſſible for a Painter, for a baſe hypocrite to repreſent them with an artificiall penſil. But the inward acts of life, that no Painter can imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate: a Painter cannot make a picture to have heart, and entrailes, and lunges, to have life and motion, and ſpirits, and bloud ſtirring in the veines: all thoſe things a Painter cannot imitate; he can make ſhapes, but he cannot put the life into them: he can make outward formes, but he cannot put the inwards to them. Now then this is that intended here: all thoſe outward actions muſt be animated actions: not dead actions, actions that have no further bottome then the teeth out wards, that grow upon the houſe top: a word growing upon the tip of the tongue, that hath no root in the heart, and ſo for the reſt. But they muſt have the root in the heart and ſoul of a man; that muſt inwardly be carried towards God. And when the heart and ſoul, and ſpirit of a man (all which words are here uſed) by a ſupernatural grace that is implanted in them, when (I ſay) they are thus carried toward God, it is an argument of ſpiritual life; that there is ſome life.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. They muſt he ſincere.</note> they muſt be carried ſincerely, not for any by, or baſe reſpects. When a man makes toward any perſon or thing, and profeſſes love to it: and doth it not for the thing it ſelf, but for ſome by end; he doth not love that perſon he makes to, but he loveth that thing for whom he makes to that perſon. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simile.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:47453:100"/>A man ſcrapeth and croucheth, and keeps a do with a man, that he never ſaw or knew, one that he is ready, it may be (when his back is turned) to curſe: but yet he will do this for his almes, for his gain, to make a prey, a uſe of him ſome way: this man loveth his almes, loveth his prey, loveth his bounty: but it is no argument of love to the man. So it is in this caſe: for a man to make toward God, and to ſeem to own him, and to be one of the generation of thoſe that <hi>ſeek his face,</hi> to addreſs himſelf in outward confotmity, and many other things, by which another may charitably (if he have no other ground) judge of him: all this is nothing, except a man may diſcern ſomething that may give him a taſte, that his ſpirit doth uprightly, and ſincerely ſeek God; that he loveth God, for God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that he loveth grace, for grace it ſelf; he loveth the Commandements of God, becauſe they are Gods commandements, and becauſe they are beautiful, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of his Word. But otherwiſe, if it be any ſiniſter thing, that carrieth a man on toward God, it is no argument of the life, and truth of grace. You know it is ſo in experience: there be many things that move, and yet their motion is no argument of life:
<note place="margin">Simile.</note> A wind-mill, when the wind ſerveth, moveth, and moveth very nimbly too: yet you do not ſay preſently that that is a living creature: No, it moveth only by an external cauſe, by an artificial contrivance; it is ſo framed, that when the wind ſetteth in ſuch and ſuch a corner, it will move, and ſo having but an external Moter, and cauſe to move, and no inward principle, no ſoul within it to move it, it is an argument that it is no living creature. So it is here: if a man ſee another move, and move very faſt, in thoſe things which of themſelves are the wayes of God, ſee him move as faſt to hear a Sermon as his neighbour doth; is as forward and haſty to thruſt himſelf, and bid himſelf a gueſt to the Lords Table, (when God hath not bid him) as any; the Queſtion is, what principle ſets him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work: if it be an inward principle of life, out of a ſincere affection, and love to God and his ordinances that carrieth him to this: it argueth that man hath ſome life of grace, But if it be ſome wind that bloweth him on; the wind of State, the wind of Law, the wind of danger, of penalty, the wind of faſhion or cuſtome, to do as his neighbours do: if theſe or ſuch like, be the things that draw him thither; this is no argument of life at all: it is a cheap thing, it is counterfeit, and poor ware.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. They muſt be pitched on God alone.</note> (that which I have often ſaid to be the principal, and the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing (that I know) in all practical Divinity, and which is the moſt Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ariſtical, of the truth of Grace, and of the life of Piety in any one) our ſpirits, and ſouls, and affections towards God, muſt be advanced to this hieght: to be carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, above all other things.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you ſeriouſly think of it: I have often ſpoken of it, but it may be there may be ſome room left for the mention of it now, and ſome neceſſity of pondering it well. It will be the Charactariſtical thing, by which a man may moſt certainly diſcern himſelf. And I would deſire to know wherein my defect of underſtanding is, if I be miſtaken: but it ſeems to me as a clear thing, that every one here, that hath not a mind to affront the mind of God, he dares not conteſt this argument, that it is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional thing, that if God be the beſt of Beings, he ſhould have the beſt portion in our love.</p>
               <p>All reaſon commands us to love that beſt, which is beſt: and to diſpenſe our love according to the degree of the excellency of the thing. There is no man but apprehendeth this clearly. A man may ſay that he loves his Wife, and he will prove it: and this ſhall be his argument, I love her aſwell, as I do another woman: Is this the proof of conjugall love? was this the covenant made between them? hath he fulfilled it in this caſe to her? or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to him? There is no man but ſeeth that there is more required: there is a peculiarity, and propriety of love required in this caſe. It muſt certainly be ſo here; for we contract and eſpouſe our ſouls to Chriſt, and upon thoſe very terms, for better, and for worſe, to forſake all the world, and to cleave to him alone: and if our ſpirits be not raiſed and advanced to that degree of affection, that Chriſt and God be ſo lovely, and beautiful, in our eyes, and ſo good (for I name one ſometime, and ſometime another, it is all one <pb n="187" facs="tcp:47453:100"/>upon the point) if (I ſay) they be not advanced thus high: the conjugal knot was never tyed between Chriſt and the ſoul: it is impoſſible therefore that ſuch a one ſhould have to plead the benefits that flow from a Conjugal union: neither can he have title or right to any thing that iſſueth from a marriage with Chriſt, whoſe ſoul did but equivocate, and would never ſpeak out the words, and who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver anſwered the interrogations of a good conſcience (as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe) that when the ſoul (in the contract) ſhould ſay, that ſhe takes him for to love, and honour, and obey him, and to make him her Lord and Saviour: if the ſoul do not yeeld to this, which it cannot do, if it do not eſteem him the beſt of all others, and that all others are to be thrown away, and to be forſaken in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him. This is the third circumſtance I have noted hence, which I ſuppoſe is intimated in theſe words: Though I have not ſaid it is expreſt here, yet it is ſo carryed with ſuch a fulneſs (<hi>the deſire of our ſoul is to thee, and to the remembrance of thy name</hi>) as if it were to God only, or at leaſt, to him principally. But I muſt haſten.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place.
<note place="margin">4, They muſt be univerſal.</note> It muſt be univerſal love, and ſo a univerſal obedience (which is the fruit of it) which muſt juſtifie the truth of our affections towards God, and ſet the heart in a right frame and temper. Except a man love God, and love all the wayes of God, and all the ordinances of God, and yeeld himſelf in ſubjection, and reſign himſelf in obedience to them all: if he do but reſerve, and make choyce of any one ſin, to lye and wallow, and tumble in, he doth evacuate all the other good, he throweth down all the other good with that one evil. Will you come and plead with God, that there is but one ſin that you have defiled and polluted your ſoul with, and wallowed and tumbled in all your life, and I hope, God will never refuſe me, or bar me out of his preſence, and fellowſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him for that? Yes, you are as filthy, all over as filthy and defiled, and abominable, and odious to his eye, and to every other ſenſe, aſwel with one, as if you had been in ten thouſand ſlowghes one after another. And as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſpeaks, a Cup, or ſome ſuch thing, that hath a hole in it, is no Cup, it will hold nothing, and therefore cannot performe the uſe of a cup, though it have but one hole in it: ſo if the heart have but one hole in it; if it retain the divel but in one thing: as we uſe to ſay; in law, one man in poſſeſſion, keeps poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a man can never have true poſſeſſion, till he have voyded all: ſo, except all be rooted out and extirpated, and a man cometh to yeeld a full and abſolute ſubjection to Chriſt univerſally, Chriſt hath no part or portion in us, nor we in him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">5. They muſt be conſtant.</note> (there were divers other particulars, that I thought to have added in this: but I ſee I muſt paſs them over) It is not every affection, that may ſeem to have ſome height and univerſality, though I do acknowledg that they will in ſome meaſure characteriſe out the truth, but yet there muſt be this addition: as it was with the ſeed that was caſt into the good ground, it had depth of earth: ſo this muſt have depth in the heart, it muſt be well rooted, and faſtned for perpetuity: it muſt be a conſtant aſſection,
<note place="margin">Simile.</note> grounded and eſtabliſhed in the heart. The Ayre (you know) is light, and yet we call it not a lightſome body, becauſe it is lighted by the preſence of another, and when that light body is removed it is dark, you may ſay it is dark, for the Ayre is dark in the night, when the Sun is abſent, as it is light when the Sun is preſent: thoſe we call lightſome bodyes, whoſe light is origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and rooted in themſelves. So it is in this caſe: ſuch are not godly perſons that may have ſome injections of godly thoughts, and godly affections caſt into them, and be in them for a ſpurt, and for a brunt, and for a little flaſh (like a flaſh of lightning in the Ayre) and gone away again preſently: but it muſt be rooted and grounded in a man, ſo as that it will continue, continue ſo as that the exerciſe of graces and duties toward God ſhould be frequent and quotidian: as it is here in the Text: <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thee, in the evening, and our ſpirit ſhall ſeek thee early in the morning:</hi> Morning and evening, frequently, daily, to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and communion with God, to walk with him, to ſet our ſelves in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and to approve our ſelves to him, to make it our conſtant trade to do ſo, <pb n="188" facs="tcp:47453:101"/>to be Gods dayes-men, to work by the day with him, and withal to be conſtant to hold out for perpetuity.</p>
               <p>Only time can diſcover truth; and truth is the daughter of time to us: God knoweth it before, but we can never know, but by the holding out, but by the perpetuity. I acknowledg there is a great difference between that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth temporary faith, and that which it calleth ſaving faith: there is (I ſay) a great difference: they do not only differ in this, that the one holdeth out, and the other doth not hold out: but they differ in their vital principles, by vertue of which one holdeth out, becauſe it hath a more noble nature in it: and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe it is a ſlighter timbered thing, it doth not hold out: becauſe the one is a real, and true, and ſubſtantial beauty of grace, the other but a ſuperficial and painted beauty: ſubſtantial beauty, that is founded upon nature, upon our complexion, whether it rain or ſhine, it will hold out in both: but painted beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, one fears a little wet will alter the painting, another, leſt a little heat ſhould do it. A painted beauty will not hold, but true will hold. And they that do love true, love long, as our Proverb ſaith: I am certain it is ſo here, they who do once love God truly, love God for ever.</p>
               <p>I will diſpatch the reſt in a word.
<note place="margin">The particular duties.</note> There be ſome ſpecial duties, beſides theſe generals, which make the general character of a Chriſtian: I ſay, there are ſome ſpecial duties, that do concern him according to the ſpeciallity of times.</p>
               <p>Now there is a double time, and ſo a double poſture of a Chriſtian, in which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he hath ſeveral ſuits of graces to put on, and to exerciſe.</p>
               <p>There is a double dealing of God (which is the foundation of it) God dealeth ſometime in a way of mercy and favor toward his ſervants: and God dealeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in a way of Judgment, and wrath, and diſpleaſure: and he doth ſo, (though not as an angry Judg, but as a father that is angry) even with his own ſervants.</p>
               <p>Now accordingly,
<note place="margin">In times of mercy. 1. Chearfulneſs 2. Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> as this general temper, and frame of ſpirit, ſhould be at all times; ſo it ſhould ſhew and diſcover it ſelf, in thoſe ſeveral times. In the time when God ſheweth favour, then the ſervant of God is to ſerve God ſo much the more chearfully, and ſo much the more fruitfully; <hi>to run the wayes of Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> becauſe God inlargeth his way; and giveth him free ſcope, and more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and advantages for it: and to improve thoſe favours for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glory that gave them.</p>
               <p>But the particular thing that is eſpecially expreſt here (though that be intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too,
<note place="margin">In times of judgment.</note> and it is noted as a character here of a wicked ſpirit, <hi>that they will do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly in the land of uprightneſs:</hi> that is, in the land where God dealeth very gently, and gratiouſly, and uprightly with them every way, and ſquarely, that they can no way complain; it is a wicked ſpirit that doth ſo.) But that which is ſpecially meant here (<hi>in the way of thy judgments will we wait for thee</hi>) is, that Gods ſervants will not only, not ſtart (if their temper be right) from God when he ſmiles upon them; but they will love him when he frowneth, they will even then ſtoop and kiſs the rodd, they will then obey him: Gods children will acknowledg him to be their Father and Lord, and ſubmit to him, even when he is angry.</p>
               <p>Here is a vaſt difference between the godly and the wicked,
<note place="margin">Simile.</note> (as I ſhall a little touch by and by.) As the Father ſpeaks even to this very purpoſe: when ſweet oyntment is chaſed, it ſmells the more ſweet, it delivereth the perſume the more excellent; but in a dunghill, in a filthy place, ſtir it, and the more you ſtir, the more it ſtinks. Wicked ſpirits, when God doth but chafe them, manifeſt the filth and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is within them; as a man may know money (as he ſaith) when it falleth down, whether it be ſilver or braſs, it will then betray it ſelf: ſo here, their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>their ſpeech will betray them then,</hi> and declare what they are. The divel thought that <hi>Job</hi> had been of ſuch a temper, that he would have curſt <hi>God to his face,</hi> if he would lay his hand upon him, and touch him: but it was far otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was of a better mettal and ſtamp, therefore he bleſſed God in the middeſt of judgment, as he had done formerly in the middeſt of his mercies. And this is that a Chriſtian ſhould do: labour to be fruitful in thankfulneſs, and chearfulneſs of ſpirit, when God ſheweth favour, and give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> any eaſe, and mercy to him; and <pb n="189" facs="tcp:47453:101"/>labour likewiſe to be faithful and conſtant to him, even when his judgments are a broad.</p>
               <p>But there be divers particulars in that, (I will but meerly mentich them.) There be theſe ſour things, as ſo many ſleps and degrees of the duty of a Chriſtian in the times of Judgment, whether they be impendant, or incombent, whether they be publick, or private, that concern the Church, or particular perſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all,
<note place="margin">1. Perſeverance</note> the duty of a Chriſtian in the times of Judgment (if he be of a right temper) is Perſeverance, to hold out, not to be beaten off for a little ſtorm or ſhock, but to keep on his pace, to keep on his way.</p>
               <p>Travellers that go to ſea:
<note place="margin">Simile.</note> meerly to be ſick a little, or in ſport, if there ariſe but a black cloud, they preſently give over, their voyage is at an end; they come not to venture ſhocks, and ſtorms, and danger; they come for pleaſure: but the Merchant, that is bound upon a voyage, whoſe trade and imployment of life it is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very cloud and wind, doth not make him to return back again to ſhoare, and to give over; but he goeth them through: ſo it is in this caſe, one that is not indeed and in earneſt travelling toward heaven, he will be eaſily off upon a little ſtorm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing; if God do but frown, if there be but a wrinckle in his brow: all his pleaſure in religion is gone, for it was ſome other things he aymed at, it was but for pleaſure he came in here: but a godly Chriſtian who is bound for heaven, whoſe voyage is ſet for heaven, and his courſe and the bent of his ſoul lyeth that way, that like a Ship with full Sail is carried toward heaven: ſtorms will not beat him off, but he will perſevere.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. Diligent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our graces.</note> there is a neceſſary uſe (as there ſhould be perſeverance, ſo) that there ſhould be a kind of excellency and precellency of all holy duties (which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the general before) which a man ſhould exerciſe ſo much the more induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly and painfully in ſtorms and difficulties. All ſweet odours are refreſhing to the head at any time,
<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but when there is a ſtinking place that is offenſive, men hold them cloſer to them: ſo it ſhould be with all the graces of Gods Spirit, with all holy duties, they ſhould be pretious to us at all times; but ſpecially in times of ſtreſs and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Oh then we ſhould cleave cloſe to them, then multiply in prayers, then multiply in our holy walking with God, then multiply examining diligently our wayes, and looking more ſtrictly and narrowly to our ſelves; then we ſhould reflect more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon our lives, and then we ſhould excel our ſelves: or elſe it will not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail, and be an Antidote againſt the evil and bitterneſs of the times.</p>
               <p>Thirdly there ſhould be ſhewed patience in the time of affliction,
<note place="margin">3. Patience.</note> in the time of Gods Judgment: we ſhould not mutter againſt God, nor ſtruggle, nor be violent againſt him: but humbly and meekly lay our ſelves down before him. <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good in his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Laſtly,
<note place="margin">4. Proſiciency</note> there ſhould be a proficiency: that the <hi>inhabitants of the earth will learn righteouſneſs:</hi> we ſhould patiently wait upon God in the way of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and withall we ſhould be good proficients, then to learn righteouſneſs. Gods rod ſhould be to us as the feſcue is to the child, the feſcue points out to the child the letter, makes him take notice of it: and ſo Gods rod points out many good leſſons which we ſhould never otherwiſe learn and take notice of. I had never known (as <hi>Luthers</hi> wife ſaid ſometime) what ſuch and ſuch things meant, in ſuch and ſuch Pſalmes, ſuch complaints and workings of ſpirit; I had never underſtood the practiſe of our duty, if God had not brought me under ſome affliction: afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a Commentary, and feſcue to point out my leſſon to me; and by that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
               <p>Let me but mention one thing more in a word,
<note place="margin">The Motives to the duties.</note> (I ſhall leave the Application, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am prevented.) Here is now the ſum of a Chriſtians duty, which I have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to you, out of the words of the verſes read: partly general duties that belong to all Chriſtians in all times: and partly ſome particular duties which concern them more ſpecially in ſome ſpecial times. There is a motive or two to preſs and ſtir us up to the performance of theſe duties. There is one in a verſe before thoſe I have read, (the ſeventh verſe) <hi>The way of the juſt is uprightneſs: thou moſt upright doſt weigh the path of the juſt.</hi> Here the firſt Motive is from the conſideration of God. <pb n="190" facs="tcp:47453:102"/>God is a holy overſeer of all our wayes;
<note place="margin">God ſeeth and Judgeth all our wayes.</note> a ſpectatour of all our carriage and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, how we do carry our ſelves, and approve our ſelves to him. God is not only a ſpectatour, and an overſeer of our wayes, but he is an expencer, a weigher and Judg-of our wayes; to reward every man according to his works: and we ſhould often caſt our eyes to God, and ſee him looking upon us in our carriages, to put ſome more awe upon our ſpirits, that we may not wantonly break out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, not daring to do evil in the preſence of that holy God which one day we know, we muſt be brought to account for, at the great Judgment. But I can but name it.</p>
               <p>There is a ſecond Motive in the cloſe,
<note place="margin">1. This alone differenceth the godly from the wicked.</note> in thoſe words which ſtand laſt of thoſe I read, and a verſe following. And that is from men, from the particular proper character of a Chriſtian: it is that which differenceth a godly man from a wicked man. Herein lies the difference of their temper, and of their ſpirit: the godly man, he is deſcribed already what his carriage is, that is his carriage, which is here lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out in the Prophets own expreſſion, in their name: but the wicked men they are clean otherwiſe, they do not perform theſe duties; neither the general, nor the particular.</p>
               <p>Now it bohoveth every one to take care to <hi>depart from the tents of thoſe wicked men;</hi> that ſhall be ſwallowed up, and go down quick to hell every one (as it was in the caſe of <hi>Korah.</hi>) It is the command of God that they ſhould depart and ſever themſelves, and make as broad and vaſt a difference, and be jealous, and take heed leſt they aſſimulate themſelves to wicked men in their lives, leſt they be like unto them in their deaths: that they live not as they do, leſt they periſh as they do.</p>
               <p>Now, there be two or three things that are expreſt concerning theſe wicked men.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, their Character is to be refractary to God in what way ſoever he ſhewes himſelf to them: if he ſhew his favour, or ſend his Judgments it is all one: <hi>in the land of uprightneſs, they will do wickedly, and when Gods hand is lifted up, they will not ſee:</hi> nothing will do them good: no way of working upon them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by fair, nor by foul means. And we muſt be unlike them therefore every way; we muſt take every dealing of God by the right care (as he ſaid) and make the right uſe of it for good.</p>
               <p>There is another thing expreſt of them: that God will one day meet with theſe wicked men: let no man deceive himſelf: it is not a vain thing to ſerve God: nor a cheap, nor a ſafe thing to rebel againſt God, for his hand ſhall be lifted up, and he will break them in peeces, and the longer he ſpareth, and the gentler he is, the more heavy it will come at laſt. Gods Mill grindeth ſlow, but it grinds to powder (as the ancient ſaying is) the more God is long-ſuffering, and long lifting up his hand to lay his ſtroak, the heavier ſtroak he layes upon them, and cruſheth all to peeces at laſt.</p>
               <p>But there is another thing too: even thoſe wicked men that are ſo ſtubborn and refractary, and ſcorn Gods word: that lift up the heel and kick againſt him, and it may be ſcoff and jear, and deride the wayes of God; time ſhall come that even theſe wicked men ſhall be convinced, they ſhall ſee their envy againſt the godly, and hatred againſt the wayes of God, they ſhall ſee their foolery, and they ſhall at laſt repent, when repentance ſhall do them no good: repent, when they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven turned into hell, when they hear that ſentence; <hi>Depart from me you curſed.</hi> Therefore now ſeeing theſe things will befall the rebellious, that do not walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule, according to this Canon which I have characteriſed a godly man by: this ſhould be a good incouragement to godly men ſo much the more to walk conſtantly, and to be true to their own way. And if they do live amongſt wicked men, to be rather gainers by them, to grow the better rather then to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and corruption from them.</p>
               <p>They ſay that Lillies and Roſes, or ſuch like things, if they be planted by Garlick or Onions, or ſuch like unſavoury things, they do increaſe in ſweeneſs: the Roſe and the Lillie are ſweeter: ſo it ſhould be when godly men are planted, and <pb n="191" facs="tcp:47453:102"/>hemmed about with wicked men: the vileneſs and odiouſneſs of their wicked wayes, may make them to loath wickedneſs the more, and to love godlineſs, and to bleſs God, that hath kept them, that they have not run to the ſame exceſs of ryot with them.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of all other Application which I thought to have added, as for example, and for inſtance: to ſhew us the true Analogie of a Chriſtian; that we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, who is a right Chriſtian, and who is not: we muſt not diſcern it by our fancies, but by thoſe Characters God hath ſet.</p>
               <p>And a juſt apology (in the ſecond place) for thoſe that are branded with nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names. If this be the deſcription of true piety, and of a true Chriſtian, to have the heart and ſoul breathing after God, and ſeeking night and day after him, and ſetting themſelves wholly to walk in the way of uprightneſs, with ſincerity before God: then certainly they are unjuſtly branded, whoſe conſciences do aime at theſe things, and the conſciences of other men may tell them, that they do ſo, and they ſee no other.</p>
               <p>And ſo for conviction of thoſe men that are in the Boſome of the Church: they may ſee, if they be not according to this ſtamp: if they either fail of it, that there is none of theſe lineaments to be found in them, nothing toward God and his name, no underſtanding, no affection, no endeavours working that way, (and ſo for the reſt) if they utterly fail of this, they utterly come ſhort, and are not worthy the name of Chriſtians: but much more if they do deride, and oppoſe, and contemne the mind, and the wayes of God, which God hath chalked out to us, for our rule and direction: that is a high degree of fayling and coming ſhort, and therefore they may be convinced, that they cannot be right: I doubt when the Books ſhall be opened, and every one judged according to the book of God, which ſhall be laid for the tryal of our lives: if our lives be not according to that: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our words be, and howſoever we carry it, it will not beare us out then.</p>
               <p>And it might have been a Uſe alſo of Examination; let every one of us examin our ſelves, and what our eſtate is according to this rule, and what degree of this we have attained to.</p>
               <p>And then for comfort, for thoſe that are ſuch according to this rule, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in the perfection, or in the affection. If they have not the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet if there affections ſtand and run this way, and that they can truly, and ingeniouſly ſay, that they are ſuch in ſincerity; there is a great deal of comfort for them.</p>
               <p>And for Exhortation, out of the ſeveral branches of the duty which I cannot med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with. And out of the ſeveral Motives that I propounded out of the words of the Text.</p>
               <p>But (I ſay inſtead of all theſe, this preſent Siſter of ours, whoſe Funeral we now ſolemnize, I might ſetch an Argument as a Motive to all theſe ſeveral duties from her example.</p>
               <p>To return now therefore to the preſent occaſion.</p>
               <p>I will ſpeak ſomething concerning Her, in honour of whoſe Funeral ſolemnities, we are at this time met together, (that gave us the occaſion) I ſhall (according to my cuſtome) diſpatch it briefly.</p>
               <p>When any children of God die, the laſt offices of Love are performed to them by three ſeveral ſorts or ranks. The Angels: they convey their ſouls into the <hi>boſome of their father Abraham,</hi> into the bliſſe of eternity. The Bearers, attended with the Mourners: they carry their bodies to the boſome of their mother earth, to reſt in tranquility. The Preachers (as it were a middle between God and them) they commend their name to the minds of their friends, the hearers, to live in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories. My part at the preſent is to do this: and I ſhall do it, not ſo much to trumpet out her commendation, as to take a hint of ſomething for your inſtruction, which may be uſeful.</p>
               <p>But I muſt intreat you to remember, that you do not uſe to lace or adorn your mournings: and therefore you have little reaſon to expect, any eloquent adorning, <pb n="192" facs="tcp:47453:103"/>any Feſtival ornament in ſuch a Funeral argument. My language muſt be black, and pathetical, ſutable to our ſad occaſion: it muſt not be pleaſing to the fancy in the freſh flowers of Rhetorick; my language (I ſay) muſt be in black, but in black laid upon a ground of truth, which ſhall not bluſh for blame, ſpeaking any thing beſides, what I do really conceive. As I dare not do you ſo much wrong, as to paint or guild a rotten poſt: ſo I am willing to do her ſo much right, as to ſet a rich Pearl in Gold.</p>
               <p>To paſs other circumſtances, (as that ſhe was deſcended of an honeſt, and worthy Family, and of good quality: that She had a full and hopeful iſſue deſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her ſelf, and ſuch like circumſtances, which I leave for Oratours (as unfit for a Divine) to meddle withal.) All that I ſhall ſay concerning Her, ſhall be out of the Text, in which you may behold a true picture of her in all the lineaments of her: and out of it, you may be able to draw, and take a good pattern for your ſelves.</p>
               <p>The Byas of her ſpirit was <hi>toward God, and toward his Name;</hi> whoſe lively Image ſhe bare, graven in her memory, living in her deſires, and (beyond all pictures) moving alſo in her endeavours to ſeek after God. The very quinteſcence of her ſpirit was carried this way, and that <hi>intimately, ſincerely, univerſally, and conſtantly. With her ſoul ſhe deſired him in the night, and with her ſpirit ſhe ſought him in the morning:</hi> the light of the morning, and the evening ſtar (as ſometime the Star did the Wiſe men) conducted her to the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſs.</hi> In mercies ſhe was not wanton, but thankful and fruitful: In judgements (as in a fatherly way of correction, She had a deep ſhare, wherein being exerciſed with many years weakneſs, as thoſe that knew her, knew very well, but yet in ſuch fatherly dealings) ſhe ſhewed her <hi>patience,</hi> her <hi>perſeverance,</hi> her <hi>proſiciency:</hi> and being a Mourner for the ſtobbornneſs of the wicked, ſhe was a gainer likewiſe by them too: and all becauſe ſhe looked up to God, who ſees and weighs all our paths. In which I have briefly recollected upon the matter, the ſum of the whole things contained in the text: ſo that ſo long as this Text is in the Bible, and ſo long as the Bible is in the Church, and ſo long as any thing (though unworthy) of this Sermon remaines in your memories, ſhe cannot want either a ſweet memorial of her vertues in the book of God, or a ſtately Monument in the Church, and in your hearts too.</p>
               <p>Happily ſome may ſcoffe, and ſome may doubt, as though this commendation flew too high, or out of ſight. To whom I ſhall briefly anſwer both. For the former. It is reported of two great Tragedians, learned and famous in their time: <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Euripides. Euripides</hi> preſented upon the Scaene all naughty women: and <hi>Sophocles</hi> preſented all vertuous women: and the ordinary obſervation of the wits of the times was (as men are apt to be vainly witted in theſe things) they thought that <hi>Euripides</hi> that preſented them bad, preſented women as they were: and <hi>Sophocles</hi> that preſented them good, preſented them as they ſhould be. If I had nothing elſe to ſay to the ſcoffs of any, but only this, I ſuppoſe it will be ſufficient: I do beleeve fully, that I have preſented her as ſhe was: but howſoever you can take no hurt if you do but conſider, that it is ſpoken as what you ſhould be. I am ſure, and I know I have preſented what you ſhould be.</p>
               <p>And for any that ſhall doubt yet, that it may ſeem to high. I would deſire them only to conſider this: I deſcribe in the Text, the very temper and character of one that is truly godly (ſuch as I conceive her to have been) and the truth is, there is none that is truly godly, but in ſome degree or meaſure muſt attain, and do attain to participate in a conformity with this Character: and therefore I have neither done you (as I conceive) any wrong, and yet done her right too. And (to draw to an end,) She hath left this honour behind her, that ſhe lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and died deſired.</p>
               <p>And, who is there here almoſt that ſuffereth not a loſs in her? Her Husband hath loſt a loving wife that honoured him highly. Her children have loſt a loving Mother, that loved them tenderly, that tendered them duly. Her ſervants have loſt a loving Miſtreſs, that governed them gently, and was every way beneficial to them. Her <pb n="193" facs="tcp:47453:103"/>Brothers and Siſters, have loſt a loving Siſter, that anſwered them in their loves ſweetly. Her Neighbours have loſt a loving neighbour: full of courteſie to the rich, full of charity to the poor. And my ſelf have loſt (I hope there is none here ſo weak to ſuſpect, that I blaſt the living, to blazon the praiſe of the dead, or that I do rob or ſtrip the living, to cloath the dead with their ſpoyles, but I think I may truly ſay, I have loſt) as truly and cordially a loving friend, as any ſhe hath left behind: though I eſteem many her Peeres, and I cannot complain of any.</p>
               <p>But to end all. Her gain in Chriſt countervaileth and ſweetneth all our loſſes. She was a diſciple of Love, ſhe loved her Lord, and loved all his Saints and ſervants: and therefore I doubt not, that ſhe was a beloved diſciple, and reſteth in the boſome of her Love: where not to diſquiet her happineſs, and detain your patience any longer, I ſhall leave her in that bleſſed place, and commend you to the bleſſing of God.</p>

                     <p>For our Converſation is in Heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working, whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the ſeventh verſe of this Chapter, the bleſſed Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> exhorteth the Philippians, <hi>to be followers together of him, and to mark them which walk ſo as they had him for an enſample:</hi> And that he might the better direct them in the duty, (the imitation of his enſample) he ſheweth that there is a great difference between others that pretended themſelves to be the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and indeed were not, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <hi>Many</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are the enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly; and whoſe glory is their ſhame, who mind earthly things.</hi> Theſe enſamples he would have them to avoid: follow not ſuch, <pb n="196" facs="tcp:47453:105"/>but <hi>be ye followers of us, for our converſation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and follow thoſe which walk, ſo as ye have us for an enſample:</hi> This is the example he would have them imitate.</p>
               <p>In the words you have theſe things conſiderable.</p>
               <note place="margin">Diviſion of the words.</note>
               <p>Firſt, What the <hi>converſation</hi> of theſe men was, whom the Apoſtle would have the Philipians to follow. Their <hi>converſation</hi> was a heavenly <hi>converſation. Our converſation is in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the reaſon or incouragement that they had to this imitation, to walk ſo heavenly, while they were on earth: becauſe <hi>from thence we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the benefit by that <hi>Saviour, whom they look for from heaven: He ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like to his glorious body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the means by which this great work ſhall be effected; <hi>According to the working whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, (to touch it only in a word) there is from that, theſe two Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations clearly ariſing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That there is a heavenly converſation of the Saints on earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That while they are on earth, they are now ſtated in heaven. Our converſation is in heaven:</hi> He ſaith not only it ſhall be <hi>in heaven,</hi> (though there it ſhall be perfected) but <hi>it is now in heaven,</hi> in regard of our preſent ſtate and poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1. The Saints on earth have a heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</note> that <hi>the Saints on earth have a heavenly converſation.</hi> You muſt know, that the word here <hi>Politeuma,</hi> tranſlated <hi>converſation,</hi> ſignifieth ſuch a courſe of life, and of traffique, as is in Cities and Corporations, where many are knit, and united together in one common ſociety, in one common freedome: <hi>Our converſation is in heaven;</hi> that is, we have a kind of heavenly traffique, a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trade, while we are upon earth.</p>
               <p>There are divers things wherein there is an agreement between the carriages and conditions of men in Cities,
<note place="margin">What it is.</note> and Societies here on earth, and this of the Saints of God,
<note place="margin">The priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thereof.</note> that have <hi>their converſations in heaven.</hi> I will only in brief run them over, this being not the thing that I purpoſely aym at.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. Their names are written in heaven.</note> in Cities and Corporations there is a Regiſter, wherein the names of the Free-men are inrolled. So in heaven alſo there is a Regiſter, a certain book of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords (as it were) wherein are written the names of as many, as God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to life:
<note place="margin">Luk. 10.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Rejoce not</hi> (faith our Saviour) <hi>in this, that the divels are ſubdued unto you, but rejoyce, that your names are written in heaven:</hi> And <hi>all that are not found written in the book of life, are caſt into the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone,</hi> Rev. 20.15. God in his ſecret counſel and purpoſe, in his ſpecial providence and love, takes notice of all his ſervants, even of their names, and he hath them as ſure, as if they were written down in a book, there is not one man that cometh to heaven, but the Lord knows him already to be a man ordained to that eſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. They are governed by the law of God.</note> as in all Cities and Societies, there is a certain law whereby they are all governed, in obedience to which they live. So there is a law whereby all the Citizens of heaven, all the <hi>houſhold of God</hi> are governed, that law which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>James</hi> calleth <hi>the royal law:</hi> a law which commandeth the very ſpirits of men: a law that diſpoſeth the whole man to a heavenly frame, and ſubjection to the will of God, the great King of Heaven; ſo that a man while he is here below, by degrees is drawn off from the world in his affections, and diſpoſition, and carriage: and madeſutable and conformable to the rule of righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. They are ſafety kept.</note> as in all Cities, there is a kind of ſafety and ſecurity to thoſe that dwell there, not only as they are incompaſſed with walls, but alſo as there is watching and warding, ſome waking while others ſleep to keep the reſt in ſafety. So in this heavenly ſociety: <hi>the Angels pitch their Tents about thoſe that fear God:</hi> nay <hi>the Lord</hi> himſelf <hi>is the Shepheard of Iſrael, that neither ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth:</hi> while men oppoſe them, God defends them: while men are labouring and plotting, and deviſing againſt them, and they (it may be) are ſecure and fear no danger; God <pb n="197" facs="tcp:47453:105"/>diſperſeth and diſappointeth a thouſand projects intended againſt his ſervants. It was ſo with his own people Iſrael: while they were in the plains, ſecurely lying in their tents: there is <hi>Balack</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> conſulting upon the mountains how to curſe them: but the God of Iſrael that is above the mountains, that ſitteth on the higheſt Heavens, he ordereth the matter ſo, that <hi>Balaam</hi> for his life, (though he might have had all the wealth and honour of the Kingdome) could not pronounce one curſe againſt Iſrael, becauſe God had ſaid to him that he ſhould not curſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly.
<note place="margin">4. They have intereſt.</note> As in Cities and ſocieties on earth, men have communion and ſociety one with another, the leſs have intereſt in the greater, and the greater in the leſs, and all have intereſt one in another: the inferiours receive from the ſuperiours, protection and proviſion, and the ſuperiours, receive from the inferiours, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and ſubmiſſion. So it is in this heavenly Corporation, in this ſpiritual Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem: <hi>Jeruſalem is a City at unitie in it ſelf;</hi> There is a communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, that the Saints have with God the Father, with Chriſt, with the Angels, with the Saints in heaven, and one with another on earth.</p>
               <p>With God the Father:
<note place="margin">In God.</note> they have an intereſt in him, as ſubjects of his kingdome, as ſervants and children of his family: there is not the meaneſt ſubject in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but he may make his requeſt known to this Prince: there is not the leaſt ſervant in this Family, but he may make his complaint to this Maſter: they may (as children) <hi>go boldly to the throne of grace, and make their requeſt known unto him, though it be but in ſighes and groans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6: 32.</note> Hence it is that God takes notice of them, <hi>your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all theſe things;</hi> and therefore he will ſupply them:
<note place="margin">Chap: 7: 11.</note> 
                  <hi>If you that are earthly can give good things to your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly father give good things to them that ask him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have intereſt in Chriſt alſo:
<note place="margin">In Chriſt.</note> he is their <hi>Interceſſour,</hi> therefore hence it is, that he is ſaid, <hi>to ſit at the right hand of God, making interceſſion for us:</hi> He is their <hi>Advocate; if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt the righteous:</hi> He is their Lord and Captain, <hi>the Captain of the Lords Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan 12: 1.</note> to defend his Church; <hi>Michael, the great Prince ſtandeth up for the children of his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have intereſt alſo in the holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">In the holy Ghoſt.</note> the third Perſon in Trinity, they have not only, <hi>the love of God the Father, but the communion and fellowſhip of the holy Ghoſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2: Cor: 13: 10.</note> as the Apoſtle wiſheth for the Corinthians. Hence it is that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt is ready to help their infirmities, to in able them to put up their requeſts, when they know not how to pray as they ought.</hi> Hence it is that he ſanctiſieth them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſaid to be <hi>Born again of water, and of the ſpirit:</hi> that he comforteth them, therefore he is called <hi>the holy Ghoſt the Comforter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Saints have intereſt in the three Perſons in the Trinity, in reſpect of their dependance upon them, ſo the bleſſed Trinity hath an intereſt in them alſo: <hi>If I be a Father, where is my honour? if I be a Maſter, where is my fear?</hi> Becauſe they acknowledg God to be their Father, they honour him, becauſe they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg him to be their Lord, they fear him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>They have intereſt in the Angels alſo:
<note place="margin">In the Angels.</note> Hence it is that they are called, <hi>Miniſtring ſpirits ſent forth for the good of the Elect:</hi> They were Chriſts meſſengers, his Angels, and now they are made Meſſengers, Angels to the Saints, therefore faith Chriſt, <hi>Offend not one of theſe little ones, for I tell you, that their Angels behold the face of my father in heaven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> They have intereſt in them, not as <hi>worſhippers of Angels,</hi> which the Apoſtle condemneth, <hi>Coll.</hi> 2. as foreſeeing to what a height Popiſh ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition would riſe in this kind: I ſay; not to worſhip them, to invocate them, to pray to them, we know no ſuch will-worſhip which is without the rule. We have an Angel comforting <hi>Hagar;</hi> we have an Angel defending <hi>Eliſha;</hi> we have an Angel incouraging <hi>Jacob;</hi> we have an Angel carrying <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome: But we never had any Angel that ſtood in this place, to have worſhip and adoration. This indeed the Angels have from us, imitation of their obedience, we pray, <hi>thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</hi>

<note place="margin">That are on carte.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Saints on earth have intereſt one in another: by vertue of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion they have intereſt in the prayers, in the gifts, in the wealth one of another, ſofar as neceſſity and love requireth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">5: They are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> and laſtly, as in earthly Cities, and Corporations, there is trading and traff quing, buying and ſelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So here, this heavenly converſation conſiſteth in a kind of heavenly traffique, (as the word importeth;) We either are all, or ſhould be all heavenly merchants,
<note place="margin">Mat: 13.</note> even here upon earth. <hi>The kingdome of heaven is compared, to a treaſure hid in a field, which when a man findeth, he hideth it, and for joy departeth, and ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</hi> It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>Pearl,</hi> which when a man deſcrieth the excellency of it, he giveth all that he hath to poſſeſs that <hi>Pearl:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa: 55 1.</note> There is a heavenly thing, that is worth all that we can give, and it muſt be bought too. It is our Saviours counſel; <hi>come buy of me, yea, come buy wine and milk without money, without price.</hi> It muſt be bought: but bought without money: there is nothing that is ſubject to corruption, that can buy heavenly things:
<note place="margin">The traffique of a Chriſtian what.</note> 
                  <hi>Buy of me eye-ſalve, that you may ſee, and gold that you may be made rich, and garments, that your nakedneſs may not appear.</hi> This muſt be bought, but what muſt we give for it? Chriſt tels us; he ſaith that he himſelf is the <hi>Pearl,</hi> the <hi>treaſure,</hi> and that which we muſt give for him, is no more but this; <hi>Let a man deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and then follow him.</hi> He muſt deny his worldly pleaſures, his carnal affections, the love of his luſts, he muſt renounce his ſins; <hi>If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and caſt it from thee; if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out and caſt it from thee:</hi> What is that? that a man ſhould diſmember himſelf? No ſuch matter; What then? To do that which a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth as harſh a peece of work, as to pluck out his eye, or cut off his hand; that is, to mortifie his carnal affections, to part with his ſweeteſt luſts, which a man holdeth as dear, and ſets as high a rate upon, as on his right hand, or his right eye; there ſhould he no ſin ſo precious, no gain ſo ſweet, no pleaſure ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, but a man ſhould be willing to let it for Chriſt: there ſhould be no world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing whaſoever, that a man ſhould ſo ſet his heart upon, but if perſecution for the Goſpel ſhould come, he ſhould be contented to leave it for Chriſt, and in the mean ſpace to let his affections hang looſe to it, that whenſoever Chriſt ſhall call him to part with his eſtate, with his contentments, with himſelf, he may let all fall for his ſake, and the Goſpels. This is the heavenly traffique of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>I might here lay down ſome tryals,
<note place="margin">How to know whether our converſation be in heaven.</note> by which men may be able to judg of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this particular, whether their <hi>converſation be in heaven.</hi> I will inſtance but in ſome generals, becauſe I haſten to that I principally intend.</p>
               <p>See how thy affections ſtand; ſuch as is a mans mind, ſuch is the man: ſuch as is a mans affection,
<note place="margin">By our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> ſuch is his converſation: a heavenly affection argueth <hi>a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly conver ſation; a heavenly converſation,</hi> preſuppoſeth a heavenly affection: for it is impoſſible for any man to walk in a heavenly courſe, but he that is of a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mind.</p>
               <p>It ſheweth the errour of thoſe men that think, that that pitch of holineſs, and careful walking with God in newneſs of life, is too ſtrict a point to be preſſed: what (ſay they) will you have us to be Saints? are we not men? ſhall we not have infirmities ſtill?</p>
               <p>Yes that thou wilt, when thou haſt done what thou canſt. But here is the thing: What is the bent of thy heart?
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi>
                  </note> what is the ſtrength of thy mind? what is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of thy whole man? which way are thy affections carried? What doſt thou mourn for moſt? what doſt thou rejoyce in moſt? what doſt thou hope for moſt? According to thy affections, ſo will thy labour and endeavour be. A heavenly <pb n="199" facs="tcp:47453:106"/>heart ſorroweth moſt for ſin, a heavenly affection rejoyceth moſt in Chriſt: <hi>Many ſay: who will ſhew us any good, but Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us: thou haſt given me more joy of heart then they had, when their corn, and wine, and oyle abounded.</hi> A heavenly affection hopeth moſt for heaven, and that not ſo much, that thereby he way be releaſed from worldly troubles, as that he may be poſſeſſed of thoſe heavenly joyes, that are to be had in the preſence of God, and in a perfect communion with him; that he may be freed from ſin, and fully brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>glorious liberty of the ſons of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is that which ſtirreth him up with all induſtry and endeavour, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him along mainly, and chiefly to ſeek after, not the wealth, and honour, and pleaſure of the world, but how he may get into the Covenant of grace, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, how he may attain evidences of heaven, and teſtimonies of the love of God. He ſpeakes of heaven, as the worldly man ſpeaks of the world. A world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man <hi>ſpeaks of the world, and the world heareth him</hi> (faith Chriſt) every table ringeth of his worldly talke; every company ſoundeth of his worldly affections; in every meeting he ſheweth his worldly diſpoſition. So a heavenly-minded man is alwayes talking of heavenly things: alwayes labouring to draw heavenly uſes out of earthly things: let croſſes come, he can draw comforts from thence, he makes them means to take off his heart from the world, to ſet it more toward heaven: as <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, the more the waters increaſed, the neerer it was raiſed to heaven: ſo a heavenly man, the more worldly croſſes come, the higher his ſoul riſeth toward heaven: the worldly man ſinketh under afflictions, but he is lifted up neerer to Chriſt. This is <hi>a heavenly converſation.</hi> But I will not ſtand on this.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which I told you was obſervable from the firſt part of the Text,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 2. While the Saints are on earth they are ſtated in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> was this; <hi>That in this very life, the children of God are ſtated in a heavenly condition. Our converſation is now in heaven,</hi> faith the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>When a man is brought by repentance and faith unto Chriſt, he is brought into a heavenly ſtate: actually poſſeſſed of heaven. And that in two reſpects;</p>
               <p>In reſpect of right and title.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt in reſpect of right and title,
<note place="margin">1. In reſpect of right and title.</note> and that alſo firſt in reſpect of Election: God hath elected them to it. Secondly in reſpect of vocation: <hi>they are begotten again to a lively hope.</hi> They have now the Word which giveth them a promiſe of heaven. They have now the ſpirit, which is <hi>the ſeal of their inheritance, you are ſealed by the ſpirit of Promiſe, to the day of redemption,</hi> Eph. 1.13.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. In reſpect of preſent poſſeſſion.</note> in regard of poſſeſſion: they are now already in preſent poſſeſſion, not in full poſſeſſion, but in preſent poſſeſſion: A poſſeſſion not in themſelves, but in Chriſt, by vertue of the union and communion they have in him. By the union and contract that is between Chriſt and the ſoul; Chriſt is become the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, the Chriſtian the Spouſe. So that as a Wife if her Husband ſhould travel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a far Countrey, and in her name ſhould take poſſeſſion of thoſe lands, that were left her by her Father, the Wife now is poſſeſt of thoſe lands, in her Husband, who in her name hath taken poſſeſſion of them: ſo Chriſt entring into heaven, hath took poſſeſſion of heaven, which is given to us by the will of God; <hi>It is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſures to give you a kingdom:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 14.</note> Chriſt hath poſſeſſed it in our name: <hi>I go</hi> (faith he) <hi>to prepare a place for you: and it is my will that they be where I am: I go to my Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.</hi> All that Chriſt hath in heaven. He hath it for us: He is gone before, that we may follow after: we cannot poſſibly lay claime to heaven, we cannot hope hereafter fully, and perſonally to poſſeſſe it, if Chriſt had not firſt taken poſſeſſion of heaven for us.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this in a word, ſhall be to ſtir up every one to look to his hope of heaven. It is uſual for men to profeſs their hope to be ſaved, and ſcarſe any, but they will ſay, they hope, if they die, they ſhall go to heaven. Yea, but thou muſt now poſſeſſe it, if ever hereafter thou mean to enjoy it: and thou muſt poſſeſſe it <pb n="200" facs="tcp:47453:107"/>firſt in Chriſt: thou muſt be united to him by faith and love: thoſe are the bonds whereby the Spirit of God, tyeth us unto Chriſt: therefore Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>dwell in our hearts by faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which ſhewes the horrible preſumption of many,
<note place="margin">Preſumption to hope for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without union with Chriſt firſt on earth.</note> and how they add to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins this, that they preſume that they have right, and title to heaven, and yet are not united to Chriſt by faith: as if a man ſhould give out, that he were the heir apparant to a Crown, or the ſon of a King, and yet nevertheleſs ſhould indeed be the ſon of a Beggar, and have nothing to ſhew for his pretended title to the Crown and Kingdom: what would this be accounted, but high treaſon againſt the King? What a height of ſin is this that is in many men, which to their other ſins add a preſumptuous claim to heaven, when they have no right to it?</p>
               <p>I Remember,
<note place="margin">Ezra 2.62.</note> that in the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> we ſhall read of many, that laid title and claim to the Prieſt-hood: but <hi>Ezra</hi> ſearched the book of the Genealogies, and finding none of their names Regiſtred there, he preſently concluded that they were none of the Prieſt-hood, therefore <hi>they were accounted polluted,</hi> and put from the Prieſt-hood. If any man lay claim to heaven; God will ſearch his book of Genealogies (as it were) he will ſearch the Regiſter of heaven, and if he find that his name be not inrolled there, if he be not found to have intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, all will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he ſhall be caſt out to his greater confuſion. This ſhould therefore ſtir up every one to make good his claim to heaven now: either now to be poſſeſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, now to <hi>ſit in heavenly places with Chriſt,</hi> ore lſe look not to come to heaven afterward.</p>
               <p>But to leave this, and to come to that I mainly intend, namely the Argument, or reaſon, or ground, of the Apoſtles heavenly converſation. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle obſerveth here a kind of ſpeech, and that which ſeems not ſo Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall: that he may thereupon build a ſound and ſubſtantial truth in Divinity. He had ſaid before, <hi>Our converſation is in the heavens,</hi> in the Plural number: but now when he ſpeaks of Chriſts coming thence, he ſpeaks of it in the Singular number, <hi>Our converſation is in the heaven,</hi> from whence, from which particular place, <hi>We look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Of purpoſe to ſhew us thus much: that though Chriſt in reſpect of his Deity,
<note place="margin">Chriſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his bodily preſence is only in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> and divine nature he be in all places, <hi>filling heaven and earth:</hi> yet in reſpect of his bodily preſence, he remaineth now, and ſo will till his ſecond coming (which the Saints look for) in heaven.</p>
               <p>Againſt thoſe <hi>Ubiquitaries,</hi> that will have the body of Chriſt to be every where: In Heaven (ſay they) viſible;
<note place="margin">Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</note> in this place inviſible. The Papiſts hence build the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation: they will have the body of Chriſt, even that very body that was born of the Virgin, to be now Bread, and the bread turned into it. The Lutherans will have the ſame Body about the bread. No, faith the Apoſtle, there is no ſuch matter: from thence, from that very place, that very individual, particular, ſingle place, from the third heavens, where the body of Chriſt is, <hi>We look for the Saviour:</hi> he remaineth there, and ſo will continue till his coming to Judgement.
<note place="margin">Cell. 3.1.</note> So again in another place, <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Set your affections on things above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God; Above,</hi> that is in heaven, <hi>where Chriſt ſitteth,</hi> and continueth, and will remain till his ſecond coming. Our Saviour told his Diſciples in the dayes of his fleſh, <hi>that the poor they ſhould have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with them, but me</hi> (faith he) <hi>you ſhall not have alwayes.</hi> If this be true that they ſay, then Chriſt hath not ſaid true, for he is ſtill in reſpect of his bodily preſence, and hath been, alwayes, with us. But I let paſs that.</p>
               <p>The thing I note hence is this;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſer:</hi> 3. Expectation of Chriſts coming to Judgement, the beſt means to work a man to a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</note> That <hi>that which moſt ſoundly, and effectually ſettleth the heart of a man, in a heavenly converſation upon earth, is the looking for the Saviour of the world, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to come from thence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, there is nothing that ſo ſettleth the heart of a man in a heavenly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation upon earth, nothing that makes him ſo heavenly minded, nothing that order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him in ſo heavenly a courſe, as this, if he rightly look for Chriſt to come from thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:47453:107"/>That you may conceive this the better, you may pleaſe to take notice, that there are two things included in this point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that all the Saints of God, while they are on earth, their continual expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is,
<note place="margin">The continual expectation of the Saints is for Chriſt coming.</note> for Chriſt to come from heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that nothing is ſo effectual to ſettle a man in a holy courſe while he liveth on earth, as this expectation.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things I will open to you at this time.</p>
               <p>The firſt (I ſay) is, that the Saints and ſervants of God while they are on earth, do continually expect and look for <hi>the Saviour of the world, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to come from heaven.</p>
               <p>By the coming of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">A threefold coming of Chriſt.</note> you muſt underſtand his ſecond coming to judgement. For there is a threefold coming of Chriſt. A twofold coming in his Body; and one by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>The firſt, was the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, when he came to take our nature upon him, and to be born of a Virgin.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, is the coming of Chriſt by his Spirit, ſo he cometh continually, and daily in the hearts of men, in the preaching of the Goſpel in vertue and efficacy.</p>
               <p>His laſt coming, and his ſecond coming in reſpect of his body, is when he ſhall come to judgement. Never look for the coming of Chriſt in his body upon earth in the ſight of men, till that great day come, when the <hi>Lord Jeſus ſhall come with thouſands of his Angels, in the glory of his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then this being the meaning of it: we will prove it. And firſt, that it is the continual expectation of all the Saints of God, and the continual deſire of their hearts, their continual waiting, is for the ſecond coming of the Lord Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As it was before the firſt coming of Chriſt in the fleſh,
<note place="margin">Proved.</note> ſo it ſhall be before his ſecond coming. Before the firſt coming of Chriſt, after the promiſe was made to <hi>Adam,</hi> all the expectation and hope of the Fathers, and Beleevers, was this, when the great Meſſias would come: and therefore faith <hi>Jacob, I have waited for thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> and <hi>David, I have longed for thy ſalvation,</hi> meaning Chriſt, the Saviour of the world: and the Church groweth to a kind of holy impatiency; <hi>Oh that thou wouldeſt break the heavens and come down.</hi> And immediatly upon the time of Chriſts coming, there were alwayes holy men in thoſe times, that were ſtirred up with a continual expectation of it, and therefore it was made a mark of a good man in thoſe dayes: It is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> and of divers good women, as of <hi>Anna</hi> and others, <hi>that they waited for the conſolation of Iſrael;</hi> they continually waited and expected, when the great comforter, and Saviour of his people would come. So ſhall the ſecond coming of Chriſt be: from the very time of his Aſcenſion into heaven, to the time now, and to the time of his laſt coming to Judgement, all the eyes of men will be towards him: <hi>When I am lifted up</hi> (faith our Saviour) <hi>I will draw all men after me;</hi> which though it be there particularly underſtood of his lifting up upon the Croſs; yet it is intended in general of his Aſcenſion into heaven. So that as after the promiſe was given of the Spirit; <hi>The Diſciples waited for the receiving of the gift of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> So it is now, and will be, ſince the holy Ghoſt is already given, there remaineth nothing to be looked for, but Chriſt himſelf in his ſecond coming to finiſh all theſe dayes of ſin.</p>
               <p>And that this is the diſpoſition of all the ſervants of God, appears by divers places of Scripture,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.8.</note> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. faith the Apoſtle there; <hi>Hence forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, ſhall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto them alſo that love his appearing.</hi> The Apoſtle here makes a deſcription of all thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, and he faith, they are ſuch as <hi>love the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> now that which a man loveth, he deſireth,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.8.</note> and looks, and longs for. And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>Chriſt died once for many, and unto them that look for him, ſhall he appeare the ſecond time unto ſalvation.</hi> Salvation is brought: to whom? to all thoſe; and only to thoſe that <hi>look for the <pb n="202" facs="tcp:47453:108"/>appearance of Chriſt.</hi> Therefore it is ſaid of all the Beleevers in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>That they ſaw things that were inviſible, and that they had an eye to the recompense of reward, and that they ſaw the promiſe a far off.</hi> They looked ſtill for thoſe things that were to appear by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This I ſuppoſe is ſufficiently confirmed by the Scripture, let us therefore make ſome uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Try now what comfort thou haſt in the expectation of that great appearance of the Lord Jeſus here ſpoken of.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> For tryal.</note> This is the moſt infalible ground, and undoubted evidence, and teſtimony of the truth of grace now, and aſſurance of glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: if God have now ſtirred up thy heart in faith, and holy affection, to look for, and to long and waite for the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt. Without this there is little love to Chriſt. The Church in <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2. ſheweth her love to Chriſt, <hi>Draw me</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>and we will run after thee.</hi> And chap. 2.4. <hi>Stay me with flaggons, comfort me with apples, for I am ſick of love:</hi> and chap. 5. <hi>If you find him whome my ſoul loveth, tell him I am ſick of love.</hi> If thou be of the diſpoſition of the Church, thou wilt, out of love to Chriſt, deſire nothing ſo much, as to enjoy the preſence of Chriſt: <hi>The Spirit and the Bride, ſay come, and let him that heareth, ſay come: the Spirit faith come, and the Bride</hi> (becauſe ſhe is ſtirred up in the ſame affection by the Spirit) <hi>ſhe faith come</hi> too. Chriſt faith to his Church, <hi>I come,</hi> and the Church ſhe faith again, <hi>Come:</hi> Here is the agreement between Chriſt and his Church, and the ſame diſpoſition is in all the members of Chriſt, a waiting and longing, and deſiring for the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There are many that pretend they wait, and deſire for the coming of Chriſt. When a man is under any affliction, or in any trouble, then, <hi>Oh that Chriſt would come and end theſe troubles.</hi> You ſhall here a man that is abuſed, and wronged by the oppreſſions and injuries of others, and by the unrighteous dealings of wicked and ungodly men, crying out, <hi>Oh that Chriſt would come and put an end to theſe evil times.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How to know whether our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Chriſt coming be right.</note> Yea, but if thou haſt this deſire of Chriſts coming, that is in a man of a heavenly converſation. It will appear in theſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it will appear by the Ground of it. What are the grounds of thy deſire? what are the motives that incourage thee, to long for the coming of the Lord Jeſus?
<note place="margin">1. By the ground of it. Heb. 11.1.</note> That which is the ground of faith, is the ground of hope: that is the promiſes: <hi>Faith is the ground of things hoped for:</hi> and the Word and Promiſe are the warrant of Faith: Faith and Hope look both on this, the free promiſe of God: ſo it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, that be beleeved above hope, becauſe be knew that be that promiſed, was able to do it.</hi> There is the firſt thing then: Faith is the ground: there is none but a true beleever, that can indeed aright wait for, and deſire the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But this will appeare more in the ſecond thing, and that is, by the companion of this expectation of Chriſts coming, when it is right, and as it ſhould be in the ſoul of a Beleever.</p>
               <p>The firſt companion of it,
<note place="margin">2. By the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of it. Which are, 1. Patience.</note> is <hi>Patience: If we hope for that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it</hi> (faith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.25.) If we have hope, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt coming, if it be right, it will ſtay the heart, and calm and quiet the ſpirit, in the middeſt of all injuries and croſſes, and afflictions in the world; it will make us to wait with patience: <hi>He that beleeveth will not make haſt.</hi> When a man belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that there is a time when Chriſt will put an end to all theſe things, it is that which mortiſieth and ſubdueth the riſing of his ſpirit, and diſcontentedneſs in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, it makes him <hi>poſſeſſe his ſoul in Patience.</hi> There is a kind of impatient waiting of men, in the middeſt of diſcontent and revilings, and evil ſpeakings, and threatings of others: and then, <hi>Oh that Chriſt would come.</hi> But when Faith works kindly in the ſoul of a man: there is a calm compoſedneſs of heart: a ſubmiſſion to God in the preſent tryal: and yet nevertheleſs a rejoycing, in hope of the coming of Chriſt, and of that <hi>glory that ſhall be revealed.</hi> That is the firſt thing, there is Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accompanying it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that accompanieth it,
<note place="margin">2. Love.</note> is <hi>Love.</hi> No man can in truth and aright, hope for, and wait for the coming of Chriſt, but he that loveth Chriſt and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:47453:108"/>Now this Love muſt be grounded on our taſte of Gods love: <hi>Not that we loved him, but that be loved us firſt,</hi> (faith the Apoſtle) no man loveth Chriſt, but firſt he is loved of Chriſt: no man loveth God, but firſt he is loved of God: and the taſte and reliſh of Gods love in my ſoule, works love to God again: as from the heat that cometh from the Sun, there is a reflection that boundeth back again to the Sun: ſo Gods love in us reflects love to God again.</p>
               <p>This Love will appear in the ſecret ſighings of the heart:
<note place="margin">Maniſeſted in ſecret longings.</note> 
                  <hi>All the creatures groan; yea, we alſo ſigh in our ſelves</hi> (faith the Apoſtle) <hi>waiting for the adoption, even the redemption of our bodies.</hi> There is, I ſay, a ſecret ſighing of heart, and that not only in the time of trouble and affliction: but in the time of comfort and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, when a man hath abundance of outward things about him, yet then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his love is ſet upon Chriſt, and the perfection and end of love, is the fruition of the object loved, therefore there is a ſighing, a holy diſcontent, as it were, a kind of yearning of the heart toward Chriſt: <hi>When ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> (faith <hi>David) how long Lord, how long?</hi> (faith the Church in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) If a man love Chriſt, and his coming only, becauſe it ſhall end thoſe miſeries, and thoſe troubles that are upon him in this life: this is not ſo much love of Chriſt, as love of a mans ſelf, of his own eaſe, and peace, and reſt. But the love of Chriſt is this, when for the injoying of himſelf, I long for the fruition of <hi>him whom my ſoul loveth,</hi> and I account nothing amiable in compariſon of Chriſt, nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable, nothing comfortable, nothing ſweet to Chriſt: this is it that putteth the ſoul out of taſte, and reliſh with any thing, makes it ſigh, as it were, under the enjoyments of all the comforts of this life, and long for the appearance of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then he ſhall he perfected in the perfect enjoyment of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>This is that love of Chriſt, that is accompanied with Faith in a Chriſtian, and hope, and expectation of his coming.</p>
               <p>Now then, if thou wait for Chriſt in truth, how cometh it, that thou doſt not love him? thou cauſt not wait for him aright, except thou love Chriſt himſelf, and for himſelf.</p>
               <p>And if thou love Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Care to walk in Chriſt.</note> it wil appear, by thy care to walk in Chriſt: to derive virtue from him in all holy actions, to derive all heavenly wiſdom, all heavenly diſpoſition of heart from him: to pleaſe Chriſt in all thy waies, to do that whereby thou maiſt approve thy ſelf to God in Chriſt. This is the diſpoſition of a heart loving Chriſt, and this is that loving of Chriſt for himſelf, and in himſelf that giveth me aſſurance, that I love the appearance of Chriſt. That is the ſecond companion of this waiting for Chriſt, if it be right, there is a love to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt companion of a mans waiting for Chriſt,
<note place="margin">3. delight in the ordinances.</note> is the continual affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, thoſe ſame ejaculations, that intercourſe, that holy and heavenly communion which the ſoul hath with Chriſt here. Firſt in his ordinances, having a holy communion with him in them, waiting at the <hi>Poſts of the door of wiſdomes houſe,</hi> to here what Chriſt (who is <hi>wiſdome</hi> it ſelf) will ſpeak to us: waiting if that he will come now (in the miniſtry of his Word) in his Spirit, whom we hope to enjoy fully in glory: Waiting for him likewiſe in the Sacraments to receive a further confirmation of our faith in him: waiting for him alſo in prayer, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive further conſolation and ſtrength from him. Thus <hi>Annah</hi> it is ſaid, that She was <hi>one that waited for the conſolation of Iſrael, and ſerved God in the Temple in prayer day and night.</hi> So where there is a waiting for Chriſt, there will be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual intercourſe of the ſoul with Chriſt, a heavenly and holy communion with him in duties.</p>
               <p>Doſt thou wait for Chriſts coming, and yet run from Chriſts ordinances? How can theſe ſtand together? There is no man that can ever wait with comfor for Chriſts coming in glory, but he that now waiteth upon Chriſt in his ordinances. If thy delight be in holy duties, in the worſhip of God, and that in ſuch religious performances thou waiteſt for a further conveyance of the Spirit of Chriſt into thee, thou haſt warrant to wait for, and to expect with comfort the ſecond coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Try your ſelves therefore by theſe things. It is not every one that faith, <hi>I would <pb n="204" facs="tcp:47453:109"/>that the Lord Jeſus would come, or I would that theſe dayes were full, and finiſhed.</hi> It is not every one that ſaith thus, that rightly looks for, or deſires the coming of Chriſt. But he that thereby becometh patient, and ſtayes, and compoſeth his heart in a calme and quiet temper in the middeſt of all croſſes, and troubles, and afflictions that befal him, and that upon this ground, becauſe Chriſt will come and put an end to my ſin, as well as to my ſorrow, therefore I will wait with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till he come. And again, he that loveth Chriſt, that ſigheth for his coming; and he that now delighteth in his ordinances: this man only waiteth for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is yet a third Tryal,
<note place="margin">3 By the effects and fruits of it</note> and that is, the effects and fruits of our waiting for the coming of Chriſt: And that is threefold (to go no further then the Text.)</p>
               <p>The firſt is, a <hi>heavenly converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is, a mans reſting on Chriſt as <hi>his Saviour and Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is, <hi>the change of the body,</hi> which ſhall be in the great day, when the ſoul and body ſhall be united together, <hi>Who ſhall change our vile body, and make it like his own glorious body,</hi> &amp;c. But the main fruit whereof we are now preſently poſſeſt, is a <hi>heavenly Converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo I come to the ſecond particular included in the obſervation before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That nothing is ſo effectual to ſettle a man,
<note place="margin">The expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts coming the beſt means to procure a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</note> and to diſpoſe him to a holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Converſation here on earth, as the right looking for the ſecond coming of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this is true, you ſhall ſee it brefly, how the Saints of God upon this very ground have been wrought, and incouraged to a heavenly converſation in all the parts and degrees of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all,
<note place="margin">Proved. 1. It is the worker of Mortification.</note> yee ſhall ſee, that this is that which mortifieth the ſecret luſts and corruptions of the heart. A man will never ſet ſoundly, and in truth, to the mortification of his inward corruptions, that doth not in truth out of love to Chriſt look for his ſecond coming. And the very reaſon why many are ſo dull and dead, and backward to this work (for want whereof they cannot lead ſo heavenly a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, upon earth) is this, becauſe they do not with love to Chriſt look for his ſecond coming.</p>
               <p>And that this is ſo, it will appear by divers places of Scripture. <hi>Set your affections</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>on things that are above,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Colloſ. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God:</hi> And he doth not only ſay ſo, but <hi>Mortiſie therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your earthly members.</hi> Wherefore ſhould they <hi>mortifie their earthly members? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God;</hi> upon whom ye look, upon whom the eye of your faith is fixed: <hi>mortifie your members.</hi> For what is that that makes a man in truth to diſpoſe and frame his heart, to be fit to ſtand in the number of thoſe that <hi>are clothed in white Robes</hi> at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, but even this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that none ſhall appear then with comfort, but ſuch as now walk in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of converſation?</p>
               <p>Certainly that man that doth with delight expect his ſecond coming, he will be moſt careful to fit himſelf for the receiving of Chriſt, and moſt diligent in ſetting himſelf to the mortifying, and ſubduing of his corruptions, that ſo he may walk before him in all holineſs of life. A man that expects the coming of a King to his houſe: will he therefore be ſecure, and do nothing becauſe he knows certainly that the King will come? No ſurely, he will therefore, becauſe he is ſure that he will come, make ready and furniſh his houſe, that it may be fit to receive him when he doth come. Even ſo, becauſe I expect the coming of the great King, <hi>the King of glory</hi> (as he is called in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.) I will now <hi>open my everlaſting gates.</hi> I will now labour that he may poſſeſs my ſoul, I will now <hi>cleanſe my ſelf from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and pollution of fleſh and ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the Apoſtle Saint <hi>John</hi> having ſaid,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>We are now the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know, that when he ſhall appear, we <pb n="205" facs="tcp:47453:109"/>ſhall be like unto him: for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> He preſently inferreth, <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> He that hath this hope, that he ſhall be with Chriſt, <hi>that he ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> he will be careful <hi>to purifie himſelf, as Chriſt is pure.</hi> This is the diſpoſitton of a man that truly longs, and rightly looks for the coming of Chriſt, he will be careful to <hi>purifie himſelf.</hi> A man that expects to be raiſed to ſome great and eminent place in the Court, he will be careful to fit himſelf with thoſe neceſſary requiſits that may make him capable of it, and enable him to go through it with credit and comfort. So he that expects to have this great honour of the Saints, to be of the number of thoſe that receive glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and happineſs, and comfort by the ſecond coming of Chriſt: he will be careful to purge his heart from all corruption, that it may be capable to receive that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>What daunts a man at the apprehenſion of death,
<note place="margin">Guilt of ſin cauſeth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of death to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</note> and makes him have no delight in thinking of Judgment to come? but the guilt of ſecret ſins, with which he hath been, and is ſo unwilling to part. It is impoſſible for any man to look with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort upon the approach of Death, and to take delight in, and deſire the ſecond coming of Chriſt, but he who upon this ground is careful to purge his heart of all ſecret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and luſts whatſoever. This is then the firſt thing wherein it doth appear, that the looking for the coming of Chriſt, is a ſpecial means to work us to a holy and heavenly converſation.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2: Subdues out worldly affections.</note> as this is that which mortifieth the ſecret luſts, and corruptions of the heart, ſo it is that alſo which mortifies our worldly affections. For what is it that will ſubdue in the heart, and purge out of it the love of the world, and worldly things but this, the looking for, and expectation of a better eſtate to be had in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt at his ſecond coming? What is it that makes men hold the world ſo faſt? What makes them ſo gripple of the earth, and to cleave ſo cloſe to the things of this life? But becauſe they have no comfortable perſwaſion, and expectation of a better eſtate afterwards. Certainly he that on a right ground, and upon good warrant can expect with comfort the ſecond coming of Chriſt, he careth nothing for the things of this life.
<note place="margin">Colloſ: 3: 1.</note> Therefore faith the Apoſtle; <hi>If you be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God;</hi> becauſe, <hi>Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God,</hi> therefore ſet your affections there: But how ſhall we come to ſet our affections there? <hi>Set them not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>upon the things of the earth.</hi> It is neceſſary that the ſoul of a man ſhould have ſomething or other to faſten upon, ſome object to take up its delight and joy: and he that cannot have joy and delight in better things, in things above, he looks for it in things below: and the reaſon why he ſo cleaves to, and claſps, and huggs with delight the things below; is becauſe he hath no better things to think of, to hope after. He that hath a better inheritance to hope for, will eaſily let fall theſe things, and his affection to them, becauſe his hope is in Chriſt who ſhall make him glorious at his ſecond coming. You ſee then the neceſſity of it in this ſecond reſpect.</p>
               <p>But to go further;
<note place="margin">3. Keeps us from ſinful actions.</note> it is neceſſary alſo for the avoyding of any evil, of any ſin in the act. What is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This is the Argument that the Apoſte uſed to the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians to bring them from Idolatry <hi>to ſerve the living God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17: 30.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a time to judg the world in righteouſneſs, by that man whom ho hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Even for that reaſon, becauſe <hi>God hath appointed a time to judg the world in righteousneſs,</hi> therefore they ſhould <hi>turne from their Idols to ſerve the living God.</hi> 
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:47453:110"/>There is nothing that doth ſo unbottome the heart, nothing ſo ſhakes and looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a mans hold of ſin and unrighteouſneſs, as the conſideration of Chriſts coming to Judgment. What will it boot me (will the ſoul reaſon) to keep my ſins when Chriſt will come to judg me for my ſins? What ſhall I get by going on in a courſe of ſin, when I can look for nothing then, but a ſentence of wrath to be denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt me? This then is that that doth ſettle a man in a holy converſation in that reſpect.</p>
               <p>Nay fourthly,
<note place="margin">4 Quickneſs to holineſs of life.</note> this is that alſo which quickneth a man to the practiſe of all holy duties in his place, both in his general and particular Calling. It is the very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> uſeth, to ſtir us up to holineſs of converſation; <hi>Seeing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3: 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>looking for the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire ſhall be diſſolved, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid: Look now about the whole world, and ſee what it is that now can comfort you, if you be ſuch as go on in a courſe of ſin: It may be you will ſay, I fear not much, for I have many friends: Yea, but all theſe ſhall die. It may be thou haſt ſtore of lands; but all that ſhall be burnt with fire. It may be thou haſt many pleaſures: but then there ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Judgment. The coming of the Lord, that ſhall then put an end to all theſe, and turn the courſe of things, the expectation thereof is a ſpecial means to take us off from a courſe of ſin, and put us on to a courſe of obedience, to make us walk in another kind of faſhion while we are in the world. Therefore the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ir up <hi>Timothy</hi> to the work of the Miniſtry, what is the Argument that he uſeth? <hi>I charge thee before Chriſt, who ſhall judg the quick and the dead.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay; there ſhall be an appearing before the Lord, and therefore if thou wilt give thy account up with joy at that day, I charge thee to look to thy Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>So may I ſay to every man in his place; <hi>I charge thee</hi> that art a Maſter of a Family, look to the buſineſs of thy family, to the ſalvation of the ſouls of thy people. <hi>I charge thee</hi> that art a father or a mother, to look to the ſalvation of the ſouls of thy children. <hi>I charge thee</hi> that art a Chriſtian, to look to the ſalvation of thy own ſoul. And how is the charge? <hi>I charge thee before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judg the quick and the dead.</hi> Becauſe there ſhall come a time, when both thou and they ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before Chriſt at his appearing; therefore if thou wilt have comfort in them, and in thy ſelf, and in Chriſt; be careful to do the duty that concerns thy place, <hi>Looking for the coming of the Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then you ſee in this reſpect alſo there is nothing ſo forcible an Argument to ſettle a man in a holy converſation, in a heavenly courſe as this, for a man alwayes to look for the ſecond coming of Chriſt.</p>

What is the reaſon that a man hath not that ſpirit of fear and trembling upon him, that ſhall be upon the hearts of all thoſe that go on in ſin,
<note place="margin">Rev: 6.</note> when they ſhall cry to the mountains to fall upon them? but this, that he hath continued in a holy converſation, and conſtantly walked before the Lord with an upright heart. <hi>I have finiſhed my courſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have kept the faith, hence-forth is layd up for me a crown of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, which Chriſt the righteous Judg ſhall give to me, and to all them that love his appearing.</hi> Still the ſervants of God have incouraged themſelves to perſevere in a holy courſe, from the expectation of the coming of Chriſt, that will give them a reward for their conſtancy in his ſervice. It is the Argument that the holy Ghoſt <pb n="207" facs="tcp:47453:110"/>uſeth to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> Rev. 3.11. <hi>Hold faſt that thou haſt, and let no man take thy crown.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, There is a time coming when Crowns ſhall be given: but to whome? to thoſe that hold out, that perſevere in a godly courſe, <hi>Be thou faithful to the death, and thou ſhalt receive a crown of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that, I ſay, that will make a man go on, will make him that is good in youth, be good in age alſo; becauſe whenſoever he dieth, he ſhall receive his Crown. This will make a man that he ſhall not <hi>begin in the ſpirit, and end in the fleſh:</hi> this will make him, that <hi>having put his hand to the plough, he will not look back;</hi> becauſe he no further looks for comfort in the appearance of Chriſt, then he hath had care to walk on conſtantly in a good courſe.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the point proved to you, that a Chriſtian ſoul hath a main benefit by his looking for the ſecond coming of Chriſt; and that this is it that makes him careful to mortifie his ſecret luſts: that this is it that makes him careful to purge himſelf from worldly affections: that this is it that makes him induſtrious to avoid evil courſes: that this is it that makes him diligent in good actions; that this is it that makes him conſtant, and to perſevere to the end in all holy wayes, and in avoiding of all evil: becauſe he looks for, and waites for the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now then take this for a main tryal of your ſelves,

                  <hi>and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief Captaines, and the mighty men, and every bond-man, and every free-man</hi> (men of all ſorts) <hi>hide themſelves in the dens, and in the rock of the mountians, and ſaid to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of his wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand?</hi> Would you therefore hold up your heads with comfort and with joy? that when you hear a <hi>Funeral Sermon,</hi> it might comfort you to think, It will not be long before my time ſhall come,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.14.</note> before my time ſhall be? would you in truth have <hi>freedome from the fear of death,</hi> which Chriſt hath purchaſed? (<hi>for he tooke upon him the ſame nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the children were partakers of fleſh and blood, that he might free them, who for fear of death were hold in bondage all their life.</hi>) Would you have comfort in Chriſts coming to Judgment? See how effectually this works in you.</p>
               <p>Is it thus effectual, that becauſe you look for Chriſts coming, therefore you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your ſelves; therefore you purge out your luſts and corruptions, becauſe there ſhall be nothing then (<hi>when the ſecrets of all bearts ſhall be manifeſt</hi>) that ſhall be diſpleaſing to him when he ſhall come? Are you careful to let fall worldly affections, becauſe you have a comfortable apprenenſion of heavenly joyes? Are you careful to turn your courſe from ſin, becauſe you would not lie open to the <hi>judgement of condemnation?</hi> Are you careful to do good, to perſevere in the practiſe of godlineſs, becauſe <hi>he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry?</hi> If it be thus with you, then you may with comfort think of that day, then you may with chearfulneſs look upon the day of death: <hi>the day of death then, is better then the day in which thou wert borne:</hi> It is better to thee then the day of thy marriage, it is the day of that great Marriage that ſhall be made between Chriſt and thy ſoul to all eternity: It is better then the day that thou obtaineſt thy freed one, then the day that thou comeſt out of thy Apprentiſhip: it is the day wherein thou art ſet free, and brought <hi>unto the glorious liberty of the ſons of God:</hi> It is a day that is better then the day of the enjoyment of the greateſt comforts of this life, becauſe it ſets thee in the poſſeſſion of <hi>pleaſures that are at Gods right hand for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take this conſideration therefore to heart: and that you may walk in a holy courſe the better, and with more conſtancy, keep the object alwayes cloſe to your eye. Think with your ſelves and ſay: If we would walk as Saints in heaven, we <pb n="208" facs="tcp:47453:111"/>muſt live as Saints on earth. But how ſhall we do this? Be often thinking of the coming of Chriſt: often put this queſtion to your ſouls; What if Chriſt ſhould now come: If he ſhould come now I am in the Church, am I hearing the Word with that affection that I ought to here it with? If he ſhould come now I am in my calling, in my world buſineſs, do I follow it with a heavenly diſpoſition as I ought to do? What if he ſhould come now while I am feaſting, ſhould he take me as one feaſting with fear leſt I ſhould ſin againſt God in my mirth? What if he ſhould come and take me aſleep, have I made my peace with God before I went to reſt?</p>
               <p>Work theſe conſiderations upon thy ſoul. When the morning cometh, think, it may be Chriſt will come and take me away before evening, how ſhall I walk this day, that I may have comfort in the coming of Chriſt? When the Evening is come, think, it may be I ſhall never ſee morning before the great day of the Reſurrection, what now ſhall I do, that if I die in my ſleep I may reſt in the Lord, and ſo may have comfort in his appearance? Either this moment, either this minute, ſettle thy comfort and peace with Chriſt; or it may be the next hour it will be too late. And remember that if ever you will live a holy life, if ever you will have a heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation on earth, you muſt be much, and ſeriouſly ſettled in this meditation: ſlight it not, paſs it not in your thoughts as a matter of diſcourſe, but let it be a working meditation, let it be effectual to produce ſomewhat in you that may warm and heat your hearts, and to ſet on fire the whole ſoul, and to purge out the droſs of corruption that remains in you.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee what it is that the Apoſtle here undertakes for himſelf, and for as many as walked as he did: they had <hi>a heavenly Converſation,</hi> and that which made them have <hi>a heavenly converſation,</hi> was the <hi>looking for the coming of Chriſt.</hi> This was the fruit of their looking for the coming of Chriſt, it made them walk in a heavenly converſation on earth.</p>
               <p>There is another fruit of this: by their looking for Chriſt, they ſhall find him to be a Lord and Jeſus: <hi>We look for the Saviour the Lord Jeſus:</hi> Which word ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that all that Chriſt did for the purchaſe of our redemption, he did it by price, and by power.</p>
               <p>He did it by price,
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1 10.</note> he ſatisfied his Fathers Juſtice, and ſo he is a Saviour: <hi>We wait</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ:</hi> 1.10.) <hi>for his Son from heaven, whom he raiſed from the dead, even Jeſus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by power to, over Sathan: ſo he is a Lord, the Lord of might. Thou ſhalt find at the day of Chriſts, that he will both be Saviour and Lord to thee. A Saviour to free thee from ſin and condemnation; A Lord, to beſtow upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and glory with the Saints. This is another benefit of our looking for Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the manner before ſpoken of, we ſhall find him then to be a Lord, and Jeſus: one that will ſave us from our ſins, and one that hath power to beſtow heaven upon us.</p>
               <p>Wouldeſt thou then have this comfort at that day? Let him be ſo here to thee in this life: let him be thy Lord and commander of all thy affections, of the whole man, yeeld obedience now to his will, and thou ſhalt find him a Jeſus then. He is not a Jeſus, a Saviour, except he be a Lord and Commander alſo. But you ſee I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand to inſiſt upon this.</p>
               <p>The occaſion of our meeting at this time, is to commit to the Earth the body of our Siſter departed: She hath now the termination and concluſion of all her wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and expectation. And after ſo long a waiting, there remaineth a ſleeping in the Grave awhile, when the ſoul reſteth in the hands of Chriſt, and waiteth for that great day, when body and ſoul ſhall be joyned together.</p>
               <p>I perſwade my ſelf well of her, that She was one of the number of thoſe waiters that ſhall have joy at the coming of Chriſt; I had not much knowledg af her, only I obſerved in her ſickneſs a good purpoſe and deſire of new and better obedience, and performing better ſervice to Chriſt then ſhe had done, if God ſhould have ſpared her longer. And ſhe expreſſed alſo a great deſire of Chriſts ſecond coming; a deſire that he would receive her to himſelf, and that theſe dayes of ſin might be <pb n="209" facs="tcp:47453:111"/>finiſhed. Much ſhe was in theſe deſires, and ſhe had good warrant for it: for ſhe was careful (as I am informed) to ſet up the kingdome of Chriſt in her Family. It is the duty of a good Wife to be a help to her Husband, eſpecially in matters of piety, and the worſhip of God: and therein her example ſhould teach wives to ſtrive herein. She was alwayes ſtirring him up to prayer in his Family, to a more careful ſanctifying of the Lords day, herein She was frequent. She was much mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world for ſome late years (as it was obſerved in her daily courſe by thoſe that knew her.) Thus ſhe laboured to fit her ſelf and her Family, that ſhe might have comfort in the great Day of the appearing of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak upon information, for your edification, to ſtir you up to labour to fit your ſelves for Chriſt, by purging out of ſin in your hearts and lives. Labour to fit your Families for Chriſt, that when you, and your ſervants and children, ſhall appear before him, you may look on them, and look on Chriſt with comfort, as men that before have prepared themſelves for the coming of Chriſt, and as thoſe that then ſhall lift up their heads, becauſe the day of their redemption draweth nigh.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not long (men and brethren) ſince <hi>Death</hi> rode in triumph thorow this City, and did bear down all before him: he lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up your houſes, pulled down your windows, and made the wealthieſt among you put upon them the ſemblance of Banck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>routneſs, by locking up their doors, and turning their backs to their houſes, and running away, ſo it plaid the Tyrant then: there died thouſands a week, and the Grave that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies cryeth, <hi>Give, give,</hi> was almoſt cloyed with carkaſſes: <hi>Death</hi> ſerved himſelf ſo faſt, that the Priſon could ſcarſe hold the Priſoners: It might almoſt have been ſaid then of this City, as once it was of AEgypt; <hi>There was ſcarſe a houſe wherein ſome were not dead,</hi> at leaſt where there was not the fear of <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:47453:113"/>Now it hath pleaſed God to ſhew you more favour, and men now die but by ſcores; <hi>Death</hi> goeth his old pace, and takes away a few ſecretly without obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But <hi>Death</hi> is amongſt you ſtill, and ſtill will be ſo long as ſin is among you: and therefore it will not be unſeaſonable upon this occaſion for me to ſpeak, and you to hear ſomewhat that may arme you againſt this <hi>laſt</hi> and worſt <hi>Enemy, Death:</hi> which though he make not ſuch a ſtir in theſe times of leſs Mortality, yet he will certainly take us all away one by one: And who can tell but he may be amongſt the number of the hundred, or fewer hundreds that die now, as no man could tell wether he ſhould be amongſt the number of the thouſands then?</p>
               <p>Since <hi>Death</hi> therefore is alwayes an enemy, and alwayes fighteth againſt us (though not alwayes with like fury and violence) it is a part of wiſdome in us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to hear, and to practiſe that which may ſecure us againſt the danger of death. And that is taught in this Text.<lb/>
                  <q>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, If a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein (not to ſpeak any thing of the Context) I pray take notice who ſpeaks
<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> the words.</p>
               <p>The Author of truth: the Death of <hi>Death,</hi> he that can beſt tell by what means a man may ſhun the hurt of it: he that hath vanquiſhed it, and overcome the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his aſſaults: <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that hath ſlain death, and brought life and immortality to light.</hi> He giveth us this direction for the avoyding of the hurt of <hi>Death.</hi> Then obſerve the manner of his ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you:</hi> with an affirmation earneſt and redoubled. He never affirmed any thing unture, therefore that which he ſpeaks is an undoubted verity. He never ſpake any thing raſhly, therefore that which he affirmed ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a weighty thing, and of great conſequence.</p>
               <p>And laſtly obſerve (that which I only ſhall inſiſt upon) the matter of his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here comprehended in a hypothetical propoſition, which hath (as all ſuch have) two parts. An Antecedent, and a Conſequent. In the one he ſheweth the Duty to be done as a neceſſary condition for the obtaining of that which is ſpecified in the other. The firſt hath the Duty; The ſecond the benefit that floweth from the Duty. Theſe two are knit together in a moſt neceſſary conſequence. <hi>If a man keep my word, he ſhall never ſee death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee now the only,
<note place="margin">1 The duty commanded.</note> and perfect remedy againſt the evil of <hi>Death;</hi> that is, <hi>to keep the ſaying and word of Chriſt.</hi> If any would know by what means he may be ſecured againſt the terrible of all terrible things (as one calleth <hi>Death</hi>) here is a ſure and certain rule for him, and he need not doubt of it, it cometh from the mouth of Chriſt, let him <hi>keep his ſaying,</hi> and then <hi>Death</hi> ſhall never do him harm.</p>
               <p>I will firſt interpret theſe words unto you, and then make them good by Scripture and Reaſon and then apply them, and commit my ſelf and you, and all at laſt to the bleſſing of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt then,
<note place="margin">Meaning of the worsd.</note> when our Saviour Chriſt ſaith; <hi>If a man:</hi> we muſt conceive him to mean generally, at leaſt indefinitely, <hi>If any man whatſoever:</hi> for ſo it pleaſeth him to in large his promiſe in the redoubling of the word, that no man may have cauſe to ſay he is excluded, except he exclude himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Keep my ſayings.</hi> Here firſt I muſt ſhew you what is meant by <hi>ſayings:</hi> and then what it is to keep thoſe ſayings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Saying,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What is meant by the ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>or words of Chriſt,</hi> is, <hi>the doctrine of the Goſpel, the Covenant of Grace;</hi> which by an excellency is called His: becauſe by it he bringeth <hi>life and immortality to light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Doctrine of the Goſpel.</note> (as I ſaid before) which in former times was hid as it were in the dark, and not made known ſo publikely to the ſons of men. The Gentiles knew little or nothing of it. The <hi>Jewes</hi> knew what they knew with much darkneſs and obſcurity. He that was (almoſt) the firſt Preacher of this Goſpel in clear terms without any vail or darkneſs (<hi>John Baptiſt</hi>) who was as it were between both, he <pb n="213" facs="tcp:47453:113"/>did delives this doctrine not ſo darkly as the Prophets before him, nor ſo clearly, as after it was by our bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> and thoſe that ſucceeded him. Therefore I ſay, it is the <hi>Saying</hi> of Chriſt by an excellency, becauſe he did in a manner firſt begin to teach and declare the ſame, in the cleareneſs and ſweetneſs thereof: and he ſent his Apoſtles abroad to make it plain and manifeſt to all the world, <hi>that a man may run and read it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And His likewiſe it is called, becauſe he is the Author of it, for he is the worker of that ſalvation which it declareth to us.</p>
               <p>Now, his <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel</hi> hath two parts.</p>
               <p>The firſt acquainting us with our miſery.
<note place="margin">Two parts of the Goſpel.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond with the Remedy.</p>
               <p>For as the Bond and Acquittance ſpecific the debt,
<note place="margin">1. Shewing out raiſery.</note> but to different purpoſes, the one to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Debtor to the payment, the other to abſolve and acquit him: even ſo the Law and the Goſpel both declare the miſery of man, the one to tye it faſt upon him, the other to help him the better to leaſe it from him. The Phyſitian intreateth of the ſickneſs as well as the Cure, but of the ſickneſs alone for the cures ſake: The Judge paſſeth a ſentence of condemnation, and then largly rehearſeth the crime and puniſhment due to the offender: the Pardon likewiſe makes mention of the fault, and the puniſhment, but in a different manner, and to a different end. So the Goſpel declareth mans miſery, and borroweth ſo much of the Law, that may lay down our wretched eſtate in our ſelves, and ſo draw in that which is the main and principal part of it, the remedy of our ſouls. And this part of the Goſpel the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuccinctly delivereth in a few words,
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.63.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>All have ſinned, and are come ſhort of the glory of God: All have ſinned,</hi> and <hi>All have ſinned</hi> in ſuch a ſhort, and meaſure, and degree, that they are fallen <hi>ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> by which the Apoſtle (I think) meaneth, life Eternal: that Glory, that (had it not been for ſin) he would have beſtowed upon the ſons of men, by vertue of the firſt Covenant he made with them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">2. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt this miſery.</note> the words of Chriſt, is concerning the Remedy, whereby a man may be helped againſt this miſery. And for that purpoſe it ſheweth us, <hi>Who helpeth us; And how he helps us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what is to be done by our ſelves, that we may obtaine and enjoy this help.</p>
               <p>The Perſon that helpeth us, is the Son, <hi>Manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> the Son of God taking our nature upon him, and cloathing himſelf in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh: <hi>the Eternal Son of the Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 The Rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> aſſuming (I ſay) the very nature of man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the unity of his Perſon, ſo becoming God and Man in the ſame Perſon, he is the ſole <hi>Redeemer, neither is there any other name under heaven by which we can be ſaved,</hi> but by his alone.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how we are redeemed.</note> it ſheweth us by what means he ſaveth us: as the Apoſtle ſpeaks plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the next verſe to that I ſpake of before, <hi>being juſtified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.24.</note> To the intent that he might free us from the <hi>Curſe of the Law,</hi> and wrath of God, and the danger of eternal <hi>Death,</hi> he vouchſafed to be <hi>made ſin for us,</hi> to ſatisfie the juſtice of his Father, by endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Curſe of the Law,</hi> and to accompliſh the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Law,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made (in our ſtead) <hi>under the Law;</hi> ſo he became a Propitiation for the ſins of the ſons of men, as the Apoſtle ſaith in that place. Thus Chriſt by his perfect ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made to his Father, and by that perfect <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> whereby he was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law for our ſakes, hath abſolutely and fully delivered us from the power of ſin and of <hi>Death,</hi> and performed the work of our <hi>Redemption:</hi> by vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by the merit, and worth, and value whereof we are delivered, and ſaved, and Redeemed from this <hi>Death,</hi> and from all other evils that croſſe our eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>And thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. The means how to enjoy the remedy.</note> the Goſpel ſheweth us by what means we may become partakers of this happineſs and <hi>Redemption</hi> in Chriſt: and telleth us of three things, (as it were) Conditions of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which is ratified by the bloud of Chriſt. I ſay of three things, the Conditions (on our parts) <pb n="214" facs="tcp:47453:114"/>of that Covenant, which if we do, we ſhall certainly be ſaved by the <hi>Redemption in Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is <hi>Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <note place="margin">1. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant of Grace.</note>
               <p>The ſecond is <hi>Beleeving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is our <hi>New obedience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All and each of theſe plainly expreſt in the word of God.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Repentance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Repentance.</note> it is that where with <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt began his Preaching. It is that that our <hi>Saviour</hi> commanded his Apoſtles to declare to the <hi>Jewes, Repent, for the kingdome of heaven is at hand.</hi> It is that which himſelf preached at the firſt, as Saint <hi>Mark</hi> witneſſeth,
<note place="margin">Mark 1.15.</note> chap. 1.15. It is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> began with, when he came to the Athenians,
<note place="margin">Heb: 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Acts.</hi> 17. <hi>and now he admniſheth all men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> It was the firſt of the foundations of the <hi>Doctrine of the beginning of Chriſt;</hi> that was wont to be taught in the Ancient Church, as witheſſeth the Authour to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> chap. 6. <hi>not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works,</hi> and then he proceedeth to the reſt. This <hi>Repentance</hi> is that which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth abſolutely of the ſons of men, as a condition of the new Covenant, the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> without which they cannot poſſibly be made partakers of the ſame.
<note place="margin">The parts of Repentance.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this <hi>Repentance</hi> hath four parts, every one of which is ſo needful, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it the reſt is little worth.</p>
               <p>Firſt lamenting for our ſins,
<note place="margin">Godly ſorrow for ſin.</note> and being ſorry for our iniquities, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. <hi>I will declare my iniquity, and be ſorry for my ſins.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle Saint <hi>James</hi> expreſſeth it,
<note place="margin">Pſal: 38.</note> 
                  <hi>chap.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Afflict your ſelves, mourn and weep, let your laughter be turned into ſorrow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam: 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>and your joy into tears.</hi> Therefore Chriſt you know, was ſent to <hi>Preach glad tydings to the Priſoners and Captives, and the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the priſon to the priſoners, and to bring the oyle of gladneſs to thoſe that mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Sion.</hi> A man muſt firſt be a <hi>Mourner in Sion,</hi> one that <hi>ſimiteth on his thigh,</hi> and ſaith with <hi>Jeremy, Woe to me becauſe I have ſinned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Confeſſion of ſin.</note> to this <hi>Sorrow</hi> muſt be joyned acknowledgement, and <hi>confeſſion of ſin</hi> to Almighty God,
<note place="margin">Pro: 28.</note> for ſo witneſſeth the <hi>Wiſe-man,</hi> Prov. 28. <hi>If we confeſſe and leave our ſins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal: 32: 4.</note> 
                  <hi>we ſhall have mercy.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3, 4. <hi>I ſaid I will confeſſe my ſins, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin.</hi> And Saint <hi>John</hi> telleth us in his 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.9.
<note place="margin">1 Joh: 1: 9.</note> 
                  <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, God is faithful and true to forgive us our ſins.</hi> So you ſee <hi>Confeſſion</hi> as well as ſorrow abſolutely required to obtain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. A man muſt even Arraigne, and as it were indite himſelf before God, plead guilty, acknowledg his treſpaſs whatſoever it be, and judge himſelf worthy to be deſtroyed for them, or elſe he repents not though he weep out his eyes with mourning and lamentation.
<note place="margin">Firme purpoſe of amendment.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing requiſite is, a firm purpoſe of amendment of life. Whoſoever will have God to accept his teares, and bend a favourable care to his humiliation and acknowledgement, he muſt ſo acknowledge what evil he hath already done, that he put on a ſtedfaſt purpoſe of doing ſo no more: according to the direction that our Saviour Chriſt giveth to the man that he had healed,
<note place="margin">Joh: 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. <hi>Goe thy way and ſin no more:</hi> and as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more:</hi> And therefore the Wiſe-man putteth on this part to the former, in the before alledged place, <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, and leave them, we ſhall find mercy.</hi> There muſt be (I ſay) a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled purpoſe, and a fixed flat determination in the ſoul of every man to caſt off thoſe tranſgreſſions that he hath confeſt, and to return no more to commit them, at leaſt not to allow thoſe ſins that he hath acknowledged.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">Petition for pardon in the name if Chriſt.</note> there muſt be added to the former three, or elſe they will not availe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an earneſt ſupplication to God for mercy, and forgiveneſs through the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his wel-beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt: which was wont to be <hi>craving mercy</hi> without this mentioning of Chriſt, before he was offered, and revealed to the world. But now it muſt be ſo done, as we muſt ſpecially and particularly prefer our thoughts and deſires to him, in begging mercy at his Fathers hands for his ſake alone. So <hi>David,</hi> after the numbring of the people, <hi>I have done exceeding fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.2.</note> 
                  <hi>but Lord blot out, for give the ſin of thy ſervant:</hi> So God commandeth, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. <pb n="215" facs="tcp:47453:114"/>
                  <hi>Take to you words, and ſay to the Lord, receive us graciouſly:</hi> So did <hi>David</hi> when he renewed his <hi>repentance,</hi> (and ſo muſt all men do when they begin to repent) <hi>Have mercy upon me according to the multitude of thy mercies, and blot out my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the parts of repentance. And this is the firſt thing required at our hands, as the condition of the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> without which we can never obtain life eternal: And this repentance conſiſteth of <hi>ſorrow</hi> for ſin, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of it to God, with a firm purpoſe of amendment, and earneſt petition of pardon, for the ſake of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And this is ſuch a Doctrine as the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Repentance only taught in the Goſpel.</note> the Law, never taught to the ſons of men: Nay, verily it will not admit it: the Law ſcorns (as it were) to admit repentance, for it excludeth ſin: <hi>Repentance</hi> implieth ſin in all the degrees and kinds, therefore it is far from accepting <hi>Repentance:</hi> if thou haſt once broke the Law, repent, or not repent; amend, or nor amend; be ſorry, or not ſorry; thou ſhalt never be pardoned or forgiven: It is a rough and ſtern School-maſter, that will whip and ſcourge offending children, though they crave pardon never ſo much: It is a rough Creditour that will throttle the Debtour, and caſt him into Priſon though he confeſs the debt, and be never ſo importunate in asking favour and patience.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> it is a ſweet Doctrine, a comfortable Doctrine. Thou haſt ſinned, oh man, and broken the Law, and fallen from the favour of God, and all poſſibility of ſalvation in thy ſelf: but come, be ſorry for thy ſin, acknowledg it to thy Maker; reſolve to run on in it no longer, cry to him for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of it;
<note place="margin">Mans repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance tends to the honour of Gods juſtice.</note> he will graciouſly pardon thee. This is a ſweet Doctrine you ſee, full of comfort and conſolation: yet it is a Doctrine that tendeth to the honour of the Juſtice of God, as well as to the honour of his grace and love: the Lord could not preſcribe other conditions for receiving us to favour, but that we ſhould repent. What Judg would ſo abuſe mercy, as having paſt the ſentence of death upon a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactour, will yet pardon him, and ſave him from the halter, if he be not ſorry for his crime, and come and intreat for mercy and favour, and confeſs that he hath offended, and promiſe never to do ſo again? there is no mercy and pardon for ſuch a one, becauſe mercy muſt not oppoſe Juſtice, though it may ſomewhat (as we may ſay) mitigate Juſtice. The bloud of Chriſt if it were ſhed ten thouſand times over, it could never corrupt the Juſtice of God: it may ſatisfie it, but not corrupt it: now the Juſtice of God were corrupted, if it ſhould admit an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and hard-hearted ſinner to favour, and beſtow upon him remiſſion of ſins and life everlaſting, that would never leave it, nor forſake it, nor be ſorry for it, but ſtill go on to offend God, and trample under foot his authority: this being coutrary to Juſtice in the very nature and eſſence of Juſtice, it cannot poſſibly be effected, no not by the ſhedding of the bloud of Chriſt: the bloud of Chriſt is of that vallue, that it ſatisfieth the Juſtice of God, and cauſeth him upon the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and humiliation of a ſinner, to receive him to grace and favour.</p>
               <p>You ſee now what is the firſt part of the Condition required on our ſide for the obtaining of life by Chriſt, that is <hi>Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is, Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This we are taught every where:
<note place="margin">2: Faith.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou beleeve in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the trembling Jaylour) <hi>thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John: 6: 29.</note> And (ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) <hi>this is the work of God, that ye beleeve on him whom he hath ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This beleeving on <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deſinit on of Faith.</note> is I ſuppoſe nothing elſe bnt a ſtaying, and reſting, and depending, and relying upon the merits and ſatisfaction of our bleſſed Saviour, by the vertue and merit thereof to obtain remiſſion of ſins, and eternal life, and all good things promiſed in the <hi>New covenant</hi> at the hands of God. He that goeth quite out of himſelf, forgetteth all his own actions, caſteth behind him whatſoever ſeemed good in him, and wholly claſpeth on Chriſt, and cleaveth to him, ſtaies on him, reſteth on him for the remiſſion of ſins, and for the favour of God, and for grace and ſalvation, this man beleeveth in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and this man performs that duty which makes him one with Chriſt; that cauſeth him to become a member of <pb n="216" facs="tcp:47453:115"/>that myſtical body whereof Chriſt is the head: and that cauſeth him to be one with the Father, and to be the child of God, <hi>for by faith we are become the children of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> the Law doth not teach,
<note place="margin">Faith only taught in the Goſpel.</note> the former <hi>Covenant</hi> would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cect: What? to bring to the Law, the Righteouſneſs of another, the ſatisfaction of another, and to truſt upon that to be entertained and received, the Law rejects it. Thou muſt pay thy ſelf, in thy own perſon, and with thy own goods, thou muſt yeeld perfect obedience to the Law, and fully accompliſh it in thy own perſon: it will not receive payment of another for thee: it will not accept ſatisfaction of the righteouſneſs of another on thy behalf.</p>
               <p>But, oh the ſweetneſs of the Doctrine of the Goſpel. If we have a Treaſurer that is able, and willing to pay the debt, that will tender and make payment of it, we ſhall be accepted for his ſake; ſo that we give him the glory of reſting upon this pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be not ſo abſurd as to mix any action of our own to that payment, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e hath made fully and compleatly for us. This is a Doctrine of ſweetneſs, and favour, and great compaſſion, that though we cannot do it of our ſelves, we ſhall be accepted, if our Surety will do it for us, ſo that we give our Surety the glory of being a prefect and able pay-maſter, and relye wholly upon his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>The laſt part of the condition on our ſide,
<note place="margin">3. New obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> is that we yeeld <hi>New obedience</hi> to the Law: Perfectly to obey it: to which we are tyed hy the former Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>But now this is the obedience of the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">How differenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired under the Law.</note> a thing far different from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Law that was formerly required in the old Covenant: there a man was tyed, and bound to obey perfectly, fully, compleatly, without any defect: In a word, he muſt pay the uttermoſt farthing; he muſt do his duty, his whole duty, in in all the parts and degrees, with all fulneſs of perfection, abſolutely without any defect or want, without any imperfection at all. An impoſſible labour for corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men: a ſervice that none (all having loſt thoſe abilities that God gave man at the firſt) can ever reach to. But then cometh the ſweet Goſpel, the Doctrine of grace and favour, of tender compaſſion, and faith thus; <hi>If thou wilt conſent to obey, thou ſhalt eate the good things of the Land: If you mortifie the deeds of the body by the ſpirit, you ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. But if you (though never ſo much in ſhew under the Covenant of Grace) <hi>live after the fleſh, you ſhall die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye ſee, <hi>New Obedience</hi> is required abſolutely as a Condition of the Goſpel, for the obtaining of everlaſting happineſs, for the eſcaping of Death: and Saint <hi>John</hi> faith; <hi>If we walk in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the bloud of Chriſt ſhall purge us from all ſin:</hi> ſo that this <hi>walking in the light,</hi> and <hi>New Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> is obſolutely required of all thoſe that intend to be made partakers of Chriſt and his benifits: they muſt give up their ſouls and bodies as inſtruments of his glory, and not ſerve ſin any longer <hi>in the luſts thereof:</hi> they muſt not <hi>give their members as weapons of unrighteouſneſs</hi> to ſin, but live as becometh them that are one with Chriſt, mortifying all the luſts of the fleſh, and quicken themſelves, or being quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, to parctiſe all good things required in his word, and to obey all his commands, which was firſt written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, and then in <hi>Tahles of ſtone.</hi> This <hi>New Obedience</hi> is the ſame in ſubſtance that was required in the former Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but now with a gracious acceptation of endeavour after perfection, inſtead of perfection: the former tyed us to the obedience of all that was required, in all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and then promiſing acceptance; but the obedience that the Goſpel requires, is ſtriving to this perfection in truth and ſincerity, deſiring and labouring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, in putting out our ſelves towards it, and then promiſing acceptance through the perfection of Chriſt, in and by which our imperfections are done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>Now (Brethren) you underſtand what this <hi>ſaying</hi> of the Lord Chriſts is, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the keeping of which we muſt be ſecured (if we be ſecured) from the hurt of Death.</p>
               <p>What is it now to <hi>Keep the ſaying of Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:47453:115"/>It is to inform our Judgements in the underſtanding of theſe truths, and aſſent to them as truths, and to practiſe and follow them, to do the duties which we have heard, to practiſe the Doctrine of <hi>Repentunce,</hi> and <hi>Beleeving,</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs our Saviour doth proclaim it thus, <hi>Repent and beleeve the Goſpel:</hi> but for the more clear explaining of it, we make new <hi>Obedience</hi> a thing of it ſelf, and not included in the <hi>Doctrine of Repentance:</hi> for it is an act of that whereof <hi>Repentance</hi> is a reſolute wiſhing and deſiring. A man cannot poſſibly reſt on Chriſt for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till he hath ſo asked pardon, as he reſolveth an amendment: and when he hath this reſolution, and relyeth on Chriſt for the pardon of his ſin, then from him he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth power to amendment of life, and ſo his purpoſe cometh to action, and his deſire to execution. Thus alone theſe two things differ as far as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, this is the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> and to keep it, is to know, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and follow it, to beleeve and obey: as Chriſt faith, <hi>If you know theſe things;</hi> there is one part of the duty, <hi>happy are you if you do them:</hi> there is a ſecond, for they can never be done, except they be done as known. And thus I have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the firſt part of the Propoſition, namely, the <hi>Antecedent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us ſay ſomewhat of the latter too,
<note place="margin">2. The benefit.</note> the benefit that followeth upon the former duty, and for the obtaining of which the former duty is neceſſary, namely, <hi>that he ſhall never ſee death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is it to ſee <hi>Death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what <hi>Death</hi> is meant here?</p>
               <p>To ſee good things in the Scripture phraſe,
<note place="margin">What it is to ſee Death.</note> is as much oftentimes as to enjoy them, to have the benefit and commodity of them, to receive them, to entertain them: <hi>Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God;</hi> that is, no man ſhall enjoy God: <hi>Bliſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for they ſhall ſee God;</hi> that is, thay ſhall enjoy God.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, to ſee a thing that is tearmed Evil, is to be annoyed with it, to have the hurt of it lying upon a man, and preſſing him down: as they in <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let us go into Egypt, where we ſhall not ſee ſword or famine;</hi> meaning, that they ſhould not be purſued by war, and want of things needful: ſo that by ſeeing evil, is meant the evil lying upon one, and annoying and hurting one: and ſo I ſuppoſe it is meant here.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What Death is here meant.</note> is meant, Natural, and (as we may tearm it.) ſupernatural, and eternal Death: For the <hi>keeping of Chriſts ſayings,</hi> ſo freeth men from the latter, as they never come neer it: and ſo freeth them from the former, as they never dread to be under the power of the latter. And the firſt Death of the outward man, which is the ſeparation of the Body from the Soul, it is no <hi>Death</hi> if it ſeparate not both from God, which it can never do, <hi>if a man keep the ſayings of Chriſt:</hi> therefore though his body (that <hi>keepeth the ſayings of Chriſt</hi>) be took from his ſoul, yet he <hi>ſeeth not death</hi> ſo as to have any hurt by it, he feeleth no ill by it: nay, it is good to him, for it is a paſſage from miſery to reſt and felicity.</p>
               <p>Thus ye have theſe words as faithfully interpreted to you, as I know how.</p>
               <p>And now I will make proof of this Doctrine thus explicated, namely, that thus to <hi>keep Chriſts ſayings,</hi> to know and follow the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> is the only ſure way to eſcape the danger and hurt of <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> acknowledgeth as much,
<note place="margin">Joh. 6.68.</note> when he ſaid to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he had the <hi>words of Eternal life,</hi> then he that <hi>keepeth them</hi> is certainly ſafe againſt the hurt of <hi>Death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act 5.20.</note> So the Angel ſpeaks to the Apoſtles whom the Phariſees had impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, when he brought them forth of Priſon, he biddeth them ſpeak to the people <hi>the words of this life:</hi> ſince Chriſts Doctrine is the word of life, it muſt needs follow, that the keeping thereof is a perfect <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt the poyſon of Death. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> when he gave an account to the reſt of the Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Acts 11.14.</note> and the brethren of <hi>Judea,</hi> of his going to the Gentiles, he ſaith that an Angel appointed <hi>Cornelius</hi> to ſend for him, <hi>that he might ſpeak words to him, whereby himſelf and his family, <pb n="218" facs="tcp:47453:116"/>ſhould be ſaved:</hi> and thoſe words which cauſe a man to be ſaved, you know will give him freedome enough from Death.</p>
               <p>Thus I have proved the point by expreſſe Texts:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> and there are two reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>The firſt is delivered by the Apoſtle Saint <hi>John</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle, and ſecond Chapter,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.24.</note> where he faith, <hi>let that abide in you, which you have heard from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> (that is the Doctrine of the Goſpel which Chriſt taught, his ſayings,) <hi>if that remain in you, you alſo ſhall continue in the Son, and in the Father.</hi> He that hath fellowſhip with the Son, and with the Father can never ſee <hi>Death,</hi> for God is the fountain of life: therefore thoſe that are one with him, and continue in him, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee <hi>Death</hi> no more then he can be overwhelmed with darkneſs, that is where the Sun ſhineth fully; no more then the body can be dead, as long as it hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the ſoul: ſo thoſe in whom the word of Chriſt remaineth and ſtayeth, they are aſſured that they ſhall remain with the Father and the Son: and therefore being united to that that is life, God the Father, and the Son, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ever they ſhould be hurt by the firſt, or ever at all taſte of the laſt <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> the <hi>Word</hi> of Chriſt freeth him in whom it remaineth from the power and hurt of ſin, bringing to him remiſſion of ſins, and ſanctification. And being free from ſin the cauſe of Death, it is eaſie to conjecture that he ſhall be freed from Death it ſelf. Let a mans Debt be ſatisfied, and let the favour of the Prince be obtained, and a Pardon granted, the Priſon ſhall never hold him long, he ſhall not be brought to the place of Execution, but when his guives are knocked off, he is ſet at liberty: ſo when we have obtained power againſt ſin by the powerful work of the Spirit of God, which alwayes at the ſame time doth bend the heart of man to reſt on Chriſt for ſalvation, and heartily to indevour to walk before him in holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: when I ſay, we are thus freed from the power and guilt of ſin, it is impoſſible that Death ſhould lay hold upon us as his priſoner, to carry us to the dungeon of Hell, and to hold us under the wrath of God, and that fiery indignation of his that cauſeth Hell to be Hell. Therefore certainly the words of Chriſt are an undoubted truth, and we muſt reſt upon them without all diſtruſt and wavering, that <hi>he that keepeth his ſayings ſhall never ſee death,</hi> and that the knowledge, and beleeving, and obeying, the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> is the only ſure way to eſcape the hurt and ill of Death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Let us make ſome Application of this Doctrine to our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">

Incitatton to thankfulneſs.</note> to ſtir us up to a right hearty thankfulneſs unto Almighty God, that is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to caſt our times and dayes, into that age, and thoſe places where the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> this <hi>Saying</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour is ſo clearly, and plainly, and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid open to you; and frequently and earneſtly preſt upon your ſouls: where the Lord cometh to declare unto you the way to life; where he ſcoreth you out a path, that will bring you quite out of the clutches and danger of Death, this is the happineſs of our preſent Age, and place where we live, and this whole kingdom too. The grace and mercy, and favour of our loving God hath ſo diſpoſed of us, that we do not live in times of Paganiſme and darkneſs, where there was no news of Chriſt: that we live not in places of Popiſh darkneſs, where the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel</hi> is ſo mixed and darkned with tricks and devices of their own, that they cannot ſee Chriſt clearly. It is our happineſs, I ſay, that we do not live in thoſe places, and times, where either Paganiſme or Popery with their darkneſs covered Chriſt from us, and cauſed us that we could not clearly ſee or hear him, and ſo not <hi>keep his ſayings:</hi> But now grace is offered, light is tendered to us: we may be ſaved, we may eſcape the danger of damnation, if the fault be not ſolely and wholly in our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, and wilfulneſs, and neglect, and abuſe of the means that God hath afforded us.</p>
               <p>The heathen men that have not heard of Chriſt cannot poſſibly attain to life, (as far as we can judge by the Scripture.) And it is very difficult for the Papiſts (that hear ſo darkly, and are told of the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> with ſo many ſophiſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to come to be ſaved. But for us that have the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel</hi> ſo plainly, <pb n="219" facs="tcp:47453:116"/>and carefully taught us, and revealed unto us, we may be ſaved, and may eaſily ſee the way to obtain ſalvation.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Reprehenſion.</note> I beſeech you let me take boldneſs to reprove (I fear) a great number of you of a ſin, whereof I will make it appear you are guilty. Men there are that make large promiſes to themſelves that they ſhall never be damned, they ſhall not go to Hell, they hope <hi>Death</hi> ſhall not have power to dragg them from this world to the place of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Thou hopeſt ſo; Come, render a reaſon of thy hope. To hope without a ground, is to deceive ones ſelf with extream folly. As for example: there are a number of priſoners in <hi>New-gate,</hi> or in ſome other Priſon: ſhould they hope for ſome man of great wealth to pay their debts, and ſave them from hanging: ſhould they not be arrant fools to hope, except they could ſhew ſome ground for their hope, and ſome evidence for their expecting of ſuch a kindneſs? Thou that hopeſt, <hi>thou ſhall never ſee Death;</hi> come anſwer God in thy conſcience: doſt thou <hi>keep the ſaying of Chriſt or no?</hi> Where is the knowledge of the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel?</hi> Doſt thou beleeve that which concerns thee touching thy miſery, and ſo apply that to thy ſelf, to make thee a penitent ſinner? Doſt thou beleeve the Doctrin concerning the <hi>Remedy,</hi> and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that to thy ſelf, to make thee perfect thy repentance, by being not only grieved for ſin, but taking boldneſs to confeſſe it, and ask pardon, and by framing thy ſelf in thankfulneſs to amendment of life, and new obedience? Doſt thou (I ſay) know this Doctrine, and ſo know it as to practiſe it? Hope and ſpare not; the more thou hopeſt, the better thy hope is; the ſtronger and ſurer it is, the more thou glorifieſt God, and the more it ſhall comfort thee.</p>
               <p>But oh unhappy man, if thou findeſt not in thy ſelf the care and power in ſome meaſure to do theſe things; curſed be thy hopes, becauſe they be diſgracefull to Almighty God, tending to make him a lyar, and an unjuſt perſon; and becauſe they are dangerours to thy own ſoul, tending to rock thee aſleep in the cradle of ſecurity. Curſed be thoſe unſound and ſandy-built hopes of moſt men, that never yet applied themſelves to confeſſe and lament their ſins; that never applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to crave pardon, and to reſolve upon amendment; that never ſtudied to throw themſelves into the Armes of Gods mercy in Chriſt for pardon; that never intended to <hi>mortifie the deads of the body,</hi> and to ſubdue <hi>the fleſh with the luſts thereof:</hi> and yet they hope they ſhall not be damned: thou maiſt as well hope that the Divel ſhall come out of Hell into Heaven, as thou to go out of earth into Heaven. If thy hope be not grounded upon the workings of theſe graces, becauſe thou findeſt thy ſelf penitent; becauſe thou findeſt thy ſelf careful to ſtrive to reſt wholly upon Chriſt for ſalvation; becauſe thou findeſt thy ſelf induſtrious in the ſtudy of newneſs of life: except (I ſay) thy hope be thus grounded, it is the vaineſt thing in the world, and it will never do the good at the laſt hour.</p>
               <p>Brethren give me leave to tell you that there are two Goſpels in the world: the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Goſpel of <hi>Belzebub</hi> (as I may call it) the Goſpel of the Divel, that comes from Hell, and tendeth to bring men thither. Chriſts Goſpel is, <hi>Repent and beleeve, and obey, and be ſaved.</hi> The Divels goſpelis: ſay you beleeve, make your ſelvesimagine that you have faith, and then never care for repentance and obedience, and you ſhall be ſaved. Chriſts Goſpel is ſummed up thus by the Prophets, <hi>Return to him and live.</hi> But the Divils goeth thus; Aſſure thy ſelf thou ſhalt live, though thou care not for repentance. Oh let not the Divel <pb n="220" facs="tcp:47453:117"/>beguile you with that falſe and counterfeit Goſpel of his, whoſoever leaneth to it, ſhall find it like the Authour of it, <hi>a Lyar;</hi> and when he hath truſted to it, that confidence and hope of his ſhall be as the Spiders web, the Beeſome of deſtruction ſhall ſweep it and him down to the depth of Hell: <hi>Death</hi> ſhall have dominion over him, and carry him from this preſent world to the region of darkneſs, into eternal torment: he ſhall <hi>ſee Death</hi> in the grimneſs and terribleneſs of it, he ſhall feel it in all the extremity that the wrath of God can inflict upon the children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3 Exhortation.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I have to command and require you in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you apply your ſelves to a thing tending ſo much to the honour of him, and to the commodity and comfort of your own ſouls.</p>
               <p>I have ſhewed you that Jeſus Chriſt hath revealed a way how you ſhould eſcape the danger of Death eternal, and the hurt of Death natural. I beſeech you now fall a doing one while, as you have been buſied in hearing. To what purpoſe is it that you flock to hear Sermons, and throng to receive the Word, except you lay it up in your hearts, and apply your ſelves to practiſe: If thou haſt not begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, now begin: if thou haſt begun before, now reſolve to proceed with more life and courage: Either begin or perſiſt in the practiſe of the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou haſt not repented, I require thee in the name of the living God, to make this hour the firſt beginning of thy repentance: and apply thy ſelf to lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that work, before thou lay thy head to ſleep. Go and call to mind thy ſins, and make thy cheeks wet, at leaſt thy heart heavy for the multitude of thy great offences: down on thy knees in thy Cloſet; make thy confeſſion of them to God, ſigh for them, mourn for them, labour to weep for them, afflict thy ſoul with great ſorrow and remorſe: then cry for pardon and remiſſion: as the thieſe begs at the bar for mercy, ſo do thou for the forgiveneſs of thy ſins through Chriſt Jeſus; and put upon thy ſelf a firm reſolution, and ſtedfaſt purpoſe to go on no more in the wayes of wickedneſs, to practiſe groſſe ſins no more, nor no more to allow any ſin that thou knoweſt to be a ſin, though it be never ſo ſmall.</p>
               <p>Doe thus (my brethren) and then you may and will, (it will follow almoſt of it ſelf) reſt on Chriſt for ſalvation. He that ſo ſeeth his own ſins, as unfeignedly to lament for them, and to judge himſelf before God, (if he apprehend the truth of the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi>) he cannot for his life but come on amain, and throw himſelf down before Chriſt, to imbrace, and receive, and entertain him, and lie in his Boſome.</p>
               <p>And that man cannot for his life, when he ſeeth the ſweetneſs of the grace of God in Chriſt, but reſolve to obey him, and determin to walk in the wayes of holineſs, and take pains, and uſe induſtry for the overcoming of all ſin: and by the vertue of Chriſt he ſhall proſper in this.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you therefore ſet your ſelves awork about this great buſineſs, to get <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>New Obedience:</hi> it is much more needful then ſleep, then meat, then attire: there is nothing in the world ſo requiſite for thy welfare as theſe things. Scrape thou riches together in the ſame quantity that <hi>Solomon</hi> did, and ten thouſands times more, yet thou ſhalt <hi>ſee Death</hi> once within a hundred, or half a hundred years. Get wiſdome, yet thou ſhalt <hi>ſee Death</hi> after a few years. Take pleaſure with as much greedineſs as he did once, when he forgat himſelf for a ſpace, yet thou ſhalt <hi>ſee death.</hi> Theſe things that the fooliſh world hunts after with ſo much earneſtneſs of deſire, will not ſecure thee from the ſight of the <hi>King of feares, Death,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> calleth it. But if thou once get Faith, and Repentance, and new obedience, then thou haſt obtained that, that all the riches, and honour, and pleaſures, and learning, or whatſoever ſeemeth deſirable in the world, will not help their poſſeſſors to.</p>
               <p>What will you do? (brethren) Grovel ſtill on the earth? and ſtill be mad after back and belly? Or will you now begin to think, I muſt die, I muſt ſhake hands with that diſmal enemy, pale-faced Death, that is able to ſtrike terrour into the ſtrongeſt heart, and amazement into the ſtouteſt ſoul that is not well confirmed: and if this <hi>Death</hi> find me deſtitute of true <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>New Obedience,</hi> it <pb n="221" facs="tcp:47453:117"/>will ſeize upon me, and dragg me before the Judgement ſeat of God, where I ſhall be <hi>Henced</hi> away with a malediction and curſe, and be forced to take my place with the Divel and his Angels in unquenchable flames? Oh what ſhall I do then to ſecure my ſelf from the great, from the ſtrong, arme of death? I will repent, now I will begin, Lord draw me, help me that I may do it. I will beleeve now; Lord do thou work Faith that requireſt it. I will obey, Lord inable me to preform ſuch needful duties as thou commandeſt me. Shall this be your practice when you come home? Will you thus ſtudy to practiſe <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Obedience?</hi> and ſtudy to cry and call for it, and uſe all your endeavour? Or what will you do: will you be as idle and careleſs, as negligent and ſlothful in making after theſe graces as before? Will you be as greedy of the tranſitory vanities of this life, as in former times? Oh abuſe not the word of God. If thou go out of the Church without a full purpoſe to apply thy ſelf from hence forward, either to begin, or to proceed in the practiſe of the <hi>ſaying of Chriſt;</hi> Curſed be thou in thy hearing, curſed be that hour that thou haſt ſpent, and curſed be thy misbeſtowed labour, thou diſſembling hypocrite. But if thou labour to practiſe this of Chriſt, namely to <hi>keep his ſayings,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> to repent, to beleeve, and to obey, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed art thou in thy hearing, and in thy doing, and in thy obedience, happy is the time and the place, and all things that concur together to draw thee to ſo needful a work.</p>
               <p>I pray (<hi>Brethren</hi>) ſet not your labour upon gold and ſilver, and money, and traſh, not upon the pleaſures and delights, and contentments of the world, not on any other thing; but mainly and principally above all things let your chief care be for <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> If you ſtrive for theſe things earneſtly, and heartily, and conſtantly, as ſure as the Lord is in heaven, he will beſtow them upon you, and with them, the benefit of benefits, <hi>Freedome from Death.</hi>

Conſolation</note> that <hi>keep theſe ſayings of Chriſt.</hi> Let them be of good comfort: if their capital enemy the <hi>King of fears,</hi> and the King of Afflictions be held from a poſſiblity of doing them harm, nothing can harme them. He that <hi>Death</hi> cannot hurt, paine cannot hurt, poverty and diſgrace cannot hurt, nothing can hurt him. You know if the King of an Army be reconciled to a place, he will keep his Souldiers from ſpoyling, and burning, and deſtroying that place. If <hi>Death</hi> be put out of power to do thee hurt, and God be reconciled in Chriſt, becauſe thou <hi>keepeſt the ſaying</hi> of Chriſt, nothing can hurt thee, thou art the happieſt man under the Sun. Why ſhould the poor, ſad, afflicted, grieved, mourning, lamenting Saints of God envie them that are rich, and jolly, and merry worldlings, any of their pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits? any of thoſe things wherewith they like <hi>Idiots</hi> make themſelves laugh at? What? hath not God given thee better things then he, that thou ſhouldeſt murmure and whine, and weep for want of them? art thou ſtill complaining for want of them?</p>
               <p>Remember what Saint <hi>James</hi> faith, <hi>Let the brother of low degree</hi> (that is abaſed and diſpiſed in the world) <hi>rejoyce, yea, rejoyce with great boaſting, and glory, in his Exaltation.</hi> This is the exaltation of the Saints, Chriſt writing his <hi>ſayings</hi> in their hearts, and inclining them through the operation of his Spirit, and the powerful work of his Word, to repent and beleeve, hath freed them from the danger of Death, and intereſſed them into eternal happineſs, and that bliſſe that no tongue can expreſſe, nor no heart conceive. This is thy happineſs: it is not to be rich, or to be great, for theſe cannot deliver the owner from the hurt of Death natural, nor from the danger of Death eternal. But to have <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> this is riches and exaltation: for he that hath them ſhall not alone eſcape the Dungeon of eternal darkneſs, but be advanced to the Palace of everlaſting felicity.

                  </note> It may be in thy heart of all thy complaining, and thou maiſt have it for all theſe exclaymings againſt thy ſelf. Tell me, when thou findeſt thoſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereof, and for which thou ſpeakeſt againſt thy ſelf, Doſt thou allow them or not? doſt thou confeſſe them, and lament them or not? I confeſſe them indeed, but with ſuch a finall deal of ſorrow. Is it ſuch a ſorrow as draws thee to God? and drives thee out of thy ſelf? ſuch as makes thee to fall before him, and judge thy ſelf worthy to be damned, and ſubmit to his Juſtice? Is it ſuch a ſorrow as makes thee confeſſe, and then purpoſe amendment? Such as makes thee cry to him for power and ſtrength? ſuch as makes thee reſt on him for ability? Doſt thou determine ſtill, ſtill to amend that that ſtill troubleth thee? Doſt thou ſtill continue to fight with the luſts of thy fleſh by the ſpiritual weapons that God hath ordained for thee? I ſay to thee, thy <hi>Repentance,</hi> thy <hi>Faith,</hi> thy <hi>New Obedience</hi> may be true, though it be weak. When a man hath a ſhaking Palſey hand, it is a hand. A ſick weake man that lies crying, oh, oh, that can ſcarſe turn himſelf between the ſheets, is a man, a living man. A poor child that is new born, and hath nothing that diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth reaſon almoſt, but the ſhape of a man? that poor child is a reaſonable creature. <hi>Faith</hi> beginneth with weake apprehenſions, and faint leanings on Chriſt. Deep godly ſorrow, and other parts of <hi>Repentance,</hi> may begin many times with little And amendment of life begins ſometimes at a low ſoundation, at ſmall ſins. If it be true, and ſincere, and conſtant: if thou go on and continue in a courſe of daily renewing thy <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſtirring by Gods means to get the increaſe of theſe graces, and to be upright and ſincere in them: thou art bleſſed in them notwithſtaading thy weakneſſe: take comfort in a little, and be thankful for it: God will give more, and the only way to get more, is to take comfort in a good meaſure in what thou haſt: and the way to take comfort, is to labour to increaſe theſe graces.</p>
               <p>Let not the weak, troubled, ſeebled Chriſtian be troubled in mind, as if he had no grace, becauſe he hath but a little: as if he did not at all keep Chriſts ſayings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he keepeth them but a little. He is a ſcholler in the School that beginneth at Chriſt-Croſſe-row (as we call it.) And he is entred into the Colledge, that beginneth but in a low book, with the firſt rudiments of Logick. And he is a member of the Family that began to be an Apprentiſe but yeſterday, and comes not to a deep knowledge of his Art and Miſtery, but is glad to do ſorry work.</p>
               <p>Beleeve it (brethren) there may be great conceits of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and beleeving, and obeying, that may make a man good in his own eyes, and be altogether falſe. There may be a ſmall meaſure of <hi>Repentance;</hi> but if one be humbled in the ſmalneſs of that meaſure, and labour, and deſire, and pray, and begg for the increaſe of that meaſure, and take pains to ediſie himſelf in it, by the means of God: then it is true and upright, and ſhall ſave him. Therefore rejoyce.</p>
               <p>It is not with the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> as it was with that of Works. The Covenant of Works, the Law required perfection of Obedience to all the things preſcribed: a man muſt not only love God, but love God perfectly. But the Goſpel ſatisfieth it ſelf with accepting truch of endeavour to the thing required. If there be <hi>Repentance,</hi> though it be not in the full perfection: if thou <hi>beleeve,</hi> though not with the fulleſt meaſure of beleeving: If thou <hi>Obey,</hi> though not in the higheſt degree of obedience: this Goſpel, this ſweet, this favourable gracious Doctrine giveth thee conſolation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Go home therefore comforted in the beginnings, and reſolved to proceed: and know that thou ſhalt enjoy that which Chriſt hath promiſed, freedome from damnation, <hi>thou ſhalt never ſee Death.</hi>

The ſin of young men.</note> They give over themſelves to an inordinate car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Joy.</hi> This Joy is ſet out from the time of it: <hi>the dayes of their youth.</hi> From the cauſe of it, their <hi>hearts chear them.</hi> From the kinds of it, they <hi>walk in the wayes of their hearts, and after the ſight of their eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. The Cure.</note> the Medicine with which <hi>Solomon</hi> would heal young men of this inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate carr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>al Joy, is this, <hi>Know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that for all theſe things, God will bring thee into Judgment:</hi> that is, it is a moſt divine and infallible truth, that every one ſhould know and acknowledg, that whatſoever ſins they commit in their youth, without repentance, they muſt undergo the dreadful <hi>Judgment</hi> of God becauſe of them.</p>
               <p>Thus (as briefly as I can) I have opened the words unto you. Though I might inſiſt on many doctrines, yet not witſtanding, I will only handle theſe two.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſhall be that which ariſeth from the firſt part of the Text; what young men do; what their fault is: For (as I ſaid) it is an Ironnical conceſſion, not declaring what young men ſhould do, but what they do. The doctrine is thus much.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the ſin of young men to rejoyce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately.</note>
                  <lb/>
                  <hi>That it is the ſin of young men to rejoyce inordinately, and carnally, in the dayes of their youth, to walk after their hearts, and the ſight of their eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We read concerning the old world, that <hi>they were eating and drinking, and marrying, and giving in marriage:</hi> altogether ſottiſh and ſenſual, till the wrath of God came in the flood and ſwept them away. Now leſt any ſhould ſuppoſe that this were the fault of old age only,
<note place="margin">Gen. 6.11.</note> the Scripture ſheweth, that <hi>all fleſh had corrupted their way before God,</hi> Gen. 6.11.</p>
               <p>Iſa. 22.14.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 22.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die.</hi> It is thought by learned Divines, that this ſpeech was not ſo much the language of Age, as of the youth in Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth a caveat to the young man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. to bridle and reſtrain him from his jollity and carnal mirth.
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Remember now thy Creatour in the dayes of thy youth, while the evil day come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou ſhalt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them.</hi> And the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. <pb n="225" facs="tcp:47453:119"/>inſtructeth <hi>Timothy to flie the luſts of youth;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim 2.22</note> that is, in carnal pleaſures and paſtimes, in voluptuouſneſs and ſenſuallity,
<note place="margin">Tit. 2.6.</note> and the like. And <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Exhort young men that they be ſober minded;</hi> that is, that they leave this drunkenneſs of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in being overcome with ſenſual carnal objects and pleaſures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> (in the firſt Chapter of that book) when the young people,
<note place="margin">Job. 1.</note> his Suns and Daughters met together to feaſt, he was afraid leſt they ſhould be miſguided in this kind, therefore the holy man in a godly care and thoughtfulneſs for their welfare, ſacrificed to God, to make attonement for their ſin.</p>
               <p>Let us a little conſider the reaſons of this Doctrine, whence it is, that young men ſhould be ſo much miſguided in their youth.</p>
               <p>The firſt cauſe is,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> natural corruption that they have drawn by propagation from their Parents. A ſpiritual leproſie, and maladie, and diſeaſe, which as it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth (for the moſt part) againſt age by covetouſneſs, ſo it getteth ground of youth by ſenſuallity and voluptuouſneſs. This dams up the eare againſt reprooſe: this hardens the heart againſt inſtruction: and makes many young men the ſouldiers of Sathan in ſin.</p>
               <p>Again in the ſecond place.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Forgetfulneſs of Judgement, Deut: 32: 29,</note> Men in their youth forget the day of their reckoning and Judgment: they are not mindful of their latter end. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22. <hi>Oh that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end.</hi> This Precept is neglected both by youth and age: but eſpecially by thoſe of younger yeares. For they feele their bloud run warm in their veins, and they are full of ſpirits and vigour, therefore they ſuppoſe that the Grave, and the <hi>houſe of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is far off from them.</p>
               <p>Again in the third place.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Freedome from croſſes.</note> Young men are not broken by afflictions: the fallow ground is not poughed up by the preſſures of afflictons, which through the grace of God are great means to tame nature, and to ſubdue the pride of it, and to bring it to a right frame and temper. <hi>Before I was afflicted (</hi> faith <hi>David) I went a ſtray.</hi> And <hi>Ephraim</hi> faith of himſelf,
<note place="margin">Jer: 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>I was as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoak, thou chaſtiſeſt me, and I was chaſtiſed; I was aſhamed, becauſe I bore the reproach of my youth.</hi> But young men are free from aches, and pains, and ſickneſs, and ſorrow, much more then old age: and this is the reaſon why they are more licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4 Want of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual joy.</note> young men want true joy in God: therefore they betake themſelves to carnal joy. For ſure it is that a man cannot live without joy and contentment: if he have it not <hi>from the Wells of ſalvation,</hi> he will drink it out of watery and ſlimy places. Now becauſe men in their youth cannot take in the ſpiritual joy of that clear fountain, therefore they drink in the muddy waters of carnall joy.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this point is in the firſt place an Admonition to all young men,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. For Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to take notice of theſe maladies, and ſpiritual diſeaſes in themſelves. The firſt degree of our healing, is to ſee that we are ſick: and till then, Chriſt Jeſus the Phyſitian of our ſouls,
<note place="margin">1. To take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joy.</note> hath no commiſſion to do us good.</p>
               <p>Let young men obſerve in themſelves, firſt their carnal joy. <hi>Solomon</hi> here ſheweth that they rejoyce inordinately.
<note place="margin">Young mens rejoycing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This may appear to them firſt, becauſe they rejoyce not where they ought: they ſolace not themſelves in God, in whom is the fountain of joy; nor in Chriſt Jeſus,
<note place="margin">1: Becauſe it is not placed there where it ſhould be.</note> in whom is the ſpring of joy; nor in the ſacred Word, where there is the Ciſtern of Joy. Even as a bone when it is out of joynt, out of its place, it muſt needs be a diſordered bone; ſo the affections when they are miſplaced, are diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: and then our Joy, and any other affection are miſplaced, when they are not ſet upon God and Chriſt. Now if young men would deal uprightly with themſelves, they ſhould perceive that for the moſt part in their jollity and merriment they never think of God, or dream of the world to come. Nay, the ſerious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of God Almighty, would quench their joy, and make it altogether put out.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2: Becauſe it is placed there where it ſhould not be.</note> the carnalneſs of the joy of young men appeareth, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce where they ought not, in riot, in drunkenneſs, in ſurfeiting, in voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, many times in obſcenity of words and phraſes, in making jeaſts of the <pb n="226" facs="tcp:47453:120"/>word of God, in deriding their ſuperiours behind their backs. As <hi>Solomon</hi> faith of <hi>laughter, thou art mad;</hi> ſo we may ſay of this merriment, it is mad merrimemt: he is a mad man that rejoyceth in that for which, except he betake himſelf to ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bitter mourning, he cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 Becauſe it is exceſſive in lawful things.</note> the inordinateneſs of the joy of young men may appear in this; becauſe they rejoyce exceſſively in lawful things: for any joy when it is inordinate and exceſſive, it is carnal. It is lawful to rejoyce in recreations: a <hi>whetting is no let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> (as the Proverb goeth.) But for a man to let out himſelf to the hinderance of the ſervice of God, to the diſturbance of his duty to men, it is unlawful. It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to delight in the bleſſings, and comforts of God, that he affordeth us: we read of the Joy of harveſt, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. But for a man to delight in the gifts of God, more then in the giver, it is unlawfull. Now if young men examine themſelves, they ſhall find their hearts mount not up to God in their joy and jollity, and that they are exceſſive in the joy of the creature, but altogether cold, without joy of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4 Becauſe it terminates not in God.</note> the carnalneſs of the Joy of young men may well appear in this; becauſe they terminate, and conclude not their joy in God. This followeth on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for it is impoſſible that what beginneth not in God, ſhould end in God. Now when Joy beginneth in ſin, it cannot end in God, but in the Divel.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 Of their wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after their own heart.</note> let young men take notice of themſelves, how they <hi>walk after their own hearts.</hi> The heart that ſaies; Come, put away penſive thoughts: trouble not your ſelf about the day of reckoning and Judgement; enjoy the time preſent: what need this ſtrictneſs of converſation: zeal is but raſhneſs; there is no need of it; take thy ſill of pleaſures: thou haſt goods laid up for many years. Thus they Judge,
<note place="margin">Hoſea 7.</note> and thus they walk after their carnal heart. This heart is as no heart: as we read of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in <hi>Hoſea 7. He was a ſilly dove that had no heart:</hi> Certainly the heart that doth not guide men in the right way, and direct men to the fear of God, it is no heart. For as the eye that will not lead us in the right way, that performs not its office, is no eye: ſo the heart that leadeth not men to God, and to goodneſs, it is like the heart of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> it is as no heart.</p>
               <p>Again in the third place.
<note place="margin">3 Of their walking after the ſight of their eyes.</note> Let young men take notice of themſelves, how they walk after <hi>the ſight of their eyes.</hi> That is, they ſtand gazing on things temporal, and neglect things eternal: they ſee a beauty and luſtre in theſe outward things, and perceive no glory and brightneſs in Chriſt Jeſus, and in his precious Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Beloved,
<note place="margin">Iob 31.1.</note> if we follow our own heart, and our own eyes it will be thus. We ſhould rather labour with <hi>Job, to make a covenant with our eyes.</hi> Oh how few young men are there that make a bargaine and agreement with their eyes, that they
<note place="margin">Ier: 9.</note> Oh how few young men are ſhall not be as open Caſements to let ſin into the ſoul? there,
<note place="margin">Heb: 11.</note> that like <hi>Jeremy,</hi> have their eyes as <hi>fountains of water, to weep day and night</hi> for the afflictions of the people of God? Oh how few yonng men are there, that with <hi>Moſes, have an eye to the recompence of reward, that they may ſuffer affliction with the people of God, rather then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you take a ſurvey of your ſelves in theſe things. Theſe are the vices, and ſins, and deformities of young men: to be ſeen and lamented by all thoſe that hope to dwell in Gods holy Hill.</p>
               <p>The ſecond uſe of this point,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For Fxhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> is for exhortation to young men: they ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be reformed in their affections and hearts. And away, away with this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall joy: we ought to caſt it out of us.</p>
               <p>Carnal Joy:
<note place="margin">1 To abandon carnal joy.</note> will you know what the event of it will be? It will end in carnal ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and without repentance in hell it ſelf. <hi>Wo unto you</hi> (faith our Saviour Chriſt) <hi>that laugh now,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 6.26. Iob 20.6,7.</note> 
                  <hi>you ſhall weep and mourn. The triumphing of the wicked</hi> (ſaith <hi>Zophar</hi> in <hi>Job) is ſhort, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment; though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; yet he ſhall periſh as his own dung, they which have ſeen him ſhall ſay where is be? He ſhall fall away as a dream, and ſhall not be found; yea, he ſhall be chaſed away as a viſion of the night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:47453:120"/>But not to give you this only in Precept,
<note place="margin">Directions how to avoid carnal joy.</note> but alſo to ſhew you how to reform your ſelves in theſe vices, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eth bo bear ſway in young men: let me lay you down theſe few directions.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 To labour for ſorrow for ſin.</note> you muſt betake your ſelves to mourning for you ſins; as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be afflctied, and weep, and mourn, let your laughter be turned into heaviueſs.</hi> If we be not reconciled to God, if we have not aſſurance, that we are intereſted in Chriſt, there is no time for us to rejoyce, we ſhould rather betake our ſelves to bitter mourning: for the wrath of God is due unto us, and we know not how ſoon it may fall upon us,</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place:
<note place="margin">2. Conſider the vanity of things.</note> Conſider how vain all things are in which youthfull perſons rejoyce.</p>
               <p>If young men rejoyce in human wiſdome and underſtanding,
<note place="margin">1. Of humane wiſdome. Eccleſ:1:13.</note> this is a vain thing. For firſt, it is gotten with a great deal of trouble, and <hi>vexation of ſpirit:</hi> ſo faith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>I gave my heart to ſeek, and ſearch out by wiſdom, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things that are done under heaven, this ſore travel hath God given to the ſons of men to be exerciſed therewith.</hi> And (verſe 18.) <hi>in much wiſdome is much grief, and he that increaſeth knowledg, increaſeth ſorrow.</hi> God doth ſo puniſh the pride and boldneſs of the wit of men, even from the fall of our firſt Parents.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ:1:15.</note> this human wiſdome it muſt needs be a vain thing, for <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.15. <hi>that which is crooked cannot be made ſtraight, and that which is wanting cannot be numbred,</hi> by human wiſdome; The meaning is this: that the natural wiſdome of man cannot ſupply the defects of nature which are innumerable: much leſſe can it furniſh the ſoul with grace or ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is but <hi>vexation of ſpirit. Solomon</hi> though he <hi>had gotten wiſdome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and had experience more then all the Kings of Jeruſalem that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, yet</hi> (faith he) <hi>Behold this is vexation of ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">1 Cor: 1:19.</note> God will aboliſh this human wiſdome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19. <hi>I will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and will bring to nothing the underſtanding of the prudent. Where is the wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the diſputer of this world? Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdome of this world?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, all your human wiſdom, it ſhall not go down to to the Grave: it ſhall leave you when you die. <hi>There is no work, nor device, nor knowledg, nor wiſdome in the grave whether thou goeſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9:10.</note> 
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.10. This is the firſt thing in which young men oft rejoyce, they are prudent and wiſe: And you ſee that this is a vain thing.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place,
<note place="margin">2 Of worldly honour and cred it. Eccleſ: 1:16.</note> if a young man rejoyce in his honour, and credit amongſt men: this alſo is vain. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ſhewed it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.16. He declareth to us, that all the honour of the world will end in oblivion, <hi>there is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no remembrance of the wiſe, more then of the fool, for ever: for that which now is, in the dayes to come ſhall be forgotten, and how dieth the wiſe man? as the fool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if a man rejoyce in honour, and much glory, he cannot beleeve: ſo faith Chriſt,
<note place="margin">John 5:44.</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can you beleeve, ſince you ſeek honour one of another, and not the honour that cometh of God only?</hi> And it is noted to be the reaſon why many of the <hi>chief Rulers that beleeved on Chriſt did not confeſſe him,</hi> (without which faith cannot be unfeigned) <hi>becauſe they loved the praiſe of men, more then the praiſe of God,</hi> John 10.43.
<note place="margin">John 10:43.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Nay further,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5:26.</note> the Apoſtle ſheweth us that this is the cauſe of envy, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Be not deſirous of vain-glory, envying one another.</hi> Envy is a vexing affection: this vain-glory is the cauſe of this envy: whereby we ſhall pine away, when we ſee the happineſs and welfare of our brethren.</p>
               <p>Further,
<note place="margin">3 Of worldly pleaſures. Eccleſ:2:2.</note> if young men delight in pleaſures (which is the common courſe of youth) theſe alſo are vain things. <hi>I ſaid in my heart</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ.2.2.) <hi>Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleaſure: and behold this alſo is vanity.</hi> Kings that have had the greateſt wiſdome to invent them: and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt leiſure to uſe them: yet they never found full contentment in the ſame. <hi>I made <pb n="228" facs="tcp:47453:121"/>me</hi> (ſaith he verſ. 4.) <hi>great works,
<note place="margin">Verſ 4.</note> I builded me houſes; I planted me vineyards, I made me gardens and orchards, and planted trees in them of all kind of fruits, I made me pools of water, I got me ſervants and maidens; alſo I had great poſſeſſions of great and ſmall cattel, above all that were in Jeruſalem before me; I got me men-ſingers, and women-ſingers, and the delights of the ſons of men, as muſicall inſtruments of all ſorts.</hi> Here were the pleaſures of <hi>Solomon.</hi> But (verſ 11.) <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do, and behold all was vanity; and vexation of ſpirit, and there was no profit under the Sun.</hi> The wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> that had been trying every creature, whether it had any thing in it that might give him a true relliſh; profeſt, that there was <hi>no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit under the Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet further;
<note place="margin">1 Cor: 7: 19.</note> theſe pleaſures ſhall ceaſe, there ſhall be an end of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. <hi>The time is ſhort, it remaineth that thoſe that have wives, be as though they had none; they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not; they that uſe the world, as not abuſing of it; for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">Luke 8: 4.</note> our Saviour Chriſt, in <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14. ſheweth that the pleaſures of this life choak the word of God, that it cannot bring forth grateful fruit to God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4 Of riches.</note> if young men delight in riches, and rejoyce in their eſtates that God that given them: this likewiſe is a vain thing.</p>
               <p>For firſt, many times, wealth is gotten by deceit, and then God bloweth on it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.27.
<note place="margin">Jer: 5: 27.</note> 
                  <hi>As a cage is full of birds, ſo are their houſes full of deceit, therefore they are become great and waxen rich: ſhall not I viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord? and ſhall net my ſoul be avenged on ſuch people as this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ: 5: 12.</note> wealch is kept with much ſorrow, <hi>Eccleſ</hi> 5.12. <hi>The ſleep of the labouring man is ſweet, whether he eate little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,

<note place="margin">5 Of friends and Allies. Pſal: 62: 9.</note> If young men rejoyce in friends and Allies: this alſo is a vain thing.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.9. <hi>The man of low degree is vanity, and the man of high degree is a lie, to be laid in the ballance, they are lighter then vanity.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewed ſeveral things that young men rejoyce in, and have ſhewed likewiſe that their joy is founded upon vanity, upon nothing. And this is the ſecond means to heal young men of the inordinateneſs of their Joy, to meditate with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves how vain and frivolous all things are that they delight in.</p>
               <p>The third means is,
<note place="margin">3 Labour for ſpiritual joy. Rom: 5: 1.</note> to betake themſelves to ſeek ſpiritual joy. The well-head of this Joy is God: whom the Scripture calleth the <hi>God of couſolation.</hi> The inſtrument to convey this Joy, is Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being jnſtified by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> The grounds of this Joy are twofold.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">A twofold ground of ſpiritual joy.</note> the good things exhibited.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the good things promiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:47453:121"/>The good things exhibited;

               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 The good things promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> the other ground of ſpiritual joy, is the good things promiſed us. And thoſe may be reduced to two heads.</p>
               <p>God hath made promiſes, either in regard of evil things, (as we call them) of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions that befall us. Or the weakneſs of the graces that are in us.</p>
               <p>Now in the evil of Affliction, we may rejoyce firſt; In the promiſe of protection in affliction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the promiſe of Edification, by affliction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the promiſe of deliverence from affliction. All in the beſt ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Again, for the defects of grace in us; (which indeed is a thing exceeding grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to a true Chriſtian.) Here we may rejoyce. Firſt;</p>
               <p>In the promiſe of preſerving of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the promiſe of augmentation and growth in grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the promiſe of bringing the weakeſt grace to perfection.</p>
               <p>Here you have the well-head of Joy. Oh that young men would know God, and Chriſt Jeſus, and the word of God, and the promiſes, that they might leave this ſinful and ſottiſh joy whereto they are ſo adicted. This is the means to be rid of it, by getting into their ſouls, the ſence and feeling of the true Joy of the children of God.</p>
               <p>Again in the ſecond place;
<note place="margin">The ſecond Exhertation not to walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their own heart.</note> Young men ſhould be exhorted not to <hi>walk after their own heart:</hi> which is the next thing that <hi>Solomon</hi> noteth as a fault in them. <hi>The heart</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremy</hi>) <hi>is deceitful above meaſure, and deſperately wicked.</hi> It is ſo deceitful, ſuch a Cheator, that we are not able to comprehend it: it is <hi>deſperately wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> Who will follow a falſe guide? and a diſperate wicked guide? ſo is the heart of man.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">The third Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, not to walk after the ſight of their eyes.</note> they ſhould not <hi>walk after the ſight of their eyes. David</hi> prayed; <hi>Turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way mine eyes that I regard not vanity, and quicken me in thy Law.</hi> And again: <hi>Open mine eyes, that I may ſee the wondrous things of thy Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is much danger in following our eyes. <hi>Eve</hi> was miſled by her eye, ſhe looked upon the forbidden fruit, and ſaw it beautiful, and ſo luſted after it. And, <hi>when I ſaw</hi> (ſaith <hi>Achan) among the ſpoiles a goodly Babyloniſh garment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joſhu: 7: 21.</note> 
                  <hi>and a wedge of gold, then I coveted them, and took them. David was</hi> defiled by the eye:
<note place="margin">2 Sam: 11: 1.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſaw Bathſheba from the roofe of his houſe waſhing her ſelf,</hi> and then he luſted.</p>
               <p>Holy men have prayed to God that he would keep their eyes in a right frame and temper. Theſe are the particulars that <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth to young men in direction, to take heed of carnal joy: to take heed of walking after their hearts, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ſenſe. And theſe things (brethren) I have now committed in direction to you.</p>
               <p>The laſt uſe of this Doctrine is,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 3. To old men.</note> for old men. For if young men may not rejoyce carnally, much leſs may old men. Youth may plead for it ſelf, in want of wiſdome, and gravity, ſobriety, and experience, better then thoſe of age. If young men may not have evil hearts, and evil eyes, much leſs old men.</p>
               <p>Look to it, you that hear me this day, that are <hi>ſtricken in age,</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeaks) that are ſmitten in your limbs with age, that you cannot walk with activity and nimbleneſs: and are ſmitten in your ſenſes with age, that you cannot well ſee, and hear, and taſte. Oh that your hearts would ſmite you for your ſins. May not young men rejoyce in pleaſures, in friends, in honours, in wealth? Much leſs may thoſe of old age. Muſt young men be careful to chaſe away all carnal joy, and to get ſpiritual joy, that beginneth in godly ſorrow? much more muſt old men. It is no time for thoſe that are old to rejoyce in carnal things: a few daies will make an end of them, and lay them in the Grace. Oh then, you that are of years, <hi>break off your ſins by repentance, and your iniquities by mercy.</hi> Rejoyce in being good, and in doing good. This Joy will continue with you: as for the Joy of <hi>corn, and

               <p>In the ſecond place; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſheweth the remedy againſt this carnal Joy in young men: which alſo may be a preſervative againſt ſin, both for young and old. <hi>But know thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that for all theſe things God will bring thee to judgement.</hi> The Doctrine is thus much;<lb/>

               </p>
               <p>For opening of this point, I will briefly ſhew you theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what is the reaſon that God will bring all theſe things to Judgement.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what manner of Judgement it ſhall be.</p>
               <p>For the firſt.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe of Gods decree. Heb: 9: 27.</note> What is the reaſon that God will bring all theſe things to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The firſt reaſon is. His Decree, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed to all men once to die, and after this the Judgment.</hi> Even as it muſt needs be that man muſt die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath ſo appointed it: ſo alſo it muſt needs be that men muſt come to Judgement, in regard of the purpoſe and decree of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe of his righteouſneſs.</note> God will do this in regard of his righteouſneſs. He is a holy God, a hater of iniquity. But many times in this world it is well with the wicked, and ill with the godly. <hi>Lazarus</hi> he is in woful miſery, and <hi>Dives</hi> he is in abundance of proſperity: Now God will ſhew his love to the righteous, and his hatred to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Judgement. <hi>If judgement here begin at the houſe of God;</hi> It is impoſſible the family of Sathan ſhould eſcape hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe of clearing his wayes before all, men and Angels.</note> God will by this means clear his wayes, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. There are many wayes of God that are dark and cloudy to us, but then God will manifeſt himſelf before men and Angels. Then thoſe wayes and works of God againſt which the hearts of unſanctified men have boyled, ſhall appear to be as they are, holy, and good, and righteous, to their condemnation and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p>Yet further;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Becauſe of his hatred againſt ſin declared In particular judgements in this life.</note> The particular Judgement that God inflicts upon men in this life, may prove the univerſall. The burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gommorah:</hi> the drowning of the old World: the plaguing of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Theſe ſhew the inſinite hatred of God againſt ſin: therefore no doubt he will take a time to revenge himſelf of the impenitent amongſt the ſons of men, becauſe of their ſins</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Becauſe of the horrour that is in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> the conſciences of men may prove that there ſhall be a Judgement. For let a man commit ſecret ſins, that none knoweth but God and he, yet many times, he feeleth helliſh horrour: which is a manifeſt prooſe, that conſcience ſeeth, and apprehendeth God as the ſupream Judge, that will call all men to an account for their ſins. Thus you hear the reaſons why there muſt be a Judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:47453:122"/>The manner of this Judgment conſiſteth in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">The manner of the Judgement 1: It ſhall be the laſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> it ſhall be the <hi>laſt Judgment,</hi> after which there ſhall be no other: which declareth the terribleneſs of it. In this life, while there is life, there is hope: <hi>Let the wicked forſake his wayes, and turn to the Lord, he will be gracious to him.</hi> But then the ſentence ſhall not be reverſt: then there can be no appeal from that Judg, and judgment.</p>
               <p>Again it ſhall be a <hi>General Judgment,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2: It ſhall be a General judgement.</note> which is the ſecond thing. God judgeth in this world, and that both in life and in death: He judgeth in life, by chaſtiſing his children for their faults, and avenging himſelf upon his enemies. He judgeth every man at death. But then there ſhall be a General Judgment of all, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor: 5: 10.3: It ſhall be a manifeſt jndgement.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the third Place. It ſhall be a <hi>manifeſt Judgment.</hi> Sometime the Lord Judgeth men ſecretly, by raiſing up in them fears and horrours in their hearts: cauſing his curſe in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> as water in their bowels, and oyl in their bones. But then God ſhall open his wrath againſt the children of wrath, before a world of men, and no eye ſhall pitty them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4. It ſhall be a ſudden judgement.</note> it ſhall be a <hi>ſudden Judgment.</hi> Even as the flood came upon the old World, when they were ſporting themſelves, and deriding <hi>Noah</hi> that preached to them of the flood: ſo ſhall the fire come upon the World, that ſhall paſs before the face of Chriſt, when he ſhall judg the quick and the dead. <hi>As aſnare</hi> (ſaith Chriſt (<hi>ſhall it come upon all that dwell upon the earth.</hi> When the Fowler layeth a ſnare to take a Bird, he giveth not warning to the Bird, but ſurprizeth it ſuddenly; ſo will Chriſt Jeſus, ſurprize the ſons of men, ſuddenly beyond their expectation. The Evangeliſt faith, <hi>he ſhall come as a theef in the night.</hi> A theef knocks not, he giveth not warning: ſo Chriſt Jeſus, beyond the thoughts of men, will be on them ſuddenly before they are aware, by his dreadful Judgement.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">5 It ſhall be a righteous judgement. Rom: 2: 5.</note> it ſhall be a moſt <hi>righteous Judgment. Then God</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.) <hi>will render to every man according to his deeds.</hi> He will not regard the face of any: He will not be bribed by wealth or reward: He will not heare the teſtimony of the world for the wicked, or againſt the godly, but deal impartially, and give to every one according to his doings.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">6 It ſhall be an eternal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> It ſhall be an <hi>Eternal Judgment.</hi> So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2. The meaning is not, that God ſhall ſit for ever, ſifting matters, and ſurveying cauſes: but it is ſo called from the effect: for the concluſion ſhall be this, the Eternal weale and happineſs of the godly, and the eternal wo and miſery of the wicked, that ſhall be plunged by the juſtice of God into the ſevereſt torments.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this Doctrine.

When Sathan tempteth you to ſin, remember, God will call you to Judgement, even for thoſe faults, for which you may poſſibly eſcape the penalty of men, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is is impoſſible for you to avoid the righteous Judgment of God. If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than would have thee do any thing, that the word of God, and thy own conſcience ſheweth thee to be hateful, and wicked in the ſight of God: ſay to him, No, no, God will bring me to Judgment. This is the pollicy of our Adverſary, when he induceth us to evil, he makes ſin ſweet and pleaſant to us: but it ſhould be our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to make ſin bitter and loathſome, even in this meditation, <hi>God will bring us to Judgment</hi> for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Reſiſt the divel, and he will fly from you.</hi> But how muſt we reſiſt him; not by arguments of our own making, but by arguments of the word of God: and amongſt other weapons, remember to liſt up this: when Sathan would have thee ſin, ſay, No, no, <hi>God will bring me to Judgment.</hi> When the Divel ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited <hi>Eve,</hi> and circumvented her: ſhe ſpake (in the Serpent) to <hi>Sathan</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Judgment of God: <hi>We may eat</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>of all the trees of the Garden, but not of the tree in the middeſt of the Garden, leaſt we die:</hi> here ſhe brought an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnment from the judgment of God: but here was her weakneſs, ſhe preſently let it fall. It ſhould be otherwiſe with us, when Sathan tempts us: let us ſay, we ſhall die, <pb n="232" facs="tcp:47453:123"/>and be condemned for ſin: ſay ſo, and continue in it. If any revolt from the truth he profeſſeth, he ſhall die in his ſin. If any man diſquiet the people of God, by vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or oppreſſion, he ſhall die in his ſin. If any man be a drunkerd or Epicure, he ſhall die in his ſin. If any man be a whoremonger or adulterer, he ſhall die in his ſin: If any man be a ſwearer, God hath vowed, <hi>he will not hold him guiltleſs,</hi> he ſhall die in his ſin. If any man be an ignorant perſon, diſobeying godlineſs, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unrighteouſneſs, he ſhall die in his ſin. If any man continue in groſs wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in any wickedneſs without repentance, he ſhall die in his ſin, Oh remember this Judgement of God, this death that God will inſlict on ſinners for ſin: <hi>For the wages of ſin is death:</hi> and arm your ſelves with this when Satan tempteth you: if you forget Death and Judgement, you are naked, and unarmed, your ſpiritual Adverſary, may hit you on the bare, and ſpoil you as he will.</p>

The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he moveth the <hi>Atheniaus</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 17.31.) to repentance upon this very ground, <hi>becauſe God hath appointed a day, in which he will Judge the world in righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17: 31.</note> And ſurely if this will not awaken us, nothing will, nothing can. What do we mean (beloved) to ſuffer our ſins to ſtand upon the ſcore? Where is our wiſedome? Our grace? <hi>Are we able to ſtand before God, when he is angry with us?</hi> Why do we not take off our ſins by godly ſorrow? If a Judge ſhould ſay to a Malefactour, except thou mourn for thy offence thou ſhalt die, and be execnted. Doe we not think he would mourn to ſave his life? Behold, God faith to you, except you mourn for your iniquities, you ſhall die in your ſins. Oh why do not we make our eyes as fountains to bewayle our ſins? that man is poſſeſt with extream hardneſs that lamenteth not his iniquity, <hi>and he treaſureth up unto himſelf, wrath againſt the day of wrath, and the declaration of the righteous judgement of God</hi> Well, if we will not mourn for our ſins here to repentance, we ſhall mourn heareafter in helliſh horrour, without hope of help or mercy.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the Concluſion of all Fleſh; they were never ſo dear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but they come to be as loathſome and intollerable now. When once the lines and picture of Death is drawn over the Fabrick of Man or Womans body, (as it is ſaid here of <hi>Sarah</hi>) all their glory ceaſeth, all their good reſpect vaniſheth away, their beſt friends would be faineſt rid of them: even <hi>Sarah</hi> that was ſo goodly and amiable in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſight, muſt now out of his ſight, he muſt <hi>bury his dead out of his ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh the ſtrange miſery that ſin hath brought us to, when it devolveth, and throweth down all our glory at once: and the ruff of Man-kind in their chiefeſt pride, in their greateſt jollity, all is tumbled in an inſtant, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to baſeneſs, and ſtink, and miſery!</p>
               <p>How ſhould we be diligent to get the hope of a better life, ſeeing this is ſo little worth having? And how ſhould our thoughts alwaies flie up to God, ſince there is nothing but rottenneſs and putrifaction found here in the world?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:47453:124"/>But <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Father of faithful men, and a pattern to all loving Husbands in all ages inſuiug, doth not this till ſuch time as the dead <hi>Sarah</hi> groweth noyſome to all that look upon her. As long as he could by his mourning and lamentation proſecute her without offence to his eyes, and danger to his health, he did it, but now the time is come, when earth muſt be put to earth, and duſt muſt return to duſt. There is no place for the faireſt beauty above ground, when once God hath taken life and breath from it: it muſt go to its own elements, and to the rock and pit from whence it was hewen, thither it muſt return.</p>
               <p>This holy man therefore being well reſolved of this, and knowing the doom already uttered by God upon our firſt Parents, <hi>Duſt thouart, and to duſt thou ſhalt return;</hi> he cannot keep his dead longer by him; he knoweth the bed wherein now ſhe muſt be laid, therefore he ſeeks for it to theſe Country-men that he lived withall, that were Heathens and Pagans, but very moral and civil men, as we may ſee in this whole Diſcourſe. And he deſireth them that he might have a place for his own uſe and turn: not intimating ſo much to them, as that there ſhould be a ſeparation in their very death from Pagans and Heathens, but he keepeth that to himſelf, and covereth it with ſmooth ſpeech, and elegancy of language, as his manner was. For indeed it was not lawful for <hi>Abraham to bury his dead</hi> amongſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Heth,</hi> of whom he demanded this peculiar favour at this time: but God would have his children, as they differ in all their life from Heathens that knew no God, ſo they ſhould differ in every point, even in their Graves after death, that there might be no commixtion, and mingling of light and darkneſs, and no fellowſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and <hi>Belial.</hi> Therefore to continue this hope, and confirm it in all his Poſterity, that were a peculiar and choſen people; It was neceſſary he ſhould chuſe his Grave, his place of Sepulture, that they might be ſequeſtred from them in their death, as they were in the courſe of their life.</p>
               <p>Now after he had performed that duty that every man oweth to his dead friend, eſpecially to his Wife, the mate of his boſome; he cometh to move this to the ſons of <hi>Heth,</hi> that were Lords of the ſoil. He was abundant in tears before he comes to move it: for God which commandeth us not to lament for the Dead, as men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, doth notwithſtanding not forbid us to mourn, and ſorrow for them, and to lament: he giveth us leave; nay, he rather alloweth and approveth of natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when <hi>we weep with them that weep, and mourn with them that mourn, and rejoyce with them that rejoyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> knew well in what eſtate his Wife was, he knew ſhe was in a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he knew ſhe was the Mother of the Faithful, and was tranſlated to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paradiſe: and he was not angry with God for taking away his Wife, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained not the act of his providence; notwithſtanding he reſolveth into tears and laments. And theſe may well ſtand together, if they be not (as S. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious teares againſt God, and againſt hope, and againſt the faith of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: they are qualified and allowed, and accepted with the Lord, as a teſtimony of that good affection, and brotherly love that he commandeth to be in every one.</p>
               <p>After he had performed this, perhaps mourned three or four dayes for his wife, he knew this mourning muſt have an end, he knew that he muſt commit her to the ground, and make away with her, that ſhe might not be a means further to continue, and aggravate his ſorrow to no purpoſe: for with that condition a man is allowed the uſe of affections, as that he reſpects the glory of God, and give way to weak na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rather then to any indulgent affection that is too head-ſtrong and unruly, as though there were no hope in the promiſe of the Almighty. Therefore (I ſay) when he had thus moderated himſelf, as firſt to ſhew by his ſorrow that he was a loving husband, and then to ſhew in the ceaſing of his ſorrow that he was a wiſe man, and a faithful Chriſtian, he cometh now to the chief and main point, whereby to make an end of his ſorrow, and take away the cauſe of further grief, <hi>the ſight of his dead.</hi> He cometh to deſire a poſſeſſion of burial: and becauſe he was a ſtranger here, he cometh to thoſe that were Lords, chief ones, and deſireth them to intercede for him to the chief Lord, to bargain with him for a place that he had ſought out, and <pb n="235" facs="tcp:47453:124"/>as it ſeemeth (by Gods direction too) choſen. But I will go no further then the Text.</p>
               <p>Wherein firſt, conſider a certain preamble that the holy man uſeth to the people that he now converſt with, in theſe words; <hi>I am a ſtranger, and a ſojourner among you.</hi> Wherein the ſweetneſs of his nature doth ſhew it ſelf, that he was both hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-minded, to know and confeſs that he was a ſtranger, and alſo that he was full of reverence and reſpect to thoſe that he dwelt with: <hi>I am a ſtranger among you;</hi> You are the Lords, I a poor Tenant; You the Maſters of the ſoil, I but an In-mate, that came in and was firſt lodged by you, and with your conſent; and without your conſent I will not attempt any thing. That is the permonition whereby he inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth into their affections, and makes way for his ſpeech and petition, that after he was to propound and tender to them.</p>
               <p>And then the Petition followeth, <hi>Give me,</hi> becauſe I will not take it of my own head: <hi>Give me,</hi> What? <hi>A poſſeſſion,</hi> ſuch a thing as I may call my own, as I may have to my own uſe, ſequeſtred from all other mens: And <hi>Give it me;</hi> not upon gift meerly, but for my money, give it me for price: anſwer me what I ſhall pay, that I may acquire and make this purchaſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for what he would have this poſſeſſion: To bury his Wife, and himſelf, and his poſterity; A burying place for them. A ſtrange thing; a ſtrange pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for a man, to purchaſe no other ground, but to buy Land for a burying place.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whom he would bury there, <hi>my dead.</hi> He calleth her not his Wife, but his Dead; becauſe now the contract was ended by Death, and ſhe was no more his Wife, but one of his loving friends. Burial care after Death, it is committed to men by God, and by the voyce of Nature, therefore <hi>give me a place to bury my dead out of my ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It grieved him to ſee that beauty turned to pale black darkneſs, that now had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced the face of that beautiful woman: to ſee that ſweet compoſed body that was the mirrour of the times; and the miracle of woman in thoſe ages, that it was now ſubject to rottenneſs and putrefaction, and did now grow noiſome, that it made men flie from it, that they could not look upon it. <hi>That I may bury my dead out of my ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the branches of my Text.</p>
               <p>Firſt, concerning the humble preface that <hi>Abraham</hi> makes; <hi>I am a ſtranger and a ſojourner among you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A marvellous thing to conſider the great faith of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that he uſed in the apprehenſion of Gods promiſe: for all this land was <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> land, yet he confeſt himſelf a ſtranger: and Saint <hi>Steven</hi> ſaith in <hi>Acts 7. that he had not one foot of ground;</hi> not a foot in all the land that he could own.</p>
               <p>This is that wherein God is moſt glorious in his Saints, their expectation, their patient expectation of Gods promiſe: that they think themſelves as well for the time to come, for that which ſhall come, as if they were in preſent poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>When the Lord brought <hi>Abraham</hi> out of his native Country, out of <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> from the furtheſt part of <hi>Syria,</hi> he brought him many hundred miles to an unknown Land, and he promiſed to give him that Land, and to his ſeed after him: who would have thought but he meant to give him perſonal poſſeſſion? But no, as ſoon as he was there, the Lord drives him out by famine into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then he underſtood that Gods mind was not to give it him; but when the ſins of the <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> were ripe, and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were grown to a number, that they might come by ſome claime and right, and be ſuch a multitude as ſhould not be contemned, that they might not come by way of miracle to take poſſeſſion, then God purpoſed to give it him.</p>
               <p>So that this thing we may learn hence, that God is infinitely gracious to his children, when they are content with the appearance of things to come, aſ well as if they had preſent poſſeſſion. This is that which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> frequently ſpeaks of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. that the Fathers had regard to the promiſes, and truſted upon 
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47453:125"/>
God, that that ſhould be truly performed that was ſpoken to them, and therein they reſted themſelves, and were aſwell contented with the good word of God for the future times, for their poſterities, as if they had it performed in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am a Stranger and a Sojourner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are two words; the one, (<hi>A ſojourner,</hi>) ſignifieth, he that paſſeth by, as thoſe that come to ſee divers Countries and ſtay not, but are making homewards: the other, (<hi>A ſtranger,</hi>) ſignifieth, one that ſitteth by in a place. <hi>Abraham</hi> was both of them; for when God commanded him, he was ready at any time to diſlodge and go his way: as long as he found the mercy of God to him; that is, as long as there was peace, and plenty in the land, he reſted there in that place in his Calling. God appointed him to ſit there, and there he ſate, but not as heir of the ground, as a Lord, but as one that did ſit there by favour, as enjoying a piece of ground for his cattel to feed upon, (for the Land was not full, but they might afford ſome room to ſtrangers) ſuch was he, ready to flie when God called him. Therefore when God called him to <hi>Egypt,</hi> he preſently changed the place, and went to that: and from thence, when God called him again, he came to <hi>Mamre,</hi> and there he dwelt with the Inhabitants of the Land, becauſe he underſtood that that was the place that God had ſelected for him to make his poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>It teaches us to learn this voyce of our Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> as children learn to ſpeak by their Parents, and delight in their language; ſo we ſhould ſtill delight our ſelves in this language of the Eather of the faithful, to be, and account our ſelves <hi>ſtrangers and ſojourners among you</hi> that be the world, <hi>among you</hi> that have your cares ſo fixed on the world, that you have no care of heaven: <hi>among you</hi> that will give nothing, but hoard up riches, and you know not to whom you ſhall leave them: <hi>among you</hi> that have no dwelling above in that City, <hi>whoſe builder and maker is God: among you</hi> that live only on earth, <hi>I am a ſtranger among you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And being ſo (as every Chriſtian muſt profeſs himſelf) it therefore followeth, we muſt abſtain from all fleſhly luſts, and worldly deſires, and carnal concupiſcences, and appetites: for <hi>ſtrangers</hi> uſe not to ſettle on their dregs in the Country they paſſe thorow, but as men in motion, they take that which is needful, knowing that they have a Country in another place, the bleſſed <hi>Jeruſalem that is from above, who is the mother of us all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to conſider here the humble concluſion, that <hi>Abraham</hi> makes out of his pilgrimage, out of his ſtrangeneſs: becauſe he was a <hi>ſtranger;</hi> therefore he will be no meddler; as it is an old rule, ſtrangers muſt be no meddlers, they muſt not take what they will, not buy what they will, <hi>ſtrangers</hi> do not purchaſe land in a ſtrange Country, without the good will of the Natives. Such was the nature of this holy man of God, he would not ſo much as make bold with them for a bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place without their conſent. One would think it had been eaſie for him to have ventured upon this: whenſoever a man dies, the common cuſtome of nature, and the law of Nations yeeldeth this priviledge to put their dead into the ground, earth to earth: there is none ſo barbarous as to deny, by the light of nature, but that a dead man ſhould be buried, <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> or Forreiners, or native Inhabitants: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, a man would think that ſuch a man as <hi>Abraham,</hi> might ſafely have ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon this to bury <hi>Sarah,</hi> and never told them, and asked their good will. But no, the bleſſed man was of another mettal, of a heavenly and ſweet diſpoſition, he would trouble no man, he would give no offence, but carry himſelf as an Angel of God among them, harmleſs to every one, he deſireth every mans love, he was careful to avoid any mans diſpleaſure: and therefore he cometh to them as to great men, and intreateth them, as if it had been for a Lordſhip, or a piece of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or ſome great matter of eſtate: he cometh to beg a Grave, he deſireth a bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place.</p>
               <p>This ſhould teach us what ought to be our condition in this world, not to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious and bold, and preſumptuous, as commonly we are one upon another. And even <hi>ſtrangers</hi> themſelves, ſo forget themſelves now adayes, that they make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47453:125"/>
of depraving, and undermining, and ſpoyling, and putting Natives out of their poſſeſſion: they get to themſelves ſuch an impudency, as is ſtrange, and none of the leaſt reproaches, they neither approve themſelves to God nor men by this bold intruſion. Let <hi>ſtrangers</hi> be like themſelves, to know that nothing is theirs that they can challenge, they muſt come to it by the good will, and conſent of the parties, for <hi>strangers</hi> are not at home, but to be ſent home to their own place; they muſt preſume of nothing out of their place.</p>
               <p>If men did conſider this, they would not ſhoulder out, and in jure, and backbite one another, and all for baſe worldly pelſe, little better then a burying place, then a Rod of ground to make them a Grave: but men are ſo ſet on it, as though all their hope were here, as though they had no treaſure in another place, as though this were their home, and they had no further motion to better things. This is the Preface.</p>
               <p>Now the Petition followes. <hi>Give me I pray you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Give me,</hi> not <hi>Gratis,</hi> the meaning is not (as after the ſtory ſheweth) he would not take it for nothing, but give me for price, for reaſonable bargain, as you ſhall deem it fit to give me. Se here again the excellent moderation of this great man, this great ſervant of God: he confeſt it lay in their power to aſſigne and contract with him for any thing: it muſt be their gift, or elſe he would venture upon nothing: I have lived among you, and I would fain die among you too; as you have given me leave to live with you, I beſeech you caſt not away my dead: my Wife is gone the way of all fleſh, and I ſhal follow her ſhortly, caſt us not away: there is no further corporal living for us to gether; I beſeech you <hi>give me a burying place,</hi> and then we ſhall be one corporation, our bodies will moulder to nothing, and not hurt you; therefore <hi>give me,</hi> that which is a common gift, a gift that enemies will give to enemies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a gift to <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> and it is natural to do good to <hi>ſtrangers. I beſeech you give me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is this he would have? For though this people were very liberal, and would have given him a hundred times more then this he requeſted, as we ſee afterward by their anſwer: it would have been a great matter that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have been denyed: yet this holy man asketh ſuch a gift, as they might well grant without harm.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the holy man is to be commended; as for the great beggars of the world, they cry, <hi>Give, give;</hi> all the whole Country is not ſufficient to ſatisfie their deſire, but ſtill when they have had this, and that preferment, they cry ſtill, <hi>Give.</hi> This bleſſed man was of more moderation, he had a more circumciſed heart, and deſire: he deſireth no more then they might well forbear, and part with, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to have without hindrance.</p>
               <p>And ſo it teacheth men their duty, that they ſhould not too much grate upon a friend, not too impudently demand things that cannot well be parted with: many men are of ſuch good natures, that they will give away at the firſt ſight of a Petition, that that ſhall be a great loſs, and dammage to them, and after wiſh that they had not given it, when they cannot recover it again. There was no ſuch ſpirit in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> nor ſhould be in Gods children, they ſhould not be inſatiable, and extend themſelves to unreaſonable demands: a thing that argueth one altogether glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this world, and one that hath no further expectation than of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.<lb/>
                  <hi>Give me:</hi> What? <hi>A poſſeſſion of burial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>A Poſſeſſion.</hi> He would have it ſo conveyed, as no man might make claim of it, but that it ſhould be for him, and his for ever. Therefore it was, as it were, a Church-yard that he begged, ſuch a one as was capable, and had ſufficient ſcope and roome for his whole Poſterity in the time to come, in times of trouble and perſecution: for in this place were the Fathers and thoſe Partiarchs (though we read not of their Burial in this place in the book of God many of them, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is likely that all the Patriarchs had their bodies) conveyed to this place, and that the great ones in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that ſo demeaned themſelves, that they had <pb n="238" facs="tcp:47453:126"/>favour from the Court, were brought to this place. For theſe and himſelf, and his preſent Family about him, whom it might pleaſe God to ſtrike with Death he knew not how ſoon, the holy Father deſired a place ſeparare, that there might be no ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ſelect people of God with thoſe <hi>that were without God in the preſent world,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith.</p>
               <p>Now for this, there is no diſtinction in our time, for Chriſt being made the <hi>Corner ſtone,</hi> hath made both walls one, the Jewes and Gentiles being built upon himſelf, all this difference is taken away: But at that time it was fit to maintain a diſtinction, to keep a note of difference. As God ſet a mark upon the fleſh of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the houſes of the Iſraelites in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo they kept this in all points, even in their very Graves, that a difference might be maintained between the ſeed of the Woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent to the uttermoſt.<lb/>
                  <hi>Give me a poſſeſſion, a burying place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is the end why he would have this <hi>Peſſeſſion.</hi> A ſtrange kind of <hi>Poſſeſſion:</hi> a thing that every one is born to, no man will deny this: we ſay the land in the Church-yard is every mans, every man is born to that land. Behold ſuch a land, ſuch an inheritance this Father cometh to begg. He hath not a foot of ground in all the whole land, no place to dwell in, but by their leeves; no place to feed on but with there conſent; he is content thus to poſſeſſe, to have it upon their hand; to have his houſe upon their liking, and his field and graſs upon their affection, and content to be gone, and depart upon their bidding: but when it cometh that his dead muſt be buryed, there is no diſlodging then, no removing then, that is a <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> he makes not other things his <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> but uſeth them in a tranſitory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>So that the holy Ghoſt would teach us this, that a mans Grave is his ſtrong hold, his <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi> And indeed there is no <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> ſo durable and certain as the Grave: all the lands, and all the means that a man hath in this world, it may in the courſe of time, either by the miſguidence of the party, or the ſucceſſion of prodigals, be made away, that he that hath had full poſſeſſions, may not have a foot of land to call his own: ſo <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> are alterable, ſometime one mans, ſometimes anothers, and again anothers, no man knoweth whoſe, becauſe they are ſtill removing. But when a man is poſſeſt of his Grave, that is a long <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> that Leaſe is time out of mind, and it holdeth to the coming of Chriſt to Jndgement.</p>
               <p>Though there be a ſort of covetous men in the world, that care not for lucre and gain, to remove dead bodies, to make men pay dear; and yet preſently when the memory of that payment is gone (in this baſe reſpect) to remove them from their natural reſt, and to put new bodies in their room. Though this (I ſay) be practiſed by ſome, yet notwithſtanding the Lord hath ordered this that a man ſhould have his Grave for ever; and that all Chriſtian men ſhould know that they have no ſuch true inherent <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> ſticking to them, and they to it, as the Grave. Thus the great God bringeth us to life by death, making us poſſeſſe the Grave here for a time, and after poſſeſſeth us with life and glory, and joy in the higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.</p>
               <p>Behold <hi>Abraham:</hi> ſee how he beginneth to poſſeſſe the world, by no land, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, or earable Lordſhip: the firſt thing is a Grave. So every Chriſtian muſt make his reſolution. The firſt houſhold-ſtuff that ever <hi>Seleucus</hi> bought in <hi>Babylon,</hi> was a Sepulchre ſtone, a ſtone to lay upon him when he was dead; that he kept in his garden. So we ſhould begin to make that our chief utenſill: it ſhould teach every Chriſtian much more to be mortified ſo to the world, as to be ſettled upon nothing for a <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> ſo as the ground where his fleſh ſhall reſt in hope, till the Lord receive him, and give him his Spirit again.</p>
               <p>A ſtrong kind of entrance this holy man made into the holy Land, that the firſt thing he takes <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of, ſhould be a place of burial for the dead. Even ſo wond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly God uſeth to work: the promiſed ſeed, it came of the dead womb of <hi>Sarah:</hi> and accordingly it is in this great and famous Hiſtory, that out of theſe dead
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47453:126"/>
ones, the Lord takes ſuch a firme poſſeſſon of this Land, that when four hundred years were come about, there was ſuch a quick iſſue, that it drove all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants out of the Land: for out of <hi>Sarah</hi> that was now dead, and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Partiarchs that were interred in his Cave, out of their dead loynes the Lord raiſed a living iſſue of ſix hundred thouſand foot-men, beſides women and children that came under the conduct of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and diſcomfited the Captains of the Land and took poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>The gracious God out of dead and poor things in the world raiſeth ſtrength and Majeſty: that thoſe that they trampled upon, and accounted as dead men, the Lord made out of them ſuch a living ſtock, that all the poor of <hi>Canaun</hi> was not able to hold up, and make head againſt them, (they were ſuch a powerful Army) but hid themſelves in Caves, and became as dead men, to give place to theſe dead men.</p>
               <p>Here is the wonderful great glory of the Almighty, out of meer nothing, to work all things, and as he made all things that are ſeen out of nothing (<hi>for by faith we learn that things that are ſeen, were made of things that are not ſeen</hi>) ſo he ſtill continueth to lay his foundation in baſeneſs and humility, in a ridiculous manner to fleſh and bloud, yet out of that he bringeth large and infinitie majeſty and glory, ſuch as no man can aſpire in his thoughts to think ſufficiently of.<lb/>
                  <hi>Give me a burying place to bury my dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold, he calleth her <hi>Sarah, his dead,</hi> he calleth her not Wife, though it is ſaid after in the Text, that <hi>Abraham buried Sarah his wife;</hi> yet that is in reſpect of the time of her life, when they lived together, and in reſpect of the former ſociety, and converſe they had: but now he ſpeaks to the point, ſhe is no more his Wiſe, but his <hi>dead.</hi> It is tranſlated by all in the <hi>Neuter Gender,</hi> not my dead ſhe, but <hi>my dead,</hi> ſimply in the <hi>Neuter gender,</hi> as a thing which now had not ſo much relation.</p>
               <p>So it is true, when men and women are ſevered by Death, they are no more man and wife, but one anothers dead. For as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Do you not know that as long as a man liveth, his wife is ſubject to him, and ſhe muſt not couverſe with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> So likewiſe for men again: but when God diſſolveth the contract by Death, then as ſhe is free for another man, ſo ſhe is no more his Wife; ſo long as ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live upon the ground ſhe was his Wife, but now when ſhe is to go into the ground, he calleth her <hi>his dead,</hi> but not his Wife.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance and ſum is this; That Matrimony is Gods bleſſing for preſent uſe of mankind, for the propagating of the <hi>Species,</hi> to continue the ſeed of man to the worlds end, that there may be ſtill a generation to praiſe God their Creator; and ſo being a temporal thing ordained for the office of this life, it ceaſoth when Death cometh: there is nothing but Death, and that which Chriſt ſpeaks of in the Goſpel, can make a ſeparation: when death cometh all relations ceaſe, and a wife is no wife, and a husband is no husband.</p>
               <p>Behold out of this, the infinite love of God in Chriſt that hath made all things, all unions, and contracts, hath made all to be void but his own: for our Lord Jeſus in life and death is our Husband, our Lord, our Maſter, our Father, as well in the one as in the other: whereas by the intercourſe of death all things are diſſolved, two of the beſt friends that are may part upon diſcontent, and body and ſoul muſt part at Death, and Husband and wife (the Symbol of Chriſt and his Church) muſt part one from another: yet when all ſocieties and contracts part, Chriſt doth not part from us, but he is in the Grave, as well as in the higheſt heavens, our Husband, and Lord, and Spouſe, and we are his Church ſtill, we keep the ſame relation, and as ſtrong bonds in death, as in life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Dead.</hi>
                  <lb/>
Yet not withſtanding though ſhe was not <hi>Abrahams</hi> Wife, yet ſhe was <hi>Abrahams dead.</hi> This muſt teach a man after he is freed by Death to the combination and <pb n="240" facs="tcp:47453:127"/>contract, yet that there is a care remaining from the <hi>Dead,</hi> a love to that, though not as to a Wife: the reſpects of Man and Wife are carnal and fleſhly, Death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and cutteth down the fleſh, therefore cutteth off that reſpect too: but becauſe ſhe was <hi>dead,</hi> and there was ſuch bonds hetween them formerly, therefore a man is bound to lament and ſorrow for his <hi>dead,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> did here, to love the memory of the <hi>dead,</hi> to ſpeak well of the <hi>dead</hi> when occaſion ſerveth, to commend them for their vertues, to uſe the friends of the <hi>dead</hi> (as far as is in their power) with all courtiſie, to be good to the children of the <hi>Dead,</hi> thoſe that the mother hath left, and not to caſt them into the hands of a furious woman, a new Wife, that neither careth for dead nor living: but to have a ſpecial regard to the bonds and familiarity, and that ſpiritual acquaintance that God made in this life: and ſo to be good to all that come of that iſſue for their ſakes. <hi>Let me bury my dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly it followeth, why he would <hi>bury his dead. Out of my ſight.</hi>
                  <lb/>
A ſtrange thing, <hi>Out of my ſight.</hi> Was his grief ſo aggravated, as he could not ſtill behold her face? or was it neceſſary that the carkaſſe it ſelf muſt be conveyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? muſt it needs be that the body being now no way amiable, but noiſome, muſt be conveyed out of a mans ſight? The beſt friend in the world cannot endure the ſight of a <hi>dead</hi> body, it is a gaſtly <hi>ſight,</hi> eſpecially when it cometh to that diſſolution, that the parts begin to have an evil ſavour and ſmell, as all have when they are <hi>dead:</hi> then to keep themſelves in life and health, it is neceſſary to avoid them, to <hi>bury their dead out of their ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what ſo ſweet a <hi>ſight</hi> once to bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Sarah?</hi> What ſo ſweet a ſpectacle to the world as <hi>Sarah?</hi> The great Kings of the world, ſet her as a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi> and ſhe came no where but her beauty enamoured them: ſhe was a ſweet proſpect in all eyes, every man gazed on her with great content, to ſee the beauty of God, as in ſo many lines marked out in the face of <hi>Sarah.</hi> Yet now ſhe is odious, every eye that looked upon her before, now winks and cannot endure to look upon her, ſhe muſt be taken <hi>out of ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh bethink your ſelves of this, you that take pride in this frail fleſh, that prank up your ſelves, to make you graceful in every eye: you that ſtudy to pleaſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, you that are the great Minions of the world: you that when age beginneth to purle your faces, begin to redeem your ſelves with paintings: think of this. Mother <hi>Sarah</hi> the beautifulleſt woman in the world, is loathſome to her husband, her ſweeteſt friend: therefore I heſeech you in the fear of God, leave theſe fooleries, and vain fancies: remember what danger <hi>Sarahs</hi> beauty caſt her into; though it were a great gift of God, yet ſhe had better have been without it, then to have that hazard of ſoul and body, that ſhe was brought to by <hi>Abrahams</hi> travels and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: and know it that your beſt beauty is to pleaſe the eye of God, to look beautiful in his ſight: for the ſight of God is never weary; the ſight of men will be weary of you, the beſt friends you have will loath to ſee you dead, you will then be griſly in the eyes of men, but the eye of God it is all one even in the duſt, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make you ſo ill-favoured, but God will like you: therefore labour to pleaſe Gods eye that never ceaſeth: nothing will make him after his affection, whereas the eyes of men, this life is ſo full of foul alterations, as the leaſt ſickneſs bringeth an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination unto them.</p>
               <p>I ſee the time prevents me. I will ſpeak a little to the preſent occaſion. We have here a <hi>depoſitum,</hi> a gage, a pawn of a dear Siſter of ours, a woman known to you all to be of a holy Chriſtian converſation: a neighbour full of peace and quiet, and of good works according to her calling. She was alſo in the ſpiritual part a woman of a very good inclination, loving the Word of God, curious and attentive in the hearing of it; She was much delighted in it, and deſired to communicate the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ſhe had in the Scriptures to others, and to ſpeak of it as often as occaſion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. By this ſtudy it pleaſed the Lord to work a conſtant and lively faith in her, to put all her truſt and conſidence in him. She was now taken upon the ſudden, therefore the Lord hath left her as a pattern for us to look upon, to take heed to our <pb n="241" facs="tcp:47453:127"/>ſelves, that we may make our peace with God, and look for death every moment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know not how ſoon we may be arreſted.</p>
               <p>She was indeed a woman of great truſt and faith in God: and one whoſe mouth was full of his praiſe, ſtill admiring and recounting the wondrous grace of God to her in all the courſe of her life, in ſparing her, in giving her comfort in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, concerning the pardon and forgiveneſs of her ſins, and providing for her worldly helps, which ſhe thought never to attain to: and in many other particulars, She did open the grace of God according to her beſt underſtanding, ſtill giving the praiſe to his holy Name: and no doubt, if the ſtroke upon her had not been ſo fatal, and as deadly as now it was, we ſhould have had the like fruit more abundantly at this time. Howbeit ſhe was not as one altogether deſtitnte, but ſhe called for, and craved the prayers of Gods people, that they would lift up their hearts and hands, and voyces to the Lord to look upon her, and releaſe her of her miſery and trouble, either by life or death, for ſhe was content either way.</p>
               <p>She had ſome touches alſo of Divine Scripture as occaſion offered themſelves. As when the light was brought in, ſhe deſired to have the light of Gods countenance to ſhine upon her. And when her eye-ſtrings were broke, that the tears did diſtill down, ſhe deſired the Lord God to put her tears into his bottle, and many ſuch Luminations there were that came from her.</p>
               <p>Her ſurcharged ſpirits were ſo taken and ſtrucken, as a man might perceive at the firſt, there was no way but one; her ſelf drawing her ſelf within, as though that in the outward man there were no room for the ſoul to dwell there, or to have a fit and opportune habitation.</p>
               <p>I muſt needs advertiſe you of one thing, that this cnſtome of praiſing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending of the <hi>dead</hi> is very full of danger, becauſe a man may be a lyer, and a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before he be aware, when he never intended it. But truly (for ought that I could diſcerne) this Siſter of ours was one that was very well deſerving, of a quiet and moderate ſpirit, intentive and careful to govern her houſe and children, and no way exorbitant, for any thing that I can hear.</p>
               <p>It is true that all are not of one Model, as the bodies of men and women are not of one height and colour, ſo the ſouls and ſpirits are not all of one elevation neither: but we eſteem the children of God <hi>according to that they have received, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that that they have not received,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. I ſay therefore, <hi>according to the grace ſhe had received;</hi> I verily beleeve ſhe was faithful and true to it, <hi>that ſhe received not the grace of God in vain;</hi> ſhe ſought by all means to nouriſh and cheriſh it from one degree to another, and to proceed from <hi>grace to grace.</hi> And therefore I conclude in the judgement of Charity, that we have very ſtrong hopes, and great probabilities of her happy tranſlation.</p>
               <p>She was a Daughter of <hi>Sarah,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of Women, that he would have them demean themſelves, as Daughters of <hi>Sarah:</hi> and ſuch a one ſhe was in her habit and attire, in the manner of her life, and ſociety, and company: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I doubt not but ſhe inheriteth with <hi>Sarah</hi> the place of bleſſed manſions, that the Lord hath made infinite ſpecious, and wide, and capable for all bleſſed ſouls that put their truſt in him.</p>
               <p>Now, this let us make uſe of to our own ſouls. In that ſhe had not that large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time ſhe ſuppoſed to have had, but was ſurpriſed ſo ſoon and vehemently, as ſhe could not diſpoſe of her ſelf in that manner, as we know by experience ſhe would have done: it ſhould be a leſſon to us to be ready for God, to be acquainted with God.</p>
               <p>We have had two Corſes one after another, one a man, another a woman, both taken ſuddenly in reſpect of the time, though they had thought to have made an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of themſelves to the world, and thought to have made all things fair and eaſie, by the confeſſion and expreſſion of their faith to the world, but they were not ſuffered to do it. So, all preſume to have time to make the world know that they be humble and penitent, and to make their confeſſion; but many put it off till it be too late. Let us not be put off with vain preſumptions, <hi>the Lord giveth, and the Lrod takes,</hi> we know not how ſoon. We were born we know not when, we ſhall die we know not when. The Lord prepare us all for it.</p>

God writes a <hi>Ne perdas, Touch not,</hi> Deſtroy not, as a notable caveat, for the ſafety, as of Kings moſt particularly, ſo alſo of all that fear him, and that truſt in his mercy.</p>
               <p>I have haſtned over theſe points, that I might come to the teſtimony that I am to give to our deceaſed Brother, Maſter <hi>John Moulſon,</hi> which I may not omit, nor to be particular in it, having never ſuch a ſubject of diſcourſe before ſuch an exemplary man. I would not be bought to flatter a prophane and wicked great one, but here Gods glory in this his <hi>Servant,</hi> and the edification of you that are preſent, require of me that I ſpeak fully; for, he was <hi>Vir nec ſilendus, nec dicendus ſine cura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He copied out in his life the old way of Chriſtianity, and writ ſo fair after thoſe Primitives, that few now can imitate his hand. And truly as in a garden in which there are variety of flowers, we know not where to pick, ſo in thoſe many commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable parts of his, I know not which to chooſe to preſent unto you, or in what method. But you may take notice,</p>
               <p>I. Of <hi>his moral parts;</hi> where I commend four things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His Calmneſs and moderation of affection.</hi> No paſſion was obſerved to be a tyrant in him; they had an <hi>oequipoiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His ſober taciturnity,</hi> an imitable wiſdome in this age of talk and prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>His affable carriage,</hi> and eaſineſs of acceſs, by which like another <hi>Poplicola,</hi> he gained reputation, and the love of the neighbour-hood where ever he dwelt. Some are ſo <hi>hairy</hi> and <hi>rough</hi> like <hi>Eſau,</hi> that they may be diſcerned by their <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> and ſome ſo <hi>churliſh</hi> as <hi>Nabal, that a man cannot ſpeak unto them;</hi> Which ſourneſs and clowdineſs of ſpirit, I wiſh were not a blemiſh to many that give their names unto religion. He honoured it by his ſweetneſs and affalibility.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>His grave deportment and carriage.</hi> As nothing is more contemptible then a light youthly wanton old man, ſo the gray head, and wrinkled cheeks accompanied with ſage gravity commands reſpect from the beholders, as that old grave Biſhop <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> though he had loſt an eye, did from the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity dwelt in the face of this man, and his very preſence was ſuch, as would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance the rude and prophane.</p>
               <p>But all theſe are but mean commendations in reſpect of the next.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>His practice of holineſs;</hi> Where I will obſerve and commend unto you,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His unoffenſive youth,</hi> of which they that can remember him ſince that time, are confident to ſay of him, as the Emperour ſaid of <hi>Piſo; Hujus vita compoſita à pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritia;</hi> His life was compoſed, and ſettled, even from his very child-hood; and then began to ſort himſelf with the graveſt company, chieſly with that learned and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maſter, <hi>Chriſtopher Harvy,</hi> ſometime incombent in this Church, to whom he was dear. He was obſerved to be ſo ſober, and modeſt in his youth, that he was deſired to accompany, and attend an <hi>honourable Nobleman</hi> to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was very watchful, and careful of him, and prayed twice a-day with him in his chamber. So ready was he to <hi>bear the Lords yoak from his youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His unmarried eſtate,</hi> which was chaſt and modeſt. He lived above fifty years unmarried, and in that ſtate expreſſed two vertues, his wiſdome not to be raſh, and his care to <hi>keep his veſſel clean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>His married eſtate,</hi> &amp; courſe of houſ-keeping. 1. When it pleaſed God to diſpoſe his heart to marriage, he <hi>married in the Lord.</hi> 2. When God gave him Children, he <hi>nurtured them,</hi> and his Family <hi>in Gods fear.</hi> 1. He prayed four times a-day. 2. He read three chapters in the old Teſtament, and three in the New every day. 3. After dinner he called not for game for digeſtion, but read a Chapter before he roſe from table. 4. He catechiſed his children and ſervants conſtantly, according to ſome plain form. 5. He uſually roſe early on the Lords day, which time he gave to meditation and prayer, and what he could remember of the Sermon, he uſally repeated to his people.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:47453:131"/>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>His exemplary vertues</hi> in his whole courſe of life.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His meekneſs, and peaceableneſs of diſpoſition;</hi> A grace which in <hi>the ſight of God is much ſet by,</hi> and a notable teſtimony of inward holineſs, according as it runs, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. <hi>pure, then peaceable.</hi> He was not apt to quarrel in matters that concerned him not, never being obſerved to bear a part in any faction; a favourable interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of things not evident, readier to reconcile, then to make differences, and chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather to part with his right then with peace, as appeared in a <hi>ſuit</hi> known unto many here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Though he were meek in his own cauſe, yet he was <hi>zealous in Gods.</hi> He could not endure any thing repugnant to holy Scripture; nor would he neglect, either ſeaſonably to admoniſh, or reprove the faulty that were within the compaſs of his admonition, or to whet on, and <hi>exhort</hi> others <hi>to love and good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet his <hi>Zeal</hi> did not miſcarry, being <hi>allayed</hi> and <hi>tempered with wiſdome,</hi> as the heart is by the brain, and as the conceit is of the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> with the <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline heaven</hi> neer it. His wiſdome appeared, firſt, in <hi>his diſſcreetneſs,</hi> in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, and all affairs, an argument of which ſome take to be this; That he was never troubled, not ſo much as queſtioned in any Court concerning any fact. Second, in <hi>his obſerving a fit ſeaſon,</hi> when, and a fit <hi>decorum</hi> in ſpeaking. Third in <hi>his choyce of company,</hi> and ſpecially of ſuch acquaintance as he would be neer with and intimate, which were only ſuch as might be able to afford him ſpiritual aſſiſtance in a time of need.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>His freeneſs from worldlyneſs, and contentedneſs with his eſtate,</hi> not as thoſe in <hi>Horace, Quocunque modo rem;</hi> but he would not improve his eſtate by the raiſing it (as haply he might have done, and as others do) upon his tenants. He counted himſelf rich, becauſe he needed not all that he had, but could have lived with leſs; for, <hi>he that can make a little to be his meaſure, all elſe that he hath is his treaſure,</hi> which was the obſervation of a good <hi>Poet,</hi> but a better and a more mortified <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>His humility,</hi> and even among the very temptations to pride. It is an hard thing to be humble in an humble and low eſtate, but much more difficult in the affluence of outward things. You know his kindred and his relations, yet as he manifeſted this grace in his whole carriage, ſo in particular in not being puffed with his brothers and ſiſters greatneſs, or the advancement of his children.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>His diligence in the uſe of the means of grace;</hi> 1. <hi>He had a right conceit of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> moſt reliſhing, ſuch as were moſt wholeſome and uſeful for edification. 2. <hi>He took pains to hear.</hi> He was often known in his younger time, to go ten miles on foot, in thoſe times of greater ſcarcity. 3. <hi>His behaviour in the Church</hi> in the time of prayer, and in hearing, was very obſervable, for his reverend attendance and devotion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>His anſwerable practiſe,</hi> fitted and proportionable to his exterior profeſſion. 1. <hi>He was much in private prayer.</hi> If you would have a tryal of ſincerity, follow a man home, and to his cloſet, and ſee what he doth within doors; for there may be many reſpects that may ſet a man on work <hi>coram populo.</hi> Secret prayer if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, cannot lodg long with hypocriſie in the ſame heart. 2. <hi>He was often,</hi> as they ſay, <hi>in ſecret faſting by himſelf alone;</hi> a Duty not ouly lamentably neglected in theſe lazie times of eaſie Chriſtianity, but ill ſpoken of too, as a character of a <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> by ſuch as are loath to be at the pains of ſubduing their bodies, and yet are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to come off with the credit and reputation of religion. 3. <hi>He was temperate in his dyer,</hi> and in his habit ſober and grave, as counting wiſdome and grace, a better, and trimmer dreſs then Lace, or the faſhion; and ſo he was in his recreations, though conſtantly chearful, yet a man of little mirth or delight in any thing but ſpiritual. 4. <hi>He was full of charity,</hi> which appeared in theſe particulars. 1. Alwayes upon the Lords day he had ſix poor at dinner, to every one of which he gave a piece of beef away with them beſides, and at night he ſent what was left to other poor; Beſides what he gave at his door, and what he gave privately to the poor <hi>houſhold of faith.</hi> 2. His hoſpitality according to his rank, was ſuch as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> reported of <hi>Martin Bucer, whoſe table was ever open to any good people,</hi> eſpecially to Miniſters, <pb n="250" facs="tcp:47453:132"/>whom he much reſpected. 3. He ſate up many nights for the comfort of the ſick; not thinking that work of mercy ſufficiently performed by an <hi>How do you,</hi> or a cold viſit. 4. He had a Sympathy with the condition of Chriſts Church abroad.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the laſt place, let us view him in his laſt act, <hi>his ſickneſs and death, which</hi> as the Text hath told us, <hi>is pretious in the ſight of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He prepared himſelf to die, not only being <hi>willing,</hi> but <hi>deſirous alſo to be ſet at liberty,</hi> being often at S. <hi>Pauls, Cupio diſſolvi,</hi> which they that were with him, ſay, was much in his mouth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was very thankful for Gods aſſiſting him with memory and underſtanding to the very laſt, for the continuance of which he prayed, and deſired others that were about him to pray.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He employed both his memory and ſpeech, for the comfort and counſel of ſuch as viſited him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He made a confeſſion of his faith, but chiefly in the matter of <hi>Juſtification by faith</hi> (which an eminent <hi>Roman Prelate</hi> called a <hi>good ſupper doctrine</hi>) and in the comfort of that point, he reſigned his ſoul to Chriſt, and <hi>ſlept</hi> ſweetly <hi>in the Lord.</hi> Thus as his life was holy, his <hi>death</hi> was <hi>pretious.</hi> He made no great noyſe in the world, nor raiſed greater expectations of himſelf then he could well mannage, like many exhalations that riſe out of dunghils, as if they meant to reach the skie, but preſently fall down again, and wet us: But as a taper he gave light till he went out, and now he is gone we will leave upon his Grave, <hi>Memoria ejus in Benedictionibus,</hi> and apply to him the words of the Text; <hi>Pretioſa in oculis Jehovoe, pretious in the ſight of the Lord, is the death of his Saints.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I read theſe words, I am in a great doubt, whether I ſhould rather admire the excellency of the temper of theſe Saints, or deplore the vileneſs of ours; ſo celeſtial the one, ſo terreſtrial the other; ſo noble the one, ſo ignoble the other; ſo magnanimous the one, ſo abject the other. Theſe Saints they did duly conſider, that our life it is but a Pilgrimage: that this whole world is but a Diverſory, or Inn to refreſh us for a while; that it is a warfare, all things within us, without us, our enemies; that this body is but a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> a Tent, a Cottage, an <hi>carthen veſſel,</hi> a <hi>Gourd,</hi> the ſcabbard, the priſon of the ſoul; more brittle than glaſs, decaying, mouldering of it ſelf, though it be preſerved from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal injuries of air or weather: they ſaw the vanity, the vacuity, the emptineſs of <pb n="252" facs="tcp:47453:133"/>the things of this life; their affections were alienated, eſtranged, and divorced from the world; they had by watchings, faſtings, grovelings on the ground, tears and groans ſcoured off the droſſe of their ſouls, and made them poliſhed ſtatues of piety; they had made up their accounts between God and themſelves, and had ſued out their pardon for their defects and failings, and had that ſeated in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; they did penetrate the clouds with the eye of faith, and did ſee the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe good things laid up for them in heaven, with which being raviſhed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of cunctation and delay, they deſire to be veſted in the poſſeſſion of them, though it were with the depoſition of their <hi>honſe of clay,</hi> which they did bear about them. Of theſe things they had not a bareconjecture, but a certain knowledge; <hi>For we know,</hi> verſ. 1. <hi>that if our earthly houſe of this tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a building not made with hands, eternal in the beavens:</hi> from this full perſwaſion did ariſe this heavenly affection, <hi>in this we green earneſtly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alas, how different is our diſpoſition from this heavenly temper! how pale, how wan is our countenance at the mention of Death! at the leaſt ſummons of our laſt accounts! <hi>as vinegar to our teeth, as ſmoak to our eyes,</hi> as a ſudden damp to our lights, as an horrid crack of thunder in the middeſt of our jollities, ſo is the mention of Death. If any ask the reaſon of this, it is too manifeſt; Want of judgement, what is the true good of the ſons of men; Want of apprehenſion of the happineſs of the Saints; Want of faith in God, of Union with Chriſt; our ſouls never make any holy peregrination from the body, and ſeat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Angels and Archangels, and trace the ſtreets of <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> we anticipate not the joyes of the life to come by devout meditations and contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: we have not <hi>our converſation in heaven, from whence we look for our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: Our ſoul thirſteth not, our fleſh longeth not after the living God.</hi> The reaſon of this is, we hang upon the teats of the world like babes and children, we ſuck venome out of it to our ſouls; we walk upon our bellies as unclean beaſts, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, we jutt againſt God, and offend him; our accounts are not ſtreight and even, therefore we are afraid at the appearance of our Saviour, and of our citation to appear before his Tribunal; we groan when we hear of death, we groan not that we may die, this is our condition; and are not theſe different one unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother? Doth not this ſtain the verdure of our countenances, and cover us with ſhame and confuſion, to obſerve ſo manifeſt a declination of the fervor of the Spirit?

               </list>
               <p>That we are <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> do not the ſacred Oracles declare? <hi>our converſation, our polity is in beaven,</hi> faith the Doctor of the Gentiles, <hi>Our life it is hid up with Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2. <hi>We are fellow Citizens with the Saints, of the houſhold of God. Epheſ.</hi> 2. Doth not the chief of the Apoſtles intreat us <hi>as Pilgrims and ſtrangers, to abſtaine from fleſhly luſts, which fight againſt the ſoul?</hi> and do not theſe and the like demonſtrate unto us, that a Chriſtian lives with men, yet above men; in earth, yet in heaven; bound, yet free; detained with us, yet far above us; living a doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life; one manifeſt; the other <hi>Hid with Chriſt;</hi> one contemptible, the other glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; one natural, the other ſpiritual; that his Parentage is from heaven; that his <hi>Treaſure is in heaven;</hi> that his heart is in heaven, that his root is faſtened in the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting mountains,</hi> though his branches are here below, that his dwelling is in heaven; though his peregrination be here on earth, and did not theſe Oracles tell us thus much, yet are there not enforcing arguments to convince us of this Truth.</p>
               <p>Are not they <hi>ſtrangers</hi> that are out of their proper place? and are not Chriſtians <pb n="253" facs="tcp:47453:133"/>while they are here out of their place? Is this world made for Man, an Ark of travel, a School of vanity, a Laborinth of errour, a Grove full of thorns, a Meadow full of Scorpions; a flouriſhing garden without fruit, a fountain of miſery, a river of tears, a feigned fable, a deteſtable frenzy: and is this the place of man? What means the fabrick of our body lifted up to heaven, our hands, eyes, head upward, but to ſhew us, as <hi>Chalcidius</hi> the heathen man obſerved, that our Progenitors are from heaven, that our place is in heaven. Every place is adequate to the thing placed in it; is this world adequate to man? are not his deſires infinitely extended beyond the ſame? Every place hath a conſerving vertue in it: Doth this world Preſerve man? well may it miniſter a little food to this beaſt of ours, which we carry about us, but can it afford the leaſt ſavory morſell to the ſoul? it were to be wiſhed that it did not poyſon, contaminate, and deſile the ſoul: ſo that the ſafeſt way for the ſoul, is to flie from the world, as from the face of a Serpent: Is this world the place of man, why doth our tender Mother the Church, aſſoon as we come into the world, ſnatch us out of the world; and as aſſoon as we breath in the ayre, <hi>bury us by Baptiſm</hi> in the grave of Chriſt, and aſſoon as we move in this world, conſigne us with the <hi>ſign of the Croſs, to fight againſt the the world, and all the pomps</hi> of the ſame, and are not we <hi>ſtrangers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are not they <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> that have different lawes, and divers cuſtoms, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Prince to rule and command them? You have heard of the <hi>Prince of the ayre,</hi> and the <hi>Lawes of the fleſh;</hi> of the <hi>faſhions of the world,</hi> of the <hi>wiſdome that is from below,</hi> and earth-creeping: Are Chriſtians guided by theſe rules? have they not the God of heaven and earth, the <hi>Lawes</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>the wiſdome that is from above,</hi> and cuſtomes that are from heaven, whereby to regulate them? Who are the men of this world? are they not thoſe who have the <hi>God of this world</hi> to reign in their hearts? who are led captive by him? <hi>whoſe underſtandings are dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> their wills obfirmated, their hearts hardned, their conſciences ſeared, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation defiled with all uncleanneſſes, their ſenſes open breaches for ſin to enter; their tongues blaſpheming the name of God? and are theſe converſations fit for the Saints? and are they not <hi>ſtrangers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are not they <hi>ſtrangers</hi> that are not capable of honours, of poſſeſſions in the place wherein they live, as being not free Denizens of the place? and is not this proper to Chriſtians, whoſe duty it is to viliſie riches, and honours, and pleaſures in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as much as they that have theſe, do others that have them not? to account riches the greateſt poverty, and pleaſures the greateſt torments, and honours the greateſt ignominy, and power the greateſt weakneſs; not to <hi>poſſeſſe the world;</hi> not to enjoy it, not to account any thing good that maketh not the owner better, not to admit any thing from the world, but ſo far as it may advance the true Nobility of man, the purity of <hi>the Image of God,</hi> his reſtitution to his ancient deſcent, his re-eſtating him in the poſſeſſion of heaven, and the ſociety of Angels and Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to riſe up in Armes againſt this materiall world, and to rend himſelf from this <hi>faecaelent</hi> matter; and out of the greatneſs of his Spirit, and nobleneſs of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to be altogether ambitious of the preſence of God, and of theſe conſtant and unchangeable good things?

               <p>Are not they <hi>ſtrangers</hi> that have double Impoſt, and double cuſtomes, and the greateſt taxations laid upon them? is not this peculiar unto the Saints in this life? have they not afflictions laid upon them in the greateſt meaſure? muſt they not <hi>through many afflictions enter into the kingdome of heaven?</hi> Have they not <hi>tears,</hi> and that in abundance, <hi>for their meat, and for their drink?</hi> Have they not enemies from within, and enemies from without? Muſt they not be <hi>conformable</hi> to their head Chriſt, <hi>their elder brother:</hi> as he had his double portion in this life, of afflictions and puniſhments; ſo muſt they have; as he was ſanctified by afflictions, ſo muſt they alſo. The gold is not pure, unleſs it be tryed; nor the water ſweet, if it have not a currant; nor the veſſel bright, unleſs it be ſcoured; nor the Saints fit for heaven, unleſs they be prepared by afflictions: what man was there that ever ſet himſelf ſeriouſly, either to reform himſelf or others, that found <pb n="254" facs="tcp:47453:134"/>not great oppoſition from himſelf, and from others? and are not theſe <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers?</hi>

What ſhould I inſtance in particulars? are they not ſummed up to my hand by the Apoſtle? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. All theſe Patriarks, Prophets, Saints, all of them did acknowledg themſelves to be ſtrangers. Examples have in them an univerſality of Doctrine and inſtruction, eſpecially the examples of the Saints, becauſe <hi>Praxis Sanctorum,</hi> is <hi>Interpres pracceptorum,</hi> the practice of the Saints, is the beſt interpretation of the precept. Examples have in them a directive force, becauſe thoſe that are beſt diſpoſed in mind and body, are a rule for the reſt. Examples have an incentive force, to give life, ſpirits, vigour, tranſmitting by a kind of <hi>Metem Pſychoſis,</hi> the ſoul, the ſpirits, the reſolutions, the affections of the pattern, to him that reads it, extorting deep ſighs, and tears, and groans, and other alterations at their pleaſure. And if any Examples have this force, have not theſe much more? Other examples have the teſtimony of men, theſe have the teſtimony of God himſelf, <hi>he is not aſhamed;</hi> (a wonderful condiſcention of the one, and the ſupream elevation of the other) <hi>to be called their God, the God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and of Iſaac, and of Jacob; the Father of the faithful, and the God of the beleevers:</hi> There are examples whereof men boaſt, but God is aſhamed of them, corrupt examples of wicked; the imperfect examples of heathen men, of theſe God is aſhamed; but of theſe God is not ſhamed, and ſhall we be aſhamed of them?</p>
               <p>We are then <hi>ſtrangers.</hi> Let me inſtill into your ears, the voyce of that was heard in the Temple, before the ruin of it, <hi>Migremus hinc,</hi> Let us go from hence. Let me ſay unto you with our Saviour, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:47453:134"/>That the Saints deſire a true and proper houſe; <hi>In this we groan earneſtly,</hi> &amp;c. What is meant by this houſe, whether the <hi>Joyes of heaven,</hi> or a <hi>Gloriſied body</hi> is hard to determine by the context; I incline to <hi>Calvins</hi> opinion, that both are meant, as making up that compleat houſe which the Saints deſire, the one as the introition, the other as the conſummation of their bliſs; and into both theſe houſes, I ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to introduce your ſpirits and affections.</p>
               <p>The firſt houſe is the <hi>Joyes of heaven,</hi> a kingdome elſe-where; for the amplitude, for the abundant ſufficiency, for the honour, royalty of them; yet becauſe many in kingdomes ſee not the face of the King, and of thoſe that ſee his face, few are of his houſe and family; and of thoſe that are of his Court, few are familiar with him, or converſe with him; and of thoſe that converſe with him, few are his ſons, his heirs. Therefore this kingdome is an houſe wherein all ſee the face of God; all are of his houſe, all converſe with him, all ſtand in his preſence, all are his ſons, all are his heirs; a houſe ſo ſcituated, as never any; upon the brow of that hill, which is the <hi>beauty of perfection,</hi> the <hi>delight,</hi> not <hi>of the whole earth,</hi> but of heaven it ſelf, in the pureſt ayre that ever was, even purity it ſelf, free from all malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vapour; a place irriguous with the chryſtal ſtreams of Paradiſe it ſelf, a place inriched with all the precious things the heart of man can deſire; an houſe not built by man, but by God himſelf; not of terreſtrial feculent matter, not of gold or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but that which excells all valuation whatſoever; the hanging or or naments of which houſe, are not of Arras, or Tiſſue, or cloth of Gold, or whatſoever is more precious with men, but far above theſe, ſuch and ſo excellent, that <hi>Neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard; neither hath the like entered into the hearts of men.</hi> The delights of this houſe are ſuch, that if all the contentments and delights that ever raviſhed the hearts of men in their private houſes were put together, yet were they but as a candle to the Sun, as a drop to the Ocean: Oh the ſtatelineſs and magnificence of the Hall of this houſe, wherein are Prophets, Apoſtles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Confeſſors, Saints, Angels, the bleſſed Virgin eſpecially, all of them prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and lauding God! <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in this houſe, they will be ſtill prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thee.</hi> Here in this life are variety of imployments according to the diverſity of mens Callings, and their neceſſities; but there ſhall be no neceſſity, there ſhall be but one work, the work of <hi>Praiſe,</hi> a duty which in this life is performed with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation and wearineſs; but their it ſhall be done with all ſweetneſs and delight, increaſing with the continuance of the ſame. No vain thoughts, to interrupt this duty, no wearineſs of the fleſh to weaken this duty, no neceſſity or indigency to rend us from this duty; but as it will be our happineſs to love, and ſee God, ſo it will be the exerciſe of our happineſs to admire, and to laud God: while we are here, ſuch is the weakneſs of our apprehenſion, that we cannot with the ſame act conceive the work, and the workman; we cannot think of the benefit, and the author of the ſame, then we ſhall be enabled to joyn both theſe together, ſo to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the work, as at the ſame time to praiſe the author; ſo to contemplate the benefit, as at the ſame time to fall down before the benefactor. Oh the ſtatelineſs of this preſence, where the face of God, the beauty of God, the Majeſty of God is ſeen in ſo glorious a manner, that even Angels, and Archangels <hi>cover their faces,</hi> not being able to behold ſtedfaſtly the great luſtre of the ſame! Oh the lovelineſs of the <hi>chambers of the King,</hi> made for the ſoul to repoſe her ſelf in all ſpiritual delight, after her labour and travel in this miſerable world! oh the beauty of the <hi>Manſions</hi> of this <hi>houſe</hi> prepared by Chriſt himſelf for the ſoul, to refreſh her ſelf with all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual food! and oh the variety and excellency of the food of this <hi>houſe,</hi> the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall have his food, morning and evening knowledg; a clear view of all things, not in themſelves, or in their cauſes, but in their exact <hi>Idea's,</hi> ſubſiſting in the eſſence of God, but eſpecially the radiant viſion of the face of God, the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, the Sun of righteouſneſs. The will ſhall have her food, goodneſs, joy, delectation, not by meaſure, but drowned in the full ocean of theſe, with that ſtability and confirmation that ſhe cannot will that which is evil; The affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens ſhall have their food, being fully ſatisfied beyond their deſires. The Body ſhall have his food, being made an impaſſible, clarified, Agil, ſpiritual body, defecated, <pb n="256" facs="tcp:47453:135"/>and purified from this feculent elementary food, and all other alterations common to it with beaſts: and which is moſt wonderful, the King of Kings ſhall gird himſelf to reach out theſe Joyes unto us; they ſhall be adminiſtred unto us <hi>Ve jad Hamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek,</hi> by the hand, by the power of a King; Did I ſay this of my ſelf, who would give credence unto me? but Truth faith it, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.37. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants whom he ſhall find watching; verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall gird him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and make them ſit down to meat, and will come forth and ſerve them.</hi> Oh wonderful dignation! who ever heatd of the like? <hi>Stat Cato dum Lixa bibit,</hi> the Lord ſtands, the ſervant ſits; the Lord is girt, the ſervant is looſed; the Maſter is reaching out full bowels, and the ſervant is inebriated with the rivers of theſe pleaſures; once he girt himſelf to waſh his Diſciples feet, and the ſervant was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed to ſee ſo great a Majeſtie condeſcending to ſo mean miniſtery; ſhall we not be much more raviſhed with this ineffable dignation, when he ſhall again gird himſelf to ſupply the ſoul with unſpeakeable delight, as if God himſelf intended nothing in heaven, but to heap content upon them that <hi>ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;</hi> This is the <hi>fatneſs,</hi> the excellency of this <hi>houſe;</hi> with the weak adumbration whereof, I doubt not but that your hearts are ſo taken, that ye have reduced all your deſires to this one, with the Pſalmiſt; <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord, which I will deſire, even that I may dwell in his houſe, and behold the beauty of the Lord.</hi> And I wonder not when I contemplate the Mafeſty of God, I wiſh my ſelf all fear; and when I conſider the power of God, I wiſh my ſelf all humility; and when I meditate on the goodneſs of God, I wiſh my ſelf all Love; and when I contemplate the Beauty of God and of this bouſe, I wiſh my ſelf all deſire, and ſo do you alſo: and therefore with unanimous votes you requeſt me to conduct you to the gates of this <hi>houſe,</hi> whereby you may enter into the ſame, and according to the magnificence of this Houſe, ſo there are many gates whereby we may enter; and all of theſe <hi>reaching</hi> even <hi>to the Earth</hi> with the foot of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder.</p>
               <p>There is the gate of <hi>Faith,</hi> by it we have <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>acceſs unto God,</hi> and that <hi>with boldneſs;</hi> by this we lay hold on the <hi>Throne of Grace;</hi> by <hi>this</hi> we proſtrate our ſelves at his feet; by <hi>this</hi> we adhaere, and cleave cloſe unto God; by <hi>this we live in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt in us;</hi> by <hi>this</hi> our hearts are purified, our <hi>conſcience waſhed with the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> and fitted to ſee God, and to enter into the <hi>holy of holies,</hi> unto which no unclean thing can be admitted. This is one Gate.</p>
               <p>Another is the gate of <hi>Hope,</hi> which <hi>entreth within the Vail,</hi> and bringeth us neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto God; <hi>this</hi> grace taketh us by the hand, and leadeth us through the ſtreets of <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſheweth us the <hi>Temple of the Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> ſitting in his Temple, aſſuring us that we ſhall live there with him; <hi>this</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, heaven before heaven, the life of the Soul, the keeper of Chriſt, the keeper of God: This is a ſecond Gate.</p>
               <p>There is another gate, the gate of <hi>Charity;</hi> by this we enter not, but preſs in unto God, and are not led, but tranſported unto God, and carried in a <hi>fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot.</hi> By this grace we approach not neer unto God, but forgeting the greatneſs of his Majeſty, we lay hold on him, we hang upon him, we imbrace him, we fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly converſe with him; we freely conſult with him, we inſeparably cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him more cloſe then any <hi>Polypus</hi> doth unto the Rock.</p>
               <p>Another gate, is the gate of <hi>humility,</hi> a low gate, but a ſure and certain gate, the exaltation of the ſoul, the honour, the dignity of the ſoul, that which ſubjects the ſoul immediately to God, and ſo ſeateth it above all the creatures; that gate whereby the ſoul ſteals into heaven, though the gate be never ſo ſtreight, by crouching, bowing, bending, pinching of it ſelf. At theſe gates, if you knock earneſtly by devout prayer, and frequent Almes, you may enter into this glorious and magnificent <hi>houſe,</hi> with which the Saints <hi>deſire to be cloathed upon:</hi> and this is the firſt <hi>houſe</hi> which they deſire.</p>
               <p>There is another <hi>houſe</hi> which the Saints deſire, and that is the <hi>houſe of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> glorified: while they are here in this life, they have a cottage rather than a houſe, a cottage ſeated in a low watery myriſh place, expoſing the ſoul to Agues, <pb n="257" facs="tcp:47453:135"/>Feavers, and variety of diſeaſes, ſo that ſhe is ſometimes down; at the beſt but craſie and valetudinary: ſcarſe any viciſſitude and change, either of age, or place, or calling; but the ſoul is dangerouſly affected with it, and in great hazard; a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Cottage, ready to fall upon the ſoul, and craſh it in pieces; a cottage full of holes and rifts, in every ſtorm, and tempeſt of adverſity it rains through this cottage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul, and makes the ſoul unhealthy; in the Sun-ſhine of proſperity, the beams of the Sun beat upon the ſoul, and make it faint and weak, many times a ruinous cottage, ſo that the inhabitant is forced to ſpend almoſt all his time in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing it, in keeping it up, in ſupplying the neceſſities of it; diſtracted, rent, and torn with cares and ſollicitudes for it, ſo that little time is left for better du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for duties proper to the inner man, and when the ſoul ſetteth her ſelf to theſe duties, then this Cottage is an impediment unto her, taking off her mind from it by ſome ſudden guſt of a vain thought, or hindring her by ſome indiſpoſition, or compelling her by ſome urgent neceſſity, to break off before ſhee is willing. Theſe and the like incumbrances do much afflict the Saints, therefore they <hi>deſire to be cloathed upon,</hi> with a pure <hi>houſe,</hi> a pleaſant <hi>houſe,</hi> a lightſome <hi>houſe,</hi> a healthful <hi>houſe,</hi> a durable <hi>houſe,</hi> a glorious <hi>houſe,</hi> that might be a help and incouragement to the ſoul in holy and religious duties. <hi>In this we groan earneſtly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You that are owners of the wonder, are not ignorant what a wonder man is, a compoſure of different natures, Celeſtial, terreſtrial, Angellical, beaſtial, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, ſpiritual; greater then the world, leſs then the world; the richeſt Pearle, and the baſeſt foyl; <hi>the Image of GOD,</hi> and a peece of clay: you are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how theſe two are affected one to the other in the Regenerate man, if the body be ſound and well, it kicketh againſt the ſpirit; if it be ill, it afflicts the Spirit, How do I love my body, as my fellow ſervant, and eſchew it as a mine enemie? how do I hate it as my clogg, and reverence it as my fellow-heir? I buffet it as a ſlave, and imbrace it as a friend; I chaſtiſe it and keep it under, and then I want a companion to aſſiſt me in the works of piety; I cheriſh it, and nouriſh it, and then am I ſtung with the luſts of it; it is a flattering enemy, a treacherous friend. Oh my conjunction; and oh my alienation! that which I fear I imbrace, and that which I love I fear: before I make war with it, I am reconciled; and before I am reconciled, I am at variance: what a ſtrange myſtery is this! therefore the Saints mortifie and crucifie their bodies, they gird them cloſe with the cords of ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, they macerate them with watchings and faſtings, and make them thin, and pale, and wan, that ſo they may be ſerviceable to the Spirit; they labour that their hands may be tranſlucent with faſting, as the hands of <hi>Elphogus</hi> were, that their countenances may be living documents of humility, that their bodies may be as tranſparent glaſſes, wherein the thoughts of their hearts may be ſeen, that their ſoules may have no more reſidence in the heart, but may as evidently be ſeen in every part of the body as there. This they aym at, and when they have done all this, yet they complain of the dulneſs, deadneſs, heavineſs, lumpiſhneſs of the body, and are at enmity with it, and cry out, <hi>Oh miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> not that they are ſimply enemies to the body, but to this earthly corruptible body, this ſinful body that depreſſeth the mind muſing of many things, and deſire the depoſition, and laying down of the ſame, that ſo they may receive a glorified, a clarified, an incorruptible ſpiritual body, not made of a ſpirit, but ſerviceable to the ſpirit; they deſire that theſe eyes may be ſo defecated, that if they cannot behold the eſſence of God, yet they may ſtedfaſtly behold the <hi>Empirian heavens,</hi> the ſplendour of our Saviour, and the luſtre of the bodies of the Saints, more bright then the Sun ſeven times; they deſire that theſe hands may be bleſſed with the contractation of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred body that redeemed them, they deſire that this body may be ſo tranſparent and lucid, that the ſoul may ſally bout freely, not at the eye alone, but at every part to contemplate thoſe glorious objects, that it may be ſo prelucit, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts of the heart, and the divine fancies that are in the imaginative part may be ſeen through it, that it may be ſo ſtript of corporal denſity and groſſeneſs, that like lightning it may be here and there, that it may be fit for raptures, and extraſies, 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47453:136"/>
and the Soul no more doubtful whether ſhe be in the body, or not in the body; This the Saints deſire and long after. And let me ſpeak this of you oh triumphant Souls that are now in bliſs without the leaſt impeachment of your happineſs. This even you thirſt after, you eſteem it an imperfect eſtate to be without your bodies, though you glorifie and praiſe GOD in your ſouls, yet you count it an imperfect work, and ſay with the Pſalmiſt; <hi>In death no man remembreth thee, and in the grave no man ſhall give thee thanks,</hi> though your ſpirits do it without ceaſing, without failing, yet the whole man doth it not; and ſuch an inſatiable avidity, there is in you of the praiſe of God, that unleſs it be done totally and fully, you think it not done at all, therefore you deſire this glorified Organ; but the Saints on earth being much more depreſſed with this heavy clay, cry out with theſe Saints; <hi>In this we groan earneſtly,</hi> &amp;c.<lb/>
                  <hi>To be cloathed upon with our houſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>An impropriety of ſpeech I confeſs, for men do not cloath themſelves with hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet of eminent elegancy and pregnant, with variety of inſtructions: to ſhew the fitneſs of this glory to every ſoul, as apparel is fitted to every body: to ſhew the comlineſs of this glory; as apparel is an ornament to a man: to ſhew the firm adheſion of this glory, the whole man as a garment doth cleave cloſe unto him: to ſhew the redundancy of this glory, that a man ſhall invelopp himſelf in this glory, as a man doth inwrap himſelf in his garment: to ſhew the Author of this glory, he that made garments to cover mans nakedneſs in Paradiſe below, he maketh robes of honour to adorn him everlaſtingly in Paradice, which is above: to ſhew the undeſervedneſs of it on our part, that theſe garments they are not webbs of our own ſpinning, but robes of Gods giving: to ſhew the all-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this glory, in this life we need houſes to dwell in, and rayment to cover us, and food to nouriſh us, and fire to warm us; but this glory it ſhall be a Magazine of all ſpiritual ſtore, an houſe to ſhelter us, a garment to cover us, Manna to feed us, water to refreſh us, it ſhall be all in all unto us. Theſe and many more inſtructions are folded up in the Cabinet of this Metaphor, which ſtreights of time will not give me leave to unfold, and ſpread before you, but muſt leave them to your private me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations; and ſo paſſing (though unwillingly) from theſe <hi>two houſes</hi> which the Saints deſire; I muſt raiſe up your attention to their ardent affection unto them. <hi>In this we groan earneſtly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Wherein you ſee the intention of their affection, and the expreſſion of it; The intention not <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Deſiring earneſtly; The expreſſion of it by groans; <hi>In this we groan earneſtly.</hi> The one the ſoul, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the body; the one the form, the other the exerciſe; the one the root, the other the branch; or if you will, the one the fire, the other the fuel; the one the flame, the other the oyl that nouriſheth the flame.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the intention of the affection. As thoſe that are in a longing paſſion die if they be not ſatisfied: as the pregnant Mother groans to be delivered of her burthen; as thoſe that are preſſed under a heavy weight, faint if they be not eaſed; even ſo the Saints preſſed down with that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that <hi>eternal weight of glory,</hi> mentioned in the precedent Chapter, a burthen which did both preſs them down, and raiſe them up; that did both ſtraiten them and enlarge them; like the feathers of the Dove, which add to her Maſs, but take off from her gravity, which makes her more corpulent, and yet more light; even ſo this weight of glory ſo preſſed down the Saints, that it raiſed them up to the Throne of the Lamb, and feeling this <hi>body of ſin,</hi> this <hi>body of death,</hi> which they did bear about them as plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets of lead hanging at their feet; they deſire eſt-ſoon to be ſtripped of all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances and impediments, to depoſe and lay down this cottage of clay, that ſo <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent from the body, they might be preſent with the Lord;</hi> this was the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their affection. <hi>In this we groan earneſtly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>An affection, worthy the name of an affection, truly grounded, and therefore towring ſo high, that it is almoſt inviſible to our weak ſight. There are ſome in <pb n="259" facs="tcp:47453:136"/>this life that are fed with gall and wormwood, with tears and groans; upon whom the wheel of oppreſſion is roled, breaking all their bones, ſo that they ſeek for death, as for pearls and hidden treaſures, as an end and period of their miſeries. Others there are who ſeeing the vanity of the things of this life, and ballancing with them the trancendent excellency of the Soul of man above the world, had rather be idle, or not be at all, then to be ſo baſely and meanly imploved, and rewarded, as the world doth remunerate her favourites. Others make bitter invectives againſt the body, as the only impediment to the ſoul in her more pure ſpeculations, placing the happineſs of the ſoul, in the ſeparation from the body; all theſe come far ſhort of this divine affection, which hath not her riſe from the miſeries of this life, or from the vanity of the creature, or from the incombrances of this cottage, but from a true apprehenſion of the love of God, from a deep panting after union with him, from a taſte of the powers of the life to come, from a Soul inflamed with a coal from Gods Alter. Look upon theſe Saints in my Text, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed exerciſed beyond meaſure, with thoſe things which we call miſeries, calamities, afflictons; at the mention whereof we quake like Aſpen leaves; but were theſe tainted with impatiency? were theſe groans fuliginous vapours from a maleconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpirit? Did they not account theſe afflictions their Juſts and Barriers, and Turnaments, and exerciſes of honour and Chivalry, at which Angels, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels were preſent with their <hi>Euges</hi> and approbations, God himſelf the chief Spectator, and rewarder of theſe exerciſes, they themſelves triumphing and boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their tryals, with the impreſs of the Apoſtle on their ſhields of faith; <hi>We are perſwaded, that neither death nor life, nor Augels, nor Principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent; nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> They were more Eagle-eyed by the ſtrength of grace, to pry into the nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the creature, then all the Philoſophers by the ſtrength of nature; they did mortifie, and crucifie, and keep under the body, with the luſts thereof, and more truly deteſt the corruption of the outward man, then any <hi>Platoniſt</hi> whatſoever: but were theſe the grounds, the riſe of this celeſtial affection? nothing leſs, to ſee God, to enjoy God, to dwell with him, to converſe with him, to <hi>be diſſolved, to be with Chriſt:</hi> theſe tranſported their affections; not the emptineſs of the things below, but fulneſs of things above; not the baſeneſs of earthly things, but the glory of celeſtial things; not the miſeries of this life, or of this crazie veſſel, but the happineſs of the life to come; they had but a glimpſe of this ſtrange light darted into ther ſouls, and the whole world was darkneſs unto it; they had a guſt of ſweetneſs caſt into the palate of their ſouls, and all things elſe were bitter and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory: Chriſt was placed in the ſummity and height of their ſouls, and the deſire of the full fruition of him cauſed that fainting, that earneſt longing in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>You will ſay if this be ſo, what will become of the greateſt part of Chriſtians, who are afraid to die? who are ſo far from <hi>groaning</hi> to depoſe this <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> that they groan at the leaſt intimation of diſſolution? It is true that all men receive not this ſaying, neither is it for every one to attain to this perfection. As there are two forts of faith, ſo there are two forts of Chriſtians; there is a ſtrong faith, and a weak faith; and there are ſtrong Chriſtians, and there are weak Chriſtians; the ſtrong Chriſtian is willing to die, and patient to live; the weak Chriſtian is willing to live, and patient to die; he goes when God calls, but he could wiſh that God would defer his calling; he hath good hopes of heaven, but he deſires a little more to enjoy the earth; he loves God more then all, yet his affections are not fully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from all; he is not perplexed with the fears of Hell, yet he is not raviſhed with the joyes of Heaven; he hath much ſtrength but knows it not: as many a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a prize, is better able to performe it, then he that undertakes it; but either through faintneſs of heart, or ignorance of his own ſtrength, dare not put it to the hazard, but had rather commend another mans valour, then trie his own; whereas a ſtrong Chriſtian, a man grown in Chriſt, ſends a challenge to this Gyant Death, ſingles him out, as a fit object of his valour, grapples with him, not as with his <pb n="260" facs="tcp:47453:137"/>match, but as his underling, inſulteth over him, ſetteth his foot on the neck of this <hi>King of terrours,</hi> and by conquering him, captivates with great facility all other petty fears of ignominy; poverty and the like, which therefore are dreadful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tend to Death, the laſt, the worſt, the end, the ſum of all feared evills: this is the unconquerable crown of Faith; this is the glory of a Chriſtian, this is the Diadem of honour wreathed about his Temples, advancing him above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men whatſover.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, may a man deſire death! Is this now a queſtion, what means the agony of the Apoſtle? <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> What means the earneſt longing of the Spouſe? <hi>Apoca. 22. The Spirit faith come, and the Bride faith come; and let him that hears ſay come.</hi> What means her fainting in the Canticles? <hi>I am ſick of love, let him bring me into his chamber: Let me ſee his face, I am ſick unto death: Let me dy leſt I dy, that I may ſee him for ever.</hi> What means the Character of a true Chriſtian: <hi>As many as love the appearance of the Lord,</hi> which cannot be without death: What means the incredible contempt of death in ancient Chriſtians, inſomuch, that it was a received Maxime with the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; <hi>Omnis Chriſtianus eſt contemptor mortis.</hi> What means the heroical incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of old <hi>Hilarion, Egredere anima, egredere, quid times? Go out my ſoul, go out, why trembleſt thou?</hi> What means the words of old <hi>Simion</hi> in the flames; <hi>Thus to dy is to live?</hi> What means the rapture of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that he would thank that man that would kill him, as tranſmitting him more ſpeedily to thoſe unconceivable Joyes? What means this <hi>groaning,</hi> and thirſting in my Text? Do not theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that it is lawful to deſire death? Not ſimply in it ſelf, or for it ſelf, it is the ſeparation of thoſe two whom God hath coupled; it is a ceſſation of being; it is an evil of puniſhment, the daughter of ſin: to deſire it ſimply, were to deſire evil, which is abhorrent to nature; much leſs ought we to haſten our death by violent means. Let their memories be buried in perpetural ſilence, as the botches and ulcers of Chriſtianity, who out of impatience have perpetrated this heinous ſin, a ſin againſt God and man; againſt nature, againſt grace, againſt the Church, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common-wealth, againſt all things: The Heathen man could ſay, that we are the poſſeſſion of God, to be diſpoſed of by him, not by our ſelves: the body is the ſtructure of God, the work of his hands, the Tabernacle which he hath made, and not to be removed, or to be taken down, but by his command: while we live, we may advance the glory of God, the good of others; we may impeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple heaven, make up the ruines of Angels; to haſten our death, were to envy this glory to God, this good to others: In that diſtraction of our Apoſtle between two good things, his own glory, and the good of others; you know which way the ſcales inclined, to the good of others; as if he had ſaid, let my glory be deferred, ſo Gods glory be increaſed; let my joy be increaſed, let my joy be ſulpended, ſo the joy of Angels, and of the Court of heaven be intended by the converſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; Nay more, this is a ſmall thing; Let me be an <hi>Athema,</hi> ſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> be bleſſed, let me be <hi>blotted out of the book of life,</hi> ſo thouſands be inſerted; let the bowels of Chriſt be ſtreightned to me, ſo they be enlarged to others; this is life indeed, this is the end of our life: this will comfort us in this life, and crown us in the life to come. He that can truly ſay, that while he lived, he lived to God, not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he ſincerely propounded the glory of God, and the good of others unto himſelf; this man may write upon his Tombe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I have lived:</hi> take this out of the life of man, and what is it but a meer death, if not worſe, though it be protracted to the years of <hi>Methuſalem</hi> twice told? Thus, ſimply to deſire death is not good; but cloath this with ſome circumſtances, and then to deſire death is not only warrantable but commendable; when we have done all the good we can, when our lives will be no more ſerviceable to Church or Common-wealth, when we have with all fidelity done our Maſters work, when we have the teſtimony of a good conſcience, that <hi>we have fought a good fight, that we have kept the faith, that we have finiſhed our race;</hi> then may we ſay with old <hi>Simeon, Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace;</hi> then may we with our Apoſtle lift up our eyes to the <hi>crown of righteouſneſs, which the righteous Judge hath laid up for them that fear him;</hi> then <pb n="261" facs="tcp:47453:137"/>we may expect the <hi>Euge</hi> of the good ſervant, <hi>Well done good and faithful ſervant, enter into the joy of thy Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, when we are called to be <hi>Holocauſts,</hi> or ſacrifices, oblations of ſweet ſavours, the Frankincenſe of the Church to perfume others, to deliver up our lives unto God, to ſeal his Truth with our bloud to encourage others; then we ought to run unto death with all alacrity, <hi>rejoycing that we are counted worthy to ſuffer for his Name,</hi> to triumph, to boaſt in this out of theſe caſes, to have ſuch a taſte of God, ſuch a reliſh of the joyes of heaven, ſuch a longing after the preſence of Chriſt, as not to be ready, but to be willing; not to be prepared for the ſtroak of death, but to be deſirous of it, to eſteem of death as the funeral of ſin, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of vice, the period of miſeries, the Charter of freedome, the Pattent of exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from evil of ſin, from evil of puniſhment, the day of our birth, the ſeaſon of harveſt, the ſeal of our victory, the heaven of our happineſs, our introduction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, our inauguration into a kingdome; the Chariot of our triumph, the day of our return to our proper houſe, to our Parents, to our beſt friends. This is the affection which is required in us, at which we ought to aim. Let this <hi>houſe of clay</hi> be reſolved into the principles of the ſame, what wonder if that which is built be thrown down; and that which is compounded, be reſolved; and that which was borrowed of the Elements, be repayed again; and that which was taken from the earth, be committed to the cuſtody of the earth. Nay, let me triumph in the reſolution of this peece of clay into the exileſt atome, and admire the counſel of God, that this Carkaſs is crumbled into the ſmalleſt duſt, and ſifted into the courſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bran, even to duſt and aſhes; were not this body reſolved into duſt, who would beleeve his original to be from the earth? what pride, what elevation would follow? what carking and caring for this <hi>earthly Tabernacle?</hi> if now when we ſee it to be but a ſpawn of worms, and the food of Emmits, there is ſuch immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exceſs; what would there be if the body were exempted from putrifaction? what deſolations would follow in Cities, in Towns? how many would dwell in monuments with thoſe whom they have honoured, or affected in their lives? if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now be ſo impotent, that though the body be putrified, they cannot forbear imbracing of it, and to ſolace themſelves, make Pictures of their dead friends, and dote upon theſe; what would they not do if their bodies were immortal? What neglect would there be of the ſoul, the better part of a man? who would know the vertue of it, that it is not only ſalt to the body to keep it ſweet, but the life, the beauty, the comlineſs of the body? Who would beleeve the conſummation, the period of the world, if our bodies were immortal? who would mind heavenly things? who ſeek thoſe things that are above? what deifying of the body would follow? what Idolatries? what ſuperſtitions? what Temples built? what Alters erected? what variety of Ceremonies inſtituted to the body? All which God hath pluckt up by the roots, by this putrifaction, and incinneration of our bodies, by this, teaching us to contemn earthly things, to have our cogitations on heaven, to think upon this ſcale, to aſcend up to this Mount, to aſpire to this intention, which that we may, let me add fuel to the fire, and oyle unto the flame, the expreſſion of this aflection, to the intention of it, earneſt groaning, to eager deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this we groan earneſtly.</hi> That is, for this we ſigh out, not our breath, but our ſpirits: we groan out, not fuliginous vapours, but our very hearts, we weep not tears but bloud; for this we immolate the ſufferings of our bodies, and mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them with watchings and faſtings, we roul them in duſt and aſhes; we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them in all humiliation and repentance. And this is to <hi>groan earneſtly,</hi> in my Text.</p>
               <p>This is the negotiation of the outward man whereby it treads for heaven, this is the converſation of a piece of clay into a pile of frankincence; this adds wings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our <hi>Prayers;</hi> this openeth the ears of God; this diſſipateth the clouds of his countenance; this inclineth him to clemency towards us; this maketh the Widdow continent, and the Virgin unſpotted; this lifts up the voluntary Eunuch to the kingdome of heaven; this perfects the grace that is in the ſoul; this waſheth away <pb n="262" facs="tcp:47453:138"/>the ſtains, and contaminations that are in the ſoul; this is the beauty and comelineſs of a Chriſtian. How lovely were the Ninivites? how glorious was the King in ſackcloth, ſitting in his throne of duſt and aſhes? what were his Robes of Majeſty and Royalty to theſe ornaments, they might dazle the eyes of the body for a time, theſe dazle the eyes of the mind, even at this day, after ſo many hundred years; they might procure him honour with men, theſe made him honoured by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Let corporal eyes look upon an abject, and mean appearance of a King in theſe weeds, yet do not ſpiritual eyes ſee through theſe garments, Humility, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, ſubmiſſion, fear of God, and the like? and are there any Jewels like unto theſe? what are thoſe garments which are the labour of a worm, to theſe robes that are the works of Gods Spirit? What is a chain of Pearl, to a chain of warm and ſucceſſive tears, beaten out of the rocks of a broken and contrite heart? they may adorn the body, this adorns the ſoul; and which is more, binds the hands of God himſelf. Let whoſe will admire the victories and triumphs of <hi>David</hi> over the enemies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which are indeed worthy of admiration; I admire him in his watchings, and faſtings, and ſackcloth; by them he overcame fleſh and bloud; by theſe he overcame God; by them he overcame men, by theſe he made conqueſt of himſelf; by them he enlarged the territories of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by theſe he enlarged the bounds of heaven; by them he made <hi>Hadadezer</hi> fly, by theſe he made the Angel put up his ſword, and God to reverſe his ſentence; by them he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move temporal evils; by theſe he did procure everlaſting good unto himſelf and others. This is that humiliation which this ſacred time requires, not abſtinence only from meats which pamper this carkeſs; this is not the body of this faſt, but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement intention of religious duties above other times; he that prayed twice a-day before, let him now do it ſeven times; he that faſted but once in the week, let him now do it three times, or oſtner, as his body will permit him, though it be to the ſickneſs of the body, it is an happy ſickneſs of the body, which is the ſanctity of the ſoul; he that gave Almes a little, let him now double, or treble his liberality; he that did delight before in recreations, let him devote that time to prayer, to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: do not our ſins require this? our own ſins? the ſins of others? if not our own miſeries (for which we bleſs God) yet do not the miſeries of other Nations, the Churches of God require this? Do we not now beat our breaſts, and hang down our heads, and rend our hearts, and puniſh our ſelves for our ſins, that God may not puniſh them? Did not our ſins call upon us for this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet is not the ſight of God, the preſence of our Saviour, the joyes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the equality with the Angels, the glory of a Kingdome worthy a tear, a groan, a ſigh, a faſt, are they now ſo contemptible or mean, that no violence is requiſite? with what face ſhall we appear before our Saviour at his Tribunal, when he ſhall demand of us his tears, his watchings and faſtings? when he ſhall ſay unto us, were are my tears? are they <hi>water ſpilt upon the ground, not to be gathered up?</hi> Where are my ſighs and groans, have they vaniſhed in the ayr? where are my watchings? what not a tear, for ſo many tears? not a faſt, for ſo many faſts? not a groan for ſo many miſeries which I indured? Had I ſhed but one tear, ſhould it not have broken up a fountain of tears in thee? Had I ſetched but one ſigh, ſhould it not have made thy life a perpetual ſigh? But when I have done ſo much for thy ſake, ſhall it be loſt? wilt thou do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for thy own ſelf? ſhall I caſt ſo much ſeed into the ground, and reap no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing again.</p>
               <p>Oh my beloved, what are all our afflictions? what are all the afflictions of our ſelves, to the leaſt drop of gall that he taſted, to the leaſt ſcourge which he ſuffered? how can we ſay that either we loved God or our ſelves, if we do not theſe things in teſtimony of this. If ye ſhall not perform theſe duties, it is a ſmall comfort for us, that we have freed our ſouls? it is your ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we thirſt after, and ſay in a better ſenſe, then the King of <hi>Sodome; Da no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his animas, Give us your ſouls:</hi> and without this we have no comfort, we may be acquitted at the bar of God, but we ſhall not be crowned in his Throne; for what is our crown, but you that hear us; but if you ſhall thus groan, as I <pb n="263" facs="tcp:47453:138"/>doubt not but you do in ſecret, it is not I, but God himſelf hath promiſed. that <hi>they that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy:</hi> that they which mourn here, ſhall be comforted hereafter; that they which <hi>groan</hi> here, ſhall be refreſhed in their proper <hi>houſe; In this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from heaven.</hi> Which God of his infinite mercy grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </note> for the paſſage of glory, the contents of the whole Univerſe are not able to come neer the ſoul. Saith S. <hi>Bernard</hi> well, well it may be buſie, and took up with other things, but it cannot be ſatiate, and repleniſhed with them. And <hi>Democrates</hi> imagined, that if there were millions of worlds, it were all one in compariſon of the ſoul for bleſſedneſs. The world is tranſitory like the dew of the morning, it fades as the graſs, and as the flower of the field; whereas on the contrary, the ſoul of man is the ſubject of immortality, capable of an exceeding, ſurpaſſing, eternal weight of glory. For if in the time of grace we behold as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, and <hi>are changed into the ſame Image, from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> How reſplendant ſhall the ſoul of the righteous be, in the beatifical viſion of Gods excellencies?

Seeing then the Soul is capable, and is the ſubject of the happineſs, and joyes of heaven, and partner with the glorious Angels in the fruition of the chief good, let the ſentence of glory joyn to Grace and nature, that the Soul is of greater value then the whole world.</p>
               <p>Behold then, O man, out of the mouth of three witneſſes: (for I may ſay in this caſe, as Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith in another, <hi>There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Behold, out of the mouth of three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes) the ſurpaſſing excellency, and dignity of thy ſoul; it is the breathing of God, <pb n="268" facs="tcp:47453:141"/>the Image of God; he created it with his Word, redeemed it with his Son, and in whomſoever his grace abides, he will crown it hereafter with his glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>

<note place="margin">Plato. Aug.</note> ſaith <hi>Plato.</hi> And O wretched wight, ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> how haſt thou deſerved ſo much ill of thy ſelf, as among all thy goods, to be only thy ſelf bad? O remember the ſublimity of thy precious ſoul: thou knoweſt not what a precious pearle thou haſt in thy body, like the hidden treaſure in the Goſpel, it is of greater worth than the whole field. I ſay not as he did, know that thou haſt a God in thee, yet know that in that better part of thy nature, thou art like to God: for he hath given thee a ſoul of his own breathing, and ſtamped it with the impreſs of his own Image; and created it capable of the fruition of his own preſence in endleſs glory. In the conſideration whereof, walk worthily of this precious divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Thy Soul is a ſpirit, let thy thoughts be ſpiritual. Thy ſoul is immortal, let thy meditations be of immortality, and renounce thy body and good name, and gifts of the world, for the gainig of thy ſoul; <hi>for what ſhall it profit a man to gain the whole world, and to loſe his own ſoul?</hi> So much ſhall ſerve to be ſpoken of the firſt point: the ſurpaſſing excellency and dignity of the ſoul, it is vallued and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed here above the whole world.</p>
               <p>Now,
<note place="margin">The poſſibility to loſe the ſoul. Mat. 24.</note> the next is the poſſibility, that a man may loſe his own ſoul. The menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof cauſeth me to remember, that paſſage between Chriſt and his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. The Diſciples point Chriſt to the ſtately buildings of the Temple; but they were ſoon damped, when Chriſt told them, that after a while there ſhould <hi>not a ſtone, be left upon a ſtone.</hi> So perhaps, you are taken with admiration at the former part of the diſcourſe, concerning the excellency of mans ſoul, but are damped, to conſider that a man may loſe it. It is a ſubſtance immortal, in reſpect of the being of it; but defiled with ſin, it is adjudgeable to death in regard of the well-being; and a poſibility ſo to die, is nothing repugnant to the immortality of the ſoul. The damned ſpirits they are alwayes dying, and are never dead; they are alwayes deprived of Gods comfortable preſence, and are never releaſed of their helliſh torments; As the Apoſtle ſaith in another caſe, <hi>as dying, and yet behold they live; as living, and yet behold they die.</hi> The ſoul expiring is the death of the body, and God forſaking is the death of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay,
<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> how is it poſſible?</p>
               <p>The queſtion is ſoon reſolved,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> if we ponder the cauſes of death. A thouſand mortal maladies there are to kill the body,
<note place="margin">How the ſoul may be loſt.</note> and there are a thouſand deadly diſeaſes to deſtroy the ſoul. There is no ſin ſo ſmall, but in the rigour of Gods juſtice, and in its own nature, it way damn the ſoul.</p>
               <p>When God in the beginning ſtated man in Paradiſe, he gave him a ſpecial caveat about the tree of knowledg, he gives him a command thus; <hi>In the day thou eateſt, thou ſhalt die.</hi> What, for bare eating? No, beloved, but for the ſin, for tanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing ſo ſmall a commandement of ſo great a God. Sin alone makes a ſeparation between God and the ſoul, and cauſeth the death of the ſoul; <hi>the ſoul that ſins,</hi> the ſame <hi>ſhall die.</hi> It may teach us, that for the time that we live in this world, there is nothing eaſier then to ſin. There is a tree of Life, and a tree of Kuowledg, and by eating of the tree forbidden cometh death: there is a way of felicity, and a way to deſtruction; there is a God of ſalvation, and a ghoſtly enemy, and by adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the pricipality of ſin, a man may loſe his own ſoul.</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible then that a man may loſe his ſoul that is ſo precious?
<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> and have we not great reaſon to try, and to ſuſpect our ſelves, touching our ſtanding towards God? Is there not a main neceſſity to ſeek the means to preſerve us in the compaſs, and ſeals of grace? It is lamentable to conſider how in bodily diſeaſes men can open their grief, and ſeek for help, and ſend to ſome learned Phyſitian. We can go <pb n="269" facs="tcp:47453:141"/>to ſome noble learned councel, in caſe of law. But alas the ſoul lies wounded in the way, over laden with the grievances and preſſures of ſin, diſtracted with the affrightings of a troubled conſcience, as if there were no balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi> no Phyſitian there, as if there were no Miniſter to afford help. There is no ſeeking abroad: a <hi>Lyon</hi> is pretented to be <hi>in the way,</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> ſluggard, <hi>folds his hands to ſleep.</hi> O let not theſe things be ſo. <hi>Be not as the Horſe and Mule that have no underſtanding.</hi> Neglect not the helps of your preſervation in grace: but, be continually watchful with ſuſpition and jealouſie, and <hi>abſtain from fleſhly luſts, that fight againſt your ſouls.</hi> The Poet could ſay, Theeves riſe by night to rob, and kill, and ſteal, and wilt not thou wake to ſave thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>God (for the moſt part) ſaith Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath alotted to nature all by two's; two hands, two eyes, two feet, two ears; ears, eyes, hands, feet, two of all, that if we chance to maim one, we can help to relieve the neceſſity of it by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but he hath given us but one ſoul, if we loſe that, what ſhift ſhall we make for another ſoul? a piercing contemplation, if we had grace to conſider it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O my ſoul, tender thy ſelf as my own happineſs, if thou be tranſlated to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the body in time ſhall come thither; <hi>this corruption, ſhall put on incorruption; this mortal, ſhall put on immortality.</hi> Again, if thou be haled with the fiends to the nethermoſt hell, the body in time ſhall be tormented with thee.

In the diverſity of opinions concerning the chief good, ſome there were that placed it in riches; others in honours; and how ever they differed in their judgements, yet both agreed in this, that they were both deceived.

Leſt any man ſhould take them to be ill, they are beſtowed upon them that are good: leſt any man ſhould reckon them for the chief good, they are beſtowed likewiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the evil: external bleſſings are but common favours vouchſafed to good and bad.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if they be yours, take them away with you when you go hence. Yet the children of the world are wholly for <hi>great Diana,</hi> Gods of ſilver and gold, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of lands, and revenues, and advancing of their ſecular eſtate.</p>
               <p>Many can complain of the vanity of this world, and the deceivableneſs of it; but few complain of that Idolatrous confidence that themſelves repoſe in this falſe world: there are few that recount, how in enjoying outward things, <hi>Martha</hi> without <hi>Mary,</hi> proſperity without piety, they may loſe their own ſouls. O let a word of exhortation prevail againſt this ſore diſeaſe, <hi>if riches encreaſe, take heed of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> be covetous of ſpiritual <hi>things,</hi> for immortality, there hoard up your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in <hi>heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">1. Ambitious.</note> for ambition take heed of it, be honourable for humility, and ambitious for heaven; <hi>Love not the world, and the things of this world;</hi> exalt not your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord of glory. <hi>Thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth: boaſt not of to morrow. O fool, this night ſhall they fetch thy ſoul.</hi> And <hi>what is a man profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if he gain the world, and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> So much for the third point, the compoſſibility of outward proſperity, a man may loſe his ſoul, in gaining the whole world.</p>
               <p>The fourth and the laſt,
<note place="margin">The loſs by this gain.</note> is the woful diſadvantage by ſuch an exchange, <hi>What is a man profited?</hi> You may call it not unfitly the account of the careleſs Merchant; or a Summary collection of gains and loſſes. For (a little to countenance the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory) every unſatiable worldling is but merchant adventurer, a ventrous Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, he exchangeth his precious Soul for the deceivable riches of this world. But when God in his judgement tranſports him to his own place, the infortunate Iſland of damned ſpirits; then he begins when the time is paſt, to caſt up his doleful account, to campare his gains, and his loſſes; and after all the ennumeration of his imaginary <pb n="271" facs="tcp:47453:142"/>gain; ſo much by uſury, ſo much by extortion, ſo much by fraudulent dealing; the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſum is collected to his hand. <hi>What is a man profited?</hi> whence the obſervation might be this; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>When the gain of the world,</hi>

               <p>The bargain is ſuch, as that there is nothing gotten by it. That is too ſparing an expreſſion, it is ſhort of Chriſts meaning, who conceals the worſt, and refers it to our own collection: for (by the way) it were a happineſs to be nothing, it were profitable for the damned: but this comes neereſt Chriſts meaning, it is a loſs unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable, and ſuch as the world cannot countervail, when a man for the gaining of the world forfeits his ſoul. Let us ſee it in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if it be a man that glories in the reſplendency of his fortunes, and bleſſeth himſelf in magnifying his eſtate; a Commander of Kingdoms and Nations, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſer of preferments and dignities; yet</p>

<note place="margin">Jer. 17.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. <hi>As the Partridg gathereth young that ſhe brought not forth: ſo he that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the middeſt of his dayes, and at his end ſhall be a fool.</hi> What not before? Yes, he was alwayes a fool; but then by conviction, his own conſcience ſhall call him ſo; by the confeſſion of his own tongue, which ſhall call him ſo; by the proclamation of juſt men, they ſhall proclaim him ſo; <hi>Lo this is the man that took not God for his ſtrength, but truſted in the multitude of his riches, and ſtrengthened himſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 He loſeth the chiefe good.</note> having loſt his ſuppoſed good, he loſeth the fruition of God the chief good, the countenance of the beatifical preſence, the fellowſhip, and melodious harmony of the glorious Angels: his place and portion with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in the kingdome of heaven. And all proportionable to his own deſervings. In his life-time he refuſed God, being dead God refuſeth him: he turned his face from <hi>the poor and needy;</hi> God in his affliction eternally turns his face from him. A loſs ſo exceeding great, that whoſoever deſcends deepeſt in the meditation of it, yet he ſhall be at a loſs,
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> and to ſeek for a full definition of it: For as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> truly affirms, though a man tell thee of ten thouſand hells, all is one in compariſon of this miſery, to be diſcarded of bleſſedneſs and glory, and to be hated of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But if this be ſo,
<note place="margin">3. Poſſeſt of the greateſt ill.</note> what ſhall we ſay to further miſery? having loſt the chief good, he receives his puniſhment with hypocrites, and unbeleevers in the dungeon of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ill.

So that having come into the chambers of death and cloſed in the ſtraits of the grave; the man like the hedg-hogg, leaves the apples behind him, and only reſerves the prickles of a wounded ſpirit,

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> To prevent this miſery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</note> and to draw toward a concluſion: ſuffer the word of exhortation (brethren) and captivate your thoughts to the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt. You eſpecially whom God hath bleſſed above others, concerning the enjoyment of outward, temporal things. If ever you be deſirous to eſcape the direful ſlaughter-houſe of Hell; to eſcape thoſe burnings, and thoſe everlaſting yellings, while you have time, bethink your ſelves of ſome ſaving courſe to flie <hi>from the wrath to come.</hi> And now in time caſt up your accounts: take heed leſt for the love of this preſent world, you loſe your God, the life of your ſouls. <hi>There is a way that ſeems right to a man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) but the end of it is the manifold wayes of death.</hi> Some Babiloniſh garment, ſome <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, ſome ſweet preferment: but if the means be unlawful, if it diſturb conſcience, and prejudice the glory of God, and occaſion the deſtruction of thy ſoul, then ſay, <hi>What ſhall I doe when God ſhall riſe up? and when he ſhall viſit, what ſhall I anſwer?</hi> This will be the reckoning of fools at the laſt, <hi>What hath pride profited us? and what hath riches brought us?</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the gain will be no other then what <hi>Promethius</hi> is fabled to have had by <hi>Pandora's</hi> box, a place to be tormented.

Such will be the final iſſue of all Mammoniſts, that live amongſt Chriſtians, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der means of better reformation, and more ſanctification in their wayes; I ſay this will be the final iſſue. The worm of deſpair alway gnawing, and never dying; and the flames of eternal <hi>Tophet</hi> never to be extinguiſhed. Therefore in ſuch a caſe, if thou tell me thou knoweſt what thou doſt, and what thou gaineſt. Let me tell thee, thou little knoweſt thy dammage, and what thou haſt loſt. Alas, what are the goods of this life, when they are compared with eternal damnation? and the ſweetneſs of imaginary gain, what proportion hath it with the bitterneſs of ſo great a loſs? Riches have wings, they take their leave; honour is tranſitory; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures flie away: whereas the ſoul of man is the ſubject of immortality. And thy poor neglected ſoul muſt bide by it for an everlaſting pledge, and pay the debt.</p>
               <p>O! then, contemn this glory that is nothing; <hi>Firſt ſeek Gods kingdom, and the glory of it;</hi> ſuffer not heaven to ſtand at ſo great a diſtance to thy ſoul, <hi>taſte and ſee how gracious the Lord is,</hi> by one drop of water from that celeſtial fountain; by one crum from that heavenly table; and then as concerning the things below, thou wilt account them as droſs and dung, in compariſon of that joy, and peace of conſcience. Reſolve as <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> when he ſaw a goodly booty, he would not ſtoup to take it up: leave theſe things for the <hi>Children of this world.</hi> But let your care be to pleaſe the Lord, and to gain the peace of a good conſcience; <hi>Firſt ſeek the kingdom of God, which conſiſts not in meat and drink; but in righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Remember the vanity of the things of the world; remember how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the ſoul is to enjoy hell, and to loſe heaven without eternal horrour: and in conſideration hereof.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Angel having deſcribed to Saint <hi>John</hi> (in the Chapter immediately before, and in the former part of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) the exceeding great joy, and glory, and felicity, that all the godly ſhall have in the kingdome of heaven, by comparing it to a City built with precious Stones, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving twelve gates, and twelve foundations: wherein there is no darkneſs, they needing no candle, nor the light of the Sun: for Chriſt Jeſus the <hi>Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is the continual light thereof. And that therein is no miſery, no croſs, no imperfection; no want, no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, but continual joy and rejoycing. Where their ſongs are <hi>Halelujah,</hi> and their ſhields felicity, in the continual enjoying of the preſence of Almighty God, the glorious Trinity. Having, I ſay, thus deſcribed theſe joyes, he doth in the words of my Text, for the comfort of the godly, Who (<hi>have here no continuing City,</hi> but) are ſtrangers, and forreiners, and pilgrims, and travellers to another City, and ſeek a <pb n="254" facs="tcp:47453:144"/>Country. And in this their travel, they meet with many croſſes, and afflictions, and miſeries.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe for the terrour of the wicked, that make this world their kingdom, and are the chief Lords and commanders of the ſame: for the comfort of the one, and the terrour of the other, the Angel here in the perſon of Chriſt ſaith, he will <hi>come,</hi> and that <hi>ſhortly,</hi> to be a ſpeedy deliverer of the one, and a juſt Judge againſt the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold, I come ſhortly, and my reward is with me,</hi> &amp;c.<lb/>
In which words,
<note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note> obſerve theſe particular branches.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the word of preparation or attention, in the firſt word, <hi>Behold,</hi> which is as it were a Trumpet that ſounds before the coming of the great Judge, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding every one to fit, and prepare himſelf to hold up his hand at the bar, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly the Perſon, and that is the Judge himſelf, ſpeaking in the perſon of the <hi>Angel.</hi> I, Chriſt Jeſus himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, his action, <hi>I come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſpeedineſs of his coming, <hi>ſhortly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, the end of his coming to Judgment, and that is to <hi>reward every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, the quantity, and the quality of the reward incluſively ſet down; which is according to the quality of the works: for if the works be good, there ſhall be a great, and good reward, but if they be bad, the reward ſhall be according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The ſmall model of time will not ſuffer me to run over all theſe particulars: therefore my meditations, and your attention, ſhall be in one doctrine from the words in general; and that is this, that,<lb/>
                  <hi>Chriſt Jeſus will haſten his coming to Judgement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> Chriſt will come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reward the godly and ungodiy.</note> 
                  <hi>to reward the godly with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and eternal felicities: but the wicked and ungodly, with endleſs woe, and perpetual miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the proof of which doctrine, you may conſider theſe four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all the certainty, and celerity of Chriſts coming to Judgement.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſigns that prognoſticate his coming.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Judgement it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the end.</p>
               <p>For the certainty of Chriſt coming to judgement, I perſwade my ſelf that there is none here among you ſo ignorant, that he doth not know, or ſo Atheiſtical that he doth not beleeve: you know it is an Article of our belief, that he aſcended <hi>into heaven, and there he ſits at the right hand of his Father in glory, and from thence he ſhall come at the end of the world, to judge both the quick and the dead.</hi> Therefore I may ſpare the labour, and the time in any further proof of that.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the ſpeedineſs of his coming to judgement.
<note place="margin">The ſpeedineſs of Chriſtscom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> If ſo be the day of Judgement was at hand ſixteen ages ſince, as both Chriſt and his Apoſtles proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if then even in Chriſts dayes the <hi>ends</hi> of the world were come, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.11.1 Job. 2.18.1 <hi>Pec.</hi> 4.7.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. <hi>If then was the laſt time,</hi> as Saint <hi>John</hi> faith. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18. <hi>If then the end of all things were at hand,</hi> as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. can we think that now it is far off? Nay, ſo ſure, and ſo certain as God is God, and his Word is truth, and not one jott nor tittle <hi>thereof ſhall paſs away,</hi> he is neer at hand, <hi>he will come ſhortly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But,
<note place="margin">Two beneſits concerning Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> before we proceed, there lies two ſtumbling blocks in the way, that we muſt remove, wherewith many ſtumble concerning this point. In the time of the Apoſtles there were two hereſies confuted: the one by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the other by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3.1. Conſuted by S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </note> 3.3. he wills us to underſtand, that in <hi>the laſt dayes there ſhall come ſcoffers, men living after their own luſts,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> You preach ſo much that Chriſt Jeſus is coming to Judgement, and to <pb n="255" facs="tcp:47453:144"/>call every one of us to account for our wayes, our words and actions, but <hi>where is the promiſe of his coming? for all things continue alike from the beginning of the Creation.</hi> Miſerable men! that would be perſwaded that the day of Judgment ſhould never come, becauſe it was deferred: but ſuch jeſting, and mocking, and ſcoffing at this great and terrible day heretoſore uſed, and indeed now practiſed in the whole progeny of unheleevers, it may be an argument to us, that it ſhall not be deferred; for ſo ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3. <hi>when they ſhall ſay, peace, peace, and ſafety, then deſtruction ſhall come on them, as travel on a woman with child, &amp; they ſhall not eſcape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> anſwers theſe ſcoffers that asked, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> he gives them two anſwers; The one in verſ. 8. the other verſ. 9.</p>
               <p>In the eight verſ. he ſaith Chriſt defers notlong to come to judgement: for ſaith he, <hi>one day with the Lord is as a thouſandyears,</hi> &amp;c. alluding to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.4. <hi>A thouſand years in thy ſight,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 9 0.4.</note> 
                  <hi>are but as yeſterday, ſince they paſs as a watch in the night.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay? were it poſſible for a man to live a thouſand years; yet thoſe thouſand years in reſpect of God, aſ ſoon as they are paſt, they are as one day in reſpect of men: nay, they are but as a watch of the night; that is, but as three hours. The old Jewes they divided the night into four Watches, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to each Watch three hours; as may appear by comparing of theſe places of Scripture together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.24. <hi>Num.</hi> 14.25. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.38. So then the words bear this expoſition,
<note place="margin">Mat. 14.24. Numb. 14.25. Luk. 12: 38.</note> 
                  <hi>that a thouſand years in reſpect of God, are but as one day;</hi> nay, but as a <hi>Watch of the night;</hi> that is, but as three hours. It doth plainly ſhew to us, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> meant not to ſpeak diſtinctly of a thouſand years, but of a long time: ſo that his meaning is, innumerable years in reſpect of God, are but as one day. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> might as well have ſaid 2000. or 3000. or 10000. thouſand years in reſpect of God, are but as one day. Thus you have his firſt anſwer to thoſe ſcoffers, that ſaid, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His ſecond anſwer is in the ninth verſ. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe. Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> Why, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The Lord is not ſlack, as we account ſlackneſs.</hi> For we account them ſlack that goe ſlowly about a work, but God is not ſo to be accounted ſlack; but ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He is patient toward us, and would have none periſh, but come to repentance.</hi> Then the ſlackneſs of Chriſts coming is his patience, becauſe he would give us time to repent, and have us prepared before he come. O! then beloved, let us not make a mock as others do of this patience, but while we have time, let us take time, that when he comes we may be worthy of him. Thus you have the firſt hereſie confuted.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was quite contrary to this,
<note place="margin">2 By S. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </note> ſet abroach by certain falſe teachers, who taught the Theſſalonians, that the day of Judgement was ſo neer, that it ſhould happen in their age. Where (by the way) you may take notice of the exceeding great ſubtilty of the Divel, that labours by all means poſſible to bring men to one of theſe extreams. Either that the day of Judgement ſhall never come, or it ſhall come in ſuch a limited time and age. And indeed it is ranked among the opinions of ſome, that held that the day of Judgement ſhould be juſt 6000 years after the Creation, 2000. before the Law, 2000. under the Law, and 2000. under the Goſpel. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers theſe falſe teachers among the Theſſalonians,
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.</note> and all of the like opinion: therefore to arm them againſt their aſſaults, he bids them for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty beleeve it. 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2. <hi>that the day of judgement was not at hand.</hi> And he gives the reaſon verſ. 3. <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that day ſhall not come, except there he a depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt, and that man of ſin, the ſon of perdititon be revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how is it that the Apoſtle tells the Theſſalonians,
<note place="margin">Object.</note> that the day of Judgement was not at hand, ſeeing it is plain in the places before recited, that the end of the world was at hand, and that now was the laſt times?
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.26.</note> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Chriſt appeared in the end of the world.</hi> It was in the end of the world that Chriſt appeared to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice himſelf for our ſins; how is it then that he tells the Theſſalonians here, that the day of the Lord is not at hand?</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith the anſwer is eaſie:
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> for, ſaith he, in reſpect of God it was at hand, but as for us, we muſt be continually waiting for it. But Maſter <hi>Beza,</hi> and <pb n="256" facs="tcp:47453:145"/>
                  <hi>Rollock</hi> give another Expoſition, which I take to be more natural to the place: for, ſay they, in all thoſe places where it ſeems to be avouched, <hi>that the day of the Lord is at band:</hi> they underſtand the word in the Original, to ſignifie generally a time drawing neer. As to ſay the day of judgement may be this day as well as to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and to morrow as well as this day; and many dayes hence as well as now. But in that place where he ſaith it is not at hand, they underſtand the word preciſely, to be meant of a preciſe time: ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks truly, the day of judgement is not at hand, ſo as that any man can ſay, it ſhall be this hour, or this day, or this month, or this year, or this age. This is no more but the doctrine of Chriſt; <hi>Of that day and hour, no man knoweth, no not the Angels in heaven; no, not Chriſt himſelf as man, but the Father only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So you ſee it is plain and evident, that the day of Judgement is at hand; but in what preciſe limits of time or age it ſhall happen, it is uncertain. Our Saviour Chriſt tells his Apoſtles,
<note place="margin">Act. 1.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7. <hi>It is not for you to know the times, and ſeaſons, that the Father hath put into his own hands.</hi> It is not for you to know theſe times: Then beloved, why ſhould we have an ear to hear, where God hath not a tongue to ſpeak? Let it ſuffice us to know that it is at hand, which if we make good uſe of, it will make us wary and watchful, and Vigilant over all our wayes; that we ſay not with the evil ſervant, <hi>Our Maſter defers his coming;</hi> let us eat and drink, and beat our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſervants: but betake our ſelves to the good ſervants duty, <hi>to watch.</hi> Watch we therefore, <hi>we know not the day and hour, when the Son of man cometh.</hi> But when he cometh and finds us doing well, dealing faithfully, and living holily; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, nay thrice happy ſhall we be: we ſhall be ſure to partake of the bleſſing of thoſe upon mount <hi>Gerrazim,</hi> we need not fear the curſe of thoſe upon Mount <hi>Ebal.</hi> We need not be afraid of the Thundering, and lightning on <hi>Sinai,</hi> nor the fire, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, nor ſmoak of the furnace, nor of the ſound of the Trumpet: for all our joy ſhall be in Sion.</p>
               <p>But when he comes, if he find us living wickedly, dealing unfaithfully, curſed, nay, thrice curſed we be, we are ſure to partake of mourning for joy, of aſhes for beauty, of a rent for a girdle: whatſoever becomes of our garments, aſſuredly our hearts ſhall be rent in ſunder. <hi>Watch we therefore, we know not the day and hour, when the Son of man will come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond place,
<note place="margin">Signs of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> that the children of God may be armed, and prepared for his coming, he hath ſet down in his Word, certain ſigns which being effected, and come to paſs; they may eaſily judge, that then <hi>the day of redemption draweth nigh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe ſigns are of three ſorts.
<note place="margin">Of three ſorts.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Some are in reſpect of us a long time before he comes to judgement.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort are imediately before his coming.</p>
               <p>The third, in his coming.</p>
               <p>The ſigns that prognoſticate his coming long before are theſe;
<note place="margin">1. Long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The preaching the Goſpel to all the world. Mat. 24.14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt of all the preaching of the Goſpel to the whole world, which is ſet down by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.14. <hi>The Goſpel of the kingdome ſhall be preached to the whole world, for a teſtimony to all Nations; then ſhall the end be.</hi> Which words of our Saviour Chriſt we are not ſo to underſtand, as that the Goſpel ſhould be preached to the whole world at any one time: for that never was; nor I think never will be: but if we ſo underſtand it, that the Goſpel ſhall be preached to all Nations ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and at ſeveral times: then if we conſider the times ſince the Apoſtles, we ſhall find that the ſound of the Goſpel hath gone out to all the Nations of the world, as it was ſpoken by the Prophet: ſo that this firſt ſign is already paſt, the end can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be far.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſign is,
<note place="margin">2 The revealing of Autichriſt. 2. Theſ. 2.3.</note> the revealing of Antichrift, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 2.3. <hi>That day ſhall not come, except there be a departing, and that man of ſin, the ſon of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which is Antichriſt be revealed.</hi> Concerning this ſign, in the year of our Lord, 602. after Chriſt; S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſeemeth to avouch, that whoſoever taketh the name of univerſal Biſhop, and Paſtor of the Church, that was Antichriſt. Five years after, <hi>Boniface</hi> ſucceeding him, by <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour, had the title of Univerſal Biſhop of the Church, and ever ſince, all their ſucceſſours have taken that name, ſo that it is <pb n="257" facs="tcp:47453:145"/>evident that at <hi>Rome</hi> hath been, and now is, the Antichriſt; ſo that the ſecond ſign being fulfilled, the end cannot be far.</p>
               <p>The third is the general departure of the moſt from the Faith.
<note place="margin">3 General depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure from the ftaith.</note> There hath been a general departure in former times: when <hi>Arrius</hi> ſpread his hereſies, almoſt all the whole world became an Arian: and for the ſpace of 500 years together, from the time of <hi>Boniface,</hi> the world was ſo infected with Popiſh hereſies, that the faith of Chriſt could ſcarſely be diſcerned; they were as a handful of wheat to a great deal of chaff; ſo that this ſign it is already fulfilled in part; but there ſhall alway be a falling away, and a departing from the faith till Chriſt come to judgement.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſign ſtands in exceeding great corruption in the manners of men.
<note place="margin">4. Corruption in manners. 2 Tim 3.</note> And the Apoſtle makes this a ſign of Chriſts laſt coming to judgement, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>This know, that in the laſt dayes perrillous times ſhall come, men ſhall be lovers of themſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to parents, unholy, without natural affection, truce-breakers, falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, diſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traitours, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſures, more then lovers of God.</hi> The Apoſtle makes this a ſign and mark, that ſhall be in the laſt dayes. Beloved, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this were fulfilled in theſe dayes of ours: for there is a general corruption in the manners of men. It is very hard to find thoſe that in all truth and ſincerity, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to diſcharge a good conſcience towards God and men. And Chriſt hath ſaid himſelf, that when he comes to judgement, he ſhall ſcarſe find <hi>faith on earth;</hi> ſuch a general corruption there ſhall be in the manners of men: ſo that this fourth ſign being already paſt, the end cannot be far.</p>
               <p>The fifth ſign is exceeding great perſecution,
<note place="margin">5. Perſecution of the Church.</note> and affliction of the Church, and the Saints of God. This hath been fulfilled in former times. You know there were ten fearful perſecutions in the Primitive Church. And ſo it is fulfilled even in theſe dayes of ours: for the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that ſpotted beaſt; ſhe laboureth to make her ſelf drunk with the bloud of Gods Saints. There are but few years, nay, months, or weeks, wherein ſome of the bloud of Gods Saints is not ſacrificed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the wrath of the Perſecutors. Then if in theſe dayes, this ſign be fulfilled, the end cannot be far.</p>
               <p>The ſixt is a general ſecurity,
<note place="margin">6. General ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</note> ſo that men will not be moved, neither with the preaching of the word of God, nor yet with judgements from heaven: they have ſuch exceeding dulneſs and deadneſs of heart, that neither of theſe will move them.</p>
               <p>For the former, you know God hath ſent many judgements amongſt us; we have had fire, and famin, and peſtilence, and invaſion of forrein enemies; inundation of waters, thunder and lightning from heaven; but all theſe will not work upon our hearts. The Lord he hath ſcourged us oft, but yet we ſet light by his correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we harden our hearts againſt all his judgements, our hearts will not be ſoftned, and mollified; what effect hath all theſe wrought, where is our humiliation, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and reformation.</p>
               <p>And for the preaching of the word of God, alas that can get no entrance at all: mens hearts are ſo cruſty, and ſo hardned, that the ſeed of Gods word it lies unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, it takes no root at all in the heart; it works no reformation at all: ſo that if ever this ſign were fulfilled, it is in theſe dayes. It ſhall be ſaith Chriſt, (ſpeaking of the general ſecurity that ſhall be, when he comes to judgement) <hi>as in the dayes of Noah and of Lot, they were eating and drinking, and marrying, and giving in marriage,</hi> till the fire came from heaven and burned them, and the water over-flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the world: ſo that this ſixt ſign being paſt, the end cannot be far.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt ſign of Chriſts coming to judgement,
<note place="margin">7. Calling of the Jewes.</note> is the calling of the Jewes, which the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. calls the fulfilling of the Gentiles. When God hath the number of his Elect among the Gentiles, then the Jewes ſhall be called again: but of the time, and the manner, and number, the word of God doth not reveal it: ſo that it is likely this ſign is yet to come, all the reſt are fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore the end cannot be far.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of ſigns,
<note place="margin">2. Signs imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> are ſuch as are immediately before Chriſts coming to Judgement; and that is the darkneſs of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, <hi>The Sun ſhall be</hi> 
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:47453:146"/>
                  <hi>darkned, the Moon ſhall loſe her light; the St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rs ſhall fall from heaven, the very powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken, the foundations of the heavens ſhall tremble.</hi> Alas, what ſhall the little ſhrubs in the Wilderneſs do, when the tall Cedars of heaven ſhall be ſhaken? what ſhall poor ſinful man do, when the Angels ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid?</p>
               <p>The laſt ſign ſhall be in Chriſts coming to Judgement,
<note place="margin">3. In Chriſts coming.</note> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.29. it is called, <hi>the ſign of the Son of man; Then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of man; and then all the tribes of the earth ſhall mourn.</hi> What this ſign of the Son of man is, Divines do vary. Some hold it is the ſign of the Croſs, which all eyes ſhall behold, <hi>even they that pierced him,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Some others (which I rather aſſent unto) take it to be the glorious beams of
<note place="margin">Revel. 1.</note> Chriſts Majeſty, immediately before his perſonal appearance to enlighten the world, being darkned, by reaſon of the want of the light of the Sun and Moon. So you ſee what theſe ſigns ſhall be. The ſigns that prognoſticate Chriſts coming. Thoſe that ſhall be fulfilled long before, they are all effected, but one, as you heard. Therefore it ſtands us all upon, as wiſe Virgins, to prepare oyl in our lamps, that when our Bride-groom Chriſt ſhall come, we may be ready to enter into eternal joy. So we come from the ſigns that prognoſticate the judgement, to the judgement it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Concerning the judgement it ſelf;
<note place="margin">2. The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf.</note> You muſt know that after death there are two judgements;<lb/>
There is a particular, and there is a general Judgement.<note place="margin">Two Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The particular Judgement is immediately,
<note place="margin">1. Particular.</note> as ſoon as ever the breath is gone out of the body. As ſoon as ever the ſoul is gone out of the body, it is conducted by the Angels before the Tribunal ſeat of God, and there receives the particular ſentence, either of joy or torment, according as it lived in the body in this life. We need not ſpeak of this; we have example for the proof of it in Scripture, of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> the one whereof being dead, was preſently carried to joy, the other preſently to torment.</p>
               <p>The other is a general judgement;
<note place="margin">2. General.</note> ſo called, becauſe it ſhall be of all men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that ever lived, and breathed upon the face of the earth, men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; all ſhall be preſented before the Tribunal ſeat of Chriſt; all muſt hold up their hands at the Bar of his judgement; all muſt give an account of all their words, thoughts and actions: all muſt receive the ſentence either of, <hi>Come ye bleſſed,</hi> or, <hi>go ye curſed.</hi> After which ſentence once pronounced, there ſhall never queſtion be made of the end of the joy of the one, or the eaſe of the torments of the other.</p>
               <p>But here ariſeth a queſtion;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi>
                  </note> you know the world conſiſts but of two ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.24.</note> beleevers and unbeleevers. For the beleever it is evident and plain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.24 <hi>He is paſſed already from death to life;</hi> he hath everlaſting life already; he ſhall not come into judgement.
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.18.</note> And for the unbeleever it is as plain, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. that he is already condemned, even already: both are judged already, both the beleever and unbeleever; the beleever is ſaved already, the unbeleever is damned already, what need therefore a general, a ſecond Judgement?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Neceſſity of a day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that there is a very great need of it, both in reſpect of the juſtice, and of the mercy of God, whoſe property it is alway to reward the godly, and to puniſh the wicked, which ſeeing he doth not to the full in this life, it muſt needs be that a day will come that he will fully do it.</p>
               <p>You know the courſe of the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks; good men have bands in their death, and wicked men are luſty and ſtrong; good men are in evil condition; and wicked men in proſperity. <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cinnick, ſeeing <hi>Harpalus</hi> a thief long in proſperity; he was bold to ſay, that wicked <hi>Harpalus</hi> his living long in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, it was an argument to <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that God had caſt off his care of the world, that he reſpected not mens affairs. And indeed the proſperity of the wicked, hath brought the Saints of God to a ſtand. <hi>Davids</hi> foot ſlipped almoſt in ſeeing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity <pb n="259" facs="tcp:47453:146"/>of the wicked.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 37: Job 24.12. Jer. 12.</note> It made <hi>Job</hi> to ſay, <hi>Job</hi> 24.12. <hi>Men groan out of the City by reaſon of oppreſſion, and the ſouls of the ſlain cry out; and yet God chargeth them not with folly.</hi> This made <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> to expoſtulate his cauſe with the Lord, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 12. <hi>Let me talk with thee of thy judgments, Why doth the wicked proſper, and they that tranſgreſs thy commandements?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.11.</note> This makes the godly take up that paſſionate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.11. How doth God know it? <hi>is there any knowledg in the moſt high?</hi> Certainly, we have cleanſed our hearts in vain; in vain we have <hi>waſhed our hands in innocency:</hi> in vain we labour to live godly lives; Why? <hi>Every day we are chaſtened:</hi> for the Lord corrects us every morning. And theſe have the wealth of the world, they have the world at will, We in Chriſtianity know this to be true. <hi>Dives</hi> hath the world at will, while poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> is ſhut out of doors, hungry and thirſty, cold and naked, full of neceſſity every way. This being ſo, the day muſt needs come, that the one ſhall have fulneſſe of glory, and the other of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.</p>
               <p>But to anſwer thoſe places before cited. To the former, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. where it is ſaid, <hi>The beleever is paſſed already from death to life;</hi> he hath everlaſting life already. It is true, he is paſſed already from death to life, by faith he hath it already, and by hope; he ſhall not come into judgement; that is, of condemnation, (ſo we muſt underſtand it,) but there is a judgement of abſolution that is to be executed; and ſo when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall deſcend from heaven with the ſound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, <hi>and the voyce of the Archangels, then the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt, and be caught up in the clouds to meet Chriſt,</hi> and then they ſhall be ſet at his right hand, and hear that heavenly ſentence; <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you, before the beginning of the world.</hi> You ſee the anſwer to that, that beleevers ſhall not come into judgement; that is, not the judgement of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but of abſolution at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Now for the other place,
<note place="margin">Unbeleever condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready how.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. the unbeleever is condemned already.</p>
               <p>It is true, he is condemned already, and that three wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, he is condemned already in the counſel of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he is condemned already in the word of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he is condemned already in his own conſcience.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the counſel of God; God hath made an eternal decree of Predeſtination, whereby he hath elected ſome to ſalvation, and predeſtinated them thereto, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to damnation. In this Gods eternal decree, the unbeleever is already condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: nay, before ever he came into the world, as you have it in the example of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>, Rom.</hi> 9. before ever they had done good or evil, God hated the one, and loved the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the word of God he is condemned, <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.18. Why? becauſe he hates the light, and loves darkneſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in his own conſcience he is condemned: for the continual horrour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of gives him no reſt, day nor night; there is a worm continually gnawing there, and a ſting tormenting him: but the full execution thereof is to be in the day of wrath, when he ſhall be ſet at the left hand of Chriſt, and hear the ſentence, <hi>Goe ye curſed into eternal fire, prepared for the divel and his Angels.</hi> O, what a terrible day will this be to all the wicked workers of iniquity: for Chriſt Jeſus the Judge ſhall come then, to give them their reward. This ſhall be a black, a ſad, a woful, diſmal day to them: they ſhall not be able to look on the Judge, he ſhall be ſo terrible to them. You ſee the terriblneſs of the Judge ſet down by Saint <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Revel. 20.10, 11.</note>

Indeed if a man could preſent himſelf ſpotleſs without blame, he needed not to fear; but alas it is far otherwiſe, there is none that doth good, and ſinneth not, ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> The moſt righteous before men are ſtained, and poluted in the ſight of God; and may cry with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <pb n="260" facs="tcp:47453:147"/>

He is ſinful in his birth, in his life, in his thoughts, his words and actions; and ſhall he that is thus ſpotted, and ſtained, and polluted, ſtand before the pure Judge of heaven and earth without trembling? ſurely no; <hi>The mighty, the Kings of the earth, the Captaines, high, and low, of what condition ſoever;</hi> as many as have not made their garments white in the bloud of the ſlaughtered Lambe Chriſt, they ſhall tremble, and flie to hide themſelves; and <hi>cry to the mountains to cover them,</hi> before the face of this glorious Judge.</p>
               <p>We come now to the laſt thing, and that is the end of Chriſts coming to Judgment. The end of Chriſts coming you know is to give a reward.
<note place="margin">4. The end of Chriſts coming.</note> And this reward ſhall be both to the wicked, and to the godly: for he ſhall give the reward according to every mans work.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will ſpeak of the reward of the wicked.</p>
               <p>And after conclude with the reward of the godly.</p>
               <p>The reward of the wicked ſhall be endleſs woe,
<note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked.</note> and perpetual miſery in hell. There was never any man that deſcended into that fiery lake, and returned thence to tell us, what torments are provided for the wicked in Hell: but yet as by one drop of the Sea water, you may conceive of the ſaltneſs of the reſt; and as a man may gheſſe at the ſtature of a Giant, by the length of his foot; even ſo we may have ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of thoſe endleſs and eaſeleſs, and remedileſs torments prepared for the wicked in hell, by a taſte of the miſeries we have in this life. Great may the grief of a mans heart be, even in this life, as great as mortality is able to bear. Can we read of the mourning of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> of <hi>Hannah,</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and not be moved? our hearts are hard. Can we read of the hideous torments invented by Tyrants, Caldrons of boyling oyl, roaſting upon ſpits, tumbling down Mountains in barrels of nails, rending of joynts with horſes; can we read of theſe mercileſs torments, and not be moved? our hearts are harder then a milſtone. Alas, beloved, theſe are nothing but ſhadows, but counterfeit to thoſe torments that are prepared for the wicked in Hell. For though the bowels of hell labour to empty the bowels of judgtment, yet ſhe hath an immeaſurable portion for her children now living; nay, for thoſe that are unborn, a patrimony of blackneſs, of brimſtone, of the wrath of God, of wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth. Certainly, death ſhall take them away, but they ſhall never die; they ſhall conſume for ever, and yet ſhall not be conſumed; they ſhall be in fire unquenchable,
<note place="margin">Pſal 60.3. Iſa. ult. Ezek. 38, 12. Rev. 14, 10.</note> and yet ſee no light. You may read of <hi>the wine of giddineſs, Pſal.</hi> 60.3. of a ſtrange kind of <hi>Worm, Iſa. ult.</hi> of fire and brimſtone, <hi>Ezek</hi> 38.22. of the <hi>Wine-preſs of Gods wrath, Revel.</hi> 14.10. All theſe, and if worſe then theſe can be, are prepared as ſo many torments for the wicked workers of iniquity. Their cup is the deadlieſt that ever was drunk, even of Gods wrath wherewith they ſhall be filled for ever; their worm is that that continually gnaws upon the conſcience: they ſhall be tormented in fire and brimſtone, before the Lambe and his Angels: Not ſuch as that of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> for then there were hope that they might be converted at the laſt into heaps of Aſhes, or pools of Pitch; but ſuch fire and brimſtone, that as a bottomleſs Mine gives them neither reſt night nor day, the ſmoak of it aſcending for ever; and is appointed for a time, &amp; times, till time ſhall be no more. Their torment in ſuch a meaſure, <hi>as neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard, nor heart of man hath conceived.</hi> But, beloved, all this is but general; if the time would ſuffer, we could ſhew the torments of the damned in particular; as,</p>

<note place="margin">Eternity of the torment of the wicked.</note> the eternity of thoſe torments, in that they ſhall never end; and I verily perſwade my ſelf, that this is a great increaſe of their torments, the very conceit and thought that they ſhall never end, it is a great increaſe and aggravation of the torment. You know there is no grief and ſorrow, or miſery in this life, but time will either deminiſh it, or take it quite away; either the tormented, or the tormentor will die: but in hell there you have them tormented day and night, for ever and ever, neither the tormented, or the tormentor die, but they live to endleſſe woe. O! ſaith a godly Father in his meditations, if a wicked ſinner in Hell did know that he were to continue there no more thouſands of years, then there are ſands upon the Sea-ſhore, or no more millions of Ages, then there are piles of graſſe upon the ground, yet this would he ſome comfort, that at laſt they ſhould have an end; but this word <hi>never,</hi> it bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Extremity of torments.</note> we might note <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the extremity, and ſtrictneſs of thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the ſtraitneſs of them, there is no mercy ſhewed; <hi>Take him, and bind him hand and foot, and caſt him into utter darkneſs.</hi> And again, the gate is ſhut, after the ſinner is once caſt into Hell, there is no getting out again, the gate is ſhut.</p>
               <p>The ſtraitneſs of theſe torments may be exceedingly laid down to us, in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the rich Glutton, who in hell roaring in everlaſting flames, lift up his eyes, and ſaw <hi>Abraham</hi> a far off, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his boſom; he deſired <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſend <hi>Lazarus</hi> but to dip the top of his finger in water, to cool his tongue: a ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: he asks not to be delivered from his torments; or for a flaggon of water, but for a drop; yet to ſee the ſtrictneſs of thoſe torments, it was denied him. <hi>Dives</hi> had before, the world at will, what his heart could deſire: but <hi>Lazarus</hi> comes to his gate full of ſoars and hungry, yet he refuſed to refreſh him with crums from his table; ſee the juſt judgement of God againſt the mercileſs wretch. <hi>Dives</hi> refuſed to give a crum; when he asked he is denied one drop. So that as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks,
<note place="margin">Iam. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. <hi>there ſhall be judgement mercileſs to them that yeeld no mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beloved, all you that have the wealth of the world, remember this example, when the poor diſtreſſed members of Chriſt come to your gates, ſhut not up the bowels of compaſſion, open your hands, and your hearts to relieve them: for as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>there ſhall be judgement mercileſs to thoſe that ſhew no mercy.</hi> But I come to the laſt thing that I will but only name; that is, the reward of the godly, that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
<note place="margin">The reward of the godly.</note> eternal felicity in heaven. The time will not ſuffer me to ſpeak largely, and particularly of the reward of the godly, which is a great incouragement, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to the ſervants of God. I will only ſpeak in general. The Prophets when they ſpake of the Kingdome of Chriſt, they ſet it out by good things; there is no need of their good things; <hi>Nation ſhall not riſe againſt Nation, they ſhall break their ſpears into mattocks.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 2. Iſa. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>The wolf ſhall dwel with the lambe, and the Leopard with the Kid; They ſhall eat of the tree of life, and the hidden Manna there. They ſhall be made pillars in the Temple of God.</hi> There they ſhall be cloathed with <hi>long white robes.</hi> Which places take us by the hand, and bring us to ſome conceit of thoſe joyes.</p>
               <p>How then doth it ſtand every one upon now, while we have time, to labour to have intreſt in thoſe joyes? Thrice happy is that man or woman, that comes to enjoy thoſe joyes. It is ſpoken of Chriſt, that he, the joyes of heaven being ſet before him, <hi>he ſuſtained the croſs.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> accounted all but <hi>dung that he might win Chriſt,</hi> and come to thoſe joyes. And <hi>Ignatius</hi> faith, that breaking of bones, fire, and gallows, quartering of limbs, come what will, ſo I may come to thoſe joyes. I would we had all the like zeal after thoſe joyes. Our coldneſs in ſeeking thoſe joyes come from a baſe eſteem of them, for if we did eſteem them, we would labour exceedingly after them.</p>
               <p>Many things for uſe might be inferred hence.

               <p>It hath pleaſed God to give me a fit one, but a very ſad accaſion; It is the Lord, <hi>let him do what ſeemeth good in his eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will go over the words in particular, and obſerve ſomething out of them. And then out of altogether, I will raiſe this Doctrine; that,<lb/>

               </p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt.
<note place="margin">Looking, four things in it.</note> The firſt word is <hi>Looking,</hi> and it hath in it theſe four things;</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. Earneſtneſs.</note> earneſtneſs: a Saint of God muſt look, and look earneſtly. The Apoſtle when he ſets down the looking of the creatures (for the creatures look too together with us, to be <hi>freed from the bondage of corruption, in the glorious liberty of the Sons fo God;</hi> when he ſpeaks of the looking of the creature) he uſeth a ſtrange word which ſigniſieth a putting out of the head, looking to ſee what it can eſpie a great way off, to ſee if there be any ſign of his coming,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. And he tells us that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not only put out the head and look, but waits, and groans, and ſighs, and travelleth as a woman in pain: and quoth the Apoſtle, <hi>not only the creatures do thus, but we that have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit.</hi> Nay, if the creature put out the head, and groan, and wait, and is in pain till that day come, how much more ſhould we that have the firſt fruits of the ſpirit? Earneſtneſs, that is one.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing is Patience.
<note place="margin">2. Patience.</note> 
                  <hi>If</hi> (quoth the Apoſtle) <hi>we hope for that we ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ot, then do we with patience wait for it.</hi> There is <hi>patientia ſpei;</hi> The Theſſalonians are commended for it,
<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 1.3. Heb. 10.36.</note> in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>The patience of hope.</hi> And as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Opus eſt vobis patientia, you have need of patience</hi> in this look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for conſidering,</p>
               <p>Firſt of all,
<note place="margin">1. The time is uncertain.</note> that the time is not known to us, when this Lord will appear. <hi>It is not for you to know the times and the ſeaſons, that the Father hath kept in his own power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And conſidering ſecondly,
<note place="margin">2. It ſeems long.</note> that that time, either longer or ſhorter, may ſeem to be long, <hi>omnes celeritas in deſiderio;</hi> All haſt that can be made, is but delay to a man that languiſheth in deſire: hence comes thoſe often, <hi>uſque quo? how long Lord? how long?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">2. Gods ſtrange work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> conſidering, (as the very heathen man could call them) thoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous workings of God. It is many times ſeen, that Gods working ſeems to go againſt his word.</p>
               <p>And then fourthly, conſidering how buſie the Divel is to diſcredit the truth of Gods promiſe, and to weaken our faith, I ſay again with the Apoſtle, <hi>you have need of patience.</hi> There is the ſecond thing.</p>
               <p>There is a third thing neceſſary,
<note place="margin">3. Joy.</note> that is, Joy to think of this ſame day. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>there is a crown of righteouſneſs laid up for me, and not for me only; but for all them that love, that appearing;</hi> and where love is, there will be joy; joy is a ſweet motion of Gods ſpirit: ſpiritual joy, I ſpeak of that; either upon the fruition of ſome good thing preſent, or the expectation of future; <hi>there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing under the hope of the glory of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> Rom. 5.2. And faith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, whom you have not ſeen, and yet love, whom though you ſee not, you beleeve, and beleeving you rejoyce, with a joy unſpeakable and glorious.</hi> It is ſuch a joy, as the world cannot give us; and ſuch a joy, as the world cannot take from us.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">4. Diligence</note> this looking hath alſo with it, a care and diligence to prepare our ſelves againſt that coming. Mark the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. faith the Apoſtle, <hi>Seeing we look for theſe things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>let us uſe all diligence, that we may be found of him in peace.</hi> You know how the wiſe Virgins, becauſe they looked for the Bridegroom, they <pb n="265" facs="tcp:47453:149"/>had trimmed their lamps, and made all things ready to meet him. So then where this excellent looking for this bleſſed hope is, there will be all theſe;<lb/>
An earneſtneſs firſt.<lb/>
And then a Patience.<lb/>
And then a Joy.<lb/>
And then a diligence to meet him, to make our ſelves ready for him.<lb/>
Doſt thou not look earneſtly?<lb/>
And doſt thou not look with patience?<lb/>
And doſt thou not joy to think of this coming?<lb/>
Then thou doſt not look as thou ſhouldeſt do.<lb/>
But the next word is, Looking for what?<lb/>
                  <hi>The bleſſed Hope.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bleſſed hope.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Hope is put for the thing hoped for; <hi>the bleſſed hope,</hi> is the <hi>hoped for bleſſedneſs;</hi> and this conſiſts in two things;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A freedome</hi> from all ill, both of ſoul and body.</p>
               <p>And a fruition of all good, both in ſoul, and body, in the whole man.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. In freedome from all ill.</note> this <hi>bleſſed hope</hi> conſiſts in this, in a freedom from all ill. Firſt, that there ſhall be no more blindneſs in our underſtandings; no more rebellion in our wills; no more terrour in our conſciences; no more weakneſs in our memory; no more ſin, no more power to ſin; here is a <hi>non poſſe pecari.</hi> No more temptations of Satan; no more allurements of the world; no more frailties of the fleſh; no more hunger, no more thirſt, no more wearineſs, no more ſickneſs; no more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome in the head, no more palſie in the hand; no more gout in the feet; no more diſeaſes, and no more death. For if we ſhall be freed from corruption; how much more ſhall we be freed from vexation, and infirmity, and deformity. Here is freedome from ill.</p>
               <p>Well,
<note place="margin">2. To enjoy all good.</note> here is not all; it is not enough to be freed from ill: but here is the ſecond part of this <hi>bleſſed hope,</hi> to enjoy all good.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this is our bleſſed hope, that the Image of God ſhall be wondrouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in our fouls; and all the faculties of it. This is our hope that God ſhall be to our underſtandings fulneſs of light: that he ſhall be to our wills abundane of peace; to our memories a continuation of eternity. In a word, God ſhall be <hi>All in all.</hi> This is our <hi>bleſſed hope,</hi> that this <hi>vile body of ours,</hi> as vile as it is (as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>a body of vileneſs</hi>) it ſhall be raiſed up again, and made like the glorious body of Chriſt by that <hi>mighty working: that this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption,</hi> and this very <hi>mortal, ſhall pus on immortality.</hi> I, and this is the <hi>bleſſed hope,</hi> that both in ſoul and body being bleſſed, we ſhall be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the <hi>Congregation of the firſt born.</hi> Where we are ſure never to find any enemy, and we are ſure never to loſe a friend. Where we ſhall have the ſociety, and company of Gods Saints, and of the bleſſed Angels. And in the beatifical viſion and fruition, and communion of God, we ſhall have ſuch joy, as <hi>neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor tongue can expreſs:</hi> ſuch joy as cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſhall never be ended.</p>
               <p>Oh, bleſſed be that God, that is the author of this hope; and bleſſed is the man that is partakers of this hope.</p>
               <p>But when will this be? for quoth the Apoſtle, <hi>If our hope were only in this life, of all men</hi> living, <hi>we were moſt miſerable.</hi> Why, but when muſt we look for it then?<lb/>
                  <hi>At the appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the glorious appearing.
<note place="margin">Appearing of Chriſt, two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> The word is at the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> at the appearance of glory, at the glorious appearing. There is a twofold Epiphany of Chriſt: an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphany of grace, that was his appearing in our fleſh, to work the work of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And then there is an Epiphany of glory here ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:47453:150"/>There was no glory,
<note place="margin">1. In the fleſh in humility.</note> in the firſt <hi>Epiphany,</hi> and appearing of Chriſt. It was no glory for the Creator to become a creature, for the Lord, to become a ſervant; for the Word to become an Infant. He was our joy, and yet he ſorrowed; he was our ſtrength, and yet he was weakned: he was our confidence, and yet he ſeared: he was our Saviour, and yet he ſuffered: he was our life, and yet he died. There was no glory in that. He came to be <hi>minor Patre, leſs then his Father:</hi> but that is not all, yet he might have become a glorious creature, as the Angels are glorious creatures. No, it was leſs then thus; he was a little lower then the Angels, in that he was made man. But in that he ſuffered, he was a great deal leſs then a man: he was a little leſs then an Angel, in that he was made man, but in that he ſuffered, he was a great deal leſs then a man. For what was he? hark what <hi>David</hi> faith in his perſon,

                  <hi>I am a worm and no man, the very off-ſcouring of men, the out-caſt of the people:</hi> there was no glory in his firſt appearing.</p>
               <p>But now his ſecond appearing ſhall be in glory,

               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">4.

What glory will he get when he ſhall throw the Divel, and wicked men into hell fire? there is glory in his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of juſtice.</p>
               <p>Then glory in his Saints,
<note place="margin">5. Saints. 2 Theſ: 1: 10.</note> as the Apoſtle, <hi>I Theſ.</hi> 1.10. faith, <hi>that God ſhall be marvellous glorious in his Saints. For when Chriſt that is our glory ſhall appear, then we alſo ſhall appear with him in glory.</hi> Here is the glorious Epiphany of Chriſt, a glorious appearing.</p>
               <p>But of whom?</p>
               <p>The great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Some there are that would make theſe two, to be two perſons. <hi>The great God,</hi> ſay they, that is God the Father; and <hi>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, God the Son. Thus the Arrians; thus the Semi-Arrians; and thus (which I wonder at) <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and thus ſome others.</p>
               <p>But firſt of all, you never find in the New Teſtament of the Epiphany of God the Father: that ſame glorious Epiphany is ever of the Son.</p>
               <p>Then the Greek makes it plain me-thinks: for had there been two perſons, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhould have ſaid thus, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>

               <p>There is a general Doctrine to be touched, which I can but touch, in a word it is this;<lb/>
                  <hi>Every true Chriſtian muſt ſo live,

                        <hi>Doctr.</hi> Every Chriſti. an ſo to live, as expecting the appearing of Chriſt.</note> as a man that waites, and looks for this bleſſed hope, at that glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The holy men that lived before Chriſts firſt Epiphany, his firſt coming here in the fleſh, they are deſcribed thus, to be men that looked for that coming. After his coming, <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſs, the Scripture faith, <hi>ſhe ſpake of Chriſt, to all that looked for redemption in Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 2.36.</note> Luke 2.36. and in verſe 25. it is ſaid, <hi>that old <pb n="268" facs="tcp:47453:151"/>Simeon, a devout man, and one that looked for the conſolation of Iſrael.</hi> And the like is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Aremathea, he was a juſt man, one that feared God, and looked for the redemption of the people of God:</hi> he looked for <hi>the kingdom of God.</hi> There was looking then.</p>
               <p>And the Children of God now in the New Teſtament, they are all deſcribed by this, looking for the ſecond coming of Chriſt. Gods children are ſtill looking for this ſecond coming. Let me give you but a place or two of Scripture. The Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20. Jude 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God, as men that look for the mercy of God, at that great day, to eternal life. Gird up your loyns,</hi> ſaith our bleſſed Lord, <hi>and let your lights be burning in your hands,</hi> that you may be as men that look for the coming of the Bridegroom.</p>
               <p>Indeed, beloved, if we look into the lives of men, I cannot tell, whether I ſhall ſay, they look for his coming or no; <hi>this bleſſed hope.</hi> Wilt thou prophane the ſanctified day of reſt? wilt thou blaſpheme the great and glorious name of God? wilt thou wantonly abuſe the creatures of God, in drunkenneſs? wilt thou lie, and ſteal, and whore, and yet tell me thou lookeſt for that <hi>bleſſed hope?</hi> ſurely thou doſt not. If quoth the Apoſtle, we do look for theſe things (in the place named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.)
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14.</note> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Then let us do our diligence, that we may be found of him in peace.</hi> If thou do not thy diligence, that when he comes, thou maiſt be found in peace, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tell me thou lookeſt for him.</p>
               <p>There was never time yet for us to lie, and wallow in ſin, to think nothing that we do diſhoneſt: there was never time for theſe things ſince time was. Surely there is no time for it now. All the dayes ſince Chriſt, are called the laſt dayes; all of them are the laſt dayes, ſince that day of the firſt <hi>Epiphany:</hi> but there is a day that will be the laſt of all thoſe laſt dayes. And me-thinks it will not be long before that laſt day of all come: me-thinks I ſee the day broke already, it is break of day already. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brethren, if you do indeed look for the coming of Chriſt, for this <hi>bleſſed hope,</hi> at his appearing, <hi>be diligent, that you may be found of him without ſpot, in holineſs.</hi> I have done with the Text.</p>
               <p>I come now to the occaſion at this time. You have brought hither, a dead body of a very good neighbour of ours, and whom I acknowledg, I ever found a kind, and a loving friend. You have brought it here to be laid up in the Grave, in hope of a bleſſed and joyful reſurrection. I need not ſpeak much of his life here: an ancient inhabitant; When it pleaſed God to call me firſt to this place 26. years ſince, I found him then in the chief office of the Church; and divers times ſince he hath been in it: and I have ſeldome known any more painful, and more induſtrious, and more honeſt in thoſe places then he was. We have all known him a man humble in his converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, juſt of his word, true in his promiſes, merciful in his dealing, charitable to the poor, ready to every good work. His life was ſuch a life; as the Apoſtle would have ours to be, a life ſober, and juſt, and pious in this preſent evil world. He lived, and lead a life pious, in regard of God, juſt in the regard of men, ſober in regard of himſelf; I can ſay no leſſe of him, and I will ſay no more of him.</p>
               <p>I know you deſire to hear of his death, and it hath much afflicted my ſoul, to hear what unjuſt aſpertions have been upon the manner of it. There was a ſudden ſtroak indeed of Gods hand; and it was in my houſe, and ſeeing that it ſo pleaſed God, I am glad that it was in my preſence and ſight, that I might give the better teſtimony of it. The ſuddenneſs of the ſtroak made him liable to ſome miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and hath given many men occaſion to paſſe a very uncharitable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian verdict of him.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you let me give you a true naked relation how it was. I never knew any men of ſo peaceable a diſpoſition, but there might be ſometimes ſome difference between them: there was between <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas;</hi> and there was between another honeſt neighbour and him; both men of a peaceable diſpoſition. They did not deſire to go to law; they deſired the matter might be put to Arbitrators; they choſe four honeſt Gentlemen to take up the matter between them; they made me as an unworthy Umpire, in caſe they did <pb n="189" facs="tcp:47453:151"/>not agree. On Thurſday laſt they met, and each of them pleaded their cauſe. And let me ſay thus, that if this brother of ours had been judg'd to do any wrong in that cauſe; if he had uttered one word of falſhood to help his cauſe, if he had uſed one word of imprecation, wiſhing any curſe to himſelf; then it had been peradventure, a juſt thing with God, to have taken him at his word. If he had ſworn one oath, if he had uttered but one uncharitable word againſt his neighbour; if he had ſhewed but any malice or ſpleen againſt him; if he had been but tranſported with paſſion, as a man may eaſily be in his own cauſe, we are but men. I ſay, if he had been but tranſported with paſſion; then peradventure ſome men might have thought it had been the ſtroke of divine juſtice upon him; but let me tell you, I have the witneſs of honeſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that were the arbitrators, and will juſtifie.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that his cauſe was good, and that there was not one word ſpoken, but was confirmed by honeſt witneſſes preſent.</p>
               <p>Then, he uſed no kind of imprecation in the world; no, not as I remember, ſo much as a proteſtation; or any aſſeveration, there was not one oath ſworn, either by him, or by others that were preſent.</p>
               <p>There was not one uncharitable word ſpoken by him: there was not any malice, or ranckour, or hatred appeared, either on the one ſide, or the other between them; he was no way tranſported with paſſion.</p>
               <p>He did plead his cauſe, but with that meekneſs of ſpirit, with that quietneſs, with that ſweet temper, and that Chriſtian moderation, as more could not be required in any Saint of God. Therefore brethren, let me only tell you thus much, while this was in agitation, I could not perceive that he was moved at any thing; he was not ſtirred, he was not earneſt in his cauſe. Till it pleaſed God to touch him; and he had ſome ſenſe and feeling of it: riſing from his ſtool, he ſate rubbing of his cheek, or his neck with his handkercheif. He fell upon the neck of a Gentleman that ſate cloſe to him, who perceiving that he was not well, asked him how he did? he was ſcarſely able to give us an anſwer, I perceived that he was ſtricken with the dead palſie. Brethren conſidering theſe things that I have told you before; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you judge not, that you be not judged; condemn not, that you be not condemned. You owe a duty to the truth, every one of you; and by that duty that you owe to the truth, I was about to ſay, I charge you as before God; but I beſeech you as before God, ſtop the mouths of all them that ſhall either be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or ſpreaders of ſuch notorious lies: though it pleaſed God it were by a ſudden ſtroak of his hand; and how often hath he done it, when men have been worſe buſied? he was but ſeeking to work peace.</p>
               <p>Though it pleaſed God ſuddenly to take his ſpeech from him, yet I beſeech you know this withall, he was pleaſed not to take his life preſently away; nor his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding from him: from Thurſday about four of the clock that he was firſt ſtricken, he lived till Saturday night, or Sunday morning, I know not whether: but in this time on Friday night I was with him, and I perceived by the lifting up of his hand that he knew me; I put him in mind of ſome gracious promiſes that God hath made to us in Chriſt. I asked him whether he beleeved thoſe promiſes of God, and whether he found any comfort in thoſe promiſes, and then he lift up his hand. I asked him, and deſired him, if he found any aſſurance of Gods favour in Chriſt, to make the ſame ſigne; he lift up his hand again. I asked him if I ſhould pray with him; he deſired it, and at the period of every Petition, his hand went up to God. And one thing I obſerved more, that in one petition of mine, in that prayer for him, that it would pleaſe God to deliver him from the malice of Satan, that would be moſt buſie when we are weakeſt; he held up his hand higher then before, and continued holding it longer.</p>
               <p>And bleſſed be our good God, that we can hold and keep an intelligence with him, not only by ſpeech, but with our very hands: that lifting up of the hand, and thoſe groans of his ſpirit, I make no doubt, but they prevailed at the hands of God. And ſo as he lived, I make no queſtion but he died, a holy ſervant of God: and I hope his ſoul is now in heaven, and we are come to lay up his body in the earth, in the hope of a bleſſed, and joyful Reſurrection.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two main things to which the corrupt nature of man is ſubject and obnoxious; raſh judgement, and vain confidence; both ſpring out of one root, and that is Pride; where Pride poſſeſſeth the heart, it will make a man raſh in the judging of others, and preſume vainly, and confidently upon himſelf; At all theſe evils the Apoſtle ſtrikes here in this Chapter, both Mother and Daughter: both root and branch.</p>
               <p>To take heed of Pride, that is the Mother ſin; he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us to thankfulneſs: where inſtead of waxing proud of our ſelves, he would have us humble our ſelves; and he brings this argument to perſwade us, becauſe <hi>they that humble themſelves, God will exalt.</hi> The only way to be exalted, is to be humble; he compares the ſtate of man, (in reſpect of his future condition) to a pair of Balances that are hung on a beam, the lower the one balance is down, the higher the other is up; the lower we humble our ſelves in this life, the higher God will exalt us in the next.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:47453:153"/>The two main evils which are the branches of this root, the Apoſtle reproves in the eleventh Verſe. Firſt, raſh judging of others, the fault of thoſe that are apt to ſpeak evil of others; <hi>Speak not evil one of another,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. That that commonly we call the ſin of Detraction, <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, we are guilty of two wayes, either reporting of another that evill we ſhould not, or in not reporting of him that good we ſhould; in the one we offend, when we do either accuſe him of that ill that he is not guilty of at all, or aggravate againſt him that ill that he is guilty of, making it appear greater than it is; in the other we are guilty, when we do cut off all the good parts in a man, as if they were nothing at all, at leaſt when we extenuate that worth and goodneſs that is in him, making it appear leſs than it is.</p>
               <p>From this the Apoſtle diſſwades us by three Arguments; Firſt, becauſe they that do this, they do wrong the Law; <hi>He that ſpeaks evill of another, ſpeaks evill of the Law;</hi> for the Law would have us love. Secondly, they that do this, they do wrong God, they take Gods office out of his hands, when they take upon them to judge others: for he is the only Judge, and none elſe; for he is the only <hi>Law-giver,</hi> that is able to ſave us, and to deſtroy us. Thirdly and laſtly, they wrong their Brethren, when they cenſure and judge their Brethren beyond their Commiſſion, they take upon them more than they have Authority; as if he ſhould ſay, you exceed your Commiſſion in this, you take that upon you, that you have no warrant for: Thus againſt the raſh judging of others.</p>
               <p>Then againſt vain-confidence in our ſelves, this the Apoſtle ſtrikes at too: at a confidence out of which a man prefixeth unto himſelf, what he will do this day, and to morrow, what he will do this year, and the next year; what he will buy, and ſell, and gain. <hi>Go to now</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>you that ſay</hi> thus among your ſelves, <hi>to morrow you will go to ſuch a City, and tarry there a year, and buy and ſell, and get gain;</hi> This is a fooliſh confidence, and the Apoſtle endeavours to reprove, and ſuppreſs it,

               <p>His Correction is drawn, firſt from the ignorance of the perſons that make ſuch accounts as theſe; you ſay you will do thus and thus to morrow, you ſhew your ignorance; <hi>you know not what ſhall be to morrow.</hi> Secondly, by the uncertainty of the thing they reckon upon, then which nothing is more uncertain, nothing ſo uncertain as that is, therefore it is not to be reckoned upon; <hi>Conſider</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>what is your life;</hi> you talk of doing this and that to morrow; <hi>What is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little while, and then vaniſheth away.</hi>

               <p>His directing Argument is in the next verſe, where he teacheth us how we ſhould ſpeak of things future, and things preſent.</p>
               <p>Of things future, not to ſpeak too peremptorily of them, but with condition, <hi>If we live, and if God will.</hi> And then for things preſent, not to rejoyce boaſtingly in them, for <hi>there is nothing here to be boaſted of, or rejoyced in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thing that I have ſelected for this preſent time and occaſion to diſcourſe upon, is only that argument of the Apoſtle, wherein the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of our life is repreſented: the Apoſtle ſets it forth to us by way of Queſtion, and Anſwer; Firſt, he puts the Queſtion, <hi>What is your life?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, it is a thing not worthy the reckoning of; Build upon nothing to be done to morrow, upon ſo vain a foundation as that is: and to ſhew the uncertainty of our life, he comparatively deſcribes it, and ſets it forth, he ſaith, <hi>It is like a vapour that appeareth for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, and vaniſheth away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to the method that the Apoſtle hath laid down, ſo ſhall my Diſcourſe go on; and firſt I will ſay ſomething of the queſtion he layeth down: And then I will ſay ſomething of the words of the Text.</p>

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1.</note> to let us ſee what a poor uncertain thing we truſt to, when we build upon life, the Apoſtle throws out this queſtion, Your life, (ſaith he) <hi>What is your life?</hi> 
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:47453:153"/>Where firſt the Apoſtles phraſe he ſpeaks in is worthy to be obſerved, <hi>your life,</hi> not ours: <hi>yours</hi> that make ſuch accounts and reckonings as theſe, promiſe to your ſelves what you will do in following your worldly buſineſs, and increaſe your worldly gain; <hi>What is your life?</hi> The life of Worldlings the Apoſtle would ſecretly tax, as ſome Expoſiters collect, noting a difference and diſparity between Chriſtians in their wayes, and Worldlings in theirs; Worldlings are altogether for this Life, and the things of this Life, they never dream of any other to come; <hi>Post mortem nihil,</hi> &amp;c. as the Epicure in the Poet. Death that is an anihilation, and after death there comes nothing; Therefore all their projects and practices draw downwards, they project for a worldly Life, their buyings and ſellings, and markettings, and profits; theſe are the things they mind and ſeek after, all the thought of their hearts are bent upon theſe cares, all the dayes of their Lives are ſpent upon theſe things: but there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of Life that Chriſtians look for:
<note place="margin">Col. 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>There is a life hid with Chriſt in God;</hi> they know there is another Life to come after this, therefore their hearts are ſet upon other manner of objects. They are not ſuch as have their affections ſet upon the World, they make not account of themſelves as men of this World. <hi>Plato</hi> being asked the queſtion what Country-man he was, he ſaid, he was a Citizen of the World; a Chriſtian is not ſo, he is no Citizen of the World, but a Citizen of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>We have our converſation in Heaven, Phil.</hi> 3.10. The Greek word properly ſignifieth Citizens, or Burgeſſes; therefore Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Epitaph upon <hi>Neapotian</hi> renders it ſo; and <hi>Beza</hi> pertinent to the ſenſe, though not proper to the Text, We carry and behave our ſelves like Citizens, or Burgeſſes, or Free-men of Heaven; they have all their affections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all their thoughts and deſires bent that way: if they can obtain that, they have as much as they deſire to crown their wiſhes withall: they care for no other buying but of the truth; they fear not ſelling but of their Souls, they wiſh no gain but Heaven.</p>
               <p>And indeed this Life doth only deſerve to be called a Life: this Life which the Saints, which Chriſtians live: the Life that they live to God; and this Life is that that muſt prepare them for a better Life, the life in Heaven. Of any other Life but this, we may ask the queſtion in the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>What is it? what is it?</hi> It deſerves not ſo much as the name (as he ſaith) though in name it be a life, indeed it is a death; but pretermit the diſparity and difference between lives; ſome are comparatively, and other ſimply conſidered. The Life ſimply conſidered is the ſubject of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles queſtion, <hi>What is your life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſtions alway in the Scripture are emphatical, whether they tend to magnifie and advance, or to the villifying and abaſing of what they aim at; this here is moſt emphatical, to ſhew us how poor and baſe a thing Life is, like that queſtion in <hi>Job,</hi> to ſhew how poor and baſe a thing man is, <hi>Job</hi> 7.17. <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him, or ſetteſt thy heart upon him?</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 8.4. <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him, or the ſon of man, that thou deſireſt him?</hi> He ſhews how poor and baſe a thing man is: and he himſelf gives the anſwer to it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 114.6. <hi>Man is like to vanity?</hi> Nay, more plainly in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.6. <hi>Surely man is vanity;</hi> nay, <hi>ſurely</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>man in his beſt eſtate is altogether vanity.</hi> What could have been more emphatically ſpoken? there is not a word there but it hath its force; <hi>Man is vanity; Every man is vanity; Every man in his beſt eſtate is vanity; Every man in his beſt eſtate, is altogether vanity;</hi> and then there is a word of aſſeveration by which he ſeals and buckles up all; <hi>Surely, every man in his beſt eſtate, is altogether vanity.</hi> If the Apoſtle had but barely and nakedly ſaid what he had to ſay concerning the uncertainty and ſhortneſs of mans life, it had been ſufficient if he had ſaid thus: <hi>Your life is a vapour that appears for a little while,</hi> &amp;c. but he fetcheth it in with a <hi>Quere,</hi> he puts it to a queſtion, as if he would demur, and have us to pauſe and conſider of it, he brings it in with a, <hi>What is your life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Apoſtles leave we may be bold to quit another queſtion with him, what the Apoſtle means to expreſs it thus? Surely it is to inculcate that into us more through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to make us pauſe upon that more ſeriouſly: ſuch queſtious as theſe make a great ſtop in a mans way, as <hi>Amaza</hi>'s body in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.12. it ſtopped the paſſage <pb n="294" facs="tcp:47453:154"/>of the people, that they could not get forwards; ſo the interpoſing of ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe, make a ſtop in our wayes and proceedings; they make us take new thoughts and think again, they make us enter into new cogitations, whether it be better for us in that we are doing to perſiſt, or to break off.</p>

               <p>Is it honour that I am ambitious of? why what is our honour but a breath? a height that many are raiſed to, out of favour rather then deſert? like <hi>Phaetons</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, or <hi>Icarus</hi> Plumes, a Pinacle of honour, upon which he that ſtands muſt expect advancement, or ruin; to ſome it is a cloud of ſmoak, that the higher it mounts, the ſooner it dies.</p>
               <p>Is it riches that we ſet our hearts upon? let us ask the queſtion what is riches, but <hi>thick clay?</hi> as <hi>Habakuk</hi> tearms it, red and white earth, as <hi>Bernard</hi> faith, or the bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage of the earth, as another expreſſeth it; as baggage is to the Army, ſo is riches to men, it cannot well be left behind, but alwayes hinders the march, and ſometime loſeth the battel; in the getting of them there is a great deal of labour, in the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them a great deal of care, and in the foregoing of them, a great deal of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; a man may have them and not be happy, a man may want them, and yet be contented.</p>
               <p>Is it pleaſure, we are in love with, and dote upon? let us ask the queſtion, what is pleaſure? as a roſe ſenced with thorns, as a honey combe filled with ſtings; there is ſweetneſs you will ſay, but it is very dangerous; forward it caſts ſmiles, but back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it throwes darts; that joy is <hi>like the cracking of thorns;</hi> when it goes out, it is as the ſnuff of a candle, there is a great deal of bitterneſs, ſometimes in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joy we have.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, is it life we build upon? ask <hi>what is your life?</hi> the Text anſwers that, <hi>It is a vapour that appears for a little while, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> If we could thus ponder, and pauſe, with ſerious meditations upon thoſe worldly buſineſſes, that we ſo eagerly purſue; and put theſe queſtions to our ſelves in the purſuing of them; Beloved, they would peradventure help us ſo far to ſee into the vanity and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, as that the edge and heat of our deſires would be abated and pulled down.</p>
               <p>I have done with the Queſtion the Apoſtle propounds; <hi>What is your life?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I come to the words of the anſwer; <hi>It is even a vapour that appeareth,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of our life is ſet forth; in the deſcription of it obſerve two things;</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wherein it is compared to <hi>a vapour:</hi> In two things.</p>
               <p>The ſhortneſs of abiding.</p>
               <p>The ſuddenneſs of departing.</p>
               <p>Firſt the ſhortneſs of abiding, <hi>a vapour, that appeareth for a while.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where firſt obſerve, that the Apoſtle faith it <hi>appears</hi> only; he ſaith not it is, but it appeareth ſo; it rather <hi>appears,</hi> then is any matter of ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>And then this appearing is but ſhort, <hi>for a little while,</hi> it tarries not.</p>
               <p>And then the ſuddenneſs of the departure, as the abiding is but ſhort, ſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of it is ſudden, <hi>it is gone</hi> ere we are aware; and when it is gone, we know not what is become of it; there is not ſo much as any print or memory of it left.</p>
               <p>To what our life is compared,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 2.</note> that is the firſt point I am to ſpeak of, it ts compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>a vapour.</hi> If the Apoſtle had given no anſwer at all to the queſtion he puts, we might have imagined his meaning; and from other places of Scripture have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſupplyed it. How many times and places of Scripture ſets forth the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and uncertainty of our life, by ſundry ſimilitudes and compariſons? ſometimes it is compared to <hi>a dream,</hi> ſometimes to a <hi>ſpan,</hi> ſometimes to a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> ſometimes <pb n="295" facs="tcp:47453:154"/>to <hi>a weavers ſhuttle;</hi> ſometimes to <hi>a ſwift poſt;</hi> ſometimes to <hi>a ſhort race;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>a watch in the night;</hi> ſometimes to <hi>a flower in the field;</hi> ſometime to <hi>a tale that is told.</hi> All theſe are ſignificant expreſſions, to ſhew the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of life; ſo that from other places of Scripture we might anſwer the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles queſtion, though he had ſaid nothing; but his own anſwer expreſſeth it fitly and fully, by a pregnant, and pertinent reſembling it to <hi>a vapour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Philoſophers obſerve differences between vapours and exhalations, though both are drawn from the earth yet the matter of an exhalation is moiſt and hot; the matter of vapours moiſt and cold: Exhalations riſe from the ſuperficies of the earth; Vapours lie in the earth: exhalations continue longer, vapours ſhorter; but I need not ſtand upon Philoſophical diſtinctions, <hi>your life is a vapour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve how the reſemblance holds between the one and the other. Firſt, a vapour is nothing but a breath, therefore it is called ſo, of a word that ſignifieth, blowing or a breath, or nothing but ſmoak, therefore <hi>Act.</hi> 2. it is called <hi>a vapour of ſmoak;</hi> and ſuch is our life, <hi>a vapour,</hi> becauſe breath is nothing but <hi>the breath of life;</hi> So <hi>Moſes</hi> called it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. and when a man dies, it is ſaid <hi>his breath departs from him;</hi> Therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he brings it as an argument, to ſhew what a vain thing it is for a man to truſt upon one, that hath no more hold of his life then ſo; <hi>Ceaſe from man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils; what account is to be made of him, yea, it is even as ſmoak, his dayes paſs, and vaniſh away as ſmoak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>vapours</hi> are ingendered in the earth, and they lodge in the caverns, and hollow places of the earth; that is their manſion houſe, where they have their being, ſuch a <hi>vapour</hi> is our life; for this body of ours wherein our life is, it is a body of earth; <hi>Man hath his foundation in the duſt, Job</hi> 14. and there God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a receptacle and dwelling place, for our life to be received into, and contained; it is ſaid, when God gave it <hi>Adam</hi> firſt, <hi>he blew it into his noſtrils,</hi> there he made a lodging for it; therefore man is ſaid to have <hi>his breath in his noſtrils,</hi> in regard of which there is no truſt to be given to him, nor no account to be made of him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Vapours</hi> are drawn out of the earth by the Sun into the ayr, ſome to high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er regions then others are; yet when they are all at their higheſt, they have no fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor ſetling, but are carryed, and agitated, and toſſed by the winds, till at laſt they be diſſolved in ſhowers, and dewes, and fall back to the earth; ſo it is with our life, we come all at the firſt as vapours out of the earth, and there we have ſuns that draw us up, the favour of Princes peradventure, or great perſons, ſome to higher regions then others; ſome are drawn to high places of honour, but when they are there, they have no ſetling no fixing, as vapours in the ayr; they are hurried and toſſed, and carried to and fro, from one wind to another, and after a long and reſtleſs motion, at laſt they fall down to the earth again, out of which they were taken.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, where the earth exhales many <hi>vapours,</hi> the earth is not ſo pure and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as other places; for by experience we find the healthfulleſt places are in the hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly high Countries, but moariſh low grounds have leaſt health, and ſhorteſt lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>vapours;</hi> our life is a <hi>vapour</hi> in this reſpect; Many ill ayres continually exhaled in our corrupt natures, the world is full of inordinate concupiſence, and the Divel poyſons every place where he comes; ſo that while we live here, we live in a Moariſh ground, and full of ill <hi>vapours</hi> and ayr, and therefore the higher we climb the ſafer; as God faith to <hi>Lot</hi> in another caſe, when he bid him get him to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and there he ſhould be ſafe; ſo if we can get up to the Mountain, <hi>the mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the place and habitation for God, and his bleſſed Angels for ever, there we ſhall dwell in ſafety, for there are no foggs and miſts of temptations; there are no ill ayrs; there is nothing that favours of ſin or miſery, either to breed us anoyance, or threaten vexation; So you ſee the firſt thing what it is our life is reſembled unto, and how filthy the reſemblance holds.</p>

                     <hi>Obſervat.</hi>
                  </note> the Apoſtle uſeth the word of appearing, it is a thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in appearance than in deed; of ſhew rather than ſubſtance; ſuch is a <hi>Vapour,</hi> when it firſt ariſeth, and breaks out of the Earth, it makes a great ſwelling to the eye, as though it would fill the ayre, and darken the Sun, yet it hath no ſolidity nor ſubſtance with it, but it is a meer empty tumor; it ſeems and appears to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but really it is nothing; And ſuch is our life, it is rather a life in appearance than indeed; and therefore Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> knew not whether to call it a living death, or a dying life; for truly it is another manner of thing that deſerves to be called Life; only that deſerves to be called ſo by which the Soul lives to God, and by which the Soul lives hereafter with God; that is the life of the Soul, this is the life of the body; that is the life of Faith, <hi>The life that I live is by Faith in the Son of God;</hi> He calls not that life by which the body is united to the ſoul, but that he calls Life whereby the Soul is united to God; the Soul may be dead though the body be alive, if it be a ſtranger to the life of God, <hi>Dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> it may be <hi>dead while it lives,</hi> Eph. 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and a riſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</hi> He that lives in ſin is dead in ſin, and the Soul lives when the Body is dead; therefore that cannot be the true life by which the body breaths, but that by which the Soul ſubſiſts; if the Soul when it is ſeparate from the body may have happineſs, and live with God, that deſerves truly the name of life; but if it be a ſtranger to it, though it live, that Life is a dead life, nay the worſt death; the Scripture calls it the <hi>ſecond Death,</hi> where though we never die, yet we are ever dying: the Life that we live here, it is rather a thing in appearance than a being.</p>
               <p>So all theſe things that belong to this life, all the joyes, and all the ſorrows of it, they are rather appearing joyes, and appearing ſorrows, than true joyes, and true ſorrows.</p>
               <p>Conſider firſt the joyes of our Life, they are not ſound and true, but falſe and vain joyes, if any wicked or ill thing be the object of joy, as it is of too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they rejoyce in doing wickedly, that is a falſe joy, they rejoyce in that they ſhould ſorrow and mourn for: and not only wicked and unlawful, but worldly outward things, ſuch as we may rejoyce in, honours, pleaſures, riches, and friends; yet theſe being well examined, there is no ſolid true joy, but a vain joy in them, for they afford no rejoycing to the Soul; it is only matters of ſpiritual joy, the <hi>joy in the Holy Ghoſt</hi> that the Soul rejoyceth in, and with that joy the Soul is raviſhed, though it be bereft of other; as again, the Soul may be overcome with ſpiritual ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, though there be abundance of outward joy preſented to it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.14. our joyes are but appearing joyes.</p>
               <p>Conſider our ſorrows, and they are but appearing too, whether it be loſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that we ſorrow for, or ſenſe of pain, being rightly examined, we ſhall find that they be rather ſhews than true griefs, for there is nothing can bring true grief upon the Soul, but only the pain of ſin; nor no loſs can bring any true ſorrow upon the Soul, but the loſs of Gods favour: ſorrow beſtowed upon other things, it is but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſorrow in compariſon of this, therefore in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11. the Apoſtle faith, that the chaſtiſements that we ſuffer here, <hi>they ſeem grievous, and not joyous;</hi> they ſeem grievous, as if all that we ſuffered here were rather ſeeming than real; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Apoſtle ſaid right, for whatſoever chaſtiſement a man hath here, he may poſſible have more matter of joy than of ſorrow; to the ſame purpoſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. where he deſcribes the afflicted eſtate of the Saints (as God knows they are ſubject to many afflictions) he doth it with an, <hi>As it were,</hi> becauſe he would vilifie the terror of it, and not grant their condition ſo miſerable as it appears, <hi>as it were dying, as it were wanting, as it were ſorrowing;</hi> it is but as it were ſuch as they were not: ſo in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 29.8. the Prophet there tells us how it is with a hungry man, and with a thirſty man, <hi>when he dreams, he dreams he eats, and he dreams he drinks;</hi> But it is only the fancy of a dream, he finds it quite otherwiſe, he finds his ſtomack as empty as his hand, ſo it is with our life here, it is no better then a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dream; where we ſeem to do what is done, and we ſeem to be what we are: Saith the Poet, what is one, and what is another?

                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:47453:155"/>Thus you ſee that all that ever we have here, it is but only ſeeming, it is not real, whether they be our joyes, or our ſorrowes, they are but ſeeming joyes, and ſeeming ſorrows; yet again this appearing, and ſeeming life of ours <hi>it indures</hi> (faith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>but a little while.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>vapours</hi> laſt not long, for the firſt matter they are made of, affords not them any continuance; and beſides that, they are eaſily diſpelled and diſperſed by the Sun; ſuch a <hi>vapour</hi> is our life. Out of the ſame Argument you may ſee that our life can continue but for a while, it cannot laſt long.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is but a breath, as a <hi>vapour</hi> is. Again as <hi>vapours</hi> are apt to be diſperſed, and diſpelled eaſily by the hot Sun, and the cold wind, ſo hot and cold diſeaſes, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſort of other caſualties are eaſily apt to diſſipate it; it is true, ſome <hi>vapours</hi> hang longer in the ayr then others, ſo this <hi>vapour</hi> of life it may keep longer reſidence in ſome bodies then in others, but when it is longeſt, it is but a little while; <hi>David</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termins the date of it within the tearm of 80. years: the ſtrength and vigour of it in the opinion of the Philoſopher is of leſs continuance; the mind decayes at 45. years, and the body decayes at 35. If we compare the life of man with other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then we will ſay it is but <hi>a while:</hi> the Raven, the Elephant, the Stag, they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live man double and treble.</p>
               <p>If you compare it with the life of the world, then you will confeſs it is but a <hi>little while,</hi> for the world hath continued and laſted ſome thouſands of years, and there is not one man of ten thouſand that holds to a hundred.</p>
               <p>If we compare the continuance of this preſent age, to ages that are paſt, you will confeſs it is <hi>but a-while;</hi> in former ages men lived ſome two hundred, ſome four hundred, ſome five hundred, ſome nine hundred years; now, more die before ten, then after ſixty ſo that if once our life were ſaid to be but the <hi>breadth of a hand,</hi> now I may ſay our life is but a ſingers breadth.</p>
               <p>If we compare it with eternity, I am ſure you will ſay it <hi>laſts but a while;</hi> for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot be meaſured with any revolution of dayes, or months, or nights, or years; therefore in compariſon of that, the life of man is but a <hi>vapour,</hi> and <hi>a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour that endures for a little while.</hi> I need not inſiſt to prove this point, the truth of it is confirmed every day, I will only give you the uſe of it.</p>

And for our ſelves, ſince our life is <hi>but a while,</hi> let us be careful to do all the good we can, be ſtirring betimes, <hi>while we have opportunity, let us do good to all.</hi> It is the madneſs of the Epicures, becauſe they ſhall live but a while, they will live only to themſelves; <hi>Let us eat and drink, becauſe we ſhall die to morrow;</hi> and that is the reaſon; they die as beaſts, becauſe they care not to live as men. When they ſing out their firſt <hi>canto,</hi> we will fill our ſelves with pleaſure, the burden of the ſong muſt be, that <hi>we have wearied our ſelves with ſin.</hi> And it is the folly of the Mammoniſts, conſidering that they have not long to live, to put off the doing of all good till they die, whereas the rule of Chriſt is, <hi>to work while we have day, for ſhortly the night will come, when no man can work;</hi> They contrary put off all their work till night; all the day their charity ſleeps, and doth nothing; as one ſaid wittily, that that men give then they give of other bodies then their own, for they give that that they can keep no longer, and though it be ſaid to be given by their Will and Deed, it is rather their Deed then their Will, for if they could have their will, it ſhould never be their Deed, they would rather be poſſeſſors of it themſelves, then that others ſhould be their Executors, but be exhorted to do works of charity, and other good works, while you have time, while you may make your own eyes your overſeers, and your own hands your exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, while you have oppertunity do good to your ſelves, and others, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe you know not how long opportunity will be afforded, or took from you; <hi>For what is your life, it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little while.</hi>

                  <hi>It appears for a while, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> And here my diſcourſe muſt be like a <hi>vapour,</hi> ſhort, it ſuddenly vaniſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, that is the nature of a vapour, for as there is no matter to give it a fixed founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo when it appeareth for a little, it ſoon diſſolveth and vaniſheth away to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and ſuch a vapour is the life of man, it is gone ſuddenly, it is gone before we are aware, and when it is gone, there is no memory of it remains, no print of it; how ſuddenly and quickly, in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye have many been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, both of breath and life, as one would put out a candle, or tread out a ſnuff. It is true, ſickneſs is one common Bayliff that arreſts men at the ſuit of Death, but many a one hath been made the priſoner of Death, that was never arreſted at the ſuit of Death; yea know <hi>Abel</hi> was murthered in the field; <hi>Eli</hi> broak his neck from the chair; <hi>Abſalom</hi> was ſnatched up in an Oke; the diſobedient Prophet was ſlain by a Lyon; the diſobedient Prince was trodden to death in a crowd; <hi>Abimelech</hi> was ſlain by a peece of a milſtone; Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> was choaked with ſwallowing a flie; <hi>Pelus</hi> ſlain with a fall of a tile. Such is our life as a <hi>vapour,</hi> as the ſand of an hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, ever ſpending, and ever running out; as <hi>Gregory</hi> hath it in his Morals, Look how many dayes a man adds to his life, ſo many ſteps he takes to his death; So <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> to <hi>Heliodorus,</hi> we are ever dying, for we every day change; when I am writing this, all the points of my pen ſpends a point of my life; nay, while we are hearing this Sermon, we are paſſing on.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> and then I have done.</p>
               <p>Firſt, make the Uſe the Apoſtle doth to them that build upon futurity, and think they may do what they liſt; you that think you will do to day, and to morrow, <pb n="299" facs="tcp:47453:156"/>what you liſt. Oh, faith the Apoſtle, what reaſon have you to build on to day, and to morrow, when ye <hi>know not what a day will bring forth?</hi> We may not promiſe our ſelves life for to morrow, much leſs may we do as the fool in the Goſpel, promiſe years, when we cannot aſſure our ſelves of a moment of life, if we might aſſure our ſelves of a moment of life, in which it might be ſaid, it were impoſſible to die, we might poſſibly be immortal, and not die at all, but as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> faith, corruptible, is not ſo capable of incorruption, but ſince it hath been ſubject to fall, till it doth fall, it is ever declining; there is no building nor truſting to uncertain futurity, we muſt not reſt, and truſt on thoſe things which are to come, but only upon God, and ſpeak conditionally of them, not abſolutely; refer the ſucceſs and diſpoſing of all things to come, to the will and good pleaſure of God, remembring what our life is, ſo make leſs accompt of our life, and of our ſelves and all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing our life is ſo vaniſhing, let us ever prepare for death, for ſudden death, becauſe life is vaniſhing; <hi>Thou knoweſt not in what hour thy maſter will come;</hi> Therefore every hour we ſhould ſo beſtow our ſelves, that our Maſter may find us at work.</p>
               <p>For this, two things are requiſite;</p>
               <p>Firſt, ever think of death, death cannot be ſudden to that man, that ever thinks of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, be careful to lead a godly life; the goodneſs of the life conſiſts not in the long continuance of it, but in the well imploying of it, it may be any mans caſe to live well, it can be no mans to live long; our comfort is, though our life be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, yet notwithſtanding this very moment of time, is enough to gain to us here-after eternity, and how much better is a ſhort time well ſpent, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of eternal happineſs, then a ſhort time ill ſpent, for the purchaſing of eternal miſery? your life is momentary, yet eternity depends on it, if it be ſpent ill, eternal miſery, if well we are eternally happy: howſoever here we vaniſh as a <hi>vapour;</hi> yet one day we ſhall become as fixed ſtarrs in the right hand of Chriſt, we ſhall ſhine as ſtarrs for ever.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewed how the life of man is compared <hi>to a vapour that appears for a little while, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> Beloved, I pray let not this Sermon paſs as a <hi>vapour,</hi> let not all of it paſs away, in the found you here, <hi>but fix it as a nail in a ſure place,</hi> in your underſtanding, in your memory, in your affections; and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how ſhort and ſudden every mans end and life is, or may be; <hi>O that my people were wiſe, they would underſtand this, they would conſider their latter end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have a ſpectacle here before us, that was a real comment upon this Text; She did underſtand the Doctrine of it, and was excellent in the practice of it; A Gentlewoman that deſerved a better Orator to commemorate the vertues that were in her, and to give her praiſes due; it had been a fitter work for your reverend and worthy Miniſter, whoſe abſence at this time I ſupply, he could have ſpoken more fully of her then I can, becauſe he was acquainted longer with her then I was; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a part of my unhappineſs, that I knew her ſo little a while, and peradventure you will ſay it is a part of her unhappineſs, that this office is done by one that knew her ſo little a while; It is true indeed, I am not able to ſay much of her, for my knowledge of her was but a few weeks or months, by reaſon of our neighbour-hood in the Country, but then I obſerved her to be one of the ornaments of her ſex, and every thing that came from her was graceful and comely; the ſweetneſs of nature and grace, in my opinion concurred in her; But I muſt deliver the moſt that I have to ſay, from the report that I have from others, yet from very good hands. <hi>Solomon</hi> faith, <hi>A good name, is as a good oyntment poured forth,</hi> like the precious Alablaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box that <hi>Mary</hi> broke on the head of our Saviour, the ſmell of it perfumed all the houſe; I may ſay of her, as the Apoſtle faith of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> She was well reported of by all, and I am perſwaded ſhe was reported well of the truth it ſelf, ſhe had a name anſwerable to her vertues; <hi>Solomon</hi> faith, <hi>A prudent wife,</hi> or a good wife, <hi>is the gift of God;</hi> ſhe was a <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> that was her name, <hi>The gift of God;</hi> and a gift God beſtowed to the comfort of him that had her.</p>
               <p>She was conſtant both in the performance of publike duties and private, in hearing Gods word, not only on the Lords day, but (as occaſion gave leave) on the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, <pb n="300" facs="tcp:47453:157"/>and ſhe was not only conſtant at good exerciſes abroad, but (which was the crown of her commendations) ſhe was ſo at home alſo, ſhe was conſtant in reading the Word; I am credibly informed, that ſhe read over the Bible ſeven times in the ſeven years that ſhe was married; ſhe conſtantly made uſe of that ſhe heard, I my ſelf ſaw no leſs then two quires of paper writ out with her own hand, collected part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of other books, out principally out of Sermons, not noted at Church, when ſhe heard them, but when ſhe came home, being in this like <hi>Mary</hi> that laied up the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt in her heart; her daily ſpending of her time was commendable, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary; in the morning up to prayer with her family, and then unto private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by her ſelf: from prayer to reading, and then to work; and then to prayer, and to dinner, and then to work; this was her continual courſe of life without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. She was a <hi>Sarah</hi> for obedience, <hi>Rebecca</hi> for wiſedome, <hi>Mary</hi> for piety, <hi>Martha</hi> for houſwifery, a true <hi>Lydea,</hi> ſhe heard, and God opened her heart, that ſhe attended to thoſe things ſhe heard. A true <hi>Dorcas,</hi> full of good works; they that knew her, knew her (ſo far as wiſedome and diſcretion dictated to her) full of charity, of good works, and almes-deeds. But her <hi>life was a vapour that appeared for a little while, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> She verified my Text too truly, in that it pleaſed God ſuddenly to call her, even in the prime and ſtrength of her years, ſhe was but a young woman, and ſhe dyed in Child-bed.</p>
               <p>You that are Child-bearing women, I wiſh you to ſet this pattern and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before your eyes, and learn by this ſpectacle to ſee how neer you walk to the brink of your grave, when you come to be delivered of child; I wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the way, that any ſhould find fault with that ſolemn thankſ-giving, that is appointed by the Church to be rendred to God for women, for his preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them from the great danger of Child-birth; there is but a ſtep between you and death, you ſhould then have a care to prepare for your death; I ſee a great deal of time ſpent to prepare all brave and fine. God may quickly turn all your chambers, and hang them with black, and turn your jollity into mourning; therefore you ſhall rather prepare for your winding-ſheet, and for your grave; for undoubtedly ſhe did ſo: and I may in ſome ſence apply that litterally of the Apoſtle to her; In bearing of children ſhe is ſaved. It is true, the Apoſtle gives that as an argument of comfort to women, becauſe before he had preached obedience to them, a doctrin that they do not well reliſh, yet he gives two reaſons, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was firſt made, and ſhe firſt ſinned, that is another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet leſt ſhe ſhould be too much diſcouraged with that of the Apoſtle, and becauſe the pain of child-bearing was threatned to women for a part of their curſe; the Apoſtle adds that as a comfort; <hi>In bearing of children they ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Notwithſtanding the pain and ſorrow of child-bearing was inflicted as a puniſhment upon them, yet under that curſe there is a way of ſalvation open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if they be ſuch women, ſaith the Apoſtle, as, <hi>continue in faith and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with holineſs and ſobriety.</hi> Theſe vertues being eminent in this dear Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſiſter of ours, no doubt but in bearing of children ſhe is ſaved; that is, ſhe found under that curſe, a way to a bleſſing, an everlaſting bleſſing of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>How ſhe diſpoſed her ſelf in the time of her ſickneſs; thoſe of the family well know; truly I have not oft, ſcarſe ever heard of a woman of her rank and quality, (for ſhe was a woman well deſcended, and well bred,) and yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of a woman more beloved, and more bewayled: her Husband com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of his loſs, never man loſt a better wife; all the ſervants, never any had a better Miſtriſs; and all the neighbours, never any had a better neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Concerning her in the time of her ſickneſs, they can give a better, and more particular teſtimony then I; I only did one office and ſervice to her, when in the abſence of your reverend Paſtor, I was called, I viſited her an hour or two before ſhe went, when (God knowes) ſhe was faint and weak, and able to breath but a few words, but they were ſweet; I told her, I hoped, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, but that as ſhe had made a Chriſtian profeſſion in her life time, ſo now ſhe would ſeal it up: ſhe anſwered; <hi>I have endeavoured to ſerve God, but <pb n="301" facs="tcp:47453:157"/>with a great deal of infirmity and weakneſs, I reſt not upon that, I reſt upon my evidence, and there is my comfort; I doubt not, but he that hath given me the evidence, will alſo give me the inheritance.</hi> I think theſe were the laſt words ſhe ſpake.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhe is gone to her reſt, her body to reſt, as <hi>a priſoner of hope,</hi> till the Reſurrection, her ſoul reſts in the arms of God; I have no more to ſay to her, or of her, then that Chriſt ſaid to the woman in the Goſpel; <hi>Woman, go in peace, thy faith hath ſaved thee.</hi>

               <p>Natural <hi>ſleep</hi> is that ſpoken of,
<note place="margin">1. Natural. Pſal. 3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.5. <hi>I will lay my ſelf down to ſleep, and riſe again.</hi> This natural <hi>ſleep</hi> is the reſt, and reſtitution of nature.</p>
               <p>Moral <hi>ſleep,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Moral. Dan. 12 2. Act. 7. ult.</note> is natural death; this is the death, and diſſolution of nature, of which the Scripture ſpeaketh, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>They that ſleep in the duſt, ſhall riſe again.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 7. ult. <hi>When Steven had ſpoken theſe words, he fell aſleep;</hi> that is, he died.</p>
               <p>Spiritual <hi>ſleep,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Spiritual, compared to ſleep.</note> it is the ſleep of ſin, and ſecurity: this is the death and privation of grace in the ſoul; as the other is the privation of life in the body: of this our Text ſpeaketh; <hi>It is time to ariſe, or awake out of this ſleep;</hi> the <hi>ſleep</hi> of ſin, and ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Now the ſtate of ſin and ſecurity, is compared here to the ſtate of <hi>ſleep,</hi> becauſe there are many reſemblances and likeneſſes between the ſtate of a ſinner, and a ſleepy man: for what effect ſleep hath in the body, the ſame effect hath the ſleep of ſin in the ſoul. I will ſhew it you in a few inſtances, and ſo paſs it.</p>
               <p>Firſt;
<note place="margin">1. For the time, the night.</note> 
                  <hi>They that ſleep</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſleep in the night.</hi> The ſame that the Apoſtle aims at here; <hi>It is time to awake out of ſleep:</hi> becauſe <hi>the night is paſt.</hi> The night is a time to ſleep in. So, thoſe that ſleep in ſin, it is becauſe they are in the night of ſin, there is a darkneſs, the Canopy is ſpread over them, the Sun of grace, and the day of ſalvation ſhines not upon them: their eyes are cloſed up in darkneſs, as it is with a ſleepy man.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2. Expoſed to danger.</note> when a man goes to ſleep, he puts off his cloaths; he lies naked, expoſed to all dangers. And when a man is in the ſleep of ſin and ſecurity, he wants his garments, to be cloathed with Chriſts righteouſneſs and holineſs: he lies naked, expoſed, and open to all Gods diſpleaſure, and all the arrowes of Gods wrath. So in <hi>Deut.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ut. 32.</note> 32. when the Iſraelites, the people of God, had made a Calfe, <hi>Moſes</hi> came and ſaw them <hi>naked;</hi> that is, deſtitute of Gods protection, and wanting that garment, that armour of proof, that righteouſneſs that before they had upon them.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">3. Willingneſs.</note> a man naturally layes himſelf down willingly to ſleep, he is willing to take his reſt. So it is in the ſleep of ſin, every natural man is willing to lay himſelf down to ſleep in ſin, to take his eaſe, and reſt in ſin; for <hi>there is no man but hath free will to ſin, though no man bath free will to good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again,
<note place="margin">4. Suddenneſs.</note> as ſleep it ſurprizeth a man ſuddenly oft-times before he is aware, or before he can remember himſelf where he is, or what he is doing: ſo the ſleep of ſin, it oft ſurprizeth a man before he is aware. As we ſee in the Diſciples of Chriſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<note place="margin">Mar. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. bodily ſleep ſurprized them, even then when they intended to watch; <pb n="305" facs="tcp:47453:159"/>and when Chriſt appointed them to watch: but the ſleep of their minds and ſouls was much more: for that was not a time to ſleep, if they had known what they had been about.</p>
               <p>Again further,
<note place="margin">5 Inſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movableneſs.</note> as the ſleep of the body binds up the ſenſes, and makes a man ſenſleſs of that which is good or evil: he that ſleeps, offer him a Kingdom, it moves him not: threaten him, draw a ſword, offer a ſtab him, he ſtirrs not, he is not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; he is unmoveable: a man that is aſleep, where you left him, there you ſhall find him ſtill. So it is in the ſleep of ſin, it binds up all the ſpiritual ſenſes, that a man that is in this ſleep, he wants a ſeeing eye, and a hearing ear, he knows nothing, he ſees nothing of God, (but that which will make him in-excuſable:) he taſtes not, he feels not how good God is to him. Offer him the kingdom of heaven, and grace in the means; it moves him not: threaten him, draw out the ſword, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Gods wrath againſt him, he fears nothing. As he is inſenſible in theſe courſes, ſo he is immovable, look where he was at the firſt, there ſhall you find him ſtill, there is no difference: but he is as a dead man, as long as he ſleeps thus in ſin.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point:
<note place="margin">6 Vain fancies.</note> ſixtly, the ſleep of the body deludes a man with many vain dreams, and fooliſh conceits, falſe joyes, and falſe fears, and falſe hopes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are nothing true. So the ſleep of ſin in the ſoul, it hath the ſame effect, it feeds a man up with falſe joyes, and falſe hopes: it caſts him down with falſe fear, where no fear is. A man in the ſtate of ſin, he fears the face of man, the eye of man, the word of man, the hand of man: he fears not the eye of God, nor the word of God, nor the mighty power of God. So likewiſe for falſe joyes, a man that is a beggar, he dreams that he hath gold enough, that he tumbles in it. So beggars in grace, thoſe that have not a rag of righteouſneſs upon them, they dream that they <hi>are rich, and encreaſed in goods, and that they have need of nothing, when they know not that they are poor and beggarly, and naked,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> So this ſpiritual ſleep, it fils a man with falſe conceits.</p>
               <p>A man ſometime when he goes to ſleep,
<note place="margin">7 The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</note> he thinks not to ſleep long, but to take a nap, and wake by and by, yet it may be he ſleeps beyond his compaſs, ſometime he wakes no more: So, it is with a man in ſin, he hopes to wake, he thinks to ſleep but a little, but ſometime he ſleeps long, and ſometime he never wakes. So we ſee how aptly the ſpirit compares the ſtate of a man in ſin to ſleep. This is the firſt thing in the meaning of the words.</p>
               <p>Now the ſecond thing is,
<note place="margin">2 What meant by waking.</note> what is meant by <hi>waking,</hi> or <hi>ariſing</hi> out of ſleep. To <hi>wake,</hi> or to <hi>riſe out of ſleep,</hi> is for a man to do in the matter of Chriſtianity, as a man that awakes out of ſleep. And for a man that wakes out of ſleep, there are three things he doth, and ſo out of the ſleep of ſin.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 To open the eyes to ſee the light.</note> there muſt be an opening of the eyes, and a beholding of the light. And this is the firſt thing in awaking out of the ſleep of ſin and ſecurity: a man muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to open his eyes, to behold the light of Gods word, and that ſhining grace that the Lord propounds to him in the Scriptures: he muſt open his eyes to behold the light; and that will diſcover ſuch objects as will keep him awake. Therefore men ſleep ſo much in the night, becauſe they are in the dark, and not in the light; they ſee objects in the day time that keeps them awake. So for this ſleep of ſin, if we would keep awake, let us open our eyes to behold the light of grace; and in the light of the Scriptures we ſhall ſee objects that will help to keep us waking: we ſhall ſee Gods diſpleaſure, the wrath of God, we ſhall ſee thoſe things, that <hi>eye cannot ſee, nor ear hear, nor hath entred into the heart of man.</hi> We ſhall ſee them in their beginning and degrees; though the full degree cannot enter into the heart to conceive, and this will help to keep us waking.</p>
               <p>Then in the next place when a man hath opened his eyes to ſee the light,
<note place="margin">2 To rouze the ſenſes.</note> then there muſt be a rouzing of the ſenſes. This awakes a man, when his ſenſes that were bound up by ſleep are looſed, that now he is able to ſee, and to move, and to talk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What unbinds the ſpiritual ſenſes of a man in this ſleep of ſin? only faith in the Son of God, that opens the eyes of them that were dead in ſin; it reſtore; new ſenſes, and life, that they are able to walk in the wayes of God, and to move in the <pb n="306" facs="tcp:47453:160"/>actions of godlineſs and Chriſtianity. Therefore the ſecond thing that a man muſt doe to awake himſelf out of ſleep, is to get faith in his ſoul, that he may ſuck vertue from Chriſt, and to get his ſenſes loofed that he may ſee, and taſte, and feel the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, which without Chriſt he cannot attain.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3. Get out of bed.</note> and laſtly, a man muſt get out of his bed, to awake him out of ſleep, when his eyes are open and his ſenſes looſed, leap out of the bed; that is by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: this is <hi>to ceaſe to do evil.</hi> Therefore when the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>to riſe out of ſleep,</hi> theſe are the three main things the Apoſtle aims at, wherein he expreſſeth it plentifully. Firſt, to get the true knowledge of God, to ſee thoſe objects that may allure, and draw our minds. And then labour to get faith in the Son of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our ſenſes may be unbound. And then to get out of the bed of ſin by repentance, <hi>to ceaſe to do evil, and learn to well:</hi> this is to awake out of the bed of ſleep.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 Who muſt awake.</note> who they are that muſt <hi>ariſe out of ſleep?</hi> Every man: for ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle plainly expreſſeth it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt,</hi> whoſoever thou art that ſleepeſt, awake, and riſe out of ſleep.</p>
               <p>But who are they that ſleep?</p>
               <p>Two ſorts of men:
<note place="margin">Queſt. Anſw.</note> all ſorts of men may be reduced to two heads;
<list>
                     <item>The Natural Man.</item>
                     <item>The Regenerate Man.</item>
                  </list>
And both ſleep.</p>
               <p>The natural man is in a faſt,
<note place="margin">1 The natural man.</note> dead ſleep; you ſhall as ſoon get a <hi>rib out of his ſide;</hi> (as God did out of <hi>Adam, when he was aſleep</hi>) as wake him. You ſhall ſooner <hi>drive a nail into his temples,</hi> as <hi>Jael</hi> did to <hi>Siſera,</hi> then awake him. He is in a faſt dead ſleep, <hi>in the ſleep of death:</hi> as a man in a Lethargy that never wakes again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this man had need to ariſe, to be called upon, and to be rouzed out of <hi>the ſleep of death: Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ſtand up from the dead, that Chriſt may give thee light;</hi> Ariſe as a man ariſeth out of the Grave, out of the bed of ſleep. This is the man that is in a dead ſleep.</p>
               <p>But not only theſe are in a dead ſleep,
<note place="margin">2 The regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> but the regenerate alſo are in a ſleep, and they keep not themſelves ſo waking, and ſo watchful, as they ought to do: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle applies it to himſelf, and to all the Saints; <hi>It is time for us to awake out of ſleep.</hi> He puts himſelf in the number: For he that is moſt wakeful had need to be more, and to riſe out of ſleep ſtill. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. It is the voyce of the Church; <hi>I ſleep but my heart waketh.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 5.2.</note> Even the Church her ſelf that was waked already in part, in a great part: yet ſhe confeſſed that ſhe ſlept. Her ſleep was not ſo dead, and ſo faſt as formerly, yet ſhe ſlept, and ſlumbred; <hi>I ſleep but my heart waketh.</hi> It was not a hearty,
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> a dead ſleep as the other was. So in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. it is ſaid of the <hi>wiſe virgins,</hi> as well as of the <hi>fooliſh, they all ſlumbred and ſlept.</hi> The <hi>fooliſh</hi> ſlept; that is, they were faſt aſleep: the <hi>wiſe virgins</hi> they <hi>ſlumbred.</hi> And ſo the Diſciples themſelves, by the ſide of our Lord, even when a temptation was neer, and the tempter was upon them, they fell faſt aſleep, and were not able to <hi>watch</hi> with Chriſt, no, <hi>not one hour,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee (brethren) that thoſe alſo that are Regenerate, thoſe that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the greateſt meaſure of grace, and are in the higheſt form in grace (for who was higher then Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) they themſelves have need to be called out of ſleep; <hi>It is time for them to awake out of ſleep,</hi> though they be waking perſons: even thoſe that have received grace to beleeve, and obey, and be watchful in ſome meaſure, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven theſe muſt be called out of ſleep.</p>
               <p>Therefore in <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.2.
<note place="margin">Rev. 3.2.</note> It is the counſel that is given to the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> that had received ſome grace, and was in ſome meaſure watchful: ſaith the holy Ghoſt to that Church; <hi>Be awake, and ſtrengthen the things that are ready to die.</hi> He tels them in the words before, <hi>Thou haſt a name to live, but art dead;</hi> that is, thou art even almoſt dead, there is a little life of grace in thee, thou art almoſt dead: for ſo it is explained in the words following: <hi>awake and ſtrengthen the things that <pb n="307" facs="tcp:47453:160"/>are ready to die.</hi> Thus we ſee the difference between the calling of the wicked, and the godly in their ſleep. The one is called from ſleep, <hi>to ſtand up from the daad:</hi> the other <hi>to ſtreng then the things that are ready to die.</hi> And thus we ſee the perſons who muſt wake.</p>
               <p>In the next place,
<note place="margin">4. Why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that are aſleep.</note> Why doth the Apoſtle call upon ſleepers <hi>to awake out of ſleep?</hi> We ſee natural men, are as dead men, in a dead ſleep, he doth but loſe his labour, and ſpend his breath, they cannot hear and underſtand. And the godly likewiſe, it is with them as with a man in a ſleep, they are drowſie, and do not much intend what is ſpoken.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer briefly;
<note place="margin">Exhortations not in vain.</note> Exhortations in Scripture are never in vain, fall where they will.</p>
               <p>This voyce of exhortation,
<note place="margin">1 To the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> if it come upon regenerate men that are awake in part, it is a means to awake them more: it is a means to keep them awake, as it was a means to awake them at the firſt.</p>
               <p>If it fall upon wicked men that are in a dead ſleep,
<note place="margin">2 To the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> it ſerves (if not to awake them, yet,) to convince them, to make them inexcuſable: for ſuch a man might object, What is this to me? I am called on to awake, I am in a dead ſleep; can I hear if I be in a dead ſleep? But know this, thou that art in a dead ſleep, that art not able to hear, thou art not able to hear, becauſe thou haſt caſt thy ſelf into a dead ſleep. For this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Suppoſe a man in the night ſeaſon be in his firſt ſleep, tell him a meſſage from God, what he would have him to do; he underſtands it not, he knows it not: it is no ſin of his, becauſe he is a-ſleep: becauſe God hath ordained this ſleep to be due to nature. But it is not ſo in the ſleep of ſin, God doth not caſt a man into the ſleep of ſin; but man himſelf, and the divel: therefore if thou have caſt thy ſelf into this ſleep, that thou know not what God would have done; it is thy ſin, and ſhall be thy damnation: look to it. The exhortations and precepts fall not in vain, <hi>as the rain returns not in vain,</hi> either they awake a man more that was awake before; or they convince him that is not awake: becauſe he is fallen a ſleep by his own ſin, and the malice of the divel. To come therefore to the Uſe, and Applicacion.</p>
               <p>The point thus opened,
<note place="margin">The dead ſleep of the world.</note> leads us to the conſideration of that woful ſleep that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the world.</p>
               <p>And then to conſider the ſleep that oppreſſeth the Church of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to conſider the ſleep of the wicked and unregenerate, thoſe that are in the dead ſleep of ſin. Even as the Prophet obſerved in his time, ſo now who doth not ſee <hi>all the world at reſt and at peace?</hi> like <hi>Lachiſh</hi> that ſecure people; a dead people, crying <hi>peace, peace, to themſelves,</hi> and fearing nothing till they be awaked; there is nothing but ſecurity. To ſhew this in ſome particular inſtances, what a number of perſons be caſt into the dead ſleep of ſin.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all Idolaters,
<note place="margin">1. Idolaters.</note> whereof there are a numerous generation every where; they are faſt aſleep in the bed and boſome of that whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that hath inchanted, and bewitched them with the <hi>cup of her fornication.</hi> They have laid themſelves down to take a nap upon her lap, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did upon <hi>Dalilahs,</hi> till they loſe their <hi>locks,</hi> and their life as he did: and all the means that GOD hath uſed a long time: all the light of grace, the light of knowledge; all the miniſtry that hath been ſo powerful and ſo plentiful, cannot pull them out of her lap: but the Lord hath threatned, not only <hi>Jezahel</hi> that whore and ſtrumpet, (by which he means, that whore of <hi>Rome</hi>) but all thoſe that <hi>commit fornication with her,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>to caſt them into a bed of ſorrow;</hi> he will caſt them upon a bed of little eaſe; and he will <hi>ſlay her children:</hi> The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this fearful ſleep ſhall be death. Even as <hi>Siſera</hi> when he ſlept, the <hi>nail was driven into his temples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe a generation of unclean adulterers,
<note place="margin">2. Adulterers.</note> they are aſleep upon the foul bed of voluptuouſneſs, and uncleanneſs; blow a trumpet in their ears, ring a peal of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance againſt them, that is able to make the ſtones quake, and the rocks to break a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder; tell them that <hi>whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</hi> Nay, let the world ring a peal of infamy, and ſhame upon them, follow them with infamy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches for their ſin, yet all this awakes them not: they will ſcarce open their eyes, except it be in the <hi>twilight,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, a little to wait at their neighbours door <pb n="308" facs="tcp:47453:161"/>for his wife or his daughter; till the Lord alſo caſt them upon the bed of ſhame, and ſorrow, and ſcorn, and curſe, from which they ſhall never riſe. It is a lamentable thing that a mans conſcience hearing this, ſhould not apply this to his heart, that he ſhould dare to ſhut his eyes, and dare ſtill to caſt himſelf on his bed, not thinking what will be the iſſue of it.</p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe,
<note place="margin">3: Drunkards.</note> a monſtrous generation of Drunkards, monſters in nature, for no unreaſonable creature ſo much extinguiſheth the gifts of nature as they. Theſe caſt themſelves upon the bed of vomiting, and filth, that no covering is large enough to hide their ſhame. Let a man ſpeak to them, and adviſe and counſel them; there is no hearing of him in their cups, as <hi>Abigail</hi> obſerved in her husband <hi>Nabal.</hi> Nay, let God ſpeak to them, and pinch them in their bodies, in their ſtrength, in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates:
<note place="margin">Prov: 23.</note> let the Lord make them feel the ſmart; be their dangers never ſo neer as <hi>Solomon</hi> deſcribes them notably in <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. a drunken man <hi>is as he that ſleeps on the top of a Maſt, in the middeſt of the Sea,</hi> in moſt extream perill, yet, ſaith he <hi>they have ſmitten me, but I felt it not; they have beaten me, but I diſcerned it not;</hi> therefore <hi>when he wakes, he will follow</hi> his cups ſtill.</p>
               <p>The like we may ſay of a number of Sabbath-breakers,
<note place="margin">4: Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers.</note> that caſt themſelves upon the bed of prophaneneſs, and Atheiſme: ſometimes for form, and faſhion, they will come to the Temple perhaps, and liſten a little to the word ſpoken: but preſently you ſhall ſee and obſerve them, that they caſt themſelves faſt aſleep, as <hi>Eutichus, when at midnight Paul was preaching, he falls from the loft, and his life was gone from him.</hi> But there is this difference, that was at midnight, theſe will do it at mid-day. So little have men gained of inſtruction, and of the knowledge, of the fear of God; of all that they have heard, that they can ſcarſe keep their eyes, and their ears open, a quarter of the exerciſe, to hear what God ſaith to them for their own good.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſpeak of thoſe unjuſt,
<note place="margin">5: Oppreſſors.</note> injurious, uſurious perſons, whoſe jawes are as knives to cut thoſe that they deal with? thoſe that uſe injuſtice in their weights, in their wares, in their lights; that uſe any manner of deceit for the defrauding of their brethren. And theſe caſt themſelves upon the bed of their miſchief, and ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their preſent unjuſt gains, in getting unjuſt riches.</p>
               <p>Let a man ſpeak to theſe, and tell them their eſtate out of the Scriptures; alas they hear not; deal with them, as we deal with men in a ſwoon; rub them, and chafe them, and if that will not ſerve the turn, pinch them, prick them, and wring them, and make them ſmart, if it be poſſible to make them feel: alas, ſuch a man dies in our hands, there is no life to be got in him. All that we can get from ſuch a wretch for our love to him, and our teſtimony of him, it is ſome bruſh or blow. This ſenſleſs man layes about him, he knows not upon whom.</p>
               <p>In one word,
<note place="margin">6: Security.</note> when I conſider the ſecure courſe of a multitude of men amongſt whom we live: it ſeems as if they had found that Cave of ſleep which the Poets fain, and ſpeak of, a place very fit for theſe perſons. A Cave of ſleep, as they deſcribe it, where never Sun ſhines: a place far remote from all company: a place where the houſes have no doors for fear the hindges ſhould wake them: a place where they ſuffer no cocks, nor clocks, nor nothing that may hinder them from ſleep. And the Generation of men that I ſpeak of, they ſeem to deſcend from <hi>Severats,</hi> a kind of people that are looſe, and lazie, and ſleepy, and laſcivious, that will not endure any Clocks, or any artificers that uſe tools and hammers to knock, that they ſhould not trouble them.</p>
               <p>But why do you ſpeak theſe words they ſeem ſtrange to us?</p>
               <p>But yet truly, your ſelves ſhall ſay they be true in the Application.</p>
               <p>For firſt, do we not ſee moſt men in general, (except ſome few whom the Lord hath taken into his own teaching,) that they cannot abide the place of the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, the place where the Sun of the light of grace ſhines, they remove themſelves from it, they abſent themſelves upon any occaſion, as if a man ſhould ſet himſelf to run from the light of the Sun.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe do we not ſee that men cannot abide the ſociety of godly men, of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men fearing God, that deal truly with them in exhortations, and admonitions, and loving rebukes, &amp;c. They will none of this. So do we not ſee how ready, and <pb n="309" facs="tcp:47453:161"/>willing natural men are to chaſe away, (if it were poſſible) all the Lords Cocks, and all his ſervants, that they might not cry againſt their ſins, that they might not awaken them, nor come neer them. They are ſet ſo faſt aſleep, that they cannot abide any ſervant of God. And for the miniſtery of the Law, which <hi>Jeremie</hi> calls, as <hi>a Hammer to break the hard heart,</hi> and to knock, and rap the ſleepy ſoul, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable thing; they cannot endure this hammer; they cannot abide theſe doggs that bark againſt their ſins: whereas <hi>dumb doggs that can neither bark,</hi> nor bite, thoſe they can like well enough. Somewhat they would have, they are content with a formal faſhion: but theſe men that ſpeak againſt their ſins, that diſcover their eſtate in ſin; theſe they cannot endure. Now tell me if theſe men live not in a carnal ſleep? and are found in the Cell, and Cave of darkneſs, wherein they deſire to ſleep for ever?</p>
               <p>To come from theſe,
<note place="margin">The ſleep of the Church.</note> in the ſecond place let us conſider, that not only theſe natural men, and worldlings, are caſt into a dead ſleep; but would not a man marvel, that even Chriſtians ſhould ſometimes be caſt a ſleep? Would not a man wonder that the Diſciples of Chriſt that were ſo neer to the ſide of their Maſter, that were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Maſters exhortation in the former Precept that he taught them, that were ſo neer temptation, that the yoak was even upon their neks; would not one think it a wonder, that they ſhould <hi>not watch one hour</hi> with Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Therefore Brethren, let us take notice of our ſecurity much more, that are infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behind the Diſciples in grace: let us rate our ſelves for the heavineſs, and dulneſs of our hearts.</p>
               <p>But becauſe we are Baptized, and hear Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we can make no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that he is aſleep.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us try, and conſider, whether thoſe that hear the Word, and are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the life of grace; thoſe that are already awakened, be not in ſuch a fearful ſlumber, as may well be called aſleep.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all therefore,
<note place="margin">Signs of ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Chriſtians.</note> this is one mark of a man that is aſleep, he hears not, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not the things that are ſpoken to him:
<note place="margin">1: Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> ſo it is a mark of a ſleepy heart and conſcience, when a man hears not, nor underſtands the word that he doth hear: when he hears not that which is ſpoken. It is one Judgement upon wicked men, the Book of God is claſped to them: ſuch a man reads and hears, and diſcerns not. If the Book be open, his heart is claſped faſt, he takes no good by it. And this is not the leaſt part of the miſery upon the Saints, that this book is not ſo open to them, nor they do not ſo underſtand it, nor diſcern that which is in it as they might.</p>
               <p>We hear the word many of us many times, and we ſeem to receive it: but yet who is he that may not find in himſelf, that the ſleep and ſecurity of his mind and ſoul, makes him not much to attend and regard it? that he is not careful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in the keeping and maintaining of that he hears, and the framing himſelf according to it? And ſo it comes to paſs that it is with Gods word that we hear, as it is with Phyſick when it is given to a man that is dead, it works not, or when he ſleeps immediately upon it: ſo when we hear the word of God, and fall into a ſleep upon it: into the ſleep and ſluggiſhneſs of earthly cares, the Word is unprofitable, if works not that effect that elſe it would.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2: When men intend nothing but ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> a man that ſleeps, you ſhall know it by this, he doth not mind his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſineſs; he neither troubles his head, nor his hands with it; his buſineſs ſleeps with himſelf: he doth nothing but ſleep, while he is aſleep he can do nothing elſe. So hereby we may know our ſelves to be in a marvellons ſleep of ſin, when we give not our ſerious thoughts to God, and to the practice of piety, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: it is an argument of ſleep and ſlumber in us. The mind of man ſhould intend the principal thing for which God hath put us in the world; when we give not our thoughts to God, and mind not the things of Gods Kingdom, it is a ſign we are aſleep. When we move not, nor ſtir not our hands and our feet in the wayes of Gods Commandements as we ſhould, it proceeds from this ſleepineſs and drowſineſs. Whereas would we be wiſe for our ſelves, and awake as we ſhould, <hi>We ſhould neither be idle, nor unfruitful in the work of the Lord.</hi> We ſhould ever be doing ſomewhat that might glorifie God, and further our own reckoning, But <pb n="310" facs="tcp:47453:162"/>this is a ſigne of a ſleepy perſon, in the main and principal things, his heart is not upon them, his hands and feet move not in the wayes of God; he works not to the principal end for which he came into the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 Waſting of time.</note> you ſhall know a ſleepy man by this, he knows not of the paſſing of the time; but ſo much time as he ſleeps he waſtes, it is as the time of death to him; for what is ſleep but <hi>the ſhadow of death.</hi> Even ſo it is with many of us, that profeſs the teaching of Grace; Alas, how do we waſte time inſenſibly? and paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the time: ſome deck away the time, ſome play away the time, dayes, and weeks, and months together, as if time were not made for ſome other buſineſs: as if we had received time for ſuch imployments as theſe, for our recreations, and ſports, and pleaſures: and not rather that we might further our Repentance, and our Recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and help the ſervants of God, and get <hi>Oyl in our Lamps,</hi> and Faith in our Souls, and patience againſt the time of trouble, and get aſſurance of a bleſſed inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when we ſhall be turned out hence. Time is given us for theſe ends; and yet we (ſilly men as we are) deviſe paſtimes to our ſelves, as if our life did not paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, whereas <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, it is as a <hi>Weavers ſhuttle.</hi> Let us conſider Brethren, time will paſs that we may improve it, and not waſte our time.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly,
<note place="margin">4 Decay of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat.</note> to conclude this Point, a man that is addicted immoderately to ſleep, you ſhall know it by this, it deſtroyes natural heat, and that being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by immoderate ſleep, as by a ſudden mighty ſhower, this man grows purſie, and fat, and lazy, he grows idle, and unfit for the exerciſes of man-hood, or of his Calling, and the like. So it is when a man is immoderately and exceſſively faſt aſleep with the cares of this Life, the luſts of his heart, the pleaſures of this preſent world, or whatſoever it is that luls him, and rocks this Cradle; when he is thus aſleep, he grows fat and purſie, his natural heat is gone, he falls from his firſt zeal, and affection, and deſire, and practice.</p>
               <p>Alas Brethren, we may ſpeak to the ſhame and ſorrow of many (I doubt that hear me) that have exchanged their care of godlineſs; that have exchanged their ſeeking of God in the means, with company, with good-fellowſhip, with Drunkenneſs. And let the Lords Marriners come to them, and ſay, <hi>Up ſleeper, call upon thy God;</hi> why doſt thou not <hi>do thy firſt works?</hi> Why art thou lazy? he grows angry as <hi>Jonas</hi> was, that thought he did <hi>well to be angry to the death.</hi> This is the miſery of many that live under the teaching of the Goſpel; in the light of the Goſpel. This is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mark, and a ſigne of ſleep, when we cannot abide of any thing to be wakened.</p>
               <p>To draw to a Concluſion:
<note place="margin">Exhortation to awake from ſleep.</note> the laſt Uſe of this Point, it ſerves to rouze, and to raiſe us from this ſleep and ſecurity; this ſlumber that is in the beſt of us. And know my Brethren, I ſpeak not now to thoſe that are out of the Church, and thoſe that are notoriouſly wicked, thoſe that are ſcandalous, and rebellious to good Counſel: but I ſpeak to thoſe that live in the boſom of the Church, thoſe that profeſs goodneſs and godlineſs; yea, thoſe that are Diſciples, and are near the ſide of Chriſt: let this exhortation be to them to raiſe and rouze themſelves out of this ſleep. <hi>It is time,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that we riſe out of ſleep.</hi> The ſum of this Exhortation I will propound, and then draw to a concluſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt conſider how unprofitable a man,
<note place="margin">1 It is unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</note> a Chriſtian man is, when he is aſleep: What is a man when he is aſleep? but that there is hope of awaking, and to come to the actions of life again, a man that is aſleep, he lives but the life of a Plant, there is nothing but being and nouriſhment: a waking Beaſt is more profitable, but that (I ſay) there is hope that afterwards he will awake So when we ſleep, and ſlumber, and tumble, and toſs our ſelves in dead ſecurity, how unprofitable are we to Gods glory, and to our own ſelves? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was unprofitable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his converſion: but now, ſaith he, <hi>he is profitable both to thee and me.</hi> A man that is aſleep, is unprofitable: and certainly he that is aſleep in ſecurity and ſin, this man is moſt unprofitable to Gods glory, and to his own ſoul.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 It unfits for duty.</note> conſider when a man ſleeps, and ſlumbers in ſin, how unfit he is for any Chriſtian duty and exerciſe, for the main parts of Godlineſs and Chriſtianity? How unfit is a ſleepy man for the actions of life, and of his calling? and how unfit and unable, and indiſpoſed is a man that ſleeps in ſin, to the actions of ſpiritual life? <pb n="311" facs="tcp:47453:162"/>There be ſome main parts and branches of our general Calling, to which this ſleep makes us unable.</p>
               <p>The firſt of them is the exerciſe of godlineſs,
<note place="margin">1 Exerciſe.</note> the main thing in the profeſſion of a Chriſtian to exerciſe himſelf in godlineſs: how unfit is a ſleepy Chriſtian for this? who ſees a man that is aſleep that works in his Calling that can do any good in it? So how can a Chriſtian exerciſe himſelf in the actions of his general Calling, when he ſleeps? in his praying, in his hearing, in his reading? if theſe duties be done coldly, what are they worth? Actions that are done in a mans ſleep, they come to nothing: ſo a man that ſleeps in ſin, let him do never ſo many good actions, they are of no value.</p>
               <p>A ſecond main branch of our Chriſtian Calling,
<note place="margin">2 Combate.</note> is the ſpiritual combate, to fight againſt our corruptions. Now alas how unfit is a ſleepy man, either to expect, or to repel an enemy? when he is aſleep he lies open to all diſadvantage. <hi>Siſera</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a ſtrong and noble Captain, was ſo weak, that a ſilly woman <hi>Jael</hi> ſhew him when he was aſleep: therefore we know this part of our Chriſtian calling cannot hold as long as we ſleep in ſin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 To wait our Maſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> another part, and main branch of Chriſtianity is, to expect our Maſters return, to wait for the coming of our Lord, that we may enjoy that ſweet bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he hath promiſed, and made us expect and wait for: now how unfit is a ſleepy man to wait for his Maſters coming? to ſet things in order? Thus we ſee in theſe particular main duties of Chriſtianity they cannot be performed by men that are aſleep, therefore we had need to wake our ſelves: if we will either honour God, or profit our ſelves, if we will be fit to do ſervice to God, or to his Church, we muſt keep our ſelves awake, eſpecially in the main duties of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 Our enemy ſleeps not.</note> conſider while we ſleep, and are ſecure, the enemy never ſleeps, he is then moſt watchful againſt us. We may ſleep, and think we do well enough to take our eaſe, but Satan ſleeps not; we have a watchful enemy to deal with.</p>
               <p>And then he hath ſome advantage by our ſleeping;
<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. in that Parable, <hi>The enemy ſows tares, while men ſlept:</hi> he comes into the field of the heart, where the word of God, the good ſeed is ſown, and what doth he do there? he ſows a crop of thorns, and they make the heart of a Chriſtian, like the field of <hi>Solomons</hi> ſluggard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.
<note place="margin">Prov. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>I paſſed by the field of the ſluggard, and it was all thorns,</hi> &amp;c. Thus is the heart that is neglected of a man that is ſleepy, and ſecure in ſin. When do rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and theeves aſſault the houſe? In the dead time of the night, when they may take men at advantage, in their firſt ſleep, then they come and break into the houſe. Shall theeves and burglaries watch at mid-night to break the houſe, and cut mens throats, and wilt not thou watch to ſave thy ſelf?</p>
               <p>Further conſider,
<note place="margin">4 Gods mercy ſleeps not.</note> as the enemy never ſleeps, ſo Gods mercy never ſleeps, Gods mercy is ever watching over us, to do us good; and it watcheth to keep us watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: for what ſhould all the mercies of God do to us, but keep us watchful? Our God that we ſerve is not as <hi>Baal,</hi> the God of Idolaters, <hi>perhaps he is aſleep, and muſt be awaked, or he is chaſing his adverſaries;</hi> No, no, the <hi>ſtrength that keeps Iſrael, ſlumbers not, nor ſleeps.</hi> Therefore let not Iſrael ſlumber nor ſleep: becauſe God watcheth over his children, let them watch with him, and keep themſelves neer to him.</p>
               <p>Fiftly,
<note place="margin">5 Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſleep not.</note> if this will not move thee, then conſider as Gods mercy ſleeps not; ſo Gods judgments ſleep not. Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> man that ſleeps in ſin, let him know that Gods judgments ſleep not. As <hi>Balaam</hi> when he was out of the way, the Angel watcheth him, and catcheth him in this corner, and in that corner; he could go into no corner, but the Angel with his drawn ſword was ready to meet him, and to ſlay him. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith of thoſe that were led away by falſe teachers; <hi>Their damnation ſleepeth not.</hi> Gods judgments are alway waking: thou maiſt ſleep on both ſides in ſin, but Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſleepeth not. And thou that art the Lords, if thou ſleep, know that correction, and chaſtiſement ſleepeth not, and they will awake thee, thou wert better to awake by ſlighter means.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:47453:163"/>To conclude all,
<note place="margin">6 We are all to meet death.</note> conſider that all of us, there is no man upon the earth, but we are all going to meet the mortal ſleep of death; and if we ſhall when that meets us, have our own conſciences tell us, that we have alſo a ſpiritual ſleep within us; that we carry a ſpiritnal ſleep to meet that mortal ſleep, what a miſerable, and mournful ſtate will that be? when the heart of man or woman that is coming to die, ſhall ſay, and ſpeak aloud, and witneſs againſt his Maſter, O, thou haſt been a ſluggiſh and ſleepy Chriſtian: thou haſt had good means but thou haſt not kept thy watch, thou wouldeſt ſleep do what the exhortations of the Word could, thou wouldeſt be a drowſie Chriſtian. Hence it comes to paſs that ſo many, when on their death-bed they come to grapple with that mortal ſleep, and then conſcience porclaims againſt them, then they cry, Oh that I had but one day, but one hour more, that I might waken, <hi>and ſtrengthen the things that are ready to die,</hi> and that it might be better with me then it is. But alas now their ſhort day is paſt, and one perpetual night to come, and now it is too late, as it proves many times. Therefore let not time go, but know that that mournful day muſt come upon us, we muſt meet that mortal ſleep: Let us labour to ſhake off ſpiritual ſleep, drowſineſs of ſpirit, and make our peace in the mean time, that conſcience may witneſs with us, and for us at the day of death, and judgment. Let us labour to be watchful, and deſire to be ready for the Lord, and to have our accounts ready for him. This ſhall ſuffice for the words.</p>
               <p>Now for our occaſion: becauſe this is my firſt occaſion of this kind, I muſt enter with a preface, and that is this: that as I have ever been in the courſe of my miniſtery, ſo I ſhall be very ſparing in the praiſe of the dead, becauſe I know that theſe exerciſes are appointed for the inſtructing of the living, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of thoſe that ſurvive, and not for the praiſe, and commemoration of the dead.</p>
               <p>Beſides, I know, and ſee by daily experience every where, how few there be that in their life time deſerve the praiſe of Religion in their death. For my part I never did, nor never will gild a rotten poſt, or a mud wall, or give falſe witneſs in praiſing; to give the praiſe of Religion to thoſe that deſerve it not. I deſire thoſe of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation would make their own <hi>Funeral Sermons</hi> while they be living, by their vertuous life, and converſation. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He hath not praiſe, that is praiſed of meh: but he that is praiſed of God.</hi>

               <p>This holy Saint (<hi>Abraham</hi>) as he was the Father of the Faithful, ſo he was a pattern to all the faithful in both theſe, both in his tryals, and in Gods aſſiſtance. There was never any man called to more tryals than he: to leave his Country, and his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and his Fathers houſe; and after to ſacrifice his own Son. And there was never any man more aſſiſted from God; as we ſee in thoſe many apparitions that God vouchſafed him: Comforting him, ſometimes in Dreams and Viſions. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he appeared to him in an admirable and moſt friendly manner, talking with him, as a man doth with his Friend. One of them are in this Chapter; <hi>The Lord appeared to Abraham,</hi> and comforted him in the midſt of his tryals and troubles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:47453:164"/>Where you may ſee an admirable incouragement that God gives to his ſervant <hi>Abraham;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note> You may note,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the incouragement it ſelf; that is, <hi>not to fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, note the time, when God gave him this incouragement: when he had encountred with thoſe Kings immediatly before, as we ſee in Chapter 14. And when he was to encounter with many evils and troubles after, <hi>then the Lord appeared to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, note the manner, how God is pleaſed to reveal this comfort; that is, by way of viſion: <hi>God appeared</hi> by viſion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, note the ground of this comfort, and incouragemeat that God gives him, and that is taken from a twofold Argument.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what God was to him, in regard of any evils, that he did feel, or fear, he was his <hi>ſhield</hi> to bear them off. Secondly, in regard of all the good things that <hi>Abraham</hi> could loſe in the world, <hi>an exceeding great reward:</hi> he would be to him all in all.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> They that are in covenant with God, may be without car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fear.</note> 
                  <hi>and labour to keep his covenant</hi> (as faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and did) <hi>they may be a people without all carnal, and inordinate fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Abraham</hi> felt much, and had juſt cauſe to expect more, but in the middeſt of all, God appeared to him, and bid him he ſhould not fear. And what was ſpoken to <hi>Abraham,</hi> is ſpoken to us: for he was the Father of the faithful, and they <hi>that are of the faith with Abraham, are bleſſed with him.</hi> So then the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the incouragements that were given to him, they belong not to him only, but to all that are the ſpiritual ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to all the faithful: ſo that the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not limitted to him, but extends to all.</p>
               <p>A Doctrine, if ever needful, it is now. We know how it is with all men that are out of Covenant with God. <hi>Adam</hi> as ſoon as he had ſinned, he runs from God, he was afraid, and hid himſelf from the face of God, ſo every unregenerate man is (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his conſcience be ignorant, in a dead ſleep, and cauterized:) for he ſeeth God on the one ſide a revenging Judge: and he knows himſelf on the other ſide to be guilty, and therefore he cannot but with amazement and fear continually tremble before God: and he deſires if it were poſſible, that there were no God at all, that he might never be called to account for his doings. But now the child of God, a faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> that is in covenant with God, he may in the middeſt of all evils lift up his head with joy and comfort, even when wicked men are at their wits end, and know not whether to turn themſelves.</p>
               <p>It is (I ſay) a point needful to urge in theſe times, wherein we hear abroad of wars, and rumors of wars, and ſo many diſtractions: and what they feel we have cauſe to fear: but now it is ſeaſonable at this time, when we ſee the <hi>King of fears</hi> act his part before our eyes: he that the Philoſophers call, the moſt terrible of all terribles; that is, Death, that tends to the extirpation, and abolition of nature, in regard of our being here. I ſay there cannor be a better argument treated of, then ſomewhat that may fence us againſt the fear of this evil.</p>
               <p>Now for the opening of this point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, conſider what <hi>fear</hi> is.</p>
               <p>And then what <hi>fear</hi> a Chriſtian ſhould be freed from.</p>
               <p>And then how it comes to paſs that a Chriſtian is exempted from all ſlaviſh, and inordinate fear.</p>
               <p>And then come to make ſome Uſe of it to the preſent occaſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 What fear is.</note> that we may know the point the better, let us conſider, what <hi>fear</hi> is in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; And <hi>fear</hi> (beloved) <hi>is</hi> ſuch <hi>An affection or paſſion of the ſoul that is ſtirred up with a through apprehenſion of ſome future evil, that is very difficult to be reſiſted by the party, or patient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is an affection, or paſſion of the ſoul: for it makes a real tranſmutation in the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:47453:164"/>It is ſuch an affection, as is ſtirred up with the apprehenſion of evil: for evil is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the object of fear: we do not primarily fear any thing that is good, axcept the loſs of it, and it is ill to loſe any good thing.</p>
               <p>Again, it is evil future: for if the evil be preſent, we grieve, and not fear.</p>
               <p>And it is ſuch an evil as is difficult, and hard to reſiſt, an overcome with patience: for if it be a ſmall evil that is eaſily conquered, you contemn it, you fear it not. You ſee then what fear is in general.</p>
               <p>Is all fear prohibited?</p>
               <p>Not the fear of God, &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Kinds off fear.</note> Fear is oft commanded in Scripture, know then there are divers kinds of fear.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 Natural.</note> natural fear, and that is called natural either in regard of the material or effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe.</p>
               <p>When the party that doth fear, is phlegmatick, or melancholly, and ſo is naturally inclined to fear, this may be called a natural ſear.</p>
               <p>Or, in regard of the object, when there is ſomewhat in that which is deſtructive to nature: and therefore the fear of death, it is natural to man, and ſo whatſoever may prejudice nature.</p>
               <p>Now this natural fear is an affection that Almighty God concreated with the ſoul, it is naturally good, it is morally neither good nor evil, but according as it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2 Carnal fear.</note> there is a carnal evil fear, namely, when a man fears the evil of puniſhment, more then the evil of ſin; a corporal evil more then a ſpiritual: a temporal more then an eternal. He is afraid of loſing ſomething he enjoyes, or of not getting ſomething he deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In either regards there may be a carnal fear, as I ſhall explain it to you more anon: and this ſo far as it is carnal is ever to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 Servile fear.</note> there is a ſervile fear: and this is ſuch a fear as looks at the puniſhment only, and not at the ſin: when a man is afraid of the judgements of GOD, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fears ſin, that is the cauſe of it. And ſo withal, when this fear is only ſervile, and is retained in the heart, that man deſires ſtill to ſin; there is a love of ſin, a wiſhing that God would give him leave to ſin, and let looſe the reins to him: that if it were poſſible there were no God, no Devil, no Heaven, nor Hell, that he might ſin were poſſible there were no God, no Devil, no Heaven, nor hell, that he might ſin freely. And if he abſtain from ſin at any time, the cauſe is, that there is this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is the conſequent of ſin, and not out of love to God, or obedience to his commandements.</p>
               <p>Now this ſervile fear, though in it ſelf it be not ſavingly pleaſing to God, yet it is a thing that is good, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves; for that man that fears ſervily, he doth that which is good, though he doth it not well: becauſe that is a thing that depends upon the diſpoſition, and will of him that doth the thing, though the thing be good as far as it goes.
<note place="margin">Act 2.</note> It is good for the reſtraining of evil men from outrages in the world, and it is a preparative in the way to converſion, as it is <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">4 Filial fear</note> there is a filial ſon-like fear, that ariſeth out of the conſideration of the greatneſs, and eſpecially of the goodneſs of God, whereby a man ſo hates puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he hates ſin alſo the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>Now there are divers degrees of filial fear.</p>
               <p>One degree we call innitial fear in this World.</p>
               <p>And a degree of perfection in the world to come.</p>
               <p>In this world the fear we have, hath one eye upon the puniſhment, and another eye upon the commandement, or love of God. And here many make a doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are to do that which is good, having an eye to the recompence of reward, or to abſtain from evil out of the fear of puniſhment.</p>
               <p>For anſwer briefly. And thing almighty God hath made a motive to us, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to do well, or to deter us from evil; we may make a motive to our ſelves, and as long as we do ſo, we do well. It was ſo with <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, this was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as a motive; <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die.</hi> Then to abſtain from the forbidden fruit, partly out of fear of puniſhment, If <hi>Adam</hi> did ſo, he did well. So, every one of us in regard of any evil, we may have an eye to the puniſhment, that <pb n="316" facs="tcp:47453:165"/>will be the conſequent of the thing: for Chriſt urgeth this to his own Diſciples, <hi>Fear not him that can kill the body,</hi> &amp;c. And to do things meerly without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to puniſhment at all; I know no reaſon why any man ſhould aſpire to that perfection. For God while we are here, hath given us theſe motives, to ſtir us up to avoid evil; and it is well if we can heartily and truly, out of love to God do it, by all the motives that God hath propounded.</p>
               <p>To have a fear meerly for puniſhment, and ſtill to retain the love of ſin, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or love to the commandement of God, this is not acceptable to God in a ſaving manner: but to have an eye to God, and to abſtain from ſin, partly out of love to God, and partly out of fear of puniſhment, this is acceptable to God. For a man muſt love himſelf in ſubordination to the love of God; and therefore he may look to the avoiding of evil, and to the getting of good eternal to ſoul and body.</p>
               <p>Now theſe fears, we may conſider of them thus. The natural fear may be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Spirit, but it comes not from the Spirit, that muſt be ordered by the word of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, carnal fear comes not from the ſpirit, nor is accompanied with it: this is ever to be mortified, this we muſt take heed of; and this fear <hi>Abraham</hi> is exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt here.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the fear that is ſervile, it comes from the ſpirit, but it is not accompanied with the ſpirit. As the dawning of the day the Sun is the cauſe of it, yet the Sun is not preſent when the day dawns, but ſome glimps goes before him: this we muſt cheriſh, ſo as we bring it to filial fear, and then we deal aright in that.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for filial fear, we muſt cheriſh that at all times, we muſt labour to get ſtill a more reverent reſpect of the Majeſty of God. So I have briefly ſhewed you what fear is.</p>
               <p>And what fear we muſt labour to be freed from; all ſlaviſh and carnal fear, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the world, or any thing in the world; any ill that may befall us, or any good that may be taken from us. Now you ſee that a Chriſtian is ſuch a man as may live without all fear, that is carnal; <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body.</hi> And in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8.12.
<note place="margin">Iſa: 8: 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Fear not their fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is the ground of this?</p>
               <p>I will tell you briefly;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> We are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from our enemies ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Luke 1.47.</note> Chriſt came into the world to <hi>deliver us from</hi> all <hi>our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> that <hi>we might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs,</hi> Luke 1.47. So then the ground is this, that man that hath no enemies; that man that cannot poſſibly be moleſted with any evil, what need he fear? For there is no evil in the world that can ſurprize a man that is in covenant with God, that labours to keep his covenant, but by the power of the Spirit he may conquer it. For only evil, and evil future is the object of fear. Now, if there be no evil that can befall a child of God, but ſuch as may be conquered, he ſhould contemn it, and not fear it. Now all the enemies of a Chriſtian are either reconciled or conquered and foyled, and what then need he fear them?</p>
               <p>For God that is an enemy to every man naturally,
<note place="margin">1 By reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</note> he is reconciled; Chriſt hath made our peace with God, he hath made our attonement, we need not fear him ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhly: though we may, and muſt fear him with a filial fear, we muſt not be afraid of him with horrour, as to run from him; but we muſt ſo love him, as to <hi>reverence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his foot-ſtool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, in regard of the evils of the world, they are enemies too: but how? Chriſt hath been pleaſed to ſweeten theſe to us: <hi>all things in the world</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of afflictions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.) <hi>they work for good to them that fear God.</hi> Shall a man be afraid of his own good? Nay, there is nothing in the world that more works our good, then afflictions, and loſſes, and croſſes: we might ſpare any thing better then them: ſhall we be afraid of that that works our good? Death it is reconciled, and made our friend: It was the greateſt enemy; Chriſt hath pulled out the ſting, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the nature of it; he hath made it the birth-day of eternity, a ſweet paſſage to a better life. Death brings not evil to a man that is in covenant with God, but rather terminates all evil, that he is moleſted with in the world. So then ſome enemies are reconciled and made our friends, and theſe we have no reaſon to fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:47453:165"/>Again,
<note place="margin">2 By conqueſt,</note> there are ſome that are irreconcileable, and they are conquered and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The Divel will never be friends with us, therefore Chriſt <hi>hath ſpoyled princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and powers;</hi> and trampled Satan under-feet: and now if he walk about, yet he is in his chain, he can bite, but he can hurt none but thoſe that willingly betray themſelves into his hands.</p>
               <p>For ſin, it is of a condemning nature; but thoſe that are in covenant with God, and walk with him, it is <hi>removed as far from them as the Eaſt is from the Weſt,</hi> it is thrown into the bottomeleſs ſea of Gods mercy, ſo that it ſhall never anger God or hurt us any more then if we had not committed it; <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay more, God hath beſtowed his Spirit, whereby he hath freed our hearts, and whereby if a man labour to <hi>ſtir up the grace of God in him,</hi> and to walk comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as he might in the preſence of God, he might through the power of God free his heart from theſe horrours and fears; for faith the Apoſtle, <hi>ye have not received the Spirit of bondage to fear again: but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</hi> The Spirit of bondage caſts down the ſoul mith horrour and fear, but we have the Spirit of God to aſſure us that we have God for our Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in Chriſt, and ſo by conſequent that our ſins are pardoned, that death is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, that <hi>Principalities and powers are ſpoyled,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> in the world, (though contrary in themſelves yet) they <hi>ſhall work for our good.</hi> So you ſee the ground of it, a Chriſtian hath no enemies, ſome enemies are reconciled and others are trampled under foot that they cannot hurt him. And we receive this freedome by the Spirit of God, that if we would ſtir it up, and labour to walk as becometh Chriſtians we may make our lives very comfortable.</p>
               <p>Briefly for Application.</p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The power of grace muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on a mans ſelf.</note>
               <p>Firſt, let us all take notice of the command that God gives to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of this incouragement, and make uſe of it to our ſelves; and know that the power of grace, and Religion muſt reflect upon a mans ſelf. He (beloved) ſhall be accounted the beſt Chriſtian before God, and in the ſight of judicious men, whoſe Religion is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and reflects upon himſelf. Now there are many buſie ones in the world, that meddle with the converſations of others, and are ſtill talking, and complaining of things without themſelves; but ſurely, he is a happy man that reformes himſelf, and that ſets in tune his own affections and paſſions: as this in particular, to labour to be without ſlaviſh and inordinate fear. Alas we may complain of many that find fault with many things, but if they look within, there is a combuſtion of a great many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly affections, and paſſions, and theſe are the things we never complain of: we find not fault with our ſelves as we ſhould, we ſhould take notice of the Law of God that it is ſpiritual, to ſet in order our hearts and minds and ſouls, as well as our tongues and hands. The law of man reacheth but to the outward man, if a man keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in order in regard of theſe, thought is free, and the Law doth not take hold of a man for his affections, but the Law of God doth, therefore you know that <hi>luſting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a moman,</hi> in Gods account is reputed <hi>adultery,</hi> the <hi>hating of a mans brother in his heart is accounted manſlaughter;</hi> he is accounted a <hi>murtherer that hates his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> ſo he that is <hi>angry unadviſedly,</hi> you know what he is in danger of: and that man is accounted guilty before God, that cannot order his affections in regard of thoſe unruly paſſions that are within him. This I obſerve by the way. God in Scripture takes eſpecial notice of it; and I am perſwaded it is an infallible diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing character between an hypocrite and a ſincere child of God: an hypocrite labours to waſh the outſide, he hath a demure countenance, clean hands, ſmooth lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, &amp;c. theſe things are good, but he goes no further, he makes no conſcience of ſecret contemplative wickedneſs, of the luſts of his heart, and the thoughts of his mind: theſe things he never enters into himſelf to mortifie. But that man that is conſcionable, ſo walks with God; as that a wrie affection, an inward luſt after ſomewhat that is evil, troubles him, and humbles him before God: the vanity of his thoughts in ſecret cauſe him to mourn before God: this is a ſign of a man that walks before God, and accounts <hi>God a Spirit that ſearcheth the hearts and tryeth the rains:</hi> and therefore if ever we will approve our ſelves to God, let our Religion be <pb n="318" facs="tcp:47453:166"/>practical, and reflect upon our ſelves, and among other things upon our inward man to ſet that in order.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Poſſible to live without fear.</note> by way of inſtruction, we ſee what happy men and women we might be if we were not our own foes, if we could attain this pitch to live without fear that nothing ſhould trouble us, were it not a happy condition? ſurely it is a thing feaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſome Saints have attained it in a great meaſure; you know <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Ziglag</hi> was taken, his wives gone, all the ſpoyl taken, and the people were ready to ſtone him, what did poor <hi>David?</hi> he can <hi>incourage himſelf in the Lord his God</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this. So it may be with a poor Chriſtian, his friends may forſake him; perhaps the world is gone, <hi>riches take to themſelves wings,</hi> it may be his body is crazy and all things are out of order, yet this man can <hi>incourage himſelf in the Lord his God,</hi> he can ſay to himſelf <hi>fear not</hi> Saith <hi>David, though I walk in the valley of the ſhadow of death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm 23</note> a doleful condition, <hi>yet I will fear none ill, Pſal.</hi> 23. And in another place, <hi>though ten thouſand ſhould compaſs me in on every ſide I would lay me down and reſt.</hi> Though the Apoſtles were watched by ſouldiers, laid in the ſtocks, and for ought they knew the next day they ſhould be brought to execution, yet they ſing as merrily and ſleep as heartily as if they had been on a Throne, and had been Kings in a Pallace. Thus a good conſcience will make a Chriſtian happy, if he be not his own foe: but our hearts are intangled with the world and worldly things, that for the moſt part we ſee not this priviledge. But I leave that.</p>
               <p>Next it may ſerve to reprehend and chide the moſt of us,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Reproof for inordinate fear.</note> yea all, in that we are diſtracted with fears unneceſſary, ſuch as ſpend our ſpirits, and conſume our preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time, ſuch things as make our lives uncomfortable, and diſhonour God, and our Religion and profeſſion, and all to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Some things we fear a great while before we need,
<note place="margin">1 We fear too ſoon.</note> perhaps that we need not fear at all. One faith Lord, what would become of me if I ſhould looſe my wife? if I ſhould looſe my children? or looſe my eſtate? What would become of me if the times ſhould be hard, if there ſhould be a dear year? I can ſcarſe bring both ends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether now.</p>
               <p>Another faith, what ſhall I do when I am old, and cannot take pains for my living? thus men fear a thouſand inconveniences. What need we meet evils half way? what need we create to our ſelves ſuch troubles? <hi>ſufficient for the day are the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in regard of carnal fear,
<note place="margin">2 Too much.</note> all things make us afraid more then we need, and the fear of ill oft-times perplexeth a man more then the ill it ſelf that lights upon him. And men of a melancholly diſpoſition they frame to themſelves ſuch ſtrange Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera's, Imaginations of things that perhaps ſhall never come to paſs, and ſo trouble themſelves with a great deal of fear. Thou art afraid of ſuch and ſuch loſſes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou maiſt die firſt, and ſuch things perhaps ſhall never befall thee: labour to prepare thy heart before hand, and then fear them not.</p>
               <p>I will ſhew you the inconveniences of this,
<note place="margin">1 It brings a great deal of ill.</note> briefly.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, theſe fears of loſſes and croſſes, and the like, they often bring a great deal of ill to men; nay it brings a great deal of ill as the natural event and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of it,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 66.4</note> partly by the judgement of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.4. <hi>I will bring their fears upon them.</hi> And that <hi>that wicked men fear ſhall come upon them.</hi> This is the way to bring ill upon them, when men will needs be miſerable is it not juſt with God they ſhould?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Romans will come and take away our Empire,</hi> and ſo it was. <hi>Saul</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that <hi>David</hi> ſhould ſucceed him, and ſo he did. When men will not learn to live by faith, it is juſt with God to bring that that they fear upon them, becauſe they diſhonour him by unbelief.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place it not only brings ill,
<note place="margin">2 It unfits the heart to bear evils.</note> but it makes the heart unfit for ill when it comes. <hi>In the fear of man their is a ſnare: but in the confidence of the Lord, there is a ſure reward.</hi> In the fear of man there is a ſnare: what doth fear do? It in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnares a man, it binds a man hand and foot, and layes him flat before his enemy when he comes, and then his enemy tramples upon him. It ſo weakens the Spirits and diſheartneth a man before it comes, that when it comes he is no way able to bear it. 
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:47453:166"/>
For the fear takes away all the joy and content that a man may take in the preſent good that he enjoyes at the hand of God, that he cannot enjoy that, becauſe he fears I know not what ill that may come; and then when that ill comes he is not able to bear it, his ſpirit is ſo weak.</p>
               <p>I might ſhew much hurt that this fear doth both to the ſoul, and to the body of man.</p>
               <p>To the body of man,
<note place="margin">It hurts the body.</note> how doth it weaken and contract the Spirits? and bring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes? and ſome times death it ſelf?</p>
               <p>Fear doth much hurt to the ſoul,

<note place="margin">1 Natural.</note> it weakens a man in regard of the operations of his ſonl, that the body is not a fit inſtrument for the ſoul to work by. It makes a man do divers things raſhly and inconſiderately, and divers things out of incogitancy, that he knows not what he doth; he is unfit for holy duties, unſtable in all his wayes.</p>
               <p>As he is thus in regard of his place and calling,

               <p>You ſhall ſee almoſt all the ſins in the world come from this fear.
<note place="margin">Fear the ground of moſt ſins.</note> What was the reaſon that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> did equivocate? was it not fear (in that particular) of men more then God? and ſo they put God upon a miracle to preſerve <hi>Sarahs</hi> chaſtity in the caſe of <hi>Abimeleck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What was the reaſon that <hi>Aaron</hi> yeelded to make an Idol for the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo joyned in Idolatry with them? he was afraid of the people that they might do him ſome hurt, he durſt not truſt God with his preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Maſter out of fear; What is the reaſon that a Miniſter doth not ſometimes reprove ſin? that a Magiſtrate doth not ſometimes reform that that is amiſſe? It is ſlaviſh fear, they will not truſt God to maintain them in his own cauſe. What is the reaſon that many ſervants lie, &amp;c. it is out of a ſlaviſh fear of their maſters.</p>
               <p>And ſo in regard of the things of the world, men are inordinately afraid that they ſhall loſe ſomewhat they poſſeſs, and therefore they take indirect courſes. Still this ſlaviſh fear, and horrour, and diſtruſt of God, it is almoſt the cauſe of all ſin, as we may obſerve in the world.</p>
               <p>This being ſo prejudicial,

<note place="margin">No cauſe of fear.</note> and ſee if we have cauſe of fear.</p>
               <p>For our ſpiritual enemies.
<note place="margin">1 Of ſpiritual enemies.</note> Will any man fear a wounded foe? for the Lord God hath wounded Satan, and trampled him under our feet, and brought us as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did his Captains, to ſet our feet upon the neck of principalities, and powers, that through the mighty power of God, <hi>we are more then conquerours;</hi> and ſhall we fear ſuch an enemy as this? Shall we fear thoſe ſins that we are humbled for, and which God hath made as if they had never been?</p>
               <p>For the evils of the world:
<note place="margin">2 Of worldly evils.</note> Why ſhould we fear them? thoſe corrections that are immediatly from God, there is no cauſe of fear in them. As thus: If God take away thy Wife, or thy Child, or thy friend, or a part of thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, what cauſe of fear is there: <hi>Fear not</hi> (faith God) <hi>I will chaſtiſe thee in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 46.28.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And then remember, God proportions the correction to our ſtrength, as a Father, not as a Judg: he aims at our amendment, not at our ruin; If he take away a friend, that we doted too much on: if we ſet our minds too much on the world, <pb n="320" facs="tcp:47453:167"/>and worldly things, God will deprive us of them, and ſo by this be all in all to us, and draw us neerer to himſelf: have we cauſe of fear? to fear that that comes from God?</p>
               <p>No,
<note place="margin">Object.</note> will ſome ſay, if we fall into the hands of God there is mercy, but the mercies of men are cruel. What if unreaſonable men deal with us, have we not reaſon to fear ill from them? they are outragious and cruel, they bend their malice againſt us; and if the enemy ſhould come and make an in-road into our country, and bring deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, what ſhould we do then?</p>
               <p>I anſwer,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> firſt in all things that fall from men, there is a provident hand of God: therefore faith our Saviour to his Apoſtles when he would incourage them, faith he, there is a providence even concerning ſparrows, <hi>there is none of them light on the ground</hi> without the providence of God. So, when he would encourage his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples againſt their adverſaries, <hi>your very hairs are numbred.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Almighty God knows how many hairs every man hath upon his head; he numbers all our joynts, he tells our ſteps: there is nothing befalls us, but what the provident hand of God is in. And wicked men, the Divel and all his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, God hath them in a chain, they cannot go one ſtep further then he gives them leave.</p>
               <p>Again, conſider what God laid to <hi>Abraham</hi> here; <hi>I am thy ſhield.</hi> In regard of all the evils that men attempt againſt us, whether in regard of ſcoffing, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and open hoſtility, or whatſoever, God is our ſheild. And the Pſalmiſt calls him elſe-where, <hi>our ſtrong tower.</hi> You know how it is, if men incounter a ſtrong Tower, the enemy muſt firſt batter the Tower about their ears before they can hurt the men. If a man fight with an enemy, he muſt pierce his ſhield before he can hurt the man. We may ſpeak it with ſacred reverence to the Majeſty of God, they muſt overcome God himſelf, before they can hurt his people in doing any thing that ſhall prove in the event hurtful, as long as they keep cloſe to God.</p>
               <p>The Lord intimated this to the people of Iſrael: The Egyptians marched, and followed hard after them, to devour them with open mouth, God when he ſaw that, he removes the pilſar of the Cloud, and ſet it between them: as if God ſhould have ſaid to them, you deceive your ſelves, to think to conquer my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you muſt conquer me, before you conquer them. So God is our ſtrong Tower, our ſhield, and our deliverer, and he will find deliverance for his people ſome way or other, from the evil, or in the evil, or out of it; as ſhall turn to our exceeding advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>For, ſuppoſe the worſt that can be ſuppoſed, that wicked men are let looſe on us, to do all that their malice can invent, they can but touch the body, the ſhell of the ſoul, and let the priſoner out of doors. Upon this argument Chriſt incourageth us; <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body, but fear him that can kill both body and ſoul.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Do the enemies threaten death, they promiſe you life: the greateſt advantage, and the happieſt day that ever can befall a man that is in covenant with God, is the day of death. Then all they can do, is to kill the body for a while, which God will raiſe, maugre the malice of the Divel, and all his inſtruments, and poſſeſs the ſoul of that bliſs that is prepared for it.</p>
               <p>And in regard of Death, why ſhould we fear that? if we be in covenant with God, the nature of it is changed, the ſting is out, and it is become beneficial.</p>
               <p>But you know the Saints die ſtill.</p>
               <p>The red Sea ſwallowed up the Egyptians,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi>

                  </note> and on the left. That then that was the ruin of the Egyptians, it was the protection of the Iſraelites.</p>
               <p>So, it is in regard of death, that that is the entrance to the doleful miſery of evil men, that is the moſt bliſſeful and joyful day to a child of God that can be, for then he <hi>reſts from his labours, and his works follow him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi>
                  </note> it is hard to live without fear, I enjoy many things, I am afraid to loſe them, and my children are afraid, and loath to part with me, my heart wavers, and is full of perplexity, how ſhall I be freed from this?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:47453:167"/>I know, fear is a natural thing deeply rooted in nature, think not to get the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt wholly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> How to get the conqueſt of fear:</note> but by little and little.</p>
               <p>Labour to get the Spirit of God that is ſupernatural, that muſt overcome this: for the ſtrongeſt reſolution of the moſt reſolved ſpirit in the world will not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it,
<note place="margin">1 Labour for the ſpirit:</note> it muſt be by a power that is ſtronger then our own, namely by the Spirit of GOD, that we being aſſured by the Spirit, that God is our portion, and living the life of faith, we may not fear any thing in regard of this world.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 Keep cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God</note> labour to keep our covenant with God: there is an admonition, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Only,</hi> (faith God) <hi>remember you do not rebel againſt God, and then fear not this people: for God is with you, but he hath for ſaken them. The righteous is bold as a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the wicked fears, and oft-times where there is no fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is the reaſon we are ſo faint-hearted? that we fear the loſs of the things of this world? becauſe we are not aſſured that God is our portion: for if a man were aſſured, that what he loſeth here, God would make up in regard of his preſence, that he would be <hi>All in all,</hi> inſtead of wife, and goods, and children, and honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is impoſſible that this man ſhould fear the loſs of any thing: for he poſſeſſeth all in God, and he cannot be loſt.</p>
               <p>In particular labour to ſtrengthen faith,
<note place="margin">3 Strengthen faith.</note> make God our ſtrong Tower, and live by faith, <hi>he ſhall not be afraid of ill tydings;</hi> why? <hi>his heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 1.12. When men make the things of this world their portion; when they make riches, and <hi>the arme of fleſh</hi> their portion, that they muſt rely upon; here is a reed that will either break, or pierce a mans hand. No wonder that this man fears in all occaſions, and extremities, becauſe he forſakes the Lord, and cleaves to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But that man that lives by faith is without fear; As <hi>Peter</hi> when he began to ſink, faith Chriſt, <hi>Why doſt thou fear? O thou of little faith.</hi> The reaſon he did ſink was fear, and why did he fear? becauſe his faith failed him, he did not lay hold upon God, and Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">4 To place our love aright.</note> let us remember to order our ſelves aright, in regard of our love, and this will keep us from inordinate fear. For we muſt conceive that love is the fountain of all other affections; we love things, and therefore we deſire them, if they be abſent, and we rejoyce in them if they be preſent, and we fear the loſs of them, to be abridged of them. Now let us order our love aright, in regard of the things of this world, and we ſhall never fear much:
<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> for it is the obſervation of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> we fear to loſe ſomewhat that we have attained, or not to enjoy ſomewhat that we deſire; ſo it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth from love, ſomewhat that we love and affect, we are afraid of the loſs of it, and this is the cauſe of fear. Now in regard of wealth, a man is afraid he ſhall not have enough; he ſhall not have a competency; it is becauſe he loves the things of the world too much. A man is afraid of Death, why? becauſe he loves his body too much. A man is afraid he ſhall loſe his children, or his Friends; what is the reaſon? he loves them too much, too inordinatly. We ſhould labour to love them only in, and for God, and then we ſhall not be afraid of the loſs of them, but ſhall be content to be diſpoſed in them, and in our ſelves, as God ſhall ſee convenient in his heavenly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>A word for the occaſion, and that I will diſpatch in a word.</p>
               <p>You know the occaſion of our meeting at this time, and in this place: it is to perform this laſt rite to the body of a Child that God hath taken lately to his mercy. You ſee how Almighty God is pleaſed to diſpoſe it ſometimes, even oſt-times from the Cradle to the Grave, out of the Swadling-bands to the winding-ſheet: God will have it ſo ſometimes: and when it is ſo, we muſt lay our hands upon our mouths, and be content with the will of God.</p>
               <p>For thoſe that are Parents, let all learn this leſſon, not to dote too much upon their children; not to be enamoured too much upon ſuch flowers: you know how ſoon God takes them away, before you be aware. It is not their wit, or their comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or agility, and nimbleneſs, or healthy conſtitution, or any thing that can award them from the ſtroak of death when God ſends it: Therefore learn to love them, in, and for God, for his ſake, and you ſhall have no cauſe to fear the loſs of them, or grieve immoderately, when they are taken away; why? becauſe they are all alive <pb n="322" facs="tcp:47453:168"/>ſtill to God; and this tender Babe is not loſt, he is but ſent before, he is alive ſtill in the preſence of God, the ſoul ſtillives, and the body ſhall live, and is in Gods account, Chriſt hath the charge of it, and will raiſe it at the laſt day. That man can loſe no friend, that loves his friend, in, and for God: becauſe they live with God, and he ſhall enjoy them at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Again, as we may mourn for the loſs of our friends and children (or elſe we were without natural affection) ſo we muſt rejoyce that they have gained: as we have loſt them, as they are taken from us; ſo they are taken from the evils of the world, from a great deal of ſin and miſery; and what that might have been, the Lord only knows; therefore we have cauſe to be thankful.</p>
               <p>And (beloved) be thankful too, if God ſpare any; if he take one, he might have taken all, and prepare for it too: be thankful for them that are leſt.</p>
               <p>And remember, labour betimes to inſtruct your children in the fear of God: let it be the firſt thing we infuſe into them, as ſoon as they be capable: namely, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chriſtian Religion, holy, and heavenly things, why? becauſe they may be taken away before we are aware. It may be we have but a little time, but a few op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to do good to them. I tell you what our conſcience will tell us elſe, that we have not been ſo careful to inſtruct our children, as they have been capable. And this will cut ſore, and lie heavy on our conſcience: and therefore let us do it betimes. Not only to prevent the Divel, and his temptations: but becauſe you ſee how ſuddenly they may be taken away from us in a moment.</p>
               <p>So Children ſhould be admoniſhed to learn <hi>to know the Lord God in the dayes of their youth:</hi> how ſoon that evil day may come we know not (that the wiſe man ſpeaks of) therefore betimes while ye have opportunity do it.</p>
               <p>And for our own part, let us learn this;</p>
               <p>Firſt, when God crops ſuch flowers that riſe in the bud; when he takes away ſuch Children, be thankful to God that he hath given us a longer time, that he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged our dayes, and prolonged our years; that he hath given us ſuch a great deal of ſpace, and opportunity, to glorifie him here, to do him ſervice in the land of the living, to get evidence of our Calling and election, and to get aſſurance of our peace with him. Let us praiſe God for the length of our dayes, a bleſſing of God in it ſelf, and a bleſſing to us if we improve it.</p>
               <p>Again, every one remember, if Children do die, old men muſt die, any man may die. For it Death ſtrike ſuch as do but begin to live, then we that have lived long, it is time and reaſon to expect death, and not to fear it.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not this, as if we ſhould be ſlaviſhly afraid of death: while we are ſo our lives are not comfortable. What is the reaſon that we fear it inordinatly? becauſe we love our lives, we love our bodies, and the world inordinatly, and not in, and for God.</p>
               <p>And then by the continual ſpectacles of mortality,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simile.</hi>
                  </note> let us be acquainted with death. A vizour, and apparition to a Child, ſcares him, and he runs from it at the firſt: but at laſt he grows throughly acquainted with it, and fears it not: ſo it is in regard of death, many men will not endure to hear of death, they will not endure to think of it, they will not endure to hear a <hi>Funeral Sermon,</hi> or to come to <hi>the houſ of mourning,</hi> to be put in mind of their latter end: Death is a ſtrange vizour to theſe men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they are afraid of it, and run from it, but if we did oft think of it, as oft as we think of ſin, in the cauſe of it. And when we feel ſorrow, think, here is a harbinger of death. I feel pain in me, ere long I muſt ſurrender to the ſtroak of Death. And as oft as we ſee ſpectacles of mortality, to read a lecture of Death. And when we lay our ſelves down in our beds think of Death. And upon all occaſions come to <hi>the houſe of mourning,</hi> and think of Death. If the Serpents ſting be plucked out, a man may handle it, he is ſhie at the firſt; but after, finding it cannot hurt him, he fears it not. So we have cauſe to thank God for death, as well as for other things; thus far; becauſe he hath changed the nature of it, and made it a ſweet paſſage to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life. And then though God take Children, or friends, or goods, or any thing in this world, he will be our <hi>exceeding great reward,</hi> he will be <hi>All in all</hi> to us here, and hereafter.</p>

               <p>And the reaſons are.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The Law binds men in ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</note> becauſe the Law of God binds men in their ſpeeches as well as in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I ſay the Law that ſhall judge them doth now bind them in their very ſpeeches as well as in their actions. You have two commandements expreſly taking notice of the words of men. The third commandment of the words of men concerning God, <hi>he that takes the name of Godin vain, he will not hold him guiltleſs.</hi> And then the ninth commandment of the words of men concerning men. <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy neighbour.</hi> Now God that hath made a Law to bind, and to order men in the matter of ſpeech, certainly he will judge men by that Law. You know that Kings and Princes, and Parliaments, and Kingdoms, they make not Lawes in vain, but they are the directions whereby the judges proceed in their courſe of judgment upon malefactours. So I ſay Gods Law it is not in vain, it is not a bare direction onely to us in point of obedience, but alſo the expreſs rule whereby Chriſt himſelf will proceed in matter of judgement.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Words injure God and man.</note> there is great reaſon that words as well as actions ſhould be brought to judgement, becauſe God and men are injured by words as well as by acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Firſt concerning God, you read of ſome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. <hi>that ſet their mouths againſt God, and againſt heaven.</hi> Indeed they can do no more hurt to God then a man that ſhoots an Arrow at the Sun can hurt the Sun by ſhooting at him; but in their intention they ſet themſelves againſt God in as much as their tongues are ſet againſt him.
<note place="margin">Levit. 24.11.</note> And in <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.11. The word there tranſlated to <hi>blaſpheme,</hi> it is in the original, that the man ſtabbed God, or did pierce God, he offered a kind of violence to the holy name of God. Such ſinful ſpeeches as are forbidden in the <hi>third Commandment,</hi> and do concern the name of God or any of his attributes or ordinances, any thing that is ſpoken againſt them, or without due reverence and reſpect to them, they are there ſaid to be a ſtabbing of God, in the Hebrew phraſe, or a piercing of God, a wounding of God, doing ſome violence to God himſelf. Now I ſay when ſuch wrong and injury is done to God, ſhall not God take a time to right himſelf of thoſe that injure him?</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is an injury done to men. You know it is a common thing in Law to have actions againſt men for ſpeeches, they make ſpeeches actions; they make them lyable to the penalty and cenſure of the Law for ſpeeches. So the Law of God proceeds according to the very ſpeeches of men, whereby they have diſcouraged his ſervants in any kind at any time, in any duty of Religion, and courſe of his worſhip, or whereby they have brought <hi>an ill report</hi> on it. As thoſe <hi>ſpies</hi> did upon the Land, therefore, they might not be ſuffered to go into the Land: So I ſay when men bring an evil report upon the duties of godlineſs they ſhut themſelves out of the kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe when men make that which is ſtraight become crooked: It is ſaid of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> that he <hi>perverted the ſtraight wayes ef God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> that is, he did as much as lay in him to make the ſtraight wayes of God to ſeem crooked, that as a man that puts a ſtick in the water though it be ſtraight when it is put in, yet it ſeems crooked <pb n="325" facs="tcp:47453:169"/>when it is in: So when a man puts colours and ſhews upon good actions and courſes, as if they were folly and indiſcretion, and unadviſed, and hypocriſie, and vain, or whatſoever is ill, this is to make the ſtraight wayes of God crooked; to make that that God accounts ſtraight to be crooked, this is a ſetting againſt God: therefore <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Simon Magus, pray if it be poſſible that the thought of thy heart may be for given thee.</hi> So you ſee Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Elymas</hi> the ſorcerer upon the ſame ground, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. <hi>Thou child of the divel and enemy to all righteouſneſs, wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right wayes of God?</hi> Now I ſay, here are the words and ſpeeches that men ſpeak againſt the wayes of God: theſe are ſpeeches that argue men in a ſtate, whereby they are liable and open to judgment, and expoſed to wrath, therefore we ſhould take heed of ſuch words.</p>
               <p>The uſe may be to condemn thoſe that make light account of words;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> To condemn thoſe that make light account of words.</note> they think they may ſpeak (it may be) in raſhneſs, and haſtineſs, and they may be excuſed for uttering them, it is there haſtineſs, and their paſſion, and it was done unadviſedly, &amp;c. I but the Law of God is tranſgreſſed, the Majeſty of God is offended, the anger of God is provoked. You know what old <hi>Eli</hi> ſaid to his Sons; <hi>My ſons, if a man ſin againſt a man, man may plead for him, but if he offend againſt God, who ſhall plead for him?</hi> I ſay who ſhall take up the matter with God in ſuch a caſe as this, when the offence ſtrikes againſt God, and his ordinances, and his worſhip? Therefore take heed there is much evil, there <hi>is life and death</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>in the power of the tongue,</hi> that is, a man may utterly deſtroy himſelf by the very words he ſpeaks unadviſedly (as he thinks, and will plead for himſelf) or paſſionately and raſhly.</p>
               <p>Again much more doth it concern thoſe that proceed to other kinds of wickedneſs in the tongue, we inſtanced in ſome particular inſtances then, that we cannot now ſtand on.</p>
               <p>We came to direct men to carry themſelves in their ſpeech, as <hi>David, to ſet a watch before the door of their lippes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pal. 39.</note> he prayed to God to do it; And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. <hi>I ſaid that I will take heed to my wayes that I offend not in my tongue.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal 131.</note> And then he prayes to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. <hi>to keep a watch before the door of his mouth.</hi> He knew well enough that there will be a time, when the words that we think are ſleight and vain ſhall be brought to judgement, idle, unprofitable, frothy talk, much more rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reviling ſpeeches, moſt of all the higheſt blaſphemies and execrations, theſe ſhall moſt certainly be brought to a greater cenſure at the day of judgment. But I will not ſtand on that I then handled.</p>
               <p>Now there remains three things more.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, that in the day of judgment God will proceed according to his Law: So ſpeak and ſo do as thoſe that ſhall be judged by the Law.</p>
               <p>I ſay,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to his Law. Ioh. 12.48.</note>
                  <hi>In the day of judgment God will proceed with men according to his Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He will proceed according to his word written: therefore labour that your ſpeeches and actions may be ſuch that they may be agreeable to that, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. <hi>The word that I ſpeak to you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall judge you at that day.</hi> There is not a word that Chriſt ſpeaks, but it ſhall judge: he ſpeaks not in vain, he is the judge that ſpeaks. Now you know Chriſt ſpeaks two wayes.</p>
               <p>Either in himſelf, Or, by his Miniſters.</p>
               <p>In himſelf, and ſo either that that he ſpake when he was on earth in his own perſon; then all the words that he ſpake at that time are thoſe words by which he will judge men, as far as they concern morral actions, by thoſe words he will judge men at the great day: for he ſpake nothing but what was according to his Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:47453:170"/>Or elſe that which he ſpake in his Apoſtles immediatly, by a certain and infallible work of the Spirit, directing them to ſuch truth as that they could not err in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: now in this Chriſt ſtill ſpake in them. The ſame way Chriſt hath in ſpeaking to this day: therefore ſaith he, <hi>he that heareth you heareth me, and he that heareth me heareth him that ſent me.</hi> That which he ſpake to them, he ſpake in them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the Miniſters of the Goſpel. What we ſpeak as Miniſters, that is, as men that look to the direction of our Lord; for we are but Embaſſadours, and our words are ſo far of value and power as they are the ſpeeches of our Lord; and as we ſpeak the word of him whoſe Embaſſadours we are. Now I ſay look what the Miniſter thus ſpeaks as the Embaſſadour of Chriſt to the people, that Chriſt will confirm at the day of judgement. Now it will appear what we ſpeak as Embaſſadours, if we ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is agreeable to the text of Scripture rightly underſtood. Therefore mark it, whatſoever ſin we denounce the judgement of God againſt, and urge Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, it is the very rule that Chriſt will obſerve in judging men. Or elſe that ſpeech could not ſtand, <hi>what ye leaſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven, and what ye bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven,</hi> We bind, when by declaring of mens ſins, we denounce the judgment of God againſt ſuch ſins, and ſo pronounce men to ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wrath of God that remain in thoſe ſins: ſaith Chriſt, what you thus bind on earth <hi>ſhall be bound in heaven,</hi> that is, Gods act ſhall ratifie and confirm the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in heaven which we denounce here upon earth by vertue of this word.</p>
               <p>So when we come to diſtreſſed ſouls, and declare to them that they ſtand acquitted, and that by the Word of God; and ſo as Miniſters of the Goſpel by vertue of the truth revealed to us, declare that they are freed from the bond and guilt of their ſins, upon thoſe evidences of repentance that they manifeſt: I ſay, it is ratified in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Therefore you ſee there is no other way of proceeding, but look as Chriſts own words when he was upon the earth, ſo the ſame that are as his own words, that is, thoſe truths that are drawn from Chriſts truths have the ſame power upon the hearts and conſciences of men now to cammand them, and ſhall have after to judge them, as ever they had.</p>
               <p>But here it may be objected:
<note place="margin">Object.</note> it ſhould ſeem that all men ſhall not be judged by the Law, becauſe there are ſome men to whom the Law hath never been publiſhed: for what ſhall we ſay to a great part of the world, that have not yet received the Scriptures: we know that the Scriptures have not been publiſhed to a great part of the world: at this day there are many Heathens, many Pagans, that never had the Scriptures; therefore how ſhall they be jndged by the Law? except you ſay, that only thoſe ſhall be judged by it, that have been under the preaching of the Goſpel, and have had the help of the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>We anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> All men judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law. The Law not alike expreſſed to all.</note> that all man-kind, and every particular man is under the Law, only the Law is not alike expreſſed to them, it is not revealed alike to all ſorts. All have the Law, and the Law written too: but either it is written in the hearts of men, and ſo it is naturally in the hearts of all the Sons of men. Or elſe in the Scrptures, and ſo it is more clearly and evidently manifeſted in the Churches; but yet nevertheleſs in the hearts of men is the Law written, as much as ſhall be ſufficient to condemn them, as we ſee,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, they having not the Law are a Law to themſelves, and ſhew the effect of the Law written in their hearts, their conſciences accuſing, or excuſing them before God. The Gentiles that had not the Law,</hi> that is, not the Law written in the Scriptures; yet nevertheleſs <hi>they are a Law to themſelves,</hi> that is, they have certain principles, certain rules which remain in their natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, whereby they either <hi>accuſe or excuſe,</hi> as they do good or evil. And even theſe do ſhew that they have a Law that doth bind them, and ſhall condemn them; becauſe that when they would not obey even that Law, that is, even thoſe principles whereupon their conſciences wrought to accuſe or excuſe they were ſinners againſt the Law. So that we ſee no man ſhall be condemned at the day of judgement but by vertue of the Law: and however all have not the Scripture, yet they have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſcience, and the Law written there whereby it accuſeth, or excuſeth. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be true that things are not alike expreſly manifeſted to other people and to <pb n="327" facs="tcp:47453:170"/>us that have the Scriptures, yet they have ſo much manifeſted to them as ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them.</p>
               <p>And the reaſons of it are theſe why it muſt be ſo.</p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The Law is Gods ſcepter that he ruls by.</note>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the Law of God is Gods Scepter, whereby he governs and rules the Church, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.2. <hi>he ſhall bring the rod of thy power out of Sion. The rod of thy power,</hi> that is, the Scepter of thy power: that Scepter whereby thou doſt authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively and by power rule over the Churches: and what is this Scepter? It is the Word, as we ſhall ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3, 4. <hi>The Law ſhall come out of Sion.</hi> So then the Scepter, the rod of the word that is brought out of <hi>Sion,</hi> is the Law that comes out of <hi>Sion,</hi> the word of God, the Law of works and the Law of faith; for both theſe come out of <hi>Sion,</hi> the Law of works as far as it is the rule of life; and then the Law of Faith, both come in to rule the Church of God. Yea, this is the rod of Chriſts power, therefore he will manifeſt his power, and make all men ſubject to it. What power? There is a power of Chriſt, ſuch a power whereby he manifeſts his own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſoveraignty over all his creatures; over thoſe creatures that have not ſence, that have not reaſon; that is not this Law. But this power here, the Scepter of his power is that whereby he manifeſts his ſoveraignty, over reaſonable creatures, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men; therefore if they will not obey him, yet it ſhall be a <hi>Scepter of Iron</hi> to cruſh them in peeces. Therefore we ſee the very Angels themſelves that would not obey the directing commandement of God, the rule of life, in that particular place wherein they were; they found it a Scepter to cruſh them down; and they were caſt out of their place for their ſin. So likewiſe men; you ſee what the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of thoſe that periſhed in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> becauſe they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Word preached to them, but they would be lawleſs and diſobedient, or like men that would be under no Law, therefore they felt the force of it in the effect of the Law, in the fruit and penalty of the Law upon them. So I ſay Chriſt ſtill rules by power in the Law; in ſo much as that when the Law and command prevails not, then the puniſhment prevails; and they that will not ſubject themſelves to the Law, they ſhall be ſubdued under the puniſhment of the Law: that is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe the law is a rule.</note> it muſt be that Chriſt muſt proceed in judgement according to the Law; becauſe the Law is the rule. Now you know a rule is a note of diſtinction, it is that that being ſtraight &amp; right in it ſelf, which doth diſtinguiſh and diſcover things that are crooked. So the Law of Chriſt, it is a ſtraight rule in it ſelf: therefore whatſoever is contrary to it, is crooked and perverſe. And he will declare a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proceeding contrary to the unrighteouſneſs of men. How? by that rule that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers unrighteouſneſs. How ſhal Chriſt appear to be righteous in his Law, except he have a rule whereby unrighteouſneſs ſhall be diſcovered? Now that is diſcovered by the Law, the right rule, as it is, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 19. <hi>The ſtatutes of the Lord are right.</hi> Now <hi>rectum</hi> is <hi>index ſua oblique,</hi> that that not only declares its own excellency, but the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and obliquity of the contrary; therefore Chriſt ſhall proceed by the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſhall moſt clear his proceedings. For all the world will grant that that is a righteous rule; Therefore <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. when the Prophet would deal with men that were unrighteous, that would walk wilfully, and rebelliouſly againſt God, and then ſerve him with outward performances, <hi>wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord? and how before the high God? he hath ſhewed thee O man what is good,</hi> that is, <hi>to do juſtly, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> So that now, look what rule it is that ſhews what is good, that is the rule whereby the righteous Judge will proceed in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Now the Law ſhewes what is good, he hath ſhewed in his Law what is good: therefore he gives a brief ſum of the Law there, <hi>to walk humbly with God,</hi> that is the ſubſtance of the firſt Table of the Law: and to <hi>do juſtice,</hi> that is the ſubſtance of the ſecond Table of the Law; therefore ſaith he, <hi>he hath ſhewed thee what is good,</hi> this is a righteous rule, that diſcerns between good and evil. Look what that is that in the directions of life diſcerns between good and evil, that alſo in the proceeding of the Judge will clear his juſtice, either in rewarding the good, or in puniſhing the evil: therefore Chriſt muſt needs proceed according to his own Law in judgement. Thus the point is opened.</p>
               <p>Now a word or two for application.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:47453:171"/>Is it ſo that Chriſt will proceed in judgement by his own Law: then it ſerves in the firſt place for the juſt reproof of thoſe that neglect the Law,

                  </gap> is it a ſmall matter thus to ſlight the Law of God? the Word of God? why, you ſhall be judged by this: <hi>God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all men</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in that day according to my Goſpel, Rom.</hi> 2.16. not only that look what he hath ſpoken of the judgement ſhall prove true; but that in the judgement there ſhall be a proceeding proportionable and agreeable to what he hath ſpoken in that word that he calls his Goſpel. Therefore take heed how you ſlight this Word, it is a dangerous thing. Saith <hi>Solomon, Pro</hi> 13.13. <hi>he that deſpiſeth the cammandement ſhall periſh.</hi> He that deſpiſeth the commandement, when God hath revealed his will in matter of duty, for the direction of life (for that he calls the Commandement there) now if a man come to deſpiſe this, he ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly periſh ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When doth a man deſpiſe the commandement?</p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt. Anſw.</hi> To deſpiſe Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, what?</note>
               <p>You know to deſpiſe is when a man accounts a thing of no force; that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>deſpiſe not Propheſying.</hi> The word is, account it not a thing of nothing, account it not a ſlight matter.</p>
               <p>Now you know a man accounts a thing as a thing of nothing when he underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues it, when he gives it leſs acknowledgement then it is worthy of. As if a man come to buy a Jewel or a Pearl in the Market, and offer a ſleight and ſmall matter for it, he had as good bid nothing, the undervaluing of a commodity, is as the accounting of it worth nothing. In ſpiritual things when a man accounts the Law of God below it ſelf, that is, when he makes it not the chief direction of his life, then he accounts it as a thing of nothing, and deſpiſeth the Law.</p>
               <p>For either the Law is ſomewhat by Gods appointment, or not at all; if it be ſomewhat by Gods appointment, then it muſt have that place that God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, or elſe we give it not any eſteem according to the appointment of God, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own Fancy. I ſay if we give the Law eſteem according to Gods appointment, and by vertue of his Word, then we will give it the eſteem that God hath put upon it, that is, that it ſhall rule us in all our actions; and that it ſhall be our ſupream rule and guide, that a man ſhall account nothing elſe as the ſufficient direction of his life but the Law. Now when men come to this, that they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their own opinions before the Law; when they will prefer the opinion of other men before the Text of Scripture: when they prefer the cuſtomes of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rule of the Word. This is now to deſpiſe the Law, to make it as a thing of nothing. As you ſee it plain, it is ordinary in Scripture thus to tax men; as when they would account the traditions of men above the word; <hi>In vain they worſhip me,</hi> ſaith God, they become vanity themſelves for accounting the Law vain. So when they preferred the cuſtomes of their fore-fathers equal with the Law, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed the Law: this mixture, this joyning of other things with it, it is that that the Scripture calls <hi>the deſpiſing of the Law:</hi> Therefore it is a dangerous thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Law, is it not dangerous to deſpiſe the Judge? the Law ſhall be your Judge; that is, the rule whereby the Judge ſhall proceed.</p>
               <p>You know it is the aggravation of the fault of a Malefactor, that he not only tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth and ſinneth againſt the Laws of the Kingdome, but that he hath deſpiſed the Law: if he have been heard to ſpeak any ſpeeches to the contempt of the Law, this is a great aggravation of his ſin: how much more ſhall it be in the day of the Lord? Mens Lawes are imperfect, and therefore are revoked many times, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, and reverſed, but this Law of God is a perfect Law, and therefore it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be reverſed, it ſhall never be revoked nor altred. Now for a man to ſleight and neglect this in any point or degree it is a high contempt againſt God himſelf. That as a man might ſay of the Jews; when Chriſt came amongſt them, he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be their King; but being they would not take him for their King who (if they had taken him ſo) would have been their Saviour; therefore the time ſhal come that he will be their Judge and not their Saviour. So I ſay concerning the Law, the Law now publiſhed in the preaching of the Word; thoſe that will not now take it to be their counſellor ſhall find it then to be their condemner. If this be a harſh <pb n="329" facs="tcp:47453:171"/>ſaying, as they ſpeak of the command of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>This is a hard ſaying, who can bear it?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25.41.</note> If the Commandment of Chriſt concerning obedience ſeem harſh, then how harſh a ſaying ſhall that be, <hi>depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire?</hi> If it be ſo hard a thing to ſtand to the command of the Law, how hard a thing will it be to ſtand under the penalty and cenſure of the Law? Therefore I ſay, let men take heed, they ſhall find that even that very faith commanded that they have ſlighted, it ſhall prove heavy: they ſleighted it in obedience, it ſhall prove heavy in the judgement and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Admonition to obſerve the Law: 1. For directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> it may ſerve for admonition, and ſo to teach us how to carry our ſelves. If the Law of God be the rule whereby he will judge us. Firſt then look to the law for direction, look to the precept, to the command of God for the directing of our lives. I know not how, but I am ſure, by the malice of Satan it is come into the world, into the Church, that ſome men (upon pretence of giving the doctrin of juſtification by grace, and by the merits of Chriſt the full vertue of it) would put men off from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as if therefore we were not to be under the direction of the Law, becauſe we are freed from the Law by Chriſt. They diſtinguiſh not between the penalty of the Law, &amp; the command of the Law: the ſame Chriſt that hath freed us from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law (as many as are in him by faith) hath ſubjected us to the command of the Law, and that in his own perſon; and not only ſo but in his own precept. Therefore he became an expounder of the Law, <hi>Math.</hi> 5. and ſhewes that <hi>the Law is ſpiritual,</hi> that it is a thing that binds the conſcience, and would have all men look to the direction of the Law. And the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> then whom no man ever ſpake more fully of juſtification by Faith, yet the ſame Apoſtle would not have the Law as it is a direction of life aboliſhed; but would have men ſo much the more new, as by new arguments and incouragements they are ſet upon the duties of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>But I ſay, ſuch is the malice of Satan as to draw men upon ſuch grounds as theſe are (not rightly underſtood by them) to I know not what courſe of Libertiniſme; and though they pretend a courſe of obedience to the Law, yet they will not do it as to the Law. Whereas it is evident that the Law is appointed as a curb to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to cure and purge out that. And therefore it is for men to be wiſer then God, to ground their actions upon another principle and ground, then God grounds them.</p>
               <p>Indeed the ſervants of God do not the actions of obedience ſimply, becauſe of the Law written in the Scriptures, but <hi>they have the Law written in their hearts too,</hi> ſo the Spirit of God is a Spirit that guides them according to the Law, and diſpoſeth them to thoſe actions that are ſutable to the Law: yet he never excludes, or puts them from the Law, from ſubjection to the Law in point of obedience. I ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore errours creep in amongſt men to dream of a liherty from obedience, when the Scripture ſpeaks of a liberty from the Law but in other ſences, not in matter of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. For tryal.</note> let men look to the Law for tryal too, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>If a man think he is ſomething when he is nothing, he deceiveth himſelf:</hi> but <hi>let every man try himſelf, and prove his own work.</hi> Let him prove his own work: by what ſhall he prove it? Why, by the Law. By the Law here we mean the whole Word of God, the Law of works and of Faith. I ſay let him prove his works by this Law, by the written Word of God. Therefore if a man would now know how it ſhall go with him at the day of judgement, let him begin to judge himſelf by this rule before-hand, Let him reaſon thus, either I ſhall ſtand as condemned, or acquitted: if as condemned it is by the Law, therefore (mark) ſo far as I go on in any ſin againſt any known truth of God, ſo far I ſtand in the eſtate of a condemned perſon.</p>
               <p>Therefore conſider beloved, you do exceedingly wrong your ſelves, becauſe you do not look thus upon you actions; you look not upon them as upon things that are tranſgreſſions againſt the Law that ſhall judge you: and that therefore if the Law of God condemn ſuch actions now, then thou ſtandeſt as a condemned perſon by vertue of that Law.</p>
               <p>Alas, durſt men go on without repentance in any courſe of ſin, if they took them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:47453:172"/>
as condemned men (in truth) by vertue of the Law? There is not any word that thou ſpeakeſt, but as ſoon as it is ſpoken, thou ſtandeſt in the eſtate of a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, and if thou intereſt not thy ſelf in Chriſt, and come not in, certainly the Law will paſs upon it. Therefore ſeriouſly conſider of this, that there is no evil or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſin that you go on in, but if the Law condemn it, Chriſt will condemn it too at the day of judgement. Therefore you muſt before-hand condemn your ſelves <hi>that you may not be condemned of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.32. <hi>Judge your ſelves, and you ſhall not be judged of the Lord,</hi> But yet this remaines a truth ſtill, that he that doth not condemn himſelf, that doth not take off his ſins by unfeigned repentance, he ſtands a condemned perſon before the Lord, becauſe he ſtands condemned in the Law.</p>
               <p>Therefore I beſeech you beloved plead not any priviledg in Chriſt; (I ſpeak this the rather becauſe men uſe the Goſpel to their own deſtruction, I ſay plead not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge by Chriſt) if you go on in the allowance of any ſin; <hi>ſhall we continue in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. So I ſay when a man will come and plead, I believe, and I hope to be ſaved by Faith, yet nevertheleſs it may be thou art a ſwearer, a vain ſpender of thy time, it may be thou art a neglecter of the duties of the worſhip of God, and of thy duties towards men, &amp;c. thou art a man in ſome conſtant courſe, in ſome way of ſin or other: I ſay this ſhewes thee to ſtand as a condemned man, and in the ſtate of a condemned man. I ſay not that ſuch a man ſhall infallibly be damned, becauſe <hi>God may give him repentance that he may come out of the ſnare of the divel;</hi> but we ſay he ſtands for the preſent in the ſtate of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned perſon, and he is condemned by the Law, and remains ſo till this be reverſed by repentance, till he have ſued out this pardon by interreſting himſelf in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore conſider this ſeriouſly, that there is not that ſin in thought that thou committeſt, not any act of ſin whatſoever; but becauſe of that ſin thou art condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Law, therefore thou ſtandeſt in the ſtate of a condemned perſon for that ſin: therefore there muſt be ſomewhat done now to take off this. I ſay a man may have a pardon, and yet if he ſue it not out it is of no force, or uſe to him; ſo let no man talk he is a juſtified perſon by Chriſt, but thou muſt ſue out this pardon. Therefore we are taught, upon daily ſuing, to renew our daily prayers for the pardon of ſin. There muſt be a daily ſuing out of the pardon, and that upon this ground: ſo there muſt be a daily condemning of thy ſelf, and of ſin in thy ſelf. Alas what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a world of men and women? (I ſpeak not of thoſe that are without, we leave them, they are condemned in the ſight of all the world, but) we ſpeak of thoſe that are now in the Church; of thoſe that go ſomewhat forward in the profeſſion of Religion, and hope and are perſwaded that they are in a good caſe, and yet have little care to ſet things right between God and themſelves; but though ſuch and ſuch actions be condemned by the Law, yet they hope that there is a general mercy that will pardon it, though they never ſue out their pardon. I ſay the Law ſhall paſs on thee till thou do that that concerns thee, to be releaſed from the rigour and ſentence of the Law, <hi>he that confeſſeth and forſakes his ſins ſhall find mercy, Prov.</hi> 28.13. This muſt be done, and ſo in other particulars; the Scripture is large in theſe things, and ſomewhat muſt be done by us to ſue out this pardon: that though there be an act of pardon in God, a free act, yet there muſt ſomewhat be done by us to ſue out this pardon for our ſelves, or elſe we ſtand in the ſtate of condemned perſons.</p>
               <p>But theſe things I leave to your meditations, and ſo I fall upon the next point, which I will briefly touch, and that is no more but thus: that ſince there ſhall be a proceeding in the day of judgement by the Law, wherein mens actions and words ſhall be brought to account; therefore,<lb/>
                  <hi>The conſideration of the day of judgement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> The conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the day of Judgment ſhould move to holineſs.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhould be an effectual inſentive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to ſtir men to a holy, and conſcionable walking in this life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So ſpeak and ſo do, as thoſe that ſhall be judged by ſuch a Law.</hi> Since the Apoſtle makes this uſe of it to direct us both in our ſpeeches, and actions, I ſay we may learn hence, that the conſideration of the judgement to come, wherein Chriſt will proceed <pb n="331" facs="tcp:47453:172"/>according to the Law, it ſhould be an effectual means to make us careful of holineſs and new obedience, <hi>ſo to ſpeak and ſo to do</hi> as thoſe whoſe words and actions muſt be brought to judgement. Now that this is ſo, and is intended ſo, and hath prevailed with the ſervants of God, I might prove many wayes. I will rank and order the proof under theſe heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will ſhew you how this hath been a means to draw ſome to the wayes, and duties of obedience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how it hath been the way to direct, and guide others in thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how it hath confirmed and ſtrengthned them in thoſe actions: and by this we ſhall ſee what it ſhould be to us.</p>
               <p>Frſt,
<note place="margin">1 It hath drawn ſome to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> we ſhall ſee how it hath been a way to draw men to the actions of obedience. How are men drawn to be obedient? Firſt, they are drawn from their own ſins, from their own evil wayes. Now the conſideration of the judgment to come, it hath prevailed, and been uſed for this purpoſe, to draw men from their ſins. As we ſee in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.9.</note> 11. ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> to the young man; <hi>Rejoyce now in thy youth;</hi> it is Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically ſpoken, <hi>but now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that for theſe things thou ſhalt come to judgment.</hi> That is, let this cool thy courage, and moderate thy exceſſive joy, know that thou ſhalt come to judgment. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.30. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>God calls upon all men, every where to repent: becauſe he hath appointed a time in which he will judge the world.</hi> He calls men to repentance by this argument, becauſe he will judge the world, and hath appointed a time for it. You know repentance it is nothing elſe but to forſake our former evils: Now he calls them to repentance, becauſe he will judge the world, and ſo calls as he draws men from ſin.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 To forſake the world.</note> he draws men from the world to God by this. You know that even world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections hinder men from coming to the obedience of Chriſt: <hi>therefore,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">Phil. 3.7.</note> 
                  <hi>I account all as dung,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.7. Why? becauſe he looked for a Reſurrection, his thoughts were upon that: and ſaith he verſ 20. <hi>our converſation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Therefore we are drawn to this holy courſe of obedience, becauſe we look for Chriſt from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>And then again in the diſpoſing of men to new obedience:
<note place="margin">2 Diſpoſing the heart to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> there is not only a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of ſin, and the world, but beſides that, there is an inward qualifying of the heart: Now the heart is qualifyed; that is, it is fitted by certaine qualities to the ſervice of God,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.10.</note> by the help of this conſideration, as we ſee <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.10. <hi>You ſee the ſum of all, fear God, and keep his Commandements: for God will bring every work to judgment:</hi> Upon this ground he minds them to <hi>fear God,</hi> which is that quality that diſpoſeth a man to keep his Commandements; he perſwades them upon this ground: <hi>becauſe God will bring every work to judgement. Let us have grace in our hearts to ſerve the Lord with reverenee and fear,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> Heb.</hi> 12. I ſay, this qualifies and diſpoſeth us to the ſervice of God; and we are fitted to ſeek, and to ſerve God with due reverence and fear, by the conſideration of the judgment to come, that he is a <hi>God</hi> that <hi>will judge the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 14<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>
                  </note> So in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. he would have the Nations to fear God, <hi>becauſe he will come to judge the world.</hi> So much for the firſt thing: you ſee the conſideration of the judgment to come, prepares men to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 It quickens to actions of obedience.</note> beſides that, it quickens them to all the actions of obedience, when they are in it: when now a man is in a good courſe, and his heart is prepared to ſeek God aright, yet nevertheleſs there are many temptations, and many corruptions, that ſometimes indiſpoſe, and unfit his heart again. Now then the conſideration of the judgment to come, it ſerves to revive and quicken the heart to theſe actions, too.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of a mans particular Calling.</p>
               <note place="margin">1 Of particular calling.</note>
               <p>Thoſe of his general Calling.</p>
               <p>For his particular calling, the Apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy,</hi> and charged him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and Chriſt, <hi>that ſhall judge the quick and the dead,</hi> to be faithful in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery; He would have him faithful in his miniſtery upon this ground, becauſe <pb n="332" facs="tcp:47453:173"/>Chriſt will <hi>come with his elect Angels, to judge the quick and the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo for our general Calling,
<note place="margin">2 General cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> 
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 24. <hi>I deſire to keep a good conſcience before God and men</hi> upon this ground; becauſe I beleeve the Reſurrection, and ſo a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come. So in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Seeing all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs?</hi> Why? all theſe things ſhall be diſſolved, therefore we had need to be other manner of perſons then we are, to be better kind of perſons then we have been. Thus, I ſay, the ſervants of God quicken themſelves to more holineſs, upon conſideration of the judgment to come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 It confirms in obedience.</note> they have been confirmed, and ſtrengthened upon this ground: for when the heart of man is brought to this plight, that he muſt be ever chearful, and lively, and active in the ſervice of God: yet there are many diſcouragements, and temptations to draw him out of the way again; that it may be he may fall, if he have not ſomewhat to ſupport him, and hold him up: therefore the conſideration of the judgment to come, it hath kept the hearts of Gods ſervants in a good frame, when they have been in it. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>be conſtant, and immovable, alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. As if he had ſaid, You know this, that there will a time come when it will appear that you ſerve not God in vain, therefore for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be conſtant in the good you are in: <hi>Hold faſt that thou haſt till I come,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia, and let no man take thy crown, Rev.</hi> 3.21. Chriſt will come, and it is but holding faſt a-while, and then the Church ſhall have a crown; and the ſervants of God ſhall have a crown of glory, an abundant recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of all that they have done in the ſervice of God, therefore <hi>hold faſt.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. the Apoſtle exhorts co patience, becauſe they ſhould meet with many perſecutions, and oppoſitions, <hi>be patient, for the coming of the Lord draws neer.</hi> Bear the injuries that you ſuffer for the preſent, and the indignities, and the unkind uſage of men, for the coming of the Lord draws neer, when you ſhall have a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful harveſt: ſo he goes on illuſtrating this by a compariſon taken from a Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that waits for a harveſt, and then he ſhall have a plentiful crop, and increaſe, for all his pains in Winter, and in ſeed time: ſo ſaith he, the Lord will come, and then you ſhall have a plentiful increaſe.</p>
               <p>A word or two for the Uſe of this.</p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Shewing the cauſe of the worlds propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Saints deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</note>
               <p>Since this is the Uſe that the ſervants of God have made, and that we ſhould make of the Judgment to come, therefore to be more careful in the duties of obedience, and holineſs, <hi>ſo to ſpeak, and ſo to doe, as thoſe that ſhall be judged.</hi> It firſt ſhewes the cauſe of the diſcouragements of Gods ſervants, and the prophaneneſs of the world, is, becauſe they perfectly beleeve not the judgment to come. The hearts of Gods ſervants would not droup ſo, they would not be ſo faint, ſo dejected, and diſcouraged, if they beleeved that there were ſuch a judgment to come, wherein Chriſt will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly recompence all their ſorrows, and labours, wherein he will bring his reward with him plentifully.</p>
               <p>Again, the wicked world would not be ſo prophane as they are: drunkards, and ſwearers, and Sabbath-breakers, and all ſorts of wicked perſons, they would not give themſelves ſo to ſin as they do, if in truth, they did perfectly beleeve there were a judgment to come; when all their words, and actions, their company, their time, and every thing ſhall be brought to account. I ſay, the cauſe of all prohaneneſs is this, here it begins; men beleeve not the judgment to come. The Apoſtles were troubled with theſe kind of ſcoffers; <hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> So they hardened themſelves upon the obſervation of the continuance of the ſeaſons upon the face of the earth in like manner from the beginning.
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> Well, ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>God is not ſlack, as men count ſlackneſs, but is patient, and forbearing, that men may repent;</hi> but at the laſt he will come, and <hi>come with flaming ſire.</hi> So, this is certain, whatſoever you think, and <hi>put the evil day far off from you,</hi> yet there is a judgment coming, wherein all your actions, and affections, and ſpeeches, and your whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſhall be ſcanned, and brought to the rules of this law that you have deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:47453:173"/>Therefore let men take heed, and know it is a device of Satan to harden their hearts; either to think that the law is a dead letter, I mean in reſpect of the directing uſe of it, that it is of no uſe to direct them; it is a device of Satan to put them off: for they ſhall find that that law will judge them, that now ſhould direct them. And then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for men to think that there ſhall be no Judgment, or not ſuch proceedings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law: this is a trick of the Divel, to keep men in prophaneneſs, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſecondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. To ſtrengthen faith of the judgment.</note> if we would <hi>grow up in holineſs in the fear of God:</hi> Let us prefect, and ſtrengthen our faith in aſſenting to this truth, that there is ſuch a judgment to come, wherein our words, and actions, and all ſhall be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Therefore <hi>ſo ſpeak, and ſo do, as thoſe that ſhall be judged.</hi> Thou art now in company, and thou ſpeakeſt amongſt men; but thy words are with God, <hi>they are written</hi> in thy conſcience, as it is in <hi>Jeremy, upon the Table of thy heart,</hi> there they are written: the words that thou haſt for gotten ſeven years agoe, it may be twenty years agoe, and never tookeſt a courſe to get them blotted out by repentance, there they are written, and theſe words ſhall be brought to judgment, and ſo many actions as thou haſt neglected, therefore look to it.</p>
               <p>Firſt bewail thoſe words and actions paſt, as things that elſe will come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if thou judge not thy ſelf before-hand.</p>
               <p>And then again for the time to come, ſet on a reſolution to walk daily, as one that may die every day, and then ſhall be brought to judgment. Therefore judge thy ſelf daily, renew thy Covenant, ſettle thy peace on a right ground daily, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſs in the fear of God daily, as one that expecteſt a Judgment. Saint <hi>Jude</hi> condemns thoſe that <hi>feaſted without fear.</hi> They were at their Tables, companying, and feaſting,
<note place="margin">Jerome</note> as men without fear. S. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf, that whatſoever he was doing, he had a fearful apprehenſion of the day of Judgment; Alwayes, ſaith he, whether I eate or drink, or whatſoever I do, I here the Trumpet, and the voyce of the Arch-Angel ſaying, <hi>Ariſe ye dead, and come to judgment.</hi> Well, I ſay, do thou ſo, let this be thy ſerious thought, and do it not ſlightly; but think that this may be thy laſt word, and thou muſt be brought to judgment for it: this may be thy laſt opportunity, and thy laſt action, and thou muſt be brought to judgment for that. Do things in this manner, <hi>as thoſe that ſo ſpeak and ſo do, that they muſt be judged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wouldeſt thou be content to have thy oaths brought before Chriſt in judgment? if not, take heed of ſwearing: for it is judged already by the law: therefore judg, and condemn thy ſins in thy ſelf, and forſake them, that thou maiſt find mercy. Wouldeſt thou be found guilty of Sabbath-breaking at the day of Judgment? if not repent of thy former guilt, and be more conſcionable of ſanctifying the Sabbath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And ſo I may ſay of every ſin. Wouldeſt thou be found an Uſurer? a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver? unrighteous in any courſe? a ſcoffer? a prophane perſon? Wouldeſt thou appear before Chriſt ſo in judgment? If not, repent of thy guilt in this kind, <hi>that thy ſins may be done away, when the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of Chriſt.</hi> And in the mean time ſet thy ſelf in a contrary courſe to that thou haſt been: do as one that would have Death find thee in a good courſe: for <hi>as death leaves thee, judgment ſhall find thee.</hi> If Death find the in a ſtate of repentance, in a courſe of reformation of thy evil wayes, judgment ſhall find thee ſo too. Let Death therefore find thee as a man intereſt in Chriſt, as a man humbling thy ſoul, abhoring thy ſelf for thy former ſins: let Death find thee as a man reforming all thoſe evils that are condemned in the Word, and in thy conſcience. Now when I ſay, let Death find the ſo, I mean, ſet about it preſently: for how ſoon Death may ſet upon thee thou knoweſt not, whether to night or no: and if this be not now done, if thou ſet not about it now, it may be too late, thou ſhalt have no more time, therefore do that now, and go on conſtantly after, knowing that Death may find thee every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore it is that God keeps from us (upon purpoſe, as it were) the certain knowledge of the time of Death, that we may be alwayes prepared for Death.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He latter part of this Chapter, from the 12 Verſe to the end, is ſpent in a grave and powerful dehortation of the faithful, from ſecurity in ſin: againſt which the Apoſtle uſeth ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry arguments. That which he preſſeth moſt is drawn from the ſeveral ends to which ſin and righteouſneſs doth lead men: The end of <hi>ſin is death, verſe</hi> 21. therefore that is not to be ſerved: The end of <hi>righteonſneſs is life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, verſe</hi> 22. therefore that is to be imbraced. Becauſe there is now difference in the manner of the proceeding of theſe two ends, Death coming from ſin as from the meritorious cauſe, but life from Righteouſneſs, another manner of way: therefore the Apoſtle adds this Epilogue and Concluſion in the laſt Verſe, plainly ſhewing, and more clearly expreſſing the manner of them both: <hi>For the wages</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>

<note place="margin">Meaning of the words.</note> becauſe victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als was that that the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours gave their ſouldiers as <hi>wages,</hi> in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their ſervice: but thence the word extends to ſignifie any other wages or <hi>Salary</hi> whatſoever. <hi>The wages of ſin [is death]</hi> by death here is ſignified and meant, both temporal and eternal death, eſpecially eternal death; for it is oppoſed to eternal life in the next clauſe of the ſentence, therefore that is that that is principally meant, <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> that is eternal death. This for the expoſition of the terms.</p>
               <p>The point to be obſerved from this firſt part of the Text is this; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>Death is due to ſin, as wages to one that earns it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſuch a one wages is due in ſtrict juſtice,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> Death due to ſin as wages.</note> if a man have a hired ſervant, he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a free gift on him if he will, if he will not he may chooſe; but his ſtipend or his <hi>wages</hi> he muſt pay him unleſs he will be unjuſt, for it is the price of his work, and ſo is due to him that he cannot without injuſtice with-hold it. After ſuch a manner is death due to ſin: the very demerit of the work of ſin requires it, as being eraned. God is as juſt in inflicting death upon ſinners for their ſins, as any man is in paying his labourer or hired ſervant their <hi>wages:</hi> for this is the general plain ſcope of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles words here.</p>
               <p>So in the beginning God appointed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. where he told <hi>Adam</hi> concerning the forbidden fruit, <hi>in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhallt die the death.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, when thou ſinneſt, death muſt be thy <hi>wages.</hi> The ſame is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Ezck.</hi> 18.20. where it is ſaid, <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die,</hi> expreſſing the <hi>wages</hi> of ſin, it is death, that is the recompence of ſin: if ſin have his due then death muſt follow. So the Apoſtle had ſhewed before in this Epiſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>that by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, ſo death went over all men, for as much as all men had ſinned.</hi> All had ſinned, therefore all are payed with death. And Saint <hi>James</hi> ſhews the conſequence and connexion between theſe two, the work and the <hi>wages,</hi> he tels us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. that <hi>when ſin hath conceived it bringeth forth death.</hi> All theſe places are evidences that death by Gods ordinance, by his appointment is the due of ſin, as due to it, even as <hi>wages</hi> is to a hired ſervant or one that hath earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>What death is it that is due to ſin?</p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt. Anſw.</hi> What death due to ſin:</note>
               <p>Both temporal and eternal death. I ſay both deaths; concerning both which the truth is to be cleared from ſome doubts. It was the Pelagians errour to think that man ſhould have died a natural death, though he had never ſinned: ſo they thought that the natural,
<note place="margin">1. Temporal.</note> temporal, bodily death, was not the wages of ſin. Contrary to the Apoſtle in the place I ſpeak of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. where he makes that death that goes over all men, (which muſt needs be natural death) to enter by ſin, <hi>ſin brought in death;</hi> no ſin, no death at all.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </note> when God told <hi>Adam</hi> in the day that he eat the forbidden fruit he ſhould <hi>die the death,</hi> he meant not temporal death there, as the event ſhewes, for ſuch a death was not inflicted upon <hi>Adam</hi> in the day that he ſinned; for after he <pb n="337" facs="tcp:47453:175"/>ſinned he lived ſtill in the world naturally, he continued living many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>I anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> How <hi>Adam</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a natural death, as ſoon as he ſinned.</note> not withſtanding all this <hi>Adam</hi> may be ſaid to die a natural death as ſoon as he ſinned, becauſe by the guilt of his ſin he then preſently became ſubject to it, and God ſtraight-way denounced upon him the ſentence of death, therefore it may be ſaid, he ſtraight-way dyed. As a condemned perſon is called a dead man though he be reſpited for a time.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Meſſengers and Sergeants of death preſently took hold of him, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted him for ſin, as hunger and thirſt, and cold, and diſeaſes, daily waſting of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural moyſture to the quenching of life. Indeed God ſuffered him that the ſentence was not preſently executed, ſo to commend his own patience, and to give to <hi>Adam</hi> occaſion of ſalvation, the promiſe of Chriſt being after made, and he called to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by that means to attain a better life by Chriſt, then he loſt by ſin.</p>
               <p>It is objected again,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </note> Chriſt redeemed us from all ſin, and all the puniſhment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but he did not redeem us from bodily death, from temporal death: for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful we ſee die ſtill even as others do: therefore it is concluded by ſome that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death is not the <hi>wages of ſin;</hi> for then when we were free from ſin by Chriſt, we ſhould be freed from that.</p>
               <p>Our anſwer to this is,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw. How</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans freed from temporal death.</note> that Chriſt hath freed all his elect, not only from eternal, but even from temporal death, though not from both in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>From temporal death firſt, in hope of which the Apoſtle ſpeaking, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. ſaith, <hi>The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death,</hi> meaning temporal death, at laſt then it ſhall be deſtroyed, <hi>mortal ſhall put on immortality,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks: but in the mean time it is deſtroyed in hope, though it remain indeed, and muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, even of the faithful in this life.</p>
               <p>Howbeit to them Chriſt hath changed the nature of it,
<note place="margin">Chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death, why.</note> and now they no longer undergo it as <hi>the wages of ſin,</hi> but for other cauſes. As firſt, the exerciſe of their graces, their faith, and hope, and patience, and the reſt: all theſe are exerciſed (as in other afflictions ſo even) in the death of Gods Children.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the total removal and riddance of the reliques of ſin from which they are not freed in this life: but when they die, then all ſin is taken away: for as at the firſt ſin brought death into the world, ſo to the faithful now death carries it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>Thirdly their entrance into heaven, and to be at <hi>home with the Lord,</hi> from whom we are abſent as long as we are at home in theſe bodies.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simile.</hi>
                  </note> to prepare their bodies for renuing at the laſt day, that is done by death: for as a decayed Image or ſtatue muſt firſt be broken that it may be new caſt, ſo theſe bodies of ours muſt be broken by death, that they may be caſt into a new mould of immortality at the general reſurrection. But here as ſome ſin remains, ſo death remains, though we be in Chriſt, yet we are ſtill in that eſtate wherein, <hi>it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to all men once to die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus even temporal death is left to the Children of God to be undergone, before they come to heaven. It is left to them I ſay, and that juſtly in reſpect of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of ſin, yet they undergo it no other way, but for their own good and benefit. However temporal death in its own nature to an unbeleever, is <hi>the wages of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as temporal,
<note place="margin">2 Eternal death.</note> ſo eternal death: for when God told man that in the day he finned <hi>he ſhould die the death,</hi> he meant not only temporal but eternal death, he meant that principally, as I ſhewed before, in that the Apoſtle oppoſeth it to eternal life in the next clauſe of the ſentence: Now Chriſt hath freed all beleevers actually from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death.</p>
               <p>But how eternal death ſhould be <hi>the wages of ſin,</hi> may be doubted: becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the work and the <hi>wages</hi> there muſt be ſome proportion, that ſeems not to be between ſin and eternal death: for ſin is a finite, a temporal thing committed in a ſhort time, and that death is eternal. Now to puniſha temporal fault, with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal puniſhment, it ſeems that it is to make the puniſhment to exceed the fault, and that is againſt juſtice.</p>
               <p>But for an anſwer to this doubt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> we muſt know, that however ſin conſidered in the <pb n="338" facs="tcp:47453:176"/>act,
<note place="margin">Sin infinite three wayes. 1 In reſpect of the object.</note> and as it is a tranſcient action it is finite, yet in other reſpects it is infinite, and that in a threefold conſideration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in reſpect of the object againſt whom it is committed: for being the offence of an infinite Majeſty, it deſerves an infinite puniſhment: for we know oftences are reckoned of for their greatneſs, according as the greatneſs of the perſon is, againſt whom they are committed. If he that clips the Kings coyn, or deface the Kings Arms, or counterfeit the broad Seal of <hi>England,</hi> or the Princes privie Seal, ought to die as a traytor, becauſe this diſgrace tends to the perſon of the Prince, much more ought he that violates the law of God, die, the firſt and ſecond death too, becauſe it tends to the defacing of the Image, and the diſgracing of the perſon of God himſelf, who is contemned and diſhonoured in every ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 The ſubject.</note> ſin is infinite in reſpect of the ſubject wherein it is, the ſoul of man. Seeing the ſoul is immortal, and of an everlaſting ſubſtance, and that the guilt of ſin, and the blot together ſtain the ſoul, as a crimſon, and skarlet die upon wooll: and can no more be ſevered from the ſoul then the ſpots from the Leopard: it remains as the ſoul is eternal, and as that is everlaſting, ſo ſin is infinite in durance, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and deſerves an infinite <hi>wages,</hi> and puniſhment, which is eternal death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 The ſinners deſire.</note> it is infinite alſo in reſpect of the tie, between the deſire, and endeavour of an impenitent ſinner: for his deſire is to walk on ſtill in ſin, and except God cut off the line of life, never to give over ſinning: but he would run on infinitely, <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin,</hi> even <hi>with greedineſs.</hi> And it is reaſon that as God accepts <hi>the will for the deed</hi> in godlineſs, ſo he ſhould puniſh the will for the deed in wickedneſs: if we ſin according to our eternity in our will and purpoſe to ſin, God will puniſh us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his eternity: it is juſt, that they that would never be without ſin (if they might have their own will) ſhould never be without puniſhment. Thus we ſee eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death is <hi>the wages of ſin,</hi> though ſin be committed in a moment, though it be a tranſcient action in it ſelf, yet it is juſt with God to give it the wages of eternal death. So you ſee Death, both temporal and eternal is <hi>the wages of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come to the Uſe of the point, being thus declared.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Original luſt a ſin.</note> it teacheth us (contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal luſt, and concupiſcence in the regenerate is a ſin: for how elſe ſhould God be juſt in inflicting temporal death upon infants that are regenerate? actual ſins they have none; and if they have no original ſin neither, then God ſhould inflict <hi>the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin,</hi> where there were no ſin, which connot be, becauſe there is no iniquity with God. Therefore certain it is, that after regeneration, this original luſt, though the guilt of it be taken away,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baſile</hi>
                  </note> yet as ſin it remains, the ſubſtance of it ſtill remains, and will as long as we live in this world. For it is in us, as it is well compared, as the Ivy is in the wall, which having taken root ſo twines, and incorporates it ſelf, that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be quite rooted out till the wall be taken down: ſo, till body and ſoul be taken a ſunder by death, there will be no total riddance of Original corruption, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of our nature, it is ſtill in us, as appears by the temporal death, even of the beſt Saints, of thoſe that are moſt ſanctified in this life, it ſhews there is remainders of corruption in them ſtill: for if there were not ſin, there would not be <hi>the wages of ſin:</hi> there would not be death, if there were not ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Confuration, no ſin in it ſelf venial.</note> the Uſe of it is to take away a fond Popiſh diſtinction of <hi>mortal,</hi> and <hi>venial</hi> ſin: they teach ſome ſins to be venial; that is, ſuch ſins as in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſerve not death, whereas the Apoſtle here ſpeaking of all ſin in general, he ſaith, <hi>the wages</hi> thereof <hi>is death.</hi> And how can it be otherwiſe when all <hi>ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> and Saint <hi>John</hi> defines it, and all tranſgreſſion of the Law deſerves,
<note place="margin">1 Joh 3.5.</note> and is worthy of the curſe, which is both the firſt and <hi>ſecond death,</hi> for <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are witten in the book of the Law to do them.</hi> There is no ſin then, but it is worthy of death, therefore there is no ſuch venial ſin as they dream of.</p>
               <p>We deny not,
<note place="margin">Sins mortal, and venial how.</note> but that ſome ſins are <hi>venial,</hi> and ſome <hi>mortal</hi> in another ſence, not in reſpect of the nature of the ſin, but of the eſtate of the perſon in whom the ſins are; ſo we ſay all the ſins of the Elect are <hi>venial,</hi> becauſe they either are or ſhall be pardoned. And all the ſins of reprobate perſons are <hi>mortal,</hi> becauſe they ſhall <pb n="339" facs="tcp:47453:176"/>never be pardoned. It is the mercy of God (and not from the nature of the ſins) that makes them <hi>venial:</hi> for otherwiſe every ſin in it ſelf conſidered (be it never ſo ſmall) is <hi>mortal:</hi> for if it work according to its own nature, it works death of body and ſoul.</p>
               <p>It is a fooliſh exception that they bring againſt it, that thus we make all ſins equal; and that we bring in with the Stoicks, a parity of ſin, becauſe we ſay all are mortal. It is a fooliſh cavil: for it is as if one ſhould argue, becauſe the Mouſe, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, are both living creatures, that therefore they are both of equal bigneſs: Though all ſins be <hi>mortal,</hi> they are not all equal, ſome are greater, and ſome are leſſer, according as they are extended, and aggravated by time, and place, and perſon, and ſundry other circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe one ſhould be drowned in the middeſt of the Sea, and another in a ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low pond: in reſpect of death all were one, both are drowned: but yet there is great difference in reſpect of the place, for depth, and danger. So there is great difference in this, though the leaſt ſin in its own nature be <hi>mortal,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it is death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,

In ſpectacles of death to ſee the heinouſneſs of ſin.</note> ſeeing <hi>the wages of ſin is death,</hi> it ſhould teach us what Uſe to make of death, being preſented before our eyes at ſuch times as this: hereby we ſhould call to remembrance the grievouſneſs of ſin that brought it into the world: by the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>wages</hi> we ſhould be put in mind of the unhappy ſervice. Had there not been ſin, there would have been no death: upon the death of the ſoul came in the death of the body: firſt the ſoul died in forſaking God, and then the body died being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of the ſoul: the ſoul forſook God willingly; therefore it was compelled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly to forſake the body. This is the manner how death came into the world by ſin, therefore death muſt put out ſin.</p>
               <p>That houſholder, when he ſaw tares grow among his wheat, he ſaid to his ſervants, <hi>the envious man hath done this:</hi> So whenſoever thou feeſt Death ſeize upon any, ſay to thy ſelf, ſin hath done this: this is <hi>the wages of ſin:</hi> and if man had never ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; we ſhould have ſeen no ſuch thing.</p>

To deterre us from ſin.</note> this muſt deter us from ſin, ſince it gives ſuch <hi>wages.</hi> Indeed the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſin is for the moſt part (if not alwayes) to promiſe better, but it is deceitful, and this is <hi>the wages</hi> it payes thee. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

At the firſt ſin may be pleaſing, but remember the end, the end of it is death. Like to a freſh River that runs into the ſalt Sea, the ſtream is ſweet,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Similles.</hi>
                  </note> but it ends in brackiſhneſs and bitterneſs. Or like to <hi>Nebuchadnezzars Image, the head</hi> was <hi>gold,</hi> but <hi>the feet were of clay.</hi> Or ſin may be compared to that Feaſt that <hi>Abſalom</hi> made for <hi>Amnon;</hi> there was great chear and jollity, and mirth for a while, but all cloſed in Death, in bloudſhed, and murther. It deales with men, as <hi>Laban</hi> dealt with <hi>Jacob;</hi> he entertains him at the firſt with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, but uſed him hardly at the laſt.

               <p>This ſhould keep us from every ſin, though it ſeems never ſo pleaſing, and never ſo ſweet to us, remembring that the worſt is ſtill to come. We read that when the people ſaw that <hi>Saul</hi> forbad them to eat,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.</note> though they were exceeding hungry, yet not one of them durſt touch the honey for the curſe, though they ſaw it: ſo the pleaſures of ſin may drop as honey before our eyes, but we muſt not adventure to taſte of them, becauſe they are curſed fruit, and becauſe of <hi>the wages</hi> that will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

To be humble and thankful.</note> for this point, ſo many of us as have repented, and have already left the ſervice of ſin, we muſt hence learn, as to be humbled in our ſelves, conſidering what danger and miſery we have eſcaped; ſo to be more thankful to Chriſt, that hath freed us from ſo wretched <hi>wages</hi> due to our ſins, and that by taking the whole puniſhment upon himſelf. For we muſt know (beloved) that the beſt of us, <hi>by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are children of wrath, as well as others:</hi> the ſtipend that we have earned is eternal death, and ſurely it hath been payed to us, nothing could have kept it from us, but only the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, coming between Gods juſtice and us. Think we then if we can, what miſery it is that we have eſcaped (as many of us, I mean as be in the ſtate of grace) we have eſcaped death, the hurt of temporal death, we have eſcaped eternal death. What is that? a ſeparation from the bleſſed preſence, and glory of God: deſtruction of body and ſoul for ever, unutterable torments, company with the divel and his angels, and the rout of reprobates: darkneſs, blacker, and thicker then that of Egypt, <hi>Weeping and wayling, and gnaſhing of teeth</hi> in the infernal lake; <hi>that worm that never dies, and the fire that never goeth out.</hi> This is <hi>the wages of</hi> all <hi>ſin:</hi> and that it is not rendred to all ſin, and to all ſinners, the cauſe is only this, that the payment hath been already exacted of Chriſt in the behalf of all true beleevers; therefore in their own perſons they are diſcharged: how infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are we bound in thankfulneſs to him? and how careful ſhould we be to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it? reſolving never to return to the ſervice of ſin again, but to make it our whole ſtudy, that we may pleaſe and honour ſuch a Redeemer, that hath redeemed us from ſuch miſery as this; that we may pleaſe him: for we had deſerved eternal death, as well as others, and he hath not only freed us from that, that we had moſt worthily deſerved, but moſt freely alſo beſtowed that upon us, that we could never deſerve; for ſo it followes in the next point.<lb/>
                  <hi>The gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is the ſecond thing to be conſidered, the reward of the ſervice of God. You have heard of the reward, <hi>the wages of ſin.</hi> Now the reward of the ſervice of God is eternal life,
<note place="margin">Life twofold. 1 Natural. 2 Spiritual.</note> it is called life. There is a twofold life belongs to men.</p>
               <p>The one is natural, and is common to all, good and bad in this world.</p>
               <p>The other ſpiritual, proper to the faithful, begun by the union of God, and the ſoul, and maintained by the <hi>bond of the ſpirit:</hi> and this life hath three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
               <p>The firſt is in this life unto death;
<note place="margin">1 In this life.</note> and it begins when we begin to beleeve and repent, and come to a ſaving knowledge of God, and of his Son Jeſus Chriſt: as it is ſaid, <hi>This is eternal life to know thee to be the very God, and whom thou haſt ſent Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 17.5.2 In deathy</note> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree is from our death to our reſurrection: for in that time our ſouls being freed from our bodies, are withal free from all ſin, original, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 Afterth e Reſurrection.</note> after the Reſurrection, when body and ſoul ſhall be reunited, we ſhall have immediate communion and fellowſhip with God, and ſo enjoy a more perfect and bleſſed life then ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>It is called eternal life,
<note place="margin">A thing eternal three wayes.</note> becauſe it ſhall never end; For a thing is ſaid to be eternal three wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, which hath neither beginning, nor end, ſo God alone is eternal, and none but he.</p>
               <p>Secondly, which hath no beginning, and yet ſhall have an end: ſo Gods decree is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, 
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:47453:177"/>
for it never had a beginning: yet when all things decreed are fulfilled, it ſhall have an end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, which hath a beginning, but never ſhall have end, and ſo the life of Gods Saints had a beginning, as all created things have, but it ſhall never have an end; and this eternal life, it is called here.<lb/>
                  <hi>The gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe we cannot deſerve it, but it is given, and beſtowed on us freely for Chriſt. So then the point of obſervation from the latter part of the words is this; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>Our ſalvation it is the free gift of God, given us only for the merits of Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> Salvation the feee gift of God.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For obſerve I beſeech you the Apoſtles words, when he had ſaid, <hi>The wages of ſin is death,</hi> he doth not add, and ſay, but <hi>the wages of righteouſneſs is eternal life,</hi> but he calls that <hi>the gift of God.</hi> To make us underſtand ſaith <hi>Damaſcene</hi> that God brings us to eternal life meerly for his own mercy, not for our merits, or elſe ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apoſtle would have made the latter part of the ſentence, anſwerable to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>But here perhaps ſome may ask why <hi>eternal life</hi> ſhould not be the <hi>wages</hi> of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi>
                  </note> as well as death <hi>the wages of ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe there is not the ſame reaſon between ſin and righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>For firſt, ſin is our own, it merits it, but righteouſneſs is none of our own, it is the holy Ghoſts and it is due to God.</p>
               <p>Then again ſin is perfectly evil, and ſo it deſerves death, but our righteouſneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent is not perfectly good, it is imperfect in this life, and nothing that is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good can merit (as wages) eternal life: therefore the Apoſtle makes ſuch a manifeſt difference between them, he calls death, <hi>the wages of ſin, but eternal life, the gift of God,</hi> it is the free gift of God through Chriſt. Indeed <hi>eternal life</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, many times in Scripture is called a reward. But there is a reward of mercy as well as of juſtice. Nay God is ſaid ſometimes to reward his children in juſtice. How is that? Though the reward come originally from mercy, yet accidentally it comes to be juſtice, thus, becauſe God hath tyed himſelf by promiſe to reward, now promiſe is debt from a juſt man.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
                  </note> Thus the Lord may be accounted a debtor. How? ſaith Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as a promiſer, if he had not promiſed eternal life, otherwiſe he ows us nothing at all, much leſs <hi>eternal life</hi> which is ſo great a thing.</p>
               <p>Yet it may be doubted,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi>
                  </note> how <hi>eternal life is the free gift of God,</hi> ſeeing it is given for the merits of Chriſt, as it is here expreſt <hi>the gift of God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> that is, for the merits of Chriſt; now a man that gives a thing upon merit, he gives it not freely.</p>
               <p>I anſwer it is free in reſpect of us;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi>

               <p>If it be replyed, Chriſts merits are made ours, and we merit in him, and ſo it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be free. I anſwer, this reaſon were of force if we our ſelves could procure the merits of Chriſt for us,
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.</note> but that we could not do, but that alſo was of free gift, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his onely begotten Son, that he that beleeves in him ſhould not periſh:</hi> he gave him freely, of free gift; ſo that though <hi>eternal life</hi> be due to us by the merits of Chriſt, yet it is <hi>the free gift of God.</hi> I will ſtand no longer in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the truth of the Doctrine.

               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. Confutation of merit. Rom. 8.</note> it ſerves to confute our adverſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the point of merit. They look for heaven and <hi>eternal life</hi> as wages, we ſee the Apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us otherwiſe, that <hi>eternal life</hi> is not given in that manner, but another manner of way; It is not given as wages, it is <hi>the free gift of God.</hi> And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. he ſaith, that <hi>the ſufferings of this life is not worthy of the glory that ſhall be revealed:</hi> all our ſufferings, all our works they are not worthy of the glory of God, we connot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly merit them. This was the conſtant Doctrine of the primitive Church: that a good life when we are juſtified, and an eternal life when we are glorified; they all grant that all that is good in us is the gift of God; that eternal life is not a retribution <pb n="342" facs="tcp:47453:178"/>to our works but the free gift of God. When God crowns our merits, he crowns nothing elſe but his own free gift: theſe and many other ſentences we find among the ancient Fathers, plainly convincing our adverſaries, that in this point they ſwerve not only from Scripture, but from all ſound antiquity.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. To humble us.</note> then to come to our ſelves, this ſhould humble us in reſpect of our own deſervings; do all the good thou canſt, take heed it do not puff thee up, think not to merit heaven, alas thou canſt not do it: for <hi>what is it to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> (as it is ſaid in <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>that thou art righteous?</hi> Thy well doing extends not to him, thou canſt do him no good, therefore thou canſt look for nothing at his hands ſince thou canſt do him no good: but all that thou doſt in his ſervice, it is not for his but for thy good, yet he commands thee, and thou art bound to do it, but all thou canſt do is no more then thou art bound to do. Therefore when thou haſt done all that thou canſt, acknowledge thy ſelf to bean <hi>unprofitable ſervant,</hi> and thou haſt <hi>done no more then thy duty.</hi> If thou haſt many good works, yet thou haſt more ſin; and the leaſt ſin of thine in the rigour of juſtice, will deprive thee of thy intereſt in God. Therefore thy appeal muſt be to the throne of grace, and thy only plea muſt be that of the Publican, every one of us, <hi>God be merciful to me a ſinner;</hi> when we have done all we can, it muſt be mercy, and not any merit of ours that muſt bring us to heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Comfort.</note> here is comfort for the children of God, in that this ineſtimable treaſure of <hi>eternal life</hi> is not committed to our keeping, but God hath it in his keeping. It is his <hi>giſt,</hi> it is not committed to the rotten box of our merits, then we could have no certainty of it, the devil would eaſily pick the Lock; yea without picking he would ſhake in pieces the crazy joynts of the beſt work we do; he would ſteal it from us, and take it away, and deprive us of this excellent benefit: but the Lord hath dealt better for us, he hath kept it in his own hands, he hath laid it up in the Cabinet of his own mercy and love that never fails: for <hi>with everlaſting mercy he hath compaſſion on us, Iſa.</hi> 54. <hi>he loves us with an everlaſting love. It is his mercy that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not: and whom he loves he loves to the end.</hi> It is laid up in the mercy of God, he will have it his gift; leſt we ſhould keep it, and it ſhould be loſt, he hath reſerved it in his own hands. Therefore in temptations when they drive us to doubt of our attaining of <hi>eternal life,</hi> let us caſt our eye upon the keeper of it, it is the Lord, he is wary to diſcern, and faithful to beſtow it: therefore let us comfort our ſelves and ſay every one of us as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have truſted, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him againſt that day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4. Thankfulneſs.</note> ſeeing <hi>eternal life is the free gift of God,</hi> it muſt make us thankful to him for it; which we ſhould never do, if we deſerved it; doth a maſter thank his ſervant for doing his duty? So, if we did think heaven were our due, we ſhould never be thankful for it. Pride is a great enemy to thankfulneſs; therefore the way is to humble our ſelves, and to conſider that we deſerve no good thing at Gods hands, then we will take this great benefit at Gods hands moſt thankfully. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we conſider, it is all that God requires of us, as he ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will hear thee and deliver thee,</hi> and what ſhalt thou do? <hi>Thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> Glorifying God, and being thankful to him, is all the tribute we are to pay to this our royal Lord; and ſhall we deny him this? It is a ſmall benefit that is not worth thanks; We ſet eternal life at too low a rate, if we forget to be thankful. There was never a precious Jewel afforded ſo cheap as <hi>eternal life</hi> for our thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>If we did know what it were to want it, we would give ten thouſand worlds ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then be without it. Therefore as <hi>Naamans</hi> ſervants ſaid to him concerning his waſhing in <hi>Jordan, if the Prophet had commanded thee a greater thing, would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not have done it?</hi> So if God had commanded us a great matter for <hi>eternal life</hi> we ſhould have done it; how much more, when he ſaith take it, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; be but thankful.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:47453:178"/>Thus I have deſcribed to you this twofold ſervice, <hi>the wages of ſin,</hi> that is <hi>death,</hi> temporal, eternal: The ſervice of <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> the wages, and reward of that, <hi>eternal life,</hi> which is not wages <hi>but the gift of God.</hi> So that I may now ſay to you as <hi>Moſes</hi> did to <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 30.19. <hi>Behold I have ſet before you life and death, curſing and bleſſing.</hi> Therefore chooſe not curſing, chuſe not ſin, nor <hi>the wages</hi> thereof, it is death: but <hi>chooſe life, that you and your ſeed may live.</hi> If we follow ſin, the <hi>wages</hi> will be death; if we apply our ſelves to righteouſneſs in the ſervice of God, our reward ſhall be <hi>eternal life,</hi> not that we deſerve it, but that it is the pleaſure of our heavenly Father to beſtow it upon us, <hi>For the wages of ſin is death, and the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>

<note place="margin">Iſa. 45 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Righteouſneſs and ſtrength:</hi> So the Prophet, <hi>Surely, ſhall one ſay, in the Lord, have I Righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> There are two things likewiſe in a Chriſtian, which are of eminent ſufficiency, in order to his ſalvation, and his poſſeſſion of the <hi>Glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> purchaſed by this Saviour; <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience;</hi> often ſpoken of ſeverally, and in particular, but withal jointly and together, as might be manifeſted by the allegations of Scripture; as, <hi>be not ſlothful, but be ye fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of them, that by Faith and Patience inherit the promiſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Concerning theſe two which are ſo eminent in the called of God, and are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <pb n="344" facs="tcp:47453:180"/>in order to their poſſeſſion of the <hi>purchaſed inheritance;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Analyſis of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> as the Scripture abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly treateth of, ſo moſt frequently in the Epiſtle, and more eſpecially, in the 10, 11, and 12. Chapters.</p>
               <p>In the latter end of the tenth Chapt. you have the Apoſtle there, firſt dogmatically handling the doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> as the neceſſary means to attain everlaſting life, and as the principall conducement to the poſſeſſion of glory, and to the ſaving of the ſoul; <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the beginning of the eleventh Chapter, he ſheweth the abſolute neceſſity of <hi>Faith,</hi> to an acceptable walking, and well-pleaſing of God; <hi>For without faith</hi> (verſ 6.) <hi>it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> and the whole Chapter is further ſpent in ſetting down the glorious Examples, of <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the reſt of <hi>the Elders,</hi> eminent for then <hi>Faith, by which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they received a good report:</hi> All whom, did worthily in their dayes, and are now become famous to poſterity; ſtanding out to this day, alſo many living voyces, calling upon us to <hi>become followers of them,</hi> that we might together with them, be at length made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the <hi>glorious inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle, have ſpoken much to this purpoſe, goeth on, to that other grace we ſpake of, ſo neceſſary to the conſtitution of a Chriſtian, and to the enabling of him to a well and faithful managing of his Calling, and condition, and that is <hi>Patience.</hi> Propounded by way of exhortation in the firſt part of this twelfth Chapter; and urged with reſpect to the neceſſary uſes of it, both concerning duties done, and afflictions to be endured, in the verſes following.</p>
               <p>Firſt with reſpect to duties, which the Apoſtle propoundeth under the Metaphor of <hi>running in a race</hi> (for ſuch is the courſe of a Chriſtian life; which the Saints of God are called to the finiſhing of) <hi>Let us run the race that is ſet before us; and run with Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is urged with reſpect to ſufferings, and that of two ſorts, from men, from God.</p>
               <p>From men, from whom the faithful are to make account of ſufferings in divers kinds, in ſhame and deriſion, in proud and inſolent contradictions, and (according to their power and opportunity) in bloudy perſecutions, <hi>You have not yet reſiſted unto bloud,</hi> verſ. 4.</p>
               <p>From God: and here the Apoſtle is more large, urging his exhortation to <hi>Patience,</hi> and a quiet applying of our ſelves to God, according to all the ſtates and conditions he is pleaſed to bring us unto, and according to all his ſeveral adminiſtrations towards us; very ſtrongly, labouring to faſten it in the hearts of the Saints of God, as <hi>a nayle in a ſure place;</hi> firſt alledging that ſame paſſage of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Proverbs; <hi>My ſon, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord.</hi> And then he further ſtrengthneth his exhortation by invincible arguments. (I do but touch upon theſe things, haſt ening on to the main thing I intend; only deſiring to give you a plain, and brief Analaſis of this Scripture, with the context of it.) The Apoſtle (I ſay) driveth on this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by ſtrength of argument;</p>
               <p>And that firſt of all, by propounding to the godly, that whereas the Lord is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to exerciſe them with afflictions; to make them drink many times of a cup of bitterneſs, yet they have reaſon to be quiet and patient, becauſe this way the Lord giveth a proof of his love to his children: and thoſe that are wiſe and godly, will be glad (they have reaſon ſo to be) that God ſhould take ſuch a courſe with them, as whereby he may give them a demonſtration of his dear love and affection: Now herein the Lord evidenceth his love and affection to his people; for all the afflictions and chaſtiſements that he exerciſeth them withall, flow from his love, and are as fruits thereof, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth,</hi> verſ. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he propoundeth it to their conſideration as a courſe wherein the Lord giveth an evidence of his peoples adoption: <hi>For, what ſon is he whom the Father chaſteneth not? But if ye be without chaſtiſement, whereof all his children are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, then are ye baſtards and not ſons,</hi> verſ. 78. Now the godly ſhould be glad, to have the Lord take ſuch a courſe with them, and ſo to order out his adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <pb n="345" facs="tcp:47453:180"/>concerning them, as that they may have ſome comfortable evidence to their ſouls, that they are his adopted ones, and ſuch as he will one day acknowledge for to be his children.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, and that which more concerneth our preſent purpoſe: the Apoſtle urgeth his exhortation by a compariſon that he frameth, between God, <hi>the Father of ſpirits,</hi> and men, that are <hi>fathers of our fleſh: we have had fathers of our fleſh, and they verily, for a few dayes chaſtened us, and we gave them reverence; ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of ſpirits and live? they chaſtened us for their pleaſure, but He, for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holineſs.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſee the compariſon is laid out in ſeveral particulars; and the preheminency, the advantage of the compariſon is given to God; for ſo is the ſcope and intent of the Text.</p>
               <p>It lieth thus briefly; Firſt, <hi>We have had fathers of our fleſh, and God is the Father of Spirits;</hi> if we have been contented to undergo the diſcipline of our earthly fathers, much more have we reaſon quietly and patiently to ſubmit our ſelves to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>the Father of our ſpirits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; <hi>They for a few dayes chaſtened us, and we gave them reverence;</hi> it is but a few dayes neither, that <hi>the Father of ſpirits</hi> meaneth to keep us under his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: ſuppoſe it be all our time, and perhaps it ſhall be ſo, yet all that is, but the time of our minority; and therefore if we have been content to ſubmit to our earthly parents, their diſcipline for a few dayes, <hi>ſhall we not much more be in ſubjection to the Father of ſpirits,</hi> to his chaſtiſement, though it be for our life-time? for the diſproportion is infinitely greater between the time of this life, compared with the ſtate of maturity and ripe age which the Saints ſhall come to hereafter; and the time of our minority and child-hood, compared with the ſtate of full age and man-hood in this life; for alas, how ſhort are our dayes! <hi>they are ſpent, even as a tale that is told.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But laſtly, that the Apoſtle might over-power the ſpirits of the godly, and quiet their minds, and make them compoſe themſelves to a patient waiting upon God, and a willing ſubmiſſion to whatſoever condition he ſhall bring them into; <hi>Our earthly parents</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>according to their pleaſure,</hi> and many times in the ſtrength of paſſion, and with over-much unadviſedneſs and heat of bloud, not ſo much reſpecting the weak condition of their children, <hi>chaſtened us; but he,</hi> that is, our heavenly Father, <hi>the Father of ſpirits, for our profit;</hi> and what profit? <hi>that we might be partakers of his holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an Argument (I conceive) very ſutable to the occaſion of our meeting together at this time, in regard of thoſe whom more eſpecially, and neerly it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth, the Parents of this deceaſed young Gentleman; whom the Lord is pleaſed now deeply to afflict, and to reach out to them a bitter Cup; I ſhall endeavour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſpeak ſomewhat in this Argument: And though it concerns them in a more ſpecial manner; yet, it is a meditation, that concerns us all to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of; and ſuch a one, as if we belong to God, and that the Lord hath a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to bring to heaven, we ſhall have occaſion in our time, to make often uſe of.</p>
               <p>Paſſing over therefore other things, let us come to conſider of this latter part of the verſe; and of the latter part of the compariſon here framed by the Apoſtle, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the ſtrengthning of his main Argument, whereby he urgeth his exhortation, to the patient bearing of thoſe Afflictions that God ſhall be pleaſed to exerciſe us withall: <hi>Our earthly Parents for a few dayes chaſtened us after their own pleaſure, but He, the Father of our ſpirits, for our profit, that he might make us a partaker of his holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the words themſelves, we have to conſider theſe particulars: And the main pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of our diſcourſe for the preſent (letting paſſe the reſt) ſhall be theſe ſeverals.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we are to take knowledge of this point in the general, viz. <hi>That God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is graciouſly ſet to procure, and further the good and profit of his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, and more particularly, <hi>That in all the afflictions and chaſtiſments he bringeth upon his people, his eye and aim is at their good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly; <hi>The great profit, and benefit that God aimeth at, and intendeth to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all his fatherly adminiſtrations, eſpecially of caſtigation, is, that be might make them partaker of his holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:47453:181"/>I begin with the firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 1. God is pleaſed to ſet himſelf to procure the profit of his people.</note> and the more general point. You ſee the Text importeth it plain enough, that God Almighty is graciouſly ſet, for to procure, and promote, and further the good, and benefit, and profit of his people, of ſuch as fear his name, of ſuch as he is pleaſed to receive for his own: his heart (I ſay) is ſet upon them to do them good, he is ſtudious of their profit, he hath a due reſpect to their benefit, in all his dealings and adminiſtrations to them.</p>
               <p>Next to his own glory, (which is deareſt to him of all things elſe, and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too, for that is better then ſalvation and eternal happineſs. But I ſay next to his own glory) and the glory of his beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt; the main thing that he aimeth at, is, that he might make his people happy with him; and that they might be every way profited, and advantaged both in ſoul and body; and furthered to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſs.</p>
               <p>This will appear to us,
<note place="margin">Proved by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</note> if we conſider firſt,</p>
               <p>The ordinances of God, which he hath appointed in order to his peoples good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we conſider his commandements and impoſitions. And,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if we conſider all his various adminiſtrations toward them.</p>
               <p>All which will clearly manifeſt to us, that Gods aim in all, is, at the profit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his people.</p>
               <p>I ſhall touch but upon ſome particulars, and on them neither I ſhall but onely glance; becauſe I would keep my ſelf within the compaſs of the time.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 In his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in the Church.</note> conſider the Lords ordinances that he hath provided for his people, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them out to give attendance upon; they are all with reſpect to his peoples profit, and an eye to that. As for inſtance;</p>
               <p>That great Ordinance which God hath ſet up in his Church,
<note place="margin">1 The preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word. Act. 26.18.</note> namely, that of preaching, and diſpenſing of the ſacred miſteries of the Goſpel; it is with reſpect to his peoples profit; <hi>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and an inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith in Chriſt;</hi> That they might be brought <hi>into the fellowſhip of this miſtery,</hi> and be inriched with all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that all Scripture</hi> (which this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Preaching is to be converſant about, that Scripture which we are to break abroad among you this way) <hi>it is profitable;</hi> Profitable <hi>for Doctrine, for reproof, for inſtruction, for correction; and it will make the man of God perfect;</hi> So profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as that it is able to perfect a man, to make him <hi>wiſe to ſalvation;</hi> and we need no more wiſdom.</p>
               <p>The like might I ſpeak concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper;
<note place="margin">2 The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Supper.</note> It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of God with an eye to his peoples benefit, that they may come to be made partakers of that profitable <hi>fleſh and bloud</hi> (for ſo I may juſtly call it) <hi>of the Lord Jeſus, It is not the bloud of Bulls and of Goats;</hi> it is not the bloud of all the men in the world, that is profitable for ſuch purpoſes, as the pacifying of the wrath of God, the quenching of the flames of his diſpleaſure, <hi>the purging of the conſcience from dead works;</hi> of thoſe we may ſay as <hi>David</hi> in another caſe, <hi>what profit is there in my bloud?</hi> But there is profit in the bloud of Chriſt, and with reſpect to that, this ordinance is provided in the Church, that the people of God, attending thereon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his inſtitution may come to be made partakers of the vertue and benefit thereof; having the remiſſion of their ſins, thereby ſealed up to their conſciences, through faith in that bloud.</p>
               <p>The like Inſtance might I give of Prayer,
<note place="margin">3 Prayer.</note> and the reſt of thoſe holy ordinances which God hath ſet up in his Church; but I will name no more, leſt I be prevented. Onely by the way conſider this: Moſt unworthily do we deal with God, with Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with the Sacrament, and with all theſe holy ordinances, if ſo be we do not reap profit,
<note place="margin">Unprofitable living under the ordinances, a taking the name of God in vain.</note> and benefit by them: A ſoul that liveth unprofitably under the diſpenſation of theſe, doth but <hi>take the name of God in vain:</hi> Every time we come to hear the Word preached, and to attend upon the Sacrament, and go away from them, no better then we were when we came to them, we <hi>take the name of God in vain;</hi> and deal unworthily with theſe holy things: They are given to profit with, and we ſhall but encreaſe our own guiltineſs, if we be not profited by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:47453:181"/>But I ſay (brethren) this is that which God hath reſpect unto in all his proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his people, in the Inſtitution of all his ordinances; their profit and benefit: and when he findeth any ordinance that is not for the benefit of his people, though they be of his own inſtitution, yet he takes them away; therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaking concerning the Moſaical Rites and inſtitutions of the Ceremonial Law, he calleth them unprofitable, and <hi>beggerly rudiments,</hi> and ſo God himſelf coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them, and for their unprofitableneſs, there was a gracious diſanulment of them.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially and above all,
<note place="margin">4 Sending of Chriſt into the world in our nature.</note> this will be moſt apparant if we caſt our eyes upon the Lord Jeſus, who is indeed the ſubſtance of our preaching; and of our receiving the Sacrament, and of all the ordinances of God, and of all his promiſes: it is with reſpect to our profit that the Lord hath been pleaſed to ordain him, both in reſpect of his perſon, and the conſtitution of that; and in reſpect of his offices, and all his fatherly adminiſtrations concerning him: a gracious reſpect he hath had in all to the profit of his Church, as might appear in the ſeveral particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A body haſt thou prepared for me,</hi> (ſaith he in the <hi>Pſalm</hi>) why? That Chriſt might be the more profitable to his people; fitted thereby to converſe with, and to communicate himſelf unto them. <hi>The word was made fleſh,</hi> and therefore <hi>made fleſh that he might dwel among us;</hi> that there might be a meet cohabitation with him.</p>
               <p>And as this was the reſpect God had in his incarnation, ſo it was in all his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. What was the reaſon that <hi>he was acquainted with ſorrows and griefs,</hi> and miſeries, both from God and men? but that he might be the more for our profit; that we might have a <hi>merciful High Prieſt,</hi> that he might the better know from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the way to commiſerate, and compaſſionate his people in their diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Yea in his death, in his reſurrection, in his aſcention, in his preferment at Gods right hand; in all theſe adminiſtrations of God the Father concerning his Son, he had a gracious reſpect to the good and profit, and benefit of his people.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly,
<note place="margin">2 In his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</note> conſider all the appointments of God, his injunctions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to his people; he doth in all aim at their profit; as it is in <hi>Deut. All theſe things I command thee for thy good.</hi> The Lord requireth nothing at his peoples hands but it is for their profit:
<note place="margin">Deut: 10: 13.</note> He calleth upon us to believe, it is that we might have the profit of his word and promiſes. He calleth upon us to repent and to leave our ſinful wayes,
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.29.</note> 
                  <hi>if thine eye off end thee pluck it out, if thine hand offend thee cut it off, for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members ſhould periſh, and not that they whole body ſhould be caſt into hell;</hi> he hath an aim at our profit, we think hard of it (as we are naturally apt to do, through a deep affection we bear to our baſe luſts) that God ſhould come ſo near to us and deal ſo ſtrictly with us, and to command us to pluck out our eyes, and cut off our hands, that is, to part with our deareſt corruptions; Alas (my brethren) if God ſaw that it were good for us, that it were for our profit to keep our luſts, he would not take away one of them from us, but we ſhould have them (as I may ſay) with all his heart: but he knoweth that as they are not for his glory, ſo they are not for our profit, he ſeeth that there is not any good to be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by our retaining of them; therefore it is (I ſay) that he is ſo ſtrict in his impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, that he ſo often calleth upon his people to repent and to caſt away their ſins.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly,
<note place="margin">3. In his ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> conſider all the adminiſtrations of God to his people, and we ſhall ſee that in them all, he hath a reſpect to their profit. As for inſtance: he is pleaſed to ſuffer ſin and corruption to remain in his ſervants all the while they are in this life,
<note place="margin">1 Permitting ſin to remain.</note> he could wholly take it away and free them from it, even in this world: But he knowes that it is for their profit to ſuffer theſe In-mates, theſe <hi>Cananites</hi> to remain that they <hi>may be as pricks in their eyes and thornes in their ſides;</hi> to make them the more weary of the world, and the more deſirous of heaven.</p>
               <p>He is pleaſed many times to ſuffer his people to have ſin not only tyrannizing and
<note place="margin">2. To prevail.</note> uſurping, but prevailing againſt them; but it is that thereby they may attain to a greater degree of humiliation. He ſuffereth them ſometimes to fall, for this very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he might exalt them. He is pleaſed to permit the Devil to buffet them, and to <pb n="348" facs="tcp:47453:182"/>uſe them very hardly: were it not for their profit, he would tie him up in Hell, and give him no ſuch leave as this; but (as he ſaid to Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>leſt they ſhould be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above meaſure, the meſſenger of Satan is ſent to buffet them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea the Lords with-holding of his ſpiritual comforts;
<note place="margin">3. Withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</note> his deſerting of his people, the hiding of his face from them, the withdrawing of thoſe ſweet and gracious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of himſelf unto them, it is all with reſpect to their profit; that they may be taught the more to prize the comforts of his ſpirit, and to walk more worthy of them when they do enjoy them.</p>
               <p>He is pleaſed ſometime to ſuſpend his anſwering of their prayers,
<note place="margin">4. Suſpending his anſwer to their prayers.</note> and to hold them long in the expectation of the return of their requeſts: it is for their profit; that they may he thereby ſtirred up to ply <hi>the Throne of grace</hi> with more frequent and earneſt prayers; that ſo the greater their adventure is (as I may ſay) the greater their return may be: It being in this caſe with them as it is with Merchants, the greater adventure they ſend forth, and the longer their ſhip is out, the greater and more advantageous is the return.</p>
               <p>Many times again,
<note place="margin">5. Denying their particular ſuites.</note> he is pleaſed not only to ſuſpend his anſwer to their prayers, but to deny the granting of his peoples requeſt in the very kind they ſue for: But even in this too he hath reſpect to their profit: he heareth them (as one well ſaid) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their profit, though not according to their wills: ſo he delt with <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning his requeſt of entring into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again the Lord is pleaſed to keep his people many times in a low condition, and in mean eſtate, to put them into bare commons and hard paſtures, while others are grazing in full meddows; it is with reſpect to their profit, to teach them the more to depend upon him, to enable them the better to live by Faith.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">6. Deprives them of their deareſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</note> for this purpoſe he takes from his ſervants dear bleſſings, the Wife from the Husband, the Children from the Parents; as we ſee verified this day in this place concerning our friends here, the mournful ſurvivers and attendants upon this ſad occaſion; but in theſe adminiſtrations he intendeth his peoples profit, as we may ſee in the caſe of <hi>Job;</hi> the Lord takes away all his children, but (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ye have heard of the patience of Job,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">James 5.11.</note> 
                  <hi>and have ſeen the end of the Lord:</hi> he was no looſer in the concluſion, but God returned at length all into his boſome again, nay dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>In a word, for this very purpoſe it is, even for their profit (for alas it is not Gods own benefit he ſeeks after but his peoples in all his adminiſtrations) that they live, that they do, that they ſuffer, that they die, their death is in order to their gain, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make ſome application of this, and ſo to proceed.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Uſe of exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> let us here take occaſion, as many as are the called of God according to his purpoſe; and implanted in this glorious relation of children to a father; let us learn to advance his name; and <hi>according to his name let his praiſe be in all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of the Saints.</hi> Truly (as <hi>Moſes</hi>) ſaid once) <hi>their Rock is not as our Rock:</hi> So may we ſay, other fathers are not as this Father, our Father is ſet for the good and profit of his children. The devil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a father, ſo our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>you are of your father the devil;</hi> he hath children, and he ſtudieth nothing ſo much as that they may live all their dayes in pleaſure; ſtriving to lead his followers altogether in pleaſant paths: But alas he hath no aim at their profit, it is their loſs he ſeeks; and therefore at laſt he makes them pay full dear for all their pleaſure and content. But now God, he is a wiſe Father, and in all his diſpenſations to his children (though they ſeem for the preſent unpleaſant) he hath an aim at their profit. Let this be for his praiſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us labour to beleeve this, that God in all his dealings and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards us, hath an eye to our profit. How hard ſoever the condition be that he putteth us into, if he take from us <hi>the deſire of our eyes,</hi> the delight of our hearts, our liberties, our eſtates, our children; yet be perſwaded of this, that God doth it for my good and benefit.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, labour to reap the fruit and benefit that God aimeth at and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and would have us receive from all his adminiſtrations. When we are called
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:47453:182"/>
together to give attendance upon the preaching of the Word; then think, what am I come hither for? is it not for my profit? would God have me trifle out my time? ſurely the Lord would never have ſingled out a day of ſeven for himſelf, but that he might likewiſe make his people partaker of ſpiritual advantages, and heavenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits; and therefore I loſe a day, and never hear well, except I hear to profit. And thus what I ſay of this Ordinance, I might likewiſe ſpeak of the reſt before named. And ſo for this preſent occaſion; the Lord now you ſee is pleaſed to call us to <hi>the houſe of mourning.</hi> Was it think ye? the purpoſe of God, that we ſhould meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether here in a cuſtomary complemental manner, to do things in a common garb, only to eat together, and drink together? No, the Lord calleth us to <hi>a houſe of mourning,</hi> for our profit, that we might <hi>conſider the end of all men, and that we that are living, might lay the thing to heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for you that are in preſent diſtreſs, in regard of this particular affliction; reckon upon this, that God hath done this for your profit; labour ye therefore to reap the fruit of it; be not ſo much poring upon the affliction, and altogether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the bitterneſs of the cup; but follow on after the profit and benefit that God intendeth you thereby. And let every one labour to improve all adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God to this purpoſe; that as he in them all intendeth our good, ſo let us purſue after the benefit.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> let it inſtruct us further concerning our duty; even to walk worthy of ſuch a God as namy of us as are in relation to him, as children to a Father, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to a Maſler; How ſhould this firſt of all, win us over to ſuch a Father, to ſuch a Maſter? and to make it our higheſt ambition, to be the people of ſuch a God, the children of ſuch a Father, that is devoted to the profit and advantage of his children and ſervants? This is the gracious goodneſs of God, he takes pleaſure in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of his ſervants: their profit is his pleaſure: Let us therefore walk worthy of ſuch a Father, of ſuch a Maſter; And ſeeing he intendeth our profit, and that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profit him, let us labour <hi>to walk in all well-pleaſing:</hi> We cannot profit him, let us labour to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, here is a word of inſtruction for Miniſters, we ſhould in this caſe (as thoſe that are intruſted with the ſacred ordinances of God) labour to put on the mind of God (ſo the Apoſtle, we have, ſaith he, <hi>the mind of Chriſt.</hi>) We in the courſe of our Miniſtery, as God aimeth at his peoples profit, ſo ſhould we, not aim at our own praiſe, and at our profiting by them, but that we might profit their ſouls. O bleſſed preaching, when people profit by our preaching, when they are by that increaſed in knowledg, in love, in faith, in every grace. Such a Preacher was Saint <hi>Paul: I pleaſe all men</hi> (ſaith he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ult. but how?) <hi>not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi> Oh labour to preach profitably, that our people may thrive under our miniſtery. This is that which God aimeth at, and this is that which we ſhould aim at too.</p>
               <p>And thus I have done with the firſt, and more general propoſition ariſing from the words of the Text. I come now to the ſecond and more particular thing that we are to conſider hence; and that is, that,<lb/>
                  <hi>As God graciouſly ſetteth himſelf to procure his peoples profit in all his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Propoſ. 2.</hi> Gods aim in afflicting his children, is their profit.</note> ſo this is that he aimeth at, in all the afflictions and chaſtiſements, he exerciſeth them withall.</hi>

               <p>It is no pleaſure for him to be laſhing and whipping his people, to hold them under ſuch ſharp diſcipline, it is for the profit of the children: ſo the Text expreſſeth it, but he for our profit.</p>
               <p>Which firſt of all implieth, that afflictions and chaſtiſements are a means condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the profit of thoſe that undergo them: A point plain in the Text, and the Scripture abundant in the proof of it; and the experience of the Saints in a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner confirming it.

                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:47453:183"/>Afflictions and chaſtiſements,
<note place="margin">Afflictions they are profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> they become profitable, as the furnace to the gold, to purge out the droſs, to make a ſeparation between the pure mettal, and the ore.</p>
               <p>Profitable as phyſick to the body, to purge out the malignant humours.</p>
               <p>Profitable, as ſope to the cloth, to fetch out the ſtains, to take out the greaſie ſpots (it is the Scripture expreſſion, <hi>their hearts are as fat as greaſe</hi>) to make them white.</p>
               <p>Profitable, as the Thunder to the Ayr, to purge it, to make it more commodious to breath in.</p>
               <p>Profitable, as the wind to the water, to make it the purer by its ventilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Profitable, as the pruning knife to the tree, to make it more fruitful.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like metaphors we have, and by them we are to conceive of the good, and benefit that comes to us by Gods caſtigation, and fatherly exerciſing of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with his diſcipline, and rod of Affliction.</p>
               <p>But what are theſe bleſſed fruits, what is the profit accruing to the ſoul of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God by this means?</p>
               <p>I can but name part of them.
<note place="margin">The bleſſed fruit of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Beſides that which is expreſt in the Text, that we might be partaker of his holineſs, there are theſe gracious effects of afflictions. Wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the world: a bringing us into more acquaintance with God. <hi>Manaſſeth</hi> when he was in affliction,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 33.12</note> 
                  <hi>he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly before the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him; and then</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>he knew that the Lord he was God.</hi> God by this means makes us know our ſelves: the vanity of the creature; the ſinfulneſs of ſin; the ſweetneſs of the Word; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that is in the promiſes; makes us more compaſſionate to others; keepeth us from hell; and many other fruits there are of afflictions.</p>
               <p>But to paſs this.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing implyed in the Doctrine is this, that as afflictions are means condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to our profit, ſo God in exerciſing his people with them, mainly intendeth it. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>led thee through that great and terrible wilderneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 8.15.</note> 
                  <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were fiery Serpents, and Scorpions, and drought, where there was no water, ſuffered thee to hunger, brought thee into hard ſtraits;</hi> but what was Gods aim in this? <hi>that he might humble thee; and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at the latter end. By this</hi> (ſaith the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 27.9.</note> ſpeaking of the afflictions of the Church) <hi>ſhall the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I ſay is that which God intendeth by the afflictions of his people: and this is that which the ſervants of God, by faith have been able to apprehend, and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Lords meaning in all his ſharp diſpenſations towards them: As the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pbet <hi>Habakuk,</hi> having made a terrible deſcription of the Babyloniſh rod, he concludes in the twelfth verſe of his firſt Chapter;
<note place="margin">Hab. 1.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Art not thou from everlaſting, O Lord my God? We ſhall not die, O Lord, thou haſt ordained them for Judgment: and O mighty God, thon haſt eſtabliſhed them for correction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that likewiſe which the Saints of God have looked for,
<note place="margin">The Saints of God have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 2 Sam. 16.12.</note> and expected, that while the winds of afflictions have been blowing, ſome ſhip or other ſhould come home richly fraighted. So <hi>David,</hi> when that ſtorm of curſing came from the mouth of <hi>Shimei: Oh</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>let him alone, let him curſe, it may be that the Lord will look on mine affliction,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.12.</note> 
                  <hi>and that the Lord will requite good for his curſing this day.</hi> So when <hi>Rabſhaketh</hi> came up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Let him alone (ſaith <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah) anſwer him not a word,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 37.4.</note> 
                  <hi>it may be the Lord will hear the words of Rabſhaketh, whom his Maſter hath ſent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the Lord hath heard;</hi> It may be the Lord will open his ear upon this rage and blaſphemy, and conſider his people and do them good. The Saints of God, I ſay, have expected good, and benefit from Gods afflicting of them.</p>
               <p>For the uſe of this,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For reproof.</note> and ſo to draw to a concluſion. In the firſt place: Seeing this is Gods intent in all his adminiſtrations to his people, eſpecially in his caſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, and reaching out unto them ſuch ſharp and bitter potions. It may ſerve to check and controul all thoſe hard thoughts, that we are apt to ſuffer to lodge <pb n="351" facs="tcp:47453:183"/>within us,
<note place="margin">Gods children prone to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſter the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of God in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> concerning Gods dealing with us, in the time of our diſtreſſes. Apt we are to ſpeak fooliſhly and unadviſedly concerning God, and to miſconſter his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations. This hath been the frailty of Gods deareſt ſervants in their affliction. <hi>I ſhall one day</hi> (ſaid <hi>David</hi>) <hi>periſh by the hand of Saul. Woe is me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) <hi>for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips. The Lord</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>hath broken my teeth with gravel ſtones,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 27.1. Eſa. 6.5. Lam. 3.16.18. Iſa. 49.14.</note> and covered me with aſhes, he hath removed my ſoul far off from peace, and I ſaid my ſtrength and my hope is periſhed from the Lord. The Lord hath forſaken me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Zion</hi>) <hi>and my Lord hath forgotten me. Job</hi> though for a good while he carried himſelf very fairly, and demeaned himſelf very warily toward God; yet when he began to be wet to his skin, then he ſpeaks fooliſhly, and unadviſedly, falleth to <hi>the curſing of his day;</hi> not to the curſing of his God, as Satan thought he would, but of his day, though that was too much, and ill beſeeming ſo holy a man, The Saints, I ſay, are apt to miſtake themſelves this way, and to over-ſhoot themſelves in this caſe. We ſhould therefore humble our ſelves before the Lord for this diſtemper of ſoul, and labour to keep down ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thoughts, and hard diſputings that are apt to riſe within us againſt God, and his diſpenſations: And conſider, that whatſoever our thoughts are, <hi>yet the Lord knoweth his own thoughts concerning us;</hi> as he himſelf ſpeaks in <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. howſoever (ſaith he) you may think that I intend to cut you off for ever, <hi>yet I know my thoughts that I think towards you, even thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again ſecondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For comfort.</note> it may ſerve to comfort the godly concerning all the means and inſtruments of their ſufferings, whether they be men or devils. Wicked men and devils whom God uſeth as a Rod to chaſtiſe his people, their malice is great, and their rage violent, and they march on with much fury againſt the godly; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their utter ruin and devaſtation, and purpoſe nothing leſs. <hi>But O Aſſyrian</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>the rod of mine anger,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 10.57.</note> 
                  <hi>and the ſtaffe in their hand is mine indignation: howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo, but it is in his heart to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and cut off;</hi> But (ſaith the Lord) whatſoever his meaning is, I know what my intentions are; he is but the rod in mine hand, and I will give ſuch ſtroaks with it,
<note place="margin">Simile</note>. as my people may bear, and ſuch as may be for their profit. This, I ſay, ſhould comfort us concerning all the inſtruments of our ſuffering, whatſoever they be. The Phyſitian, you know, applieth the horſe-leaches to his diſtemppred Patient, the Horſe-leech intendeth nothing but the ſatiating and filling himſelf with the bloud of the ſick party; but the Phyſitan hath another aim, even the drawning out of the putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and corrupted blood. God ſuffereth wicked men &amp; devils as Horſe-leeches to ſuck his people, to draw their blood, but it is in order to their good; it is no matter what wicked men think, though <hi>Aſhur</hi> think not ſo, yet God purpoſeth it, and aims at it,
<note place="margin">Iſay. 12.12.</note> and in concluſion effects it; and <hi>then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it ſhall come to paſs that when the Lord hath performed his whole worke upon mount Sion, I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the King of Aſſyria, and the glory of his high looks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again in the third place.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Exhortation to a patient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the fruit of affliction.</note> Seeing this is Gods aim in all his afflictions, whatſoever the inſtrument be, how ſharp ſoever the caſtigation be, or of what nature, whether it be in a ſpiritual way by ſore temptations and buffetings of Satan, or outwardly by loſſes in our eſtate, or death of friends, &amp;c. ſeeing I ſay this is Gods purpoſe and intent that his people may be profited; Let us quietly and patiently apply our ſelves unto God, and expect the <hi>quiet and peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs, that ſhall ſpring up in due time, to thoſe that are this way exerciſed by the Lord:</hi> Look for it and preſs on to this, quietly to wait on the Lord our God for a bleſſed fruit of ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations.</p>
               <p>An argument <hi>ab utili,</hi> is an argument of great prevail: what will not men do for Profit? It is for profit that men riſe up early and go to bed late, and eat the bread of carefulneſs. The Husband-man takes much pains and plows his ground, endures many ſharp ſtorms, and piercing winters; the Merchant runs divers hazards abroad, and all for profit: ſo ſhould we be willing patiently and quietly to ſubmit, to Gods dealing, humbly to apply our ſelves to his wiſe and fatherly adminiſtrations, ſeeing he intendeth by it our profit. And take heed of murmuring and repining <pb n="352" facs="tcp:47453:184"/>againſt the Lord: this will make him indeed to lay heavier blows upon us; an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Patient makes the Phyſitian deal more harſhly, and a ſtrugling child procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for himſelf the more and ſorer ſtripes; what though our potion be bitter, ſo long as it is wholeſome, have we not reaſon to ſubmit our ſelves?</p>
               <p>But here is the main thing we ſtick at.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </note> You may happily reply; Indeed if we could ſee our corruptions ſubdued, our hearts humbled, the pride that is within us abated, and that God would be pleaſed to bring us more nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er to him, and make us more heavenly minded, and wean our affections from the world; If we could ſee the fruit of all our ſufferings and temptations and croſſes, it would be an abundant ſatisfaction to our ſouls; but alas, alas, we cannot ſee this profit; our hearts are ſtill full of many ſpiritual diſtempers, and great prevailings of evil there is upon us; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe Storms and Froſts, and tempeſtuous hard Winters, yet theſe weeds of wickedneſs grow and are marvellous lively: this is the bitterneſs of the cup, and this is that which ſinketh the heart moſt under all thoſe preſſures which lie upon us.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> firſt, we muſt judge rightly and wiſely; and conſider well whether it be the time for the fruit of affliction to ſpring forth. <hi>No affliction for the preſent ſeemeth joyous;</hi> and no affliction, it may be for the time of its working appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth commodious: But (ſaith the Apoſtle) they do bring forth <hi>the quiet fruit of righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again ſecondly, we may perhaps bear too much upon the phyſick: alas! afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and croſſes of themſelves they will rather drive us further then draw us nearer unto God; we are therefore to ſubmit our ſelves unto. God in his way of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, and to intreat his bleſſing upon them, that through that they may be made ſucceſsful. As <hi>every creature,</hi> ſo every condition both of proſperity and adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>is ſanctifled to us by the Word and by prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And take heed of diſputing againſt the Lord, as we are apt to do, he is wiſe above all that we can conceive, he is wonderful in working, and knoweth now to bring about the good of his people in a wonderful way: what if he will plunge thee into the mire in order to holineſs? what if Chriſt will put clay upon a mans eyes in order to ſight, a medicine more likely to put out his eyes. Conſidering therefore that God is wiſe and wonderful in his working; let us apply our ſelves to him, and in due time we ſhall ſee the fruit and benefit of all his adminiſtrations.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now have come to the third and laſt propoſition, and that was, That this profit that God aimeth at in all his caſtigations of his children, is to make them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his holineſs. And this is profit indeed, when God thereby draweth us from the world, and makes us more heavenly minded, and more dead to the creature, purgeth away our droſs, and takes away that filth and corruption that is in us; oh this will acquit all the coſt, and make amends for all the labour and pains and hardſhip we have been made to endure. But I ſhall forbear to inſiſt upon this.</p>
               <p>So much for the Text.</p>
               <p>There is a word to be ſpoken according to cuſtome with reſpect to the occaſion of our meeting. I have done the main part of my task, which was to preſent to you a word of inſtruction; and therefore for the occaſion concerning this young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man diſceaſed, whoſe Funerals we now ſolemnize, I ſhall but ſpeak a few words and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>I need not to ſpeak any thing concerning his parentage and diſcent; nor much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his education, I am couſident that that was religious and gracious, and ſuch as wherein there was a ſecond travel in order to his ſpiritual birth, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt might be formed in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For his own particular, though I can ſpeak nothing upon my own knowledge (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a meer ſtranger) yet I have ſuch a teſtimony concerning him, from thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve credence both of me and you, as that I ſhall conclude that of him, as may give us good hope concerning his final and eternal eſtate.</p>
               <p>If ſo be contrition of heart and ſorrow for ſin? If earneſt and conſtant prayer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; If lamenting of youthful miſcarriages and the not anſwering of time and <pb n="353" facs="tcp:47453:184"/>means, and opportunities, and religious education, and that godly care that was exerciſed in order to his ſpiritnal welfare and building of him up in the knowledge of God and of Chriſt. If, I ſay, the lamenting of the neglect of opportunities of this kind: If ſo be the deſire of the prayers of others for him, and that out of a ſenſe of his own diſability to plead his own cauſe: If ſo be a gracious communication of God unto him in wayes of comfort in the time of his ſickneſs, ſupporting him under divers preſſures, and many ſore and grievous temptations that lay upon him: If ſo be his ſetled reſolution concerning his ſpiritual eſtate; and the ſatisfying of others in many doubts and diſquiets of ſpirit that roſe within him. If ſo be the due reſpect to the Lords day, the deſire of promoting the ſanctifying of it both by himſelf and others, with a continual grief proceeding from a ſenſe of his own diſability to anſwer to the occaſion and duties of the day. If there be any thing to be concluded of concerning Religion, from ſuch paſſages as theſe; then (brethren) I have all theſe as ſo many materials put into my hand to build withall, and ſo to reare up a teſtimony before you concerning this diſceaſed.</p>
               <p>And thus in brief have I teſtified of him; and to you all he (though dead) now ſpeaks, but in a more ſpecial manner to you that are young men: his death, and that example we have in him of mortality, is as a loud Sermon preached unto you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the care you ought to have, to bethink your ſelves in your younger years of the things that concern your ſpiritual and eternal welfare, and how much it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you now to <hi>give all dilligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> Your thoughts (it may be) are too much upon your patrimony and inheritances, your houſes and poſſeſſions, your great eſtates and your matches, that thereby you may (as you uſe to ſay) raiſe your fortunes: too too apt you are to be taken up with theſe conſiderations and to purſue thoughts of this nature: but you ſee by this example how God may come and prevent the accompliſhment of all theſe, <hi>and in that day,</hi> in that very day <hi>all theſe thoughts will periſh,</hi> death may come &amp; marry you to the duſt, and call you, not to your fathers manſions, but to the common houſe appointed for all living,
<note place="margin">Iob 17.4.</note> where you muſt <hi>ſay to corruption, thou art my father, and to the worme, thou art my mother and my ſiſter:</hi> this was his condition, and ſo may yours be too: Therefore you young men, <hi>remember you your Creatour in the dayes of your youth;</hi> and know you that God hath provided inſtructions and counſels in his Word that are directed to young men, that they may know <hi>how to cleanſe their way,</hi> and <hi>to flie the luſts of youth,</hi> and betimes to begin with God, that ſo whether they live to old age, or be cut off in youth, they may <hi>be gathered to their Fathers in a good and a full age, like a Shock of Corn,</hi> and ſo receive the bleſſing of the promiſe.</p>

               <p>Firſt, the duty that is to be performed, it is this, to ſtabliſh &amp; comfort their hearts, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The word that is here tranſlated,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>trouble,</hi> it ſignifieth ſuch a trouble as is in water when the mud is ſtirred up, or when the waves and ſurges are raiſed by ſome tempeſt or ſtorm; It ſignifieth ſuch a trouble as is in an Army, when the Souldiers are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranked, and routed, when they are diſordered, and it ſhewes thus much, that thoſe diſtempers that are in the hearts of men, in the affections of men, do exceedingly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their judgments, that they can ſee no more, nor diſcern things no better, then a man can do in a muddy water. All the affections are as ſo many Souldiers in an Army diſordered, that keep not their due ſubordination to their leader and guide, by reaſon that the underſtanding that ſhould guide the will and affections, is now made a ſervant to them.</p>
               <p>And this diſtemper of ſpirit ariſeth from the inordinacy of the affections, the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate motion, and agitation of them.</p>
               <p>This is called <hi>trouble, Let not your hearts be troubled;</hi> Be not diſturbed thus, and diſquieted, and diſordered; So that no faculty of the ſoul can perform its own work; So as that it is diſabled to judge of things according to truth, but that you are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and deluded by miſts and appearances.</p>
               <p>It is with the mind in ſorrow,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simile.</hi>
                  </note> as it is with the eye in tears, that cannot ſee a thing clearly, ſo the mind cannot judge of things diſtinctly, when the ſoul is diſturbed; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that which our Saviour aims at here, hath a particular reſpect to the affections of fear, and grief, when theſe are in the exceſs, the mind is troubled, when a man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-fears any thing, or over-grieves any thing, he is troubled and diſquieted; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled;</hi> that is, grieve not for things more then they are to be grieved for, and fear not things more then they are to be feared. For all theſe will diſ-joynt the ſoul (as it were) it will put the ſpirit to much pain and diſquiet, as a bone out of joynt; Therefore by all means keep your hearts in a right ſtate, in that order that God hath ſet them; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That, that I will briefly note here, ſhall be but thus much; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>Men are wondrous prone,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</note> even the very beſt men, to be diſturbed in their paſſions and affeictions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour Chriſt ſpeaks it here to his Diſciples, to thoſe that he had taught, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom he had gone, as an excellent example all his dayes, yet theſe holy men, theſe followers of Chriſt, that had followed him through ſo many dangers, and after ſo many teachings, and inſtructings of them; he had need to call upon them, to ſtir them up to conſider of their own eſtate, that <hi>their hearts might not be troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You may ſee the Malady in the Medicine. Every prohibition in the word ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a corruption, and an aptneſs in the natural heart and ſpirit of man, to ſin, and tranſgreſs in that particular; Therefore when Chriſt ſpeaks to his Diſciples, and tells them they ſhould not be troubled. It ſhews that even the beſt men, are ſubject to exceſs of paſſion, and affection, to be diſturbed, and troubled, through immoderate fear, or grief, for that was the caſe of the Diſciples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:47453:186"/>Now briefly I will ſhew the grounds of it, and come to the Application, becauſe I will haſten.<lb/>
This trouble that is upon the ſpirits ſometimes of the beſt men, it ariſeth,<lb/>
Partly from Gods providence, and hand upon them.<lb/>
And partly from Satan.<lb/>
And partly from themſelves.<lb/>
I will ſhew you the cauſes in theſe particalars,
<note place="margin">Ground:</note> and then apply it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 From God. Pſal. 84.</note> it ariſeth many times from the hand of God. The Lord is ſaid <hi>to be a Sun, and a ſhield;</hi> The Lord will be known to be a Sun, and a ſhield to his people.</p>
               <p>Now, look as it is with the earth when the Sun withdraweth his light, it is all dark and cold, and dead; So it is with the hearts of the beſt men, when God withdraws the light of his countenance from the ſoul, it is as the earth at midnight. And as it is with Souldiers in the battel, if their ſhields be taken from them, they are expoſed to every dart, and danger; every thing may annoy them, and wound them. So it is in the ſtate of the ſoul; if God withdraw himſelf from it, and do not now ſupport it as before, and do not fence, and ſtrengthen it as at other times, the fiery darts of Satan will pierce deep into the ſoul, and the ſpirit will not be able to uphold it ſelf againſt theſe aſſaults.</p>
               <p>Now God withdraws himſelf ſometimes from his ſervants,
<note place="margin">Why God withdraws the light of his coun<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

In reſpect either of the time 
<list>
                     <item>paſt,</item>
                     <item>preſent,</item>
                     <item>to come.</item>
                  </list>
Sometimes God doth it in reſpect of the time paſt,
<note place="margin">1 For correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abuſe of his mercies.</note> and ſo he doth it by way of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Firſt, to correct his children for their former wantonneſs, they have abuſed the expreſſions of love, and now as a Father takes away the light from his child, when he ſees he makes no better uſe of it then to play with it. So God ſometime takes away the light of his countenance; that is, he caſts clouds before himſelf, he doth not manifeſt himſelf in that loving favour, when his ſervants neglect that reverence and fear that he expects from them in the midſt of his mercies.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 Of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> this he doth ſometimes as a correction of their negligence, when God hath called on them, from time to time, and they have neglected calling on God; he hath called upon them for duty, and for the leaving of ſuch particular evils, and they have neglected it. Now God withdraws himſelf, to make them know what it is to do ſo; And becauſe they will not know what it is to hear his voyce, when he calls, he will make them feel it, by his not hearing their voyce when they pray.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he calls to them,
<note place="margin">Cant. 5.</note> as he did to the Church in the Canticles; <hi>Open to me my ſiſter, my Spouſe, my love,</hi> &amp;c. The Church is negligent and careleſs; <hi>I have put off my cloaths, how ſhall I put them on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> Now he withdraws himſelf from the ſoul, and what is the the end of it? <hi>The keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſtrike her, and the watch-men take away her vail;</hi> and now ſhe is left to trouble and perplexity, becauſe Chriſt had abſented himſelf, whom ſhe would not entertain, when he offered himſelf; Thus God doth to correct that, that is paſt.</p>
               <p>And farther,
<note place="margin">3 Of their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſecurity.</note> God doth it ſometimes to correct that carnal conſidence, and ſecurity whereunto men are wondrous prone, when they go on in a clear way with much comfort, with wind and tide. <hi>I ſaid in my proſperity</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>I ſhall never be moved, thou Lord haſt made my mountain ſo ſtrong;</hi> but what followeth upon it? ſaith he, <hi>Lord thou hideſt thy face, and I was troubled,</hi> now trouble came upon him, trouble of Spirit, becauſe he reſted too much in that outward mountain, in that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition whereunto God had exalted him, and he placed his hope too much on this, and thought it ſhould be alwaies thus, now God turns his hand and then <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is troubled: and that is the firſt particular in the firſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, God hath a further aim, and that is for the time preſent, and that is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, to inform all his ſervants where there ſtrength lies, where all their good lies, <pb n="358" facs="tcp:47453:187"/>it lies not in themſelves,
<note place="margin">3 To teach them wherein their preſent comſort and happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifts.</note> it lies not in any creature: And therefore God will have them ſeek it in him, and that they may do it, he draws them to it by ſence, they ſhall be deprived of comfort in reſpect ſometime of outward conveniences, and in reſpect ſometime of the light of his countenance ſhining upon their ſouls,</p>
               <p>How do we know that the Moon ſhines on the earth by a borrowed light? but becauſe we ſee it is not alwayes alike in its light,
<note place="margin">Simile</note> we ſee ſometimes it hath a full light, and ſometimes it is enlightned but by the half, and ſometimes by ſome little part, where we ſee this diſproportion that it is not alwaies alike, we know by this that the light of the Moon is borrowed from ſomewhat elſe, from the Sun.</p>
               <p>Now how do we know that the heart of man is fed and relieved, and ſupported with comfort from without it ſelf, with borrowed and received comfort? but by this; Becauſe the ſtate of Gods ſervants in reſpect of the ſpiritual quiet, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and contentment of heart is not alwaies alike, but ſometime they have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of joy, that they ſeem to be (as it were) in heaven. Sometimes they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with many diſquiets and griefs, that they ſeem to be <hi>caſt down to the deep,</hi> as it is ſaid of the Marriners in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. what is the reaſon of this? but <hi>that no fleſh ſhould glory in it ſelf;</hi> that every man might know that whatſoever he hath to make his life comfortable, and pleaſing to him it is from God that diſpenſeth it to men in that proportion as ſeemeth good to his own wiſdome.</p>
               <p>God will have us know that all the happineſs of our ſpirits is in their union with the chief of ſpirits, with himſelf; and that when they are but a little ſeparated from him, when he doth but a little withdraw himſelf from them, they are as a thing that is dead; how ſhall we know that the branches have ſap from the root, that it is that that makes them flouriſh and grow? but by this: If you do but cut them off from the root they whither preſently. So it is with the ſpirit, with the heart of man; if God do but a little withdraw himſelf, let ſin but make a ſeparation between God and man, now a man is like a withered branch, he hath nothing now to revive him, becauſe he is divided from the root: At the leaſt it is with him as it is with a tree in Winter, though the ſap remains in the root; ſo though he remain in union with the root, yet the moiſture is gotten into the root it ſelf, and doth not now infuſe it ſelf into the branches; I confeſs the ſervant of God that is once united to Chriſt ſhall never be ſeparated, the union it is now, and alwaies ſhall be, but nevertheleſs, the ſap and comfort of the Spirit, it may remain in the head, <hi>our life</hi> may be <hi>hid in Chriſt,</hi> and may not appear in us at all: And we are then in that eſtate as if we were branches cut off, whereby it may appear, that whatſoever life and comfort, and ſtrength of heart we had, it was from Chriſt, and by the influence and work of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>And then for the time to come,
<note place="margin">3 For preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> God doth it to prevent ſome diſtempers that might grow on the hearts of his ſervants if they ſhould alwaies be in a like ſtate of ſpiritual joy. God doth it to prevent pride, <hi>Paul</hi> was apt to be <hi>lift up with thoſe revelations,</hi> therefore <hi>a meſſenger of Satan was ſent to buffet him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Of pride.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo it may be to prevent carnal confidence in the creature,
<note place="margin">2 Of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the creature or in habits of grace.</note> a man would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to aſcribe ſomewhat to himſelf, to his preſent condition, if it were alwaies thus with him, you know what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>We received in our ſelves the ſentence of death that we might not truſt in our ſelves, but in God that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the dead;</hi> look to what end <hi>Paul</hi> received the ſentence of death, to that end Gods faithful ſervants ſometimes receive the very ſence of death (as it were) and the ſence of the deſtitution, and want of all ſpiritual comforts for the preſent; Why? That they <hi>might not truſt in themſelves,</hi> or in thoſe habits of grace and comforts they have, or in any creature whatſoever. The work of Gods ſpirit in the regenerate ſoul, it is but a creature, a work of God, and God will not have men truſt in any ſuch thing, in what then? <hi>In him that raiſeth from the dead;</hi> God will bring them to ſuch a ſtate, that they ſhall ſeem as dead men, as deſtitute of all ſpiritual comforts they have, that they might truſt in him that is able to raiſe them out of ſuch a ſtate as that, that look as he is able to give life to the dead body, ſo he is able to give comfort to the diſtreſſed ſoul,
<note place="margin">Ground.</note> that is at that time, <hi>in the ſhaddow of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 From Satan.</note> it comes ſometimes from Satan; and that is thus, Satan wonderfully ſets <pb n="359" facs="tcp:47453:187"/>himſelf againſt <hi>the ſeed of the woman,</hi> eſpecially againſt the promiſed ſeed, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he will alway be at his heel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. and in his oppoſition againſt Chriſt, he ſets againſt the very glory of Chriſt among men, and that is his kingdom, he would not have Chriſt exalt his kingdom over men.</p>
               <p>Now the kingdom of Chriſt conſiſts as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>not in meat and drink, but in righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> If he cannot keep a Chriſtian, a true beleever, from unrighteouſneſs, he will labour to interrupt his peace: if he cannot keep him from the habit of peace, peace in the grounds of it, yet he will keep him from the exerciſe and effects of that peace, from joy, he will hinder that as much as he can, that he may not have the ſence of his bleſſedneſs: he knows that ſpiritual joy ſtrengthens a man to all ſpiritual duties; and his endeavour is to weaken all the ſervants of Chriſt, in all their ſervices; and therefore he doth, at leaſt labour againſt that with all his might, that if they will needs go on, yet nevertheleſs to propound, and occaſion as many things that may be troubleſome to them, and diſquiet their hearts, as he can.</p>
               <p>And there are two principal wayes (that I may but touch them) whereby Satan
<note place="margin">How Satan cauſeth trouble in the hearts of Gods ſervants.</note> wondrouſly prevails in this particular.</p>
               <p>The one is by ſtealing out of their hearts thoſe precious promiſes, thoſe comforts, whereby the Word of God revives the ſoul.
<note place="margin">1 By ſtealing out of theſt hearts the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Goſpel.</note> 
                  <hi>You have forgotten</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the conſolations of God.</hi> And the devil meets in man with two advantages, to help him in the effecting of this; Firſt he turns the thoughts upon new objects, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he doth diametrically, and directly ſet himſelf againſt God in the way of his ſpecial providence:
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> that very thing that God in wonderfull wiſdom hath wrought in the heart for the eaſe and comfort of man, Satan makes it an occaſion of trouble, and that is this, the variety of mans thoughts; what is the reaſon that God hath framed the mind of man to change his thoughts continually, and to have innumerable thoughts? Certainly for the very eaſe of the Spirit of man, for the very eaſe of the ſoul of man: For if the mind ſhould keep intent upon any one thought long, it would ſo work upon that, that it would weary it ſelf out in working, as we ſee men by exceſs of grief in particular caſes, grow to be phrenſie, and deſtracted, and the like: Now this aptneſs of the mind to run to variety of thoughts that God hath made for the eaſe of man, Satan turns it as a help to hurt him. A man ſhall run on into a world of buſineſs, of temptations, and diſtractions that ſhall draw him from the thought of thoſe things that he hath heard for the relieving of his Spirit wherein God ſpake comfort to his heart, that he may the better faſten thoſe diſcouragements on him, that he deſires.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another advantage he hath for this end is this, that is, he wondrouſly prevails upon the heart of man by a careleſs neglect that is in men: every man loves eaſe; There is ſuch a ſpirit in man, ſuch a diſpoſition in the ſpirit of man, that he avoids the things ordinarily that have great labour: this diſpoſition to eaſe, and reſt, Satan ſerves himſelf on, and makes great uſe of; ſo when a man hath come from hearing the Word, and reading the Scriptures, whereas he ſhould now be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, and labour in meditation to work thoſe things on his heart, that now the root might faſten, and things might ſettle on the ſoul, he paſſeth by theſe eaſily; now the heart of a man lies open as the high way,
<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> you know the parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. when <hi>the ſeed fell on the high-way, the Fowls of the ayr came,</hi> and picked it up, and it was gone preſently, where there is no pains taken with the heart of a man, as there is none taken with the high way, that the ſeed that falls there might grow, as in the plowed ground, when there is no pains taken with the heart, now every notion, every direction, and every ſpiritual inſtruction it lies lightly there, and is ſoon carried out, this is the advantage that Satan makes of a mans love of eaſe.</p>
               <p>But there is another thing concerning the way that Satan takes,
<note place="margin">2 By preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the ſoul the truths of God in falſe gloſſes.</note> not only to ſteal it out of the mind by thoſe two wayes, but again by preſenting the very truths of God to men in falſe gloſſes, ſo as a man cannot diſcern them in their own ſhape, and nature, but in ſuch colours as he preſents them to them. If the time would have ſerved, I might inſtance in ſeveral particulars; I will but touch upon one or two, and leave the inlargement to your own meditations. Sometimes, things that are <pb n="360" facs="tcp:47453:188"/>great, and of precious uſe, ſhall be preſented ſmall, and of no account: and things again that are ſmall and little, ſhall be preſented wondrous great: The mercies of God, the Attributes of God, the promiſes of the Goſpel, the ſufficiency of the merits of Chriſt, theſe ſhall ſeem ſmall things, little to be regarded, leſs then ever God intended them to be: And on the contrary, a mans own ſins, his own diſtempers ſhall be made exceeding great: Worldly things ſhall be preſented, as things of the greateſt conſequence; and ſpiritual things as meer acceſſories, as things that depend upon them, and that come in after. Sometimes again, things that are moſt neceſſary to be underſtood and known, things that ſhould be particularly applyed, ſhall be preſented obſcurely and confuſedly; and ſometimes things of leſſer conſequence, the knowledge whereof is not ſo neceſſary, ſhall be preſented with more clearneſs, and with ſtrong perſwaſions to the ſtudy and knowledge of them. But I will not ſtand on this: this is enough to give you a taſte of Satans ſubtilty this way, whereby he wondrouſly prevails in bringing trouble upon the ſpirits of men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Ground, 3. From our ſelves.</note> it is from our ſelves, and ſo it comes to paſs from that general corruption that is in our natures, from whence all other ſins flow, that the ſpirits of men are troubled, and diſturbed, by things that fall out from day to day.</p>
               <p>And firſt it comes to paſs,
<note place="margin">From ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of the body.</note> that the ſoul of man is miſerably in bondage, and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and inthraled, and is deprived of liberty (as it were) through the diſtemper of the body; as in Melancholy and ſickneſs, we ſee how the ſoul is diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>urbed by the very diſeaſes, and diſtempers in the body it ſelf, and that by vertue of that ſimpathy in the ſoul with the body, it riſeth from the union of it, to the body by the ſpirits: but this I will paſs by.</p>
               <p>Sometimes we ſee the ſoul ſubdued with luſts and corruptions,
<note place="margin">2. Prevailing of ſome ſtrong luſt.</note> ſomeſtrong luſt, ſome ſtrong ſin or other prevails; And then as it is with the Fowl that is now fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the air, it may be there is bird-lime caſt upon the wings of it, it falls down preſently,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.</note> and can flie no further; ſo it is with the ſoul, ſomewhat preſſeth it down, ſomewhat compaſſeth it about, and coups it in, as that expreſſion is uſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Let us caſt off the ſin that compaſſeth us about, and that preſſeth ſo heavy down, that we may run with patience the race that is ſet before us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſometimes the ſoul is diſturbed by inordinate paſſions,
<note place="margin">3 Inordinate paſſions.</note> which ariſe from that general diſtemper that is diffuſed through every faculty, and ſo the underſtanding looks upon things as through a miſt, it ſees nothing clearly, and in moſt common things it is blind, and it is led by blind affections too, and <hi>when the blind leads the blind, both fall into the ditch,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: and ſo the memory that ſhould retain the precious treaſures,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> the promiſes of the Goſpel to relieve the ſoul in all caſes, it is like a leaking veſſel that lets things run out, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>Take heed that the things you have heard, run not out,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, alluding to that Metaphor.</p>
               <p>And the very conſcience it ſelf that ſhould be concluſive, it now reſts in generals and uncertainties, conſcience ſhould determin what my caſe is, whether I be the child of God, or no; whether I be in the ſtate of grace or no, to put a man to bring things to particular: now for the moſt part by mans own neglect it remains in doubt, it may be I am, it may be I am not, it may be I have a right in the Covenant of grace, it may be not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now becauſe conſcience is not come to that reſolute concluſive act that a man may determine of his own particular caſe, hence it is that every thing troubles, and diſquiets him. Thus beloved you ſee the reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>We will briefly paſs it over with a word of Application.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. To teach us compaſſion toward thoſe that are in trouble.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And firſt it ſhould teach us compaſſion towards thoſe whoſe ſpirits are troubled; our Saviour Chriſt ſaith here, <hi>Let not you hearts be troubled;</hi> He conſidered of them in their weakneſs, and doth not much upbraid them with it, but helps to bring them out of it in much mercy, and love, and ſo ſhould we. There is ſuch a diſpoſition riſing from the pride, cruelty, and uncharitableneſs of the hearts of men, that they are apt to add to the burthen of the afflicted, and to make their afflictions more by their cenſuring of their troubles. You know the ſpeech of old <hi>Eli</hi> a good man, but yet he failed in that, when he ſaw <hi>Hannah</hi> in great trouble of ſpirit, uttering her heart before the Lord; <hi>Lay away thy drunkenneſs,</hi> (ſaith he) he thought ſhe was <pb n="361" facs="tcp:47453:188"/>drunk, at leſt with ſome paſſion, and all came but from perplexity, and diſturbance of ſpirit, and in that manner he rather added to her grief then eaſed hen; So <hi>Jobs</hi> friends you ſee what they ſaid, they preſently judged him in that caſe, as one that God had caſt off for hypocriſie, and for his pride, and covetouſneſs, or for ſome one thing or other, and therefore it was thus with him; Nay, Chriſt himſelf, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all men was thus much concerning Chriſt himſelf;
<note place="margin">Iſa 53.4.</note> 
                  <hi>We did eſleem him ſtrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ſmitten of God, and afflicted.</hi> The intent of the phraſe is, as one ſmitten for his own ill, as if God had now manifeſted that he did not acknowledge him to be ſo holy and righteous. So thus you ſee the inclination in the heart of man, to uncharitable jndging of thoſe that God hath caſt down, and ſuffers to be exerciſed under many afflictions, and troubles; Let us learn then ſpiritual wiſdome; let us learn love, and ſpiritual mercy, to judge more favourably of the ſtate of thoſe whom we ſee troubled in ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Many times God infeebleth, and diſtreſſeth the ſpirits of his beſt ſervants, to abate the pride of men, that none might exalt himſelf before God; Nay, in the very thing wherein they have excelled, in the ſame thing he ſometimes abaſeth them: you ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> he is called the <hi>Father of the faithful;</hi> his excellency was his faith, yet faithful <hi>Abraham</hi> is detected in Scripture of much unbelief in ſome particulars; Who would think that he ſhould expoſe <hi>Sara,</hi> as he did to ſave himſelf? that he ſhould do it, that was called the Father of the faithful? you have heard (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James, of the patience of Job,</hi> the very excellency of <hi>Job</hi> was his patience: who would think that ever patient <hi>Job</hi> ſhould utter ſuch things as he did, ſometime, even curſing the very day of his birth? <hi>David</hi> a man of a chearful ſpirit, a man full of the praiſes of God, a man wonderous large, when he comes to ſpeak of the glory of God at ſeveral times. A man would have thought him of an invincible fortitude, and courage, yet nevertheleſs you ſhall have <hi>David</hi> ſo caſt down, as that he thinks the Lord had forgotten him, and that the Lord would ſhew no mercy upon him, that the Lord had hid himſelf from him, and that he would never regard him more; who would think that ever <hi>David,</hi> that abounded ſo in the comforts of the ſpirit ſometimes, ſhould be ſo dejected at ſuch times as thoſe were, when he was in ſuch a conflict?</p>
               <p>Why doth God do this?
<note place="margin">God ſuffers his ſervants to be in inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and why.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To ſhew thus much, that the very beſt of his ſervants in the chief of their excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are dependant on him ſtill, they have nothing of themſelves, or from themſelves. Therefore they ſhall ſometimes ſeem to want that they have, that the very having, and uſing of it, may be aſcribed to his glory. Then let us now reaſon thus, when we ſee the ſervants of God in trouble, exerciſed under diſquiet; Let us conclude, now God is glorifying himſelf. This the Apoſtle infers, <hi>He will rejoyce in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, becauſe the power of Chriſt is manifeſted by it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our ſelves, it ſhould teach us (according to the intent of this place) above all things to labour, that our hearts may be kept in that bleſſed plight of ſpiritual joy, that we may be ſtrengthened with freeneſs of heart to ſerve God in our inward man; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ſhould this be done?</p>
               <p>The Text tells us here (and ſo I come briefly to the ſecond thing obſervable in the Text, the means) <hi>you beleeve in God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beleeve alſo in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the words are read in the tranſlation, they ſeem to be uttered by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, as much as if Chriſt had ſaid, ſince yon already beleeve in God, now beleeve in me. The <hi>Syriack</hi> ſeems to expreſs it otherwiſe, and ſo render it by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and to make here an intimation of two duties, as a help of quieting the heart, and ſo it reads it; <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me,</hi> propounding a twofold object, where-about faith ſhould be exerciſed, that the heart may be quieted in the time of any trouble.</p>
               <p>The firſt is God, conſidered in the Trinity of perſons, in the unity of Eſſence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is Chriſt, Mediator, God, and Man.</p>
               <p>Now, ſaith he, beleeve in God, that is the firſt, reſt upon God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:47453:189"/>Then the ſecond is, <hi>beleeve in me alſo;</hi> as one that is the Mediator between God and you, now making your peace with God; So the ſecond part ſeems to be the prevention of an objection; For when he ſaith, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in God,</hi> they might ſay, Alas, ſhall we beleeve in God, that are ſinful men; <hi>The ſinners in Sion cry out, Who ſhall dwell with conſuming fire?</hi> &amp;c. Therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>beleeve alſo in me;</hi> that is, know that God will be your God, in, and for my ſake he is reconciled, and well pleaſed with you. Therefore in all your approaches to God take me with you, look up to God, pray to him, depend upon God through me, ſtill keep me as a Mediatour between God and you, and this will preſerve your hearts in peace. The time would not ſerve, if I ſhould go over things particularly and in a full way; Therefore I will touch the heads of things, and it ſhall be thus much; that,<lb/>

<note place="margin">2 Cron. 20.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Truſt in God, I will wait on him, he is my God. Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> in that excellent ſpeech to his Souldiers, that were now troubled, for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their enemies againſt them; <hi>Beleeve in God, and you ſhall proſper, beleeve his Prophets, and you ſhall be eſtabliſhed;</hi> that is the way to ſtabliſh the heart, to beleeve in God, revealing himſelf in his Word. It is noted of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. He therefore <hi>endured</hi> all that he did, becauſe <hi>he looked on him that is inviſible.</hi> And thoſe three companions of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 3. <hi>Our God</hi> (ſay they) <hi>whom we ſerve is able to help us, but if he will not, we will not worſhip thy golden Image.</hi> There was matter of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſquiet in the heart to be put to ſuch a plung, that they muſt either worſhip, or be caſt into the Furnace, heated ſeven times hotter; Well, this eaſed them of all trouble,
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1, 12.</note> and diſquiet; <hi>they knew whom they have truſted, and he was able to keep that, that was committed to him, to the coming of Chriſt.</hi> As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it, with which he alſo reſted abundantly ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the want of this, hath been the cauſe of that perplexity, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet that hath been upon the hearts of Gods ſervants at all times. That was the reaſon that <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſo diſturbed, and diſquieted, in that fear of what ſhould be done to him in Egypt, certainly he failed in this, in reſting upon God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> was wondrouſly troubled, when the Lord bad him go to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Lord ſend by him whom thou ſhouldeſt ſend, I am a man of a ſtammering tongue,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will be with thy tongue;</hi> He bids him quiet his heart in that perplexity, and reſt on him that made the tongue, to be with his tongue; And becauſe there was another ſecret that troubled him, the Lord knew his heart, God ſaith, go, <hi>the man that ſought thy life is dead;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Moſes</hi> though thou wilt not confeſs it, I know what troubleth thee, thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that the men that ſought thy life are alive in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when thou comeſt thither, thou ſhalt be executed. No, ſaith he, they are dead, he would have him reſt on him, and that would revive his heart, that he ſhould not be troubled and diſquieted. So you may ſee in other ſervants of God, that this was alwaies the reaſon of any indirect courſe they took: <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Rebecca,</hi> in that caſe; why did <hi>Rebecca</hi> uſe that device in getting the bleſſing with <hi>Jacob?</hi> Becauſe ſhe failed in her truſt in God, ſhe ſaw how ſhe was perplexed with the daughters of <hi>Heth, Eſaus</hi> wives, and many troubles that way; And <hi>Iſaac</hi> was dim-ſighted, and had many weakneſſes upon him, ſhe knew not how he might miſtake, and give the bleſſing to the other, therefore ſhe deviſeth a way to get the bleſſing, but ſhe got ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorrows; you know what a hard ſervice it coſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> and how many evils it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to, and all was, becauſe through fear, and diſquiet of heart, he caſt not himſelf upon God in his way, but they would find out wayes of their own.</p>
               <p>It ſhould teach us in all diſquiet of ſpirit,
<note place="margin">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
                  </note> to look principally to the ſtrengthening of <pb n="363" facs="tcp:47453:189"/>our faith. This is called a <hi>ſhield,</hi> Eph. 6. when all the darts of temptation that fire the ſoul, and perplex it many wayes, are caſt upon a man; here is a ſhield to preſerve and keep him ſafe. Therefore let us ever have this for our uſe whoſe and found. You ſhall find that even the ſervants of God have ſo far been in a comfortable eſtate, as they have been in the exerciſe of their faith.</p>
               <p>Take <hi>David</hi> for an example, when <hi>Ziglag</hi> was burnt, and his Wives, and ſervants, and goods, and cattel, were all carryed away, and the Souldiers in the rage of their hearts, and diſcontent, began to think of ſtoning of him, yet faith the Text, <hi>Then David comforted himſelf in the Lord his God;</hi> When there was no comfort in his Souldiers about him, or in thoſe that were neer him, every thing was taken away, at this time <hi>David</hi> comforts himſelf in the Lord his God. So <hi>Job,</hi> ſee how quiet his heart is, and well ſatisfied, when he reſted on God, in the greateſt occaſions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, his goods was carried away, his ſons were ſlain, all added to <hi>Jobs</hi> miſery, but he comes to this; <hi>The Lord hath given and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the Lord;</hi> when he can look above the creature to God, and ſettle his heart upon this rock, he finds comfort in it.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the ſervants of God are never out of trouble, and diſquiet when they neglect this, as the Diſciples in the tempeſt upon the Sea, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. they cry out they are utterly undone; <hi>Save Maſter:</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Oh ye of little faith!</hi> The not exerciſing of their faith did ſo perplex and diſquiet them as it did, and if you look upon all the complaints of the lives of men, for the loſs of ſuch friends, and the decay of trading, for the ill dealing of Cuſtomers, for ſickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Men are always complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. What is the reaſon? Becauſe they place too much hope and confidence in the creature; they look not above theſe things with the eye of faith, and hence comes that diſturbance, and diſquiet, if the outward means be taken from them, they look not upon that God that hath all means and opportunities in his own hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me.</hi>
                  <lb/>
                  <hi>They that would have their hearts quiet by beleeving in God ſhould eſpecially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe faith in reſting on Chriſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> 3. Faith that quiets the ſoul, muſt be pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon God in Chriſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beleeve in me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, for the heart of man flies off from God; Alas, the Lord is holy, and I am a ſinful man, he is righteous, and I am ſinful, who ſhall come before this holy and righteous God? Now when faith can look upon Chriſt, and ſet him between God and me, and look on God through him, now the ſoul reſts, he looks on God as a Father through Chriſt his Son; when the ſoul looks on Chriſt, as my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band married to me, as my head, and I am united to him as a member, as my Lord that hath taken me into his protection, when the ſoul thus looks on Chriſt, now it looks upon God in all his attributes, wondrous glorious, and comfortable to the ſoul. This is the thing that I can but touch at this time; There are two things conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is no ground of repoſing the ſoul upon God, but by beleeving in Chriſt, he is the Mediatour. Therefore in <hi>John</hi> 8.24. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Except you beleeve, that I am he whom the Father ſent, you ſhall die in your ſins.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> they did beleeve in God, they were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and worſhipped the God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and beleeved in God; but, ſaith he, except you beleeve in me, that I am he that God hath ſent as Mediatour; <hi>you ſhall die in your ſins.</hi> And ſo in this Chapter; <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh to the Father, but by me;</hi> there is no other way to the Father. That as the high Prieſt under the law was <hi>in all things pertaining to God,</hi> he was between God and the people. So Chriſt our great high Prieſt is in all things that concern the glory of God, and the ſalvation of man, and the acceptance of a ſinner, in all things between God and us; Here is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is worth our conſideration, how Chriſt comes to be thus, he was willing to die, a curſed, a ſhameful, and cruel death of the Croſs, and to be deſpiſed and abaſed, and all this for man, and yet Chriſt crucified is deſpiſed, and ſcorned in the world, <pb n="364" facs="tcp:47453:190"/>therefore if ever you will have acceptance of God, <hi>beleeve in me,</hi> [<hi>In me</hi>] that am now going from you; that am to be taken away by a curſed ignominious death: Here is another truth then,<lb/>
                  <hi>They that believe in Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>muſt believe in Chriſt abaſed, and Crucified, as well as in Chriſt in Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is a thing that fleſh and blood deſpiſeth, indeed all the World ſpeaks well of the profeſſion of the Faith, and believing in Chriſt, when Chriſt is in triumph, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering to conquer:</hi> every man glories in Chriſtians, but when Chriſtianity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is cryed down in the world, when Chriſt is Crucified, when all the World ſpeaks ill of the wayes of Chriſt, and of <hi>the obedience of Faith;</hi> now to obey a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, ſcorned, deſpiſed Chriſt in the ſight of the world, to reſt on him in the midſt of his abaſement, this will comfort the heart of a man in the times of the greateſt trouble, there is great reaſon it ſhould be thus.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt is the Almighty Glorious God in the midſt of his abaſement, his Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was not a whit abated, nor his Divine Excellencies diminiſhed by all his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; you ſee Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, he caſt Devils out of men, and they obeyed him; <hi>The Devils were ſubject unto him,</hi> when he converſed among men in the body; nay on the Croſs he ſaved the Thief that confeſſed him in the ſight of all his Enemies, when he was a crucified Chriſt, at that inſtant he triumphed on the very Croſs, and ſaved a ſinner that believed at that time, to ſhew that he was as mighty on the Croſs, as he is now at the right hand of the Father.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, is not Chriſts glory a whit diminiſhed in his abaſement? why ſhould our belief be abated for all the ſcorn and deſpite of the world that is caſt upon the profeſſion of the Faith of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Now briefly ſome Application of this, and ſo to take in the reſt withont amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe the time is paſt.</p>
               <p>It ſhould teach us in all diſquiet,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
                  </note> to know what courſe is to be taken; every one will ſay, I reſt upon God, there is ſufficient in him to make me happy. But how ſhall I come to have intereſt in God? <hi>The well is deep,</hi> where is the bucket? what is the means to relieve my Soul, and to ſupply my wants? <hi>Believe in me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; let the Soul look on Chriſt immediatly as the Mediator between God and us: this is that I ſhould have ſpoken of, and a word of Exhortation to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>You will ſay,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt. Anſw.</hi> What it is to believe in Chriſt.</note> what is it to believe in Chriſt?</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that is done in this, is receiving Chriſt upon Gods offer of him, God offers Chriſt in all his Offices, as <hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> as a Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Church, and he would have men take whole Chriſt, or no part of him. Now if the Soul anſwer to this offer of God, he ſhall be my <hi>Lord</hi> to rule me, my <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> to inſtruct me, my <hi>Saviour</hi> upon whom my Soul ſhall reſt for Salvation; this is the anſwer of the Soul to God, this is the receiving.</p>
               <p>Now you muſt know there muſt be a right propounding, and a right apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt</p>
               <p>You muſt know firſt what it is to receive Chriſt as a Prophet, as one that will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us in the truths that are contrary to natural principles in the corrupt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of man, he will lead you now in the way of the Wilderneſs, in by-pathes, in crooked, rough wayes, he will teach you to <hi>deny your ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt rule that he gives,
<note place="margin">What it is to receive Chriſt as a Prophet.</note> is for a man to deny himſelf; as if he ſhould ſay, that is the firſt work: he dyed to pull down all the old frame, and to ſet it up again; for what is the underſtanding of man, but a frame of falſe principles? for the natural mind of man, it is nothing but a habit, a heap, a pile of falſe principles, that every man periſheth by the deluſion of his own underſtanding; now the firſt work of Chriſt is to diſſolve this frame, and to blot out theſe rules whereby men walk when they are lead by ſence, and natural reaſon, and obſervation of the world; now theſe muſt all be taken away, and a man muſt reſolve all now into the authority of Chriſts ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A word of Chriſt is enough againſt a thouſand examples in the world, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <pb n="305" facs="tcp:47453:190"/>a thouſand reaſons of a mans own corrupt heart. This is to receive Chriſt as a Prophet, when I will not walk by the rules of my deluded reaſon, and corrupt mind, after which I was carried before, but the Word of Chriſt ſhall carry me in all things, here is obedience of Faith in matter of Doctrine.</p>
               <p>And ſo to receive Chriſt as a King,
<note place="margin">As a King.</note> would you know what a King he is? he is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King, whoſe laws are all right, the Law of Faith is a righteous Law, and <hi>the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith</hi> muſt be obedience to righteouſneſs, that is righteous obedience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man labours more and more to perfect holineſs in the fear of God.</p>
               <p>Hence comes all that care to mortifie corruptions, and to frame the inward man to conform to thoſe rules that are taught by Chriſt as a Prophet; the ſoul receiving Chriſt as a King gives it ſelf to obey all the rules and directions that Chriſt in his Word as a Prophet hath leſt: and this it doth in faith, that is, looking upon his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that hath commanded it; for that is properly an act of faith when things are done upon this ground, upon the authority of him that hath revealed it, I believe it to be his will, becauſe he hath revealed it; and it is my duty, becauſe it is his will; Thus the ſoul reſolves all to Chriſt, as a Prophet and a King.</p>
               <p>And then it reſts on him as a Prieſt,
<note place="margin">As a Prieſt.</note> and comforts it ſelf in Spirit, now for a man when he wants comfort he muſt not ſeparate the offices af Chriſt, and ſay, I will reſt on Chriſt as a Prieſt; theſe are errours and deluſions. Shall a man be ſaved by a half Faith, by a peece of Faith? To look on Chriſt in one office, and to think to be ſaved only by that without concurring, and concomitating in the other offices? Beloved as Chriſt is entire in all his offices, ſo the faith of a believer is entire looking upon all his offices; therefore we muſt receive him as <hi>King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> that he may be <hi>wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> that he may be all to the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul, for preſent, and for future happineſs, elſe if Chriſt be not all, he will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; men muſt not pleaſe themſelves to look upon one office of Chriſt; and to neglect all the reſt.</p>
               <p>When this is done come to the main matter, the ſoul is beaten off; as when a man is in a Boat getting to land after ſhipwrack, there comes a ſtorm and beats him back again when he thinks he is even at the ſhoar, but ſtill he takes hold on the Boat and keeps his eye upon the ſhoar: So the ſoul when it comes to this to be beat off again, ſtill it keeps the ſhoar in its ſight, and directs it ſelf towards Chriſt, that ſhould be the end and aim of all a mans endeavours, the true object of faith; I beſeech you conſider this point.</p>
               <p>But a man will ſay,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi>
                  </note> though I be careful to receive him (I ſpeak of weak Chriſtians, or of ſtrong Chriſtians that are weakned by temptations) Alas what hope have I in Chriſt, Chriſt is in heaven, and I am upon the earth?</p>
               <p>Did Chriſt when he was upon the earth,

                     <p>By faith Abraham when he was tried, offered up his ſon Iſaac, and he that had received the promiſe offered up his onely begotten ſon.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Chapter doth ſpeak in the commendation of the Faith of many of the Patriarchs, and <hi>Abraham</hi> among the reſt is brought in, with a manifeſt teſtimony of his Faith: there be two things obſervable, which <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith ſtrengthened him to act, one was to give up his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the other was to give up his Son: to give up his Country in <hi>verſe</hi> 8. <hi>By Faith Abraham, when he was called of God, to go out in a place which he ſhould after receive for an inheritance, obeyed, and he went out not knowing whether he went.</hi> To leave our friends, our parents, to take our journey we know not whither, to live among we know not whom, and all this upon a bare word; this was not an eaſie thing, to part with good Land for ſome good words; this was a hard matter, ſence derides it, and reaſon contemns it, and will not hearken to it, but Faith can ſee more in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, than ſence can find. <hi>Abraham</hi> will leave his Country, when God calls him to it, but never ſhall loſe his inheritance by beleeving and obeying: no man did ever yet hazard his eſtate, who could part with it upon obedient terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:47453:192"/>A ſecond thing that he is to part with, is with his Son, his only ſon, his firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſon, in this Act of faith; <hi>Abraham</hi> ſails againſt wind and tide, where he breaks through the contentments of the world, not only of ſence and reaſon, but of natural affection. The ſtory in a word is this, God after many years patience, at length gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſon in his old age, he was the child of many prayers, and of many teares, the parents delight, and to <hi>Abrahams</hi> thinking an heir of life, becauſe a child of the Promiſe; he had not long ſpent his gray hairs in a ſtrange land, but God on a ſudden calls upon <hi>Abraham</hi> to give back his ſon, his very ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as we may read in the 22 of Geneſis. Now what doth <hi>Abraham</hi> do? how doth he behave himſelf? doth he expoſtulate with God? Any thing, Lord but ſpare my ſon <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Nay, the Text ſaith, <hi>he offered up his ſon;</hi> Doth he murmure and grumble againſt God in this manner; Lord why doſt thou ſingle out this delight of mine? why doſt thou ſeem to envy this bleſſing of mine? <hi>No he offered up his Iſaac;</hi> as if the Text had expreſſed <hi>Ahrahams</hi> language thus; O Lord my God, what is it that thou calleſt for? whom is it that thou calleſt for? is it for my only ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the ſon of my love, the ſon of thy promiſe, the ſon of my age? verily Lord thou ſhalt have him; it is true, I love him dearly well, but I love thee better; I got him by beleeving, and I ſhall never loſe him by obeying; if <hi>Iſaac</hi> were a thouſand ſons thou ſhouldeſt have them all, though I am a father, yet Lord thou art a God, if I give him, he is a ſacrifice acceptable, and though I kill him, yet thou canſt quicken him and raiſe him again; I ſhall never loſe my <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though I part with my ſon, for thou haſt ſaid, <hi>in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the parts of theſe words are two;
<note place="margin">Deviſion of the words.</note> Firſt, we have <hi>Abrahams</hi> great try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we have <hi>Abrahams</hi> acquitment.</p>
               <p>Firſt his tryal, <hi>Abraham was tried when he offered up his ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly his acquitment, <hi>by Faith Abraham offered up his ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the former we may obſerve three particulars;</p>
               <p>Firſt, the perſon that is tried, <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Perſon that tried him, God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the thing wherein he was tried, it was no ordinary thing, it was to part with a part of himſelf, to offer up his dear ſon <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the latter part two things are obſervable;</p>
               <p>Firſt, his quickening up himſelf in his obediential act, <hi>he offered up Iſaac,</hi> ſaith the Text.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the powerful cauſe which did inable <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſo difficult a work; <hi>By faith Abraham when he was tried offered up his ſon, and he that had received the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe offered up his only begotten ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I cannot handle all theſe parts by ſeveral peeces as they lye, therefore I will deliver to you the juyce and ſubſtance of all that I have to ſay, in two Propoſitions, there might be many more collected from theſe words, but I will ſpeak of no more, the firſt is this;</p>
               <p>That ſtrong and great trials may befal ſtrong and great Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Propoſition is this;</p>
               <p>That faith will make a man acquit himſelf in great trials. Now for the firſt.<lb/>
                  <hi>That ſtrong and great trials may befal ſtrong and great Chriſtians.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct</hi> 1. Strong trials befall ſtrong Chriſtians.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Text clears it in <hi>Abraham,</hi> about his ſon, his only ſon, a great trial, there are ten remarkable ſteps in this trial of <hi>Abraham</hi> in oftering up his Son.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1.</note> had it been to part with a dutiful ſervant, this had been ſomething, but to part with a Son, this is much more, this we know that the relation of a ſervant is much leſs then that of a child.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2.</note> if he had been to part with a faithful friend, ſuch a one as <hi>Jonathan</hi> was to <hi>David,</hi> this would have tried him, but to part with a tender <hi>Iſaac,</hi> this is much more.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">3.</note> if it were an adopted ſon that he were to part with, it were not ſo much, <pb n="369" facs="tcp:47453:192"/>but to part with a natural ſon, one that was a part of himſelf, a part of his own body.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">4.</note> if he were a ſon amongſt many more, but he muſt part with his only ſon, his only ſon <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">5.</note> if <hi>Abraham</hi> had been young, and might have enjoyed another ſon, it had not been ſo much, but he is the only ſon of his old age.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">6.</note> if it were the ſon of his old age, if it had been an <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> this had not been ſo much, but his only ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a child of promiſe, and of prayer, a child of many tears.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">7.</note> if it had been a ſon wherein he took no great delight, that his affections were not ſo much ſet upon, it had not been ſo much, but it was the ſon of his love; he muſt not onely part with his only ſon, and the only ſon of his old age, but his only ſon whom he loved.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">8.</note> if it were but only to part from him, to have him taken away, this had not been ſo much, but he muſt kill his ſon, he muſt cut his ſon all in peeces, and ſo offer him up to God, wherein his heart might have diſputed with that ſinful act of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">9.</note> if another had been to do it to cut his ſon in peeces, but <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt do it himſelf, the tender Father muſt take away the life of his tender child.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">10.</note> it had not been ſo great; if <hi>Abraham</hi> had been to do it preſently, or neer to ſome of his friends, that might have hindered him from this Act; but <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> muſt go three dayes journey, and muſt go to an unknown place, and there muſt pour out the heart and bloud, and life of his <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe many particulars we may ſee the greatneſs of <hi>Abrahams</hi> trial; O the heighth and depth, and bredth of this trial, no one could impoſe ſuch a trial, but a God, and none could anſwer ſuch a trial but an <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> may come in as another inſtance,
<note place="margin">Job 1.8.</note> God gives <hi>Job</hi> this teſtimony, that he was an eminent perſon, <hi>None like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, and one that feared God, and eſchewed evil;</hi> He ſeemed to be the talleſt Cedar, and yet he had the ſharpeſt winds, his eminency in grace, would not deliver him from trouble, he is tried many wayes, in the loſs of his cattel, and then in the loſs of his ſervants, and then in the loſs of his children, and in the loſs of all his children at once, and all on a ſudden, and at ſuch a time, the time of his greateſt proſperity: he is tried by his neer friends, condemned for an hypocrite, and by his own wife contemned, and tempted to curſe God; and he was tried by God himſelf, <hi>He wrote bitter things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him,</hi> and faſtened his arrowes in his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>But to leave theſe inſtances, let me crave leave a little to touch upon two things for the full and cleer opening of this point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will ſhew you wherein the ſtrength of a trial may conſiſt.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly,
<note place="margin">Wherein the ſtrength of a trial conſiſts.</note> I will ſhew you, why God is pleaſed to lay ſtrong and great trials, upon ſtrong and great Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Firſt, wherein the ſtrength of a trial may confiſt, and I will obſerve ſix things which may make a trial great.</p>
               <p>Firſt, one is the goodneſs, and kindneſs of the agent that deals with us, when any neer to us in a ſingular relation to us, ſhall ſeem to turn againſt us, and ſpoil us, and perſecute us, when a dear friend ſhall prove a bitter enemy; O this is a heavy trial, no ſword cuts ſo ſharp as this, nothing makes a greater wound then this; when God himſelf ſhall ſeem to reject: He who had ſaid thus much, I will be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and I will bleſs thee, and multiply thy ſeed, and yet now to command him a <hi>Duel</hi> with his ſon: for a man to meet with a condition of trouble and ſorrow, when he expects all mercy and compaſſion, and tenderneſs of love; O this doth cauſe ſingular ſorrow: to meet with waves in the middeſt of the Ocean, it is a common thing, but to thruſt the ſhip into ſome harbour, and there to meet ſhipwark, O this is very much: for a Chriſtian to find ſcorns, and hard uſage from the world, this is but an ordinary thing; but when he looks up to heaven, and receives ſuch looks and frowns from God, that fetch tears from his eyes, and from his heart, this is much more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:47453:193"/>Secondly, the ſtrength of a tryal may conſiſt in the neerneſs of an object, when the tryal is not that which rends the garment, but rends the heart; for a woman to loſe her ring, is not ſo much, but to loſe her husband, this is much more; for a man to loſe an outward thing is ſomething, but to loſe a child is much more; this many times is the renting of the loyns a ſunder, for <hi>David</hi> to loſe a ſervant is not ſo much, but when <hi>David</hi> loſes <hi>Abſalom,</hi> then he cries out, <hi>O Abſalom, my ſon, would God I had dyed for thee. O Abſalom my ſon, my ſon.</hi> God is pleaſed many times to try his ſervants, <hi>by taking away the delight of their eyes, and the joy of their heart,</hi> and the hope of their lives.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the ſtrength of a tryal may conſiſt in the neerneſs of a comfort, a tryal is ſtrongeſt when it ſeems to pluck away the thing that is neereſt the heart, when God plucks away a Child ſucking at the breaſt, when he takes away that whereon our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is fixed; when God on a ſudden, doth take away and couſume the Gourd that ſhadowed <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he ſnatches away the thing that we take content in; O this will enter to the quick, and greatly amaze us, when out affection is placed, and ſetled in a deſigned object, in a perſon that we neerly love, and now to take away that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and as it were to diverſe the heart from the heart; O this goes neer us, this doth exceedingly trouble a perſon.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ſtrength of a tryal may conſiſt in the ſuddenneſs of it, to enjoy a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and on a ſudden to have it taken away as it were in a mans ſleep, ſuch a thing that he did not dream of, when he did not expect that ſuch a thing would befal him, if a man had heard ſomething before hand, he might have been better fitted for it; When the Prophet ſaw the Cloud aſcend out of the Sea, being warned of abundance of rain, he haſtened to eſcape. So if a perſon have fore-notice of ſuch a croſs that would fall upon him, he might be ſomewhat armed and prepared, he might in ſome meaſure be able to bear his tryal, like a little Boat well mannaged may meet with lofty waves, but when the affliction ſhall take a man at unawares, when it takes us before we can gather our ſelves together, before we can put out our ſelves in prayer; for a man to go forth, and come home and find a wife dead, and for a Woman to go forth, and come home and find her Husband dead: for a tender Mother to kiſs her child, and lay it down to reſt, and the next turn to find her child dead; this is a great tryal.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the ſtrength of a tryal is in the ſucceſſiveneſs of a tryal, the repetition of a tryal, when <hi>Jobs</hi> meſſengers come with news of one affliction, having ſcarſe delivered their meſſage, and their errand, but another comes, when there is a courſe of tryal one after another; <hi>Thou, O Lord, haſt ſet me as a mark,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job;</hi> Why a mark? why God had, as it were, ſingled him a man for ſorrow and tryal, one arrow had no ſooner lighted on him, but another comes and pierces him; Now this doth deeply prove our patience, and makes us ſometime wonder, that the Lord ſhould give us no reſt, when one affliction ſhall ſucceed another, without any Cordial when the handkerchiff ſhall no ſooner wipe off one tear, but preſently another diſtills down; Herein is a great ſtrength of tryal, the heart is wonderfully caſt down.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, the ſtrength of a tryal may conſiſt in the ſtrangeneſs of our obedience to it, as when a matter is put upon us as a duty to be obeyed, and hath ſome contradiction to the precept of God: when a tryal doth croſs the precept of obedience, and juſsle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the promiſe of God, that a man can hardly obey God, but he muſt make God a lyar. <hi>Abraham</hi> could not have obeyed God in killing his Child, but he muſt run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that other command, forbidding murther; he could not defer it, but he muſt violate his faith; Now this doth exceedindly diſtract the Soul with a great tryal, the more contrary the tryal is to the precept of obedience, the greater is the tryal, and the more neer to the perſon. But I proceed to the next queſtion.</p>
               <p>Why the Lord doth impoſe great tryals upon great Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">Why God lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtrong try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, on ſtrong Chriſtians.</note> the reaſons of it may be theſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, great grace will be obſcure, and will ſcarce ſhew it ſelf, unleſs there be great tryals;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was lift up to the third heavens, leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure, there was given him <hi>a thorne in the fleſh,</hi> he is beaten down with temptation, that the grace of God might the more appear. God doth hereby <pb n="371" facs="tcp:47453:193"/>prevent our fall,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> and doth hold great grace in great conflicts, that the ſoul might have little leiſure to admire its own fulneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, great tryals for great Chriſtians, becauſe who is more able to ſuſtain grear tryals then great Chriſtians? God is wiſe in all his actions; and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in another caſe, there was milk for babes, and meat for ſtrong men; ſo when he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes any affliction, he conſiders the perſon, and ſo proportions the affliction: he impoſes the greateſt burden, upon the greateſt Chriſtian, a little blaſt is enough for a tender oak, but a well grounded one may endure the ſtrongeſt winds: a poor weak Chriſtian, a little tryal will caſt him down, but a well experienced Chriſtian that hath inriched himſelf with the promiſes of God, that hath hardned himſelf with the receit of ſingular comforts, one that knoweth the life of faith, that hath gotten ſingular pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, he can endure a hard ſtorm, he can go through great tryals with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; He can ſay with <hi>Job, though thou doſt kill me, yet will I truſt in thee;</hi> he will be able to go through many ſad nights, and great tryals, his faith will make him conquer all.</p>
               <p>I come to the ſecond point, and that is this; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>Faith will make a man acquit himſelf in great Tryals.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> Faith acquits a man in great tryals.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Though <hi>Abraham</hi> is put upon it, in a great tryal, in offering up his ſon, yet <hi>by faith Abraham</hi> acquits himſelf, and <hi>offers up his beloved ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The meaning of the propoſition is this, that faith will inable a man to give back his deareſt comfort again to God, though <hi>Iſaac</hi> lie in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, though <hi>Iſaac</hi> lie at <hi>Abrahams</hi> heart, yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith upon Gods call will take him thence, and preſent him to that God who gave him.</p>
               <p>Faith makes a man reſign up willingly unto God his deareſt comfort, as <hi>Job</hi> did; <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> Beloved, remember this, faith can take a mercy and be thankful, and faith can part with a mercy and be content. <hi>Paul</hi> he had <hi>learned how to abound, and how to be in want;</hi> and this leſſon was the leſſon of faith: faith makes a Chriſtian take from Chriſt, what it injoyes, like one of the bleſſed Martyrs, his condition was, if God gave him any mercy, he was chearful; if the Lord take away any mercy, he fits down with contentment, quieting his ſoul in patience, if God give him any mercy, he was not ſwoln with pride; if God take away any mercy, he was not caſt down with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Doſt thou remember me, O Lord; ſaith faith: Lord I am unworthy the leaſt of all thy mercies and goodneſs. Lord doſt thou call for this bleſſing back again? why here it is Lord, do what thou pleaſeſt; like an honeſt debtor, ſaith he, if you can ſpare me a little, I will thank you, but if you will have it, here it is; as the bleſſing is a gift of Gods kindneſs, ſo neither doth faith account of any mercy, but a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a lent good which God may require when he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>There is a double acquitting of our ſelves, one is a neceſſary acquitting, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a pious, and Chriſtian acquitting: there is this difference between a godly man, and another, when God calls for any one of thy comforts, it muſt be reſtored, God is the Lord of life, and whether we are willing or not, when he calls, the comfort and we muſt part, and in this reſpect a man who wants a lively faith, may acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a tryal, when he ſees that floods of tears will not help him, ſpecially when he ſees it is paſt recovery, he reſigns up a comfort, when he can keep it no longer, he will part with a bleſſing when he cannot avoid it. But then there is a pious acquitting of our ſelves, when God calls for a comfort back, the hand of Faith preſents the comfor to God again, when God calls for <hi>Iſaac, Abraham</hi> preſently reſigns up his beloved Son again, upon this ground; God is the Lord who gave him, and now the Lord calls for him back again; I, and the Lord ſhall have him; thus Faith acquits the ſoul in great tryals, and joyns with God againſt all our own contentments, to ſet down with much patience in great loſſes, to ſubmit to Gods call, and Gods appointment.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſons why Faith can acquit a man in great tryals may be theſe.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> Firſt, Faith can exalt Gods will above all, and ſubmit our wills to Gods will, remember this. God is the Author of mercy, when he will he gives us, and when he pleaſeth, he takes <pb n="372" facs="tcp:47453:194"/>it away again. It is well to have abundance, ſaith nature, and ſence, we cannot be without it: no ſaith Faith, I will yeeld to Gods will, it is good to enjoy this ſaith Sence; it is better to part with it, ſaith Faith, when God calls for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> Faith can give God the glory of all outward comforts; this is a great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſtilling our ſouls, to find out the right owner of our comforts; if a man did once diſcern that by faith, that God is the Author of all comfort, and that all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies come from God, this would make us ſubmit in the day of tryal: this is certain, God is the God of our bodies, and of our ſouls, and of our comforts; who hath more right to a poſſeſſion then the owner, all our comforts are but Gods ſervants, God is the great Land-Lord of heaven and earth, the God of all our poſſeſſions; what if he be pleaſed to gather a flower, we are but tenants at will, and whatſoever our outward eſtate is, Faith over-looks all, and ſubmits all to God, and receives it by Gods permiſſion, and doth as it were hear the Lord ſay, I muſt do what I will with mine own; Faith makes a man ſay, nothing is mine own, my Child is not mine own, my Wife is not mine own, it is Gods poſſeſſion, when God calls for it; Faith reſigns it up as Gods due, faith <hi>renders unto God, the things that are Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.</note> Faith can make the ſoul acquit it ſelf in great tryals, becauſe faith finds no loſs by obediencial ſubmiſſion, for all our unwillingneſs to reſign up, and to part with any comfort, it doth ariſe from infidelity, or from the ſtubbornneſs that is in a perſon, when a man haves and holds his comfort contrary to Gods will; or elſe it doth ariſe from a conceit that ſome dammage will redound to our ſelves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>parting with ſuch a bleſſing, but faith ſees ſafety enough to yeeld up all into Gods hands, who is <hi>the Father of mercy, and God of all conſolation.</hi> Thus we ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> being put to it about his only ſon, he gives up his child, his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and God beſtows <hi>Iſaac</hi> upon <hi>Abraham</hi> again; nay, a further degree of bleſſing confirmed with an oath; <hi>In bleſſing, I will bleſs thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thee, and will multiply thy ſeed as the ſtars of heaven;</hi> This is ever true; faith makes a man give back a bleſſing with this concluſion, either God will continue the comfort to a perſon, or elſe he will give him more, or a better for it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4.</note> a fourth reaſon why Faith can make a man acquit himſelf in great tryals, becauſe Faith can find all loſſes made up in God alone; Faith can find God as a moſt ample and univerſal good; Faith doth look upon God as a particular good, and ſuch a good that anſwers all again, that abundantly makes up all loſſes: There be many broken peeces of comfort that muſt concur to make up our outward good; for our good here below is a compounded good, the Wiſe is a part that makes up our good below; and our children are a part that makes up our good below, and our health, and our riches, and our friends; many of theſe concur together, to make up our good here below is a compounded good, the Wife is a part that makes up our good below; and our children are a part that makes up our good below, and our health, and our riches, and our friends; many of theſe concur together, to make up our good below: but God is all this in himſelf, and much more, whatſoever good, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever comforts, are in a Child, a Wife, a Husband, or in friends, in riches, in health, all that is in God, and much more to faith: what is that thou ſeeſt in a Husband, or in a Wife, or in a Child, that thou mayeſt not ſee in God? What is that thou findeſt in a friend, that thou mayeſt not find in God? and what is there in riches, that thou mayeſt not have much more in God? the Husband can do thee no good without God, who can do thee ſo much good as God? the Husband can comfort thee, who can comfort thee ſo much as God? a friend may counſel thee, and direct thee, but he cannot deliver thee; Faith ſees more in God than in riches, more in God then in all outward bleſſings; bring all the outward comforts together, they cannot make up a Chriſtians comfort; Faith is never ſatisfied with theſe things, it is not a Child a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, nor a Husband alone, nor a Wife alone, nor a friend alone, that makes up a Chriſtians comfort, but God alone can do it; whatſoever is in any outward comfort Faith find it much more in God, God and his favour, God and his gracious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, theſe make up a Chriſtians comfort, this alone ſupports the Chriſtian, and in the want of all things Faith can comfort it ſelf in the favour of God; in the loſs of all things, Faith can find all again in the favour of God. This is a fourth reaſon why Faith makes a man acquit himſelf in great Tryals.</p>
               <p>A fifth reaſon,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5.</note> why Faith makes a man acquit himſelf in great troubles, becauſe Faith knows upon what terms we poſſeſs all theſe outward comforts, upon what <pb n="373" facs="tcp:47453:194"/>ſmall grounds we poſſeſs them; upon moveable and changeable titles. Faith looks upon all theſe things, as upon things that he muſt part from; we have here no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding City, our place and being here is but for a ſhort time, and remember this, God never beſtowed any comfort upon thee and me, with an aſſurance of an immortal poſſeſſion, all the aſſurance that he hath given thee is nothing, all the creature is but vanity, it is of a ſhifting nature, and therefore it is ſaid of <hi>riches,</hi> that <hi>they do take to themſelves wings,</hi> they skip away, honour is ſoon gone, riches are ſoon gone, the life of man is ſoon gone, the life of man is but a breath, a vapour which is preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, but a glaſs of a brittle ſubſtance, all our comforts are of a changeable nature; that whereon we ſet our affection, is taken from us in a moment.</p>
               <p>Thus I have opened theſe two points, now give me leave to make ſome uſe; I will ſpare to ſpeak to you of the occaſion of our meeting together, for <hi>Funeral Sermons</hi> are not for the advantage of the dead, but for the inſtruction of the living: there are two Uſes that I will make of thoſe two propoſitions; I know many more may be produced, but I conſider the time.</p>
               <p>The firſt Uſe is this; Since great tryals may befal great Chriſtians, then let us prepare for great tryals,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> for as much as ſuch kind and degrees of affliction and croſſes may beſal us. There are two things that a man ſhould alwaies provide for, one is while we live to provide for Death; the other is while we are in proſperity, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for affliction, for a change: and for this conſider two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt our outward condition is but a ſhadow, it hath a natural aptneſs to change, there is not a perſon that hears me this day, but this may concern his outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Man is born unto trouble,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, as the ſparks fly upward;</hi> as if trouble were his natural ſphear wherein he is to move.</p>
               <p>Thou canſt not aſſure thy ſelf of life, no not a moment; nor of any of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, neither canſt thou promiſe thy ſelf ſecurity in any ſtate or condition, though thou maiſt get aſſurance that God wil ſave thee, yet thou canſt never get aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that God will never try thee; we ſee that Death enters into many houſes of this City at this time; in one houſe, one hath loſt a Father, another hath loſt a Wife, another hath loſt a Husband, another hath loſt a Child, another is in ſorrow for the loſs of a dear friend; and therefore we ſhould provide for a change, becauſe the next commiſſion of Death, may enter into our houſes; it is our ſins that puts our lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe conditions; our ſins do alwayes leave ſomething contrary to our comforts, to alter and change our preſent condition, Death takes away our life, and plucks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our comfort, and diſ-inherits us of all theſe outward things; how ſoon doth Death lay honour in the duſt? how ſoon is beauty ecclipſed by deformity? our ſtrength laid down by weakneſs? our health overcome by ſickneſs, our life overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Death? all theſe may ecclipſe our comforts, theſe clouds may ſoon darken our ſun; one thing or other every moment is ready to put out our candle, to darken our day, to ceaſe our life; alas what is life but a ſhadow? What is honour but a blaſt? what are the things we do ſo much pride our ſelves in? they are but as <hi>Jonahs</hi> Gourd, which periſheth in a moment, and many times the cauſe of our ſorrow and affliction; the loſs of them a greater griefe then the want of them, this ſtaffe on which we lean will ſoon be broken; a Ship may laſt for a while, but ſhe will ſink at the laſt. What is the Wife mans verdict of all things under the Sun? he concludes they are <hi>all vanity;</hi> that is not enough, they are <hi>nothing but vanity;</hi> that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough neither, they are <hi>nothing but vanity, and vexation of ſpirit,</hi> things leſs then nothing: then how little is it that we are to expect from them? we ſhould provide for a change; not only our outward condition is thus changeable, but our inward condition too; our ſpiritual comfort is changeable, though there is ſtability in the main, yet a Chriſtian meets with many intermiſſions. Beloved, if our condition were not changeable, I would hold my tongue from exhorting you to provide for a change.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as our outward condition is caſt upon many changes, ſo when theſe changes do befal us, when they come to ſtrip us of our comfort, verily they will put us to it. Thou art miſtaken, thou thinkeſt thou canſt bear a loſs, or a croſs, it is not ſo eaſie a matter to bear the loſs of a Child; or a Husband, or a Wife, or a Father, <pb n="374" facs="tcp:47453:195"/>or the loſs of a dear friend; it is not ſo eaſie a thing to bear the loſs of an eſtate, as thou thinkeſt, thou ſhalt find it a hard matter to bear in worldly ſorrow, we may ſeem to take courage before affliction comes, but when afflictions and trials fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, then we are put to it: it is with us, as with a Ship, when the Sun doth ſhine, and the Seas are calm, and the Wind fair, then ſhe goes on pleaſantly in her motion, but in a ſtorm all little enough to keep her ſteady: in our eaſie dayes, in our dayes of peace, in our calm eſtate, then we can hold up our heads well enough; but in our loſſes and croſſes, we ſhall hardly bear up, unleſs the Lord do mightily ſupport us.</p>
               <p>We may obſerve two ſorts of perſons in the world,
<note place="margin">1.</note> ſome are inſenſible perſons, who are like the Rock that nothing can break it; who are ſo hardened, that though God do ſcourge them, yet they feel it not, though God doth threaten them, they fear not, though Gods hand be already upon them, they regard it not; a condition not ſo much now to be checked, as to be deplored. To ſuch perſons it is all one, whether God bleſs, or whether God curſe; whether he ſpeak by his Word, or by his Rod, it is all one to them, they feel nothing, nor fear nothing.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2.</note> there is another ſort of perſons, who are ſenſible perſons, ſenſible of Gods love, and ſenſible of Gods anger; they know that God is good and wife, that he doth not ſtrike off our comforts from us, but upon ſome ſpecial cauſe. Now to ſtay upon God, and to yeeld to the Lord; <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeems good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</hi> God doth not deprive me of ſuch a comfort, but he ſees it beſt for me. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, it were good to learn this leſſon, it will coſt thee ſomething in a neer trial, to acquit thy ſelf by faith, to acquit God, and to ſubmit to his chaſtiſement, to kiſs the rod, to judg the ſin, to bend the ſoul, to better the life, this were an excellent leſſon to learn in all our trials and afflictions.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2.</note> if great trials may befall great Chriſtiaus, and faith is that which will make a man acquit himſelf in great trials; then get faith, uſe faith. What faith is, I have divers times diſcovered in this aſſembly, whence it comes, from heaven, how we may attain it, by the word and Prayer; but to omit theſe, I ſay get faith, labour for this grace of faith, if there were no other reaſon but this, it is able to ſupport us in our dayes of trial, it is able to give us comfort in our greateſt ſorrow; this were motive enough to make us labour to get faith, the day of trial being ſo common, and we apt every moment to fall under ſome trial or other.</p>
               <p>There be four vertues and ſpecial effects that faith works in the ſoul, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to go through great trials, and therefore we ſhould labour to get this grace of faith into our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Firſt, faith gets aſſurance; Secondly, breeds ſubmittance; Thirdly, dependance; and laſtly, conveyance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, faith gets aſſurance, it can eye God as our God, though the ſtorms be very great, yet God can quiet it. When a man though he ſees his outward comfort dead, yet Faith ſees it in the hand of a living God; Faith aſſures the ſoul, God will put an end to the trial, though there be a changeableneſs in the outward condition, yet there is ſafety in God, and ſetledneſs in God. Though a man may look with a dull eye upon his loſs, yet if he can look upon God with the eye of faith, as his God, the abſence of a poor creature cannot ſo much trouble him, as the preſence of a gracious, and a glorious God, can comfort and ſupport him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſubmittance is another effect of faith, which faith works in the ſoul: our outward condition is ſubject to many changes, and many times we meet with them, and we are hindered in our comforts, and naturally we grow impatient, and murmur and quarrel with Gods providence; but now there is a vertue in faith, it faſhions the heart, and the mind to the condition, faith makes a man ſubmit to God in all eſtates, to make us ſtoop to our burthen, <hi>it is the Lord ſaith Eli.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. let him do what ſeems good unto him; and in the 39. <hi>Pſal.</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, becauſe the Lord did it.</hi> Obſerve this, unbelief makes a man dumb, and faith made <hi>David</hi> dumb. <hi>Zachary,</hi> becauſe he beleeved not the word that the Angel ſpake, he was dumb; and <hi>David</hi> becauſe he beleeved the word of the Lord, he was dumb; unbelief procures dumbneſs, as a judgment from <pb n="375" facs="tcp:47453:195"/>God, but faith makes a Chriſtian dumb from complaining, it quiets the ſoul in ſilence from murmuring againſt God, it doth not make a perſon dumb, as not to pray, and to praiſe God, but dumb in complaint. Good is the word of the Lord, ſaith Faith.</p>
               <p>A third effect of Faith is dependance, it will make a man truſt God in frowning dayes, <hi>though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him,</hi> ſaith Faith: we can never loſe any outward comfort, but Faith can find a better in God, though an outward loſs may come, yet Faith can make it up in God, in the want of an outward comfort it will truſt God; <hi>Lord what wait I for?</hi> ſaith <hi>David, truly my hope is in thee.</hi> Though the Chriſtian eſtate may be at ſome time moanful, yet at no time it is hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>A fourth effect, that Faith works is conveyance, it can convey ſomething to inable the ſoul to bear it up in all trials: as Faith is an active grace to inable the ſoul to the performance of duty; ſo Faith is a paſſive grace, to ſtrengthen the ſoul to ſuffer and bear affliction; <hi>To you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>it is given not only to beleeve, but alſo to ſuffer for his Name.</hi> Faith will call in ſtrength enough to bear affliction: we ſee many times a poor Chriſtian by the ſtrength of faith is able to bear a great loſs, and undergo a great trial. God is pleaſed to exerciſe a Chriſtian with great affliction, but Faith carries the ſoul along through all: remember this, Faith bears Gods trials, with Gods ſtrength, there is a power in Faith which exceeds all outward croſſes and loſſes; Faith draws ſtrength from the Promiſe, for there is no croſs nor affliction, but Faith can find a ſupport in the promiſe of deliverance. Faith makes a man ſee the affliction, as it were, come out of the hand of the Lord, out of the hand of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; Faith can convey comfort to the ſoul in affliction, by making it ſee the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment delivered from the hand of a wiſe and loving Father, that our chaſtiſement is for our profit, for our future advantage, and that this is ſent for our perſonal good: if thou couldeſt get but a ſenſible denyal of thy ſelf, and by faith ſee all things meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out by the Lord: this would make us with patience, take from God what he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes upon us; Faith will make a man conquer himſelf, it will ſilence all murmuring, and make the Soul bear its croſs with patience.</p>

               <p>Were this a meeting for the ſolemnization of a Marriage, I might further deſcan upon this plain-ſong, that ariſeth from the inference, of Mens honouring of Women. What have I ſaid, if it were a Marriage ſolemnity? ſurely, howſoever here be before our eyes, the eyes of our bodies, a viſible object of mortality; yet notwithſtanding, here is before us, an inviſible occaſion of rejoycing, as at a Marriage ſolemnity, to the eye of our ſoul, underſtanding, and faith: for while here we live in the world, Jeſus Chriſt our Spouſe, he hath his friends, <hi>friends of the Bridegroom,</hi> his Miniſters and meſſengers, that in his name come to us, woo us, uſe all the means that may be, to move us to accept of Chriſt for our Lord and Husband; When a man accepts of this offer, there is then the contract conſummated, in regard of the Mutual conſent that paſſeth between the one and the other; Chriſt having his Proxies here, we the Miniſters being for him; and every believing ſoul for himſelf. This contract con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth ſo long as here we remain in this world; when we depart, the body is laid in the <hi>Bride-bed,</hi> quietly to reſt, and ſleep, till the Bride-groom be pleaſed to come and awake his Spouſe, and it will be a bleſſed voyce that he ſhall come withal, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.</hi> As for the ſoul, that goeth immediatly to Chriſt, and is in his <hi>Fathers houſe</hi> with him; the <hi>Spouſe</hi> in that part, with her Husband the Lord Chriſt, enjoying an eternal, inviolable communion, and ſweet ſociety.</p>
               <p>But howſoever this is thus to the inviſible eyes of the ſoul, we now muſt look upon the object here before us; and anſwerably order out matter; and therefore with this touch I let paſs the inference, and come to the ſubſtance of the Text.</p>
               <p>You heard the <hi>ſum;</hi> you heard the <hi>parts.</hi> But we muſt hear proceed, <hi>Hueſteron</hi> and <hi>Proteron,</hi> and clean invert the order of the words, as I hope your ſelves will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, if you do but well mark the order and method: <hi>Life</hi> is in the laſt place; <hi>grace</hi> before it; the right, that cometh before it; and the extent of that right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all. I ſuppoſe therefore you will think that firſt it is meet, to lay forth the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge it ſelf, <hi>Life:</hi> and then to ſpeak of the ground of it: then of the right that we have; and then of the Extent of that right: and this order I purpoſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">The firſt branch of the Text: <hi>Explication</hi>
                  </note> therefore concerning the Priviledge it ſelf, <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For brevities ſake, I forbear to ſpeak much of the divers acceptations of <hi>life,</hi> and diſtinctions thereof, as it is in the <hi>Creatour, the only true God,</hi> Father, Son, and holy Spirit: or as it is the inviſible and glorious creatures, the <hi>Angels:</hi> or as it is in men, who are animated by a reaſonable ſoul: or as it is in thoſe creatures that are guided only by ſenſe, Beaſts, Fowl, Fiſh: or otherwiſe, as it Trees and Plants, that come forth out of the earth, having a vegetative life only.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:47453:197"/>The <hi>life</hi> here meant,
<note place="margin">1 What life it is that is here meant.</note> is that we call <hi>eternal life;</hi> conſiſting in our communion with Chriſt our Spouſe: and this is a life proper to the Saints; proper unto them, becauſe coming from the grace of God, extended unto them alone; proper unto them,
<note place="margin">Eternal life proper to the Saints.</note> becauſe they are <hi>heirs</hi> of it. And in this extent, there is a reſtraint; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the extent be in divers conſiderations, yet a reſtraint, a qualification; only believers, only found true Chriſtians, to them it is proper.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>life</hi> is to be conſidered, either in the Inchoation and beginning thereof; or in the conſummation and accompliſhment thereof.</p>
               <p>In regard of the Inchoation of this ſpecial <hi>life</hi> of the Saints,
<note place="margin">Begun in this world.</note> it is here begun in this world; <hi>I [now] live</hi> (faith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking even of this <hi>life</hi>) <hi>by the faith of the Son of God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal 2.20.</note> And <hi>the Juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> This life it is by Chriſts dwelling and living in us:

                  <hi>I now live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> faith the Apoſtle in the place before quoted.</p>
               <p>The other,
<note place="margin">Conſummated in the world to come.</note> it is in the world to come, and it is by a ſweet feeling and fruition; it is by our abiding with Chriſt, and living with him: in which reſpect, faith our Lord Chriſt, to the penitent believer upon the Croſs, <hi>This day</hi> (the very day that he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>ſhalt thou be [with me] in Paradiſe:</hi>

<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4.17</note> a communion with Chriſt: And the ſame Apoſtle, ſpeaking of thoſe Saints that ſhall be upon the earth at the very moment of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>when the dead</hi> (faith he) <hi>are raiſed, then ſhall we alſo that are alive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, be cought up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the ayr, and ſo ſhall we ever be</hi> [with the Lord.] Now then, mark, here you ſee the ſoul hath preſent communion with Chriſt upon the diſſolution of the body: and the body alſo ſhall have communion with him at the great day of the Reſurrection of all fleſh.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>life</hi> and communion with Chriſt is proper to the Saints, by vertue of their union with Chriſt; A miſtical union. For Chriſt the Son of God, he is <hi>life</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally in himſelf,
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.26.</note> 
                  <hi>for as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf.</hi> He is alſo <hi>Life</hi> communicatively, communicating life unto us;
<note place="margin">Joh. 6 33.</note> therefore he is ſaid to be the <hi>Bread of life,</hi> and in this ſence, becauſe he is <hi>that Bread which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. For conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the Saints have here conſolation, againſt the mortality and corruption whereto they are ſubject here in this world; wherein their condition is common with the condition of all; for that that befalleth one, may befall every one, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the outward eſtate and condition, <hi>All muſt die.</hi> Nay further, here is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation againſt the diſtreſſes, and afflictions, and preſſures, whereto the Saints are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject above others for their profeſſion ſake;
<note place="margin">2 Tim 3.12. Act 14.22.</note> in this very reſpect they are hated, they are perſecuted, <hi>all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution; and through many afflictions we muſt enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Where is now there comfort? ſurely this, that is ſet before us: you heard that natural men are <hi>dead while they live:</hi> but thoſe that are in Chriſt, do live while they may ſeem <pb n="380" facs="tcp:47453:198"/>to be dead; <hi>Jonah</hi> lived when he was caſt into the Sea, ſwallowed up by a Whale, and was even as it were in hell; ſo the Saints, though ſwallowed up as we may ſay, in the tempeſtuous ſea of this world by cruel Whales, yet notwithſtanding they ſtil live that life that is begun here in the world, whereof you heard before: And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11, 12. ſheweth plainly, that though they are <hi>given up unto death daily for Jeſus ſake,</hi> yet they are <hi>not deſtroyed,</hi> not clean ſwallowed up, but that they live in Chriſt, and that Chriſt liveth in them: <hi>We are perplexed, but not in deſpair; perſeouted, but not forſaken,</hi> &amp;c. And this is it that doth comfort them, both the fruition of that <hi>life</hi> that they have here; and their expectation of the accompliſhment, and fulneſs thereof in the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Now (my brethren) this is the rather to be obſerved of us, becauſe of all others, the Saints ſeem to be moſt ſubject to death. And the truth is, here is matter of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in regard of their happineſs, that notwithſtanding that condition whereto they are ſubject, there is a life they enjoy in this world; there is a better life prepared for them hereafter.</p>
               <p>And what can be more deſired? Life of all things elſe is moſt eſteemed: Men are ready in ſickneſs, and in other diſtreſſes, to ſpend all that they have (as the Woman that was troubled with the bloudy iſſue,

It is noted of the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was <hi>caught up to the third heaven,</hi> and ſaw but a glimps of this life, he did there ſee (they are his own words) <hi>unutterable matter,</hi>

               <p>It will be here ſaid,

               <p>My Text telleth you; It is ſtiled here, <hi>Grace of Life.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And this is briefly to be noted againſt that proud and arrogant poſition of our Adverſaries,
<note place="margin">

               <p>For our own parts,

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> it affordeth to us another ground of comfort, and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our unworthineſs: for as we are creatures, we are <hi>leſs than the leaſt of Gods mercies;</hi> but as we are mortal creatures, <hi>duſt and aſhes,</hi> much more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any favour; but as we are ſinful creatures, having provoked the Juſtice of God, moſt, moſt unworthy of any <hi>grace,</hi> of any <hi>life,</hi> moſt worthy of all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and vengeance, of eternal death and damnation. Where is now our hope? what ground ſhall we have that have nothing in our ſelves? ſurely this, the ground of this <hi>life,</hi> the grace of <hi>God.</hi> What God doth, he doth for himſelf, for <hi>his own names ſake;</hi> Grace is free.</p>
               <p>And theſe two joyned together, give evident demonſtration of God to be a God, in the thing that he doth confer upon thee, and in his dealing of it: the greatneſs of the gift that he doth give, and the freeneſs of it. For who can give life, but the God of life, that <hi>hath life in himſelf?</hi> And then again to do this altogether upon meer <hi>grace,</hi> upon <hi>his own good pleaſure;</hi> it is a divine property. And this is it that doth encourage us to come unto God, notwithſtanding our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>And in this reſpect in the ſecond place we have here a Uſe of inſtruction:
<note place="margin">

               <p>And finally,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 4.

               </p>
               <p>Thus from the priviledge in the ſecond part thereof,
<note place="margin">The third branch of the Text.</note> come we to the partakers of this priviledge.</p>
               <p>And firſt of the ſimple conſideration of it,
<note place="margin">The Saints have right to eternal life by inheritance.</note> 
                  <hi>Heirs,</hi> ſo that <hi>we come to a right unto that eternal life by inheritance;</hi> as we are <hi>Heirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So do the Texts before-noted expreſly ſet it forth, <hi>We are juſtified by his grace, that we ſhould be heirs of eternal life, Tit.</hi> 3.7. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth thanks to <hi>God</hi> for the Colloſſians, <hi>that he had made them partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> And our Lord when he doth give us poſſeſſion hereof, inducts us thereunto with this, <hi>inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, Mat.</hi> 25.34. take it by inheritance; here is your right.</p>
               <p>Now we may not think that this ground of right to our eternal inheritance cometh by our natural generation, for ſo <hi>we are</hi> heirs, and <hi>children of wrath,</hi> as the Apoſtle noteth in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. It cannot come by nature, for ſo it is Chriſts prerogative, the true, proper, natural Son of <hi>God;</hi> and thus (as the Apoſtle faith) <hi>God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him heir of all things, Heb.</hi> 1.2. but it is by another grace, whereby we are made children: A double grace in this reſpect: a grace of Adoption; and a grace of Regeneration. A grace of Adoption, for God giveth to us <hi>the ſpirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> whereby we are moved to cry and call, <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> and by this grace we are <pb n="382" facs="tcp:47453:199"/>children, and <hi>being children, we are heirs,</hi> Co-heirs, not only one with another, but (as it is there noted) <hi>heirs together with Chriſt,</hi> Co-heirs with him by vertue of this grace of Adoption. So likewiſe by the other grace of Regeneration, we are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified hereunto; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, chap. 1. verſe 3. bleſſeth <hi>God, Bleſſed be the God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again to an inheritance incorruptible, &amp;c.</hi> We are begotten to this inheritance.</p>
               <p>This might again be preſſed as a further Argument againſt the fore-mentioned preſumptious Doctrine of Merit:

               <p>And particularly concerning the Female Sex (becauſe the Apoſtle here applyeth it to them,
<note place="margin">Particular.</note> and ſaith of them as well as of men, that they are Heirs, Co-heirs of the ſame inheritance) this therefore is to be applyed to them, for when the Apoſtle makes diſtinction of outward conditions, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. he putteth in this, <hi>Male and Female,</hi> and of theſe he ſaith, <hi>All are one in Chriſt,</hi> no difference: for the Female at firſt were made after the ſame Image that the Male were, <hi>He made them Male and Female in his own Image, Gen.</hi> 1.27. Both ſorts have the ſame Saviour, and are redeemed by the ſame price: A Woman ſaid, <hi>My ſoul rejoyceth in God my Saviour, Luke</hi> 1.47. they are both ſanctified by the ſame Spirit: the Apoſtle ſaith, that when an unbelieving Husband is knit to a believing Wife, <hi>The Husband</hi> 
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:47453:199"/>
                  <hi>is ſanctiſied by the wiſe,</hi> as well as in the other caſe, the Wife is ſanctified by the Husband.</p>
               <p>And this my brethren giveth a check, to the undue, the unjuſt conſure, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do give to this weaker veſſel, that this Sex is (as it were) the imperfection of nature, and I know not what; I will not ſtand upon it, as moſt unworthy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation.</p>
               <p>But for the Sex it ſelf, it is a particular conſolation againſt that matter of grieſe which it might conceive through <hi>Eves</hi> firſt ſin, not only in ſinning her ſelf, but in taking Satans part to tempt her Husband, whereupon followed ſubjection to the Man, and likewiſe pain in travel, and bringing forth of children. But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (ſaith the Apoſtle of that Sex) <hi>they ſhall be ſaved, if they continue in faith and charity,
<note place="margin">1 Tim 2.17.</note> and holineſs with ſobriety.</hi> So that, you ſee they have a right too.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, that God hath graciouſly dealt with them in making them the means of bringing forth the principal ground of this right of the one, and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is the Lord of life, the Saviour of the world, who was born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>Now this Sex is to comfort themſelves in this, that notwithſtanding there be ſome differences in outward condition, yet they are made partakers of the greateſt and beſt priviledge,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2 21.12.</note> alike joynt-<hi>heirs of the grace of God.</hi> I find but two things that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are exempted from that Sex, two priviledges, one to have juriſdiction over the Husband, another, publickly to teach in the Church of God: But yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mark a kind of recompence made for this: The former is but particular between Husband and Wife: but in lieu therefore a Woman may reign over many men, yea, over Nations,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 49.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Queens ſhall be thy nurſing mothers,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to the Church. And for the latter, to recompence that, they may be, and have been endued with the gift of propheſie: ſo that we ſee how God doth every manner of way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them.</p>
               <p>One word more concerning men, and ſo I will conclude this point. Namely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to them, anſwerably to reſpect the other Sex as thoſe that are Co-heirs with them, and therefore while they live, according to their places, according to their gifts, according to the bond of relation that is between them to reſpect them: and to ſhew the ſame when they are dead by a decent comely Funeral, and maintaining their credit, and giving of them their due praiſes.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Text.</p>
               <p>And now (my brethren) give me leave, I beſeech you, to ſtep a little further, and to ſpeak a word concerning this object before me. Howſoever I am not over-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at any time to ſpeak much on ſuch occaſions; yet at this time I ſuppoſe I ſhould do much wrong to the party in concealing thoſe things that are meet to be made known to the honour of that God who beſtowed thoſe excellent endowments upon her, and alſo injury to thoſe that knew her. I do not fear to be accounted a flatterer by any that hear me, and if any elſe ſhall imagine any ſuch thing, it may, it muſt needs be their envy, in that they cenſure what they know not. My fear is, leſt thoſe that did know her ſhould think that wrong is done to her by that little that ſhall be ſpoken, for enough cannot be ſpoken of her.</p>
               <p>You ſee here a black Herſe before you, a body in it deprived of life, and within theſe few dayes animated by a divine ſoul, now (as we have juſt cauſe to believe) glorified in heaven.</p>
               <p>The body of Miſtris <hi>I. R.</hi> in regard of Marriage, being the Daughter of Maſter <hi>I. B.</hi> a Gentleman in <hi>C.</hi> It ſeemed that as God endowed her with excellent parts every way, ſo ſhe had good education. She was married to Maſter <hi>I. R.</hi> a grave pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man, that lived in the fore-named place, who had been twice Major there, and long continued Alderman, ſtill relyed upon, when any matter of employment was to be performed, and therefore oft choſen to be a Burgeſs of the Parliament out of that Corporation. In the beginning of her marriage (ſhe attending to the Word as <hi>Lydia</hi> did) God was pleaſed to open her heart, and that ſpecially under the Miniſtry of a reverend Paſtour now ſome years with God, faithful, painful, powerful in his place while he lived, who yet liveth in the many works he publiſhed in his life-time. <pb n="384" facs="tcp:47453:200"/>I ſay by his Miniſtry being wrought upon, ſhe wonderfully improved the grace that was ſo wrought in her; and uſed all means for the growth thereof, by continual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying her ſelf to the publick miniſtry of the Word, conſcionably on the Lords day, frequently alſo on other dayes, both in that City, and in this alſo, whither ſhe came often times upon ſundry imployments, both while her Husband lived, and likewiſe ſince ſhe hath been a Widdow, which hath been about the ſpace of five years. Now I ſay as ſhe did thus help on the growth of grace by this publick means, ſo alſo by private diligently reading the Word, not contenting her ſelf with a courſory read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over by task (as ſome do) but ſhe had a Paper-book by her, and in reading would note down particular points, note ſpecially duties that belonged to ſuch, and ſuch perſons, to Magiſtrates, to Miniſters, to Husbands, to Wives, to Maſters, to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; General duties that belonged to Chriſtians, as they were Chriſtians; and that in ſuch a manner, as if ſo be they had been the Common places of ſome young Divine. And here (by the way) let me tell you what my ſelf have ſeen of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman of this City ſome while dead, who left behind him Volumes of books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his own hand: his manner was, firſt he would read, and after that he would walk up and down, and meditate upon what he read, and write down the ſum and particulars of it as he conceived, by which means he made himſelf excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently skilful as in Divine, ſo in humane learning. Thus did this grave Matron, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe came to much knowledge: ſhe gathered alſo many ſigns whereby ſhe had evidence of the truth of grace, and there yet remain divers ſuch heads noted by her with her own hand, ſigns of grace, ſigns of the truth of it, of the growth of it, of the effects of it, means to grow in grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An excellent courſe.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhe ſhewed piety in reading of the word of God: the like ſhe did in prayer, hearing others perform that duty in her Family, but ſpecially (when ſhe was both husband and wife, both maſter and miſtris, Death making a diviſion between her dear Husband and her ſelf) ſhe uſed to pray her ſelf; and thoſe that heard her, and have given teſtimony thereof admired her gifts that way.</p>
               <p>Frequent ſhe was (as apeared in her often retiring her ſelf to her Cloſet) in her conſtant and ſecret devotion; yea, alſo ſhe took occaſion of much faſting, ſpecially when ſhe heard of the troubles of the Church. The cauſe of the Church much affected her, either in matter of rejoycing, or griefe: ſhe continued it till her dying-day, and ſtill her heart was upon the peace of the Church, praying for it.</p>
               <p>As thus ſhe exerciſed her ſelf in this holy manner, ſo ſhe did likewiſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſpect thoſe that were the Miniſters of God: Amongſt many others, I have heard long ago that worthy Miniſter (before mentioned from whom I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved moſt of what I have now related) ſpeak much of her, and of her worthy Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in this reſpect: The feet of thoſe that brought the glad-tydings of ſalvation were beautiful to her.</p>
               <p>And as ſhe was careful to teſtifie her reſpect to them, ſo ſhe her ſelf gained no little recompence thereby, for ſhe was ſtill asking them queſtions, ſtill deſiring to have ſuch and ſuch doubts reſolved by them.</p>
               <p>As thus her piety was manifeſted, ſo likewiſe was her Charity, conſtantly every week giving relief to the Poor; ready upon all occaſions that ſhe was moved to, to open her hands, and to open them wide, and that again, and again, not wearied in doing good.</p>
               <p>Sober and grave ſhe was in her carriage and attire, and therein a good example to the younger ſort. And thus ſhe continued even to her dying day; full of ſweet meditations upon her death-bed, my ſelf partaked of ſome of them. Being asked what evidences ſhe had for her ſalvation? ſhe anſwered, good: whether ſhe doubted not? ſhe replyed no: though ſhe were of a tender conſcience, yet ſhe had laid ſuch a foundation, as her faith remained firm. She ſweetly ended her dayes with prayers of her own; with deſire of the prayers of Miniſters ſtill as they came to her; for as ſhe hearkned to, and deſired the benefit of their counſel when ſhe lived, ſo ſhe deſired the comfort of their prayers now in her death: thus I ſay with a ſound teſtimony of her faith, and of her good eſtate, ſhe ended her dayes <pb n="385" facs="tcp:47453:200"/>and we may be aſſured that ſhe is in the Number of thoſe that are Co-heirs of the grace of life.</p>
               <p>I remember the Philoſophers make mention of a word which contains in it a kind of collection or combination of all in one. I may ſay of her that the graces, and vertues, and ornaments of others ſeemed to be gathered together, and to meet in her: And ſo her piety toward God reſembleth her to the two pious <hi>Hanna's,</hi> the one the Mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the other the Daughter of <hi>Phanuel.</hi> Her charity reſembleth her to <hi>Dorcas,</hi> her love to the Miniſters of God, to the <hi>Shunamite</hi> that provided a Chamber, a Table, and a Candleſtick for <hi>Eliſha.</hi> In her relation to her Husband, ſhe ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf a true Daughter of <hi>Sarah.</hi> In her relation to her children which ſhe had, a <hi>Bathſheba</hi> and <hi>Eunice;</hi> To others a <hi>Priſcilla</hi> the Wife of <hi>Aquila,</hi> ready to inſtruct as occaſion was offered. And ſo my bretheren ſhe hath ſhewed her ſelf a follower of thoſe that through faith and patience inherit the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>It remaineth to us to ſet ſuch examples before us, and to be followers of them, as they have been followers of others, and as others have been followers of Chriſt, that ſo walking in their ſteps, we may alſo be in the number of ſuch as have the comfort of this Text, to be Co-heirs of the grace of life; which that you may do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The point that ariſeth from the firſt branch of the firſt general part, (<hi>viz.</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and longing of the Saints for their day of death) is this; that,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:47453:202"/>
                  <hi>The ſervants of God have in them a contented,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>comfortable, and willing expectation of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The riſe of this Obſervation is obvious enough: one ſpirit works in all Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and brings forth like effects, though not alwayes in the ſame meaſure, that therefore which is true in <hi>Simeon</hi> (which the very firſt view of the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) that the coming of Death was expected, and deſired by him, is in ſome degree verified ſooner or later in all that are the Lords.
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.13.</note> Hereunto agrees that of Saint <hi>Paul; I deſire</hi> (faith he) <hi>to be diſſolved, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>and to be preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The foundation of this deſire,
<note place="margin">The ground of the deſire of death in the Saints.</note> is the knowledg and right underſtanding of the truth of that ſpeech of <hi>Solomon,</hi> to wit, that <hi>the day of death is better, then the day of a mans birth.</hi> They have learned to know that the day of death to Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.1.</note> is the day of freedome from all miſeries, and of entrance into eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>The miſeries of this life which even the beſt are ſubject unto, are many, Loſs of goods, loſs of credit, loſs of friends, aches, pains, diſeaſes, ſevers, conſumptions, &amp;c. bondage under original corruption, and the fruits thereof, as unbelief, pride of heart, ignorance, covetouſneſs, diſtruſtfulneſs, hatred, luſt, &amp;c. the buffetings and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan, ſociety with the wicked: all theſe miſeries, even the Holieſt and deareſt ſervants of God are exerciſed with, and divers of theſe do make them many times mourn exceedingly,

                  <hi>and to have my habitation in the tents of Kedar:</hi> of all theſe miſeries Death is the end to Gods ſervants.</p>
               <p>And ſo alſo it is an entrance into happineſs: for albeit their bodies rot in the Grave, and be laid up in the Earth, as in Gods ſtore-houſe untill the laſt day, yet the ſoul forthwith even in an inſtant, comes into the preſence of the ever-living God, of Chriſt, and of all the Angels, and Saints in Heaven, <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi>

The knowledg of this benefit of Death, makes the face of it comfortable to Gods ſervants, and cauſes them to ſtrive with their own natural weakneſs, that ſo they may even long for their day of diſſolution.</p>
               <p>But now againſt this point divers Objections may be alledged.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Rom. 6, 23.</note> For firſt, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, that <hi>Death is the wages of ſin.</hi> And elſe-where he ſtiles it <hi>Chriſts enemy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.26.</note> 
                  <hi>the laſt enemy that he ſhall ſubdue is Death.</hi> How ſhould not death then be rather a day of miſery to be trembled at, then a day of happineſs to be longed for?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reſponſ.</hi> Death conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable two wayes.</note> that we are to diſtinguiſh touching Death, for it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered two wayes; Firſt, as it is in its owe nature: Secondly, as it is altred by Chriſt: in the firſt ſence it is true, that <hi>Death is the wages of ſin,</hi> and the very ſuburbs and the gates of hell. But in the ſecond taking of Death, it ceaſes to be a plague, and becomes a bleſſing, inaſmuch as it is even a door opening out of this world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven. Now the godly look not upon Death ſimply, but upon Death whoſe <hi>ſting</hi> and venome is plucked out by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo it is exceeding comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

                     <hi>Reſponſ.</hi> Why ſome of the Saints in the Scripture have prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt death.</note> firſt touching <hi>David,</hi> that when he compoſed that ſixt Pſalm, he was not only grievouſly ſick, but alſo exceedingly tormented in mind, for he wraſtled and combated in his conſcience with the wrath of God, as appears by the firſt Verſe of that Pſalm, therefore we muſt know, that he prayed not ſimply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Death, but againſt death at that time, in aſmuch as the coming of it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with extraordinary apprehenſions of Gods wrath; for at another time he tells us that he would <hi>not fear, though he walked through the valley of the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 23.4.</note> And the like I ſay touching <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that his prayer proceeded not from any deſperate fear of Death, but firſt that he might do more ſervice to God in his Kingdom. And with ſuch a kind of thought was Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> deſire of diſſolution mingled.
<note place="margin">Phil 1.23.24.</note> Secondly, he prayed againſt Death then, becauſe he knew that his death then would be a great cauſe of rejoycing to evil men, to whom his reformation in the State was unpleaſing. Thirdly, becauſe he wanted iſſue, God had promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings. 8, 25.</note> that <hi>there ſhould not fail a man of his ſeed to ſit upon the throne of Iſrael, ſo that his children did take heed to their wayes.</hi> Now, it was a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort to him to die chidleſs, for then he, and others might have thought, that he was but an Hypocrite, in as much as God had promiſed iſſue to all thoſe Kings that feared him, and for this cauſe God heard his prayer, and after two years gave him a ſon, <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> by name. And ſo I ſay the ſame touching our Saviour Chriſt, that he prayed not againſt Death, as it is the ſeparation betwixt Body and Soul; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what the Apoſtle faith,
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.5.</note> 
                  <hi>that he was heard, in that he feared,</hi> for he ſtood in our room, and <hi>became a Curſe for us,</hi> it was the Curſe of the Law which went with Death, and the unſpeakable wrath and indignation of God which he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and from this according to his prayer, he was delivered.</p>
               <p>But thirdly we ſee in moſt good men a fear of Death,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3.</note> and a deſire of life, and I my ſelf (may ſome godly man ſay) do feel my ſelf ready to tremble at the meditation thereof, and yet I hope I belong unto God.</p>
               <p>I anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reſponſ.</hi> Two things conſider able in a Chriſtian.</note> that there are two things to be conſidered in every Chriſtian, Fleſh, and Spirit; Corruption, and Grace; and the beſt have many inward perplexities at times, and doubtings of Gods favour: Now it is a truth which our Saviour delivers, that, <hi>the ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak.</hi> And as in all other good purpoſes there is a combate betwixt the fleſh,
<note place="margin">Mar. 26.41.</note> and the ſpirit; ſo is there in this, betwixt the fear of Death, and the deſire of Death; ſometime the one prevails, and ſometimes the other, but yet alwayes at laſt the deſire of Death doth get the victory. Carnal reſpects do often prevail far with the beſt, care of wiſe, children, and the like. Theſe are their infirmities, but as other infirmities die in them by degrees, ſo theſe alſo at laſt are ſubdued, and the ſervants of God ſeeing clearly the happineſs into which their Death in Chriſt ſhall enter them,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.2.</note> 
                  <hi>do even ſigh, deſiring to be clothed upon with their houſe which is from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then is a good Mark by which we may know our ſelves to be Gods ſervants,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> For Trial.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> by the ſtate of our thoughts and meditations touching Death. I will ſo deliver it, as may be moſt for the comfort of thoſe that truly fear God. I demand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of thee: Doſt thou know that the confident and comfortable expectation of Death is the work of the Holy Ghoſt in Gods ſervants? Doſt thou deſire unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the ſame may be wrought in thy heart? Doſt thou labour to know what happineſs comes by Death to thoſe that feare the Lord? Doſt thou grieve at thine own weakneſs, to whom the thought of Death is ſometime troubleſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory? Doſt thou pray the Lord ſo to aſſure thee of his favour in Chriſt, that death may be deſired before it comes, and welcome when it is come? Doſt thou when thou heareſt this ſpeech of <hi>Simeon,</hi> wiſh that thou wert able to uſe the like words, with the like reſolution? Surely, theſe things ſhew that thou art Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and that by Death the Lord will draw thee to a place of reſt.</p>
               <p>If theſe thoughts which I have now named be ſtrangers to thy heart, and thou doſt not love to trouble thy ſelf to ſtudy about Death, it is an evil ſign. The ſervants of God are not wont to be ſo ſecure in matters of this quality.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the firſt particular, in the firſt general part. the deſire in the godly of death: the ſecond is their care for it: the point thence is, that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:47453:203"/>It is the care of Gods ſervants to be alwayes ſo prepared for death,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct</hi> 2. A ſpecial care in the ſervants of God to be alwayes ready for death.</note> as at what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſoever the Lord ſhall ſend it, they may be comfortably ready to entertain it.</p>
               <p>So much may eaſily be gathered out of <hi>Simeons</hi> words here (<hi>Nunc dimittis.</hi>) <hi>Now let thy ſervant depart.</hi> He did not (as it were) take a day over, in which, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which to be provided, as though he ſhould have ſaid, Lord, now will I ſettle my ſelf to make proviſion for my laſt end, but even now, Lord, at this very inſtant, if thou wilt; Death hath been my ordinary meditation, and if thou wilt now call me home to thee, I am ready to depart.</p>
               <p>As in the former point I ſhewed you how Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> longing agreed with <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meons, Oh let thy ſervant depart,</hi> faith <hi>Simeon; I deſire to be diſſolved</hi> (faith <hi>Paul.</hi>) So here I will ſhew you, that there was the ſame care in reſpect of Death, in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim 4.6.</note> as in <hi>Simeon. Now,</hi> if thou wilt; (faith <hi>Simeon;</hi>) <hi>I am now ready to be offered</hi> (faith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>)
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.31.</note> And elſe-where, <hi>I did daily.</hi> I am ever thinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death, and daily making proviſion for my end. This was holy <hi>Jobs</hi> mind; <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time will I wait till my change come;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job. 14.14.</note> there was a continual expectation. <hi>So teach us to number our dayes,</hi> prayeth <hi>Moſes, that we way apply our hearts to wiſdome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 90.12.</note> And what wiſdome did he wiſh, he might apply his heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? but this, a holy care to make proviſion for another world, ſeeing in this there was no continuance? The ſame in effect, the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> profeſſeth touching himſelf, and thoſe that were like to him; that <hi>they had here no continuing City,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.14.</note> 
                  <hi>but did ſeek one to come.</hi> We know (faith he) here is no abiding, we dwell in tents which muſt remove, in <hi>houſes of clay,</hi> which will be broken, therefore we deſire to be ever ready for that place, which is of more perpetuity: And ſo much may be gathered from that which is upon record concerning <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathca,</hi> he did not only make ready his Tomb in his life-time, but in his garden, his place of ſolace and delight: and how could ſo good a man, ſo often think on death, without labouring and caring to be ever provided for the ſame;
<note place="margin">Luk. 12.36.</note> and therefore our Saviour Chriſt compares his faithful ſervants unto thoſe which daily <hi>wait for their Maſters coming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reaſon which ſo much prevails with the godly in this particular,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> and which ought to be of ſufficient force with every one; is firſt, the certainty, and uncertainy of death.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.48.</note> 
                  <hi>Morte nihil certius, As ſure as Death,</hi> is an ordinary Proverb; <hi>What man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death?</hi> (faith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt.) That all muſt die, it is Heavens decree, and cannot be revoked. The thing it ſelf, we ſee is moſt certain: yet for ſome circumſtances moſt uncertain: for firſt</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tempus eſt incertum,</hi> No man knows when he ſhall die, in the night, or in the day; in Winter, or in Summer; in youth, or in his latter age.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Locus eſt incertus,</hi> None know where they ſhall die, whether at home, or abroad; in his bed, or in the field; who knows but that he may die in the Church of God, even while he is aſleep at the Word?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Mortis genuseſt incertum:</hi> No man can determine how he ſhall die, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuddenly, or by a lingring ſickneſs; whether violently, or by a natural courſe. Theſe things the ſervants of God know full well, and ſeriouſly weigh the ſame, and that makes them to make conſcience of continual preparation, that whenſoever, or whereſoever, or howſoever they die, they may with comfort <hi>commend their ſouls into the hands of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.19.</note> 
                  <hi>as into the hand of a faithful Creatour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> they know the miſery of being taken by Death unprepared: put caſe a man ſhould die as <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 4.5.6.</note> lying upon his bed at noon; or as <hi>Jobs</hi> children, while they are ſeaſting;
<note place="margin">Job 1 19.</note> or that a man like the rich man in the Goſpel, ſhould have his breath taken from him at the very inſtant, having made no proviſion for another world, what hope can there be that ſuch a one ſhould be ſaved?</p>
               <p>They know thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.</note> that the time of ſickneſs is the moſt unfit time for this buſineſs of preparation: the ſenſes are then ſo taken up with the pain of ſickneſs, that a man <pb n="391" facs="tcp:47453:203"/>cannot think ſeriouſly upon ought elſe; and beſides, it is not in our own power to turn to God when he will: ordinarily God forgets thoſe in ſickneſs, that forget him in health:
<note place="margin">Note.</note> And it is commonly ſeen, that that preparation for Death that begins but in ſickneſs, is as languiſhing and faint, as is the party from whom it comes; And although <hi>Vera poenitentia</hi> be <hi>nunquam ſera,</hi> yet <hi>ſera poenitentia eſt raro vera.</hi> Though I ſay, true repentance be never too late, yet late repentance is ſeldome true; when men leave their ſins, becauſe they can continue to practiſe them no longer, what thanks have they, or what can that repentance be? Theſe things work with Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to ſtudy to be ever ready for the Lord, not to delay preparation, but to ſeek continually to be provided.</p>
               <p>My exhortation hence ſhall begin with that ſpeech of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Oh that men would be wiſe to underſtand this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut, 32.29.</note> 
                  <hi>and that they would conſider their latter end.</hi> I would there were a heart in us to entertain this doctrine in our beſt thoughts. I remember the Complaint of old, that men had <hi>made a Covenant with Death, and were at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with Hell.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 28.15.</note> Death indeed will make truce with no man; but here is the meaning, Evil men perſwade themſelves, that they are in no danger of hell, or of the grave. Death will not come yet thinketh the oldeſt man: and when it comes, I hope I ſhall do well enough, thinketh the moſt godleſs man. Thus men couzen themſelves with their own fancies, and ſo Death ſteals upon them at unawares, and becomes Gods Sergeant to arreſt them, and to carry them away to eternal condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Who amongſt us is able to ſay truly, and upon good ground, as <hi>Simeon, Now Lord,</hi> if thou wilt now command Death to ſeize upon me, welcome ſhall it be unto me, I am even now ready to receive it? How many are there that are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ignorant in the means how to eſcape <hi>the ſting of Death?</hi> How many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſecure, that never in their lives, yet thought earneſtly upon this, how they may die with comfort, and end their dayes in peace? How many prophane ones, that ſet light by Death, being apt to ſay like thoſe Epicures, <hi>Edamus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die?</hi> How many that do put all to a deſperate adventure, God made us, and he muſt ſave us, and we ſhall do as well as pleaſe God, and there is an end?</p>
               <p>How many are there, whoſe hearts, albeit they be in the houſe of God, and in his preſence, are notwithſtanding fraughted with malice, with envy, with worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with diſdain, with ſecret ſcorning, repining at the Word which they hear with weariſomeneſs, with ſpiritual ſleepineſs and ſecurity? You that are ſuch as I have now ſaid, think in your conſciences, what, would you die? if God ſhould now ſtop your breath, and aſcite you by Death preſently, to appear before his Majeſty, being thus full of ignorance, of ſecurity, of preſumption, of unſanctified, of vicious, of malicious, of covetous thoughts, could you find in your hearts to ſay, <hi>Lord, now let us depart?</hi> Sure we could not: but Death muſt needs be to us, as it is ſaid to be to the wicked,
<note place="margin">Job 28.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Rex terrorum, the King of terrours;</hi> if it ſhould come upon us, and find us in this caſe; And yet what know we how ſoon, how ſuddenly we may be overtaken? ſome of us drop away daily, ſome young, ſome old, ſome lie ſick longer, ſome leſſer time; and how ſoon it will be our turn we cannot tell; <hi>Our hreath is in our noſtrills, we are all as graſs;</hi> If the breath of the Lord blow upon us, we do ſuddenly wither, <hi>as the ſlower of the field,</hi> and return again to our firſt Earth. Why will we not labour to be now ready, ſith it may be alwayes truly ſaid, We may now depart, either while we are here, or in our way home, or in our beds, or at our meat? Who can truly ſay to himſelf; I am ſure, I ſhall not die this hour?</p>
               <p>It may be now thou wilt demand of me, What ſhall I do, that I may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?</p>
               <p>To inſiſt upon particulars,
<note place="margin">How to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for death.</note> would be too long, onely therefore in a word; <hi>The beſt preparation for death, is a reformed life.</hi> He that lives religiouſly, cannot but die preparedly: And it is a thouſand to one, if a wicked liver make a gracious end. The Scripture makes mention of a double Death, and ſo likewiſe of a twofold Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: the <hi>firſt Death,</hi> is the death of the body, which is the ſeparation of it from the ſoul. The <hi>ſecond death,</hi> is of the ſoul, which is the ſeparation of it from God. <pb n="392" facs="tcp:47453:204"/>
The <hi>firſt Reſurrection,</hi> is the riſing from the Death of ſin to a new life: the ſecond is that which ſhall be of the body out of the Grave, at the day of Judgment. Now what faith the Scripture; <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he, that hath part in the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, on ſuch the ſecond Death hath no power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wouldeſt thou then be freed from <hi>the ſecond Death,</hi> hell, &amp; deſtruction, when thou art dead?
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.6.</note> Now that thou art yet alive labour to have a part <hi>in the firſt Reſurrection:</hi> Note what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> faith of <hi>the wanton widdow,</hi> that <hi>ſhe is dead whilſt ſhe lives.</hi> So he that lives in the pleaſures of ſin, and in the wayes of his own heart, and after his own luſt, he is dead in ſoul, though he be alive in body, and if he ſeek not to come out of this grave, eternal death ſhall be his portion.</p>
               <p>Well then, wouldeſt thou prepare for Death? wouldeſt thou be able alwayes to ſay, <hi>Lord, now,</hi> now I am ready, labour to know God out of his Word (<hi>that is eternal life;</hi>)
<note place="margin">Jo. 17.13.</note> Labour to feel Chriſt live and raign in thee by his Spirit, labour to renounce every ſin, do not go on in any known ſin againſt conſcience, renew thy repentance daily, and ſtill ſurvey the ſtate of thy ſoul, <hi>that wickedneſs may not get dominion over thee.</hi> Let Death come when it will, though the Lord ſhould ſo viſit thee, that thou ſhouldeſt drop down ſuddenly, yet it ſhall not find thee unprepared, thou haſt <hi>a part in the firſt Reſurrection,</hi> there is no fear of <hi>the ſecond Death:</hi> But if thou wilt che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh thy heart in evil, thou wilt go on in thy ignorance, in thy careleſs worſhip of God; in thy prophaning the Sabbath, in thy whoredom, oppreſſion, malice, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, exceſs, voluptuouſneſs, thou makeſt ready for hell, and it is not thy, <hi>Lord ſave me,</hi> or, <hi>I cry God mercy,</hi> &amp;c. that ſhall ſerve thy turn. I will tell thee who thou art like unto, even to a man appointed after a year or two, to be burned, and in the mean ſpace muſt carry a ſtick daily to the heap, ſo thou heapeſt up wrath againſt thy ſelf, and makeſt thy ſcore ſo great, that when Death comes, thou ſhalt not know how to be prepared. And thus have I finiſhed the firſt general part of my Text, touching the diſpoſition of the godly in reſpect of Death.</p>
               <p>I proceed now in a word to the ſecond, the ground, rule, or warrant of this deſire, and preparation for death, (<hi>according to the word</hi>) as if <hi>Simeon</hi> had ſaid, this deſire that I have now to end my dayes, proceeds not from any carnal diſcontentment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am now old, and can take no great comfort in worldly things, but the ground of it is, thy word and Promiſe; thou, Lord, haſt <hi>revealed</hi> unto thy ſervant, <hi>that I ſhould not die before I had ſeen my Saviour;</hi> This word is now fulfilled, and the ſweetneſs thereof hath given me that encouragement, that I do even long <hi>to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> and to be united unto thee. Or again thus, Oh Lord, this care that I have had to provide thus for Death, and to be alwayes in a readineſs, it hath not come from my ſelf, nature never taught it me, but <hi>thy Word hath inſtructed me;</hi> If I had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>according to thy Word,</hi> I ſhould never have known how to have prepared my ſelf to the time of diſſolution. This is the meaning of the words, and ſo the Doctrine is plain; (<hi>viz.</hi>) that,<lb/>
                  <hi>Men ignorant in Gods word can never take comfort in death,
 nor be truly prepared to undergo it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Ignorant men can neither take comfort in, nor be truly prepared for death.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is plain, if we conſider the Expoſition which I have already given of that part of <hi>Simeons</hi> ſpeech. It is a general Rule, that of our Saviour, <hi>Ye err not knowing the Scripture.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math 22.29.</note> A man ignorant in the Scripture, can never rightly perform any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual duty. Hence was that of <hi>David, Thy teſtimonies</hi> (faith he) <hi>are my delight, and my counſellors.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal 119 24</note> If any matter came in hand that concerned his ſoul, ſtraight to the word of God went he, to know thence how to do it; as a man for his Leaſe, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance goeth to a Counſellor for direction: So again he confeſſes, that <hi>if Gods Law had not been his delight,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal 119, 9 93</note> 
                  <hi>he ſhould have periſhed in his afflictions.</hi> And ſo, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, no true quiet in any trouble, much more at Death, without the guidance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Word. The aſſurance that <hi>the ſting of Death</hi> is plucked out, that Gods wrath is appeaſed, that ſin is pardoned, that Heaven gate is opened; whence ſhall we fetch theſe, but from the Scripture? the directions for a holy life, which is the beſt preparation for Death; where ſhall we find them, but in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:47453:204"/>Here then we ſee is a Caveat to all that have no will,

To be a Scripture-man is a by-word, a reproach, a matter of diſgrace; and ſooner will men liſten to ſome idle Pamphlet, then to a matter of Scripture. Well, beguile not your ſouls, with theſe vain conceits, with your Popiſh and carnal imaginations. I ſay, and teſtifie from this place, that that man or woman, which careth not to be taught out of Gods book, cannot die like a Chriſtian: Who can teach thee the way to die well, but God? And where doth God teach, but in the Scripture? If our thoughts of Death, if our proviſion, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Death be not warranted, and guided by Gods word, it is all in vain. Lord, faith <hi>Simeon,</hi> my deſire of diſſolution is <hi>according to thy Word;</hi> my care to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, hath been ordered by thy Word; he cannot die with comfort, that cannot make the like profeſſion. And this may ſerve for the next general part, the ground of this deſire, and preparation for Death, it is Gods word; <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart according to thy Word.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is evident out of the force of the phraſe here uſed: <hi>Simeon</hi> knew that ſo long as he lived, his ſoul was (as it were) impriſoned in his body, and in it he was held in bondage under the remnants of Original corruption, ſubject to the aſſaults and temptation of Satan, in continual and daily poſſibility to treſpaſs and ſin againſt Cod, beſide other afflictions and grievances in the body and eſtate: but he had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al this knowledge and underſtanding of the nature of Death, that it was an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſoul, and a freeing of it utterly and finally from all thoſe, and the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances.</p>

<note place="margin">Rev. 14.13.</note> namely, that the death of the Righteous, is to them a diſcharge from all miſery, the Scripture bears witneſs to it: <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>are the dead, which die in the Lord, even ſo faith the ſpirit, that they may reſt from their labours.</hi> As long as they live here, they are diverſly troubled, when they die their labours are at an end, and they are received into reſt, Saint <hi>John</hi> tels us, that in his viſion he ſaw, <hi>the ſouls of them that were ſlain,</hi>

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi>
                  </note> how ſhall I know that the day of Death, is the day of diſſolution, and this kind of diſmiſſion?</p>
               <p>A very neceſſary <hi>quaere</hi> indeed this is:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> for every man almoſt is ready to challenge to himſelf a part of this happineſs,
<note place="margin">How to know whether the day of death be a diſcharge from all former, and following miſerles.</note> and it is a matter preſumed upon by many, which ſhall never enjoy it. I will therefore give you one certain mark, by which we may know aſſuredly, that the day of our death ſhall be to us, a day of enlargment, and of final diſcharge from all, both former and following miſeries, and that is this; if in the time of our life here, our being ſubject to corruption, and ſin, hath ſeemed unto us the greateſt burden, and bondage. They which have groaned and mourned under their own natural corruptions, as it were under ſome heavy and tyrannous yoak, or as the Iſraelites mourned under their <hi>Egyptian Task-maſters,</hi> to them only ſhall the day of death, be a day of freedome. If ſin be not a burden to thee; if thou doſt not many times lament, and even mourn to think how thou art carried captive unto evil; if thou doſt not with grieſe feel how thou art clogged with corruption, and hindred by it from doing the good which thou ſhouldeſt, certainly death will be to thee the biginning of thy thraldome, and after it thou ſhalt be a perpetual bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave unto Satan in the kingdome of etetnal darkneſs. Mark this all ye that take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in evil, to whom it is <hi>a paſtime to do wickedly,</hi> and who ſeek rather how to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, then how to ſuppreſs your own corruptions, who repute it a kind of happineſs to follow the ſwing of your own luſts, and to have liberty to do as your own hearts do lead you; when you die, this ſhall be your reward, even a moſt miſerable and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs captivity under Satan, him have you ſerved in the luſts of ſin while ye lived, his ſlaves ſhall you be without hope of releaſement, world without end. This is the right Application of this Doctrine, death is a day of enlargement to the godly, it is a diſmiſſion.</p>
               <p>The next particular is, that it is a diſmiſſion accompanied with peace, the leſſon we are taught hence is; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>The ſervants of God have at their going out of the word, a comfortable, quiet, and peaceable departure.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. The Saints at their going hence have a comfortable and peaceable debarture.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Simeon</hi> here, he prayed for no other thing, but that his end might be as the end of the Righteous is ever wont to be, even a departure hence in peace. Hence is that general rule of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright man, for the end of that man is peace.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.37</note> Agreeable whereunto is that of <hi>Solomon;</hi> that, <hi>the righteous hath hope in his death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov, 14.32.</note> And memorable to this purpoſe is that which is ſtoried of old father <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſhewing unto us the quiet end of the Righteous, <hi>He ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up his feet into the bed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49.33. Gen. 13.25.2 King. 22.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſo gave up the Ghoſt.</hi> It was the bleſſing promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>go to his fathers in peace.</hi> And the ſame was made to good <hi>Joſias.</hi> There is a twofold reaſon hereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:47453:205"/>Firſt, the aſſurance which they have of the favour of God in Chriſt. This muſt needs breed quietneſs, when I am perſwaded in my ſoul and conſcience, that all cauſe of danger after death is removed, and that God is, and will be, gracious unto me in his Son. What cauſe of fear is here leſt, what occaſion of perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
               <p>If any man ſhall doubt whether the ſervants of God have this aſſurance;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> I prove it thus, that all of them firſt or laſt, have it in ſome good meaſure. <hi>If any man</hi> (faith the Apoſtle) <hi>have not the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8:9.</note> 
                  <hi>he is none of his.</hi> Hence it neceſſarily followes, that all that are Chriſts, have the Spirit of Chriſt, but now <hi>the office of the Spirit is to bear witneſs with our ſpirit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap: 16.</note> So that all that are the Lords, as they are endued with Gods Spirit, ſo they feel this Spirit bearing witneſs to their ſouls of this Adoption.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> the comfortable Teſtimony of their own conſciences touching their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer care to gloriſie God by a Religious and godly converſation: Hence came Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> peace, <hi>I have,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>fought the good fight, I have kept the faith,</hi> Therefore I am ſure <hi>there is laid up for me a Crown of life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim: 4.7, 8. Iſa: 38: 3.</note> Hence <hi>Hezekiahs, I have walked before thee, oh Lord, in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi> Not that they do ground their hope upon the deſert of their fore-ran courſes, but becauſe they know good works to be the way,
<note place="margin">Ephſ; 22 10.</note> and do underſtand by the Scripture, that a holy life here, is the firſt fruits of a glorified life hereafter. Thus we ſee the truth of this point, and the reaſons upon which it is grounded.</p>
               <p>Now here ſome may object;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</note> firſt, We ſee many worthy men, that have made a great, and an extrordinary profeſſion of Religion in their lives, and which have alſo carried themſelves unblamable, yet to give appearance of much anguiſh and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and even of a kind of deſpair in their death. How can we ſay then, that all good and holy perſons have a peaceable departure?</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reſponſ.</hi> Joh. 7.24. The unqulet departure of many of the Saints cleared, with the grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> We ought to remember the Rule our Saviour gives, <hi>not to judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the outward appearance.</hi> It is a very weak argument to ſay, that this, or that man dyeth without peace, becauſe to the ſtanders by he makes not ſhew of peace. Certaine it is, that as a man may have peace with God, and yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a time, by reaſon of ſome tentation not feel it; ſo a man being ſick, or going out of the world may feel it, and yet others that behold him cannot perceive it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt know that theſe outward unquietneſſes, which do many times accompany ſickneſs, do happen as well, and as ordinarily to good men, as to the moſt wicked, ſuch as are ravings, and idle-talkings, and ſtrange accidents in the body; in this ſence <hi>all things come alike to all.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſs.</hi> 9.2.</note> God hath made no promiſe in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that thoſe that ſerve him ſhall be freed in their deaths from violent ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Therefore theſe things muſt not be thought to be any abridgment of their peace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt conſider, that with the beſt ſervants of God, Satan is moſt buſie, when his end is neereſt, and when he is (as it were) out of all hope of prevailing. The <hi>red Dragon</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 12.12.</note> 
                  <hi>had greateſt wrath when he knew his time to be ſhort.</hi> When the evil Spirit was commanded once to come out of the child,
<note place="margin">Mark. 9.26.</note> then <hi>it rent him ſore.</hi> Now theſe temptations, though for the time they be very violent and extream; ſo that the party may (happily) utter out ſome words, and ſpeeches of diſpair, yet be they no final prejudice to the inward peace. Interrupt they may, but utterly quench it they cannot, becauſe the <hi>power of God is made perfect through weakneſs.</hi> And ſo even in death, Satan receives the greateſt foil, when he thinks to get the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt victory.</p>
               <p>Thus then I anſwer in one word; The peace of Gods ſervants at death is not ever in the like meaſure felt by them, but yet it never dieth in them: they which behold their death do not alwayes ſee it, yet they themſelves, ſooner or later are ſure ſweetly and ſecretly to feel the ſame.</p>
               <p>My reaſon for my aſſertion is grounded, firſt upon that of the Apoſtle; <hi>God commands light to ſhine out of darkneſs:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4 6.</note> He brings his ſervants to Heaven by the gates of hell, out of ſorrow and anguiſh, and tentation, he raiſeth out their greateſt quiet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:47453:206"/>Secondly, becauſe the love of God is eternal and unchangeable. <hi>Whom he loves, he loves to the end.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſa: 54.8 John 13.1. <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</note> It is impoſſible that the Lord, albeit he try, and that ſharply, yer ſhould finally for ſake thoſe that are his in their greateſt extremity.</p>
               <p>But again ſecondly, if you make a peaceable death to be the reward of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, what ſay you to this? There be many that in all their life gave little evidence of any Religion, or grace, but of the contrary rather, yet in their death were very quiet and ſtill, and ſeemed to all that were by, to have in them no manner of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no troubleſome thoughts, no perplexed motions; ſhall we ſay that theſe were good men, becauſe they ſeem to go away in peace.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reſponſ.</hi> The ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet departure of the wicked, with the grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> it is the common opinion, Doth a man lye quietly? hath he his memory to the end? died he like a Lamb? ſurely then he is gone to heaven: but this is an abſurd collection; for,</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſometime this outward calmneſs is an ordinary conſequent of ſome diſeaſes, as Conſumptions, and ſuch like, by which Nature being formerly weakned, hath not power left to make reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this outward calmneſs is no argument of a peaceable and quiet ſoul. The Pſalmiſt tells us of <hi>the wicked in whoſe death there are no bands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Pſal 73.4:</note> we muſt diſtinguiſh between ſecurity and peace, betwixt carnal ſenſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and true ſpiritual quietneſs. <hi>Nabals</hi> death was quiet enough, yet he were but a <hi>fool</hi> that would adventure his ſoul with <hi>Nabals.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.37.</note> I ſee many ignorant perſons, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of heatheniſh, and brutiſh comverſation, very quiet in ſickneſs, without any fear of hell, and judgment to come, making no doubts, caſting no perils, asking no queſtions, complaining of no ſins, and ſo away they go without any more adoe. What, ſhall I ſay that theſe died in true peace? God forbid. No, when I compare together their ignorant, ſecure, benummed, hardned kind of life, with their ſenſleſs and drowſie kind of death, I muſt ſay, that theſe are fearful ſigns, theſe things argue that the Devil had quiet poſſeſſion,
<note place="margin">Luk. 11.11,</note> where he made ſo ſmall a doe. Thus then not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe Objections I will conclude, that a peaceful death, is the peculiar and individed priviledge of Gods ſervants.
<note place="margin">Excleſ. 8.12. Eſay 57.11.</note> However it be, yet I know (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) that <hi>it ſhall go well with thoſe that fear the Lord, but there is no peace to the wicked ſaith my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may make Uſe of this firſt to be a trial betwixt our Religion and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>

                        </gap>y.</hi>
                  </note> for from this Doctrine I avouch that Religion to be no true Religion: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Papiſt by the Rules of his own Religion can never die <hi>in peace:</hi> This is a hard ſaying, thou maiſt object, or how can I make it good? I anſwer by two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, every Papiſt is taught to beleeve under pain of <hi>Anathema,</hi> and <hi>the great curſe,</hi> that whoſoever dieth, if he have not in this life attained to perfection, and throughly purged himſelf from the remainders of ſin by works of ſatisfaction, his ſoul muſt after-death go into <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and there continue untill he hath made a full ſatisfaction: now the pain of <hi>Purgatory</hi> is held for the time to be as great as the pains of hell, differing only in this, that it is not perpetual: Now I would fain know, how can a man die comfortably and in peace, and with a joyful heart, when he thinks with himſelf, that albeit (perhaps) after ſome years he ſhall go to heaven, yet in the mean ſpace his ſoul muſt go into ſuch a place of unſpeakable torment, where if the matter be not well plyed by the prayers of them that are alive, and by well ſeeing the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> they may hap to lie for many years? I ſay, how can the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Popery beget a peaceful death, when it teacheth an expectation of ſuch an helliſh <hi>Purgatory,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, every Papiſt as he is bound of a certain to beleeve a <hi>Purgatory,</hi> ſo further muſt he beleeve, that he cannot in this life be aſſured of ſalvation, otherwiſe then by a kind of confuſed hope, which may deceive him. Now he which by the witneſs of his own conſcience is ſure that he hath deſerved hell, and cannot attain to any certainty of diſcharge, what comfort can ſuch an one have to die? he knows that when he is dead, he muſt come to his account before God, but yet can have no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the Lord will acquit him in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I wiſh that this may ſeriouſly be conſidered by us, for the eſtabliſhing of us in the <pb n="397" facs="tcp:47453:206"/>truth of Religion: I ſay again and teſtifie, theſe reaſons which I have alledged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weighed, that a <hi>Rapiſt</hi> by his own doctrine can never expect that which <hi>Simeon</hi> did, <hi>a departure</hi> hence <hi>in peace:</hi> He knows he muſt to torment, he is caught that he cannot know in this world that God will pardon him.</p>

               <p>I will tell thee in few words, (I touched it a little before) the beſt means for a peaceable departure, is a godly and religious life: <hi>I have fought the good fight,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and he could comfortably from thence infer, that therefore <hi>there was laid up, for him a crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> It was Chriſts own inference, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon of it is firſt Gods promiſe:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.1.1 Sam. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>bleſſed ſhall be the undefiled in the way: Thoſe that honour me, I will honour,</hi> ſaid God. Now this promiſe God will not break. He that goeth this way, though it be with much weakneſs, with many falls, with ſundry imperfections, with divers wandrings, yet he cannot miſs of the promiſed <hi>peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, life eternal hath three degrees, the firſt is in this life, when a man repenteth, and beleeveth, and is <hi>purged from dead works, to ſerve the living God;</hi> The ſecond is in death, when the body goes to earth, and the <hi>ſpirit returns to him that gave it.</hi> The third is at the laſt judgment: Theſe three degrees hang together like three links,
<note place="margin">Luk. 13.3.2 Theſ, 5.24.</note> the ſecond followeth the firſt, and the third the two former; the laſt cannot be hoped for, where the firſt is wanting: for <hi>except ye repent, ye ſhall all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> The firſt being obtained, the laſt muſt needs enſue: for <hi>he is faithful that hath promiſed.</hi> So then, wouldeſt thou have peace in death? labour for grace in thy life; wouldeſt thou end thy dayes happily? make conſcience to ſpend them holily. A godleſſe man that lives in ſin, may die ſenſleſly, or ſullenly, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die peaceably. Oh <hi>conſider this all ye that forget God,</hi> that ſpend your dayes in vanity, and your years according to the luſts of your own heart, that have hitherto hated to be reformed, and will not be reclaimed from your former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, but live yet ſtill, as you were wont to do. Think a little with me of your laſt end, which how neer it is you do not know; when your conſciences a little awaked, ſhall make report of your life paſt, how in matters of God you have been ignorant, ſuperſtitious, careleſs, neglecting his worſhip, deſpiſing his Word, blaſpheming his Name, miſpending his Sabbaths, in dealing with men you have been cruel, falſe, unmerciful, oppreſſing; in the uſage of your own bodies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt, vicious, luſtful, proud, wanton, wallowing in exceſs; what peace can your ſouls have, when theſe things be thought upon? what calmneſs of ſpirit? what hope of entring into reſt? how can you think that the end can be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, when the life hath been abominable. What anſwer made <hi>Jehu</hi> to <hi>Joram,</hi> when he demanded, <hi>Is it peace Jehu? What peace</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſo long as the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of thy mother Jezabel,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe Words that I have read to you, they are part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <hi>Martha,</hi> and Chriſt, when Chriſt was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Bethany</hi> to awake <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the ſleep of death. The conference is laid down from the beginning of the 21. Verſe, to the end of the 27. and <hi>Martha</hi> meeting with Chriſt, begins the conference, as we may ſee, verſe 21, 22. <hi>Then ſaid Martha to Jeſus, Lord if thou haddeſt been here my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had not died: but I know that even now whatſoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</hi> Here <hi>Martha</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts her affection to her dead brother, and her faith in her living Maſter: ſhe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts the ſtrength of her natural affection, and the weakneſs and imperfection of her faith. The ſtrength of her natural affection, appears in this, that ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded if Chriſt had been there preſent, her brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> had not died, he <pb n="400" facs="tcp:47453:208"/>would not have ſuffered <hi>Lazarus</hi> to have dyed: which for ought we know is more then ſhe had ſufficient ground for. Then the weakneſs and imperfection of her faith appears in this, that ſhe reſted too much upon the corporal preſence of Chriſt, that ſhe aſcribed no more power to Chriſt, then that by his prayer he could attain at Gods hands as much as ever any holy man did; namely, the life of her brother. I know, ſaith ſhe, that <hi>ever now whatſoever thou askeſt, God will give it;</hi> Whereas Chriſt being true God, was able to work any miracle by his own power.</p>
               <p>Now the anſwer of Chriſt is laid down verſe 23. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto her, thy brother ſhall riſe again.</hi> Chriſt, to comfort <hi>Martha,</hi> paſſeth by her infirmity, and promiſeth to her, that he will reſtore her brother to life again, that ſhe ſhall enjoy her brother again: but this promiſe is only laid down in general and indifinite termes; <hi>Thy brother ſhall riſe again.</hi> Chriſt doth not ſay expreſly, I will raiſe up thy brother to life, but he ſpeaks only in general terms, <hi>Thy brother ſhall riſe again:</hi> which we are to aſcribe to the modeſty, and humility, that alwayes may be obſerved in the ſpeeches of Chriſt; <hi>Thy brother ſhall riſe again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then we have the reply of <hi>Martha,</hi> laid down in verſe 24. <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>I know he ſhall riſe again in the Reſurrection, at the laſt day, Martha</hi> was not ſatisfied with this promiſe of Chriſt: for it ſeems ſhe durſt not take it in the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, therefore ſhe replies, that as for the laſt Reſurrection ſhe knew indeed, that her brother, and all others that were dead, ſhould then riſe again, this did comfort her: but for any other matter of comfort ſhe could not gather any from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of Chriſt, and his promiſe: therefore Chriſt replies again in the words of my Text, <hi>And Jefus ſaid unto her, I am the Reſurrection, and the life, he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live, and whoſoever liveth and believeth in me ſhall never die.</hi> Chriſt would have <hi>Martha</hi> know that he was true life, yea, the fountain of all life, and ſuch a fountain of life, that whoſoever did believe in him, and cleave to him, nothing ſhould hurt him, no not Death it ſelf. Thus you ſee briefly the coherence, and the ſcope of the words. We come now to ſhew you the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
               <p>In theſe words we may obſerve theſe two parts.
<note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, here we have laid down a compound propoſition.</p>
               <p>And then the diſtinct Expoſition, or explication thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, here we have laid down a compound Axiome, or Propoſition, a copulative Propoſition, wherein Chriſt affirms two things of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>I am the Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>I am the Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am the Reſurrection, I am the Life. Now the difference between theſe two, we may conceive with reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> to be this.<lb/>
                  <hi>I am the Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, I have all quickning power in me, I am able to reſtore, and give life to thoſe that are dead. And then <hi>I am the life;</hi> I have ſuch quickning power in me, that I am able to preſerve, and continue the life that I have given, or reſtored to any; <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then follows the Expoſition of this Propoſition, and of the ſeveral members of it: for the truth of a copulative Propoſition depends upon the truth of both the parts and members of it, therefore there followes the Explication, and confirmation of both the parts of this Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Firſt of the firſt part, <hi>I am the Reſurrection,</hi> this is explained, and comfirmed in theſe words; <hi>He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live.</hi> I have ſuch a quickning power in me, faith Chriſt, that I am able to reſtore ſpiritual life to that ſoul that is dead in ſins, therefore I am able to raiſe up the body that is dead in the grave; I am able to give ſpiritual life to the ſoul, which is greater, and the more difficult work; and if I be able to do the greater, I am able to do the leſs: he that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves ix me,</hi> faith Chriſt, though before he were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, <hi>yet he ſhall live,</hi> he ſhall live the life of grace.</p>
               <p>Then followes the Fxplication and confirmation of the ſecond member of the Propoſition in theſe words, <hi>Whoſoever liveth and believeth in me, ſhall never die.</hi> 
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:47453:208"/>I am the life faith Chriſt, for whoſoever believeth in me, and ſo is reſtord to ſpiritual life, he ſhall <hi>never die;</hi> he ſhall never die, to ſpeak properly, for he ſhall never periſh, he ſhall never die, this life ſhall never be taken from him, neither here nor hereafter; not here, for he ſhall continue to live the life of grace: not hereafter, for though the body ſhall die, yet this ſeparation of the body from the ſoul, it is not ſo properly a death, as a paſſage to life; a paſſage from the life of grace, to the life of glory. And this body alſo that is ſeparated from the ſoul, it ſhall be quickned again, and ſhall be raiſed up to live for ever; therefore <hi>he that believeth in me, ſhall never die.</hi> Thus you ſee the words expounded.</p>
               <p>Now from the firſt member of this Propoſition, <hi>I am the Reſurrection;</hi> and the Expoſition, and confirmation of it in theſe words, <hi>He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live.</hi> Hence the point of Doctrine I will obſerve is this; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Fountain,
 and Author of all life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt the Fountain and Author of all life.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He is able to give and reſtore life to thoſe that are dead; He is the Reſurrection. Now, whereas there is a double death, and a double Life, and conſequently a double Reſurrection; we muſt underſtand that Chriſt is the Author of both: in this place we are not to exclude either. Therefore we will endeavour to expound this general doctrine in theſe three particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt hath ſuch a quickning power in him, that he is able to raiſe up thoſe dead bodies of his, that now lie in the Grave.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath ſuch a quickning power in him, that he is able to raiſe up the ſoul that is dead in ſins, to a ſpiritual life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we will ſhew you why Chriſt, as in this place, ſo elſe-where, doth expreſs both the ſtate of the faithful here, and their eſtate after, under the ſame phraſe of ſpeech, he comprehends both under this term, <hi>I am the Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, Chriſt is the Author of life, he hath ſuch a quickning power in him, that he is able to raiſe up the dead bodies of his out of their graves. We will ſpeak firſt of this Reſurrection that is of the body, though it be later in time; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that naturally we are more apt to conceive of the death, and life of the body, then of the death and life of the ſoul. And ſecondly, becauſe that the underſtanding of this Reſurrection of the body, will give light to the underſtanding of the other, of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>And here firſt we will ſhew briefly what this Reſurrection of the body is.</p>
               <note place="margin">1 Of the body.</note>
               <p>And then prove that Chriſt is the Author, and the fountain of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt the Reſurrection of the body is this,
<note place="margin">Reſurrection of the body, what.</note> when the ſoul that was actually ſeparate from the dead body, returns again to its proper body, and being united to it, the man riſeth up out of the Grave, with an immortal, incorruptible body to lead a glorified life. This it the Reſurrection of the body.</p>
               <p>Now that Chriſt is the Author of this Reſurrection of the body it is evident: For as Chriſt himſelf by his own power, raiſed himſelf being dead in the Grave, <hi>John</hi> 2.19. faith Chriſt, <hi>deſtroy this Temple, and in three dayes I will raiſe it again,</hi> ſpeaking of the Temple of his body. And ſo again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>I have power,</hi> faith Chriſt, <hi>to lay down my life, and to take it up again:</hi> ſo likewiſe Chriſt by his quickning ſpirit he will raiſe up the bodies of thoſe that are now dead in the grave, as we may ſee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.28, 29. <hi>Marvel not at this,</hi> faith Chriſt, <hi>for the hour is coming in which all that are in the grave, ſhall hear the voice of the Son of man, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good to the reſurrection of life,</hi> &amp;c. In this regard Chriſt is called the <hi>firſt fruits of them that ſleep.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.20.</note> For as the firſt fruits being offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, did ſanctifie the whole crop; and the owner hereby was aſſured of the bleſſing of God upon all the reſt: ſo Chriſt is the firſt fruits of the dead, and his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection it is an aſſurance to the faithful of their Reſurrection, and the cauſe of it: both an aſſurance, a pledge of it, and likewiſe a cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>Therefore herein Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> is oppoſed to the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> who was the root of all man-kind did communicate death, and mortality <pb n="402" facs="tcp:47453:209"/>to all thoſe that ſpring from him: ſo likewiſe Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection he conveyes life, and a quickning power to all his members, as we may ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21.22. <hi>For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead: for as in Adam all die; Adam</hi> he communicates death and mortality to all that ſpring from him, <hi>even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> Chriſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes life to all his members, and they are all quickned by his Spirit; therefore Chriſt is called a quickning ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. <hi>The firſt Adam was made a living ſoul, but the laſt Adam a quickning ſpirit;</hi> not only a living, but a quickning ſpirit. And this quickning power and vertue, Chriſt did manifeſt before his reſurrection, by raiſing up three from death, namely, by raiſing the Widdows ſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. and <hi>Jairus</hi> his Daughter, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. and <hi>Luzarus</hi> here in this chapter. And at his reſurrection alſo he manifeſted this his quickning power, in that he roſe not alone, but raiſed the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of many of his Saints with him, many of his Saints aroſe with him, and as they roſe with Chriſt their head, ſo alſo they aſcended to glory together with Chriſt their head, and the reſurrection of theſe it was an effect of the reſurrection of Chriſt, it was by the power of Chriſts reſurrection. Of theſe we may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.52, 53. <hi>The graves opened, and many bodies of the Saints that ſlept aroſe,</hi> and came out of their graves after his reſurrection, and went into the holy City and appeared to many. Thus you have the firſt concluſion proved, that Chriſt is the Author of the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body.</p>
               <p>Now in the next place, the ſecond concluſion is this; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>Chriſt is the Author and Fountain of ſpiritual life alſo.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Of ſpiritual life.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He is the Author of the Reſurrection of the ſoul; and the reſurrection of the ſoul it is this, when the Spirit of grace, (of which we were all deprived in <hi>Adam</hi>) returns again to the ſoul of a natural man, and ſo quickens the man, that the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to riſe out of the grave of ſin, and to lead a new life, a ſpiritual life, the life of grace: this is the reſurrection of the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now that Chriſt is the Author of this Reſurrection alſo, of this ſpiritual Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: we may demonſtrate this by a multitude of Divine teſtimonies, but we will ſingle out ſome few of the chieſe, we need go no further then this Evangeliſt, which affords plentiful teſtimony for the confirmation of this truth: As in <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. There Chriſt ſpeaking to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> he ſaid unto her; <hi>If thou haddeſt known the gift of God, and who it is that ſaid unto thee give me drink, thou ſhouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> Here the Spirit of Chriſt it is compared to living water, by an alluſion to the water that continually ſpringeth out of a Fountain. And the Spirit of grace is compared to living water from the effects of it: becauſe the Spirit of grace reſtoreth ſpiritual life to the ſoul, and then preſerveth this life; therefore it is living Water, and Chriſt is as the Fountain of this water that yeeldeth, and giveth this living, quickning water of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Again in <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.21. there Chriſt challengeth this power to himſelf, <hi>As the Father raiſed up the dead, and quickneth them; ſo the Son quickneth whom he will.</hi> As Chriſt when he was upon the earth, he raiſed whom he would from the death of the body, ſo now being in heaven, he raiſeth whom he will from the death of the ſoul. Yea, the voyce of Chriſt ſounding in the miniſtry of the Word, accompanied with his quickning Spirit, is of power and efficacie to raiſe thoſe that are dead in ſins, as we may ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> faith Chriſt, <hi>the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voyce of the Son of God, and they that hear it ſhall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. there Chriſt ſtileth himſelf the Bread of life, and the Living bread; <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life;</hi> and in verſe 48. <hi>I am the bread of life;</hi> and again verſe 51. <hi>I am the living bread.</hi> Chriſt is the living bread, the bread of life, who as he hath life in himſelf, ſo he communicates ſpiritual life to all thoſe that ſeed upon him. And here is a broad difference between this Bread of life, and ordinary bread, ordinary food: for though ordinary food can preſerve natural <pb n="403" facs="tcp:47453:209"/>life where it is, yet it cannot reſtore life where it is not; but Chriſt is ſuch living Bread, that he reſtores life to thoſe that are dead in ſins, and preſerves that life that he hath reſtored, thus he is the living Bread.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1. there Chriſt compares himſelf to a Vine, and the faithful to ſo many branches; <hi>I am the true Vine,</hi> faith Chriſt, <hi>and my Father is the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> And in verſe 5. <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the branches.</hi> Now as the branch of the Vine ſucks juyce and ſap from the ſtock and root of the Vine; ſo all the faithful receive ſpiritual juyce and life, from Chriſt their head. As <hi>Adam</hi> he is a common root of corruption, and ſpiritual death to all that come from him; ſo Chriſt is a common root of grace, and ſpiritual life to all thoſe that are his members. And in this regard Chriſt is compared to a head, and the faithful to his members. <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Chriſt is the head of his body the Church.</hi> Chriſt is the head; and the faithful are his members: therefore as in the natural body, the head that is the <hi>principium,</hi> the fountain of ſence and motion: it is the head that by certain nerves and ſinews conveyes ſence and motion to all the members of the body: ſo in the myſtical body the Church, Chriſt is the head that conveyes ſpiritual life and motion, to all that are his members, to all the faithful. Thus you ſee the ſecond concluſion explained and proved alſo, that as Chriſt is the Author of the reſurrection of the body, ſo he is of the reſurrection of the ſoul too, it is he that raiſeth the ſoul to ſpiritual life.</p>
               <p>Now in the third place we are to ſhew the reaſon why this double quickning
<note place="margin">3 Why both comprehended under one term.</note> power is here comprehended under one term, <hi>I am the Reſurrection.</hi> Now that this double power of quickning, is to be underſtood here under this one term, we need not, I hope, ſpend time to prove: for that Chriſt ſpeaks here of the ſpiritual reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the ſpiritual life; this I take to be evident from Chriſts own expoſition in the words following; <hi>He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live:</hi> He that believeth in me, though he were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes before, yet he ſhall live the life of grace, therefore I am the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Again, that the reſurrection of the body is not here excluded, it may appear from the ſcope and intent of theſe words of Chriſt; for the ſcope of theſe words here, is to perſwade <hi>Martha</hi> that he was able of himſelf, by his own power to raiſe up her dead brother, to reſtore him to life, ſaith he, <hi>I am the reſurrection,</hi> I have power to reſtore ſpiritual life to the ſoul that is dead in ſin, and this is the greater work; therefore I am able to reſtore natural life to the dead body, to reſtore the body that is dead in the Grave to life again.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſons why this double power is here comprehended under one term, <hi>I am the reſurrection;</hi> the chiefe reaſons I take to be theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this double quickning power is here comprehended under one term, in regard of the Analogie, and proportion between theſe two, between the reſtoring of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to life, and the reſtoring the ſoul to life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in regard of the certain inſeparable connexion between theſe two.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 In regard of the Analogie.</note> I ſay in regard of the Analogie and proportion between theſe two, the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the body, and of the ſoul; now the proportion and analogie conſiſts e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in theſe four things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as in the reſurrection of the body, the living ſoul muſt firſt return to the dead body, and quicken it before it can riſe again: ſo here in the Reſurrection of the ſoul, the Spirit of grace muſt return to the ſoul that is dead in ſins, and quicken it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can riſe again: ſo that there is a ſimilitude in regard of the firſt beginning, and principle of this Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2.</note> ſecondly there is an analogie, and proportion, in regard of the point and term, the ſtate from which the Reſurrection is: for as in the reſurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the body riſeth from the ſtate of corruption, from the bondage of the Grave; So here in this reſurrection of the ſoul, the ſoul and the whole man riſeth from the ſtate of ſpiritual corruption, from the bondage of ſin.</p>
               <p>The third proportion is in regard of the eſtate to which a man riſeth: for as in the reſurrection of the body, a man ſhall riſe again without thoſe infirmities that the body had before, he ſhall riſe to lead another kind of life, a glorified life: ſo in this reſurrection of the ſoul the ſinner riſeth, and is raiſed up to lead a new kind of life, a <pb n="404" facs="tcp:47453:210"/>ſpiritual life: and therefore it is called <hi>Newneſs of life, Rom.</hi> 6.4. that we ſhould <hi>walk in newneſs of life:</hi> both in regard of the new principle, and fountain of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, the ſpring of grace in the ſoul. And in regard of the new effects, and new operations, which are anſwerable to the new root.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, there is a proportion alſo in regard of the perpetuity of both: for as in the Reſurrection of the body, the body ſhall riſe an immortal body, not ſubject to death any more; ſo here in the reſurrection of the ſoul, when the ſinner is reſtored to ſpiritual life, he is raiſed up to a durable immutable eſtate, he ſhall continue to live this life of grace, and the immortal ſeed that is put into him, it ſhall never die: ſo Chriſt ſaith, verſe 26. <hi>He that believeth in me,</hi> ſaith he, and ſo liveth, <hi>he ſhall never die,</hi> he is raiſed to an immutable eſtate, to ſuch a life as ſhall never be ſubject to ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al death again. Thus you ſee that analogie, and proportion between theſe two, and in this reſpect they may both be comprehended fitly under one term.</p>
               <note place="margin">2 In regard of the connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
               <p>Secondly in regard of the infallible connexion between theſe two: for whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the reſurrection of the ſoul to the life of grace goes before, there the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body to the life of glory will certainly follow after: for as the ſpiritual death of the ſoul did neceſſarily draw after it the mortality, and death of the body, ſo the ſpiritual life of the ſoul doth neceſſarily draw with it the immortality, and the reſurrection of the body: therefore as in the Sacrament the name of the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, is given to the ſign, in regard of the neer conjunction, and relation between them: ſo here in regard of the neer conjunction between theſe two, that they are never ſeparate, therefore they may both fitly be comprehended under one term. Thus we have endeavoured to expound the general doctrin in theſe three particulars. We have ſhewed you that Chriſt is the Author and fountain of the Reſurrection of the body: he hath the quickning power in him wherby he is able to raiſe thoſe bodies that are dead in the grave. Then he is the Author of the Reſurrection of the ſoul too; he is able to quicken thoſe ſouls that are dead in ſins. And then we have ſhewed the reaſons why theſe two, the Reſurrection of the body, and of the ſoul, are both comprehended under one phraſe of ſpeech, <hi>I am the Reſurrection.</hi> Now I come to the Uſe and Application of that, that hath been delivered. And the Uſe of the point is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, for comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for tryal and examination.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for exhortation, and direction,</p>
               <p>Firſt the Uſe of the point may be for comfort here,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Comfort.</note> here is matter of ſound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all thoſe that are the faithful members of Chriſt Jeſus: if thou be united to Chriſt by ſaith, Chriſt is the Fountain of life, he will be the Fountain of ſpiritual life: therefore here is comfort againſt Death, againſt the death of the ſoul, and againſt the death of the body.</p>
               <p>Comfort firſt againſt the death of the Soul,
<note place="margin">2 Againſt the death of the ſoul.</note> comfort againſt ſin, that is the ill of all ills, and is the death of the ſoul. If thou be united to Chriſt; Chriſt by his divine power he is able to free thee from the power and dominion of ſin, from the bondage of ſin. Doſt thou complain that thy underſtanding is dark and blind? remember Chriſt is able to give thee more light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light.</hi> Doſt thou complain that thy heart is hard and ſtony? remember that Chriſt is able to ſoften thy hard heart, and to give thee a heart of fleſh, as he hath promiſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.36. <hi>I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their ſtony heart, and give them an heart of fleſh.</hi> Doſt thou complain that thy affections are unruly, and ſet upon wrong objects? remember to thy comfort, that Chriſt is able to rectifie theſe affections, he is able to plant in thee the true love, and fear of God, as he hath promiſed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>I will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed; that thou ſhalt love me with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul.</hi> And in <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall never depart from me.</hi> Doſt thou complain that thou canſt not bear afflictions patiently? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Chriſt thy head, he is able to ſtrengthen thee, and he will do it, as he did the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. ſaith he, <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:47453:210"/>But here the weak Chriſtian will be ready to object:
<note place="margin">Object.</note> but I have ſo many ſtrong corruptions in me that I am afraid, that I am not yet raiſed out of the grave of ſin, that I am not yet raiſed out of my natural eſtate.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> remember this to thy comfort, that the firſt Reſurrection is unlike to the ſecond in this regard; in regard of the meaſure and degree of it: as ſoon as ever the ſoul quickens the dead body, the dead body leaves the Grave, and the ſtate of corruption wholly, and all at once; but it is not ſo in the Reſurrection of the ſoul. When the ſpirit quickens the ſoul, the ſoul begins to riſe again from the grave of ſin, but yet the bands and ſetters of ſin, and corruption ſtill remain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul. Indeed as ſoon as the Spirit of grace quickens the ſoul, the ſoul pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently hates all ſins, and begins to ſhake off theſe ſetters of ſin and corruptions, and ſhakes them off by little and little; but I ſay, it ſhakes them not off all at once. In this ſpiritual Reſurrection, ſin indeed receives a deadly wound, but yet it is not wholly aboliſhed. In the ſpiritual Reſurrection ſin is like a beaſt, whoſe throat is cut, that lies ſtriving and ſtrugling for life: ſo ſin hath life in it, but yet it hath a deadly wound: therefore remember to thy comfort, that that will be true here between the power of grace, and the remainders of ſin, that is affirmed of the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. there was long war between them, <hi>But the houſe of David grew ſtronger, and the houſe of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</hi> So it will be between ſin and grace, ſin will grow weaker, and weaker, and grace ſtronger and ſtronger.</p>
               <p>But yet the weak Chriſtian may object further:
<note place="margin">Object.</note> but I feel the ſpirit ſo weak in me, and the fleſh ſo ſtrong in me, that I am afraid the fleſh will prevail, and ſo I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to my natural eſtate.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> remember that this is contrary to the nature of a true Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to return to death again: for at the laſt Reſurrection, the bodies that are raiſed ſhall be immortal, never to die again: ſo here thoſe ſouls that are quickened to the life of grace, they are raiſed to a durable, immutable, immortal eſtate, never to die again. That which Chriſt ſaith of thoſe that ſhall be accounted worthy to attain the ſecond Reſurrection; the Reſurrection of the body, it is true here alſo: he ſaith thoſe that ſhall be accounted worthy of the world to come, of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to life, they ſhall never die: for they are as the <hi>Angels of Heaven, Luke</hi> 20.35, 39. Thoſe that partake of that Reſurrection can never die: ſo here thoſe that partake of this ſpiritual Reſurrection to the life of grace, they ſhall never die: this Reſurrection to the life of grace it ſhall continue in them. For the ſpirit of grace when he once cometh into the ſoul, and quickens it, it continues there, and remains there for ever: it is as a <hi>Well of water ſpringing up to eternal life,</hi> as Chriſt ſpeaks <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall drink of the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt, but the water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a well of water ſpringing up to everlaſting life.</hi> Now we know a ſtream of water is of a vaniſhing nature, yet if it be nouriſhed with a continual Fountain that can never be dry, the ſtream will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually run: ſo it is with the ſtream of grace in the ſoul, it is nouriſhed with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fountaine, ſuch a one as can never be dried up. Thus you ſee here is comfort againſt ſin, againſt the death of the ſoul. Thoſe that are united to Chriſt by faith, they may be aſſured that Chriſt will be to them a Fountaine of ſpiritual life.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 Againſt the death of the body.</note> here is comfort againſt the death of the body, againſt natural death. If thou be united to Chriſt, thou needeſt not to fear temporal death, remember that though <hi>the body be dead becauſe of ſin, yet the ſpirit is life,</hi> as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. The body, that is dead; that is, it is mortal and ſubject to death becauſe of ſin, but the ſpirit, the ſoul, that liveth, it paſſeth from the life of grace here, to the life of glory. Yea, and the body too that is laid in the Grave, notwithſtanding ſhall be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the quickening power of Chriſt. Remember Chriſt is thy head, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he being riſen from the dead, thou ſhalt not periſh. You know as long as the head of the natural body is above the water, none of the members of the body can be drowned: ſo it is here, as long as Chriſt is riſen, none of his members can be held captive in the Grave. Remember Chriſt is the firſt fruits of the dead, <hi>the firſt fruits of them that ſleep:</hi> therefore his Reſurrection may be a pledge, and an aſſurance to thee of <pb n="406" facs="tcp:47453:211"/>thy reſurrection; <hi>As we have borne the Image of the earthly,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſo we ſhall bear the Image of the heavenly</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. As we have borne about us theſe corruptible bodies, ſo when we riſe again, we ſhall riſe with immortal, and incorruptible bodies, and live a glorious life with Chriſt, and ſo be made conformable to Chriſt our head, therefore fear not the death of the body. Remember that Death can deſtroy nothing in thee but ſin, therefore fear not.</p>
               <p>This conſideration may comfort us, as againſt our own death, ſo againſt the death of our friends; Let us therefore receive comfort hence, as <hi>Martha</hi> in this Chapter; <hi>I know that my brother ſhall riſe again in the Reſurrection at the laſt day,</hi> and that did comfort her.</p>
               <p>But here this queſtion may be demanded;
<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> but is not this Reſurrection of the body, a benefit common to the wicked? are not they partakers of this benefit from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, as well as the godly? ſhall not they be raiſed, and quickned, as well as the godly, by Chriſt his Reſurrection?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Difference in the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wicked.</note> that this Reſurrection of the body to life, it is a benefit proper to the faithful, to the true members of Chriſt: for though unbeleevers, and wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall be raiſed up again; yet,</p>
               <p>By a different cauſe.</p>
               <p>And to a different end.</p>
               <p>I ſay firſt,
<note place="margin">1 In the cauſe.</note> by a different cauſe: the wicked that are out of Chriſt, cannot have any benefit from the Reſurrection of Chriſt, becauſe they are out of Chriſt, therefore they ſhall be raiſed indeed; but not by a quickning power flowing from the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt: but by the divine power, and command of Chriſt, as a juſt Judge: and they ſhall be raiſed by vertue of that curſe pronounced in Paradice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>In the day thou eateſt, thou ſhalt die the death;</hi> that includes eternal death: therefore this curſe muſt be executed upon them, and therefore they muſt riſe out of the Grave again, that body and ſoul may die eternally: but the faithful members of Chriſt ſhall be raiſed by the quickning power of Chriſt, as their head and Saviour.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2 In the end.</note> as the wicked ſhall be raiſed by a different cauſe, ſo to a different end: for they ſhall not be raiſed to life, to ſpeak properly, that ſtate is ſtiled eternal death, therefore their Reſurrection is ſtiled <hi>the reſurrection of condemnation, Job.</hi> 5.27. <hi>they that have done good ſhall come forth to the reſurrection of life, and they that have done ill to the reſurrection of condemnation;</hi> they ſhall not riſe to life, but to eternal death: but the godly only ſhall attain this Reſurrection of life, and therefore they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ſtiled the <hi>ſons of the reſurrection, Luke</hi> 20.36. So much may ſuffice for comfort.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Uſe of the point may be for trial and examination,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 2. Trial.</note> ſince we profeſs to be Chriſtians, to be members of Chriſt, let us here try the truth, whether we be ſo in deed or no. Chriſt is the Reſurrection: he is the Author of the firſt Reſurrection to a ſpiritual life. The firſt thing that Chriſt doth in the ſoul of a ſinner, is to raiſe the ſoul to a ſpiritual life: therefore examine whether thou have felt this quickning power or no, this firſt Reſurrection to a ſpiritual life. When Chriſt was upon the earth, he had power to raiſe up all thoſe to life again that died, but yet he raiſed but few; there are but three that we read of, thoſe that we named before. The Widdows ſon, <hi>Jairus</hi> Daughter, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> here. So likewiſe Chriſt now hath power to quicken all thoſe that are dead in ſin, to raiſe them to ſpiritual life, but yet he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens but few, in compariſon of thoſe that continue ſtill in their ſins. Therefore let us all examine our ſelves upon this point, whether we have attained the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or no. If we be true members of Chriſt, we partake of the firſt Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for Chriſt is a fountain of ſpiritual life to all his members: therefore examine this, look to the firſt reſurrection, to the Life of grace, thou maiſt know it briefly by three ſigns.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Signs of the firſt Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> by forſaking of ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by newneſs of life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by thy continual progreſs in both.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 Forſaking ſin</note> by thy forſaking of ſin, whether haſt thou left thoſe ſins thou formerly livedſt in? As in the Reſurrection of the body, as ſoon as the ſoul is united to the body, preſently the man leaves the Grave, he leaves the ſociety of the dead, and <pb n="407" facs="tcp:47453:211"/>comes forth: as <hi>Lazarus</hi> as ſoon as he was quickned, and his ſoul returned to his body, preſently he came forth, Verſ. 44. <hi>He that was dead came forth out of his grave.</hi> Examine therefore whether thou be come forth of the grave of ſin? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haſt thou left the ſociety of ſinners, of prophane perſons? and whether haſt thou left the grave of thy ſin? Is there not ſome luſt, ſome ſin that ſtill holds thee captive in this Grave, to which thou willingly, and wittingly obeyeſt? If thou live in any one known ſin, if thou be ruled by any one luſt, whatſoever it be, be it ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or drunkenneſs, or uncleanneſs, or covetouſneſs, or lying, or open and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prophaning of the Sabbath. I ſay, if thou live in the practice of any of theſe, or the like known ſins, this is a plain caſe, thou art ſtill in the noyſome grave of thy ſins: thou art not riſen out of the grave of thy ſins, and therefore thou art not quickned by the Spirit of Chriſt; and if thou art not quickned, then thou art not a member of Chriſt, thou art not a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">2 Newneſs of life.</note> Secondly, thou maiſt know it by the newneſs of thy life: whether doſt thou feel a ſpiritual life wrought in thee? and whether doth it appear outwardly? Doſt thou feel a ſpiritual life wrought inwardly? that ſpiritual life that. Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores to the Soul, is univerſally ſpread through the whole Soul. As when the Soul of a man quickens the body, it quickens the whole body, every member of it; ſo here the Spirit of Grace quickens the whole Soul. Therefore examine whether doſt thou find ſpiritual life wrought in thy whole Soul, or no? whether doſt thou find this change wrought in thy underſtanding and judgement? whether haſt thou a new judgement, and thoughts, and opinion of God, and of the wayes of God? a new opinion of Chriſt? a new opinion of the Members of Chriſt? Whether doſt thou find this change in thy heart and affections? whether haſt thou new deſires, new affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſpiritual inclinations? whether are the ſtudies, and deſires of thy ſoul ſet upon heavenly things? <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things that are above, Colloſ,</hi> 3.1. Whether are thy affections and meditations heavenly, and ſpiritual? Doſt thou feel this change inwardly in thy Soul?</p>
               <p>Again, doth this ſpiritual life appear outwardly alſo by thy ſpeeches and actions? Doth it appear outwardly in thy ſpeeches, is there a change there? canſt thou now ſpeak to men in the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and to God in the voice of his Spirit, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abba, Father?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, is there a change in thy outward actions? haſt thou left the ſociety of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? and doſt thou converſe with living Chriſtians? Doſt thou love thoſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in vertue? and doſt thou manifeſt the graces of the Spirit in the conſcionable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all the duties of thy general, and particular calling? As ſoon as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was quickened, preſently as he left the Grave, ſo he converſed with living men, and walked in his Calling: ſo examine if thou have left the ſociety of the dead, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with living Chriſtians, and delight in them; and whether thou walk on conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably in the place that God hath ſet thee in, making the Word of Chriſt the rule of all thy actions. If it be thus with thee, if thou feel this ſpiritual life wrought in thy ſoul, and it appear outwardly in all thy ſpeeches and actions; this is a good ſign thou partakeſt of the firſt Reſurrection to the life of Grace.</p>
               <p>In the third place,
<note place="margin">3 Progreſs in both.</note> thou maiſt know this alſo by thy progreſs in both theſe. Firſt, by the progreſs of thy Mortification: Is ſin daily more and more mortified in thee? Doſt thou daily get ground of thy corruptions? Is ſin in thee like the houſe of <hi>Saul,</hi> as that waxed weaker and weaker, ſo doth corruption in thee daily? Is ſin in thee like an old man, as it is in every member of Chriſt? and therefore it is ſtiled the old man; an old man grows weaker and weaker, till at the laſt he dyes: ſo it is with ſin in every Chriſtian, examine if ſin be ſuch an old man in you, that it grows weaker daily.</p>
               <p>Again, thou maiſt know it by thy progreſs in thy vivification: Doſt thou grow in grace daily? Is grace in thee, as the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> as that grew ſtronger and ſtronger, ſo doth grace in thee? Is grace like a young man, as it is in every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt? and therefore it is ſtiled the <hi>New man;</hi> becauſe it is as a young and luſty man that daily grows ſtronger, till he come to his full ſtrength, doth grace in thee grow ſtronger daily? and doſt thou go forward in thy Chriſtian courſe? It is <pb n="408" facs="tcp:47453:212"/>the duty of a Chriſtian to walk on daily in his Chriſtian courſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. we muſt walk on in <hi>newneſs of life.</hi> If thou find this progreſs in thy mortification, and vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, it is a good ſigne indeed that thou haſt attained to the firſt Reſurrection of the Soul to a ſpiritual life. Therefore let me intreat you to ſet upon this work of examination of your own hearts diligently, and faithfully. Let not the multitudes of worldly buſineſs: let not the allurement of vain objects, and vain company; let not the appetite and deſire of baſe pleaſures drive theſe thoughts out of your heads: but examine your own hearts whether you partake of the firſt Reſurrection, or no. Deceive not thy own ſoul: for though Conſcience may now ſleep, thou maiſt think thou art in a good eſtate; yet let me tell thee; the time will come when thy Conſcience will awake, that if thou continue to wallow in any one ſin, if there be no change in thee in thy life, in thy heart; if inſtead of growing better, thou grow worſe, and be hardened more and more in ſinful courſes, thy Conſcience will tell thee to thy face, thou art a dead man, thou haſt no part in Chriſt: for Chriſt is the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the Fountaine of ſpiritual life: thou haſt not yet attained the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the life of grace, and therefore if thou go on in this courſe, thou ſhalt not attaine to the ſecond Reſurrection, to the life of glory. So much for that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</p>
               <p>The third,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Exhortation direction.</note> and the laſt Uſe of the point is for exhortation; and direction. If now upon examination, thou find that thou haſt not yet attained to this ſpiritual Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; then let me counſel thee to give no reſt to thy ſoul, till thou haſt attained it: for remember that this is the firſt ſtep to heaven, and if thou ſet not the firſt ſtep to heaven, ſurely thou ſhalt never come thither. As the Reſurrection of Chriſt was the firſt degree of his exaltation: ſo this ſpiritual Reſurrection that we have ſpoken of, it is the firſt degree of a Chriſtians exaltation: therefore get this in the firſt place; yea, get this, and all will follow. If thou attain this, thou maiſt be aſſured of the ſecond Reſurrection alſo, to the life of glory. Remember that Chriſt by raiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the dead by his own power, declared himſelf to be the eternal Son of God: <hi>He was declared mightily to be the Son of God by his Reſurrection:</hi> So if thou canſt by a power and vertue drawn from Chriſt, riſe out of the grave of thy ſin, then thou ſhalt declare thy ſelf to be the member of Chriſt, the Son of God, the daughter of God: therefore labour to attain this firſt Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>But here this queſtion may be demanded:
<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> but by what means now doth Chriſt convey this ſpiritual life to his children? and how ſhall I get to be partaker of this Reſurrection? by what means ſhall I attain this firſt Reſurrection to this ſpirituall life?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer briefly, that by the ſame means by which Chriſt works faith in the ſoul,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> by the ſame means he raiſeth a ſinner to life: for he that beleeveth liveth, and he that liveth beleeveth; he that beleeveth is raiſed to life: therefore by the ſame means that Chriſt works faith, by the ſame means he raiſeth a ſinner to life. Therefore the outward means is the Preaching of the Word; the inward, the Spirit of grace. By ſuch means as Chriſt will raiſe the bodies of the dead at the laſt day, by the like means he now raiſeth the ſouls of thoſe that are dead in ſin. Now Chriſt will raiſe the bodies that are now dead in the Grave, at the laſt day. Firſt, by his voyce, <hi>John</hi> 5.28.29. and by the ſound of the Trumpet, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. <hi>The Trump ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible.</hi> And he ſhall raiſe them by his quickning Spirit. So by the like means Chriſt now raiſeth our ſouls that are dead in ſins: therefore if thou deſire to be raiſed out of the grave of ſin, let me counſel thee;</p>
               <p>Firſt, to attend diligently to the word of God, upon the preaching of the Goſpel. The word of Chriſt, is a quickning word, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.63. <hi>My Word is ſpirit and life.</hi> The voyce of Chriſt is a quickning voyce: as Chriſt by his voyce raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of his Grave; when Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Lazarus, Come forth;</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>Lazarus</hi> quickned, and came forth: ſo the voyce of Chriſt in the miniſtery of the Word hath a quickning power, to raiſe ſinners from the death of ſin: therefore when the Miniſters cry aloud, and the Prophets <hi>lift up their voyce as a Trumpet,</hi> then hearken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:47453:212"/>Secondly, be frequent, and fervent in Prayer for the Spirit of grace, and of Chriſt: before thou hear, pray; and after thou haſt heard, pray that the Spirit of Chriſt may accompany his Word, that ſo this may be a means to awaken, and to quicken thee out of thy natural eſtate, and to raiſe thee out of the death of ſin. Thou muſt pray to God to give thee a hearing ear, and a believing heart: that ſo the ſound of the Word may not be as the ſound of a Trumpet in the ears of a dead man, but that thou maieſt be quickned by the voyce of Chriſt. And though thou have continued a long time in thy ſins, yet be not altogether diſcouraged: remember that Chriſt is able to raiſe thee, though thou have continued never ſo long in thy ſins: for he that was able to raiſe <hi>Lazarus</hi> that was dead and buryed, and now ſtinking in the Grave, he is able to raiſe up thee alſo.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place (in one word) if upon examination, thou find thou have attained to this ſpiritual Reſurrection, then here is a ground of exhortation.<lb/>
To 
<list>
                     <item>humility,</item>
                     <item>To thankfulneſs.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Here is a ground of Exhortation to Humility and Thankfulneſs, to joyn them both together, becauſe they uſually go together: the proud perſon is alway un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful; and the humble man is alway a thankful man. Now if thou have attained to the Reſurrection thou haſt great cauſe to be humble, and to be thankful.</p>
               <p>Firſt, thou haſt great cauſe to be humbled, becauſe thou haſt nothing but that thou haſt received: thou haſt great cauſe to be humbled, becauſe thou putteſt not any hand to this work, no more than the dead body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> could help to the raiſing of him. No more then a creature being nothing, can help to its own creation; no more can a ſinner help forward this mork of his Reſurrection, therefore thou haſt cauſe to be humbled for not puting the leaſt helping hand to this work, it is wholly ſupernatural. Therefore let not any one arrogate any thing to the power of his free will, but remember the work is wholly ſupernatural.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as we have cauſe to be humbled, ſo to be thankful too, do but conſider the deſperate, and dangerous eſtate of ſin whence thou art raiſed, and then make thy humble confeſſion with the Iſraelites, when they brought their firſt fruits before God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.5. <hi>A Syrian ready to periſh was my father; he went into Egypt with a few;</hi> and become a Nation mighty, and populous, and the Lord brought him out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with a mighty hand, and an out-ſtretched arm, with terrour and ſigns, and wonders, and hath brought us to this place, and hath given us this Land, even a Land flowing with milk and honey. The like deliverance the Lord hath wrought for thee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be thankful, and make thy thankful acknowledgment with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. <hi>Not unto us, but to thy name give the glory.</hi> And then deſire God, as he hath by his mercy brought thee to the Kingdome of grace, ſo by his power to preſerve thee to the Kingdome of glory. And deſire Chriſt, as he by his quickning Spirit, hath made thee partakers of the firſt Reſurrection to the life of grace; ſo to make thee partaker of the ſecond to the life of glory.</p>

                     </gap> the Lord, and the fruit of the womb are his reward, happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.</hi> In former times, barrenneſs was accounted for a ſhame and reproach. When God would puniſh <hi>Abimelech,</hi> about <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife; it is ſaid, <hi>that he cloſed up all the wombs in the houſe of Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 20.18. And when God would bleſs <hi>Jobs</hi> laſt dayes more than his firſt, he gave him ſeven ſons, and three daughters, as an addition to his happineſs, and as ſo many emblems of his grace, and favour towards him. In there hearſing of the lives of the Fathers before the Flood, you ſhall find, eſpecially in <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. ſundry times thus, ſuch, and ſuch a one lived ſo many years, <hi>and begat ſons and daughters.</hi> What was the bleſſing upon the firſt couple? was it not this, <hi>be fruitful and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Gen.</hi> 1.28. What bleſſing gave the friends of <hi>Rebecca</hi> at her departure? was it not this, <hi>be the mother of thouſands, and millions, Gen.</hi> 24.60. What was the manner of Gods bleſſing the <hi>Jewes</hi> after their return from the captivity? was it not this, <hi>that their ſtreets ſhould be full of boyes, and girls? Zech.</hi> 8.5.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, it may ſerve for a twofold Uſe;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:47453:214"/>Firſt, it diſcovers the wretchedneſs of their fault, who grudg and repine at the increaſe of children as a burthen. Some there are that preſcrbe to God how many children he ſhould beſtow upon them, and would ſet him down a ſtint, that they would not by any means have him exceed; which argues a moſt miſerable, and a moſt faithleſs mind: For whence is this fear of increaſe before it come? and whence is this repining at it when it is come, but from ſome diſtruſtful opinion or other, that they conceive either of their inability to maintain them, &amp;c? Let me ſay to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, of your children, as our bleſſed Saviour ſaid of his Diſciples touching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; <hi>they are of more value then ſparrows,</hi> yet the Lord feeds them, together with <hi>the young Ravens that cry;</hi> how much more will he give ſupply to thoſe creatures that are ſtamped with his own Image.</p>
               <p>Neither is it only a reward and bleſſing upon the rich that they are fruitful, but it is even a reward and bleſſing to the poor, that they have children: for it is ſpecified in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.41. that <hi>God will make them a family like a flock of ſheep;</hi> and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table it is, that they ſhall have a family like a flock of ſheep, becauſe this may well be intended; they ſhall proſper and thrive with a little maintenance, as ſheep will grow fat, albeit the lees are but very ſhort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerves to direct all that deſire this bleſſing of increaſe, that they may know of whom to ſeek it; it is God that muſt make thee fruitful like <hi>Rachel;</hi> it is he that <hi>makes the barren to dwell with the family, and to be a joyful mother of Children.</hi> There are five ſpecial keyes that God reſerves in his own power.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, the key of the Rain; <hi>the Lord ſhall open his good treaſure, and the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to give Rain to the land, Deut.</hi> 28.12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the key of food; <hi>thou openeſt thy hand, and filleſt all things living with thy plenty, Pſal.</hi> 104.28.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the key of the grave; <hi>he bringeth down to the grave, and raiſeth up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the key of the heart; it is ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. <hi>the Lord opened the heart of Lydia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſtly, the key of the wombe; God remembred <hi>Rachel and opened her wombe, Gen.</hi> 30. <hi>Abraham</hi> therefore being childleſs, he makes his moan to God. <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac</hi> prayed to God for his Wife, becauſe ſhe was barren. <hi>Hanna, Samuels</hi> mother, poured out her ſoul to God in hearty prayer, when ſhe had no child. As alſo <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary,</hi> and <hi>Elizebeth,</hi> the parents of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt. This is the true courſe, firſt to God, and then to the means. <hi>Rachel</hi> was in a paſſion, and ſhe cryed to her Husband, <hi>give me children or elſe I die;</hi> but nothing of all this prevailed till ſhe ſought it of the Lord, and then ſhe was fruitful, that is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is recorded of her, that ſhe was not only fruitful; but that with this fruitfulneſs of hers, there came an increaſe of Gods people; ſhe built up a great part of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and what elſe were the <hi>Iſralites,</hi> but Gods peculiar people? A right chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed is called a true <hi>Iſraelite;</hi> and the elect are termed by Saint <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>the Iſrael of God:</hi> So then hence you may infer; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>The deſire of having Children, muſt aim at the increaſe, and ealargement of Gods Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a bleſſing indeed, when the wife by her off-ſpring builds up <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not <hi>Babel; Bethel,</hi> Gods houſe, not <hi>Bethaven,</hi> the houſe of iniquity. This was the deſire of holy people of old, when they prayed that their children might be as <hi>corner-ſtones, couched into the wals of the Temple;</hi> meaning thereby, that they might grow into the Temple of the Lord, to be a habitation of God by his Spirit: <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>that hath his quiver full of them:</hi> it is of ſuch children, that are as the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows <hi>of a ſtrong man.</hi> Whence it follows, that they muſt have more in them then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for arrows are not arrows by growth, but by Art: ſo they muſt be ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the knottineſs of whoſe nature, is refined, and reformed, and made ſmooth by grace.</p>

                  <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the ſon of the bond-woman had twelve ſons, and all Princes in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but what did all theſe titles of dignity do them good, as long as they were out of the promiſe? Queſtionleſs <hi>Hanna's</hi> drieft in deſiring a ſon of God, was, that out of her might come one, by whom Gods glory might be advanced among men, therefore ſhe vowed him to the Lord all the daies of his life. The Angel told <hi>Zachary</hi> that he ſhould have joy and gladneſs at the birth of his ſon, why? <hi>Becauſe he ſhould be great in the ſight of the Lord, and ſilled with the holy Ghoſt, and turn many to the Lord,</hi> Luk. 1.50. He that begets a fool, that is, an ungodly irreligious ſon: for that is one of <hi>Solomons</hi> fools, he <hi>gets himſelf ſorrow, and the father of ſuch a one ſhall have no joy;</hi> but he ſhall be his very calamity, and his meer vexation. It is a rule ſet down in Scripture, that whatſoever is done, ſhould be done to the glory of God: therefore our deſire of having children muſt aim at this, that out of our loyns may come ſuch, by whom Gods glory may be promoted, and the number of the godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in the world.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 Obedient.</note> ſhe is recorded to have yeelded in all willingneſs, and readineſs to the deſire of her Husband: When <hi>Jacob</hi> was warned by an Angel from God, to return from <hi>Laban</hi> to the Land where he was born; he made his wives acquainted with the matter, and diſcovered to them his whole intent and purpoſe: they forth-with gave him this yeelding, and reſpective anſwer; <hi>Whatſoever God hath ſaid unto thee, that do,</hi> Gen. 31.11. The like is to be ſeen in <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſhe was no hindrance to <hi>Abraham</hi> in his removal from his own Country to <hi>Canaan;</hi> no, nor at ſuch time when ſhe was ignorant whither he went: ſhe was no hindrance to him in the ſpeedy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of his ſon; No, nor ſhe did not go about to hinder him, in the very ſacrificing of his ſon. Out of all doubt, if ſhe had been a clog to him in any of theſe reſpects the Spirit of God would never have concealed it, becauſe the wreſtling with her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs, and gain-ſaying, had been a ſtrong evidence of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, that the Scripture is very careful to ſet out to the full, for his credit and our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>There are two Women ſtoried in the Scripture above others as examples of Gods judgment upon the untowardneſs of Wives, not joyning with, and incouraging their Husbands in good-doing. The one is <hi>Lots</hi> Wife, whoſe love no queſtion was a great delay to <hi>Lot</hi> in his departure from <hi>Sodome,</hi> that when ſhe ſhould have gone on with her Husband in haſt to the place which was appointed for their refuge without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, ſhe drew behind ſtill, lingring after her wonted home; but what was the iſſue? ſhe was turned into a Pillar of ſalt. The other was <hi>Michal</hi> the wife of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when ſhe looked out, and ſaw <hi>David</hi> dance before the Ark, ſhe deſpiſed him in her heart, and was ſo far from approving his zeal, that when he returned, ſhe entertained him with a frump, ſaying to him, <hi>What a fool was the King of Iſrael this day:</hi> but what was the iſſue of it? a puniſhment was inflicted on her for her fault, that ſhe had no child all the dayes of her life, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.23.</p>
               <p>I remember a policie of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in his Epiſtle he wrote to <hi>Philemon:</hi> he writes to him for the re-entertainment of a runnagate ſervant that he had begotten to God in his bonds, and for the better effecting of it in his inſcription, he not only writes to <hi>Philemon,</hi> but joyns with him <hi>Philemons</hi> wife, <hi>To Philemon our dearly beloved, and to our beloved Apphia,</hi> Philem. 1, 2. Wherefore was this? For nothing elſe I beleeve, but to warn her of her duty, that when the receiving of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to her Husband, as a needful duty, and a thing pleaſing to Almighty God, ſhe ſhould not put in her ſpoke to withſtand the motion, but further it by all the means ſhe could. It was to this end that the woman was created, that ſhe might be a help to her Husband in all honeſt offices, to joyn with him, to incourage him, to provoke him, and aſſiſt him in the performance of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly,
<note place="margin">4 Her death.</note> to omit many other things recorded of her, that I might here relate to you, and to come to that that more neerly concerns this preſent occaſion, it is ſaid of <hi>Rachel,</hi> ſhe died in travel. God had commanded <hi>Jacob</hi> to riſe, and go up to <hi>Bethel,</hi> and dwell there: he obeyed, and erected a Pillar in the place where God talked with him: thence he journeyed a little further to <hi>Ephrath,</hi> and there <hi>Rachel</hi> travelled, and had hard labour: in the ſufferance of which, which might be ſome <pb n="415" facs="tcp:47453:215"/>eaſe, ſhe received a great deal of comfort from her Midwife, who bad her not fear, for ſhe ſhould have this ſon alſo: but <hi>it came to paſs as her ſoul was departing, for ſhe died, that her ſons name was called Benoni,</hi> that is, a ſon of ſorrow, as we ſee verſe 18.</p>
               <p>Who can expreſs the woe of that day? and the bitterneſs of that loſs to <hi>Jacob?</hi> who was now bereſt of his dearly-beloved Wife, by the fruit of whoſe wombe he had reaped ſuch increaſe of bleſſing? before, the children had the care of two watching over them; now only of one, and that ſuch a one as was not accuſtomed to intereſt himſelf in training up young Children, but left it to her, and ſhe took it from him. O death void of mercy, and reſpect of perſons! that ſhe ſhould die, it was ſome grief to him, but that ſhe dyed in travel, that did moſt trouble him, and increaſe his grief. And well might he ſtile their ſon <hi>Benony,</hi> the ſon of ſorrow: for it was indeed a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to them all: to her, to him, to their iſſue, to their friends, and acquaintance, to their ſervants, to all that knew them, or had any relation to them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Jacob</hi> will not exceed the bounds of Chriſtianity, he was at the laſt comforted: he refers himſelf, his children, his infinite, and almoſt inſupportable loſs to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties pleaſure, from him ſhe was received, and to him he is content again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all. The mourning, and lamenting that he made on her behalf it could not recal her again: all the tears he could ſhed for her, were of no force or power at all to make her alive; too much ſorrow might happily indanger his own life, and then he ſhould highly offend againſt Almighty God, Patience and Chriſtian fortitude were the only remedies left him, and theſe he reſolves on.</p>
               <p>Let us learn hence as long as the world laſts, to know that worldly comforts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be, and howſoever we may eſteem of them, they are ſubject to change. Love with unfeignedneſs what may be ſo loved, but take heed you love not too much, for fear the taking of that away from you, that was ſo dearly loved of you, make you fall into impatience, and ſin againſt God.</p>
               <p>Let us ſo love that we may think of loſs, if it ſtand with Gods pleaſure; but yet let us ſo love, that we eſteem it no loſs if he pleaſe. Let his good will, and pleaſure ever-more moderate our affections: ſo happily we ſhall enjoy the thing beloved, a great deal longer. But if we exceed in lamenting, were we as juſt, and righteous as <hi>Jacob,</hi> God will be angry with us for it. Not only thy deareſt Wife, but thy deareſt Child, thy deareſt friend; whatſoever is moſt dear to thee, ſhall then feel the ſtroak of mortality, that the heart may be taught to wiſh for eternity, crying heavily, and ſighing with a mournful voyce, with thoſe words of the Preacher, <hi>Vanity of vanities all is but vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a threefold puniſhment inflicted upon all women kind in anſwer to the three ſins committed by our Granmother <hi>Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe ſhe gave too much credit to the words of the Serpent, telling her, that both <hi>Adam</hi> and ſhe ſhould be as Gods, knowing good and evil; therefore it was pronounced preſently upon her, that her ſorrows and conceptions ſhould be multiplied.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe againſt the expreſs command of Almighty God, ſhe did eat the forbidden fruit, therefore it was pronounced againſt her, that in ſorrow ſhe ſhould bring forth Children, every time her hour was at hand ſhe ſhould hardly eſcape death. I need not enlarge my ſelf, you all know it to be too true; nay ſometimes, and that oft-times too it coſts your lives: an example we have here in the Text in <hi>Rachel,</hi> and in our deceaſed Siſter here before us, and many others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, becauſe ſhe was a ſeducer of her Husband; therefore for a puniſhment, all your deſires ought to be ſubject to your Husbands, and by the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Scripture they muſt rule over you. Death is a debt to nature and muſt be payed: there is no avoyding of it, no putting it off, when GOD thinks it fit, it is infallible to all, in reſpect of the matter, and end: though in reſpect of the time and manner, many times it be divers. Some die when they are young; ſome in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of their age, and ſome live till they be very old. That for the time.</p>
               <p>Some die of Convulſions, ſome of Dropſies, ſome of Feavers: and to be ſhort, ſome in Child-bed; as <hi>Rachel</hi> here did, and our departed ſiſter. But of what deſeaſe <pb n="416" facs="tcp:47453:216"/>ſoever they die, that is nothing: die they muſt ſooner or later, of this infirmity; or that, it is no matter which, when it pleaſeth God; Let a man make what ſhew he can with all his glorious adornations. Let him have rich apparel, and diſguiſed linnen; and ſearcloth, and balm, and ſpices, let him be inwrapped in lead, and let ſtone immure him when he is dead, yet the earth his original Mother will again own him for her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Child, and triumph over him with theſe, or the like inſultings, he is in my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, returned to his earth.</p>
               <p>This body returns not immediatly to heaven, but to the earth; nor to the earth neither as a ſtranger, and altogether unknown to him, but to his earth, appropriate to him as his own, his familiar friend, and old acquaintance. To conclude, we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and therefore we muſt die, we are full of evil, and therefore we muſt go to the grave: we have ſins enough to bring us all thither. God grant they be not ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and full of ominous precipitations that they portend our ſudden ruin? portend it they do, but <hi>O nullam ſit in omnia,</hi> &amp;c. I am loath to be redious. He ſhould not be redious that reads a lecture of mortality. How many in the world ſince this Sermon firſt began, have made an experimeut, and proof of this truth, of this ſentence, that man is mortal; and thoſe ſpectacles are but examples of this truth; they come to their period, before my ſpeech. My ſpeech, my ſelf, and all that hear me, all that breath in this ayr muſt follow. It hath been ſaid we live to die; give me leave a little to invert it, let us live to live, live the life of grace, that we may live the life of glory, and then though we do die, let us never fear it, we ſhall riſe from the dead again, and live with our God out of the reach of the dead, for ever, and ever. So much for the Text at this time.</p>
               <p>To declare unto you the cauſe of this preſent aſſembly would be altogether ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, the dumb oratory of that ſilent object, doth give you to underſtand in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſufficiently intelligible, that we are now met to perform the laſt rites and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that we owe to the memory of our dear ſiſter here before us. And Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath been ſo powerful in all ages, that it hath been retained as a pious, and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cuſtome at Funeral ſolemnities to adorn the dead, with the deſerved praiſes of their life: not for any pomp or vain-glorious oſtentation, but that Gods glory here may be for ever magnified, by whoſe grace they have been enabled to <hi>fight a good fight:</hi> and that the ſurviving may be encouraged to run the ſame courſe, when they behold them diſcharged of this tedious combat, and crowned with a crown of glory, and immortality.</p>
               <p>This Siſter of ours was born in this pariſh, and hath lived in it ſome thirty four years, or there-about; eighteen years a ſingle woman, and ſixteen years a married Wife; of whom though upon my own knowledge I can ſpeak but little, yet having credible information from others, with whom ſhe had long, and private intimacy of many years acquaintance, I muſt, and will ſpeak.</p>
               <p>That which I told you was recorded of <hi>Rachel,</hi> that ſhe was fruitful in procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Children, may in a great meaſure be ſpoken of her: for if the Scripture account bearing but of two children fruit: certainly it will make an extraordinary fruit in bearing of twelve, which ſhe did. It is a certaine token of a true, and faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, to frequent his houſe, to pray unto him, to praiſe him in his Church ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly; to labour to be inſtructed in his will out of his Word, then, and there, read and preached to them: all which evidences of a good Chriſtian were found in this our Siſter. For her conſtant coming to Church, I my ſelf can now ſpeak upon my own knowledge, I have ſeriouſly, and ſtrictly examined my ſelf, and I profeſs ingeniouſly before God that knows my heart, and you that here me ſpeak, that I cannot call to mind, that ever ſhe miſt coming to Church twice a Sabbath day ſince I came, which I would be heartily glad I could ſpeak as well of others of this Pariſh, as of her. For ſome of them have got ſuch a fisking trick up and down, to go to other Churches, as if there were no relliſhable food at their own, that I fear at the laſt they will come to none at all, I pray God they amend this fault. It was a vertue in her that deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed commendation, and it is a vice in them that deſerves reprehenſion.</p>
               <p>When ſhe was in Gods houſe, ſhe did not as too too many do, imploy her time in ſleeping, or ſome ſuch ill courſe: but I ever obſerved her to liſten very diligently, <pb n="417" facs="tcp:47453:216"/>and attentively to what was delivered, for the nouriſhing of her ſoul. I confeſs I do not remember that ever I ſaw her take any notes in the Church of Sermons that were preached: for it ſeems ſhe did it when ſhe came home: for ſince her death, going to her houſe, accidentally I met with a book of hers, wherein ſhe had written many texts of Scripture with notes: the day when they were preached, and the perſons by whom, moſt of thoſe which I have preached I ſaw and peruſed, and others of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that I my ſelf have heard: theſe qualities are not to be paſt over in ſilence, but are worthy of your ſerious imitation.</p>
               <p>Neither did ſhe think it fit barely to ſet them down for her own inſtruction only: but what ſhe heard upon the Sabbath day that ſhe conſtantly practiſed upon the week dayes. She catechiſed her children in thoſe points; ſpending ſome time in training them up in the knowledge of God, and putting them in mind of their duty to him in whom <hi>we live and move, and have our being,</hi> by repeating Gods word deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by hearing them read Gods word printed, and by ſinging Pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs.</p>
               <p>That ſhe was a moſt provident, and careful Wife, and a moſt indulgent, and loving Mother, all that knew her can beſt teſtifie, and ſome of them have informed me. And this let me ſpeak, and I have it from the mouth of ſome, that prehaps did not think I would have mentioned it at this time, and would have had it concealed, but for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beſt known to my ſelf, I hold it very fit to relate: ſhe was ever held to be of a moſt ſweet nature, and of a very loving diſpoſition; that ſhe was very charitable, and inclined to relieve the poor; It is likewiſe teſtified of her, ſhe was liberal alway; but more liberal now then uſually, having had a conſideration of the hard and needy times: to which end, as if ſhe had prognoſticated her own death, ſhe laid ſome money (according to that ability that God had bleſſed her with) for the relief of the poor.</p>
               <p>Let no man cenſure me for ſpeaking theſe things I do: for if I ſhould not have given her, her juſt, and deſerved praiſes; ſome that now hear me, and knew her from her cradle, might juſtly have cenſured me for too much remiſneſs. Thus for her life.</p>
               <p>As for her death, I can ſay little touching it. It pleaſed God, not to give her any long time of ſickneſs, but to take her away; though not unprepared, yet on a ſudden with a ſhort warning. When her bitter pangs firſt came upon her, ſhe called to her Husband, and deſired him to joyn with her in hearty prayer to Almighty God, that he would be graciouſly pleaſed to extend his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her; that he would be pleaſed to let her live longer, that ſhe might repent of her ſins, and beg mercy at his hands for them, that ſhe might amend her life. And if he would not grant this for her, yet for thoſe many poor Children that were young, that ſhe was to leave behind her; ſhe deſired him to be a careful Father over them all: ſhe prayed to God devoutly to ſend a bleſſing both upon him, and them.</p>
               <p>Much ſhe could not then ſpeak, becauſe of her pains, that now began ſtill to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe upon her. When ſhe was in the extremity of her labour, he being abſent (as it was fitting) ſhe ſent down to him, to deſire him to pray to God on her behalf, that he would eaſe her of thoſe grievons pains, and preſerve her in the great pain, and peril of Child birth. The propitious God it ſeemed heard him, and granted his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: for preſently to the thinking of the ſtanders by, ſhe was well delivered. Not ſatisfied with this, having received ſo great a bleſſing from God, ſhe ſent down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to deſire him, to give God thanks for her ſafe delivery. But God, that had determined to take out of this miſerable life, quickly turned that hope of the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by into a fear, and ſuddenly ſhe changed: which perceiving, as long as ſhe was able to ſpeak, ſhe cried, Lord Jeſus have mercy on my ſoul, Lord have mercy on me, Lord pitty me poor miſerable wretch: and when ſhe could not ſpeak, ſhe held up her hands to heaven, as deſirous to make her peace with that God, whom ſhe knew ſhe had highly offended. I make no queſtion, but God hath tranſlated her from the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of tears, to the Mount Sion of bleſſedneſs: whither God of his infinite mercy bring us all.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He intent of this Chapter,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coherence.</hi>
                  </note> is to take off an abuſe of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, which publiſheth the free Grace of God to great ſinners. The Apoſtle had ſaid in the latter end of the 20. Verſe of the former Chapter, <hi>where ſin abounded, Grace did much more abound.</hi> From hence ſome did infer; that therefore under the Goſpel they might take liberty to ſin; the more their ſins were, and the greater they were, the more they ſhould occaſion God to manifeſt his abundant Grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. This the Apoſtle anſwers in this Chapter, and he anſwers it two wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by way of deteſtation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by way of confutation.</p>
               <p>By way of deteſtation in the firſt verſe, and part of the ſecond, <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, ſhall we continue in ſin that Grace may abound? God forbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by way of confutation; the argument whereby he confutes it, is by a neceſſary conſequence of our juſtification; that is, our ſanctification: theſe are ſo <pb n="420" facs="tcp:47453:218"/>inſeparably united together, all that are juſtified, are ſanctified. And upon this ground, the Apoſtle frames two arguments to confute this errour, taken from the two parts of ſanctification.</p>
               <p>The firſt is from our mortification, from the third verſe, to the end of the ſeventh; and the argument runs thus. Thoſe that are dead to ſin, cannot ſin that Grace may abound; but all that are in Chriſt, are dead to ſin; therefore they cannot ſin that Grace may abound. Now that all that are in Chriſt are dead to ſin; he proves by their union with Chriſt, teſtified in Baptiſme, and by the effect of that union, which is conformity to Chriſt; that as Chriſt was dead for ſin, ſo they are dead to ſin.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument, is taken from the ſecond part of our ſanctification, which is our quickning to a new life; and that he handles in the 8, 9, 10. verſes, and that argument runs thus. Thoſe that are quickned by Chriſt to newneſs of life, cannot ſin that Grace may abound: but all that are in Chriſt, are quickned by Chriſt to newneſs of life; therefore they cannot ſin that Grace may abound. That all that are in Chriſt are quickned to newneſs life; he proves in verſe 8. <hi>If we be dead with Chriſt, we beleeve that we ſhall live with him ſtill,</hi> by our union with Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there comes a conformity to Chriſt in his reſurrection, as well as in his death.</p>
               <p>And from theſe premiſes, he infers by way of application, the concluſion that is here in the words of the Text I have now read to you; <hi>likewiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves dead unto ſin, but alive to God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, do not reſt your ſelves ſatisfied in the bare knowledge of theſe things, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of them in general, but bring them to particular application, make the caſe your own; what we ſay of death to ſin, and of newneſs of life, we ſpeak to you, if ye be in Chriſt; therefore you muſt make account of it to be your caſe, <hi>likewiſe reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ye your ſelves dead to ſin, but alive to God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> We ſee now the coherence of the words with thoſe that go before, and the main intent and ſcope of the Apoſtle in the Chapter,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 1.</note> wherein we might note divers things.</p>
               <p>The firſt is out of the very connexion, that <hi>by vertue of the union of beleevers with Chriſt, there is in them a conformity to Chriſt.</hi> They are made like unto him; he had ſaid before, that Chriſt died, and roſe again; likewiſe reckon ye your ſelves like him in this. Every one that is in Chriſt, is conformable to Chriſt, and made like him.</p>
               <p>Then again ſecondly, we might note hence this alſo; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>Rectified and ſanctified reaſon,
 ever concludes to God, and for God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Reckon ye, make account, conclude this, ſo the word ſignifieth, reaſon thus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thus; as it is uſed <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>We conclude</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, where the ſame word is uſed) <hi>That a man is juſtified by Faith without the works of the Law.</hi> So, conclude this, reſt on this concluſion, do not make it a matter of conjecture, and opinion onely: but when you conſider things wiſely, when you weigh things ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you ſhall ſee great reaſon to infer thoſe things, from theſe premiſes that God would have you infer. Therefore whatſoever reaſoning is againſt the Word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever diſputes the minds of men uphold againſt any truth in Scripture, it is but the reaſoning of corrupt reaſon; If reaſon were ſanctified, it would conclude, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>We judge, if one died for all, then they that live, ſhould not live to themſelves, but to him that died for them.</hi> When men come to deal judiciouſly, and adviſedly, when they come to conclude of things wiſely; they will conclude then, that what uſe the Word and the Goſpel would have them make of any truth, that they will make of it, <hi>Likewiſe reckon ye,</hi> judge thus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we might note hence thus much alſo; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>The beſt and moſt profitable knowledge of the Scriptures,
 is in applying it to a mans own caſe, and perſon, and condition.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reckon ye alſo your ſelves,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; make account of thus much, that <pb n="421" facs="tcp:47453:218"/>this is a truth concerns you in particular. Judge your ſelves ſo far profited by the Word you hear, as you can make good application of it to your own eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Whenſoever men come to hear the Word, they come to hear, ſomewhat that concerns themſelves, therefore whatſoever we ſay befals them that are in Chriſt; apply it to your ſelves, and make account this is my caſe, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, hence we might note thus much alſo; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>When a man is in Chriſt,
 there is a real change.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſervat.</hi> 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There is an evident change from what he was, before he was in Chriſt. For ſo the Apoſtle reaſons; now you are in Chriſt, there is ſuch a change, as from death to life, there is a marvellous great change in you. If there be not this change in you, neither are you in Chriſt; and all the hopes you build on of being in Chriſt, they are without a foundation, they are upon an imaginary Chriſt, not upon Chriſt that is yours indeed. If you be in Chriſt, let it appear in a change, let us ſee how you are changed ſince you were in Chriſt, from that you were before: for this make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, conclude thus much for your ſelves; that all that are in Chriſt are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

There is a change in all that are in Chriſt as from death to life.</note> and laſtly, he expreſſeth wherein this change confiſteth; and he makes choice of ſuch terms as are moſt acquiſite, and ſit for his purpoſe. He would expreſs this ſpiritual change, and mark what expreſſions he uſeth to manifeſt it by; no leſs then life, and death. There is ſuch a change when you are once in Chriſt, from what you were before; as there is between a man that was dead, and is now alive; or a man that was alive, and is now dead; and this is that, that I will infiſt now upon, wherein note theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Analogy and proportion, the aptneſs, and fitneſs of the terms, wherein the Apoſtle expreſſeth the ſpiritual change of thoſe that are in Chriſt; how ſitly they may be ſaid to be dead, and alive.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is obſervable in what order the Apoſtle expreſſeth theſe firſt dead, and then alive. Make account that the work of Grace in the effectual change in your hearts, it proceeds in this order. Firſt you are dead, and then alive; dead to ſin firſt, and then alive to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, note the certain connexion of theſe two together; ſo there is not onely a certainty in the object, but a certainty in the ſubject too; not only a certainty that thoſe that are in Chriſt ſhall live: but it is certain to you, make account of this, make this concluſion for your ſelves, build on it, know it for your ſelves, as he ſaid to <hi>Job;</hi> it is certain if you be in Chriſt, you are dead with Chriſt, and you ſhall live with Chriſt, make account of this.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the efficient cauſe of this great change expreſt in theſe terms, it is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> make account of this, if you be in Chriſt, there comes a vertue from Chriſt, an effectual working of Chriſt by his ſpirit in your hearts; ſuch a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work as will conforme you to Chriſt dead, and to Chriſt riſen; that you ſhall be dead to ſin, and alive to God: not by any ſttength in your ſelves, or any excellent endowment in your own natures, not by any natural inclination and ability, but through the vertue and power of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord</hi> working in you. Thus you have the Text opened.</p>
               <p>We will ſpeak firſt of the Analogy and proportion,
<note place="margin">1 The analogy between ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal life and death.</note> the agreement between the metaphors here uſed, and the things expreſt by them. That which the Apoſtle would expreſs, is, that there is a marvellous ſpiritual real change, in all thoſe that are in Chriſt, from what they were before. Now let us ſee how ſitly it is expreſt in theſe words, that he ſaith, <hi>you are dead to ſin, and alive to Ged;</hi> that he chuſeth to expreſs it by life and death. Had it not been fit to have ſaid thus much; you are changed in your diſpoſitions, in your inclinations, in your intentions, in your actions; you are changed in your converſations, you are other kind of men in the inclination of your hearts; you bring forth other fruit, you lead other lives then you were wont to do? But he expreſſeth it here yet more fully; that is, by that that includes all theſe; and if there be any thing more may be added, it includes that too, ye are dead and alive. Then we will conſider;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:47453:219"/>Firſt, generally, how death, and life, expreſs the ſtate of them that are in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider them in their particular application; how death expreſſeth the firſt part of a mans change in ſanctification, and life the ſecond part.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we take them in general, and let this be the point; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>A man that is indeed effectually changed by vertue of his union with Chriſt; he hath ſuch a change wrought in him, as in a dead, and living man; as in life, or in death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now,
<note place="margin">1 In general. 1 A General change.</note> firſt take it in general; you know life, and death, they imply, firſt a general change; when a man is alive, or when a man is dead, there is not a change in ſome part only, but in the whole: So it is here, when a man is effectually changed from what he was, by vertue of his union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>A member may be dead, and yet nevertheleſs the man alive; but if the man be dead, there is a general change that goes throughout, it poſſeſſeth every part, every member; ſo that now there is no member of him, but death rules in it, then he is a dead man. So it is in this, when a man is dead ſpiritually, there is not a change in ſome particular actions only, in ſome particular opinions only; there is not an alteration of ſome of his old cuſtoms only; but it is a general change, ſo it goes through the whole man. It is a change in the underſtanding, he judgeth things otherwiſe then he was wont to do. And there is a change in the will; the inclination of it is to other objects then he was wont to be inclined to. And thence there is a change in his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he propounds other ends to himſelf then he was wont. So there is a change in reſpect of the whole; the Word is the rule of all a mans actions. There is a change from particular evils, from one as well as another; that when any thing is diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him to be a ſin, to be a tranſgreſſion of the rule; he is turned from it. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when any thing is diſcovered to him to be a duty, agreeable to the rule accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God revealed in his Word; he is a veſſel of honour prepared for it: and that is it the Apoſtle eſpecially means, when he compares them to veſſels, and he deſcribes them thus; they are veſſels of honour fit for the ſervice of their Maſter, prepared for every good work: So that now as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there remaineth no more conſcience of ſin.</hi> That is, there remains not now any ſin to cleave to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to defile it, to cleave to the conſcience ſo, as a ruling enemy would do, that would take away all true and perfect peace; all boldneſs, and acceſs to the throne of Grace, there is no ſuch conſcience of ſin. This making conſcience of every ſin, is that that frees conſcience from being defiled in that ſence with any ſin; ſo much for the firſt.</p>
               <p>Well,
<note place="margin">2 The orderly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</note> ſecondly it is expreſſed by death, and life, to ſhew the orderlineſs in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of this change. When a man is changed by the efficacy and working of Chriſt to whom he is united; it proceeds in ſuch a manner, as the change in death or life. You know death, or life, begin within firſt; it begins in the inward man, in the heart firſt. And as in natural death, or natural life; there is a dying firſt of the root, and a quickning firſt at the root: So likewiſe in ſpiritual death, or life; it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly proceeding, it begins firſt within. Our Saviour Chriſt gives this direction; <hi>Firſt make the inſide clean,</hi> and then all will be clean; againſt the hppocriſie of the Scribes, and Phariſees, that looked more to outward actions. So this change, it is not only a meer civilizing of a man, a conforming of him to that ſociety he converſeth with in outward actions; but renewing of a man in the <hi>ſpirit of his mind,</hi> Rom. 12.2. So the change begins from within.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that firſt he is good, and then he doth good, according to the ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>make the tree good, and then the fruit will be good,</hi> we will not ſtand upon it: you ſee the Analogie, and agreement holds between theſe two in general.</p>
               <p>Now we come to take them apart more ſpecially:
<note place="margin">2 The Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</note> Firſt, how this being dead to ſin, agrees with that change that is in a man that is in Chriſt from ſin; <hi>Reckon this,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, make account of this, that you are dead to ſin: that is, now there is ſuch a change and turning from your evil courſes, from whatſoever it is that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="423" facs="tcp:47453:219"/>and properly called ſin in Scripture, you are changed from it. Now in whatſoever ſence a man may be ſaid to be dead, in that ſence a man in Chriſt is changed from ſin, there is ſomewhat in his change expreſſing that death. Now there is a threefold death,
<list>
                     <item>A Civil Death.
<note place="margin">Death three<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fold.</note>
                     </item>
                     <item>A Judicial Death.</item>
                     <item>A Natural Death.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>We begin with the judicial firſt,
<note place="margin">1 Judicial.</note> as Gods great Work begins in the judgment. There is a judicial death; ſo one that is alive now in reſpect of natural life, may yet be ſaid to be judicially dead, when he is dead in ſentence; when by the Judge he is condemned to death, when he is adjudged to die. <hi>So reckon ye your ſelves dead to ſin;</hi> make account of this, that now in your judgment there is a ſentence paſſed out againſt ſin, that it ſhall be ſlain, that it ſhall be mortified; thus your judgment ſtands, and thus you look upon it, as a thing dead in ſentence; and that is the firſt. It is that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. ſaith the Lord, <hi>When I ſhall be pacified to thee,</hi> this ſhall follow upon it; <hi>thou ſhalt judge thy ſelf worthy to be deſtroyed, for all thine iniquities and abominations.</hi> When God is reconciled to a man, which is as much as to ſay, when a man is in Chriſt: for by Chriſt we are reconciled to God, this follows upon it, that man comes now to judge ſin to be a deadly thing, to judge ſin to be dead, and to judg himſelf worthy to be deſtroyed for it. He looks on ſin as it ſhould be looked upon, his opinion is right concerning it: he accounts it an iniquity, a thing againſt that rectitude, againſt that equity, and righteouſneſs wherewith man was once endowed in the Creation; and from which ſo far as he ſwarves, ſo far he is plunged into death. As you know that curſe was denounced againſt man when he ſinned he ſhould die: ſo he cannot look upon iniquity, upon that that is contrary to that righteouſneſs wherein he was made, but he looks upon it, as on death it ſelf, and a deadly thing; he looks upon it as upon an abomination. That look as perſons that ſinned capitally were an abomination to the Land, and people among whom they ſinned; as the Scripture ſpeaks of murtherers, and the like; the land was defiled if the ſentence of death were not executed; ſo it is here in the opinion and judgment of a man that is in Chriſt, he accounts this the greateſt defilement, that his ſoul remains ſo far polluted and defiled, as there is any life left in ſin. That is the firſt thing, reckon this then that ſin is dead immediatly; that is, that you now come to paſs (as Judges do) a ſentence of death againſt ſin: and that howſoever a Malefactour be not naturally dead, when he is judicially dead; yet he is in an order to it, the next thing that follows will be to be cut off. So it is with ſin, when a man comes to judge himſelf for his iniquity, worthy to be deſtroyed for his abominations, this is the next thing that follows, he will not reſt, till that be ſlain and ſubdued, till that Malefactour be condemned to death, and cut off and took out of the way. Here is the firſt thing, herein this change is like death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a civil death too; ſo one that lives naturally, may be dead civilly; ſo one that is under the ſubjection and power of another,
<note place="margin">2 Civil.</note> ſuch a one is dead civilly. The civil Law accounts any one that is under ſubjection to be <hi>Civiliter mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> as they ſpeak; that is, he is in that ſence not accounted among living men, he is one dead, becauſe he is not annimated, and acted by his own will, but by the will of him that rules him: <hi>ſo reckon ye your ſelves dead,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Make account that when you are in Chriſt, ſin is no more to be ruler, and commander, to act, and animate, and quicken you to obey its luſts, that you ſhould be acted, and animated by it, that as ſoon as ſin tempts, you ſhould obey preſently: make account in this ſence you are dead to ſin, that is, ſin is dead in you civilly, it hath not a ruling power; it comes not now as one that hath power to ſway all before it: that is it the Apoſtle ſaith in this Chapter, <hi>ſin ſhall not have dominion;</hi> You have a new Maſter, a new Lord, you are no more under the rule and dominion of ſin, that is the ſecond.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 Natural.</note> there is a natural death, as well as a judicial, and civil death, ſo things are ſaid to be dead naturally, two wayes,
<list>
                     <label>Imperfectly,</label>
                     <item>Inchoate.</item>

                     <item>Conſummate.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:47453:220"/>Natural death imperfect,
<note place="margin">1 Imperfect.</note> and but begun is this, as when there is a great blow gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with an axe to the root of a tree, whereupon certainly it will wither, and die, and be made altogether unfruitful for the time to come: though for the preſent it have leaves upon it, and though for the preſent all the fruit that is on it be not quite ſhook off, yet now the tree is ſaid to be dead, becauſe there is a blow given at the root, whereupon it will wither and certainly die. So a man is ſaid to be dead, when he hath a deadly wound given him, though he be not now dead; though he may ſtir, and live after, and perhaps do ſome hurt to him that wounded him; yet he is dead, becauſe he is irrecoverably wounded, every one that looks on him will ſay he is dead. So as ſoon as a man is in Chriſt, by vertue of his union with Chriſt, there is ſuch a blow given to the root of ſin; not in the judgment only, but in the affections alſo; ſo as it never recovers its ſtrength again, to bring forth fruit in that abundance as before; and it alway withers, and decayes more and more, till it be quite remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Now,
<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as it is in this caſe with a tree; will you know when it is dead? take it in the Spring. All the trees in Winter ſeem to be dead, but come in the Spring, and in Summer, and then if a man ſee there are no leaves, if he ſee no fruit upon the tree, now he concludes it is dead indeed: becauſe it brings not forth fruit in the ſeaſon of fruit. So, take a man, when there is an occaſion, an opportunity, to turn to folly; when upon deliberation and judgment, he may conſider of that opportunity to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage it for the ſervice of ſin, it will appear now if he be dead, he will not in ſuch an occaſion yeeld, but at ſuch a time eſpecially reſiſt ſin, at ſuch a time he will not bring forth the fruit of ſin.</p>
               <p>Look what the Spring is to the tree, that is occaſion to the ſinfulneſs of mans heart. Indeed when ſin takes a man upon diſadvantage, upon unequal terms, that he deliberates not, and conſiders not what he is doing: as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſaid in my haſt;</hi> then many times ſin prevails, and binds him, as a theef doth the maſter of the houſe, hand and foot: yet nevertheleſs when he well weighs, and conſiders things, at ſuch a time it will appear that ſin is dead. Thus you ſee how ſitly the terms hold to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the change of a Chriſtian, his judgment is right, he condemns ſin as death, in the purpoſe and covenant of his heart whereby he is bound to God, he diſpoſeth it from its dominion and rule, that what it doth now is as a theef by ſtealth, that ſurprizeth a man in his ſleep; And it hath its deadly wound, whereupon it withers, and decayes, and at laſt in the ſight of all men, and at ſuch a time, when if there were any life it would appear, at ſuch a time it ſhall appear that ſin is dead. Thus you ſee the firſt expreſſion opened, the change from ſin by death; <hi>you are dead to ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now take the ſecond expreſſion,
<note place="margin">2 Newneſs of life expreſſed by life in three reſpects.</note> 
                  <hi>you are alive to God,</hi> that expreſſeth the ſecond part of ſanctification, that this, the quickning of a man to newneſs of life. It is with thee now, as with one that was dead, and is alive, there is ſuch a change in thee. And how is this expreſſed by life? Thus; in three reſpects this change is fitly expreſſed by life.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this,
<note place="margin">1 The principle of life.</note> you know life it conſiſts in the union of a man, with the principle of life? when there is a union between the body, and the ſoul, here is life. Now though there are bodies, and ſpirits, yet the bodies live not by thoſe ſpirits, except they be united with them: therefore when the ſoul is ſeparated from the body, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ody dies, and the man is ſaid no more to be a live: ſo here in this fence, when there is a union between the ſoul of a man, and the principle of ſpiritual life, then there is that change wrought, whence he is ſaid to be alive. Now the principle of ſpiritual life is only Chriſt; ſo you ſee here in the Text, <hi>you are alive to God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when there is a union between Chriſt and you. And how is that? It is by an influence from Chriſt into the ſoul, and that is the mighty work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, as you ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. The great work that is wrought by the Spirit in quickning a man, is the work of Faith. <hi>Now I live,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>by faith in the Son of God, that dyed for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Now when there is ſuch a union between Chriſt and a man, then he lives; there is ſuch a change in him, as there is in life. Therefore beloved, this change is not in any that profeſs the knowledge of Chriſt, and have not yet union with Chriſt. It is not <pb n="425" facs="tcp:47453:220"/>enough that a man be called a Chriſtian: it is not enough that a man proſeſs that he hopes to be ſaved by Chriſt; It is not enough that a man go on in ſome external actions as other Chriſtians do, unleſs that he doth, and that he is in any ſpiritual a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> on, it be by vertue of his union with Chriſt, that it be by life received from him by a quickning vertue flowing from him to every member, that is expreſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9. by the <hi>branches in the Vine,</hi> they are quickned by union in the Vine, cut the branches from the Vine, and they die, and wither. So it is with men; let hem be in the Lords Vineyard, yet if they be not united with this Vine Chriſt, they are but dead men, <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> Epheſ. 2.1. that is the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 The actions of life.</note> this change is expreſt by life in another reſpect: for look as in life there is not only an union with the principle of life, but beſides that, there are thoſe living actions, and operations that naturally flow from that union in every living creature: ſo in ſpiritual life, there are ſpiritual actions, and operations that flow from every man that is thus united to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As every thing is in being, ſo it is in working: take a natural man, he doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralactions, by vertue of a natural life. Take a worldly man, he doth live, (as a man may ſay) in worldly actions, by vertue of that worldly principle that is in him. So take a ſpiritual man; what is the reaſon he delights in ſpiritual things? <hi>His delight is in the Law of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>and in that Law be meditates day and night.</hi> What is the reaſon his delight is in the Saints; and the more ſpiritual any one is, the more he delights in them? the reaſon is this, becauſe he lives a ſpiritual life, therefore he doth actious agreable to that principle with which he is united; therefore by this you ſhall know it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">3 The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of life. Appetite.</note> there are certain properties in life that hold in this too, and we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance but in two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, whereſoever there is life, there is a natural appetite, and deſire after all means that may preſerve that life. Whereſoever God gives life to any creature, he gives alſo a deſire to that creature to preſerve that life it hath which is the beſt ſtate of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now, it is ſo with a Chriſtian, all his deſires are to preſerve ſpiritual life, and to increaſe it: he reſts not in what he hath, but labours to be more yet, and to do more yet, to know God more, to love God more, to ſerve God better; to live more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, more profitably among men. He delights in the actions of ſpiritual life: therefore he would ſtrengthen thoſe habits by all actions, and induſtry, and indevour. <hi>As new-born babes,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, <hi>deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> No ſooner is there life in a new-born babe, but there is a deſire to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ouriſh that life. You ſee there is a natural appetite even in the very trees, that thruſt their roots down into the ground, to draw moyſture below from the earth, by an inſtinct to preſerve that life they have in the ſtock, and in the branches. So it is in every man that hath a ſpiritual life, he puts forth with all induſtry for all ſpiritual helps, according to that ſtrength he hath for the preſervation of his ſpiritual life. That is the reaſon why they are not content, in the abundance of all outward things, when they want ſpiritual helps: and that is the reaſon that they are not ſatisfied, nor ſolace themſelves in dead, worldly, company; that is the reaſon their hearts reſt not in things below; becauſe theſe are not the food of their ſpiritual life; theſe are not the things that preſerve that life that is in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 Tropagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> as there is a deſire of the preſervation of life, ſo there is a deſire of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and transfuſion of it to others, as much as may be. So you ſee thoſe things that have but a metaphorical life (as we may ſay) that are ſaid to live by way of alluſion, and metaphor, as the fire in the coal, when it is ſaid to live in the coal, it is for this reaſon, becauſe it is apt to kindle another. It is ſo in a Chriſtian, whereſoever there is ſpiritual life, there is a deſire to communicate it with as many as it can. And this you ſee in all the ſervants of God, <hi>Philip calls Nathaniel, Joh.</hi> 1.44. when he bad gained the knowledge of Chriſt. And the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> goes to call in the City when ſhe had gained the knowledge of Chriſt. When a man himſelf is united with the principle of life, when he lives in Chriſt, he deſires that others may live in Chriſt too; and this deſire, and endeavour to gain many to Chriſt, it appears in their place, and relation. A Chriſtian maſter that lives a ſpiritual life, will labour <pb n="426" facs="tcp:47453:221"/>that his ſervants under him may live the life of grace with him too. A Chriſtian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will labour that his children may live to God, as well as himſelf: a Husband will labour to draw his Wife to Chriſt as himſelf is drawn; and every one, father and friend, and acquaintance, as much as in them lies, by any advantage and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that is put into their hands, they will draw others to Chriſt becauſe there is life in them.</p>
               <p>And this is not done out of faction, out of a deſire to make their party ſtrong, as many in the world deſire to ſtrengthen their party: but as in living things there is a natural deſire to convey that life to others. Parents begat not children out of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to increaſe the party, but out of a natural affection to convey the natural life they have to others: ſo Chriſtians, that they do is out of ſpiritual affection, out of ſimple have to the ſalvation of others: out of a naturalneſs in their diſpoſition, to indeavour that all may be like them. As the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth, that all that heard him were like him except thoſe bonds; So much for that: you ſee how fitly the Apoſtle uſeth theſe terms of life, and death, to expreſs the change of one that is in Chriſt, when he turns from ſin to God.</p>
               <p>Now we come to ſee the order wherein the Apoſtle expreſſeth them,
<note place="margin">The order,</note> 
                  <hi>make account of this,</hi> conclude of this, that you were dead, but are alive. Firſt, you were dead to ſin, and then alive to God. Theſe certainly are knit together, but they are done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: ſo we joyn both theſe points in one, and that is thus much; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>All that are in Chriſt,
 he works in them by his ſpirit in this order, they firſt die to ſin; and after live to God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſervat.</hi> Men firſt die to ſin, and then live to God.</note>

               <p>Theſe two are inſeparable, but yet they are joyned in order, that firſt men die to ſin, and ſecondly live to God. The Scripture expreſſeth this in fit ſimilitudes. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.22, 24. faith the Apoſtle there, <hi>Seeing you have put off the old man, that is corrupt through deceivable luſts, and put on the new man, that after God is created in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and true holineſs:</hi> Here is the order, there is not only an effectual change, but this is wrought in a method, firſt putting off, and then putting on. He ſeems to allude to apparel there, that as a man that is cloathed with rags, he puts not on ornaments, and robes, till he have put off his rags, as it is <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. when <hi>Jehoſhua</hi> came before the Angel of the Lord with filchy garments, with vile ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, faith the Lord, take away thoſe rags, and put upon him change of rayment. Juſt thus God deals in the converſion of a man, in the change of a man that is in Chriſt, he takes away his filthy rags firſt, his love to ſin, he is no more cloathed with them as he was wont; he accounts them not or naments as they were wont to do, but filthy clouts, to which he faith, <hi>Get ye hence;</hi> he deteſts them, and then he is clothed with rayment, then he expreſſeth the fruit of holineſs and righteouſneſs. Another expreſſion there is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Ye were darkneſs, but now ye are light in the Lord, walk as children of light.</hi> There is not only a change of apparel; that is, from rags to robes, but of your ſtate and condition: you were in darkneſs, now ye are light. Mark the order, from darkneſs to light. That look as it was in the Creation, firſt darkneſs covered the face of the deep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. all was without form, and void, and then God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light:</hi> ſo now, firſt there is a removing of the darkneſs the ſoul was held in, and now ye are light in the Lord: ſo they come to walk as children of light. Well, this is the expreſſion of it in Scripture: let us ſee the ground of it in reaſon. It muſt be ſo that in this order God proceeds in this effectual change: firſt to turn men from ſin, and then to GOD; firſt to die to ſin, and then to live to God.</p>
               <p>The firſt reaſon ſhall be taken from our union with Chriſt;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. From our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt.</note> 
                  <hi>We are planted into Chriſt,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. By being planted with Chriſt, there grows a ſimilitude between Chriſt and us. <hi>We are baptized, and buried by baptiſme,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>into his death; and we are raiſed and quickned,</hi> faith he, <hi>by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt:</hi> that like as it was with Chriſt, ſo it is with us; He was dead, and raiſed, ſo we are firſt dead to ſin, and then alive to God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 From the cot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ariety of them.</note> it muſt be ſo from the nature of contraries, for theſe two things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one to another: there is an immediate oppoſition between them, ſo as there <pb n="427" facs="tcp:47453:221"/>muſt be a removing of the one, if there be a poſſeſſion of the other; and there muſt be firſt a removing of the one, before the other can be in the ſoul. As you ſee in ſickneſs, and in health; there muſt firſt be a removing of ſickneſs, before the body be in a right ſtate of health. And as in life and death, this is the order; they are brought firſt from death to life, and then one neceſſarily followes the other: as life neceſſarily followes upon the removal of death, and health, upon the removal of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it muſt be ſo; or elſe if both theſe were not, and in this order wrought: what difficulty were there in the life of a Chriſtian? what ſingular thing were there in a Chriſtian, above any man in the world? Every man in the World doth outward actions; if there were not ſuch a change as from death to life, there were no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all, where were the difficulty? The Scripture ſaith, <hi>The way is narrow and ſtrait that leads to life, and few there be that find it:</hi> what narrowneſs or ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were there in the way to life? if there were no more but thus, that a man might ſettle upon ſome actions of Religion, and ſo be effectually changed? If this were all, what great matter were there in Religion? what need <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſtand out in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? what need he be but half perſwaded to be a Chriſtian? he might eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to be a Chriſtian, if he might hold his Heatheniſme, and be a chriſtian too. What need <hi>Foelex</hi> tremble, to hear <hi>Paul</hi> diſpute of righteouſneſs and judgment to come, if he might be unrighteous, and a Chriſtian too? What need the young man be ſorry, when Chriſt bad him ſell all and follow him; if he might hold all he had, and be worldly affected, and be a Chriſtian too? what need any of the labours of a Chriſtian? to what uſe were a power of godlineſs, ſpoken of in Scripture? What powerful matter were there in Religion, if a man might hold his ſins, and yet be a Chriſtian, and a beleever, and be in Chriſt too? a drunkard, and yet be ſaved? a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner of the Sabbath, and yet be in Chriſt? what great matter were there? it were nothing to be a Chriſtian; nay who would not be one? What need Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expoſe himſelf to ſuch watchings, and faſtings, and ſufferings, if he might have gone on in the way of the World, and yet be in Chriſt too? No beloved, it is another-gates matter to be a Chriſtian, then for a man to hold his old cuſtomes, and wayes, and courſes, and yet hope to be ſaved too. Let no man deceive himſelf with this, the matter of Chriſtianity, it is a laborious work, Religion is a very ſerious thing. A man that indeed will be Religious, he muſt follow Chriſts rule; firſt deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow him: what need a man deny himſelf, if he might hold his ſins, and yet follow Chriſt? Well know this, the ground is clear, there muſt be a turning from ſin, as wel as a turning to God, if a man have union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Conviction.</note> with a word of application; Firſt, if it be ſo, It ſerves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us this day in the preſence of God, the multidude of us now before the Lord to hear the Word, and profeſs our union with Chriſt, and yet there is no ſuch matter. If we were united with Chriſt, there would be living to God, by vertue of that union with Chriſt. It is living to God in the courſe of our life, that gives us comfort of our union with Chriſt. Deceive not your ſelves, we may ſay of many, as the Lord ſaith of <hi>Sardis, Thou haſt a name to live, but art dead.</hi> There are abundance that have a name to live, but are dead: A man wonld wonder at it, that we ſhould ſay to a Congregation of ſo many people; that there were few alive among them all: that the moſt whoſe eyes are now upon the Miniſter, and whoſe eares are open to the Word; yet they are but dead, they are not alive, though they walk, and though they ſpeak and do the actions of a natural life; they live naturally, but are dead ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, they have a name to live, but are dead.</p>
               <p>The Lord tells <hi>Jeremy, Jerem.</hi> 5. That there was ſuch want of good men in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> that he might go up and down the Stteets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not find a man. A man would wonder that the Lord ſhould uſe ſuch an expreſſion; He might have ſaid, he ſhould not find a good man, a juſt man, a godly man; but not find a man ſaith he, as if he were not worthy the name of a man in the Streets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that was not appliable and conformable to Gods will. That a man ſhould go in the Streets of <hi>London,</hi> and not find a man; that he ſhould go into <hi>Moore-fields</hi> on the Sabbath day, and ſee a multidude of dead Ghoſts walking there; that he ſhould <pb n="428" facs="tcp:47453:222"/>go in the Streets, and ſee a multitude of dead perſons ſitting at their doors: that he ſhould go up and down to the houſes of men, and ſee a multitude of dead crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures talk of worldly things on the Lords day: a man would wonder he ſhould find ſo many dead men, eating, and drinking, and talking, and walking, and yet dead ſtill. The Text makes it clear here, If we be not dead unto ſin, we are not alive to God; there is no being alive to God, except a man be firſt dead to ſin.</p>
               <p>Shall we come to the trial? Beloved, there we ſhall find among the many of you that hear the Word, many are dead in ſin. What means the prophanation of the Sabbath? what means the great neglect of Family-duties? Come to your houſes there be not the prayers of living men there; there be not the meditations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of men that are ſpiritually alive in your Families; and ſhall we think you are alive? Come to men in their ſhops, and dealings, and ſee them dead in their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and covetouſneſs; and ſhall we ſay they are alive to God? Alas beloved, go to the particulars of mens lives, you ſhall hear them ſpeak the words of dead men, ſpiritually dead; in ſwearing, and curſing, and reviling, and blaſpheming, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs; and yet ſhall we ſay that they are alive? Look upon all the actions of men, it were an endleſs work; where we find dead works, we conclude there is a dead man: when men do the things that are the actions of a man ſpiritually dead, we conclude they are ſpiritually dead; the Holy Ghoſt ſaith ſo, <hi>for they are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> therefore now let us come a little cloſer. There are abundance that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves that they are alive; therefore a little try your life, by your death to ſin.</p>
               <p>What are your opinions, and judgments, concerning your own wayes? thoſe things that the Word of God condemns for evil: thoſe things that out of the Word are preached to you daily by way of reproof of ſin; that are ſpoken to you by Chriſtian friends, by way of admonition to bring you out of your ſins, how do you take them, and digeſt them? are they pleaſing to you, becauſe they tend to the killing of ſin? or are they diſtaſteful, becauſe they give you not reſt in your ſins? What; do you judge ſin worthy to live, and your ſelves not dead the while? It is a note of a man that is alive in ſin, that hates reproof; that hates him <hi>that reproveth in the gate;</hi> he that hates him that reproves his ill works, he is not dead to ſin, for he doth not judge his ſin worthy to die.</p>
               <p>Again, come to your aſſections, what is it you delight in? When a man looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thing that is dead, if it be indeed dead; the ſight of it is terrible, and gaſtly, and troubleſome to him. When <hi>Sara</hi> was dead, though <hi>Abraham</hi> loved her dear in her life, <hi>remove my dead out of my ſight?</hi> If ſin in thee be as a dead thing, how doſt thou look upon it? doſt thou look upon it as a thing that thou art afraid of? as a thing that thou art the worſe when thou ſeeſt it. When the objects and occaſion of ſin are preſented to you, how ſtand you affected then? all that are dead in ſin, take thought to fulfil the luſts of the fleſh, as the Apoſtle ſaith, they delight in it, ſin is ſweet to them, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith: but if on the otherſide you look on it with indignation, loathing, and deteſting, and abhorring ſin, and your ſelves for ſin; then it is a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſign of your death to ſin.</p>
               <p>Again, when you do look on it, do you look upon it as a ruler, or as an enemy? for there is a great deal of difference. A theif was come into the houſe, as well as the maſter of the houſe; but they come not with the like authority, nor with the like acceptance: the thief comes, but you know all the houſe ſets againſt him, and never reſt till they caſt him out; and if they want ſtrength, they cry for help: but the Maſter of the houſe comes in, and then all the ſervants are in their places to do him ſervice, all take care to pleaſe him, and give him content. How entertain you the motions of ſin? look upon your former wayes, upon your former cuſtomes, and vanities; look upon your wonted courſe of ill, and conſider now whether there be an endeavour to ſatisfie the ſinful inclination of your hearts? or is there a ſtriving, and uſing all means to be rid of it? Do you make this your queſtion to the Miniſters you converſe with, to the Chriſtian friends with whom you conſult in this caſe, how to be rid of ſuch a corruption, how to get ſuch a ſin purged out? Is this the matter of your prayer to God: do you cry to Heaven for help, to get out this theif, that is <pb n="429" facs="tcp:47453:222"/>ſtollen into your hearts, this traytor that conſpires againſt the glory of God, this rebel, that maintains a fight againſt the kingdom of Chriſt, do you ſo look on it? It is a ſign you are dead to ſin, or elſe ſin is alive in you, and you are dead in ſin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and laſtly, conſider your actions, conſider your converſation; doth ſin get ſtrength, or is it weakened? For know that this is not the mortification of ſin, that a man be never troubled with it more, that he never hear more of it, that he be never more troubled with the motions of ſin, no? As a man that hath a deadly wound given him, it may be he more fiercely ſets on him that gave him the deadly blow, then ever before; yet he falls dead at his feet after, ſo it is with the motions of ſin: think not when ſin is dead, by vertue of our union with Chriſt, that we ſhall not be tempted any more to ſin, that you ſhall not have ſin any more in you: no, it will be in you, and moleſt you; But what fruit do you bring forth? What actions do you? what ſtrength hath ſin? all the ſtrife it hath, is but to diſquiet, and diſturb you, not to rule and command you as it was wont to do. It is a ſign that ſin is dead naturally, by way of incoation, it will die in the end, you ſhall hear no more of it at the laſt: and though it a great while diſturb you, and diſquiet you; yet this is your comfort you are diſturbed, and you maintaine Gods quarrel againſt your corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fight againſt it: it is a ſign it hath a deadly blow. Therefore let every one conſider his eſtare, let no man deny himſelf his own portion: let him that is dead in ſin, know that he is dead, and the wretchedneſs of that condition, eternal death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in that death. And let him that is dead to ſin, know that he is alive to God, and is among thoſe that live in Chriſt, and ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>A word of exhortation,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Exhortation.</note> and ſo I conclude. Doth this teſtifie our life in Chriſt, that we are dead to ſin? Then as you hope for any comfort, or priviledge, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by Chriſt; labour to make this good to your ſouls, and labour to ſecure this evidence more and more, that you are dead to ſin. There are none that hears me this day, but they profeſs they hope to be ſaved by Chriſt, and they look for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name under Heaven to be ſaved by, but the name of Jeſus. It is certain, but who will Chriſt ſave? they are ſuch as whom he ſanctiſies; and will he ſanctiſie ſuch as by union with him are dead to ſin, and alive to God? Then I beſeech you make this good to your ſelves, ſtrive more, and more to kill ſin; take this as a quickning argument, that you are in Chriſt, and therefore you muſt be conformable to Chriſt. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>He bore our ſins in his body on the Tree,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>that we might be dead to ſin, and live to righteouſneſs:</hi> Why did Chriſt bear your ſins in his body upon the Tree? but for this very end; that as he died for ſin, you might die to ſin. Now that we may perſwade you,
<note place="margin">No loſs in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſin.</note> know that it is upon ſpecial ground, you loſe nothing, but get much by it; the more you die to ſin, the leſs you loſe by it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Not life.</note> you ſhall not loſe any thing that is comfortable, and good, you ſhall not loſe life by it; nay indeed the more you ſin, the more you die; every ſin is deadly and mortal, every ſin tends to your deſtruction, to the taking away of life, this is certain. Therefore look as a man when he is in a mortal dangerous diſeaſe, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man concludes, if the diſeaſe prevail he will die; nay, it hath ſo far prevailed, that it will be the death of him: you need no more to perſwade him to ſpend all his eſtate upon Phyſitians to cure that diſeaſe. Now the ſins that you cannot endure ſhould be reproved, that you cannot abide to reform; they will be death in the end, your eternal death, therefore labour eſpecially againſt them: When we diſwade you from ſin, and perſwade you to purge outſin, we perſwade you to your cure, to be free from your diſeaſe, to be free from that that will end in death.</p>
               <p>You ſhall not loſe any reſt and peace by it:
<note place="margin">2 Not peace.</note> the more you mortiſie ſin, the more reſt and peace you ſhall have; nay, the more ſin rules, the leſs reſt and peace, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked:</hi> but they are as the troubled waves of the Sea, that alway foam, and caſt up mire and dirt, as the Prophet ſpeaks, ſuch is the reſtleſs agitation of a man that goes on in ſin, he is ever reſtleſs, and unquiet. Would you have peace, and quiet? get out ſin that hinders all peace and quiet.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">3 Not eſteem.</note> you ſhall not loſe outward good things, not credit, and name, and eſteem. Nay, what diſhonours you, and expoſeth you to reproach, and ſhame, and obliquie, <pb n="430" facs="tcp:47453:223"/>is it not ſin? For, what is it that men are evil ſpoken of, is it not for this, and that particular evil? Do you love your name? avoid ſin, ſin will end in ſhame, it is the iſſue, the fruit of it. God will give you honour with his ſervants, nay, even in the hearts of the wicked. You know the more men ſtrive to mortifie their ſins, the more the world reproacheth them ordinarily: but we muſt not judge what men do in their jollity and in their paſſion; but what themſelves do, when they are upon the wrack of a trouhled conſcience, upon their death-bed, oh then if they <hi>might die the death of the righteous,</hi> oh then they would they had lived the life of the righteous, or any thing then, if they had been like ſuch a one whom they ſcorned. This gained eſteem of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Herods</hi> heart.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">4 Not wealth</note> you ſhall not loſe your wealth, your eſtate: all loſſes of eſtate that are judgments, and puniſhments, they are but the fruits of ſin, you ſhall keep your eſtate, and keep it with comfort, as far as it is good for you, your ſins provoke God, even to curſe your bleſſings.</p>
               <p>You ſhall not loſe your pleaſure if you part with ſin;
<note place="margin">5 Not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</note> nay, you ſhall gain plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. All ſorrow, and grief of heart, and diſquiet of ſpirit, that ariſeth from terrour of conſcience, are they not hence, becauſe of ſin? Would you have joy, and pleaſure unſpeakable, and glorious? part from ſin, that is the cauſe of ſorrow. When we bid you part with ſin, we ſpeak to you to part with a needleſs thing, it is a ſuperfluity, as well as hurtful, ſuperfluity of malice, what need one ſin in the world? cannot you live,
<note place="margin">Sin a needleſs thing.</note> and be happy without it? cannot you live comfortably, and die bleſſedly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin? Nay, is it not that that hinders your bleſſedneſs and happineſs? The Angels in heaven they are bleſſed, becauſe they are without ſin: but thoſe of them that ſinned, they are <hi>reſerved in chains of darkneſs, to the judgnent of the great day. Adam</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, in the ſtate of innocencie; he was bleſſed, he was without ſin: but as ſoon as he ſinned, he was caſt out of Paradiſe; and a Cherubin ſet with a flaming ſword, to keep the way of the Tree of life, that man ſhould not come at it. You your ſelves, the beſt comfort, the beſt peace, the beſt evidences you have, are thoſe that do ariſe from your hatred of ſin. Therefore do but conſider how needleſs a thing it is. Can you get any thing by it? can you live a day longer, or an hour more happy? can you be a whit better by it? If you could enjoy any preſent good by ſin, there were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be pleaded: but what is it? you get a little wealth by unrighteouſneſs, is it gain? <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, their belly ſhall be filled with gravel. If a man ſill his belly with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, what hath he gotten by it? you will get that that you muſt caſt up again: you get that that one day you will wiſh you had never known: as Iſrael when they turned to God, they ſhould ſay of their garments of ſilver and gold, that they had made for their Idols, <hi>Get you hence.</hi> So every worldly man that raiſeth his eſtate by unrighteous means, the time will come that he ſhall wiſh all the money that he hath gotten were in the bottome of the Sea, that he had never known what a penny, or a houſe, or apparel had meant, that he hath gotten, or made, or appropriate to himſelf by any unrighteouſneſs whatſoever. What Uſe is there of it? And will you loſe your ſouls for that that is nothing? and will you loſe heaven for that that is needleſs? and eternal happineſs for that that will not do you a moment of time, not a little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good, not a little preſent eaſe, not a little preſent comfort?</p>
               <p>But laſtly,
<note place="margin">2 The gain by death to ſin.</note> the great benefit that redounds by it, that is ſpoken of in the Text, it is that you ſhall live, and <hi>live to God.</hi> The more you die to ſin, the more you ſhall live to God through Jeſus Chriſt. Now we come upon a ſtrong motive to perſwade you to ſet more heartily againſt thoſe evils that are daily reproved, the more you die to them, the more you ſhall live to God. Suppoſe the work of repentance be a hard task, ſuppoſe it ſhould be ſomewhat painful; ſuppoſe it be ſomething that vex and diſquiet the natural ſpirit of man: as there is pain in repentance, and mortification of ſin, yet nevertheleſs if you may get eternal life by it, is it not worth the while? Conſider what you do for natural life, ſuppoſe a member of the body be gangrened; that it is in danger to be ſpread over the whole body, and the taking away of natural life, the loſs of a hand, and the loſs of any member, though it be never ſo uſeful, rather then the body ſhall be in danger, and a man deprived of life, you will loſe a uſeful member: and when you have done, you do it but in hope to preſerve life: for you <pb n="431" facs="tcp:47453:223"/>are not ſure when you have cut off that member to live a day after: but yet becauſe it is poſſible, becauſe it is the way to natural life: and yet if you have that life gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſuppoſe for term of years, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had for fifteen years, yet it is but a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life, a life full of miſery, a life expoſed to many vexations and diſquiets, a life that hath ſo many troubles in it, that men in the beſt eſtate of health with ſometimes that they were dead, through diſquiets, and troubles, and yet for the preſervation of a troubleſome life, if you were ſure of that, you would loſe a member. I know when we come, and ſpeak of renouncing your former wayes, your cove ouſneſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, and pride, and vanity, and wickedneſs in any kind, we ſpeak of cutting off of hands, of members of the body, they are ſo dear: therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If thy hand off end thee cut it off; if thine eye off end thee pull it out;</hi> it is better to go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with one hand, then to hell with both. This I ſay, I know you apprehend it a hard leſſon, there is no life, no Chriſt, without ſuch a death to ſin. Yet it is a truth, and a neceſſary truth for you to know, and therefore conſider it, and that ſeriouſly what you loſe. If we come and perſwade you to cut off ſome uſeful member, yet you yeeld to that for a natural life: you wil cut off a hand that is as uſeful as any member of the body: but we bid you cut off ſuperfluous members, thoſe needleſs members, the members of ſin that will be your death. We would have you but to be rid of the Ulcer, that is all we would have you deprived of, to preſerve ſpiritual life, and to live to God. If I were to ſpeak for a natural life, it were but temporal, it were but upon conjecture: but we ſpeak for a life upon certainty, When we perſwade you to die to ſin, that you may live to God; we aſſure you that this will certainly follow on it, you ſhall live to God, if ſin die in you, and we ſpeak not only upon certainty, but for eternity too, you ſhall do it for eternity too, you ſhall do it for eternity: it is not a life that ends. Nay, we ſpeak for a life wherein there is true happineſs, that hath no mixture of miſery to make you weary, but a life that hath perfect peace and joy: a life that hath bleſſedneſs begun, and ſhall have bleſſedneſs perfected in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: this life we perſwade you to live.</p>
               <p>Conſider now what we ſay, if there were more, you ſhall live to God the more you die to ſin, <hi>Skin for skin</hi> (faith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>and all that a man hath he will give for his life:</hi> but if it be ſuch a life as this, to live to God, a ſpiritual life; what? to live as the Angels do, that live with God! to live as the Saints in Heaven, that live in the fruition and ſight of God, wherein they are bleſſed! ſuch a life we perſwade you to.</p>
               <p>A life infinitely above this, if this life had all the contentment the earth could give it, it were not worthy to be compared, though a man might live a thouſand years in the confluence and abundance of all proſperity, it were not to be compared with one moment of the happineſs of the ſpiritual life that we ſhall life in for all eternity with Chriſt. Now conſider, take things, and compare them together; here is ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſin that I was given to, to pride, to covetouſneſs, to prophaneneſs, to wickedneſs of this fort or of that fort, if I go on in it, I die eternally, I loſe God, and heaven, and my ſoul, and happineſs: what ſhall I get by this when I have done it? I gratifie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, I deſtroy my ſoul, I have loſt my ſelf and am undone for ever. And what a madneſs is this for a man to venture the eternal ruin and deſtruction of himſelf, and that for a thing of nothing, for that that will make him miſerable now, and more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eternally.</p>
               <p>Conſider, and know to whom I ſpeak, I ſpeak to you that have heard the Word, and many times received the Sacrament. What did you when you received the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? was it not a pledge to you of your intereſt in Chriſt, and of your union with him? and that Chriſt is as truly united with you, as that you eat and drank? Now let it appear, make you account, whatſoever you were before, make you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, reckon ye, go not by gueſs and ſay, I hope it will be better with me then it hath been; no, but reckon, conclude, made account, I muſt be another man, I may not be what I was, I muſt leave thoſe things that are ill; I muſt apply my ſelfe to another courſe; Indeed I walked in a way of enmity to the wayes of God, in eſtraingement from God, in worldly wicked wayes, but it muſt not now be ſo, I muſt make account now that Chriſt is mine, I am now dead to ſin, and therefore dead to ſin, that I may <pb n="432" facs="tcp:47453:224"/>live to God: if there be any life of grace in me, it will appear by my death to ſin. I muſt make account of this, I muſt do this; and this is the beſt way of making a right uſe of the Sacrament. Why are men as bad after the Sacrament as before? becauſe they reckon not, they make not account for themſelves, that they are dead to ſin. Make account you have received life from Chriſt, and you muſt act that life; and now ſet your ſelves to it, reaſon with your own hearts, why do I thus, and thus? As <hi>Ezra</hi> reaſons, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Lord ſince thou haſt kept us from being beneath for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhould we ſin more?</hi> So conſider, hath the Lord kept me from hel, and admitted me to his Table, where he hath ſpoken peace to me, he hath ſpoken reconciliation in Chriſt, ſhall I return to ſin againſt him? certainly he will be more angry now then ever he was before: the ſins that I commit now, will be greater then all the ſins I have committed hitherto; for now I ſin againſt more grace, and againſt greater mercy: for God hath again renewed the Covenant of peace, whereas he might have caſt me off for my former breach, and ſhall I provoke him again? hath the Lord waſhed me, and ſhall I defile my ſelf again? God forbid. Reaſon with your ſelves, I muſt not be as I was: it is not for me to do as others that know not God, and that are not in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, or as I was wont to do before; I know what it is to bind my ſelf in covenant, to receive the Sacrament, I muſt be in another faſhion, and courſe of life, then ever I have been. Therefore when temptations come to ſin: for you muſt not think to be rid of all motions, and temptations to ſin: and whenſoever there comes new temptations, not to conclude you have received the Sacrament in vain, ſay not ſo, but rather ſay, now comes the tryal; this is that whereby God will try what fruit comes, of the coſt and pains, and mercies he hath beſtowed on me; here is a meſſenger ſent for fruit, If I can withſtand the commands of ſin, and reſiſt the motions, and look on it as a hateful thing, I make it manifeſt that I am indeed dead to ſin, as the Scripture ſaith here, reckon that you are dead to ſin.</p>
               <p>Therefore as when a man is delivered from being a Galley-ſlave under the Turks, and his ranſome is paid: if his old Maſter come, and command him to the Galleyes: he ſaith no, my ranſome is paid, I am free, and I will not any more be a ſlave. So reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thou art no more to be ſuch as thou wert wont to be: for now reckon your ſelves ſaith the Apoſtle, if you be in Chriſt, <hi>that you are dead to ſin, and alive to God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Will not detain you with the Argument of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nor in the Coherence of this Scripture. The ſcope of it (in a word) is thus much. <hi>If in this life,</hi> in this World, <hi>onely,</hi> for the preſent, <hi>we have hope</hi> and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and the aim of our confidence, and the height of our hope reach no further, then <hi>we, we</hi> poor Chriſtians; <hi>we</hi> the faithful in the World, <hi>we are of all men moſt miſerable;</hi> yea, we are more miſerable than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other men.</p>
               <p>The words contain in them two parts of a <hi>Hypotheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Propoſition; of which the firſt is an <hi>Antecedent</hi> (as we call it,) and the other is the <hi>Conſequent.</hi> You may call the firſt, <hi>a Condition,</hi> and the laſt, <hi>a Concluſion.</hi> The <hi>Antecedent</hi> or <hi>Condition,</hi> is this; <hi>If in this life onely we have hope in Chriſt;</hi> What then? then the <hi>Conſequent</hi> or <hi>Concluſion</hi> is this; then <hi>are we of all men the moſt miſerable.</hi> But now againſt the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> there ariſeth this <hi>Aſſumption</hi> to make up the ſence, to make it perfect; <hi>But not in this life onely have we hope in</hi> 
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:47453:225"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> (for that is the meaning of the Apoſtle,) therefore againſt the <hi>Conſequent</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth this <hi>Concluſion: Therefore we are not of all men the moſt miſerable,</hi> nay, we are not miſerable at all.</p>
               <p>You ſee here are terms in the Text of great conſequence; here is <hi>life,</hi> here is <hi>hope,</hi> here is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> here is <hi>men,</hi> here is <hi>miſery,</hi> and here is all things almoſt that can be ſaid, either concerning Heaven, or earth. Now mark, it is not ſaid, If in this life we have hope, we are miſerable; neither, if we have hope in Chriſt in this life then are we miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; not ſo: but <hi>if our hope be onely in this life,</hi> and ſtick there, and go no further then ſo, <hi>then we are miſerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two Emphatical terms in the Text we muſt take notice of, and that is onely in the former part, and moſt of all in the latter part: only in the former part, that ſtraitneth, and reſtratheth our <hi>hope;</hi> moſt of all in the latter part, that inlargeth our miſery: and ſo it may well, for when the <hi>hope</hi> is reſtrained to the preſent, there the miſery may be infinitely inlarged. But not for the preſent is our hope; only for the preſent, <hi>ergo,</hi> &amp;c. I need ſay no more, it is the Text.</p>
               <p>I ſhall raiſe to you ſix ſeveral Conſectaries, or Corrollaries, or Concluſions, that naturally ariſe out of this Scripture; and I purpoſe at this time to run them all through; it muſt be roundly, it ſhall be plainly; do you hear patiently.</p>
               <p>The firſt Aſſertion we make out of the Text, it is this; that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The faithful are hopeful.</hi> The godly have hope; <hi>we have hope,</hi> that is taken for granted.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, concerneth <hi>the object</hi> of this hope; and the Point is this; that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt is the object of the Chriſtians hope. We have hope in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third, is touching <hi>the time</hi> of our hope, and that is for this life; the Leſſon is this; that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The life-time, it our hope-time. We have hope in this life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is; that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hope in this life, it is not onely of the things of this life.</hi> Not only of this life; <hi>for if in this life only we have hope:</hi> oh no, take that away, our <hi>hope in this life,</hi> is not onely ſet upon the things of this life. <hi>If in this life onely;</hi> not ſo.</p>
               <p>Fiſtly, this life, you ſee how that ſtandeth convertible with another term in the Text, with miſery; ſhewing thus much; that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This life is miſerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt is; that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The faithful, the hopeful, they are not of all the moſt miſerable, they are not miſerable at all. Then were we miſerable,</hi> but the former being not true, that cannot be true. Theſe are the ſix Points.</p>
               <p>Of which, to content my ſelf with a touch of them as I paſs along, and ſo onely to preſent them ſeverally unto you, I begin with the firſt; that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The faithful, they are hopeful.</hi>
               </p>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </note>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have hope,</hi> ſo are the words; <hi>Faith is the evidence of things hoped for,</hi> ſo ſaith the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">The faithful are hopeful. Rom. 5:</note> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. And <hi>they that have acceſs through this Grace, they rejoyce in hope of the glory of God:</hi> they go joyned together.</p>
               <p>Hope is <hi>a conſtant expectation of the performance of ſuch promiſes of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Definition of Hope:</note> 
                  <hi>as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend out of his Word, by faith.</hi> For example.</p>
               <p>Faith, doth beleeve Gods promiſes to be true; Hope, doth expect the performance of them according to that truth.</p>
               <p>By Faith, we beleeve God to be our Father; by Hope, we expect that he ſhould ſhew himſelf ſuch a one to us.</p>
               <p>By Faith, we do beleeve eternal life; by Hope, we attend when this life ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. <hi>Spe,</hi> (as one ſpeaks) what is it elſe, but <hi>perſever antia ſidei,</hi> the perſeverance of Faith. Faith is the Mother, Hope is the Daughter; the Mother is iucouraged and comforted by the daughter, as <hi>Naomi</hi> was by <hi>Ruth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pets</hi> 1:9.</note> that the holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> he aſcribeth the ſalvation of our ſouls to our faith;
<note place="margin">Rom: 8:24,</note> ſaying, that <hi>the end of our faith, is the ſalvation of our ſouls:</hi> Well and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he aſſureth the ſame to belong unto Hope; ſaying, <hi>we are ſaved by Hope.</hi> So then, Faith ſaith, I beleeve theſe bleſſed promiſes of God to be <pb n="435" facs="tcp:47453:225"/>true; and Hope faith, I ſee them, and I wait for the enjoyment of thoſe things that are reſerved for me: Thus Faith, and Hope, are woven one in another: Thus <hi>the faithful, are the hopeful: We have Hope.</hi> That's the firſt Point.</p>
               <p>The Uſe of this Point briefly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
                  </note> it ſhall be but this; Firſt, to teach us to ſeek and to find out this Hope in our ſelves. And ſecondly to ſtrive and to fight againſt ſome impediments that oppoſe themſelves, and are hindrances of this Hope.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 Trial of Hope:</note> thou muſt go and ſeek thy ſelf, and ſearch out and find, whether thou haſt this Hope in thee, yea, or no: and thou muſt be ſure, that thou beeſt ſo far from being a deſperate paſt-hope,
<note place="margin">Rom: 4:18:</note> like <hi>Cain;</hi> that rather thou <hi>beleeve,</hi> and hope <hi>above hope,</hi> with <hi>Abraham;</hi> not preſumiug, but beleeving as he did.</p>
               <p>Now then, how a man may know whether he have this Hope in him or no; I think he may find it out thus, in few words.</p>
               <p>There are divers temptations, and eſpecially three of a mans faith; (not to enlar ge my ſelf further) in every of which, Hope if it come in and play its part, then it doth appear to be preſent, to be there. As for example.</p>
               <p>The firſt temptation, that is a kind of battery againſt the ſtrong hold of a mans faith; it is the <hi>prorogation of Gods promiſes;</hi> He is pleaſed to put them off longer, and to diſpoſe of them many times other waies then we look for: Hereupon, we that are weak in Faith, we ſtumble at it; and we would haſten them on apace, though we know what the Prophet ſaith,
<note place="margin">Iſa: 21:16:</note> 
                  <hi>He that beleeveth maketh not haſt:</hi> But we are ſuch faithleſs perſons, that we haſten on too much, and would have God to come apace to make good his promiſes. Now when God defers theſe promiſes, if a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in with his hope, and faith,
<note place="margin">Hab: 2:3:</note> 
                  <hi>The viſion is yet for an appointed time, though it tarry,
<note place="margin">Iſa: 8:17:</note> wait; for that that ſhall come, will come, and he will not tarry:</hi> and <hi>though the Lord doth hide himſelf,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet: 3:9:</note> (as it is in the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah) yet he will return again</hi> If Hope will prompt Faith, and tell it <hi>that the Lord is not ſlack as ſome count ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but he will make ſure his promiſe in the end; then this is a manifeſt ſign to a man that hath his faith thus ſupported, that Hope is preſent there. Here is then one ſearch of it.</p>
               <p>Another time, there is another temptation that betideth a faithful man; and that comes to paſs, by <hi>Gods appearing</hi> in a manner <hi>an enemy,</hi> by viſiting him in his ſoul, by wounding his conſcience, by ſetting him in a kind of ſight of Hell, when he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed in ſpirit;
<note place="margin">Pſal:73:9</note> as if God were now come out <hi>as a man of War</hi> againſt him, and would not have mercy upon him. Now if Hope can come in and ſay, that <hi>God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forget to be gracious, nor cannot ſhut up his loving kindneſs in diſpleaſure;</hi> and therefore I will endure, and I will ſtay on the Lord, for <hi>He will appear,</hi> and <hi>He will have mercy upon Zion;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal:102:13.</note> I, <hi>when the time, the appointed time cometh.</hi> I will ſtay this time. If I ſay, Hope thus perſwadeth the faithful man of this goodneſs of God that ſhall be revealed to him, here is a manifeſt ſign, Hope is preſent.</p>
               <p>There is a third temptation that Faith meets withall, and that is concerning <hi>the mockings of men in the World,</hi> when they deride the profeſſion of Chriſtians and faithful men;
<note place="margin">2 Pet: 3:3.</note> and will ſay as thoſe profane and profuſe fellows in the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Peter, Where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> it is ſo long ſince his promiſe was made,
<note place="margin">Iob: 2:9.</note> and yet there is none of his coming, <hi>Wilt thou ſtill retain thine integrity?</hi> (right <hi>Jobs</hi> Wife, as ſhe ſpeaks to him) wilt thou ſtill retain thy truſt? to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is it?
<note place="margin">Mal: 3:14:</note> 
                  <hi>It is in vain to ſerve the Lord,</hi> (as thoſe wicked ones ſpeak in <hi>Malachy.</hi>) Now if Hope will come in and ſay,
<note place="margin">2 Cor: 6:8:</note> notwithſtanding all theſe things, yet <hi>paſs by bad report,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam: 6:22:</note> 
                  <hi>and good report;</hi> be of <hi>Davids</hi> mind, <hi>I will yet be more vile before the Lord, that choſe me before thee and thy fathers houſe;</hi> and I will ſtand it out, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the mockings of men. Here is a manifeſt ſign that there is Hope.</p>
               <p>Thus you may ſeek to find this grace in your ſelves; and you ſhall find it by many ſuch kind of aſſaults, as theſe which Faith meeteth withall.</p>
               <p>Now as you are to find it,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2.</note> ſo you are to fight againſt the hindrances of this Hope. And the hindrances of a mans hope, are ſometimes <hi>ſlaviſh fear;</hi> ſometimes <hi>an impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpirit,</hi> and ſometimes even <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf, and that is a tedious affront indeed that Hope meeteth withall.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Fear,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hindrances of hope:</note> a kind of paſſion and perturbation of the ſpirit of a man, that makes his <pb n="436" facs="tcp:47453:226"/>
grief begin,
<note place="margin">1 Iohn 4.18. Rev: 21: 8.</note> before his affliction comes upon him: this ſame <hi>Fear hath</hi> a great deal of <hi>painfulneſs</hi> in it. Where <hi>the fearful are,</hi> they are ſhut our with the unfaithful; and <hi>without ſhall be dogs,</hi> with thoſe that are ſubject to this fearfulneſs. Now Hope cometh to a man and faith, Though I ſometime be afraid, yet put I my truſt in God, and therefore <hi>I will not fear what man can do unto me,</hi> I will not be danted with any kind of ſlaviſh terrour. Hold out thou that faiſt thou haſt faith, and be not afraid of <hi>the Arrow that flies by day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal: 118: 6.</note> nor of <hi>the terrour by night.</hi> Here is the hindrance of this hope taken away.</p>
               <p>Then there is <hi>an impatient ſpirit,</hi> that many times poſſeſſeth men. An impatient ſpirit,
<note place="margin">Pſal; 91 :5.</note> and a hopeful heart, they are both as contrary as can be; You ſhall have many a man ſo touchy, that he cannot endure any delay, he muſt have things come according to his own mind, or he loſeth his patience preſently. Oh but <hi>I will pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wait for the Lord,</hi> ſaith hope. And here is the oppoſition that muſt be made for the maintenance of this hope againſt all kind of impatiency:
<note place="margin">Pſal: 40: 1.</note> 
                  <hi>In patience poſſeſſe your ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt hindrance,
<note place="margin">Luke: 21: 19.1 Cor: 15: 16</note> is <hi>death. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death.</hi> We have many enemies in this world, <hi>our</hi> very <hi>life is a warfare,</hi> but amongſt all the figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and combates we meet with in the world, there is none comparable to this laſt ſingle combate we muſt undergo with death it ſelf; this is a terrible aſſault that beti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the hopeful, faithful man; to know that notwithſtanding all his faith, and all his hope, and all his love, and all his patience, what grace or vertue ſoever he hath elſe,
<note place="margin">Iob 17: 13:</note> yet not withſtanding he muſt go <hi>down to the grave, make his bed in the darkneſs,</hi> and lie down in the duſt; and when he hath fought all that he can, yet not withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he muſt down, he muſt yeeld, he muſt take the foyl, the fall in the body howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the ſoul eſcapeth. Now here is a kind of diſmaidment of hope. But I will tell you how it is ſpoken of the faithful,
<note place="margin">Heb 11: 27:</note> and ſo of the hopeful. The faithful are ſaid to <hi>endure as ſeeing him that is inviſible:</hi> how do they endure? by the ſupply of hope: for this hope is it that makes the faithful againſt all hindrances to fight it out, ſo as that <hi>they would not be delivered,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb 11: 35:</note> as it is ſpoken in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews.</p>
               <p>And ſhall death ſeparate us from that we hope for? No faith the hopeful man, it ſhall not. Yea, ſo far he is from being unwilling to ſubmit himſelf to this way, as knowing it to be the way whereby he cometh to that he hopeth for, as that he is very ready, and greedy of death: it is the way to that I hope for, ſaith he: therefore it is ſweely ſpoken of an Ancient,
<note place="margin">Phil: 1: 23:</note> and you will acknowledge it to be a ſweet ſentence of that Father Saint <hi>Auſtin, He that deſireth to be diſſolved</hi> (according to that of the Apoſtle) <hi>and to be with Chriſt. Non patienter moritur, He doth not die patiently.</hi> See, here is a faithful, a hopeful man, and yet doth not die patiently: what would <hi>the Father</hi> ſay? <hi>He liveth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>patiently,</hi> the very life he liveth putteth him to his patience; when he cometh to die, <hi>he dyeth pleaſantly;</hi> he goeth away with his hope, and his hope is full of immortality.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 62.3.</note> he fleeth to theſe as the means, not to reſt in them, to make it the main of his aim, the ſcope of his hope, he doth not fly thus to them, but he goeth to God that commandeth all, that worketh above all, againſt all and without all means, and ſanctifieth all theſe means: Therefore well ſaith the poor man, God is my help, and the ſick man, God is my health; and the weak man, God is my ſtrength; and the blind man, Chriſt is my light; and even the dead man, the diſtreſt man, God is my life, and the good man, Chriſt is my Hope, and the happy man, Chriſt is my love.

               <p>The contemplation of theſe two points ſhould teach Chriſtians, a Chriſtian feduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to kindle, to keep that grace that is in them; and it ſhould kill carnal ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Chriſtian ſedulity, a care, a ſtrife, an induſtry, an endevour to be Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,

               <p n="2">2. It ſerveth on the other ſide to kill that carnal ſecurity that is in men. It is a ſtrange thing to conceive, that Chriſtians are grown to ſuch ſecurity as they are, that they ſhould be ſo ſupine and negligent in their ſervices: I ſay it is a lamentable caſe; and I doe wonder the more, that they ſhould be taken with this kind of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, when I conſider that ſaying of a Father, that there is ſecurity in no place: there is no ſecurity in heaven, nor in Paradiſe, much leſs in the world; in heaven the Angels fell; in Paradiſe <hi>Adam</hi> fell; in the world <hi>Judas</hi> fell; <hi>Judas,</hi> I he fell from the in ſtitution of the beſt School, and School-maſter that ever was in the world; there is no <pb n="439" facs="tcp:47453:227"/>manner of teacher comparable to him. Therefore I ſay, mix with thy hope a certain fear, and be ſo far from a carnal preſumption, as that thou maintain in thy ſelf a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear of falling, for it hath ſo come to paſs, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> indeed was, what he was not, of a perſecutor he became an Apoſtle; hope lies there away: but <hi>Judas</hi> was what he did not appear to be, and of an Apoſtle became an Apoſtate; fear lies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away. And thou that hopeſt that of a perſecutor, thou maiſt turn an Apoſtle; fear leſt by falling away, thou maiſt of an Apoſtle become an Apoſtate, a perſecutor. I will not ſtand upon theſe things any longer.</p>
               <p>I have paſſed three, the fourth Concluſion is; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>Hope in this life is not only for the things of this life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4. <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Hope is no: for the things of this life.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If in this life only we have hope, then are we miſerable;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, if in this life only, for the preſent, we had hope, and that the end of all our hope, and al our deſire, were fixed upon the preſent world, then were we poor Chriſtians moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: for none in the world are more deſpiſed, contemned, ſcorned; none more afflicted, troubled, grieved in their ſouls for their ſins then they; alwayes followed with outward ſights, with inward frights, when other men enjoy the world at will: ſo that the ſcope of this Scripture is to ſay, that not for this life only have we hope in Chriſt; that is the very meaning; that the godly, the faithful, the hopeful, they have not their portion in this life; <hi>We know when this earthly tabernacle is diſſolved, we have a building made with God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>a houſe not made with hands, eternal in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, whoſe builder and maker is the Lord;</hi> ſo ſpeaks the Apoſtle to the Corinths.</p>
               <p>As for this life, if we ſhould lay the foundation of our hope here; alas, they might rue their miſerable caſe that ſo do; they might hang down their heads, that are godly, with ſhame and grief enough to themſelves, but it is here they ſet up their hope, here they have hope, but it is hope here for another life; it is upon other things that their hope is fixed then are here below; it is for things that they look for, it is not for things that they ſee, for <hi>hope that ſeeth is no more hope, but if we with patience waite for the things that are not ſeen, this is hope,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>So that this is a very plain caſe, and might be further cleared, and declared to us from the practice, and common opinion of all the Saints of God in all Ages, how they have hoped, and how that their hope was in God; that they ſhould <hi>ſee the Lord,</hi> but where? <hi>in the Land of the Living:</hi> here they have a ſight too, but the chiefeſt hope is on the Promiſe, and that is not for the things of this life only, but for the life to come;
<note place="margin">Iſa: 57.13.</note> 
                  <hi>He that putteth his truſt in me ſhall poſſeſs the land, and ſhall inherit my holy mountain;</hi> their hope is in the end, that is of thoſe things that they ſhall attain in the end of this life.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of this Point, that hope it is not only for the things of this life, may teach us to contend againſt death it ſelf, which is one of the ſtrongeſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt hope, as I touched before, and to contemn and deſpiſe all the things of this life.</p>
               <p>It teacheth a man to ſtrive and wreſtle
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> and contend againſt death? becauſe though a man do die, yet it ſhall not hinder his hope, it ſhall not hinder him from that he hopeth to attain. Death is the greateſt amazement a man can meet withal in the World, but what can Death do? well may it take away from a man his life, but it cannot take away from him his love; well may it take away from him the action of his hope here, it ſhall ceaſe, but it ſhall never take away from him the object of his hope, that which he hopeth for, it ſhall continue; well may it help him to it, but it can never hinder him from it; here is then comfort and courage in the very hour, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A man learneth here to contemn,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2.</note> and to deſpiſe the things of this life, ſpecially if they be ſuch manner of things as will come in compariſon with their betters, when baſer things will compare with better things: in this kind of compariſon now a mans hope ſhould take him off, and not ſo much as ſuffer him to lean to any kind of reaſoning that is made againſt his hope. Hope biddeth him not to truſt, not to look to any thing that is in this life, becauſe it doth not at all concern that which is 
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:47453:228"/>
the aym he hath. The very beſt things that be in this life, they are not worthy to be hoped for after; inſomuch, that even death it ſelf it may be counted a remedy, and not a penalty. God will have a mans life to be ſhort, and death to come ſoon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will not have his creature worn out with a tedious miſery, and tranſitory vanity; a vanity of miſery, that is in this vain miſerable life of mortality. I have done with the fourth.</p>
               <p>A fifth thing that followeth in the Text (that I may haſt on) we have <hi>Hope,</hi> we have <hi>Hope in Chriſt,</hi> we have <hi>Hope in Chriſt in this life;</hi> our hope in this life is not upon the things of this life, for <hi>if it were in this life only, it were miſerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our life is a miſery;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5. <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Our life is a miſery.</note> There is the fifth.</p>
               <p>And this is a certain truth, and it will plainly appear to us in many paſſages; if we will believe either the Spirit of God, or the experience of the godly, I ſhall not need to ſtand to proveit: You will ask me, how it will be raiſed from this place?</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>We are of all men the moſt miſerable,</hi> becauſe that we are mentioned amongſt the number of thoſe that are the more miſerable; it implieth, that all the reſt are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable more or leſs: the very compariſon that is uſed, doth manifeſtly declare unto us that there is a meaſure of miſery to every man living: ſo then there is miſery.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appeareth out of the Text, becauſe here and elſe-where, you ſhall have man and miſery made terms convertible: Man is named <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Enoch</hi> is <hi>miſery:</hi> Man, and miſery ſo joyned together, that there is no pulling them aſunder till death parts them, for then there is no more miſery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe that miſery here; our being <hi>miſerable in this life,</hi> is mentioned even with the very beſt things of this life: the very beſt things that are in this life, and of this life, ſo long as they look to this life, I ſay they are ſtiled miſerable; but the beſt things, even Chriſt himſelf, our <hi>Hope</hi> it ſelf; ſay what you can, here is <hi>Hope,</hi> and here is <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Text, and yet not withſtanding here is miſery too. Now then we reaſon thus; that if the beſt things in this life be miſerable, then the reſt are no better then ſo; that the beſt are no better, it is plain; becauſe let us have what we would have in all the World, yet ſo long as we are here it is miſery.</p>
               <p>If this be ſo, then we muſt come to the concluſion we have made, and that is <hi>Jacobs</hi> concluſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.9. <hi>Few and evil have the dayes of the years of my life been,</hi> it is <hi>Jobs</hi> concluſion too,

               <p>And yet notwithſtanding all that we can ſay, we know there are ſome perſons that will not be taken off from the Worlds breaſts, they have a better opinion of it than ſo.

Hope is in the Text the principal thing, and to lament and mourn for thoſe that are departed, we ſhould be ſo far from it, as to rejoyce in our ſpirits for the bleſſed tranſlation of ſuch into eternal reſt from this vail of miſery, I ſay we ſhould rejoyce in their very tranſlation.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I confeſſe, it is very fitting both in Civility, and Divinity, and agreeable to the lawes both of Grace, and Nature, that there ſhould be mourning, eſpecially <hi>in the houſe of mourning,</hi> at times and occaſions offered in this nature, it cannot otherwiſe be.

               <p>How prove you that?</p>
               <p>By the force of the argument here that the Apoſtle uſeth: for this being a part of an Argument, and an <hi>Hypothetical</hi> propoſition, he reaſoneth thus: <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, then are we miſerable,</hi> but now for this life onely we have not <hi>hope in Chriſt:</hi> he doth not ſet our reſt there, therefore we are not of all men the moſt miſerable.

               <p>Not <hi>the moſt?</hi> not at all. Not at all? No, for as the outward proſperity of the wicked in this World is no true proſperity, ſo the outward adverſity of the godly is no true miſery: it is not ſuch as doth deſtitute and diſſolute a man utterly, but you ſhall have the faithful come off with hope, I and with rejoycing rather then grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repining at it; yea they joy in their ſufferings, and at laſt <hi>are more then conquerours;</hi> and all this ſheweth then, that that they are far enough from miſery.</p>

                  </gap> muſt be actions. It is not ſpeaking good, nor meaning good only, but it is doing good.
<note place="margin">I am. 2.15: 16.</note> Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>If a brother be naked, or hungry, or cold, and you ſay to him, go in peace, warm thee, but you give him no fire: and go and cloath thee, but you give him no apparel: and go and feed thee, but you give him no meat.</hi> Here are good words now: but the deeds are not anſwerable; here are no good deeds at all. <hi>Solomon</hi> compares ſuch complemental charity, that is only vernal, and in outward expreſſion, to <hi>Cloudes and winds without rain.</hi> Not much unlike the boxes of <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> that are adorned with glorious titles without, but open them, and examin their in-ſides, you ſhall find nothing but emptineſs.

<note place="margin">Heb: 13:31</note> to <hi>mourn with thoſe that mourn,</hi> and to be with thoſe that are bound, as being bound with them.
<note place="margin">Rom: 12:15.</note> This is that which our Saviour called being merciful. <hi>Be merciful, as your heavenly Father is merciful.</hi>

               <p>But then thirdly, theſe actions, and theſe affections whence they riſe, they muſt hold conformitiy with the Law. There is no good, but what is conformable to the rule of goodneſs: that is the written word of God: and therefore all thoſe will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and idle ceremonies made according to the inventions of man; as a thouſand devicies in <hi>Popery</hi> (wherein they intimate a ſhow of great Liberality) they are not good deeds, becauſe they want that good rule that ſhould uphold and make them ſo.

               <p>Again, there is a third term yet. <hi>Do good to all men;</hi> What doth the Apoſtle mean, that every man ſhould receive the fruits of our <hi>Beneficence?</hi> There are ſome men notorionſly wicked, and rather to be puniſhed than relieved: The Apoſtle means not ſuch,

If there be extream neceſſity, do good to all; but if you may make choyce of perſons to whom you may do good: chooſe <hi>the houſhold of faith.</hi> Thus you have the ſubſtance, and the meaning of the words. In them you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve briefly theſe three parts.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a determination,
<note place="margin">Diviſion.</note> or limitation of time, to which the Saints are tied in the performance of the duties that are in joyned them: <hi>as you have opportunity,</hi> and while you have time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a declaration of duty, <hi>do good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is a deſcription of the perſons to whom this good muſt be done; firſt more generally: <hi>Do good to all:</hi> and then more particularly, and with an eſpecial note; <hi>Eſpecially to thoſe of the houſhold of Faith.</hi> Of theſe in order.</p>

                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. It is the duty of Chriſtians to take the beſt opportunities of their life to do good:</note>
               </p>
               <p>I will ſpeak ſomewhat by way of Explication of the point; and ſomething by way of Application, and ſo proceed to what follows.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the Explication: what is intended, or meant in it, when we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite you to embrace times and opportunities. Briefly theſe two things are meant in it.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">A twofold op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunlty to be taken of doing good:</note> that you ſhould be ſure not to loſe the time of life. And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, that you ſhould not forego the advantages, and opportunities of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</p>
               <p>You ſhall not alwayes have life to <hi>do good:</hi> and it may be (if you have life) you ſhall not alwayes enjoy means, and ability to <hi>do good.</hi> While you have life therefore, and time, <hi>do good;</hi> or while you enjoy means: and ſo power to <hi>do good:</hi> embrace theſe opportunites. That is the meaning of the Apoſtle in this place.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 The time of life:</note> then there muſt be a doing good while you have life; let your good works go before you, do things while you live, and defer not the performance of them till your death.
<note place="margin">Luke 16:9:</note> 
                  <hi>Make you friends of the unrighteous Mammon, that when you want, they may receive you into everlaſting habitations.</hi> He calls that <hi>unrighteous Mammon,</hi> not that it is unrighteouſly gotten only (though that may be meant) but that which is unrighteouſly kept, is unrighteous Mammon to you; if you procured it never ſo juſtly, unleſs you do rightly diſpoſe of it; and if you be deſirous to do right in diſpoſing of your Mammon, of your wealth, do it now; That when you want that power, and thoſe times, you may enjoy the comfortable fruit of the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redeeming <pb n="448" facs="tcp:47453:232"/>of the time of your life, to <hi>receive you into everlaſting habitations.</hi> In the 25. verſe of the 16. <hi>Luke,</hi> it is the challenge of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives; Son remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou in thy life-time haddeſt thy goods,</hi> (for ſo the word ſignifieth) thou haddeſt thy opportunities of life, and of goods too, but now thou haſt neither life nor goods left thee, to do good with; and therefore <hi>he is bleſſed and thou art tormented.</hi> It was the folly of thoſe <hi>five Virgins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 25.10.</note> they took not the opportunity of life (for that is the thing meant there) but they poſted over all to the laſt, and hoped that all might be effected in a trice or miniute of their life, which would have held them em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment enough all the dayes of their lives: And therefore they came ſhort of heaven; <hi>the gates were ſhut</hi> againſt them, as you ſee, when the <hi>Bridegroom came.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man imagine,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Objection.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them;</hi> That therefore it matters not, ſo long as a man doth good at his death, though he have neglected the wayes of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all his life.</p>
               <p>Let them know that by works there,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> is not meant the actions of men, but the fruits of their actions. <hi>Their works follow them;</hi> not the works they have deferred untill death, but the fruits of thoſe works, they did while they were living, and received not the benefit of them untill death. Their works follow them, that is the fruits of their works. It is more good and pleaſant by far, to have the actions go before, and the fruits, and comfortable effects to ſucceed, and follow after.</p>
               <p>But if any man yet ſuppoſe that he may make that up in his Will,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Objection.</hi>
                  </note> which he hath neglected, all his life long: and though he have lived miſerably, covetouſly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably, all the dayes of his life; yet his thoughts may tell him, that by the <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Requeſts of his laſt Teſtament;</hi> as bequeathing largely to the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and to all ſorts of people, be may at the laſt make fit compenſation and ſatisfaction, for neglect of former duties.</p>
               <p>Let no man deceive himſelf with ſuch a bad reſolution,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> for firſt it argues a ſign of infidelity, that a man will not truſt God, for fear he ſhould want in his life-time; what is the reaſon elſe that he defers the doing good in health, unleſs it be for fear of wanting himſelf? ſuch diſtruſt he hath in the providence of God. Beſides, the ſame God which bids thee do good when thou haſt opportunity, and while thou enjoyeſt the advantage of life, he expects it now. And it may be truly ſaid of many that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thoſe times of doing good while they lived, and have now ſupplyed that defect in their death, by the large benevolence of their Wills; <hi>Their will is good, but their deed is naught.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for the firſt point, I proceed unto the ſecond; that is, thou muſt not only take the time of thy life,
<note place="margin">2 Of outward eſtates.</note> but alſo the opportunity of thy means, and thy eſtate; while there is yet <hi>a price in thine hand:</hi> while thou haſt opportunity, and enjoyeſt wealth to do good with: redeem the advantages and opportunities by employing them in that way, for which thou didſt receive them. The time may come wherein you may deſire to do good, but cannot; wanting an eſtate, and opportunities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to do it.
<note place="margin">Trov: 23.5.</note> Mark what <hi>Solomon</hi> faith, <hi>Wilt thou truſt in a thing of nothing? for Riches have wings as an Eagle, and fly away toward heaven.</hi> It is the vanity of men, that they ſtill forbear, and ſtay, while their eſtates increaſe; pretending that then they ſhall be better able to do good, and extend themſelves more largely: or that they may keep their wealth, and wait for a better opportunity. But <hi>why with thou truſt in a thing of nothing?</hi> Thou ſeeſt a fowl in her flight, and now (it may be) thou perceiveſt it, but inſtantly it vaniſheth out of thy ſight. Why <hi>riches have wings</hi> (faith <hi>Solomon.</hi>) Thou haſt them now in thy poſſeſſion, and retaineſt them faſt in hold,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ: 11: 8.</note> but preſently they are departed; they fly as an <hi>Eagle</hi> out of thy ſight. And the ſame wiſe man when he exhorteth men to <hi>caſt their bread upon the waters;</hi> He gives them this reaſon: <hi>Thou knoweſt not what evils;</hi> thou knoweſt not what judgments and calamities God intends to bring upon that Nation where thou liveſt, upon the City, upon the Family where thou dwelleſt; upon thy perſon or eſtate: <hi>Thou knoweſt not what evils,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim: 6: 17.</note> 
                  <hi>God will bring upon the earth.</hi> And ſo likewiſe, <hi>charge rich men in this world, that they be not high-minded; and that they truſt not in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain riches, but in the living God; that they be ready to diſtribute, and to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, <pb n="449" facs="tcp:47453:232"/>and to do good works.</hi> What is it that hinders men from diſtributing, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating? Becauſe <hi>they truſt in uncertain Riches.</hi> For if they would now learn not to <hi>truſt in uncertain Riches,</hi> but account them uncertain as they are; and put confidence in the living God, who can provide for them, when thoſe outward means (which they ſo much rely on) fail their expectations, they would then be more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and bountiful, and ready to do good, and to communicate. So then here is the meaning of the point.</p>
               <p>Take the opportunities of life. That is, firſt take the time of life, while you may do good; and then take the means, the wealth, and eſtate, which is the time of your means.
<note place="margin">Iob 13: 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> For this obſerve <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, he goes on diſcourſing of this very point, he was now a man ſtript of all he had, but the other day the Richeſt man in the Eaſt; the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Caldeans</hi> had carried away his goods, his cattel, and his children, and all things were taken from him. Yet there was one thing that adminiſtred comfort, in the day of his adverſity and his affliction; And it was this, faith he; <hi>If I have made the eyes of the poor to fail; or if I eat my morſels alone; or if I have not relieved the fatherleſs,</hi> &amp;c. If I have not done thus and thus; then let the Lords fierceſt judgment fall upon me; But herein conſiſts my comfort, my conſcience bears me witneſs, that when I had wealth, and eſtate, and enjoyed the goods of this life, I did good. I was <hi>father to the fatherleſs; a foot to the lame, and eyes to the blind,</hi> I did all the good that lay within the compaſs of my power to do, when I had means to do it. I ſay, little do you know (beloved) whatſoever thou art, whatſoever eſtate thou haſt, though thou be as a nail faſtned in a ſure place, and thinkeſt thou ſhalt never be moved from this condition: Thou knoweſt not how ſoon God may turn his hand upon thee, when thou maiſt be as <hi>Job</hi> was on the dunghil deprived of all comforts. What will be thy conſolation then? that when thou hadſt wealth, thou didſt good with it. It will add to thy affliction, that thou hadſt great poſſeſſions, and didſt neither glorifie God, nor do good to men. So much for the opening of the point; I come to apply it.</p>
               <p>Firſt then,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> it ſerves for the reproof of many to whom God hath given the <hi>price in their hands:</hi> But <hi>they want hearts</hi> to embrace the opportunities of doing good. They pretend to do good, and have a mind inclining to good: But they have no heart to take the opportunities, and advantages of times, and means, which God hath beſtowed on them for the ſame purpoſe;
<note place="margin">Prov: 3: 28:</note> they want hearts to embrace thoſe. Remember what <hi>Solomon</hi> faith: <hi>Say not to thy neighbour, go, and come again to morrow, If it be now in thine hands to give him.</hi> The Lord will not only have a man not deny to do good, but beſides that, he would not have him delay to do good; put him not from thee till to morrow, if his help remain in thine hands to day; yea, though thou have a purpoſe to do it to morrow; if it be in thy power to day, do it; and defer it not till to morrow.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall we ſay to thoſe, who do not only delay their purpoſes, but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting loſe their purpoſes. There is nothing more ordinary, then in ſome caſes for men: not only to purpoſe truly, but to promiſe heartily to God, that they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form theſe, and theſe acts of mercy, if God will deliver them from ſuch fears and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as they (at ſuch times) are incompaſt with. A man that endures extremity of weather, in a tempeſtuous Sea, if happily he may attain the land in ſafety: a man that is diſeaſed with ſickneſs, if now he may recover his health again, or one that ſuffers impriſonment, if he may procure his liberty: or a man that is in fear of the loſs of his eſtate,
<note place="margin">Pſal: 78.</note> by the means of ſome unhappy caſualty; if now he may eſcape that loſs: he will beſtow a great deal on God, and on the ſervants of God; nay, he promiſes, and vows unto God in his extremity. But how many of thoſe promiſes, as well as thoſe other purpoſes, come to nothing? they have liberty, they receive health; they enjoy ſafety, and have the full fruition of all their deſires: but alas, how ſhort come their vows of performance? not one of many of them, but turns God away without his bargain. Remember how the Lord taxeth the people of Iſrael; <hi>In the day of their diſtreſs</hi> (and the Lord reckons up divers and ſundry troubles they were in) then they ſpeak good words to God: they would cleave to him, and promiſed to do thus and thus. But (thus faith the Text) <hi>They flattered the Lord with their lips,</hi> 
                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:47453:233"/>and were falſe in the Covenant with God. Is it not it ſo (beloved) with many of us? Oh that your hearts might ſmite you this day, before the Lord, for many pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and promiſes that you have made of doing this or that, for the glorifying of God, and the diſcharge of your duty! One man hath promiſed reſtitution of unjuſt gain: another, to become more liberal, and bountiful toward others. And the Lord hath waited week after week, moneth after moneth, and year after year; and yet nevertheleſs you continue the ſame men, either unſenſible, or careleſs to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh your promiſe to God, or rendring unto him his due. That is the firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2.</note> let it ſtir up every one of us to a care of his duty of embracing opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. And when we perſwade you to take opportunities, we would draw you a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree higher: not only to take them, but to ſeek them; for how ſhall a man obtain the advantage of taking opportunities, if he firſt ſeek them not? and therefore we perſwade you to that. We ſee <hi>Abraham ſitting in the door of his Tent,</hi> that he might obſerve opportunities of doing good; he ſtayed not till the men knocked at his door for reliefe,
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> but took notice of their paſſing by, that he might call them. We ſee a good old man in <hi>Judges</hi> 19. As he perceives a ſtranger paſſing the ſtreets, firſt takes occaſion to queſtion his wants, and forbears not till the man complain; ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was he to adminiſter to his neceſſities, and to embrace a fit opportunity of doing him good. We ſee <hi>David</hi> expreſſing his thankfulneſs to God, and to <hi>Jonathan. He enquires if there were any of the houſe of Saul, that he might ſhew him kindneſs for Jonathans ſake.</hi> So ſhould we do. Is there any of <hi>the houſhold of Faith</hi> (as the Text faith,
<note place="margin">2 Sam: 9.1.</note> and as the Scripture calls them) unto whom I may ſhew kindneſs for the Lords ſake? He hath been better to us then <hi>Jonathan</hi> was to <hi>David,</hi> and yet we are much more backward to Retribution, and expreſſions of thankfulneſs then <hi>David</hi> was to <hi>Jonathan.</hi> But the Scriptures are plentiful in this, we need not ſtand on it; I ſay this is a duty, that every one ſhould diſcharge this task: not to ſtay and forbear till the reports of mens wants are brought to them, but to be circumſpect and ſeek for all accaſions that may deſerve the extent of their goodneſs. If you live in a Pariſh wherein (happily) there remains not many poor, yet you live in a City, there are many there; if there be not many in the City; you live in a Country, in a Kingdom, doubtleſs where there are many; if there be none there, yet thou haſt further means to extend thy charity: Thou liveſt in a Church, is there any member of the Church in all the World diſperſed in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> in any place of the earth where the poor abide? enquire after them, that you may know their wants, and relieve their neceſſities.</p>
               <p>I come now to the ſecond, from the determination of time, to the declaration of duty, while we have time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us do good.</hi>
                  <lb/>
I told you what this goodneſs is, in the intent of the Apoſtle in this place. Doing good is a releeving thoſe that are in neceſſity, for that is the Apoſtles meaning, as we may ſee in the context and coherence of theſe words with the former; So then the main Point is no more but this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is the duty of Gods ſervants</hi> (as to make advantage of their times ſo) <hi>to employ themſelves in releeving of others.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> 2. It is the duty of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to relieve others.</note> Take it more brieſly. <hi>It is a doing good, to releeve others,</hi> that is the duty of Gods ſervants; and it well becomes them, to be employed in this work, while we have time on earth and means to do it, to employ our ſelves in doing good, and relieving others. And there is familiar appearance of this in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by reaſons alſo.</p>
               <p>By Scripture it is commanded in precept, and commended in practiſe of the Saints. <hi>If any of thy brethren among thee be poor</hi> (faith God) <hi>thou ſhalt not harden thy heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut 15.7:</note> 
                  <hi>thou ſhalt not ſhut up thy hand againſt thy poor brother.</hi> The not opening of the hands to relieve him, God accounts that, as proceeding from the hardneſs of the heart. <hi>Thou ſhalt not harden thy heart againſt thy brother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Caſt thy bread upon the Waters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.4. Iſa. 58.7:</note> 
                  <hi>for after many dayes thou ſhalt find it. Is not this the faſt that I have choſen, for a man to give his bread to the hungry; and that a man ſhould releaſe thoſe that <pb n="451" facs="tcp:47453:233"/>are in Captivity,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8:9.</note> and to let the oppreſſed go free?</hi> The Apoſtle wiſheth that as they abounded in knowledge, and in vertue, and in faith, and goodneſs; ſo they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound alſo in this Grace of God. The Grace of God that he there ſpeaks of, is the willing readineſs to the doing of good. <hi>To do good, and to diſtribute forget not; for with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb: 13: 16.</note> You ſee thereby doing good, he means di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution: the latter word doth prove the former, and both explain this Text.</p>
               <p>You have it likewiſe commended in the practice of the Saints. I need not be large in diſcourſing to you the carriage of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> the practice of <hi>Cornelius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 15: 19.</note> yea of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe. The Scripture is plentiful in this, I and that which is more to be obſerved, that although Chriſt himſelfe were relieved by others; yet out of that he gave a ſhare to the poor.</p>
               <p>It wil appear likewiſe in reaſon, that this is a neceſſary duty, and theſe may be taken.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1.</note> from the equity of it; for it is equal you ſhould thus employ your time and eſtate, and thoſe advantages of life which God hath made you doner of, partly to that purpoſe; and a man commits an injury in neglecting theſe holy duties: and is not only become an unmerciful, but an unjuſt man, and ſo in the plaineſt phraſe a diſhoneſt man: he is not juſt that doth not thus. Therefore, <hi>with-hold not the good from the owner thereof,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro: 3: 26: 27.</note> (faith God) <hi>when it is in thy power to give.</hi> The poor is owner of the eſtate of the rich ſo farr as his neceſſity requires it; and it proves but a matter of juſtice and equity, to beſtow his riches where it ought to be beſtowed: and a man is unjuſt in that reſpect if he do it not.
<note place="margin">Luke 16: 9.</note> Riches are called <hi>unrighteous mammon</hi> (as hath been expreſſed before) when they are unrighteouſly with-held from them to whom they ſhould be given, as well as when they are unrighteouſly gotten. So that detaining it from thoſe unto whom it is appointed by Gods direction, converts that riches (perchance honeſtly procured) into the mammon of unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.</note> as it becomes a matter of juſtice, ſo it proves likewiſe a matter of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: a man makes wiſe proviſion for the preſent, and the future alſo by this courſe, And therefore it makes way for the felicity of the ſervants of God, to employ their endeavours in the execution of this duty, and to lay faſt hold on the forehead of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it proves a conſequent of wiſedome for themſelves in procuring their own good. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that judgeth wiſely of the poor,</hi> why ſo? <hi>The Lord will conſider him in the day of evil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal: 41: 1.</note> 
                  <hi>and he will not give him over to the will of his enemies,</hi> What is the thing that a man is moſt ſubject to fear in this World? but that which <hi>David</hi> faith concerning <hi>Saul: I ſhal fall ſometime or other by the hands of ſome enemy,</hi> of ſome miſchievous perſon, or malicious perſon or other. You ſee the Lord hath here promiſed a large aſſurance of ſafety and protection from the malice of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries in the day of evil,
<note place="margin">Tſal: 37: 6.</note> if he wiſely conſider the poor. Again it makes much for the good of his poſterity. <hi>The good man is merciful,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and his ſeed inherits the bleſſing.</hi> It may be he perceives not ſuch ſenſible and apparant fruits, or outward ſucceſs in his own life upon this courſe, yet his ſeed inherits the bleſſing: and the leſs he enjoyes, the more ſhall they receive of Gods goodneſs towards them, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for his benevolent kindneſs towards the people of God. And what great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er legacy can man beſtow upon his poſterity then to leave them (by his particular means) in the loving favour of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>And as it is ſo for the preſent,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6: 19.</note> ſo it becomes a courſe of wiſedome for the future al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. <hi>Charge the rich men of the World that they be ready to do good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>laying up a good foundation for the time to come.</hi> And by this means a man may provide well for eternity. <hi>Make you friends</hi> (faith Chriſt) <hi>of your unrighteous Mammon, that when you fail, they may receive you into everlaſting habitations.</hi> The way for a man to provide for eternal good, is to uſe his talent of wealth and eſtate (for the preſent) to the good of many. Thus we ſee the Reaſons plainly verified: to make uſe of it briefly and haſten to that which remains.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo then,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
                  </note> that it is writ down to be the duty of Gods ſervants to mannage the opportunities of this life for this end, and in this courſe of doing good; that is, of diſtribution and reliefe.</p>
               <p>Then it ſerves to reprove thoſe that neglect this duty, and account it not a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <pb n="452" facs="tcp:47453:234"/>of their life; only they conceive of it as a matter of praiſe and commendations, a thing that they do well in performing, and not very ill in omitting. They conceive it to be of no abſolute neceſſity, but voluntary charity, as a matter arbitrary, but not as a duty neceſſary, and for this cauſe they appear but ſlack and indifferent; they conceive this as a duty to lay up wealth, but never remember the neceſſity of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out wealth to be commanded for a greater duty then the former: they take it for their duty to get all they can, but forget the following precept, to do all the good with that they get, as they can. And here is the reaſon why there are ſuch laviſh expences beſtowed upon every vanity, that the portion of the poor, and ſuch as ought to be relieved with our eſtates in point of equity; and by vertue of Gods Commandment is ſwallowed up by every vanity. It is ſpent in exceſſive apparel, for the ſatisfaction of the vain faſhion-monger: in ſuperfluity of dyet for the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and the Epicure: in Haukes, and Hounds, and Dogs, to pleaſe the humour of the voluptuous perſon: it is conſumed in raiſing up vain and unneceſſary Buildings by earth-worms, that make their habitations below, and lay a foundation for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on earth; neglecting that goodly building given of God, to the re-ediſying of their ſouls in the kingdome of Grace. And thus is the portion of the poor conſumed, and themſelves (for want of the ſame) expoſed to all the miſery that this World can inflict. Some cry they cannot do it, we have not an eſtate to undergo it; in the mean time they run to exceſſe of Riot, and make ſuch voluptuous and ſuperfluous feaſts, that the <hi>Phenix</hi> hardly eſcapes the bounds of their deſires. If you can be thus exceſſive in your dyet, in your apparel, in your ſports; if you can caſt away in preſents, and in gifts, in bribes, and in gratuities, ſuperfluouſly upon rich friends: there muſt (of neceſſity) be a defect in your will to the command of God, when you neglect the miſerable condition of the poor, and lend no hand to help them. What is the reaſon of it? but becauſe of the natural rebellion and Athiſme that is in the heart of every man againſt God; that they will employ their eſtates any way, rather then beſtow them to that purpoſe for which they are appointed by God. Oh what account ſhall ſuch be able to make at the day of Judgment; do but ſuppoſe <hi>when the Books ſhall</hi> come <hi>to be opened,</hi> wherein the particulars, <hi>Diaries</hi> and paſſages of your life ſhall be thus examined: <hi>Item,</hi> ſo much for a feaſt; <hi>Item,</hi> on ſuch a day, for ſuch another great feaſt; and many a hundred dayes, for as many hundred feaſts, wherein hundreds of the ſervants of God have endured extream want, and inforced into baniſhment into other places, to perſecution, to miſery and diſtreſs, when thou couldeſt not find one of them in a corner of thy purſe. <hi>Item,</hi> ſo much for ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, for ſuch entertainment, for ſuch building of Walks and Galleries; What no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the ſervants of God? are they ſo empty, when your houſes appear ſo full? live they ſo poor, and you ſo richly glad? what can you ſpare nothing for Chriſt, and the diſtreſſed members of the Church all this while? Oh my beloved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what <hi>James</hi> faith;

               </p>
               <p>But how ſhall a man in ſuch actions of mercy,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How to give ſo as to do good: <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Give juſtly</note> and bounty, and liberality, make it appear <hi>that he doth good?</hi> Therefore briefly, take ſome helps in this.</p>
               <p>A man that will contribute out of his eſtate to releeve others, and intends to do good. Firſt, he muſt do what he doth juſtly, he muſt not out of mercy extended to one, injure another, but muſt alwayes level his charity by his own ability. And this is that which the holy Ghoſt calls, the giving of a mans own. <hi>Caſt [thy] bread upon the waters:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 11.1.</note> 
                  <hi>thy</hi> own bread, not another mans. To give that which is a mans own by right, by lawful procuring; his own by right of poſſeſſion, the gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed out of that, makes acceptation before God, and provides a double recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence <pb n="453" facs="tcp:47453:234"/>for the giver. You ſee how <hi>Zachens</hi> gives; <hi>If I have wronged any man, I will reſtore it, and half my goods I give to the poor.</hi> That is, I will firſt make reſtitution of what I have unjuſtly gotten, and then of the remainder, I will give half to the poor.</p>
               <p>It is no giving for a man, to employ all his life-time in the procurement of unjuſt gain: By Uſury, deceit in trading, and other indirect and forbidden courſes, to heap up abundance of <hi>red clay;</hi> and then to ſum up a large Bill of the particular goods he intends to Religion; for Churches, and for Hoſpitals, and the poor, with other ſuch like benevolences, makes but a ſimple ſatisfaction for thy unjuſt courſes, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing ſuch wealth to the prejudice, and detriment of others: this is nothing to thy advantage; all this while thou art a thief, and giveſt ſtoln goods. Nay, thou maiſt further aſſure thy ſelf, that Hell ſhall be the greateſt recompence of thy charity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou beſtoweſt that which is not thine. Thou oughteſt firſt to have made thy eſtate clear, and have reſtored the things that belonged unto others, and reſerved thine own by it ſelf, and then to give free ſcope to thy charity to the doing of any good action, which time and occaſion could propound. This is the firſt duty of any man that will do good in giving, he muſt give juſtly.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 Give wiſely Pſal: 1: 2:</note> he muſt give wiſely too, it is made the marke of a man fearing God; <hi>He conſiders wiſely of the poor, and he orders his affairs with judgment.</hi> What is that? Judgment hath a twofold reſpect; it hath reſpect to the quantity of a mans gift; and to the quality of the perſon to whom he gives.</p>
               <p>There muſt be a judgment,
<note place="margin">In reſpect of the quantity:</note> a wiſe ordering of things in reſpect of the quantity which a man beſtowes, according to that expreſſion of the holy Ghoſt, in <hi>Acts</hi> 11.29. <hi>They gave according to their abilities,</hi> they kept within the limits of their eſtates, and exceeded not. So muſt thou, or elſe another man may (perchance) loſe by thy liberality.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">In reſpect of the quality:</note> there muſt be reſpect had to the quality of the perſon to whom he gives; <hi>My goodneſs extends to the Saints that are on earth, to the faithful ones;</hi> as the Text faith here, <hi>to the houſhold of faith.</hi> It is not neceſſary to give to every one that comes next to hand. There be ſome perſons, I told you before, that are not to be releeved, except in caſe of extream neceſſity. We muſt extend our Benevolence to thoſe of the houſhold of Faith. Give unto Chriſt, and to the naked and hungry members, that belong unto him, and thou ſhalt not want a ſweet and comfortable return of thy cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">3 Give in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity: Rom: 11: 8:</note> as it muſt be done juſtly and wiſely, ſo (if we deſire to do good in releev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) we muſt do it ſimply. In the ſimplicity and plainneſs of our hearts; <hi>Let him that diſtributes, do it in ſimplicity,</hi> faith the Apoſtle. What is that ſimplicity? when a man looks up to God with a ſingle eye (as the eye may be ſaid to be ſingle, when it viewes but one object at once ſo) the heart is ſmall when it reſpects God onely in this action of charity, and makes no other reckoning of any outward object. A double-minded man he looks up to God, and yet carries ſome reſpect to the outward honour which he expects of the World; and more (often times) to the World then to God, at leaſt he joynes them together. But if a man be deſirous to beſtow his benevolence with a purpoſe to receive recompence from above, let him do it for his ſake that commands it, and reflect upon God in all things. <hi>This is the teſtimony of our Conſcience</hi> (faith the Apoſtle) <hi>that in ſimplicity and ſincerity we have had our converſation among you:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat: 6:</note> not affecting the praiſe of men, but aiming <hi>to approve our ſelves to God</hi> in that we do. This is that which Chriſt adviſed the Phariſees, that they ſhould not admit <hi>their right hand to know what their left hand did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">4 Cive chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: 2 Gor: 8.6:</note> as it muſt be ſimple, ſo it muſt be chearful: <hi>God loves a chearful giver.</hi> And this is a perfect ſign of chearfulneſs, when a man doth not only give without grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon all opportunities: but when he will be careful to prevent them in his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to ſeek them, as I ſaid before. So much for the ſecond point, the duty it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now I proceed to the laſt thing;
<note place="margin">The perſons to whom good muſt be done:</note> that is, the deſcription of the perſons to whom this muſt be done. Firſt generally: <hi>All,</hi> and then particularly, <hi>The houſhold of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt generally: <hi>Do good to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:47453:235"/>It is as I have told you,
<note place="margin">1 Generally to all:</note> to all that endure ſuch wants and neceſſities, as that it may be a work of mercy, and no tranſgreſſion of the rule to releeve them: for thoſe that live unprofitably, and become burthens to the Common-wealth (except in caſe of extream neceſſity) it loſes the name of mercy to relieve them,
<note place="margin">Luke 10:</note> and deſerves neither reward nor commendations. Yet, if they live in extream neceſſity, then take the Rule of the Apoſtle; <hi>Do good to all,</hi> even to them alſo. We have the Parable of our Saviour to direct us in this path, where the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> lends his aſſiſtance to the <hi>Jew</hi> that fell among theeves: We cannot but know of the oppoſition and enmity, between the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and the <hi>Jewes:</hi> yet we ſee that in caſe of extremity, the <hi>Samaritan</hi> helps the <hi>Jew.</hi> Therein our Saviour teacheth us, that every man (in this caſe) is a mans neighbour, and therefore the ſame law that commands, <hi>to love thy neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> intends we ſhould do good to all, if neceſſity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is,

                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1.</note> in regard there is the ſame maker of one, as of another; <hi>We have all one Father</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) and <hi>hath not one God created us?</hi>

               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.</note> there dwels a part of Gods Image in all man-kind, and that reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance makes us alied to each other by the bonds of Nature:

               <p>To make ſome uſe briefly of this.
<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> Is it ſo, that doing of good is to be extended to all when neceſſity requires it: Then let it teach us (without all evaſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of thoſe duties commanded) to embrace every object and occaſion that may invite us to do good, and to be merciful.</p>
               <p>But ſome man may reply in this faſhion,
<note place="margin">Object.</note> my intent is very plyable: that away of goodneſs, I could willingly extend it toward ſuch a man; but he is a ſtranger unto me, and one with whom I was never acquainted.</p>
               <p>What is this,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> but the churliſh reply of <hi>Nabal</hi> to the ſervants of <hi>David?</hi> there are divers men abroad whom I know not; <hi>there are</hi> ſome <hi>ſervants that are run from their maſters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam: 25:</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall I give my bread and that I have provided for my ſhearers</hi> unto them? <hi>Nabal was his name, and folly was with him. Abigai!</hi> did truly interpret his nature to be anſwerable to his name, which ſignified a man of folly; for if his conditions had been otherwiſe, he would not have ſent them empty to their Maſter, knowing their abſolute neceſſity, in which caſe a ſtranger ought to be relieved, and we cannot thruſt him back from our charity.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Object.</note> ſuch a one (I confeſs) is not a ſtranger, but an enemy; and when it lay in his power, he procur'd me all the miſchiefe he could, and ſhould I now relieve him?</p>
               <p>Mark the rule of the Apoſtle;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Rom 12:</note> 
                  <hi>If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he be naked, cloath him; if he thirſt, give him drink: for in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome man will ſay,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Object.</hi>
                  </note> there remains ſo much unthankfulneſs in the World, that one is ſoon diſcouraged (by peoples ingratitude) in the office of doing dood.</p>
               <p>But what ſaith the Lord,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Eccleſ. 11.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Caſt thy bread upon the waters, for after many dayes thou ſhalt find it.</hi> Though it ſeem no more to thee but as a ſtone ſunck down into the deep, or as a morſel of bread in the water, that floates from the ſight of him that caſt it in, without poſſibility of recovering it again, or receiving any fruit or benefit from the ſame; yet ceaſe not to caſt it there, <hi>for after many dayes thou ſhalt find it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome man replies,
<note place="margin">Objection.</note> I do good to ſome already; I give ſomething to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of a Schollar in the Univerſity; ſomewhat I do for the binding of a poor Child to an Apprentiſhip, and I have beſtowed my good will towards the ſetting up of a young beginner in his trade, what is there no end of doing good?</p>
               <p>Mark again,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the adviſe of <hi>Solomon</hi> for that; <hi>Give a portion to ſeven, and to eight.</hi> If thou have done good to one, extend it to a ſecond, to a third, and again to a fourth, <pb n="455" facs="tcp:47453:235"/>and a ſift, and ſixt, and a ſeventh, and to eight, and ſo long as there remains an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mercy, and power in thine hands to do it, though thou haſt extended the like bounty to ſeven, and to eight already.</p>
               <p>Some man will anſwer again,
<note place="margin">Objection.</note> that by this courſe (if every man beſtow his benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſo largely) no man could become rich in this life; and God appoints ſome rich men in this World as well as poor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> anſwers that objection thus.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>If the Clouds be full they pour down rain.</hi> As if he ſhould have argued thus. God hath beſtowed riches on men, as he hath given rain to the Clouds, he gave them that ſuperfluity of waters to pour down on the earth for the benefit of the ſame; and not that they ſhall ſtill detain it to no purpoſe at all: So God hath given riches to men, that when they arive at a fulneſs of eſtate, they ſhould then pour down and diſtil the fruits of that bleſſing on them that are poor and live in neceſſity, as the rain deſcends upon dry clods of earth.</p>
               <p>But ſome man will ſay,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Objection.</hi>
                  </note> a man might pour down comfort, but the ill ſucceſs it meets with, and the little good it begets in them on whom it is beſtowed (for they oftentimes become worſe, by the receipt of ſuch benefits,) diſheartens the giver from the extending of his charity according to Gods command, and his own good nature.</p>
               <p>Saith <hi>Solomon</hi> for that;
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                  <hi>As the Tree falls ſo it lyes, whether to the Eaſt, or Weſt, to North, or South;</hi> his meaning is this, As the Tree being hewen down (lie which way it will) falls to the profit and advantage of the owner: ſo it proves with all things thou performeſt with intent to pleaſe God, and glorifie him, though they fall more proſperous, or leſs proſperous in the event; yet the concluſion converts them all to the glory of God, his pleaſure, and the advantage of the owner; and there they lie, and their recompence alſo.</p>
               <p>But ſome man may ſay,
<note place="margin">Objection.</note> I have continued a great while in the exerciſe of doing of good; I am now old, and have lived thus long at my trade, and thus long I have been a Houſe-keeper, and thus long have had an eſtate in my hands; all which time I have ever employed my ſelf in the performance of good offices for others, and did not intermit any occaſion that might invite me to the doing of good. And is it not yet time to ceaſe?</p>
               <p>No (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>in the morning ſowthy ſeed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                  <hi>and in the evening let not thy hands reſt.</hi> (For all thoſe words are but ſeveral anſwers, to ſeveral objections;) Sow thy ſeed in the morning of thy life, when they eſtate begins to be improved, and then even in the evening of thy life, when thou haſt left off gaining, ceaſe not to perſiſt in giving,</p>
               <p>Saith another man;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Objection.</hi>
                  </note> You muſt not lop the twig too ſoon, that is but beginning to grow. I am but now in the way to thrive, and when I am further entred into that courſe, I will not fail to extend my goodneſs to others.</p>
               <p>Sow thy ſeed in the morning of thy life.</p>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
               <p>But ſaith another man,
<note place="margin">Objection.</note> I have done that already, and now it ceaſeth to be with me as before, by reaſon I follow not my trade, and have no more poſſibility of getting.</p>
               <p>But let not thy hand ceaſe in the evening,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſaith God. When thy ſhop windows are ſhut up, thy compaſſion muſt ſtill continue open, when thou haſt bid gain adue, and taken thy leave of all the wayes of getting: even then, if thou enjoy an eſtate in thine hands, and ability to do good, there is no excuſe for thee to ceaſe from beſtowing it, though it be in the evening. Thus we ſee there is no time excepted, nor perſon to be refuſed if neceſſity require; but a man muſt do good to all men at all times. So much for that.</p>
               <p>But the matter chiefly intended is theſe two;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there are ſome poor of the houſhold of faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.</note> That is the firſt. God hath (in the houſhold of faith) ſome that ſtand in need of relief.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that <hi>all that are in the houſhold, ſhould eſpecially look unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt (I ſay) <hi>there are ſome of the houſhold of faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>true believers, whoſe wants call for reliefe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So we ſee Chriſts ſpeaks as it were for himſelf,
<note place="margin">1 There are ſome poor of the houſhold of faith. Mat. 15.</note> when he ſpeaks of them; <hi>I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and you did not feed me; I was naked and you did not cloath me.</hi> Thoſe that Chriſt owns as his, and accounts them a part of himſelf, even thoſe are hungry and <pb n="456" facs="tcp:47453:236"/>naked.
<note place="margin">Iames 1.</note> And ſo likewiſe, <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this world rich in faith.</hi> They be rich in faith, and ſo of Gods houſhould of faith, and yet nevertheleſs poor in this world. You ſhall ſee an example of this. A Widdow comes to <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet, and tels him;
<note place="margin">1 King: 4: 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Thy ſervant, my husband, was a man fearing God: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the creditor is coming upon me, and will have my ſons to be bond-ſlaves.</hi> The man feared God, and yet nevertheleſs the poor Widdow wanted means, and her ſons muſt be expoſed to extremity of bondage for diſcharge of his fathers ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. A hard caſe, and yet the caſe of a man fearing God.</p>
               <p>You ſee there are thoſe of <hi>Macedonia,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> We ſee a poor man, and yet an heir of heaven, lying full of ſores, and in want, at the gate of <hi>Dives,</hi> that was after thrown into hell: An heir of heaven, and yet on earth a Beggar.</p>
               <p>You ſee then (beloved) the point is true: now we will deſcend, and ſee how it appears to be ſo, and for what reſpect it comes to paſs, by Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

<note place="margin">Luk 9: 53.</note> in oppoſition of the wayes of God.

                  </note> becauſe that for this intent hath God given riches unto ſome that have grace, that ſo they might eſpecially adminiſter the confort that wealth brings with it, unto thoſe that are poor of the ſame houſhold and profeſſion of grace: I ſay, for this very reaſon, God hath furniſhed ſome of his Elect with wealth and opportunities; that above all other they might reſerve a diligent care and reſpect towards others that ſhare with them in the ſame Grace; if they do not, I am certain the world will not; for of all other people, thoſe that fear God are the perſons to whom they wiſh moſt unhappineſs, and ſhorteſt continuance of life in this World. Therefore hath God given wealth to thoſe that have Grace, that they might miniſter a ſeaſonable reliefe to others, whoſe wants do call for it. <hi>Let the brother of low degree, rejoyce in that he is exalted; and let the brother of high degree, rejoyce in that he is made low:</hi> what is the low bringing of the brother in high degree, but that he becomes ſervant to him of low degree; his wealth and revenews, nay all that he enjoyes, he confeſſeth to be for the ſervice of the pooreſt Chriſtian. Then hath the brother of low degree occaſion enough to rejoyce, becauſe the brother of high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree receives both exaltation, wealth, and preferment, and all that he poſſeſſeth for his good. And therefore beloved, do not ſlightly paſs by this neceſſary duty, for it will require your ſerious conſideration, and your beſt ability to perform it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> the neer union and relation between one and another, ſhould be a ſtrong obligation upon thoſe that are rich eſpecially, to extend their care and eſtate to thoſe of low degree, having grace: for they are brethren, and there is a ſtrong bond that combines them together, having all the ſame Father to beget them, they are begotten by the ſame Word of Truth, they enjoy the ſame Mother the Church: <hi>Jeruſalem that is above is free, and is the Mother of us all;</hi> they are brethren together of the ſame Family. And therefore (beloved) let men ſee and acknowledg this, that whatſoever difference there is of Nation,
<note place="margin">Mat 15.</note> yet they are all of the ſame Houſhold in this reſpect. You ſee the <hi>Jews</hi> notwithſtanding they were diſtinguiſhed by Tribes, yet they are all nominated together, the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So all the people of God let their diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be never ſo diſtant in reſpect of wealth, of natural birth, of deſcent or outward ornament; they are brethren of the ſame Family notwithſtanding. Beloved, let us look to this Point, we are all brethren, and all of the ſame Houſe.</p>
               <p>Is it not a ſhame then when one brother is full,
<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> to ſuffer another to die with famine and hunger; for one of the ſame Houſe to let his brother ſinck under reproach and diſgrace, not offering his aſſiſtance, or his hand to help him, and prevent his extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If this be the task and duty of Chriſtians, that they ſhould eſpecially look to them of the Houſhold of Faith; let the inſtruction ſtir up our endeavours to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty; and above all the affection we bear to others, let the reſpect we bear to the people of God be advanced. Saith our Saviour Chriſt, when you come to a place, <hi>ask who is worthy:</hi> and I could heartily wiſh that you (who intend any work of mercy, out of the eſtate which the providence of God hath enabled you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, according to the command of this duty) would propound the ſame rule unto your ſelves, enquiring firſt who are worthy. Beſtow not your charity at randome, as it is the manner of many; ſuch are in want; and they look no further: but enquire where you may be furniſhed with better directions, who are worthy, and who are of <hi>the houſhold of Faith,</hi> and inhabitants of the Family; ſuch you are to labour to find, and having found them, look to them.</p>
               <p>And the more to incite you to this duty, know that Chriſt calls for it, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually expect it; He would have you (eſpecially) to have an eye to his members: <hi>I was hungry, and you did not feed me;</hi> he calls for it that gave you your wealth.</p>
               <p>Neither doth he demand any thing that is not his own,
<note place="margin">1 Chron 29.</note> as <hi>David</hi> confeſſeth in his Proviſion for the Temple, <hi>of thine own have I given thee:</hi> ſo you may account of whatſoever Chriſt calls for, if it be to your eſtate; it came by his donation, and he gave it you firſt. If you beſtow any gift on your Children, you think you may reſerve that power unto your ſelves, to take it again at your pleaſure and give it unto whom you liſt; and ſhall not God be allowed that priviledge, he that confers many liberal bleſſings on thee? Sure thou art much in his debt, and it argues too foul an ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <pb n="459" facs="tcp:47453:237"/>if he lend thee a Million, and thou refuſeſt to pay him a Mite.</p>
               <p>Again, if he call for it, 'tis not for thy loſs that he requires it, but will give thee better riches, <hi>Ask of him, and he will give you the holy Ghoſt;</hi> nay, <hi>the kingdome of Heaven:</hi> and thoſe are riches farr above the value of any ſubſtance thou enjoyeſt; Ask of him and he will forgive your ſins, 10000. Talents, whereas hedemands but one penny of thee. I dare ſay he doth greater things for thee already, then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for others.</p>
               <p>Again, conſider what want you have of him that demands this. He gives you dayly bread, (<hi>give us this day our dayly bread;</hi>) if you did nor receive dayly bread, and a bleſſing on it from him, you neither could have bread, nor enjoy life by it.</p>
               <p>Again, mark on what terms he requires it, 'tis but to belent; and to be lent upon Uſury too. Many covetous earth-worms, would be glad to hear of the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by Intereſt of mony, yet no Uſury is lawful except this and this is ſpoken (in this phraſe) to no other purpoſe, but to convince the world of ſin, that ſeek gain to their own loſs, and procure their profit a wrong way. <hi>He that gives to the poor, he lends to the Lord upon Uſury.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov 19.17.</note> It is the confeſſion of the Uſurer, that to receive ten in the hundred, is great gain; and he concludes, that much advantage doth acrue to his Coffers, and accounts it a proſperous profeſſion. Miſerable trading, when we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change our Souls, and expoſe them to eternal deſtruction; for the procurement of a little wealth of this world, which hath not a minutes ſubſiſtance. But <hi>This</hi> is the trade of advantage, not ten in the hundred, but a hundred for ten, nay a hundred for one. To enjoy a hundred for one here, and (in the world to come) eternal life, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage far above the compariſon of any gain the earth can afford us.</p>
               <p>Further, mark who it is that asks this at thy hands, even he whoſe favour thou muſt one day ſeek; for whoſe countenance thou wouldeſt, give all the world; it is he before whoſe ſeat thou muſt appear, that calls for this duty of doing good with thy eſtate while thou enjoyeſt it: deny not this ſmall courteſie to him, leſt his favours (being abuſed) turn into anger, and thou become a miſerable inſtance of his heavy diſpleaſure. No man deſiring the favour of a Prince or Judge in ſome buſineſs of importance, but would gladly embrace an occaſion of doing him a pleaſure, before the tryal of his cauſe, that ſo the Judge may take notice of his good will, and gratifie his kindneſs. Beloved, we have, ſpecial uſe for the favour of Chriſt, and <hi>muſt all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before his Judgment ſeat.</hi> Now we have opportunity ſufficient, Chriſt in his poor members of <hi>the houſhold of faith</hi> comes to you, expecting favour at your hands; he wills you to do good to them, and to him in them; What you beſtow on them, he accounts as a courteſie to himſelf. In as much as you have done it to theſe, it extends unto him; and what is denyed them, he takes it as an injury to himſelf, Inaſmuch as you have not done it to thoſe, you have not done it to him. Therefore, look how you extend mercy here, to enjoy it hereafter; and as you expect the favour of the Judge, make way for his kindneſs, by the performance of his will, in a ſeaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution during this life; he that uſeth not mercy here, ſhall find none hereafter; and <hi>Judgment ſhall be mercileſs</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to them that ſhew not mency,</hi> Nay, look that ſuch mercy be ſhown as God expecteth; you that are wealthy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wealth, and riches you poſſeſs. God will accept of no beggarly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from a wealthy man, neither will he receive a poor reward from the Coffers of him that hath hoarded up much <hi>red clay: where he hath ſown liberally, he will reap leberally.</hi> Look to it, for Chriſt looks for it. Wouldeſt thou reap liberally in that day? then ſow liberally in the mean time. Do according to your ſeveral abilities, and opportunities: and when you meet with advantage to do good, take it chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and make uſe of it willingly; it will much commend thy love to Religion, and improve thine own good in the concluſion. So much ſhall ſerve now for this point; You ſee in a word the meaning and intent of the Apoſtle is this, that every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his eſtate and ability, while he hath time and means, ſhould beſtir himſelf <hi>to do good.</hi>

                  <p>The life of our deceaſed Siſter, was but a commentary upon this Text; She hath been (amongſt thoſe that knew her, in her life) a lively pattern, and example, of the performance of every duty, that we have now ſpoken of. It pleaſed God to tranſlate her as a choice Plant from a far Countrey) a Nurcery amongſt the Churches in other parts) into his Vineyard, into his Garden, into his Orchard: his Church here in <hi>England.</hi> Since ſhe came hither, and hath been planted here; She became no fruitleſs, nor dead tree, but according to the bleſſing promiſed to that man which <hi>meditates in the law of God,</hi>

                  <p>After, it pleaſed God when ſhe came to <hi>England,</hi> to reveal to her, <hi>the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation more fully</hi> then ſhe knew before, to make her underſtand more clearly of the power of godlineſs, and what the practice of Chriſtianity meant, which ſhe before had received only in the Theory, in forms of doctrines, but not ſo heartily, and ſerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looking into them. She grew very covetous of good company, and (the benefit that comes by that) good conference and example.</p>
                  <p>She made great advantage of her time, in the large ſenſe of doing good. She took her opportunities to do good to her ſelf and her ſoul, by the obtaining of <hi>the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in Chriſt;</hi> and yet nevertheleſs, even towards her latter end (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded that ſhe had done enough that way) ſhe promiſed to act <hi>Maries part</hi> more lively, if God would ſpare her longer time on earth, and exceed her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vertues, by her latter endeavours, and to refrain from <hi>Martha's trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe opportunities ſhe embraced in health (by the providence and goodneſs of God) were managed by her, with ſuch care and reſpect, that ſucceſs followed their concluſions with much advantage. She increaſed in love (that radical grace) as the ſap doth increaſe in the root, extending that love to Chriſt and to the ſervants of God: ever delighting in their company; prizing them at a high rate, as the only excellent ones, and ſome very poor and weak Chriſtians; naming them according to the phraſe of our Saviour, <hi>worthy perſons;</hi> and ſuch a one was a worthy man, or a worthy woman, being the tearms wherewith ſhe expreſſed her honourable eſteem of thoſe that ſeared the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, in the whole courſe of her life ſhe exerciſed the Scriptures, I have ſeen notes of her own gathering out of the Scripture: wherein it ſeemed ſhe deſired to become a profitable reader, in making uſe of ſuch particular places as ſtruck againſt ſuch cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, which ſhe was more eſpecially deſirous to take notice of: and ſuch directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to duties, and incouragements by promiſe were likewiſe inſerted therein, that (I am perſwaded) I cannot do better then to commend this duty to the practice of all the ſervants of God, that when they come to peruſe the Scriptures, they would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelves with pen and inke, and then upon all occaſions they may be noting down ſomewhat for their own advantage: that they may have a manual, or little book of obſervations, for their guide and direction in the courſe of their lives.</p>
                  <p>She was a hearty hater of ſin, and of all evil, and the appearance thereof, being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do good ſo far as ſhe was convinced in any thing to her revealed, and willing to receive inſtructions, and to be informed in thoſe things that were not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Not only of her own, wherein ſhe took her Husbands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with her; But where ſhe prov'd unable of her ſelf to ſupply the neceſſities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: her labours and endeavours to incite, and ſtir up others, made full ſatisfaction in the room of her benevolence, and ſhe became an induſtrious Chriſtian in that kind. That I have obſerved, herein ſhe was ever large and boundleſs: <hi>ſowing her ſeed in the morning, and her hands ceaſed not in the evening: ſhe gave a portion to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and alſo to eight:</hi> and as any came in her way that were in extream neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhe became a preſent helper of every of them, according to their ſeveral neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>She was very tender hearted, and that which ſhe beſtowed to relieve others; was done in compaſſion of heart towards thoſe that endured miſery. But as ſhe ſaw any <hi>of the houſhold of Faith,</hi> and the ſervants of God which ſhe took notice of by ſome infallible ſign: ſhe did not only relieve them with her Purſe, but receive them into her heart, which was ſtill open and enlarged to give them entertainment. She was not ſtraitned in her bowels toward them, but was large hearted, and large handed, full of Almes, when that might help; and when it could not, ſhe provoked others to exerciſe the like charity. Beſides, ſhe had other wayes to ſuccour them, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, and ſtirring up others to ſpeak for them, when words might availe them and do them good; relieving them with money, and provoking others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, when ſuch contributions were needful; and therein ſhe would not let ſlip the leaſt opportunity, but would take the advantage of great and ſolemn meetings; ſeaſoning thoſe feaſts which ſhe frequented with ſome acts of mercy before they parted, that the company and ſociety ſhe converſed with, might ſavour of this ſweetneſs of mercy as a precious oyntment, and become good examples unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and improve the gifts and abilites which God had given them to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>She was not only mindful of thoſe at home, but <hi>her goodneſs extended to the Saints</hi> abroad. And not in reſpect of Nature only, becauſe they were come into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where ſhe was born, (I ſpeak now of thoſe that live in diſtreſs and exile, of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi>) but in reſpect of Grace. She was wondrous induſtrious and laborious, to procure all the means that might be to ſend over to help them, and even <hi>refreſhed the bowels of the Saints;</hi> that I may truly ſay, <hi>the loynes of the poor,</hi> bleſſed God for her in many places. In what place hath ſhe lived, and hath not left a ſavour behind her? nay, (almoſt) in what company hath ſhe converſed, but this particular duty hath been as a precious oyntment to ſweeten the converſations of all that were about her; and to work in their minds a vertuous intention and propenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this duty? Beloved, here you have her in her carriage and example.</p>
                  <p>What ſhe was in her behaviour towards her Husband, and her Children, I need not ſpeak, there are enough can witneſs it; ſhe carried her ſelf as became a Wife to him, and a helper of the ſervants of God with prayers and deſires, and often provocations and incitings that way. But for her Children, ſhe ſeem'd to undergo a ſecond tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with them, <hi>till Chriſt were formed in them;</hi> being full of earneſt deſires and petitions for the working of Grace, where it was not begun, and for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecting thereof, where it was newly entred. She rejoyced exceedingly in any expreſſion of good, and more for that of Grace, then any other inclination or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, this was obvious and common to all, and any man might take ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof daily, and obſerve it conſtantly. In her ſervants, as there appeared the more grace in any; ſo much the more reſpect ſhe extended towards them. In the poor, as ſhe perceived the more grace in any; the more relieſe they received from her, &amp;c. I ſay nothing what (in all this) ſhe ſuffered; thoſe that were acquainted with her diſeaſe, know what paines ſhe under-went in reſpect of her body, and with what patience ſhe ſubmitted to the hand of God in all things; And many know the <pb n="462" facs="tcp:47453:239"/>wrong ſhe endured from the World, for her deſire and care to do good when ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained opportunity. Some thought her over-bold, ſome too buſie; others thought her proud and vain-glorious, becauſe of her often frequenting of company, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing openly, for the provoking of others to the exerciſe of goodneſs. The Lord ſmite their hearts that are guilty of miſ-judging; that which we are to ſuppoſe in reſpect of her forward diſpoſition is this. She was naturally of a free ſpirit, which being ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Grace, and ſharpned with love and zeal for the glory of God; made her the more reſolute and familiar in frequenting good company; not to magniſie her ſelf by their ſociety, but that her continual converſation with them, might give her the better occaſion to incite and ſtir them to goodneſs. Let thoſe that are guilty of miſpriſion, leave to cenſure her Vertues, and convert them into an example for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to walk in, if they do not, the neglect will load their ſouls with more woe for ſuch contempt, then ſhe hath received joy for her labour.</p>
                  <p>What concern'd her in her ſickneſs, briefly I have not much to ſay; in that they which were about her daily, know more then I can relate: She did not only expreſs a ſatisfaction and aſſurance of heart, that her reconciliation was made with God in Chriſt: but beſides that, a willingneſs and deſire to be diſſolved, (for that reaſon) <hi>that ſhe might be with Chriſt.</hi> A Miniſter that was with her, asking how ſhe that had a Husband and Children, enjoying an eſtate and many other comforts, could be willing to forgo ſo many bleſſings, and exchange them all for death? She from that inward ſence and perſwaſion of Gods love to her in Chriſt, concluded; my Husband is dear, and my Children are dear to me, but Chriſt is dearer. Therefore I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forgo Husband and Children, and all the contents you can number in this life, that I might live with Chriſt, to partake of greater felicity then this world can afford me.</p>
                  <p>And now the Lord Jeſus hath received her into his own protection, and ſatisfied her expectation with the performance of his love.</p>
                  <p>But wherefore have we ſpoken all this? what, that we might add any praiſe unto the dead? no: But to quicken thoſe that are living, and incite them to the like duty. Some may think it impoſſible there ſhould be ſuch activeneſs in doing of good; and ſuch unwearedneſs in performing of the acts of mercy, and where (ſay they) ſhall we find ſuch an example? you have it before your eyes; and know that examples will riſe in judgment againſt you, and condemn you, as well as precepts: If you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them not, while they invite you. The Text ſaith; <hi>Do good to all, eſpecially to the houſhold of faith.</hi> And here is an example before our eyes, of one who took her time, and <hi>opportunity to do good to all, eſpecially to them of the houſhold of Faith. Go thou, and do likewiſe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Book of <hi>Job</hi> comprehends the Hiſtory of a good man, and of his many tryals. Though goodneſs deliver from Hell, yet it priviledgeth not from temptatious, or croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; yea, the more eminent Holineſs is, many times the more it is expoſed to ſharp and manifold aſſaults.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job</hi> is ſet upon on all ſides, he found the Devil a fore enemy, and his great eſtate a ſuddain ſhipwrack; his Children in a moment cruſht to pieces. He had but three Points of Land to look at in this troubleſome ſea, and every one of them ſeemed rather to augment, than to leſſen the ſtorm. His Wife, whoſe breath ſhould have ſweetned and eaſed his grief, was an impatient vexation. His friends, whoſe counſels and compaſſions ſhould have been an eaſie harbour, and tender relief, they became his bitter and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious judges. Yea, his God, who by his own teſtimony he ſerved, and feared with ſingular uprightneſs; and whoſe bowels are ever tender and compaſſionate to ſuch, and upon whoſe gracious acceptance he thought to quiet and anchor his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſpirit; yet anon he ſeemed not only a ſtranger, but an enemy; and this went <pb n="464" facs="tcp:47453:240"/>deep, that even Mercy it ſelf ſeemed cruel, and Kindneſs ſo unkind and harſh.</p>
               <p>But what was his behaviour under all theſe? For the general, ſweet and heavenly; For ſome particulars, ſad and weak; when ſaith did work he was above all his ſtorms. In the deepeſt calamity, ſaith can ſettle and compoſe the ſoul, and fill it with the ſweeteſt comforts. When ſence and nature did work, then he was much impatient, and the wind had the better over him: In the one be ſhews himſelf a Chriſtian, In the other a man: In the one <hi>Job</hi> is beyond himſelf, in the other below himſelf. According to the time and manner of theſe ſeveral workings, he is like or unlike himſelf. Thus it is with the beſt, whoſe outward change doth not more vary; but their inward carriage doth as much change. At length <hi>Job</hi> after many diſputes with his friends, and conflicts with himſelf, concenterates his thoughts in two main Points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One was ſtill to truſt in God, let him be what he will, and let him do what he will, though he ſhould continue his preſent trials, yea and exceed them; though he ſhould kill me, yet ſaith he (Chap. 13.15.) <hi>though he ſtay me, I will truſt in him,</hi> and there he diſpoſeth of his ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another was to prepare for death; all the dayes of my appointed time I will wait till my change come, and there he diſpoſeth of his body. Many arguments he layeth down in this Chapter which did occaſion him to theſe thoughts and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the brevity of mans life: Verſ. 1, 2. <hi>Man that is born of a Woman is of few dayes, he cometh forth like a Flower, and is cut down; he fleeth alſo as a ſhadow, and continueth not;</hi> He ſaith not years, nor moneths, nor weeks, but dayes, and theſe dayes not many but few, and theſe few dayes, not long, but ſhort, as quickly ſet as the ſhadow, as quickly cropt as the flower.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the miſery of that ſhort life, in the ſame place, <hi>and full of trouble;</hi> as if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Article of life were repleniſhed with ſorrow, even as every vein of the body is with bloud: this his own experience could tell him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the certainty of Death, The Sun hath his appointed race, which in the Winter is ſhort, in the Summer long, but in both it hath a certain time of ſetting; ſo the race of mans life, to ſome it may be ſhorter, to ſome longer, but the night will come, and all muſt be cloſed up in Death, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>His dayes are determined, the number of them, they are with thee, thou haſt appointed his bounds which be cannot paſſe;</hi> and if ſo, then high time for <hi>Job</hi> to think of it, and prepare for it.</p>
               <p>Death began in a manner to ſeize on him already in ſeveral parts; in his feet, for his wealth was gone; in his loynes, having loſt his children; in his heart, his friends leaving him; in his boſome, for his wife was a diſcomforter; nay, in his very life it ſelf, ſo much as was wrapt up in the outward part of his body, for that was diſeaſed; in his ſpeech and ſpirits, they grow hoarſe and faint, all theſe were the harbingers of a future diſſolution. Well therefore might <hi>Job</hi> conclude, ever I muſt not live, and long I cannot live; therefore though in much miſery, and in had dayes. I will think of Death, and fit my ſelf for a good end, and apply my ſelf ſeriouſly, and wiſely for a good work; <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time will I wait till my change come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which words contain in them two parts.</p>
               <note place="margin">Parts of the Text.</note>
               <p>Firſt, his future diſſolution, which he calls a <hi>change,</hi> and a change that is coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as if he had been the next man, <hi>till my change come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, his preſent diſpoſition, <hi>I will wait,</hi> he thinks of death, before death, and prepares to die, while yet he lives. Neither was this a death pang, a ſit, a humour which began quickly, and expired ſuddenly. Nay, he will make it a ſerious buſineſs, as if this ſhould be his every dayes work; <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time will I wait.</hi> Some read it of my appointed warfare, and others of my appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted labour; they all intimate that he means by his appointed time, his appointed life; the leaſe or term of breathing, which God had allotted, allowed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:47453:240"/>There are two propoſitions which naturally iſſue from the words, and comprehend the juyce and marrow of the Text.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that there is a change, which will befall the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſhould alwayes wait till it come; I begin with the firſt; that,<lb/>
                  <hi>There is a change which will befall the ſons of men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A change will befall all the ſons of men.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Be we poor, or be we rich; be we noble, or be we ignoble; be we proſperous, or be we afflicted; be we ſtrong, or be we weak; be we old, or be we young; be we good, or be we bad; be we male, or be we female; whatſoever our natures be, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our parrs be, whatſoever our places be, whatſoever our ages be, whatſoever our courſes be, whatſoever our wayes be; how fair and how durable our eſtates may appear, yet at length there is a change which will befall us. That which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpake in a pathetical way, <hi>Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not;</hi> may truly be ſaid of all the ſons of men; once they were, now they are not: though once we rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned them upon our account, yet at length they are ſhut out, and ſtand aſide as cyphers.</p>
               <p>But that you may the better underſtand what change it is that is here meant, you are to know, that there is a fourfold change.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a change of the condition, this I call a temporal change, wherein ſome, or more, or all, of our outward comforts, are ſhrivelled, and ſeared up by ſome preſent miſery. When poverty breaks in upon us, as the hunter doth upon his game; and cauſeth our riches as ſo many birds (to which <hi>Solomon</hi> compares them,) to take to themſelves wings and flie away. When ſickneſs ſtayeth our health in the bed, and impriſoneth us to the chamber. When our friends glide away from us, like a river through their Apoſtacy, or ſtart aſide like a broken bow through their falſhood or treachery. When the neer relation of Husband and Wife. Parents and Children is cut aſunder, and the many ſad tears for their loſs, imbitter all our former comforts. But this is not the change intended in the Text.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a change of the Body, and this I call a corporal change, for even theſe vild bodies of ours ſhall be changed. Look as the ſpring is a refreſhing change to the ſeaſon of the year, ſo ſhall the Reſurrection be an exceeding change to our bodies; or as the morning is a change to the night, ſo at the Reſurrection ſhall our bodies awake, and their corruption ſhall put on incorruption; neither is this the change which <hi>Job</hi> here intends immediatly, though ſome expound his aim to be at this, from whom I cannot abſolutely diſſent, yet I think they hit not the right ſcope.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is a change of the Soul, that I call a Spiritual change, wrought in the ſoul by the ſpirit of God: nothing makes in this life ſuch a change as true grace. <hi>We all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. This change is like the turning of a diſordered inſtrument, or like the refining of corrupt mettal, or like the clearing of the dark air; or like the quickening of a dead <hi>Lazarus;</hi> but neither is this change that the text intends.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, there is a change of the life, and this I call a mortal change, we ſhall all be changed, faith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5. life hath the firſt courſe, but death will have the ſecond. As in a Comedy ſeveral perſons, have ſeveral parts to act, which when they have diſpatched; they all draw off of the ſtage; ſo though in life we all preſent our ſelves on the ſtage of this world, and act ſeveral Scenes and parts, yet at length we muſt all retire and paſs away through one and the ſame door of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. This is the change which <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of, to wit, a change of this life by Death.</p>
               <p>Here then are two things to be demonſtrated, and proved, for the making good of the point in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That death is a change. 2. That this change of death will befall all the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Death a change, and why ſo termed.</note> that Death is a change, not an anihilation. A change is a different, and a divers order, or manner of being. Anihilation is one thing, and mutation is another <pb n="466" facs="tcp:47453:241"/>thing: there the thing ceaſeth utterly to be; here the thing only ceaſeth to be as once it was; ſo it is with Death, it doth not reduce us to nothing, but alter our former ſomething, it changes our manner, or order of being, not our being abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve, Death is a change in five reſpects;</p>
               <p>Firſt, it changes that neer union of the Soul and the body, and makes of one two ſeverals; they that were as the hands mutually claſped, or as two perſons conjugal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tyed together, when Death comes it plucks them aſunder, and divides one from the other, as far as heaven is from the earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it changes our actions or work. Whiles life remained here in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, while our day laſted, we might have ſed the hungry, clothed the naked, viſited the ſick, relieved the diſtreſſed, frequented the ordinances, bewailed our ſins; but when death once enters, the night is come, in which no man can work, thou art then turned, changed into an inſenſible, rotten, and loathſome carkaſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it changes our country. Whiles we live here, we are as children put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to ſchool in a ſtrange place; hence it is we are ſo often in the Scripture called Pilgrims and ſtrangers. This earth, this lower world is not the proper home of the Soul. But when Death comes we change our country, we go home to our own place, to our own City; the wicked ſhall go to their own place, as it is ſaid of <hi>Judas;</hi> and the godly to their own Mountain, to their own Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it changes our company. In this life we converſe with ſinful men, empty creatures, infinite miſeries, innumerable conflicts; but when Death comes, all this ſhall be changed, we ſhall go to our God, and Father, to our Chriſt and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and <hi>to the innumerable company of bleſſed Angels and Saints, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, it changes our outward condition. When Death comes thou ſhalt never ſee the wedge of gold again, thou ſhalt never find thy delights in ſin any more, all the excellency of the creature, and the contentments of them, and the ſenſual rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in them, ſhall go out with life: Death ſhall ſhut and cloſe them up in an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal night, which ſhall never riſe to another day. So much for the firſt thing, that Death is a change.</p>
               <p>I come now to ſpeak briefly of the ſecond,
<note place="margin">The change by death muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal all men.</note> that this change of Death will beſal all the ſons of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.48. <hi>What man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death, ſhall be delive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> his ſoul from the hand of the grave?</hi> We love to ſee moſt things, the eye is never ſatisfied with ſeeing, and yet many things there are which we ſhall never ſee. Every man cannot ſee that which one man doth, but there is one thing which every man ſhall ſee, he muſt ſee death. There are many enemies from whom we can deliver our ſelves, and many more from whom we may be delivered; but yet there is one enemy from which we cannot deſend our ſelves, nor be defended by others, he will be too ſtrong for every man; let him ſtrive, repine, order his dyet, intreat, do what he will or can; No (faith the Pſalmiſt) none ſhall deliver his ſoul from the hand of the grave. And he puts a <hi>Selah,</hi> a note of obſervation at the end of the verſe.</p>
               <p>That all the ſons of men are ſubject to this change by death, will appear to you by theſe familiar Arguments. The</p>
               <p>Firſt may be taken from the quality of our lives,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1.</note> which is ſweetly ſet out in the Scripture under the terms of changeable things, all which point out unto us the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of death; Sometime our life is compared to a ſhew, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.6. <hi>Surely eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man walketh in a vain ſhew.</hi> In a ſhew you know there is ſome deviſe or other opened, carryed a-while about, but at length it is ſhut up; ſo it is with our lives. Sometime again it is compared to a ſhade or a ſhadow, <hi>Job</hi> 8.9. <hi>Our dayes upon earth are a ſhadow;</hi> a ſhadow is but an imitation of a ſubſtance, a kind of nimble picture which is ſtill going and coming, and will ſet at laſt, perhaps it is ſuddenly ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed, ſo is our life. Sometimes again it is compared to a vapour, <hi>James</hi> 4.14. <hi>What is your life, it is even a vapour that vaniſheth away.</hi> like a poor cloud, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times looking white, ſometimes black; ſometimes quiet and ſettled, ſometimes again toſſed up and down with every wind, and at laſt conſumed and brought to nothing, ſo it is with our lives. Sometimes alſo compared to a Tale, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.9. <hi>We ſpend our</hi>

                  <hi>years as a tale: hat is told,</hi> a meer diſcourſe of this thing, and that thing, and indeed but a very parentheſis of a more tedious diſcourſe, and many times it is broken off in the very telling, ſo it is with our lives. Sometime again, it is as graſs, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. <hi>The voyce ſaid cry aloud; what ſhall I cry, all fleſh is graſs, and the goodlineſs thereof as the flower of the graſs.</hi> And verſe 7. <hi>The graſs withereth, and the flower fadeth, becauſe the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> in this chapter calleth it a Flower, <hi>He cometh forth</hi> (faith he) <hi>like a flower, and is cut down.</hi> A flower is a ſweet thing, but of an earthly breed, ſed with ſhowers, at its beſt, when it is in all its glory, it is but to day, and to morrow, it withereth, and is fit for nothing but the Oven; ſo it is with our lives.</p>
               <p>Many expreſſions of the like nature might be added, the Scripture is plentiful in theſe compariſons, comparing our life to the Spiders web, to a Weavers ſhuttle, to the breath of a candle, to a pilgrimage, to a journey, to the dayes of an hireling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all of them things of a changeable and variable nature.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument may be taken from the quality of our Natures,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2.</note> and there in there are two things conſiderable, both which imply a certainty of death.</p>
               <p>Firſt, our compoſition, and matter whereof we are made, we are reared out of a mouldering and waſting principle, our bodies are therefore ſtiled an earthly houſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. A houſe though of Iron will in time be cankered; but a houſe of earth, as it is moſt impotent againſt aſſaults, ſo it is of its own nature moſt apt, and ſubject to diſſolution. And in this reſpect alſo they are termed Tabernacles. Now a Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle you know is a thing of no perpetuity, made only to be ſoon ſet up, and that in a mans paſſage; and then as ſoon taken down again.</p>
               <p>Secondly, beſide this there is in our nature, ſin and corruption, and this is it that doth put us to the ſword, and cauſe this deadly change: this tears our lives with a continual conſumption. The tree breeds the worm, which will deſtroy the life of the tree; we in <hi>Adam</hi> gave leave to ſin, and now it is that ſin gives leave to death; <hi>In the day that thou ſhalt eat there of, thou ſhalt ſurely die, Gen.</hi> 2.17. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed over all men, in that all have ſinned.</hi> The ſhadow doth not ſo neerly attend the body of man as Death doth the body of ſin. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. the very <hi>wages of ſin is death.</hi> God ſhould do that man wrong that hath hired out his ſoul all his dayes to ſin, if he did not at night pay him with the wages of death.</p>
               <p>The third Argument may be drawn from the certainty of the Reſurrection,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.</note> we all believe the reſurrection of our bodies, and therefore we muſt needs conclude a change of our bodyes, for what is the Reſurrection but life from death, for <hi>the dead to hear the voyce of Chriſt and live?</hi> What is it but a breathing in of the ſoul again, the lighting of the candle again? the body could never be raiſed if it were not firſt changed; <hi>Thou fool,</hi> faith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>that which thou ſoweſt is not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, except it die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth Argument is from the infalibility of Gods decree,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>it is appointed unto men once to die, and after death to come to Judgment, Heb.</hi> 9.27. Thou maieſt ſooner expect, that the courſe of the heavens ſhall be altered, and the Center of the earth be diſlocated, then that the purpoſe of God concerning mans mortality ſhould be rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; any, that may be, <hi>for heaven and earth ſhall paſs away,</hi> but this ſhall never be, <hi>not one jot of the word of God ſhall fall to the ground.</hi> God hath purpoſed it; and none ſhall diſſanul it; nay, he hath eſtabliſhed his purpoſe with a word of confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>in the day thou eateſt therefore thou ſhalt</hi> [<hi>ſurely</hi>] <hi>die.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Do not deceive thy ſelf, but build upon it, I have ſpoken it, and <hi>will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the thing that is gone out of my mouth;</hi> as ſure as thou liveſt, if thou eateſt, thou ſhalt die.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the firſt aſſertion cleared unto you, I will addreſs my ſelf now to the ſecond, of which brieffy too, and then make Application of them both together.<lb/>
                  <hi>As there is a certainty of our change,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There are two things which I will here inquire of, for the fuller illuſtration of this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:47453:242"/>Firſt, what this continual waiting may import.</p>
               <p>Secondly, why there ſhould be ſuch a conſtant waiting for the day of our mortal change.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1 What it is to wait for death.</note> this continual waiting mainly imports two things; one a certain axpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death: for waiting is an act of Hope expecting ſomething. <hi>If we do hope for that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. a man is then ſaid to wait for death, when he is looking for it at every turn, as a Steward waits for his Maſter when he continually expects his return, when upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry voyce he hears, or upon every knock at the door, he ſaith, oh my Maſter is come, this is he that knocks. So a man is ſaid to wait for death, when in every action of his life, in every motion of his eſtate, in every paſſage of his courſes, ſaith; well I muſt die, when though his bones are full of marrow, yet I muſt die; when though riches come in like a flood, yet I muſt die; when changes appear upon himſelf, or others, yet I muſt die, I have no abiding here; <hi>I am but a ſojourner, and a ſtranger, as all my fathers were.</hi> I muſt not enjoy my Wife for ever, Children for ever, Friends for ever, Lands for ever, theſe comforts for ever, my life for ever, it is but a leaſe which may ſoon expire; I am but a ſteward, and I muſt be called to an account, ſuch a one is gone before, and I muſt follow after; the writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> hath ſeized on him. and for ought I know the next may be for me, ſo when death comes, I am ready to anſwer it as <hi>Abraham</hi> did his Son <hi>Iſaac, here I am;</hi> it comes not upon me <hi>as a thief in the night,</hi> when I am aſleep and think not of him; but as <hi>Jonathans</hi> arrow to <hi>David,</hi> who ſtayed in the field and expected when it ſhould be ſhot, and then he roſe up and embraced him: <hi>Yee brethren</hi> (faith <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.4.) <hi>are not in darkneſs, that that day ſhould overtake you as a theif, ye are all the children of the light, therefore let us not ſleep as do others, but let us watch and be ſober.</hi> This is the firſt thing that waiting imports. Another thing it imports, is a ſerious preparation for the day of our change; for it is not a naked expectation of a change, ariſing from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of death; but it is alſo a religious preparation, improving the intrim of time for the beſt advantage for a mans ſoul before the day of change doth come, which is here implyed in waiting. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it a remembring, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, whiles the evil dayes come not, and the years draw nigh, when thou ſhalt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them:</hi> what is this remembring of the Creator? but a care to know him, a fear to offend him, a ſtudy to obey him: and when is that to be done? Now, <hi>now remember:</hi> there muſt be a preſent acting of this; <hi>Moſes</hi> calls it a <hi>numbring of our dayes, Pſal.</hi> 90.12. and more then that, ſuch a numbring as is joyned with an <hi>applying of our hearts to wiſedome:</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe wiſedome it directs to the choyce of ſuch particular actions and works, as tend to happineſs, ſo ſhould a man (after his ſerious conſideration of death) apply himſelf to ſuch wayes and ſuch actions, by which he may comfortably cloſe up his life with death; it is a great point of wiſdome to ſute actions with their ends, to ſit and ſquare the wood before we build the houſe, to learn and diſcipline a troop before they go to battel; to rig and trim, and furniſh the ſhip, before we launch to ſea; this is preparation indeed.</p>
               <p>Now this preparation for death conſiſts in two things.
<note place="margin">Wherein the preparation for death conſiſts.</note> Firſt, in an undoing of that which unſits us to die: Brethren, he who is not fit to live, he is not yet fit to die, and that which ever maſters the life, will be of greateſt force in death. The Father ſpake it boldly on good grounds, <hi>I am not aſhamed to live, nor afraid to die:</hi> now that which unfits a man to die is ſin,
<note place="margin">1 In freeing our ſelves from ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>u our life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</note> it makes him find a bitter enemy of death. Oh when this <hi>Kng of terrours</hi> ſhall preſent himſelf by thy bed ſide with his arrows in his hands, I mean thy ſins; he will wound thee with infinite amazement and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; <hi>the ſting of death is ſin,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Thou doſt not prepare thy ſelf for death, if thou doſt not undo thy ſins which thou haſt done in thy life: the which conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">How that is done.</note> in a narrow ſearch of thy ſinfulneſs, both of nature, and practice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in a ſecret humbling of thy ſoul for them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in an unfeigned repentance and forſaking of them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in a conſtant imploring and obtaining of mercy for them, in the blood <pb n="469" facs="tcp:47453:242"/>of Chriſt. If thy ſoul doth give ſin its diſcharge now, death ſhall give thy ſoul a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2 In having our perſons qualified.</note> in the qualifying our perſons for the conqueſt of death; there are three things by which we ſhall be able chearfully to meet, and aſſuredly to conquer death.</p>
               <p>Firſt by having intereſt in the Lord Jeſus,
<note place="margin">How that is done.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law; but thanks be to God who hath given us victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If thou haſt gotten Chriſt into thy arms by faith, thou carrieſt thy peace, ſtrength, and advantage both through life and death. <hi>For we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ove then conquerors through him that loved us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. <hi>And to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain,</hi> faith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 11 21. If thou haſt a good Chriſt, thou maiſt be conſident of a good death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, renewedneſs of our nature. What Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpake of he Martyes (as ſome conjecture) <hi>Bleſſed and happy is he that hath part in the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power;</hi> that ſay I of a perſon renewed by the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying quality of Gods Spirit; I happy is he, he ſhall have power even over the firſt death. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſaith come,</hi> if a man hath gotten the heavenly Spirit which beautifies the ſoul with the ornaments of Grace, as the Bride is with her ornaments; he is a fitted perſon, he may well ſay to Death <hi>come,</hi> and to Chriſt, <hi>come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, uprightneſs of converſation, <hi>Righteouſneſs delivers form death,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>the righteous hath hope in his death;</hi> if a mans work be Chriſts ſervice, if he have a heart enclined to keep a good conſcience in all things, to keep himſelf exact to the rule, and to walk with God; <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant, which his Maſter when be cometh ſhall find ſo doing:</hi> that man that hath looked to Gods Word to guide his life, may confidently look up to Gods mercy, to comfort him in death. <hi>Remember O Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hezekiah, Iſa.</hi> 39.) <hi>how I have walked before thee intru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>h, and with a perfect beart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all this doth the waiting for our change import in the Text, to wit, a ſerious expectation of it;
<note place="margin">Why we muſt wait and be prepared for death.</note> firſt by undoing thoſe ſins of ours, which elſe for eyer will undo us, and by intereſting our perſons into Chriſt, from whom we muſt likewiſe receive the Spirit to change our hearts, and uprightneſs to form a new our converſation. But then you will ſay, Why muſt there be ſuch a waiting for this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> theſe grave cloths are too ſad for the freſhneſs of our life, and would you have us be like the mad-man in the Goſpel, who lived among the Sepulchres? Nay, I beſeech you let us conſider, and ſettle our thoughts a little, &amp; you ſhall be ſtayed with reaſon; there are many ſtrong Arguments &amp; reaſons why we ſhould thus wait, both by expectation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> preparation.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> it is the main errand of our life; God did not ſend us into the world to ſin, and to adorn our ſelves with the creature, but to bring him ſome honour, and then to die: the factor is not imployed to take his pleaſure abroad, but to do his Maſters work, and then to return home. <hi>Tortullien</hi> confeſſeth he was a great finner, and therefore born to repentance; therefore doth God give us life, and the Maſter allows the ſervant a candle to work by, that we may repent of our ſins, and get our hold in Chriſt, and work out our ſalvation, and do the great buſineſs of believing, to be good and to do good, and ſo by Death to go up to heaven.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> death is but once, and that needs to be well done which can be but once done; if there might be another ſpace after death, a ſecond edition to correct the faults and eſcapes of the former, then a preſent and ſpeedy preparation were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo neceſſary; but faith the Apoſtle, <hi>It is appointed for all men</hi> [<hi>once</hi>] <hi>to die, and after death to come to Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.27. no more but once. We uſually ſhadow out Death with an hour-glaſs; A fit emblem, but that when an hour-glaſs is run out, it may be turned again; but this once out, can be ſet up no more, thou ſhalt never live to amend thy errours in dying; O then how needful is it before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to prepare for Death!</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.</note> when death hath done with thee, then God will begin with thee; thou muſt once die, and after this come to judgment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. To judgment, what is that? thou muſt be preſented before the holy, and juſt, and great God, who is the <pb n="470" facs="tcp:47453:243"/>Judge of the quick and the dead, and with all that thou art, and with all that thou haſt done, there muſt appear then before him all the courſes of thy life; all the bent of thy affections, all the ſecrets of thy heart ſhall then be pulled in peeces, and opened, and all thy works, and all thy words ſhall be exhibited, ſcann'd, and ſurveyed, and that with ſeverity and righteouſneſs; how ſay you then, is it not fit to be preparing for Death, to ſit thy ſoul, to reforme thy heart and life? wilt thou be preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods ſevere Judgment-ſeat with Uſury in thy bags, with bribes and oppreſſion in thy hands, with a ſcum of holineſs in thy mind, with uncleanneſs in thy members, with drnnkenneſs in thy mouth, with ſwearing in thy tongue? O Lord, I tremble to think of it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4.</note> the ſoul when it is once gone by Death, can never be recovered any more, the tree may be cut, and that may grow again, the ſhip may be loſt, and the wealth laboured up again, but if the glaſs be broken in peeces, it cannot be made whole again; the ſoul of man is but one, and the loſs of that one, is the loſs of it for ever; when death hath cloſed up thy eyes, thou ſhalt never have opportunity to pray more, to weep more, to humble thy ſelf more, to faſt more. Never any Prophet or Apoſtle ſhall come unto thee in the name of God more; after death all the Ordinances ceaſe unto thee for ever, and all the ſpace of returning ſhall ceaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee for ever; thou ſhalt not lie a few years in flames of wrath, and then get leave to come out and take a better courſe; O no, if once there, then for ever there; this life is the time of mercy and ſpace of repentance, but when Death ſhall deliver thee up to be judged by the Lord, thou muſt ſtand for ever to his ſentence; therefore as Chriſt ſpake, <hi>Agree with thine adverſary while thou art in the way, leſt the Judge deliver thee to the officer, and he caſt thee into priſon; I tell thee thou ſhalt not depart thence, till thou haſt paid the laſt mite,</hi> Luke. 12.58. And get oyle into your lamps before the door be ſhut.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, conſider it will be as much as thou canſt do, to do the work of Death, when Death doth come; therefore prepare and get all thy other work done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>For, my Beloved, conſider three things;</p>
               <p>Firſt, Conſcience uſually is moſt active at the time of death; a man that could with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and ſilence it in his life, yet when he comes to die, he ſhall here his voyce, and perhaps not be able to ſtand under the bitter indictments, and manifold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of it; then it will ſpread the book of thy life before thee, and then, and there thou ſhall ſee thy ſins as gaſtly preſented, as if they were ſo many wounds new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thy patience will be tried with variety of pain, interruption of ſleep, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place will be a thorn to thee, and every action a burden.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thy faith may be tried to the utmoſt, if thou lookeſt to thy Wiſe, her tears may trouble thee; if to thy Children, their cries may perplex thee; if to thy friends, they may be diſcomforters to thee; and will Satan let the alone all this while, will he let him lie down in comfort, who would not ſcarce let him live an hour in peace? oh what a victory would it be, if he could at the laſt make thee caſt away thy conſidence! it is true the cannot attain it, but he may deſperately attempt it. Why brethren, who knoweth the power of theſe ſharp temptations which may then beſet him? Verily, all the holineſs which we have attained already, all the duties we have performed already; we may then look on them with tears, and cry out, O why no ſooner? why no better? why no more? then all the ſtrength of thy faith will be little enough to ſupport thee.</p>
               <p>Will there then be a change befall even all the ſons of men.

               <p>Firſt, it is a change which ſhall put a period to all his changes in this life: his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition, how oft doth it change? ſometime by joy and ſorrow, ſometime by comfort and miſery, by health and ſickneſs, by abundance and want, but when Death comes, all ſorrow ſhall fly away for ever; thou ſhalt never be more troubled with a ſick body, with a ſad eſtate, with common loſſes; but the change of a temporal life, ſhall ſet thee in a full and ſettled poſſeſſion of an heavenly. His inward condition how oft doth it change? ſometime free, anon diſtreſſed; now a ſweet view of heaven, anon darkned with fear; now rejoycing in Chriſt, anon buffeted with Sathan; now bleſſing God for grace, anon diſtracted with the inſolent workings of remaining cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: but when death comes, then comes a change of all this, it will releaſe thee for ever of ſin and Sathan; after death ſin ſhall be a burden no more, and Sathan ſhall be a tempter no longer, but thou ſhalt be as happy as thou canſt deſire, and ſhalt enjoy thy God, and thy Chriſt, without fear of trouble, in glory, in felicity, in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; all the cruel inſolencies of tyrants, ſhall come ſhort of thy ſoul, thou ſhalt be above their malice, and beyond thy ſelf.</p>

               <p>And thus as before the old man, ſo now the new man goeth to his long and eternal home, without any reſting place between, at which all the ordinary ſort of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts muſt bait, though little for their eaſe, cooling or refreſhing, for it is in a hot-houſe; nay, a houſe all on fire; nay all of fire, and that as hot as hell; I mean <hi>Purgatory,</hi> wherewith if <hi>Solomon</hi> had been acquainted, he would have changed this <hi>motto of mortality,</hi> and not have ſaid, <hi>man goeth to his eternal home;</hi> but to his purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bath, and the Friers go about the ſtreets ſinging Maſſes and Dirges for his ſoul; aſſuredly if the ſouls of thoſe that die under the Goſpel need a ſacrifice to deliver them from the torment of a temporary hell, or <hi>Purgatory</hi> fire, the ſouls of them that died under the Law much more needed it; why then did <hi>Moſes</hi> appoint none for them? why did none of the inſpired Prophets pray for the releaſe of their ſouls? <hi>Solomon</hi> if there had been ſuch a ſtop in the mid-way, would have made a pauſe in his ſpeech, and not ſaid immediately man goeth, <hi>In domum eternit at is ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>If there be a <hi>Purgatory</hi> for Souls after this life, why not for bodies alſo which need as much purging as ſouls? if ſuch a place be to be found, we are certainly like to hear of it from Philoſophy or Divinity, and may diſcover it either in the map of the World, or in the type of Heaven, the holy Scripture. Nature gives us no notice of any ſuch place;
<note place="margin">Scelus aut ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uritur igue.</note> in Scripture we find indeed a Purgatory, but it is either in the <hi>laver of our regeneration,</hi> or in the blood of our redemption, for ſo we read, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth,</hi> or purgeth <hi>us from all ſins;</hi> if from all ſins, then none are left to be burned out with Purgatory fire. The Philoſophers indeed deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe a fire in the night, which they call <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> or the fools fire, becauſe it leads fools out of their way, whereby they often fall into boggs, or theeves hands; is not this Romiſh Purgatory, that <hi>ignis fatuus,</hi> that leads fools in the night of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour out of their right way, whereby they truly fall into theeves hands?

But I liſt not to dwell any longer in Purgatory, becauſe there is no ſuch real place, either in the world, or out of it.

               <p>The Application of the Text to this ſad occaſion.
<note place="margin">Application</note> As a contrary order is uſed in a compoſitive method, to that which is taken in a reſolutive, ſo I muſt now uſe in the Application of my Text, a method direct contrary to that which I followed in my Explication: for therein firſt I ſhewed you how the natural man goeth to his long, and the Spiritual to his eternal home; and after how, and why, and what ſort of Mourners went about the ſtreets lamenitng the deceaſed; but now I am firſt to ſpeak of the Mourners, who have already finiſhed their circular motion, and then of the direct motion of the <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>man</hi> of quality, the <hi>man</hi> of worth, the <hi>man</hi> of eſtate and credit, who is already arived at his <hi>long Lete,</hi> and now entring into his long home.</p>
               <p>Touching the Mourners I cannot but take notice of their number and quality; the number is great we ſee, yet we ſee not all who yet are the true Mourners, pouring out their ſouls to God with tears in their private cloſets.<lb/>

And if any prompted by <hi>Judas</hi> ſhall object againſt this Solemnity and prolixe ceremony, <hi>ut quid perdetio iſta?</hi> To what ſerves this waſt? might not the money have been better expended in charitable Alms, to the relief of very many poor. I anſwer in the words of our Saviour, <hi>Hac oportet facere, &amp; illa non omittere;</hi> Thoſe works of charity they ſpake of, ought to be done: and theſe of decent Rites and ceremonies not to be left undone: the rule of the Apoſtle, Let all things be done decently and in order, is a warrant as well for the due Exequies of the dead, as Obſequies of the living: if all things muſt be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and in order, in the State and Common-wealth, much more in the Church, whoſe emblem is, <hi>Acies ordinata,</hi> an Army marſhalled in excellent order, with Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners diſplayed; and if all things in the Church muſt be ſo carried, then Funerals as well as Nuptialls, Burials as well as Chriſtnings; and if ſo, then ought they to be celebrated not after the prepoſterous manner of ſome in the night as works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but in the day as works of Piety, in honour of them who have received the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of Saints in light, not penuriouſly and baſely, but nobly and liberally; where the quality of the dead requireth it, and the eſtate will bear it. Howbeit I confeſs, that as Magnificence is alwayes a vertue, ſo prodigallity is a vice; and one of thoſe maſter-vices which hath gotten a great head in his Kingdome, and a Garland upon it. Yet to do the dead right, though luxury be guilty of the death of many: yet the dead are no way guilty of this ſuperfluity, they neither order it, nor are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it; neither is the prodigallity (under the weighty burden whereof the Land groaneth) ſo much ſeen in black cloaths, as in Silks and Velvets, cloth of Gold and Tiſſue; not in Jet as in Pearl, and precious ſtones; not in building Marble Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for the dead, as Marble houſes for the living; not in armory, as in luxury; not in pendants, as in attendants; not in Funerals, as in Nuptials, Masks and Pageants, Court entertainments, and City feaſts, at which if <hi>Vitellius</hi> or <hi>Apicius</hi> were bidden, they would condemn themſelves for too much frugality. What <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpake of time, <hi>ſolus temporis prodigi ſumus, cujus unius honeſt a eſt avaritia,</hi> we arelaviſh of our time, of which covetouſneſs is only commendable; we may invert, and with truth confeſs, we are frugal for the moſt part in thoſe things (I mean the ſervice of the living God, and offices of piety to the dead) wherein not only bounty, but mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence alſo is moſt commendable. If any be otherwayes minded, and repine and grudge at this laſt honour to the dead, and comfort to the living; I ſhall uſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reproof of him at this preſent, then a like to that of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> recorded in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi>

So liberal a Patron he was, that he not only freely beſtowed all the Benefices that fell in his gift, but was alſo at all the charge of inſtitution, induction, compoſition, firſt-fruits, and whatſoever burthen fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Incumbent: Such patterns of Patrons, we may rather wiſh then hope for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; what ſhall I need to add more concerning him, whoſe birth was illuſtrious, his education liberal, his Patromony great, his Matches ſutable, his life exemplary, and his death comfortable? Single vertues we meet with in many, but ſuch combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as were in him, ſuch affability in ſuch gravity, ſuch humility in ſuch eminency, ſuch patience in ſuch trials, ſuch temperance and moderation in ſuch abundance, as we have juſt cauſe to bleſs God for in him, ſo we have great cauſe to pray for in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of his Rank. In his tender years he was ſet as a choice Plant in the famous Nurſey of good learning and Religion, the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where living as a Commoner in <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Colledge, under the care and tuition of Doctor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian Wenfield;</hi> he very much thrived and grew above his equalls both in grace and in knowledge, gaining to himſelf as much love, as learning. After he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from thence, he fell into very great troubles, as well before as after the death of his Father, but the Lord delivered him out of all: Theſe croſſes and afflictions ſerved but as Files to brighten thoſe gifts and graces in him, which ſhined afterwards moſt brightly in his more ſetled eſtate, and eminent employments, being choſen De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Lievetenant in <hi>Wiltſhire;</hi> Commiſſioner in three Shires, Four times High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Sheriff, and often Knight for the Shire in Parliament; in all which places of important negotiations and great truſt, he ſo carried himſelf, that all men might ſee in all his actions, he had a ſpecial eye to the Motto in his Eſcouchion, <hi>Jeay bonne cauſe,</hi> for with <hi>Mary</hi> he alwayes choſe the good part, and ſtood up for the truth, which he confirmed with his laſt breath. You have heard what he was in publick, but what was he in private? we have ſeen him in the Sun, how demeaned he himſelf in the ſhade? True, Religion is like the precious ſtone <hi>Garamantites,</hi> which caſteth no great luſtre outwardly, but <hi>ſemper intus habeat aureas guttus:</hi> but we may diſcern as it were golden drops within. Three of theſe after I have preſented to your view, I will then ſet free your patience, and give your ſorrow full ſcope to vent it ſelf in tears. The firſt of theſe was tenderneſs of conſcience, which is one of the moſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible tokens and marks of the Child of God; ſo tender was he, that he would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take no buſineſs before he was fully perſwaded of the lawfulneſs thereof, both by clear texts of Scripture, and the approbation of moſt learned and conſcientious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; he made ſcruple, not only of committing the leaſt known ſin, but of imbarking into any action which was queſtionable among thoſe that love the truth in ſincerity. And therefore, although God bleſſed him with great wealth, and ſtore of coyn, yet he never put it to Uſury or Intreſt thereby to increaſe it, for he held the tolleration of the Law in this Kingdome to be no ſufficient warrant for any violation of the divine Law, the deſtinctions lately coyned, of toothleſs and biting Uſury he no way allowed, judging truly, that all Uſury according to the Hebrew Etymology, is bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and hath not only teeth, but Adders teeth envenomed; for all Uſury if it bite not our Brother as <hi>per accidens</hi> ſometimes it may not, yet it biteth the conſcience of all ſuch who have any remorſe of ſin. The ſecond <hi>aurea gutta,</hi> was Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, whereby he took to heart the afflictious of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and miſery of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whoſe fores he cured with the moſt precious <hi>balſamum</hi> he could buy for his money. What <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth (lib. 32. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Attalus uſus eſt Thynni recentiores adipe ad ulcera</hi>) on the Fiſh in Latin <hi>Thynuus,</hi> that it is a ſoveraign remedy againſt many diſeaſes, and cureth all kind of ulcers, was truly verified in him; for he furniſhed himſelf with the beſt cordials and the rareſt medicinal receipts; and when he heard of any poor, ſick, or hurt; he not onely ſent them money, but <hi>Bezar,</hi> and <hi>balſamum,</hi> thinking nothing could coſt him too dear, whereby he might ſave the life, or recover the health of the pooreſt member of Chriſt Jeſus. In the years of death and ſickneſs, he ſent proviſion to all the Pariſhes about him, and thrice a week relieved a hundred at leaſt at his gate: neither did his compaſſion die with him, for in his Will and Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament confirmed by him the day before his Death, he bequeathed divers Legacies to <pb n="484" facs="tcp:47453:250"/>the poor, whereof theſe following came to my notice. To Saint <hi>Margarets</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> 10. pound. To <hi>Kempsford,</hi> 60. pound. To <hi>Coſley,</hi> 60. pound. To <hi>Froome,</hi> and the Woodlands, 100. pound. To <hi>Warmeſter,</hi> 100. pound. To <hi>Deverill,</hi> and <hi>Mounten,</hi> 100. pound. The laſt <hi>aurea gutta,</hi> which I ſhall preſent to your view at this time, was his ſervency of zeal for the truth of the Goſpel; in all the Benefices which he beſtowed, he took ſpecial care to make choice of men ſound in the Faith, no way warping either to Popiſh ſuperſtition, or ſchiſmatical ſeperation: as he made greateſt accompt of thoſe Miniſters of the Goſpel, who were ſervent in ſpirit, zealous for the truth; ſo he hated none more then temporizers, and luke-warm Loadiceans: he ſeldome ſpake of any Romaniſt without expreſſing a great deteſtation of their idolatry, and ſuperſtition: the night before he changed this life for a better, after an humble confeſſion of his ſins in general, and a particular profeſſion of the Articles of his belief, in which he had lived, and now was reſolved to die, he added, I renounce all Popiſh ſuperſtition, all mans merits, truſting only upon the merits of the Death and paſſion of my Saviour; and whoſoever truſteth on any other, ſhall find when he is dying, if not before, that he leaneth upon broken reeds. Here after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of his Wife and Children, being required by me to eaſe his mind; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, if any thing lay heavy upon his conſcience; he anſwered, nothing he thanked God; yet like an obedient child of his Mother, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> both hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſired, and received her abſolution: and now profeſſing that he was moſt willing to leave the world; he beſought all to pray for him; and himſelf prayed moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, that God would enable him patiently to abide his good will and pleaſure, and to go through this laſt and greateſt work of faith and patience: and the pangs of Death ſoon after coming upon him, he fixed his eyes on Heaven from whence came his help, and to the laſt gaſp, lifted up his hand, as it were, to lay hold on that Crown of righteouſneſs, which Chriſt reacheth out to all his children, who hold out the good fight of Faith to the end, and conquer in the end; Which crown of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Lord who hath purchaſed with his blood, after we have finiſhed likewiſe our courſes, of his infinite bounty beſtow upon us all. <hi>Cui, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, of the manner. When the Sun was ſetting, a deep ſleep and dreadful dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fell upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> and God ſhewed him in a dream, the miſery and thraldome of his poſtetity in Egypt: <hi>Know of a ſurety, that thy ſeed ſhall be a ſtranger in a land that is not theirs, and ſhall ſerve them, and they ſhall afflict them</hi> 400. <hi>years,</hi> verſ 13. and leſt at the ſight hereof his heart ſhould utterly have failed him, and his <hi>bowels dryed</hi> up within him like <hi>a pot-ſheard;</hi> God cleareth the skie which was clouded with a <hi>ſmoak of a fiery furnaſs,</hi> verſ. 17. and cheareth his heart, reviving him with a promiſe of ſafety, and peace for himſelf, and of deliverance of his poſterity alſo out of their grievous ſervitude, after a certain period of years allotted for the promiſe of the <hi>growth and ripeneſs of the Amorites ſins.</hi>

                  </note> the great Secretary of Nature diſcovereth unto us, that the Dreams of good men, are better than the Dreams of bad; and he will have his <hi>foelix</hi> or happy man, to have a ſingular priviledge above other men, even in his ſleep. And doubtleſs, as a good conſcience is a <hi>full feaſt in the day,</hi> ſo it is a light <hi>banquet</hi> in the night; for better thoughts, and phanteſies in the day, beget better dreams in the night: as the brighter colours in the Window, when the Sun ſhineth caſt clearer <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies intentionales,</hi> or reflections from them on the Wall. God is with his children, as well in the night, as in the day, and he imparts his counſels, and diſcloſeth his ſecrets, as well by dreams in the one, as by viſions in the other.

Thus have we viewed the form, let us now have an eye to the matter, our Lords conqueſt over Death, and the Grave. There are two things moſt dreadful to the nature of man, Death and the Grave, the one ſevereth the ſoul, the other conſumeth the body, and reſolveth it into duſt: the valianteſt conquerours that with their bloody flags and coulors, have ſtruck a terrour unto all Nations; yet have been afrighted themſelves at the diſplaying of the pale and wan coulours of Death: the moſt retired Philoſophers, and Monks, who have lived in Cells, and Caves under the ground: yet have been ſtartled at the ſight of their Grave. How much then are we indebted to our Chriſtian ſaith, that not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world, but alſo conquereth the fear of Death, and the grave, and dareth both in the words of my Text; <hi>O death, ſting me if thou canſt; O grave conquer me if thou be able; O death, where is thy ſting; O grave, where is thy victory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words the Apoſtle like a Cryer, calleth Death and the Grave into the Court, and <hi>examineth</hi> them upon two <hi>Articles,</hi> firſt concerning the <hi>ſting</hi> of the one, ſecondly concerning the <hi>victory</hi> of the other: Will it pleaſe you then to fix the eye of your obſervation upon the parts of this Text, as they are laid before you in terms of Law.

               <p>Firſt, for the manner of Citing, it is by an Apoſtrophe, a figure often accurring in holy Scripture, as in the book of Kings, <hi>O Altar, Altar, O ye mount ains of Gilboa,</hi> and of the Pſalmes; <hi>lift up ye gates, and be ye lift up you everlaſting doors:</hi> and of the Canticles, <hi>Ariſe O North, and blow O South;</hi> and in the Prophets, <hi>O earth, earth, earth.</hi> In imitation of which ſtrings of rhetorick the Auncient Fathers in their funeral Orations, many times turned to the dead, and uſed ſuch compellations as theſe, <hi>audi Conſtantine vale Paula, hear O Conſtantine, farewel O Paula.</hi> From which paſſages our adveſaries very weakly, if not ridiculouſly infers the invocation of Saints departed, making weapons of plumes of feathers, and arguments of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and which is far worſe, Divinity of rhetorick, and articles of faith, of tropes of ſentences. By a like conſequence, they might conclude that hills and trees, and the earth, and gates, and death, and hell have eyes to look upon us, or ears to hear us, or that we ought to invocate them; becauſe the holy Ghoſt maketh ſuch Apoſtrophes to them, as the Fathers do to the ſouls of Saints newly departed out of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Paſſively, <hi>where is thy ſting?</hi> that is the ſting thruſt out by Death; in which ſence the ſting of Death is no other then the preſent ſence of the deſert of death, and guilt of conſcience, and a dreadful expectation of damnation and hell to enſue upon it: take away this <hi>ſting</hi> from the death of the body, that it is a puniſhment for ſin, and an <hi>earneſt</hi> as it were of eternal death, and it can hurt no man. This ſting Chriſt hath plucked out of the death of all his Saints, and of a curſe, made it a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; of a torment, an eaſe; of a puniſhment of ſin, a remedy againſt all ſin; of a ſhort and fearful <hi>cut</hi> to eternal death, a fair and ſafe <hi>draw-bridge</hi> to eternal life.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Actively, <hi>where is thy ſting?</hi> that is the ſting which <hi>cauſeth and bringeth Death:</hi> In this ſence <hi>the ſting of death is ſin, non quem mors fecit ſed quo, mors facta eſt peccato enim morimur, non morte peccamus,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> moſt accutely and eloquently; Sin is ſaid to be the ſting of Death, as a cup of poiſon is ſaid to be <hi>a potion of death,</hi> that is, a potion bringing death, <hi>for we die by ſin; we ſin not by death, ſin is not the off-ſpring of death, but death the off-ſpring of ſin;</hi> or as the Apoſtle termeth it <hi>the wages of ſin.</hi> And it is juſt with God to pay the ſinner <hi>this wages,</hi> by rendring death to ſin, and puniſhing ſin with death: becauſe ſin ſevereth the ſoul from God, and not only grieveth and deſpightfully entreateth, but without repentance, in the end thruſteth the ſpirit out of doors: And what more agreeable to Divine juſtice, then that the ſoul which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſevereth her ſelf from God, ſhould be unwillingly ſevered from the body? and that the ſpirit ſhould be expelled of his reſidence in the fleſh, which expelleth Gods grace, and excludeth his Spirit from a reſidence in the ſoul? This <hi>ſting of death</hi> is like <pb n="499" facs="tcp:47453:257"/>the Adders, <hi>two forked</hi> or double; for it is either original or actual ſin; original ſin is the ſting of death,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.17. Rom: 5.12. Ezek: 18: 20.</note> 
                  <hi>in the day thon eateſt of the Tree of knowledge, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> and <hi>as by one man ſin came into the World, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſeth upon all men, for that all had ſinned.</hi> Secondly, actual ſin is the ſting of death; <hi>the ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die; the ſon ſhall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor the father the iniquity of the ſon, the righteouſneſs of the righteous ſhall be upon him, and the wickedneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon him.</hi> Howbeit, if we ſpeak properly, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin as it is a proneſs to all ſin, ſo it maketh us rather obnoxious to death, then dead men: but actual ſin without repentance, ſlayes out-right. <hi>Adam</hi> did not die the day he eat the fruit, but that day became <hi>mortalis,</hi> or <hi>morti obnoxius,</hi> guilty of death, or liable to it; original ſin alone maketh us <hi>mortes,</hi> but actual <hi>mortuos,</hi> dead men. The Devil like to a Hornet, ſometimes <hi>pricks</hi> us onely, but <hi>leaveth not his ſting in us,</hi> ſometime he leaveth <hi>his ſting in us,</hi> and thats far the more dangerous. He is pricked only with this ſting, who ſinneth ſuddenly and preſently repenteth: but he who the Devil bringeth to a habit or cuſtome in ſin, in him he <hi>leaveth his ſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we know what the ſting is, let us enquire where it is? The anſwer is, if we ſpeak of the reprobate men, or Devils, it remaineth in their conſciences; if we ſpeak of the Elect, it is plucked out of their ſouls, and it was put in our Saviours body, and there deaded and loſt, for <hi>he that knew no ſin, was made ſin for us,</hi> to wit, by imputing our ſin to him,

               <p>The firſt interrogatory is anſwered, we know where Deaths ſting is; let us now conſider of the ſecond interrogatory, concerning the victory of the Grave; <hi>O grave! where is thy victory?</hi> If the Grave, as ſhe openeth her mouth wide. ſo ſhe could ſpeak, ſhe would anſwer: My victories are to be ſeen in <hi>Macpelah, Golgotha;</hi> in all the gulphs of the Sea, and Caves and pits of the Earth, where the dead have been beſtowed ſince the beginning of the world. My victory is in the fire, in the water, in the earth, in all Churnels and Caemitaties, or dormitories, in the bellies of fiſh, in the maws of beaſts, in holy ſhrines, Tombs and ſepulchers, whereſoever corpſes have been put, and are yet reſerved.

Death ſaith, <hi>fear not me;</hi> the Grave, <hi>Weep not immorderately for the dead:</hi> Death bids us <hi>die to ſin:</hi> the Grave, <hi>Bury all thy injuries and wrongs in the pit of oblivion;</hi> both ſay to us, <hi>ſlie ſin, and neither of us can hurt you;</hi> both ſay to us, <hi>Give thanks to him, who hath given you victory over us both, the ſting of death pricks you not, but if you die in the boſome of Chriſt, rather delights and rickles you. Death is no more Death, but a ſleep; the Grave is no more a grave, but a bed.</hi> Death is but the putting off of our old <hi>rags,</hi> the Grave is the <hi>Veſtry;</hi> and the Reſurrection, the new <hi>dreſſing, and richly embroydering</hi> them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="500" facs="tcp:47453:258"/>Enough hath been ſaid to convince us, that Death which before was like a Serpent armed with a deadly ſting, is now but like a ſilly flie that buzzeth about us, but cannot ſting. Yet as long as there is ſin in us, we cannot but in ſome degree fear Death: and as long as natural affection remains in us, <hi>take on</hi> for them that are <hi>taken away.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Chriſtian religion pluck out theſe affections by the root, but only prune them. All that my exhortation driveth unto, is but to moderate paſſion by reaſon; fear by hope, grief by faith, and nature by grace: Let love expreſs it ſelf, yet ſo that in affection to the dead, we hurt not the living: Let the <hi>natural ſprings</hi> of tears <hi>ſwell,</hi> but not too much <hi>overflow</hi> their <hi>banks:</hi> let not our eyes be all upon our loſs on earth, but our brothers gain alſo in heaven, and let the one <hi>counter-ballance</hi> at leaſt, the other. The pariſh hath loſt a great ſtay, his company in <hi>London</hi> a ſpecial ornament, his Wife a careful Husband, her Children a moſt tender Father, the poor a good friend; for beſides that which his <hi>right hand gave</hi> in his life-time, which his <hi>left hand knew not of;</hi> by his Will he bequeathed certain ſums of money, for a ſtock to thoſe Pariſhes wherein he formerly lived, and to the poor of this, twenty pounds to be diſtributed at his Funeral. Many ſhall find loſs of him, but he hath gained God, and is found of him (no doubt) in peace,

O Grave where is thy victory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ſhall we ſay then hereunto? With ſubmiſſion to thoſe who out of better skill in the original, and upon more exact examination of all Tranſlations, may bring them to a better accord for the preſent, I thus reſolve.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that <hi>Rabbi Iarchi</hi> his tranſlation is utterly be to rejected; for it is like the <hi>white of an egg that hath no taſte:</hi> what ſenſe can any man pick out of theſe words <hi>ero verbo tua ô mors, I will be thy words O Death,</hi> unleſs we help them with our Engliſh phraſe, I <hi>will do thine errand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Aben-Ezra</hi> is to go packing with his fellow <hi>Rabbin,</hi> for his interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a manifeſt contradiction to the former words of the Prophet; <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death;</hi> he that will redeem them from death, can in no ſenſe be ſaid to be the cauſe why they die, but why they die not. Beſides both he and <hi>Iarchi</hi> ſtumble at the ſame ſtone, to wit the word <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borica,</hi> which they derive from <hi>dabar,</hi> ſignifying <hi>verbum</hi> or <hi>cauſa;</hi> whereas they ſhould have derived it from <hi>Dever</hi> ſignifying <hi>peſtem,</hi> or a plague.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> his tranſlation, though it differ ſomewhat from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, yet it is no Antitheſis to the Text, but an elegant Antanaclaſis, or at leaſt a Metonymie, <hi>generis pro ſpecie mors pro peſte, I will be thy death, for I will be thy plague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, for the tranſlation of the Septuagint, (which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> moſt ſeemeth to follow, becauſe writing to the Gentiles who made uſe of that tranſlation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the original, he would not give them any offence, nor derrogate from it, which was in great eſteem among all, in regard of the antiquity thereof; and it ſtood the Chriſtians in thoſe dayes in great ſtead to convince the unbelieving Jewes.) It well agreeth with the Analogie of faith, and the meaning of the holy Spirit, and the Hebrew letter alſo will bear it; for <hi>Ehi</hi> (as <hi>Buxtorphius</hi> the great Maſter of the holy tongue, out of <hi>David Kimchi</hi> obſerveth) ſignifieth <hi>ubi where,</hi> as well as <hi>ero I will be;</hi> and a <hi>venemous ſting,</hi> and <hi>peſtis</hi> the <hi>plague</hi> differ but little: ſo that although the words in the original ſeem to be ſpoken by an affirmation, but in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Septuagint, by an interrogation; in the one by a commination, in the other by an inſultation; yet both come to one ſenſe, and contain an evident propheſie of Chriſt his conqueſt over Death and Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have pluked away the thorn,</hi> and now I am come to <hi>blow the flower, and open the leaves of the words; O death I will be thy plauges,</hi> that is, <hi>I will take away from Death the power of deſtroying utterly; and from the Grave, the power of keeping the dead in it perpetually.</hi> If we take the words as ſpoken by way of inſultation, <hi>ô mors</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>O death where is thy ſting?</hi> thus we are to conſtrue them; as <hi>a hornet or ſerpent when his ſting is plucked out can do no hurt to any other, but ſoon after dyeth it ſelf; ſo Death is diſarmed by Chriſt and left as good as dead:</hi> for as <hi>David</hi> cut off <hi>Goliahs</hi> head with his own ſword, and <hi>Braſidas</hi> ran through his enemy with his own ſpear; ſo Chriſt conquers over Death by death; in as much as by his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death he ſatisfied both for the temporal and the eternal death of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him. And as he conquered Death by his death, ſo he deſtroyed the Grave by his burial; for ſuffering his body to be impriſoned, and afterwards breaking the gates and barrs of the priſon, he left the paſſage open to all his members to come out after him their head. Theſe ſacred and heavenly myſteries are <hi>ſhrined</hi> in the letter of this Text; for although the Prophet ſpeaketh to the Iſraelites, and maketh a kind of tender unto them of redemption from temporal death,

                  </note> and deliverance from corporal captivity; yet to confirm their faith therein he bringeth in the promiſe of eternal redemption, from whence they were to infer, <hi>if God will redeem us from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, how much more from temporal death; if he will deliver us out of the priſon of the grave, how much more out of common Goals?</hi> what though our enemies have never ſo great a hand over us, what though they exceed in their cruelty, and put us to all exttemity, and do their worſt againſt us; their cruelty cannot extend beyond death, nor their malice beyond the Grave: but Gods power and mercy reacheth farther. For he can, and he promiſeth that he will revive us after we are dead, and raiſe us after we are buried; he will pluck deaths ſting out of us, and us out of the bowels of the Grave. <hi>Death hath not ſuch power over the living, nor the grave over the dead, as God hath over both, to deſtroy the one, and ſwallow up the other into victory.</hi> For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Son of God vouchſafeth to <hi>taſte death,</hi> that Death might be <hi>ſwallowed up by him into victory.</hi> Although Death ſwallow up all things, and the Grave ſhut up all in darkneſs, yet God is above them both; therefore when we are brought to the greateſt exigent, when nothing but death and torments are before us, when we are ready to yeeld up the <hi>buckler of our faith,</hi> and breath out the laſt gaſp of hope, let us call this Text to mind; <hi>O death I will be thy plagues!</hi> neither Death nor the Grave ſhall be my peoples <hi>bane,</hi> becauſe I will be both their <hi>bane,</hi> and change their nature, which deſtroyeth all nature. For to all them that believe in me, Death ſhall not be a <hi>poſtern,</hi> but a <hi>ſtreet-door,</hi> not ſo much an <hi>out-let,</hi> of temporal, as an <hi>in-let</hi> of eternal life: and though the grave ſwallow the bodies of my Saints, yet it ſhall caſt them up again at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Thus the words yeeld us ſingular comfort, if we take them as a commination, and they afford us much or more, if we take them as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> do, <hi>by an inſultation. As a man offering ſacrifice for victory, and full of mirth and jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he leaps and tramples upon Death, lying as it were at his mercy, and ſings an Io Poean, a triumphant ſong;</hi> wherewith <hi>Gerardus</hi> a great friend of Saint <hi>Bernards,</hi> breathed out his laſt gaſp, of whom he thus writeth; <hi>In the dead time of the night my brother</hi> Gerard <hi>ſtrangely revived, at midnight the day began to break, I ſent for to ſee this great miracle found a man in the very Jaws of death, inſulting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death and exulting with joy,</hi> ſaying, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? Death is not now a ſting, but a ſong, for now the faithful man dyeth ſinging, and ſingeth dying.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>But there being divers kinds of death, which of them is here meant? Death is a privation, and privations cannot be defined, but by their habits; that is ſuch poſitive qualities, as they bereave us of; for inſtance, ſickneſs cannot be perfectly defined, but by health which it impaireth: nor blindneſs, but by ſight which it deſtroyeth: nor darkneſs, but by light which it excludeth: nor death, but by life which it depriveth us of.

                  <hi>and life was the light of men.</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> declareth it after this manner: <hi>Life dying contended with Death living, and got a glorious and ſignal victory.

               <p>Is Death thus diſcharged, hath Chriſt changed the nature of Death, and freed all his Members from the ſting of the temporal and fear of eternal death? hath he of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern made it a <hi>ſtreet-door,</hi> of an <hi>out-let</hi> of mortal life, an <hi>in-let</hi> of immortality? why then are we ſo much afraid of death, which can no more hurt us then a hornet or waſp after her ſting is plucked out? Chriſt fought with a living death, we with a dead death; which doth not ſo much ſever our ſouls from our bodies, as joyn them to Chriſt; not ſo much end our life as our mortality; not ſo much exclude us out of the Militant, as render us to the Triumphant Church. Nothing is more dreadful I confeſs to the natural man, then Death which diſſolveth the ſoul and body, and the Grave which reſolveth the body into duſt and aſhes.

                  <hi>Omnis caro foenum, &amp; omnis homo flos, All fleſh is graſs, and every man is a flower.</hi> There is difference in graſs, ſome is longer, and ſome is ſhorter; ſo ſome men are longer lived, ſome ſhorter; ſome graſs ſhooteth up with one leaf, ſome with three, ſome with five, or more: ſo ſome men have more in their Retinue, ſome fewer, ſome none at all. Some graſs withereth before it is cut, as the graſs on the houſe-top; ſome is cut before it withereth, as the graſs of the field: ſo ſome men decay before the <hi>Sythe of Death</hi> cuts them; all other after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="510" facs="tcp:47453:263"/>Likewiſe, there is a great difference among flowers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some are for ſight only, not for the ſmell, or any vertue in medicines; as <hi>Tulips, Emims,</hi> and <hi>Crown Emperials.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Some for ſight and ſmell, but of no uſe in Medicines; as <hi>Sweet-williams,</hi> the <hi>painted Lady,</hi> and <hi>July-flowers</hi> generally.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some are both for ſight and ſmell, and of ſingular uſe in Medicines, as <hi>Roſes</hi> and <hi>Violets.</hi> So ſome men are of better parts, and greater uſe in the Church and Common-wealth, others of leſs. Some flowers grow in the field, ſome in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: ſo ſome mens lives and imployments are publike, others private. Some flowers are put in Poſies, ſome in Garlands, ſome are caſt into the Still: ſo ſome men are better preferred them others, and ſome live and die in obſcurity.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſome flowers preſently loſe their colour and ſcent, as the <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> ſome keep them both long, as the <hi>red Roſe:</hi> So ſome men continue longer in their bloom, grace and favour; others for a ſhort time, but all-fade, and within a while are either gathered, cut down, or withered of themſelves and die. And for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is as I conceived, that we ſtick hearbs and flowers on the Hearſe of the dead, to ſignifie, that as we <hi>commit earth to earth, and aſhes to aſhes;</hi> ſo we <hi>put graſs to graſs and flowers to flowers.</hi> For, <hi>omnis caro foenum, All fleſh is graſs, and all the goodlineſs, thereof as the flower of the field, the graſs withereth, and the flower fadeth away;</hi> But the comfort is in that which followeth; <hi>But the word of the Lord endureth for ever, and this is the word which by the Goſpel is preached unto you;</hi> Whereof this verſe which I have read unto you for my Text, is part.</p>
               <p>Which Saint <hi>John</hi> inferreth as a concluſion or corrolary upon the concluſion of the Saints and Martyrs lives, this concluſion is inferred upon two premiſes.

<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.18.</note> but no true expoſition of this place; in which the latter ſeemeth to be a limitation of the former: as <hi>God is near to all that call upon him, yea, all that call upon him faithfully;</hi> ſo here, <hi>bleſſed are the dead,</hi> what all dead howſoever they die? no, <hi>but all that die in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is much variety, among the interpreters about the interpretation of this phraſe, to <hi>die in the Lord.</hi> Some will have the meaning thereof, to be thoſe that <hi>die for the Chriſtian faith, and ſeal the truth thereof with their bloud.</hi> And they alleage for themſelues, firſt parallel texts of Scripture, wherein the prepoſition <hi>in,</hi> is put for <hi>pro:</hi> for as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.13. <hi>Omnes in te benedicentur, all Nations ſhall be bleſſed in thee,</hi> that is for thee, and <hi>in thy ſeed,</hi> that is, for thy ſeed; and <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.18. <hi>ſervivi Berachel,</hi> word for word, I <hi>ſerved in Rachel,</hi> that is for <hi>Rachel.</hi> Next they alleage the antecedents, together with the occaſion of theſe words verſe 12. <hi>here is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the Saints, here are they that keep the commandements of God, and the faith of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and truly the main ſcope of the Text ſeemeth to be, to arm the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with patience, and to encourage them to fight againſt the Beaſt, upon whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God execute vengeance, if it ſo fall out that many of Gods faithfull ſervants looſe their lives: Yet that none ſhould be diſmayed therewith, becauſe all that ſo die are bleſſed, for they exchange a temporal life in this World, for an eternal in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thirdly ſay they, it cannot be well conceived how any can die, <hi>in Domino, in the Lord, who is the Lord of life,</hi> if we take the prepoſition in the proper ſence: for though in the natural body a member may be cut off and die, the head being alive; <pb n="514" facs="tcp:47453:265"/>yet it is not ſo in the myſtical body of Chriſt, no true Member thereof can be cut off, much leſs die, while it continues in that body, by dying in the Lord, therefore we muſt underſtand dying for the Lord, <hi>ſo they.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others will have the words not to be reſtrained to Martyrs only, but to belong to all that die in the fear of God, and the faith of Chriſt. And they alledg for themſelves alſo a parallel Text;
<note place="margin">1 Cor: 15.18.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.18. where to fall a <hi>ſleep in the Lord,</hi> is ſpoken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of all true believers departing this life.

<note place="margin">But <hi>è contra,</hi> all that die for the Lord, die in the Lord, So Martyrs, are not excluded though they are not included alone, but all true confeſſors with them.</note> and their works follow them.

All that die for the Lord, die alſo in the Lord; but all that die in the Lord, do not neceſſarily die for the Lord: we deny not that the Martyrs have the greateſt ſhare in this bleſſedneſs, but all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors have their parts alſo: the Martyrs Crown is beſet with a Rubie or ſome richer jewel then ordinary, their Garland hath a flower or two more in it, to wit ſome red flower as well as white; yet the Crown and Garland of all Confeſſors are compleat.

               <p>To ſtrike ſayl and make towards the ſhoar, if all that die in the Lord are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, from the very moment of their death, and this bleſſedneſs is confirmed by a voyce from heaven: let us give more heed to ſuch a voyce, then to any whiſper of the fleſh or devil. Whatſoever Philoſophy argueth, or Reaſon objecteth, or ſenſe excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt it: let us give more heed to God then man, to the ſpirit then the fleſh, to faith then to reaſon, to heaven then to earth; although they who ſuffer for the teſtimony of the Goſpel ſeem to be moſt miſerable, their skins being fleyed off, their joynts racked, their whole body torn in pieces, or burned to aſhes; their goods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate, their arms defaced, and all manner of diſgraces put upon them: yet they are moſt happy in heaven, by the teſtimony of heaven it ſelf, the malice of their enemies cannot reach ſo high as heaven, it cannot touch them there, much leſs awake them out of their ſweet ſleep in Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the dead are bleſſed in compariſon of the living: let us not ſo glue our thoughts, and affections to the world, and the comforts thereof, but that they may be eaſily ſevered, for there is no compariſon between the eſtate of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this life, and in the life to come; for here they labour for reſt, there they reſt from their labour: here they expect what they are to receive, there they receive what they expected: here they hunger and thirſt for righteouſneſs, there they are ſatisfied;
<note place="margin">Apoc. 7.17.</note> here they are continually afflicted, either for their ſins, or with their ſins, and they have continual cauſe to ſhed tears, either for the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Gods people, or the ſtroaks they themſelves receive from God, or the wounds they give themſelves; <hi>there all tears are wiped from their eyes.</hi> Here they <pb n="516" facs="tcp:47453:266"/>are alwayes troubled,

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>inciſion</hi> is already made, by the wounds given Chriſt at his death many <hi>inciſions</hi> were made in the <hi>true Vine:</hi> that which putteth us in, or <hi>inoculateth</hi> us, is a ſpecial faith, and that which binds us faſt to the tree, is love and the grace of perſeverance. If then we be <hi>engrafted</hi> by faith into Chriſt, and <hi>bound faſt</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by love, we ſhall partake of the <hi>Juice</hi> of the ſtock, and <hi>grow</hi> in grace, and bear <hi>fruit</hi> alſo more and more, and ſo living in the true Vine, we ſhall die in him, and ſo dying in him, we ſhall <hi>reflouriſh</hi> with him in everlaſting glory.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if we are aſſured by a <hi>voyce from heaven,</hi> that none but they are bleſſed, who <hi>die in the Lord:</hi> all Infidels, Jewes, and Turks; yea and ſuch hereticks too as deny all <hi>ſpecial faith</hi> in Chriſt are in a wretched and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able caſe; for it is clear that unbeleevers cannot live in Chriſt, for the <hi>juſt liveth by faith,</hi> and though hereticks, and among them our Adverſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> have a general faith, yet becauſe they want a ſpecial faith in Chriſt whereby they are to be <hi>ingrafted</hi> into him, and made members of his myſtical body, they can make no proof to themſelves or others, (at leaſt unleſs they renounce ſome of the <hi>Trent</hi> Articles) that they live, or <hi>die in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, if all that die in Chriſt are bleſſed, as a voyce from heaven aſſureth us,
<note place="margin">Apoc. 7.13.</note> we do wrong to heaven, if we account them miſerable: we do wrong to Chriſt, if we count them as loſt whom he hath found; if we ſhed immoderate tears for them from whoſe eyes <hi>He hath wiped away all tears;</hi> to wear perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual blacks for them, upon whom he hath <hi>put long white robes.</hi> Whatſoever our loſſes may be by them, it cometh far ſhort of their gain: our croſs is <hi>light,</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of their <hi>ſuper-excellent weight of glory;</hi> therefore let us not <hi>ſorrow for them, as thoſe that have no hope:</hi> Let us not ſhew our ſelves Infidels by too much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the death of beleevers.

fear. As after a great feaſt at which a man hath glutted his appetite, nothing remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but loathſome and ſtinking fumes- aſcending from the ſtomack to the head, and offending the brain; ſo of all the pleaſures of ſin paſt, nothing remaineth but a <hi>bitter taſt in the conſcience,</hi> or rather to uſe Saint <hi>Bernards</hi> Metaphor, <hi>amar a &amp; foeda veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, foul and ſtinking prints</hi> left in the <hi>floar</hi> where he danced <hi>after the Devils pipe;</hi> ſorrow and ſhame for what he hath been, and fear for what he ſhall be, <hi>mingles and ſours</hi> all the joy and delight in that he is. And what is he at the beſt? a poor tennent at will of a ruinous cottage of <hi>loam,</hi> or <hi>houſe of clay</hi> ready to fall about his ears, with a Graſhoppers leap in a ſpot of ground. His apparel is but ſtoln raggs, his wealth the excrements of the earth, his dyet, <hi>bread of carefulneſs,</hi> got with the <hi>ſweat of his brows,</hi> and all his comforts and recreations, rather as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> tearms them, <hi>ſolatia miſerorum quam gaudia beatorum, ſauces of miſery then diſhes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</hi> For albeit a <hi>good conſcience be a continual feaſt,</hi> and the teſtimony of the Spirit an everlaſting Jubilee in the ſoul, yet the moſt righteous man that breaths mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ayr, either by frailty, or negligence, or diffidence, or impatience, or love of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, or ſuttlety of perſwaſions, or violence of temptations ſo woundeth his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and <hi>grieveth the Spirit of grace;</hi> that this <hi>feaſt</hi> is turned for a time into a <hi>faſt,</hi> and the Jubilee into an ejulate or howling. All things therefore laid together, the ſcorns of the World, aſſaults from the fleſh, temptations from the Devil, rebukes from God, checks from conſcience, ſenſible failing of Grace, ſpiritual diſſertions, with many a bitter agony and conflict with deſpair; I cannot but perfectly accord with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et in his doleful note<lb/>

               </p>
               <p>But to leave other ſprings, this in my Text affordeth ſtore of water to extinguiſh Purgatory ſire; and therefore our adverſaries ſeek to dam it up two manner of wayes: Firſt by reſtraining this Text to Martyrs onely, who die in the Lords quarrel, though their ſouls flie to heaven, their wings being not ſinged with this fire: yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (ſay they) are not ſaved, but after ſome time of abode in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by cooling the heat of this fire, and making it not only tollerable, but alſo comfortable, bearing us in hand that they that are in Purgatot may be ſaid to be bleſſed, becauſe they reſt from the labours of this life, and they are ſecure of their eternal eſtate, they are ſure to feel no other hell. From the firſt ſtarting-hole I have bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them already, by demonſtrating, that all that beleeve in Chriſt are ingrafted by faith into his myſtical body, and conſequently, that as they live in him, ſo they die in him; in which regard the Apoſtle ſpeaking of all that depart in the faith of Chriſt ſaith, <hi>they ſleep in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>die in Chriſt.</hi> Their ſecond ſtarting-hole is leſs ſafe then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for to ſay that this bleſſedneſs and Purgatory pains may ſubſiſt in the ſame ſoul, is an affertion neither politique nor reaſonable. Firſt it is not politique; for if they cool Purgatory fire in ſuch ſort, they will ſtop the <hi>Popes Mint from going;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the vulgar that the ſouls in Purgatory are in a tollerable, nay (in ſome ſort) in a bleſſed eſtate, becauſe <hi>they reſt from their labours and their works follow them;</hi> and the Prieſts may ſet their heart at reſt for gaining any remarkable ſums for Dirges, and the Popes tole-gatherers alſo for ſucking any great advantage out of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons to ranſome ſouls out of Purgatory.</p>
               <p>And as this anſwer ſtandeth not with their profit: ſo neither agreeth it well with their own tenents; for they teach that Purgatory fire is as hot as Hell for the time, ſurpaſſing the ſmarteſt torment that can be deviſed, or ever was endured on earth and call they thoſe happy who lie ſoultring in this fire? yea, but when they are there they receive ſingular comfort in this, that they are ſure they ſhal never go to hell. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmall comfort to one who is in helliſh torments and ſhall continue there he knows not how long, to tell him that he is ſure he ſhall go to no other Hell: and how prove they that Purgatory is a ſuperſedeas to Hell? What ſecurity have they for it? Gods Word? but in all Gods Word there is no ſyllable of purgatory, neither let they the people to know Gods Word; for in <hi>Spain,</hi> and generally where the inquiſition is in force, the proverb is, that he <hi>ſmels of a Faggot, who is found with a Bible about him in the mother tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things being ſo I wonder that any ordinary Papiſt be willing to die, ſeeing the beſt he can hope for is to be caſt preſently into the flames of Purgatory, and there to fry he knows not how long, perhaps a hundred, perhaps a thouſand years.</p>
               <p>But (God be bleſſed for it) we have otherwiſe learned of Chriſt and his bleſſed Apoſtles. <hi>We know that if our earthly tabernacle be diſſolved, we ſhall preſently have</hi> not a temporary habitation in Purgatory, but <hi>an eternal in Heaven:</hi> we know, that <hi>thoſe who beleeve in Chriſt come into no condemnation, but paſs from death to life.</hi> Wherefore let us not <hi>take on</hi> too much for thoſe whom God hath taken away from us;

               </p>
               <p>The firſt difficulty is thus expedited: the works of the dead are here diſtinguiſhed from their labours, as the fruit from the branches that bear them, the hire from the day labour, the prize from the race. As thoſe who taſte the fruit of a tree, are ſaid by an Hebraiſme to eat of the tree, <hi>to him that overcometh,</hi> (ſaith the Spirit) <hi>I will give to eat of the Tree of Life which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God.</hi> So here in this Text works are taken for the fruit of works, or their recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>But how are works in this ſence ſaid to follow <hi>the dead?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond difficulty.</note> For all the works of the dead are either tranſient, as meditations, prayers, pious ejaculations, preſent relieving the poor, and the like; or, they are permanent as their writings, their building Colledges, Hoſpitals, Churches and other Monuments of Piety: the former cannot follow the dead becauſe they remain not now, nor the latter, becauſe they ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them here on earth.

<note place="margin">The third diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</note> whither the works follow the dead? which may thus be expedited: their good works follow them not to the grave; for there the ſoul is not, nor to Purgatory, for I have already proved there is no ſuch place; nor to Hell, for none are bleſſed that come there. The works of the damned indeed follow them thither; there they meer with them, and with the Devil who ſeduced them, to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them for them; there the ſwearers and blaſphemers gnaw their tongues; there the laſcivious wantons are caſt into a bed of fire; there they who ſwum here in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, are thrown into a river of brimſtone.

<note place="margin">Math. 25.34.35.</note> and partly by the body follow them at the day of Judgment. <hi>When the King ſhall ſay, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, poſſeſs the king dome prepared for you; for I was hungry, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was naked, and ye cloathed me; I was ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me.</hi>

               <p>There are infinite motives in holy Scriptures to incite us to good works, I will touch at this time only upon three.

Her life was well known to moſt of this place, and her death was every way anſwerable to her life: all that viſited her in her ſickneſs might behold with ſorrow a pittiful anatomy of frail mortality, and yet with joy a perfect pattern of Chriſtian patience, and a heavenly converſation: and though ſhe were full of divine conceptions, and ſhe had a ſpring by her of the waters of life, in the devotion of her deareſt helper, eſpecially in the beſt things: yet when I came to her, ſhe deſired ſhe might be <hi>partaker of ſome of my meditations</hi> (they were her own words) and when I prayed with her, and for her; ſhe joyned not ſo much with me, with her tongue, as her affections, and anſwered more in ſighs and tears, then in words: often ſhe complained of her tuff heart that would not yeeld to her diſſolution, and long, long ſhe thought it, till ſhe ſhould come <hi>to appear before the God of Gods in Sion.</hi> Her laſt words were, <hi>ſweet Father help me,</hi> and ſhe had her requeſt, for preſently he helped her both by the zealous, and moſt feeling prayers of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and by the holy ſpirit aſſiſting her in her own <hi>prayers with ſighs and groans that cannot be expreſſed,</hi> and immediately her <hi>ſweet Father</hi> releaſed her of her pangs, and received her to himſelf on his own day: On the Lords day morning, <hi>before the morning watch,</hi> I ſay, <hi>before the morning watch</hi> ſhe entered into her reſt, and began to keep her <hi>everlaſting Sabbath</hi> in heaven, where ſhe reapeth what ſhe ſowed, and ſeeth what ſhebelieved, and enjoyeth what ſhe hoped for, and is now entred into thoſe joyes, which never entred fully into the heart of any living on earth, nor ſhall into ours, <hi>till we with her be made perfect,</hi> and all of us come to <hi>Mount Sion, and the heavenly Jeruſalem, and innumerable company of Angels, and to the Congregation of the firſt-born,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words they afford to us a comfortable and ſweet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to be converſant in. From the ſixt verſe of this Chapter is ſet down to us the confirmation of the whole Propheſie and Book of the <hi>Revelation;</hi> partly by the affirmation of God, as likewiſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and of <hi>John</hi> himſelf, that heard and ſaw all theſe things; and likewiſe of the Church of God in <hi>verſe</hi> 17. It is likewiſe confirmed by the promiſe of Bleſſing and Happineſs, pronounced upon them that ſhall do all theſe things, and ſhall faithfully expect the accompliſhment of them. This Verſe (a part of which I have read to you) is the Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in few words of all that matter that goeth before, from <hi>verſe</hi> 6. to it; and hath in it:</p>
               <p>Firſt, an atteſtation of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, in the former part of the Verſe; <hi>Behold I come quickly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="528" facs="tcp:47453:272"/>Secondly, an acclamation of the Church, in the latter part, theſe words I have read to ye; <hi>Amen, even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the atteſtation of Chriſt, he promiſeth he will come to his Church, he will come ſhortly, both for the accompliſhment of all his promiſes, and likewiſe for their ſafety and deliverance from all enemies, and all miſeries, and moleſtations whatſoever. To this the Church makes an acclamation, and ſaith, <hi>Amen, even ſo come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this acclamation of the Church (to which we muſt now come) we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the perſon of the Speaker, whoſe words they be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what is the matter or ſubſtance contained in them.</p>
               <p>Ye ſhall ſee whoſe words they be, if ye look back but to the 17. verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there ye ſhall find, that firſt it is ſaid, <hi>the Spirit ſaith, Come.</hi> By the Spirit is not meant the third Perſon in Trinity the holy Ghoſt, becauſe he is not ſubject to theſe paſſions, to theſe deſires, but he reſteth himſelf in the execution and preſent diſpoſing and diſpenſing of things, according to his own will and pleaſure. Neither by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit here is meant any wicked ſpirit or Angel, for they do with fear and horrour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the ſame coming of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt; becauſe his coming ſhall be the accompliſhment of their miſery and eternal infelicity. But by Spirit here is meant, the ſpirit in all the Elect and holy people of God; in whomſoever the Spirit of God is, that Spirit doth ſay, <hi>come,</hi> and doth wiſh the accompliſhment of all theſe moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes, For this is not the deſire of the fleſh, or of nature; but an earneſt and vehement deſire of the Spirit of God in the Elect, that ſaith, <hi>come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again ſecondly, the ſame verſe telleth us, that the <hi>Bride ſaith, come.</hi> That is, the Church of God in general, the Catholick Church, the whole Church of God, being now hand-faſted to Chriſt, and entred into a ſpiritual contract with him; She deſireth the conſumation of the Marriage, the ſolemniation of the Marriage which is already begun in the contract of it; and not only every particular member of the Church in whom the Spirit of God is, <hi>ſaith come;</hi> but the Church of God in general, the <hi>Bride ſaith come,</hi> the whole Church ſaith <hi>come;</hi> wiſhing and deſiring the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Marriage which is already begun.</p>
               <p>In the third place, the ſame verſe telleth us, that as the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Bride</hi> ſay, <hi>come,</hi> ſo he that heareth ſaith, <hi>come;</hi> that is, not only the Church of God that is now preſent here upon the face of the earth, but the ſucceſſive parts of the Church in all future Ages; they are all of the ſame mind, having received the ſame Spirit, they all ſay <hi>come.</hi> Whoſoever heareth this Propheſie, whoſoever heareth of theſe promiſes in any Age or Country of the World, all they having the ſame ſpirit, they muſt needs ſay <hi>come, he that heareth, ſaith come,</hi> he that is acquainted with the promiſes, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the knowledge of them, and doth mingle them with the faith of his ſoul, this man muſt needs ſay, <hi>come,</hi> to the accompliſhment of them.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, <hi>He that is a thirſt ſaith, come too;</hi> that is, whoſoever hath taſted of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt in any meaſure whatſoever, and thereby hath wrought in him a vehement thirſt after more, this man will ſay, <hi>come.</hi> Whoſoever hath ſuch a ſenſe of Chriſt in his promiſes, as to taſte of the ſweetneſs of theſe never ſo little; as he that hath taſted a drop of hony wiſheth for more, ſo he that hath taſted of the ſweetneſs of Chriſt, a drop of his grace and mercy, this ſetteth upon his ſpirit a heavenly thirſt, he ſaith <hi>come,</hi> he would have more, he is never quiet till he have the promiſe accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. Theſe are the perſons, every particular member of the Church that hath the Spirit; the whole Church in general, not only the particular part of the Church now in the World or in any Age, but the ſeveral parts of the Church in ſeveral Ages; whoſoever is a thirſt, that hath taſted of Chriſt, muſt needs ſay, <hi>come. Even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi> Theſe are the perſons.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing, is the matter of this acclamation of the Church. Firſt the matter contained in it, it is a vehement and earneſt deſire of the people of God after Chriſts moſt happy return, in theſe words, <hi>Amen, even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi> The matter of it therefore is either infolded and implicite in the word <hi>Amen, even ſo,</hi> or unfolded and explicite in the latter words, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="529" facs="tcp:47453:272"/>It is infolded I ſay in the word <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3.14.</note> This word ſignifieth in the Scripture, either the Author of the truth himſelf, or elſe it is an affirmation of the truth.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Revelation, thus ſaith the Amen, the faithful and true witneſs;</hi> here Chriſt himſelf is called <hi>Amen,</hi> becauſe he is the Author of all truth and verity, the faithful and true witneſs.</p>
               <p>Sometime this word is uſed, and moſt frequently in Scripture, for the affirmation of the truth, either witneſſing of the truth, or wiſhing the truth.</p>
               <p>For the witneſſing of the truth, as in all thoſe vehement ſpeeches of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Amen, Amen, I ſay unto ye;</hi> or <hi>verily, verily, I ſay unto ye:</hi> this is a vehement aſſeveration and a witneſſing to the truth, which a man ought to believe, or would have to be believed.</p>
               <p>Or otherwiſe for a wiſhing and earneſt deſiring of the truth to be accompliſhed. So in the concluſion of the Lords prayer, and all our prayers, we add this word, <hi>Amen,</hi> that is, <hi>ſo be it,</hi> or <hi>Let it be ſo:</hi> we wiſh it with earneſtneſs of affection and deſire; and with a confidence and faith of our hearts, we hope and believe that this ſhall be ſo. This is that we profeſs when we ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this place, this word is uſed both for affirmation, and witneſſing of the truth; and likewiſe it is a vehement wiſh and deſire of the accompliſhment of theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with an earneſt and certain hope and expectation of faith, that all theſe promiſes and good things ſhall be accompliſhed to the ſoul of a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Again, the matter of this Acclamation is unfolded, and explained in the latter words, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus.</hi> Where there is both the Action, and the perſon to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
               <p>The Action, <hi>Come.</hi> Chriſt cometh to his Church many wayes. He cometh in his Word; He cometh in his Spirit; He cometh in his mercies. He cometh in his Judgments and Juſtice. None of theſe are here meant.</p>
               <p>But he cometh to his Church in perſon and appearance, even in the appearance of his body and humane nature. Thus Chriſt cometh two wayes to his Church in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Firſt in his Incarnation, he appeareth to the world in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, he came in humility, he came to ſuffer, to die. That is not here meant, for that was paſt, when as the Evangeliſt Saint <hi>John</hi> wrote this propheſie.</p>
               <p>But the Second coming in perſon of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, is his coming in the fleſh in glory, in exaltation to judge the quick and the dead, to ſhew himſelf a mighty God from heaven. This is the coming which is here meant, Chriſts ſecond coming to Judgment in glory. That is the Action.</p>
               <p>The perſon, is deſcribed by theſe two Titles; <hi>Lord: Jeſus.</hi> Wherein the Church deſireth that he may come both as a <hi>Lord,</hi> and as a <hi>Jeſus.</hi> That he may come as a Lord to vindicate the Church, and revenge him upon his enemies, to deſtroy the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkneſs, the kingdome of the Devil, the kingdome of Antichriſt, which hath been a great argument in this book of the Revelation.</p>
               <p>And not only come thus as a <hi>Lord,</hi> but as a <hi>Jeſus</hi> to ſave his Church, to vouchſafe to her, comfort and peace, and joy; that he would come to cloath her with immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and glory, which ſhe cannot expect on earth in a mortal ſtate. This is the ſum and ſubſtance of this Petition and requeſt, that the Lord would come in majeſty and glory, both as a Lord, againſt the enemies of the Church to deſtroy them utterly: and as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> to beſtow upon the Church, even all ſaving mercies, eſpecially that great mercy of everlaſting bleſſedneſs, that is not mixed with ſin and corruption, that is not mixed with any infirmity and defect whatſoever. This is the ſum and ſubſtance of the Text which I have in few words ſhortly explained to ye.</p>
               <p>Whence the point I obſerve (wherein we will inſiſt by the grace of God at this time) is this.<lb/>
                  <hi>That it is the nature and property of every true member of the Church of God, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and longingly to deſire the ſecond coming of Chriſt for the full redemption of his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Spirit ſaith, Come, and the Bride ſaith, Come; and whoſoever heareth ſaith,</hi> 
                  <pb n="530" facs="tcp:47453:273"/>
                  <hi>Come; whoſoever is a thirſt ſaith, Come:</hi> therefore every godly man that hath the Spirit of God, that is a part of this Bride, that is partaker of thoſe promiſes, that hath a caſte of Jeſus Chriſt, every one of theſe muſt neceſſarily ſay, <hi>Come; Even ſo, Come Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is ſo proper to believers, and to every one of them, as they are all of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by this property in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>The Crown which the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, and not only to me, but to all them that love his appearing.</hi> The Apoſtle he might have ſaid to all ſaints, and godly whatſoever; and to all faithful believers, but he makes choyce of this Epithite, he deſcribeth them by this, that they are ſuch as love his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>Unto them that wait for him ſhall he appear the ſecond time for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The godly are there deſcribed by this very property, they wait, and long, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after his appearance the ſecond time.</p>
               <p>In the 24. of Saint <hi>Mathews</hi> Goſpel; it is made the property of a good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant there, that he waiteth for his Maſters coming, and prepareth all things in a readineſs, it is oppoſed to the ſloathful ſervant that doth clean otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Ye ſee the truth of it in Scripture.</p>
               <p>But ye will ſay; Is this the property of the Elect and faithful? Do not ungodly men and ſinners believe the coming of Chriſt, and that he ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead? Doth not every man make this profeſſion of his faith; <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come to Judge the quick and the dead?</hi> Why then do ye make it the property of Believers, ſince every man believeth and looks for it?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer. There is a twofold expectation of Chriſt his return to Judgment.</p>
               <p>The one; An expectation with deſire, and with an earneſt longing, the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithful, of a <hi>Lord,</hi> of a gracious Redeemer, nay, of a loving Husband. Therefore every faithful ſoul cannot but wait upon him; As a faithful ſervant that hath done his work longeth for his Maſters coming home, that he may give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his faithfulneſs, and may be acceptable to his Maſter for his faithful ſervice that he hath done in his abſence, that he may expect his Maſters remuneration.</p>
               <p>But there is another expectation of Chriſt to come, that is not with deſire, but with horrour, and dread, and fear, out of guiltineſs of Conſcience. This is the expectation of a Malefactor in the Jayl, he waiteth and looks for the coming of the Judge to paſs ſentence on him, and ſo to be dragged to execution; thus wicked men expect Chriſt; thus wicked Angels expect him. But the expectation of the godly is an expectation with love and deſire, an expectation not of a ſevere Judge, but of a loving husband, of a faithful Maſter that hath promiſed a recompence to the ſervice of believers, even the leaſt and loweſt; if it be the gift of a cup of cold water in his name. Therefore ye muſt take knowledg of the expectation here meant; this I ſay is proper to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee the truth of the Doctrine, in the Reaſon of it; why every faithful ſoul muſt needs long and deſire the ſecond coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is a part of Chriſts gracious promiſe, which the faith of the ſoul leaneth on. The proper object of faith is the promiſe of the Goſpel, this ye may ſee in the Text, Chriſt had promiſed to come, <hi>Amen, even ſo;</hi> here is the reaſon of this deſire, becauſe his promiſe goeth before it. The faithful ſoul apprehendeth every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferiour promiſe, and every leſs promiſe, much more this main promiſe, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knot of all, the very complement of all: faith muſt needs expect and claſp faſt hold upon this promiſe, and give aſſent and acclamation to it, as in the word <hi>Amen, even ſo come</hi> as thou haſt ſaid and promiſed.</p>
               <p>Many promiſes to this purpoſe, hath our Lord and Saviour Chriſt pronounced, for the ſtirring up of our faith and affection; as namely that in the 14 of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel toward the beginning, where he comforteth his Diſciples in his abſence; <hi>If I go, I will come again.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. <hi>As ye ſee him aſcend with your bodily eyes</hi> in his Perſon and fleſh, <hi>ſo ye ſhall ſee him deſcend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we need not go far for promiſes, for immediately before the words, &amp; two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes beſides in this Chapter, the 7. and 12, <hi>Behold, I come ſhortly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="531" facs="tcp:47453:273"/>This is the property of every godly man having the promiſe of the coming, to lean upon it, and to deſire the accompliſhment of the promiſe. In the old Teſtament they had the promiſe of the firſt coming of Chriſt, that they earneſtly deſired; as <hi>Jacob</hi> Gen. 49.18 <hi>Lord I have waited for thy ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>Abraham ſaw Chriſts day afar off, and rejoyced.</hi> And in the New Teſtament we read of <hi>Anna,</hi> and <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the faithful <hi>that wait for the conſolation of Iſrael:</hi> they waited for the accompliſhment of this promiſe, the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, his firſt coming. Shall they wait, and earneſtly deſire the firſt coming of the Son of God in humility, and humanity and baſeneſs? and ſhall not we earneſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his ſecond coming in glory, to manifeſt not only his glory, but our glory? ſhall not we expect that coming of his, wherein we ſhall be married to himſelf, and whereby we ſhall be took up to himſelf? Thus ye ſee the promiſe of Chriſt is one ground, yea, and a principal ground of this expectation of the faithful.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon is drawn from the Union and conjunction between Chriſt and the faithful ſoul. That is in the Text too, <hi>the Bride ſaith, Come.</hi> Now there is a neer union and conjunction, in this ſame conjunction of Marriage among men wherein the love muſt needs be imperfect, and but a drop of that Ocean, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the love of the parties muſt needs be ſinful, yet notwithſtanding we ſee how vehement it is, in the abſence of one another; the one longeth and pineth after the other, and one party enjoyeth not himſelf without the other. Much more ought it to be ſo here in this heavenly contract between Chriſt and his faithful Spouſe: ſhould not hear the Spouſe be <hi>ſick of love?</hi> as the Spouſe profeſſeth of her ſelf in the ſecond of <hi>Canticles.</hi> This vehement deſire muſt needs ariſe out of the neerneſs and undevidedneſs of that conjunction that is between Chriſt and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. There is little love, where there is little deſire of the thing beloved, when it is abſent. Why doth the member of the Body, deſire immediate conjunction with the head, but becauſe it knows that the ſeperation from the head, is the death of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber? So it is in this neer conjunction between Chriſt the head, and his members the Church, they muſt needs deſire immediate, and inſeparable conjunction with the head, becauſe the ſeperation from the head, muſt be the death of the members. That is the ſecond Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The third Reaſon of the Point is this, becauſe the Saints of God they know that the accompliſhment of the full happineſs of the Church of God, and likewiſe of themſelves that are members of the Church, it conſiſteth in this, in Chriſt his ſecond coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to judgment, therefore they do earneſtly deſire it, and effect it, and ſay, <hi>Amen, even ſo, Come:</hi> becauſe (I ſay) they know this is the coming that perfects the Church of God, perfects their glory in the ſtate of happineſs, which the Church and every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof doth expect: they know that that is the time which ſhall be the <hi>Revelation of the ſons of God,</hi> who are here obſcure, and ſhall be till that day come. They know well that all the graces and perfections that the child of God can attain to in this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; all is but the firſt fruits, all is but a taſte, and therefore they cannot poſſibly but lift up their heads, and raiſe up their hearts to the expectation of that day wherein theſe firſt fruits ſhall be perfected, with <hi>full meaſure ſhaken together, and running over;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there ſhall be an abſolute freedome from all ſin, and from all the appurtenances of it: an abſolute perfection not of grace only, but of glory, which is the higheſt grace. They ſhall be one with the head, this is that which makes them look for it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. (the place I named before) it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt ſhall appear to ſave them that wait for him.</hi> He ſhall bring a full horn of ſalvation, he ſhall perfect the ſalvation of the Saints; till that day there is no perfection in the ſalvation of the Saints; No, though they go to heaven, yet before that day there is no perfect ſalvation, becauſe their bodies are not joyned to their ſouls. This is a third Reaſon, even the expectation of the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of all the promiſes. The Lord hath dealt with us as he dealt with his own Iſrael in their wilderneſs, he gave them a taſte of the fruit of the good land; he cauſed the ſearchers to carry ſome cluſters and bunches of the fruit to the Iſraelites in the Wilderneſs, that they taſting of it might hie themſelves to that rich and goodly, and fat countrey: ſo the Lord giveth us ſome drops of grace, and only giveth us a taſte of that happineſs that we wait for, that we may hie our ſelves ſo much the faſter through <pb n="532" facs="tcp:47453:274"/>this wilderneſs, to enjoy it. This therefore is a ſtrong reaſon wherefore the people of God muſt needs ſay, <hi>Come, Even ſo, Amen;</hi> let it be ſo, becauſe (I ſay) they know till Chriſt come the ſecond time, they muſt not expect the accompliſhment of their hope, and the perfection of their happineſs.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt Reaſon of this Point may be this, becauſe we are taught by our Lord and Saviour Chriſt to pray, <hi>Thy kingdome come.</hi> That is, not only that the kingdome of grace may come into our hearts while we are here, but that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory may haſten upon us: and we are ſure that this Petition ſhall never be granted to us, till Chriſt his return again to judgment, till he come to accompliſh this main promiſe of all: for then only Chriſt cometh as our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Then he cometh as a Lord, and makes an end of all the warrs of the Church, then he ſhall throw down all enemies before him, treading Sathan, and all his inſtruments under his feet, then he ſhall manifeſt to the world that he hath <hi>the Keyes of hell, and of death,</hi> then he ſhall deſtroy the kingdome of Antichriſt, that muſt be aboliſhed by the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his coming. And then, and not till then, he ſhall come as a Saviour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form perfect ſalvation for his Church, to deliver his Church, not only from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but from the moleſtation of ſin, not only from tyranny and oppreſſion of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but even from all the preſence of enemies, that at that day a ſeparation being made, it may be ſaid to the Saints of god, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to the Iſraelities when they were afraid of the Egyptians, ſtand ſtill, <hi>fear nothing the enemies that your eyes have ſeen to day, ye ſhall never ſee them more,</hi> they ſhall be ſo far from oppreſſing the Church, that they ſhall never moleſt the Church not ſo much as by their preſence, then he ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the kingdome to his members, as the Father hath diſpoſed the kingdome to him.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſtrong and effectual reaſons to prove this point to us, that the members of the Church, true beleevers cannot poſſibly but wait and expect, and vehemently deſire the coming of Chriſt the ſecond time, for the ſalvation of his Body, the final ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his people.</p>
               <p>Here one objection may be made by the way, and ſo we will deſcend to the Uſe and Application of it.</p>
               <p>Here it may be ſaid; But why do the people of God thus expect and wait for the coming of Chriſt, in all the Ages of the New Teſtament for the ſpace of 1600 years, and yet he cometh not? What reaſon have they to be commanded to expect and wiſh, and wait for the coming of Chriſt, when he cometh not in ſo long a time? Have not all been fruſtrate of their expectation? And may not we as well as they that lived in the Ages before us, for we ſee no appearance of his coming, no more then was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years ſince?</p>
               <p>To this we anſwer; That the patient abiding, and waiting of the juſt never miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrieth: the Saints of God never loſt nor ſhall loſe for their expecting, and waiting for Chriſts ſecond coming to Judgment. The Saints of God in former ages 1600. years ago waited for Chriſts coming; but were they loſers by it though he came not? This expectation of his coming, it kept them in the exerciſe of their faith, of their hope, of their patience, of their watchfulneſs, it kept all their graces a working, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were no loſers by it, though they had not the accompliſhment of the main promiſe: in expecting the promiſe, they were ſavers and no loſers, becauſe all their graces were kept in exerciſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, in the ſecond place, the very expectation of Chriſt in the Ages of the New-Teſtament, though he came not, it is fruitful and uſeful to draw up the hearts and minds of the godly to heavenly thoughts, and to a heavenly converſation: and ſo in the very firſt Ages of the New-Teſtament, the Apoſtle tells us that this is the uſe of their expectation: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven, from whence we look for a Saviour:</hi> they looked for a Saviour then, when he was but newly aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: was it fruitleſs becauſe he came not of 1600. years after? No, but <hi>Our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is therefore in heaven, becauſe we wait for his coming.</hi> In all ages ſince, this expectation hath been a means to raiſe the heavy mold of earth, the heart of man to heaven and heavenly-mindedneſs: therefore this expectation doth not fail, becauſe it is of uſe to help them to the full fruition of it in the time of it.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Saints of God never murmure, becauſe Chriſt cometh not, they never <pb n="533" facs="tcp:47453:274"/>murmure as thoſe that ſhall loſe their hopes and expectation, becauſe they are taught to frame their minds and wills, to the will of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt their head: Now, the will of God is that we ſhould ſtill wait, though Chriſt come not, becauſe hereby the Lord doth glorifie himſelf in the gathering in together, the number of the faithful. The number of the Saints muſt be gathered in, and none muſt be neglected: Now, is there any Saint of God, and beleever in the world that deſireth not that every Saint ſhould be gathered in, and the whole body of Chriſt perfected in the whole members of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt come to judgment? None muſt be neglected, &amp; every beleever muſt frame his will to the will of God; God hath revealed that the number muſt be gathered in, and when it is ſo, Chriſt will come and gather all together under his wing. Now the Saints of God think not much that the number ſhould be gathered in, they are well contented with it. So likewiſe God hath revealed his will, that though he be exceeding patient to wicked men, yet he is not forgetful of his promiſe; God will be contented though he be provoked every day infinitely by the higheſt ſins of the world, patiently to endure all this, and to offer conditions of peace and mercy, even to the worſt, to ſhew himſelf rich in mercy, and ſo full of goodneſs, that he makes offer even of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the worſt. Now the Saints of God here frame their will to Gods, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſtill to wait, becauſe God ſtill putteth forth his patience, and ſtill offereth Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of mercy and peace to thoſe that are wicked, and out of the way, whereby ſome are converted, and others convinced, and prepared for the work of Gods juſtice. So this queſtion need not trouble men, or hold them off from a chearful, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expectation of Chriſt, though he come not in our age, as he hath not in others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>The uſe of the Point is this, Firſt, if this be the property of the godly to wait and earneſtly to expect the coming of Chriſt, then we may obſerve the general ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the World, by the general want of this expectation.</p>
               <p>And if ye ſay; but who is there that doth not expect the ſecond coming of Chriſt? and who doth not beleeve that he ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, notwithſtanding that every man confeſſe this Article of faith with his mouth, yet every man beleeveth it not with his heart; for every man frameth not himſelf according to the faith of it. Very few are thoſe faithful ſervants that wait and prepare for their Maſters coming; Chriſt when he cometh he ſhall ſcarce find faith on the earth. What a number of Men and Women are there, though they hear theſe things, and they are beaten upon them upon many occaſions, and they are in their judgments convinced that it muſt be ſo; yet notwithſtanding the faith of their hearts apprehend it not, they do not beleeve it, they do not liſten and frame to it. We (like <hi>Caleb</hi>) tell them of the good Land, and the fat of the Land, and the fruit of the Land, and the fulneſs of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but generally men (like the unthankful <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) murmure, and repine, and rebel, and ſcarce hear us; or if they do, they do not beleeve it: For if men did beleeve it, it could not be that men ſhould live like <hi>Saduces</hi> as they do, that neither beleeve the ſoul, nor immortality, neither that there are ſpirits, nor Devils, nor reſurrection, nor nothing: the lives and converſations of men plainly bewray that they beleeve not this Doctrine, though they can profeſs with the mouth, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come again to judge the quick and the dead, but like the Cardinal of whom we read; that profeſt he would not give his part in <hi>Paris,</hi> for his part in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> ſo men live as if they would not give their part here on earth, for a Childs part in Heaven. Like that wicked Pope that we read of when he was about to die, now (ſaith he) <hi>I ſhall know that which I never beleeved, whether there be a Heaven or Hell, an immoatality of the ſoul or no.</hi> So men live as if they never meant to know thoſe things or beleeve them, till they come to the tryal and experience of them.</p>
               <p>And beſides, what a number of men and women are there that can profeſs theſe things with their mouth, but they caſt themſelves into a faſt ſleep in ſin and ſecurity, and ſleep on both ſides, Gods Meſſengers and Miniſters cannot awake them, but as though their ſouls were to ſleep everlaſtingly; ſo they ſleep on in their luſts and ſins, and will not be awakened.</p>
               <p>And (my brethren) who doth not obſerve that it is not the faſhion of men even <pb n="534" facs="tcp:47453:275"/>of thoſe that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, to ſay, <hi>come Lord Jeſus,</hi> till they be on their death-beds, and till they be ſcarce able to ſpeak or breath out a word; they never ſay come Lord Jeſus, till they know not what to do with themſelves, till they can enjoy their luſts, and the World, and their ſins no longer; they cannot tell how to bequeath themſelves longer to the ſervice of ſin and unrighteouſneſs, till then they never call after the Lord Jeſus to come to them: and when they do, it is not out of love and affection to Chriſt, but out of ſelf-love to help them out of the hands of death, that is too ſtrong for them; and to fetch them out of that miſery, they are too weak to ſuſtain. Therefore they call Lord Jeſus, but (as I ſaid) it is far from the love of him in their hearts; for were theſe men to live over their lives again, and to be reſtored to health again, it would be the laſt breath of their lives ſtill to call the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>My brethren, where theſe things are (and we find them too general, every man that looks into his own heart, may find himſelf in ſome meaſure touched therein) certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it cannot be that this ſame lively deſire of a Chriſtian can be there, and theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can have little comfort in themſelves, they have few arguments to prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Elect of God, having the Spirit of God, or to be thoſe that hear the promiſes with faith, or thoſe that thirſt after Chriſt; there is no argument in them that they are Chriſts, becauſe they long not and deſire after him.</p>
               <p>But therefore in the ſecond place, ſince this deſire is ſo rare; let us try our ſelves a little, even thoſe that profeſs better things, and hope well that they are indeed the Spouſe of Chriſt. Let us try and ſearch our ſelves whether this expectation be with us or no, that we may find comfort in our eſtate, and in our union and conjunction with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For tryal of this Point, firſt we muſt know that a neceſſary attendant and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this expectation of Chriſt, and waiting for him; is ſighing, and longing, and a vehement deſire after him. It is no ſlight, no ſuperficial deſire, but an inward vehement deſire, a ſighing and panting after Chriſt, as thoſe that ſee the need of him. And therefore as the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>hope deferred, paines the heart:</hi> the godly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the ſoul, bring pains to the ſoul for want of Chriſt in the abſence of Chriſt. And as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it in <hi>Rom.</hi>

                     </gap>rov. 13.12.</note> the 8. <hi>We ſigh in our ſelves</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the redemption of our bodies.</hi> We ſigh in our ſelves, as men that are ſick, or in pain, or oppreſt with a heavy burthen, ſigh out their ſorrowes and griefs; ſo the godly ſoul muſt labour to find this expectation, in the ſighing, longing, earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring after Chriſt; we ſigh in our ſelves, ſaith the Apoſtle; this is an argument of true love to Chriſt indeed, when we earneſtly deſire him in his abſence. As a true faithful Spouſe enjoyeth not her ſelf when ſhe enjoyeth not her Husband; ſo it is with the Spouſe of Chriſt, therefore the Apoſtle in the 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.5. joyneth them together, <hi>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God and into the patient way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for of Chriſt.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, there can be no love of Chriſt, if there be no waiting for Chriſt, and according to the vehemency of your love, will be the vehemency of your ſighing and longing after him. That's the firſt attendant of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation whereby we may examine our ſelves.</p>
               <p>A ſecond attendant is, a comfortable ſweet joy in the ſoul, a fruit of the ſpirit, not a fruit of preſumption, or of the fleſh, but a fruit of the ſpirit, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we rejoyce under the hope of the glory of God:</hi> where there is an earneſt and certain expectation of Chriſt (faith giving aſſurance to the ſoul of Chriſts return for the happineſs of it) it rejoyceth under the hope, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> reſolveth it ſelf into joy, becauſe it ſhall enjoy Chriſt. That which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, confirmeth this notably, <hi>whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having not ſeen, and yet we love him, and rejoyce with joy unſpeakeable and glorious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do we find this joy in our hearts?
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 18.</note> this heavenly joy? that which ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the preſence and full fruition of Chriſt? But alas! where ſhall we find this joy in the World? Men joy in Corn, and Wine, and oyle, in the encreaſing of their Money, and Stocks, and Eſtates; where is the joy the heart is reſolved into, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and remember the return of Chriſt to the full and perfect happineſs of the ſoul? Certainly (my brethren) this is a rare grace upon the earth; and yet where it is <pb n="535" facs="tcp:47453:275"/>not, that man can have no ſound argument in his own heart, that he hath this expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the coming of Chriſt, for with it there is a ſound joy in the heart that the world breeds not, nor cannot take away.</p>
               <p>A third companion to try the truth of this expectation is, an endeavour after puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart and life, this muſt needs go with this expectation; 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Hethat hath this hope purgeth himſelf, and is pure as he is pure:</hi> He that hath this hope that expects Chriſt hopefully and joyfully, he purgeth himſelf: he that waiteth for Chriſt, waiteth for him that he may be like him, that he may be holy as Chriſt is holy, (ſtill reſerving the proportion of a member) and be pure as Chriſt is pure.</p>
               <p>What a number be there, that profeſs they look for Chriſts return for their final ſalvation, and yet this expectation doth not purge their hearts, doth not cleanſe thoſe naſty and filthy corners that are there. It purgeth not their mouth from falſhood, and lying, and deceitful and curſed ſpeeches, nor their hands from injuſtice, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and the like; they are no whit like Chriſt in their converſation, and yet they hope for and expect Chriſt, no, he that hath this hope purgeth himſelf.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we think of them that oppoſe, that ſeek to oppreſs purity of heart and life? that caſt ſcorns upon purity and holineſs? what ſhall we think of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Shall we think that they have this expectation? They will tell ye I, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it before any man, and boldly ſtand, upon the expectation of their Saviour as well as others; but if thou hate purity in others, then thon hateſt it in thy ſelf, and he that purgeth not himſelf hath not this hope, for he that hath this hope, purgeth himſelf as he is pure.</p>
               <p>A fourth companion and attendant of this expectation, is Chriſtian fortitude and valour, and unweariedneſs in labouring and ſuffering for Chriſt. Where this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation is, the ſoul is invinſible in labouring and ſufferings; He careth not what he endures, what he ſets on for the name of Chriſt. This we ſhall ſee in the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had the white in his eye, when he had this aym ſet before him, <hi>the high price of the high calling of GOD in Chriſt, I forget the things (ſaith he) that are behind, and preſs hard to the things that are before.</hi> Though his labour and pains, and ſufferings were marvellous great, he forgetteth all them, and ſtill preſſed hard to the mark, the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus. So holy <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe <hi>he looked for the recompence of the reward, he choſe to ſuffer affliction with the people of GOD, rather then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</hi> Beſides, thoſe faithful ſervants of GOD, many other inſtances might be added, to ſhew that when a man hath this expectation that Chriſt will come, and give him the end and recompence of his labour, and eternal joy and glory for his ſhort ſufferings, which are not worthy of the glory that ſhall be revealed, he refuſeth no pains, no labour, no paſſion, no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Chriſt and a good conſcience. But what need we go further then the example of Chriſt himſelf, the example of all examples, <hi>who for the joy that was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, indured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame?</hi> and why was this? but for our example, that we ſhould deſpiſe the croſſes that are before us, and go on unweariedly, and unfaintingly through all croſſes and perſecutions; if we meet with never ſo many oppoſitions, with never ſo many Devils, yet to go chearfully on in the wayes of God, why? becauſe we have a hope, and an expectation before us of Chriſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Further, another attendant of this expectation is this; It bluntteh and abateth the ſiery edge of our affections to the things of this world. He that hath this expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is weaned from the world, it looſeneth the ſoul from the world every day more then other; Whereas naturally we are rivitted to earthly things, faſtened to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> world; this expectation wrought in the heart; cauſeth us to walk more looſely and unjoynted, it blunteth and abateth thoſe eager deſires that are in us to earthly things. See it in the example of that worthy ſervant of God <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a City, &amp; for the recompence of reward that was ſet before him; he ſcorned the treaſures of Egypt, he deſpiſed them, he cared not for honour or treaſures, or all that Egypt could afford, he had rather ſuffer afflictions with Gods people, why? becauſe he looked for therecompence of reward.</p>
               <p>Be there not a number of perſons that profeſs they expect Chriſt his return for <pb n="536" facs="tcp:47453:276"/>their final ſalvation, and yet notwithſtanding they are ſo fixed to the world; they gather the world as greedily, grapling the things of this life together ſo earneſtly, with ſuch vehement affections, as if they were to live their age over a hundred times? be there not a number of polititians that profeſs this hope too, that hold it moſt unwiſe and fooliſh thing in the world to loſe any thing for conſcience-ſake, and for Chriſt? Alas! theſe things will not ſtand with this expectation. When a man hath a good title to heaven he is content to part with the broken title to the things of this life: as long indeed as a man hath not a better title, he will hold to that worſe: but when he hath a bleſſed title to the inheritance of the Saints in light, he careth not for this bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Tenour and title, he will not hold them, becauſe they cannot hold him.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, another note that attendeth this expectation is, where this is, there will be an anſwerable affection, there will be a promoting of all the means to further it, their will be a grief and ſorrow for all things that come againſt it to hinder it. Thus we do in other expectations. When we expect this or that reverſion, when anything cometh between our hope, we grieve for it, any thing that cometh, or falleth out to further our hope, we rejoyce in it. And thus it will be likewiſe in this expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, if it be true, whatſoever it is that may further our hope, and further Chriſt his coming, that we deſire and pray for, that we rejoyce in, that we promote and put on with all our power and ſtrength; and becauſe a powerful miniſtry of the Word, promoteth the kingdome of Chriſt, and ſetcheth in the company that ſhall be ſaved, and haſteneth his coming; therefore we will withall our power and ſtrength, hold up the miniſtry of the Word of GOD, (that Scepter of Jeſus Chriſt) for the gathering in of people to God, for the perfecting of the number of the Elect, that ſo Chriſt may come and finiſh our ſalvations. And whatſoever it is that may haſten this his coming and appearing, we are glad to ſee it in the means of it, when the Word is preached, when the Sacraments are adminiſtred, when people are gathered to God, when grace appeareth in the hearts and lives of men, when we ſee the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs manifeſt it ſelf any where, when we ſee godly men incouraged and entertained, when we ſee the fear of God to prevail in Families and the like, we rejoyce at this. Why ſo? becauſe this increaſeth and confirmeth our hope, it gathereth in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that muſt be accompliſhed, before our final deliverance. And contrarily, when we ſee things to impair, and hinder the coming of the kingdome of Chriſt, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the ſalvations of men, when we ſee the Church of God left without able teachers, and in ſtead of them, to come in unprofitable and unſufficient ignorant men, when we ſee the free paſſage of the Goſpel hindered, many excellent lights ſhut under a buſhel, and their light hid from the people of God, and the Goſpel from the Church of God, when we ſee faction prevail, and both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical government deſpiſed, when Hereſies are countenanced, and the people of God diſcouraged and diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when we ſee the ſtate of the Church of God abroad, that many ſad blows are given by the enemies, and the ſword of the enemie is ſharp upon the Church, when we ſee theſe things, theſe dazle our hopes, they come between us and the kingdome, and ſecond coming of Chriſt, the haſtening of it: therefore there muſt be griefe for it.</p>
               <p>Thus it will be; We pray for every thing that may haſten it, and pray againſt every thing that ſtands between, and hinders the converſion of men, and the glory of God, and the proceedings of Chriſts kingdome: thus (I ſay) it will be with us.</p>
               <p>But where is the man that takes theſe things to heart? who ſetteth himſelf on theſe holy and conſcionable courſes? If this be ſo, it appeareth manifeſtly, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, though it be every where expreſt, is hard to be found any where; there be very few that believe our report, few there be that ſet themſelves to ſift and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſoundneſs of their expectation, and deſire after Chriſt, yet where it is not (theſe attendants) it is not ſound and ſincere.</p>
               <p>In a word, to ſtir us up to this, as the Church and the Spirit, and the Bride, and he that is athirſt here, ſaith <hi>Come,</hi> to ſtir up (I ſay) our deſires to this, we will uſe a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or two.</p>
               <p>Do we not ſee by all this diſcourſe a plain difference between godly men and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers? A godly man that hath the Spirit of God in him, ſaith <hi>come.</hi> A wicked <pb n="537" facs="tcp:47453:276"/>man hath no ſuch ſpirit in him; with his tongue he may ſay <hi>come</hi> ſometime, when he is forced, but he hath not the ſpirit to ſay <hi>come.</hi> Here is the difference in their preſent eſtate, but afterward the differences is greater; when the evil ſervant will not waite for his Maſters coming, but ſits with the drunken, and Libertines, he ſhall be made a ſpectacle of his maſters fury; <hi>The Lord of that ſervant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and will appoint him his portion with unbeleevers.</hi> Ther's then another difference.</p>
               <p>Again, conſider though the coming of our Lord Chriſt be certain, yet the particular time to our knowledge is uncertain; but though the particular time be uncertain, yet it is haſtening, it is not far off. In the time of the Apoſtle, there was but an hour, ſaith Saint <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 12.45, 46</note> 
                  <hi>now is the laſt hour:</hi> if it were the laſt hour in the Apoſtles time; certainly it is the laſt minute now, the very laſt minute of an hour now.</p>
               <p>And I beſeech you, let us conſider the promiſe that is made to perſons that expect the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervaut, whom his Maſter when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing:</hi> how doing? watching, and preparing for, and expecting of his Maſters coming; <hi>Bleſſed is the ſervant that his Maſter ſhall find ſo doing:</hi> he ſpeaks there in the ſingular number, there are not many that he ſhall find ſo doing; therefore he ſpeaks of one that is bleſſed, one of many that ſhall be found ſo doing. <hi>Bleſſed are they that watch and keep their garments clean,</hi> that purge themſelves as he is pure, that labour to be holy as he is holy; bleſſed is he that doth ſo.</p>
               <p>If it were not for theſe promiſes, how were it able for Chriſtians to get over the rubbs and hinderances that lie in the way of this expectation? how were it poſſible for a Chriſtian to leap over the brunt of reproaches, the execution of ſentences, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions that the Saints of God go under? onely becauſe they have an eye upon the White, the expectation of the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The faithful Martyrs in this Kingdome, and in other Countries; what did drive them to embrace the flames, and the crueleſt death and torments that Perſecutors could deviſe? but onely this was in their eye, this bore them out againſt all the threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings, and ſufferings of the World, this was that that did give them encouragement and comfort above all diſcouragements.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, above all let us encourage our ſelves, by the fruit and recompence of all this expectation; what is that? the Apoſtle Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that when this hope ſhall come into our hand, when our faith ſhall meet with fruition, then we ſhall ſee Chriſt ſo as to be like him: here is ſuch a ſight of Chriſt, as never the eye of fleſh ſaw, nor can ſee; to ſee Chriſt and to be like him, to ſee him as he is; here is ſuch a ſight as would raviſh us if we knew what it was, and we cannot know while we are on earth; eye hath not ſeen that which we ſhall ſee in Chriſt: but when we ſhall enjoy this expectation, we ſhall ſee him as he is, and ſee him ſo as to be like him. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>John</hi> 17.24.) <hi>I will that where I am they may be, that they may ſee my glory.</hi> Wicked men ſee his glory, what priviledge then between them and the godly? It is true indeed wicked men ſee the glory of Chriſts perſon, and they ſhall ſee and feel the glory of his juſtice; but the godly ſee the glory not onely of his perſon, not onely of his juſtice, but the glory that no wicked man ever ſhall ſee, the glory of his Mercy, and goodneſs, and grace; here is the difference. God getteth himſelf glory upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in drowning of him; but God getteth himſelf the glory of his Mercy in Iſrael, in ſaving them in the bottome of the Sea: ſo the godly, they ſee the glory not onely of the perſon of Chriſt (and that is infinite and ſurpaſſeth apprehenſion) but they ſee the glory of his Mercy, of his eternal goodneſs, and they ſee it ſo as to be like him, to be tranſlated into that glory, to get a part and ſhare of it (as much as they are capable of) they make themſelves all glorious with his glory, and ſhine with his brightneſs and beauty.</p>
               <p>Alas brethren, all the ſight we can get of Chriſt in this world, it is like the ſight of the blind man that Chriſt cured, he bad him look up, and lift up his eyes, and he ſaw men walking as trees, an imperfect ſight; ſo we have here but an imperfect glimpſe of Chriſt, we ſee him through a glaſs, through the Word and Sacraments, and theſe means that he hath appointed, an imperfect ſight, till Chriſt give us a clear ſight, and makes us ſee perfectly, and this is in the day of his return. All the ſight and <pb n="538" facs="tcp:47453:277"/>viſion of Chriſt in this life, it is but to ſee him in a glaſs (faith the Apoſtle) as in a looking glaſs, but then we ſhall ſee him face to face, we ſhall ſee him as he is. What difference there is between the ſhadow in a glaſs, and the face it ſelf, ſo much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there is between the ſight of Chriſt here, and hereafter, when we ſhall ſee him as he is, when we ſhall ſee him with open face, and not in a mirrour. Therefore let this incourage us, and ſtir up our hearts, to expect and wait for the coming of Chriſt with vehement and daily prayers, with fervency of ſpirit, with the Church, and the Bride, and the Spirit to ſay, <hi>Even ſo, Amen,</hi>

               <p>I cannot with comfort and conſcience proceed, to the collecting of obſervations out of a Text, whilſt conſcious to my ſelf, that the ſame is incumbred with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and we meet with two main ones in the Text which muſt firſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved.</p>
               <div n="1" type="question">
                  <head>Firſt Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>This being, (as I may ſay) the <hi>firſt day of Judgment,</hi> when God in the text legally proceeded to the ſentencing of <hi>Adam</hi> (caſt by the confeſſion of his own conſcience) how cometh it to paſs that only <hi>Temporal puniſhment</hi> is inflicted upon him. One might juſtly have expected, that God rather would have ſaid, <hi>from Hell came thy ſin, and to Hell let thy ſin return, and thy ſoul go a long with is.</hi> Or <hi>you ſhall go from the place wherein you ſtand, to the place of eternal Damnation,</hi> where the <hi>worm dyeth not, and the fire is not quenched, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Whereas now the mention only of Temporal death, hath given the hint to <hi>Prophane</hi> perſons in this licentious age (greedy to ſnatch at all ſhaddows of advantage) no leſs boldly then falſly to maintain, that ſin in its own nature, doth only diſerve, and ſhall only receive <hi>Temporal Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, firſt <hi>Negatively,</hi> It was not becauſe ſin in its own nature, deſerveth only Temporal Death ſeeing, (were it the work of the day, and the time as proper as the place for that purpoſe) Legions of Scriptures, might be produed to prove that <hi>et ernal</hi> (as well as <hi>temporal</hi>) death is due to the <hi>demerit</hi> of ſin, yet none can wonder at prophane perſons, if willing to kindle comfort to themſelves at every Gloworm they meet with, it being for the intreſt of thieves and murderers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (if they can ſo perſwade themſelves) that there never will be <hi>Goales, Judge, Sizes, Seſſions, Sheriffs,</hi> or <hi>Executioners.</hi> But for moſt weighty reaſons, <hi>Obvius</hi> and open to our apprehenſion, (beſides others no doubt concealed in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome) Divine wiſdome adjudged it not convenient to beſentence our firſt Parents with eternal Damnation, though according to his juſtice and their deſerts, it might have been inflicted upon them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt ingeneral I anſwer, <hi>Why ſhould any mans eye be evil becauſe Gods is good?</hi> What if he were pleaſed to abate of legal extremity, and mercifully to remit much thereof who ſhall ſay unto him, <hi>why doſt thou ſo?</hi> Indeed <hi>Itinerant Judges</hi> bound to obſerve the letter of the Law, may not, but a King by his Prerogative may <pb n="541" facs="tcp:47453:278"/>commute the <hi>Gallows</hi> into the <hi>Brand,</hi> qualify the <hi>Brand</hi> into the <hi>Whip,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſh offences without wrong to any, becauſe therein he doth only, <hi>uti imperio ſuo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deſcend we now to more particular anſwers, and before we go further; the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will grant this unto me (which if denyed me I ſhall be bold to take, as <hi>an undoubted truth</hi>) that had the ſentence of eternal condemnation, been once pronounced by God, and paſſed on <hi>Adam;</hi> It, like the Laws of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians, Dan.</hi> 6.8. could not ever after be reverſed, or repealed. This being premiſed I tender to your conſideration, how inconſiſtent it was with Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to curſe <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to the Pitt of Hell, beheld either in their <hi>Perſonal Notion,</hi> as ſingle ſouls, or in their <hi>collective capacity,</hi> as the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of all man-kind.</p>
                  <p>For the former, God would not curſe <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve,</hi> as private perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe foreſeeing, that both of them would repent, and lay hold on the <hi>Promiſed ſeed,</hi> and ſo eternally be ſaved; indeed there were in the primitive time a ſort of Heretiques, no leſs <hi>uncharitable</hi> then <hi>Erronious,</hi> who maintained that both <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were damned, (baſe birds thus to defile their own neſt) whoſe Doctrine was exploded by conſcientious Chriſtians, and the contrary avowed and aſſerted by the <hi>Church of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, conſider <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> as the repreſentatives of all man-kind, and ſo all the ELECTS lay hid in the Loyns of the one, and Womb of the other; <hi>I have bleſſed him</hi> (ſaid <hi>Iſaac</hi> of <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 27.33.) <hi>yea and he ſhall be bleſſed;</hi> by the ſame proportion it followed more firmly, that if God had curſed the elect in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> they ſhould have been curſed, which was diametrically oppoſite to Gods gracious intent, yea, would have proyed deſtructive to his deſign, having fore-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed from all eternity, in due time to ſay unto them, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you, from the Foundation of the World.</hi> Yea which is moſt material, Chriſt himſelf, of whom it was ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed,</hi> according to his humanity, <hi>and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in his cauſes,</hi> had even then a <hi>Seminal exiſtence</hi> in our firſt Parents. What ſaid <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 23.8. <hi>How ſhall I curſe whom God hath not curſed, or how ſhall I defie, whom the Lord hath not defyed?</hi> But it followeth, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> that <hi>God could not,</hi> that is <hi>would not,</hi> iſſue out an eternal malediction on them, who had him in them, who was the <hi>fountain of all bleſſedneſs,</hi> and that by Gods own <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment,</hi> an <hi>Act</hi> as much precedanious to my Text, and which by due ſeniori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty took place of <hi>Adams</hi> puniſhment, as <hi>eternity</hi> is before <hi>time,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 19. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In further illuſtration of this our anſwer, it is very obſervable, that God in this Chapter, twice diſcharged the terrible word <hi>Curſed,</hi> and yet both times <hi>deſignedly</hi> no doubt, (he can beſt, if ſo pleaſed <hi>miſs the mark,</hi> who if ſo pleaſed, can <hi>beſt hit it</hi>) miſſeth both <hi>Adam and Eve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once verſe 14. <hi>Thou art curſed above all Cattel,</hi> and this Curſed he beſtowed on the Serpent.</p>
                  <p>The other on the earth, verſe 17. <hi>Curſed be the ground for thy ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Sons of Princes committed faults, it was uſual for the ſervants of thoſe ſons to be beaten. As here the earth, is puniſhed for the fault of man his Maſter, and the curſe is on it inflicted which by him was deſerved.</p>

                     <hi>Adam</hi> became <hi>mortal</hi> from that very inſtant, that he eat the forbidden fruit. Sickneſs then areſted him, though he was not impriſoned in the grave till many years after, before his full <hi>natural heat</hi> and <hi>radical moiſture,</hi> knew and kept their reſpective bounds in his body, without the leaſt mutual encroachment, ſince his fall they are turned fierce foes, lying at the catch and waiting advantages to invade one another: ſince the very minute of his preverication, his body ſickneſs-proof before, was ſubject to be drowned with the dropſie, burnt by the ſeaver, ſwelled by the Gout, ſhrivelled by the Conſumption; in a word, he carried in his <hi>Soul</hi> the ſeeds of all ſins, in his <hi>body</hi> of all diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>In common diſcourſe we date a Malefactor dead (though not <hi>naturally legally</hi>) form the ſentence of condemnation paſſed upon him; It is but a <hi>dead life</hi> which he leads after that time, ſuch being the <hi>Chancery,</hi> as I may ſay of <hi>Common Law,</hi> to allow him a few dayes to diſpoſe himſelf for death; in the ſame ſence we behold <hi>Adam,</hi> as <hi>no man of this World,</hi> as <hi>Dead</hi> and <hi>defunct,</hi> (though reſpited and reprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for ſome years) from the time that he eat the forbidden fruit.</p>
                  <p>We muſt not forget that Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> in whoſe mouthing languages (departing confuſedly from <hi>Babel</hi>) met methodically then in any other Father, highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the tranſlation of <hi>Simacus,</hi> reading theſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Morieris,</hi> thou ſhalt die; <hi>Mortalis eris,</hi> thou ſhalt be mortal; herein if he rendred not the letter like an exact Tranſlator thereof, he hath given in the true ſence of the word, as <hi>a judicious commentator</hi> thereon.</p>

                     <hi>All man-kind derive their original from duſt.

                  <p>Firſt Uſe, to retrench our Pride, at the ſerious conſideration of our mean ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; <hi>Virgil</hi> tells us, Georgicks the fourth, that when Bees fiercely fight in the Air, the ſpeedieſt way to part them, is by caſting duſt upon them.<lb/>
                     <q>
                        <l>Hi motus animorum, atque hac certamina tanta,</l>

                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when Swarms of luſts in our proud Souls fight one againſt another; and all againſt the word and will of God, the quickeſt means to compoſe them, is by throwing ſome duſt, pouring meditations of mortality upon them.</p>
                  <p>Second Uſe, to confute the curioſity of ſuch, who expend ſo much precious time, care and coſt, in pargoting, painting, pouldering, patching, and perfume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their bodies, which <hi>came from, and go to the duſt.</hi> Here firſt, I allow a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary neatneſs due to our bodies, leaſt otherwiſe we antedate our own ſtench, leaſt otherwiſe <hi>before our time,</hi> this our <hi>duſt</hi> turn <hi>dirt,</hi> and become offenſive to our ſelves and others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I allow (for God allows) an ornamental decency, proportionable to the condition and eſtates of perſons, and I find, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.22. Eare-rings in the ears, and bracelets in the hand of <hi>Rebeckah,</hi> though to any judicious eye, thoſe hands ſeemed more beautiful for the <hi>Buckets</hi> ſhe did bear, then for the <hi>Bracelets</hi> ſhe did wear. But blame-worthy their pride, and vanity, who ſpend about their bodies time and coſt, to the neglect of their Souls.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of Queen Katherine Dowager,
<note place="margin">Sand. <hi>de ſciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Anglicano.</hi>
                     </note> firſt Wife to King Henry the eighth, that ſhe accounted no time worſe ſpent then what was waſted in dreſſing of her; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſeeing nature, was not over bountiful of beauty unto her, and having a humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Husband to content, art might the more excuſably be indulged unto her; but how many are there who eſteem no time well laid out, but what is ſpent in tricking, trimming, decking and adorning themſelves. The Commoedian could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>dum moliuntur, dum comuntur unus eſt;</hi> but the Divine may complain, <hi>dum precantur, vix ſemihorula eſt.</hi> To tell that Sex of their faults in that language they beſt underſtand, too much time is loſt by them in their dreſſing, to little in their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Here let me humbly tender a motion to the Gallants of our time, and may it but meet reception, and entertainment ſutable to the ſeaſonableneſs thereof, when they do curiouſly powder their Hair, (how welcome is the meal of old age of mans, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome of Gods beſprinkling) let them even then call to mind, this is but anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating the work and words formerly uſed at mens burials, Duſt to duſt, for duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return.</p>
                  <p>Third Uſe of comfort. Of comfort (may ſome ſay) that is impoſſible to ariſe natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from this Text, <hi>can meat come from the devourers, can any good come out of a Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee?</hi> Behold the Text is hung about on all ſides with mourning, and therefore little chearfulneſs, and leſs comfort, can thence rationally be expected, however moſt cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and diſtilled conſolation may be extracted from the Text, and it is pitty to expreſs it in any other than in <hi>Davids</hi> words, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.14. <hi>For he knoweth our frame, he remembreth that we are but duſt,</hi> and therefore of his gratious goodneſs will not expect, <hi>Golden performances,</hi> from <hi>duſty Performers.</hi> He will be pleaſed to accept, <hi>duſty Prayers,</hi> and <hi>duſty Preaching, duſty Reading,</hi> and <hi>duſty Alms-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> from us, as proportionable to our extraction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="544" facs="tcp:47453:280"/>God knoweth that the Angels <hi>are not Duſt,</hi> and therefore he may juſtly expect from them, and require of them, to ſerve him, in <hi>altitudinibus,</hi> in <hi>height of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,</hi> having a fourfold advantage above men, by their very origination.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Angels are incorporeal, who can act quicker then I can think? My ſluggiſh imagination cannot keep pace with their performances. It was but a Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick fiction, <hi>that the Spaniſh gennets were conceived of the Wind.</hi> But it is a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical truth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. <hi>He maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Miniſters a flaming fire.</hi> Whereas we poor men, do drale and drag a cumberſome corps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, which much hindereth us in all our devotions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Angels have no <hi>fleſh,</hi> and we have <hi>fleſh,</hi> this will ſome ſay <hi>interferreth</hi> with the former: Oh no. Our Saviour had a body, and that a real one, but no <hi>fleſh</hi> in this ſence, that is no relique and remnant of original corruption, whereas we have both <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>fleſh</hi> too, in the worſt acception of the latter; This <hi>Eſquire</hi> of <hi>our body</hi> (as I may call it) is over officious in his dayly attendance, ſo that whilſt the <hi>Wind</hi> of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> bloweth us one way, the <hi>tide</hi> of our corruption hurrieth us another way, a miſcheif from which Angels are ſecured by their nature.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Angels have no <hi>World</hi> to tempt them. We live <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the middle of <hi>Snares,</hi> ſo bad that we ſhould not look upon them, but ſo common that we can hardly look beſide them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly; Angels are free from any Devil, effectually to tempt them, ſhould Satan indeavour, he could not accompliſh it. The match cannot be lighted where there is no tinder to take fire; Whereas ſuch our corruption, it is quickly enflamed with Satans temptations.</p>
                  <p>Angels having thus a fourfold advantage above men, and ſeeing they, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. <hi>Excell in ſtrength,</hi> whilſt we poor mortals <hi>exceed in weakneſs,</hi> God will expect from us ſervice ſutable to the mean matter we are made of, and in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting with us, will give us <hi>grains of allowance,</hi> make favourable abatements, and accept of proportionable defalcations, <hi>remembring that we are but Duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me hear make a ſuppoſition, not only ſeaſable in it ſelf, but which <hi>de facto,</hi> we ſee dayly performed; ſuppoſe a man had two Sons, the one grown to the full ſtrength and ſtature of a man, the other (which uſually happeneth by the ſame venter) an infant which hath newly learned the method of going alone. Suppoſe further, that the Father at the ſame time, commandeth them both to come to him, and bring with them ſomewhat proportionable to their ſtrength, in obedience whereunto, the <hi>man-ſon,</hi> bringeth a Beam or Log on his ſhoulders.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Child-ſon</hi> cometh alſo, and what doth he bring with him? It is very well if he bringeth himſelf, for every ſtep he ſtirreth he ventureth a ſtumbling if not a falling, but what if alſo over and above himſelf; he bringeth a <hi>ſtraw</hi> or <hi>reed</hi> in his hand.</p>
                  <p>I appeal to you who are Parents of Children (others being but incompetent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the caſe in hand,) to you I ſay, who have paternal affection reſident in your breaſts, and maternal legure in your boſomes, whether you would not take it in as good part, a reed of your <hi>Child-ſon,</hi> (as a Beam of your <hi>Man-ſons</hi> bringing; I trough you would. Have earthly Fathers, who are but <hi>parcel-pittiful,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Court of Chancery</hi> in their hearts, and ſhall not God, <hi>whoſe mercy is over all his works,</hi> exceed us in all <hi>bowels of compaſſion?</hi> God I ſay, who may be ſaid to have two forts of Sons, <hi>Angels,</hi> already arrived at their full ſtrength and perfection.

                  <p>However none can without manifeſt uſurpation entitle themſelves to the leaſt ſhare in this Uſe of comfort, if the connection of <hi>Davids</hi> words (whereon they <pb n="145" facs="tcp:47453:280"/>are founded) be ſeriouſly conſidered, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13, 14. <hi>Like as a Father pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Children: ſo the Lord pittieth them that fear him. For be knoweth our frame; he remembreth that we are duſt.</hi> See here God only reflecteth with favours on the <hi>duſty extraction of thoſe</hi> that fear him, and no others.</p>
                  <p>Therefore let no prophane perſon, ſuck <hi>poyſon</hi> out of the <hi>ſweet flower</hi> of our <hi>comfortable uſe,</hi> and diſpoſe himſelf to leudneſs, or (at the beſt) <hi>lazineſs</hi> in Gods ſervice, preſuming that God, knowing his Original of Duſt, will therefore accept of his, as of but <hi>duſty</hi> performance. Here let me diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>duſty,</hi> and <hi>Dung-hil</hi> ſerving of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Duſty ſerving</hi> of him is, when men endeavours to the utmoſt ſtrength, of their weakneſs to ſerve him, when they preſent him (as <hi>Jacob</hi> did unknown <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 43.11.) <hi>with the beſt,</hi> (and thoſe God knowes but had) fruit of our Land in our veſſels, doing all in ſincerity (which is <hi>Goſpel perfection</hi>) and the mean time <hi>confeſſing of, groaning for,</hi> and <hi>fighting againſt</hi> thoſe many corruptions, and more imperfections which cleave unto their moſt perfect performances. This is <hi>Duſty ſerving</hi> of God, <hi>Dung-hil ſerving</hi> of him is, which proceedeth from perſons <hi>Dead in Treſpaſſes and ſins, Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. ſending forth the ſame ſavour in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrills of the God of Heaven, with <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he had been <hi>three dayes</hi> buried, <hi>John</hi> the 11.39. And although ſuch actions may appear ſpetious to the beholders, yea, and breath forth no bad ſent at all, to wicked men in the ſame condition (one rotten corps is not offenſive to an other) <hi>yet as dead flies cauſe, Eccleſ.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Ointment of Apothecary, to ſend forth an ill ſavour,</hi> ſo <hi>Hypochricy</hi> appendant to ſuch actions, rendereth them noiſom to that infinite being, who is Emuncliſſimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, moſt <hi>exact and critical in his ſmelling.</hi> This is <hi>Dung-hill ſerving of God,</hi> moſt odious unto him, and therefore the Godly do deteſt and abhor it, whilſt they only grieve and bemoan at their <hi>duſty ſervice of God,</hi> which notwithſtanding if, (qualified as formerly ſtated, is acceptable in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Come we now to the <hi>Mark,</hi> to which we all run, <hi>and unto duſt ſhalt thou return.</hi> Whence we obſerve this Doctrine, <hi>All humane art cannot preſerve a corps from final returning to duſt.</hi> I ſay, <hi>final,</hi> although for a time it may repreive the ſame from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>pulverized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Far be it from me, diſpitefully to decoy the ingenious indeavours, (and they be but endeavours) of any in <hi>Chyrurgery,</hi> I will not add any to my <hi>ignorance</hi> in that <hi>miſtery,</hi> yet I ſay. Art muſt <hi>cry craven,</hi> in this experiment, and cannot ſecure a corps, from mouldering into it firſt matter, <hi>Duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For proof hereof let us ſuppoſe, firſt that which I may call an <hi>healthful corps, viz.</hi> of one not weakned and waſted with a long lingering and languiſhing diſeaſe, but of one cut off ſuddenly in the prime of his youth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Suppoſe an Artiſt expert in his profeſſion of Embalming, no whit infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them, who made the <hi>laſt bed</hi> for the repoſe of King <hi>Aſa's</hi> corps, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.14. <hi>of ſweet oders by the art of the Apothecary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, allow him the moſt and beſt of ſpices, not only a <hi>mixture of Myrrhe and alloes, about an hundred pound weight</hi> (the proportion aſſigned by <hi>Nicodemus</hi> for our Saviours body, <hi>John</hi> 19.39.) but as many as <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Embalmer being ſtinted to no number but his own pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, becauſe moiſt Countries be accuſed to invite corruption, let us lay the ſcene of this experiment in <hi>Egypt</hi> it ſelf, where the dryneſs of the clymates may contribute ſomething to the affecting of the work.</p>
                  <p>The premiſes thus provided in matter and manner, in kind and degree, to the Chyrurgions full deſire, let him not begin his opperation, and fall on working, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of art. Here I ſuppoſe he will with his inſtruments firſt take out the <hi>brains</hi> and <hi>bowels,</hi> of both which <hi>conclamatum eſt,</hi> it is granted on all ſides that they cannot be preſerved from putrefaction, and juditious art will not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on a labour in vain.</p>
                  <p>Next I conceive he will curiouſly incorporate his ſpices, into thoſe, vacuities, and concavities, out of which the brains and bowels (thoſe hags of corruptions) were taken out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="546" facs="tcp:47453:281"/>Thirdly, after the uſing of much art in order to his deſign, he will build the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy many ſtories high in perfumed <hi>Sear-cloaths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, he will depoſite it in ſome dry place, perchance where no earth ſhall touch it, leſt as ill company often ſolicite good natures to badneſs, the corps may be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by contiguity to the earth, the ſooner <hi>to return to duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now when all this is done, all in effect is ſtill undone, as to the thing undertaken, I deny not but that a corps may thus be preſerved ſome <hi>hundreds,</hi> or perhaps for ſome <hi>thouſands</hi> of years. And yet give me leave to ſay of ſuch a body, <hi>minima eſt pars, ſui ipſius, there is the leaſt of fleſh and body, in that fleſh or body,</hi> the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof inſenſibly reſolving into duſt, and that duſt vaniſhing into nothing, that doth appear; ſo that the moſt of what remaineth is the ſubſtance of ſpice and fleſh, and that at laſt paſſeth to duſt as its general matter.</p>
                  <p>Yea ſuch prodigious coſt of Embalming beſtowed on bodies, hath accedentally occaſioned their ſpeedier corruption. Many a poor mans body hath ſlept quietly in his grave without any diſturbance, whilſt the corps of ſome <hi>Egyptian Princes</hi> might juſtly complain with [ſeeming] <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15. <hi>Why haſt thou diſquieted me, to bring me up,</hi> their <hi>Fingers,</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi> and <hi>Armes, Toes, Feet,</hi> and <hi>Legs,</hi> and <hi>Thighes,</hi> and all their body, tug'd and torne out of their tombs, tumbled and toſſed many hundred miles by Sea and Land, bought and brought by Drugiſts for Mummy, and buryed in the bellies of other men, they it ſeems being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals, who feed on mans fleſh for <hi>food,</hi> though not for Phiſick, all which may ſeem a juſt judgment of God, on the imoderate coſt and curioſity in their embalming, as if endeavouring thereby to defeat and fruſtrate Gods ſentence, and to conſure the truth in my Text. <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, as a loving child; which is violently kept from his tender Mother, will wait and watch his firſt and beſt opportunity to return to his Mother again. So e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans body is a child of the Mother Earth and though the vigilant eye, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful hand of art, endeavoureth its utmoſt to detain this child from the arms of its Mother; maugre all obſtruction, it will make its way unto her; <hi>for duſt thou art and unto duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt Uſe, this teacheth us what to think of <hi>Popiſh Reliques,</hi> their Prieſt pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of their Saints bodies to remain in their ſhrines at this day uncorrupted, thus they fabulouſly report, that the hand of Saints King <hi>Oſwald.</hi>
                     <lb/>
                     <q>Nullo verme perit, nulla putredine tabet
Dextra viri, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That no worm or putrifaction tainted his right hand, which had been ſo abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bountiful to the poor, If ſo, he had far better ſucceſs, then he who was a better Kind and Saint, even <hi>David</hi> himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36. <hi>Who after he had ſerved his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, was laid to his fathers, and ſaw corruption.</hi> But moſt of theſe Popiſh forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were diſcovered at the deſolution, and ſuch bodies found as rotten as their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition who adored them.</p>
                  <p>Second Uſe, <hi>Seeing it is impoſſible to preſerve our bodies from returning to duſt, let us labour to keep our ſouls from being turned to damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eccleſ. 12.7. <hi>Then ſhall the duſt return to the earth, as it was, and the Spirit ſhall return to God that gave it.</hi> Wherein obſerve all Spirits both good and bad, after death return to; as to the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> to do their homage unto him; I ſay, they all inſtantly return unto him: from him alone to recerve <hi>new orders:</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions how, and where he will have them for the future diſpoſed of, in an eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of weal, and woe, God grant that our ſouls may ſo return to God: as never to return from him; but abide with him in endleſs happineſs. O conſider the worth of your ſoul and value them accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, 16.26. <hi>What is a man profited if he ſhall gain the whole World, and looſe his own Soul?</hi> But Saint <hi>Luke</hi> Chap. 9.25. hath it, <hi>if he gain the whole World, and looſe himſelf.</hi> His body is without him, only an appendant, and that ſeperable, but his <hi>Soul</hi> is his <hi>very ſelf,</hi> looſe that looſe all.</p>
                  <p>There lived lately in the City of <hi>Exeter,</hi> a perſon well known; generally remitted <pb n="547" facs="tcp:47453:281"/>by all a right religious man, though in my mind more to be commended for his <hi>devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> then <hi>diſcretion;</hi> his cuſtome was to apply himſelf to ſtrangers in all companies, and ſequeſtring perſons by themſelves demanded of them; <hi>If you die at this inſtant what aſſurance have you of the eternal ſalvation of your Soul.</hi> A queſtion which hath poſed many a great Scholar, to give a good anſwer, with truth and comfort thereunto.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs his <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was better then his <hi>civility,</hi> in ſurprizing people with ſo ſudden an Interrogatory. However it is a queſtion, if not fit for him to ask of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, fit for every man to demand of himſelf, the <hi>Preacher</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in their <hi>Pewes,</hi> the <hi>Taveller</hi> on his <hi>Horſe,</hi> the <hi>decumbent</hi> in his bed, every one at all times, in all places.</p>
                  <p>Now it is not the leaſt part of Gods mercy unto us, that before our bodies after our deaths, finally return to duſt, they even whilſt we are living, begin for to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and to diſpoſe themſelves, for their <hi>duſty diſſolution; David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>I will bleſs the Lord who hath given me warning, my reins alſo inſtruct me in the night ſeaſon.</hi> He ſpeaketh this in relation to his mortality, it following ſoon after, <hi>my fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God gave <hi>David</hi> warning, that death ſhould not <hi>ſurprize him</hi> of his <hi>mortal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> his <hi>reins,</hi> that is ſome inward waſtings, and ſecret weakneſs of nature, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that he muſt return to his firſt original; God in like manner gives us warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and may we have wiſdome to take it, ſome years before our eye-ſtrings break, our eyes are blind as to ſmall prints, our ears deaf as to love ſounds, evident moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that our bodies are <hi>ungiving to return to duſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God of his goodneſs ſanctifie unto us, all decayes in nature, that they may effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mind us of our mortality; it is ſaid of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> when his hair was cut off, <hi>Jud.</hi> 1.6.20. <hi>He awoke out of his ſleep &amp; ſaid, I will go out as at other times before, and ſhake my ſelf,</hi> but he quickly found the caſe was altered with him. Thus we in our decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning age think to riſe as early, go as late, run as faſt, travel as far, do all things as actively as twenty years ago, when we were young; but it will not be, age hath clipt our ſtrength; God make us ſenſible thereof, <hi>that we may remember our end, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our hearts unto wiſdome, AMEN.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two great names concealed in this Text, but expreſs'd by the Prophet <hi>David</hi> in a peculiar and eminent manner: <hi>Thou haſt with thine arm redeemed thy people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 77.15.</note> 
                  <hi>the Sons of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob and Joſeph.</hi> Great was the name of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but all his Sons were not accepted; only <hi>Iſaac</hi> was in the Cevenant. Great was the name of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but his Son <hi>Eſau</hi> was rejected. Great then muſt the name of <hi>Jacob</hi> be, who had twelve Sons, and all accepted. The whole people of God deſcended from him, and were called <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as his by generation from his loins. One of theſe twelve was <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the reſt did equally deſcend from him, and might be called his Sons by preſervation, from his care and power. Howſoever, he is exempted from the number of his Brethren; and that he might be ſtyl'd a Father, two Sons of his are numbred with his Fathers Sons, and ranked with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs. Thus were all the people of God <hi>the Sons of Jacob and Joſeph;</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> while the Son of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Father of the Sons of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Theſe are the two concealed in the Text; <hi>Jacob</hi> the Father, and that Father dead; <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Son, and that a mourning Son: for <hi>he made a mourning for his Father ſeven dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words contain a brief relation of a <hi>Patriarchal Funeral;</hi> in which two general parts are preſented to our view; The Solemnization of the Obſequies; and, The Continuation of the Solemnities. In the deſcription of the Solemnization there are four particulars obſervable; The Connexion; The Perſon; The Action; The Occaſion. The Connexion, in the conjunctive particle <hi>And;</hi> the Perſon underſtood in the following pronoun <hi>He:</hi> the Action repreſented, what <hi>He,</hi> that is, <hi>Joſeph</hi> did, <hi>he made a mourning:</hi> The Occaſion expreſſed, for whom he mourned, <hi>for his Father.</hi> The Connexion of the Text is double, in reference to the Perſon, and in relation to the Action. The Connexion of the Perſon, <hi>And he;</hi> the Connexion of the Action with the precedent actions of that perſon, <hi>And he made a mourning.</hi> I ſhall begin with the Connexion of the Perſon, and in my whole diſcourſe exactly proſecute the method of the Text.</p>
               <p>When aged <hi>Jacob yeelded up the Ghoſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49.33.50.2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and was gathered unto his people, the <pb n="550" facs="tcp:47453:283"/>Phyſitians embalmed</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the</hi> Egyptians <hi>mourned for him threeſcore and ten dayes.</hi> They were not as yet the apparent enemies of God; they had their tears for <hi>Jacob,</hi> who afterward would have drowned all his Sons; they preſerved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed the dayes of his life; and when thoſe were cut off, they continued the dayes of his weeping. But there is a difference between a formal and a real ſorrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a ſolemn and a ſerious grief, between a popular and a filial ſadneſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Joſeph</hi> is not contented with the <hi>Egyptian</hi> mourning; he hath a nearer rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then thoſe ſtrangers had, and therefore more of affection is expected from him; his filial ſympathy muſt go beyond their accuſtomed civility; the <hi>Egyptians</hi> mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>and he made a mourning for his Father.</hi> This is the Connexion in reſpect of the Perſon; that of the action followeth.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jacob</hi> was near the time of his diſſolution, <hi>Joſeph</hi> put his hand under his thigh, and ſware unto him that he would deal kindly and truly with him, that he would bury him in the burying place of his Fathers.
<note place="margin">Gen. 50: 1.</note> When he gathered up his feet into the bed and dyed, <hi>Joſeph fell on his Fathers face, and wept upon him, and kiſſed him,</hi> and ſo paid the firſt fruits of a Funeral with his eyes and with his lips. After this be commanded the Phyſitians to follow with Spices and embalm him, deſirous to preſerve that body to the utmoſt poſſibility from corruption, from which he had received his generation. Then he entreated and obtained leave of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Oath which he ſware unto <hi>Jacob:</hi> he went up to the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to take poſſeſſion with his Fathers body,
<note place="margin">Gen: 49: 31.</note> and laid him in the field which <hi>Abraham</hi> bought. <hi>There they buried</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Sarah <hi>his wife, there they buried</hi> I ſaac <hi>and</hi> Rebekah <hi>his wife, there</hi> Jacob <hi>buried</hi> Leah, and there <hi>Joſeph</hi> buried <hi>Jacob.</hi> And having thus fulfilled all the duties belonging to a Son, there remaining but this one, fitter to be performed then required, <hi>he made a mourning for his Father.</hi> This is the Connexion of the Action.</p>
               <p>The Perſon or chief mourner then is <hi>Joſeph;</hi> he which once was dead in the thoughts of <hi>Jacob</hi> and deſires of his brethren, ſurvives his Father to attend his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and to preſerve his Brethren alive. His coming into <hi>Egypt</hi> coſt aged <hi>Jacob</hi> many a tear; and he muſt paſs into <hi>Canaan</hi> to demonſtrate his gratitude, and pay that debt unto his Father there. This eminent Perſon is propoſed for an example un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all ages of the world: what he here performed, was no legal Ceremony; he was a Patriarch, and long before the Law: he was a ſingular and ſignal type of Chriſt, and hath done nothing which may misbecome the moſt retired and ſublimed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</p>
               <p>And this will readily appear, if we joyn the Action to the Perſon. <hi>He made a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> I call't an Action, which may as well be term'd a Paſſion: as <hi>a mourning,</hi> ſo a Paſſion; as <hi>he made</hi> it, ſo an Action: a paſſionate Action, or an active paſſion. The internal grief of his mind and ſorrow of his heart, as an inward paſſion of his Soul, was voluntarily rais'd within him by reſolved and continued thoughts of his Fathers death; and at the ſame time the expreſſion of that grief was willingly poured Forth, as what he underſtood did well become him. We are not only to bewail our ſins, but all thoſe miſeries which proceed from them: and therefore tears were not only lent us to declare Compunction, but alſo to expreſs Commiſeration. We read our bleſſed Saviour twice did weep, once for the ſins of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> once for the death of <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom he loved. Two eyes Nature beſtow'd upon us, though perfectly &amp; diſtinctly we can ſee but with one at once, and both are equally made the fountains of tears, as we are ſinners for Contrition, as we are Brethren for Compaſſion. When the firſt Martyrs bloud was ſhed for the Chriſtian faith, <hi>devout men carryed</hi> Steven <hi>to his burial, and made great lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over him;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 8.2.</note> ſuch were the tears of the Infant Church. When <hi>Peter</hi> found <hi>Dorcas,</hi> a woman full of good works and Almſdeeds, dead, <hi>all the Widdows ſtood by him weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Thus the firſt which dyed in Chriſtianity, were followed with ſolemn tears: and it was a wiſe obſervation made by the Apoſtate <hi>Julian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act, 9.39.</note> that one of the means to convert ſo many Heathens to our Religion, was the care of the bodies, and the ſolemnities alwayes uſed at the Funerals of the dead. Thus far of the Action, <hi>He made a mourning.</hi>

The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of his paſſion, the object of his grief, the cauſe of his tears was his Father, <hi>And he made a mourning for his Father.</hi> This was ſo truly the occaſion, that it was the only cauſe, that there can be no reaſon imaginable aſſigned why <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhould mourn, but only becauſe he had loſt a Father. Though he was aged to extremity, though he was holy unto eminency, though he was happy to eternity, though no way diſadvantageous by his death to any, yet becauſe dead, and that a Father dead, <hi>he made a mourning for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We uſually ſay of ancient Perſons, that they have already one foot in the grave, and the reſt of their life is nothing elſe but the bringing of theſe feet together. Why then ſhould we weep for the death of aged perſons, when it can be but the ſecond part of their Funeral? That ſorrow ſeems to be but uſeleſs which is ſpent upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 90.20.</note> and that grief irrational which would create impoſſibilities. <hi>The dayes of our years are threeſcore years and ten, and if by reaſon of ſtrength they be fourſcore years, yet is their ſtrength labour and ſorrow.</hi> What reaſon then can we produce, that the life of a man whom we eſteem, ſhould be ſorrow to himſelf, and his death be grief to us? Now <hi>Jacob</hi> gave this account of his age to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when he came down to <hi>Egypt, The dayes of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years;</hi> and he <hi>lived in the land ſeventeen years;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 47.9.28.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo the whole age of</hi> Jacob, <hi>was an hundred forty and ſeven years.</hi> This extremity of his age had faſtned him to his bed, the perfect embleme and ſhort forerunnner of his grave.
<note place="margin">Gen. 48: 10.</note> 
                  <hi>The eyes of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were dim, ſo that he could not ſee;</hi> he was already in the ſhades of darkneſs. Nay, <hi>the time drem nigh</hi> faith <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 47.29.</note> 
                  <hi>that</hi> Iſrael <hi>muſt die;</hi> there was a natural neceſſity of his death, an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent impoſſibility of longer life; and yet this conſideration is no excuſe to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but <hi>he made a mourning for his aged Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the death of the righteous is to be deſired rather then lamented: and it were a diſhonour put upon Religion to think a pious man leſs happy dead,
<note place="margin">Lake 23, 28.</note> then when he liv'd. <hi>Weep not for me,</hi> was the language of the immaculate Lamb when he went to a ſhameful and a painful death: and why ſhould he, which yeelds up his ſoul with comfort, leave his body to be covered with ſo muſt forrow? Thoſe which live in impiety, and depart in their iniquity, they which have here provoked the wrath of God, and goe hence with that wrath abiding on them, as they could create nothing to their relations but ſorrow in their life, ſo muſt they neceſſarily increaſe it at their death. But <hi>Jacob</hi> was a Patriarch, of eminent and conſtant piety, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and remarkably belov'd of God, highly bleſſed by him, and powerfully bleſſing in his name; and yet when <hi>Jacob</hi> dyeth, <hi>Joſeph</hi> weepeth: <hi>And be made a mourning for his pious Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Death is nothing elſe but a change of a ſhort and temporary, for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable and eternal condition. From whence it followeth, that thoſe which die in their ſins, from thence begin to feel thoſe torments which ſhall never ceaſe: and therefore they leave behind them a ſad occaſion of grief and ſorrow to ſuch as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the pains they feel. If the Rich man in the Goſpel were ſo careful of his ſurviving brethren, and ſo concerned in their welfare; if they had as well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his ſad and irreverſible condition, what floods of tears would they have ſhed for him who call'd ſo earneſtly for a drop of water to cool his tongue! But as for ſuch as paſs from hence into a place of reſt and joy, who change the miſeries of this ſinful world for the bleſſed preſence of a good and gracious God; weeping at their departure, may ſeem improper and unkind officiouſneſs, as 'twere a ſorrow for their happineſs, and envy at their felicity. Now the ſoul of <hi>Jacob</hi> was certainly at reſt, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſufficiently aſſured of his happineſs. He knew that his Father was heir of the ſame promiſe with <hi>Abraham:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.10, 13, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>for he looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God;</hi> he <hi>dyed in faith, &amp; imbraced the promiſes;</hi> he <hi>confeſſed that he was a ſtranger on the earth, and that he ſought a better country, that is, an heavenly;</hi> and <hi>therefore God had prepared for him a City,</hi> &amp; he was in the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the place of felicity. But the happineſs of his ſoul is no excuſe to <hi>Joſeph</hi> for the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tears due at the interment of his body. <hi>And he made a mourning for his happy Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="552" facs="tcp:47453:284"/>Fourthly, many perſons expiring give too ſad occaſions of ſorrow to their relations left behind: they which depend upon them, whoſe ſubſiſtance liveth and dyeth, and whoſe hopes are buried with them, may go to their graves with unfeigned tears, lamenting not ſo much the departure of their friend, as their own loſs; ſomething they may weep for them, and more for themſelves. But the death of <hi>Jacob</hi> was not of any ſuch condition; there could no diſadvantage ariſe from that to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> no intereſt of his could ſuffer by it. He had already bleſſed all his Sons, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally; there could be no more of heavenly favours expected from his prayers or propheſies. Had he dyed before he laid his hands upon <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeth,</hi> had <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Sons been abſent when he bleſſed the reſt, he might have ſadly mourned for the loſs of his Father, and of the Benediction. If <hi>Eſau</hi> lift up his voyce and wept, becauſe he was defeated of the bleſſing while <hi>Iſaac</hi> lived, <hi>Joſeph</hi> might well have made a mourning, had he been prevented of the Benediction by an unexpected or a diſtant death. But <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed them, and with his bleſſing gave order for his burial, and with that bleſſing and that order dyed. And as his death was no way prejudicial to the ſpiritual, ſo was it not at all diſadvantageous to the temporal condition of his Son. He ſuffered loſs of no enjoyments by his Fathers death; <hi>Jacob</hi> had lived long by the favour and the care of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> his filial gratitude alone preſerv'd his life; but no ſuch narrow thoughts abated the freeneſs of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s forrow. <hi>And he made a mourning for his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If none of theſe conſiderations, which work ſo powerfully on other perſons, did move this Mourner to expreſs ſuch ſorrow, what were the Motives then which caus'd ſo deep a ſenſe, what meditations wrought ſo powerfully on the heart of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph?</hi> I anſwer, they were but two, Mortality, and Paternity; the one ſuppoſed, the other expreſſed in the text: <hi>Jacob</hi> was the Father of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and that Father dead, and therefore <hi>Joſeph</hi> mourned for him.</p>
               <p>Mortality is a proper object to invite our pity, and privation of life alone ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to move compaſſion in the living. <note place="margin">Eccl. 22. If.</note> 
                  <hi>Weep for the dead,</hi> faith the Son of <hi>Sirach, for he hath loſt the light.</hi> If for no other reaſon, yet becauſe a man is dead, and by death deprived of thoſe comforts which thoſe that live enjoy, they which ſurvive may providently bewail their future privation in his preſent loſs. Thus every Grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone beſpeaks or expects a tear; as if all thoſe eyes which had not yet loſt their light, were to pay the tribute of their waters to the dead Sea. This Fountain Nature never made in vain, nor to be alwayes ſealed up; that heart is rock which ſuffers it never to break forth; and be it ſo, yet if the rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtrike, an affliction ſent from God ſhall force it. Let us therefore be ready with our ſorrowful expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when we are invited by ſad occaſions; eſpecially when a Father, who may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, calls for them, as that Wiſe man did, <hi>My Son, let tears fall down over the dead.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 38.16.</note> And if paternal authority demands them at the death of others, it is no filial duty which denies them to attend upon a Fathers Funeral. <hi>Joſeph</hi> a man of a gracious and a tender heart, moved with common objects of compaſſion, had a vulgar forrow ariſing from the conſideration of mortality; <hi>Joſeph</hi> a Son full of high affection and of filial duty and reſpect, was touched with a far more lively ſenſe by the acceſſion of paternity: <hi>And he made a mourning for his Father:</hi> he made a mourning for his Father, which begat him; for his Father, which loved him; for his Father, which bleſſed him; for his Father, which had mourned for him; for his Father, which came down to die with him.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>he made a mourning for his Father</hi> who begat him: had there been no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but that naked relation, it had carryed with it a ſufficient obligation. There is ſo great an union between the Parent and the Child, that it cannot break without a deep ſenſation. He which hath any grateful apprehenſion of his own life received, cannot chuſe but ſadly reſent the loſs of that life which gave it. If the fear of the death of <hi>Croeſus,</hi> by a natural miracle could unty the tongue of his Son who never ſpake before; that man muſt be miraculouſly unnatural, the flood-gates of whoſe eyes are not open'd at his Fathers Funerals, though he never wept before. The gifts of grace do not obliterate, but improve nature; and it is a falſe perſwaſion of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, which teacheth us ſo far to become the ſons of God, as to forget that we <pb n="553" facs="tcp:47453:284"/>are the ſons of men. <hi>Joſeph</hi> a perſon high in the eſteem of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> higher in the favour of God, great in the power of <hi>Egypt,</hi> greater in the power of the Spirit, yet he forgets not his filial relation, yet he cannot deny his natural obligation, but as a pious Son, he payes the laſt tribute of his duty to <hi>Jacob; And he made a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his Father,</hi> who begat him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>he made a mourning for his Father,</hi> who loved him. Love, when in an equal, commandeth love; and this is ſo juſt, that fire doth not more naturally create a flame. In this the ſimilitude is ſo great, that there is no difference in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the love produced, and that which did produce it. But when it firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in a ſuperior perſon, the proper effect which it createth in an inferior, is not of a ſingle nature, but ſuch a love as is mingled with duty and reſpect. The love of God to man challengeth love from us, but that of ſuch a nature as cannot be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but by obedience; and that of a Father to his Son is of the ſame condition, though not in the ſame proportion. The Father loveth, firſt with care and tenderneſs, with a proper and a ſingle love; the Son returns it with another colour mingled with du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, blended with reſpect. Now <hi>Jacob</hi> had many children, and as an eminent example he lov'd them all: but among the reſt, there was one clearer and warmer flame; for <hi>be loved</hi> Joſeph <hi>more then all his children:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 37.3.</note> the off-ſpring of <hi>Rachel,</hi> the Son of his old age, the Heir of his Vertues, the Corrector of his Brethren, the Beloved of God, had a greater ſhare in <hi>Jacobs</hi> affection then the reſt of his iſſue. He did not ſo much prefer his wives before his hand maids, he did not ſo highly value <hi>Rachel</hi> before <hi>Leah,</hi> as he did eſteem <hi>Joſeph</hi> before the off-ſpring of them all. This was the paternal love of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and this was anſwered with as high a filial reſpect in <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph;</hi> which after death could not otherwiſe be expreſſed then in tears; <hi>And</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>he made a mourning for his Father,</hi> who loved him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>he made a mourning for his Father,</hi> who had bleſſed him. Bleſſing is the ſoveraign act of God, and the power of benediction like the power of God. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legateth this power unto his Prieſts, who ſtand between God and Man, and bleſs the Sons of men in the name of God. He derives the ſame upon our natural Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that children honoring them may expect his bleſſing upon their deſires and prayers. And what greater favour could we ask of God, then that thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have the moſt natural affection toward us, ſhould alſo have the greateſt power to bleſs us? Now when <hi>the time drew nigh that</hi> Iſrael <hi>muſt die,</hi> when his body drew nearer to the Earth, and his ſoul to Heaven, when his deſires were higheſt, and his words of the greateſt efficacy, <hi>he called unto his Sons, and bleſſed them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49.1, 48.</note> 
                  <hi>every one according to his bleſſing he bleſſed them.</hi> But as he <hi>loved</hi> Joſeph <hi>more then all his Brethren,</hi> ſo he bleſſed him above them all: he made one Tribe of every Son, and two of him: his affection ſhew'd it ſelf Rhetorical in his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, ſaying, <hi>The bleſſings of thy Father have prevailed above the bleſſings of my Progenitors: unto the utmoſt bounds of the everlaſting hills they ſhall be on the head of</hi> Joſeph,
<note place="margin">Gen. 49.26.</note> 
                  <hi>and on the crown of the head of him that was ſeparate from his Brethren.</hi> Giving this Benediction, <hi>Jacob</hi> dies; receiving this Bleſſing, <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſurvives, who can render no other Retribution after his death, but care of his Burial, and tears at his Funeral. <hi>And</hi> therefore <hi>he made a mourning for his Father,</hi> who had bleſſed him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>he made a mourning for his Father,</hi> who had mourned for him. The Parents cares and fears are equal, and when any infelicity betides their children, their grieſs are great;
<note place="margin">Gen. 37.34.</note> and all theſe bear a proportion with their love. Now the love of <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Joſeph</hi> was tranſcendent, and being ſo, it rais'd as high an hatred in the hearts of his Brethren; by which he was, in their intention, and in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers opinion, dead. And now the Funeral is <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s, let us ſee how <hi>Jacob</hi> does appear.
<note place="margin">Gen. 37.35.</note> 
                  <hi>He rent his clothes, and put ſackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his Son many dayes.</hi> Here is a real demonſtration upon a ſuppoſed death, and a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mourning at a feigned Funeral. Had his deareſt Son been dead, yet he might well take comfort in his numerous off-ſpring, but he did not; for <hi>all his Sons and all his daughters roſe up to comfort him; but he refuſed to be comforted: and he ſaid, for I will go down into the grave unto my Son mourning; thus his Father wept for him.</hi> 
                  <pb n="554" facs="tcp:47453:285"/>Thus it pleaſeth God to permit this happy deceit of envious Brethren, this pious miſtake of an affectionate Father, not only for a great example of Paternal love, but alſo to teach all Sons to meaſure their griefs at their Fathers death, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe ſorrows which their Parents would have expreſſed, had they dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before them. Howſoever <hi>Joſeph</hi> was but juſt in this: <hi>he made a mourning for his Father,</hi> who had mourn'd for him.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>he made a mourning for his Father,</hi> who came down to die with him. It was the old expreſſion of Parents comfort, that at their deaths they might have their children to cloſe their eyes; and it hath been equally the deſire of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be made happy by that occaſion, in ſhewing the laſt teſtimony of their duty at their Parents Death. Now <hi>Jacob</hi> who upon the ſuppoſed death of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> had ſaid,
<note place="margin">Gen. 37.35.</note> 
                  <hi>I will go down into the Grave unto my Son;</hi> upon the certain intelligence of his life and ſafety, reſolveth to go down and die with him. For <hi>when he ſaw the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons which</hi> Joſeph <hi>ſent,</hi> and his <hi>ſpirit revived,</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid, it is enough:</hi> Joſeph <hi>my Son is yet alive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 45.27.28.</note> 
                  <hi>I will go and ſee him before I die:</hi> and when <hi>Joſeph</hi> firſt <hi>preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf unto him</hi> in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the firſt words he ſpake were theſe, <hi>Now let me die, ſince I have ſeen thy face, becauſe thou art yet alive.</hi> Now he which ſaid at firſt,
<note place="margin">Gen. 46.30.</note> 
                  <hi>I will go and ſee him before I die,</hi> and when he ſaw him, ſaid, <hi>Now let me die,</hi> reſolved nothing in that journey but to die with <hi>Joſeph. And he made a mourning for his Father,</hi> who came down to die with him.</p>
               <p>For all theſe reaſons <hi>Joſeph</hi> mourned; <hi>for his Father,</hi> who begat him, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his natural generation; <hi>for his Father,</hi> who loved him, not forgetting his ſingular affection; <hi>for his Father,</hi> who had bleſſed him, conſidering his double Benediction; <hi>for his Father,</hi> who had mourned for him, meditating a pious retaliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>for his Father,</hi> who came down to die with him, embracing the opportunity of a dutiful expreſſion. And thus I cloſe up the firſt general part of the Text, or the Solemnization of the Obſequies.</p>
               <p>The Second general Part of the ſame, preſents us with the Continuation of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity. Which miniſters a double Conſideration, one as conſiſting of not many dayes, the other as determining how many dayes. <hi>And he made a mourning for his Father ſeven dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Immediately after <hi>Jacobs</hi> death in <hi>Egypt,</hi> forty dayes were fulfilled for his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming, <hi>and the</hi> Egyptians <hi>mourned for him threeſcore and ten dayes.</hi> They which have no hope of a life to come, may extend their griefs for the loſs of this, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual the dayes of their mourning with the years of the life of man. But ſo tedious a Funeral Solemnity is a tacite profeſſion of Inſidelity.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 34:8.</note> When <hi>Moſes</hi> went up into the Mountain of <hi>Nebo,</hi> and dyed there, <hi>the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>wept for him in the plains of</hi> Moab <hi>thirty dayes.</hi> The plains of <hi>Moab</hi> were nearer to the Land of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe then <hi>Egypt</hi> was, and ſome light of the joyes of the life to come was diſcovered under the Law, and therefore more then half of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Solemnity was cut off by the Faith of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> But this Patriarchal Funeral was made in <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of promiſe, the Type of Heaven; it was appointed by <hi>Joſeph</hi> a bleſſed Patriarch, and a Type of Chriſt: it continued ſome dayes, to declare his natural affection, but thoſe not many, to expreſs his religious expectation. Had it been extended longer, it had demonſtrated more of duty, but leſs of faith, he had ſhew'd himſelf more a Son, but leſs a Patriarch. But now he is become a great Example, in mourning ſome dayes, of filial duty; in mourning few dayes, of Divinity. Which is our firſt Conſideration.</p>
               <p>The Second leads us to the determinate number of the dayes, which are expreſly. Seven. <hi>And he made a mourning for his Father ſeven dayes.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> took ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of this act of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> obſerved the number of theſe dayes,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 22.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Seven dayes do men mourn for him that is dead,</hi> faith the Son of <hi>Sirach;</hi> and though it be not unto us a law, yet it is a proper ſubject of our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <p>It was afterward one of the laws of <hi>Moſes, He that toucheth the dead body of any man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 19.11.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall be unclean ſeven dayes.</hi> And therefore well did <hi>Joſeph</hi> teach the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> to mourn the ſame number of dayes, that with their tears of natural affection, <pb n="555" facs="tcp:47453:285"/>they might mingle ſome thoughts of their natural pollution.</p>
               <p>Again,
<note place="margin">Exod. 20.11. Gen. 2.2.</note> the number of Seven is the number of reſt, <hi>In ſix dayes the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is:</hi> and <hi>he reſted on the Seventh day from all his works which he had made.</hi> Now <hi>Joſeph</hi> knew that there <hi>remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a reſt to the people of God,</hi> he was fully aſſured that as the dayes of the years of his Fathers pilgrimage were evil, ſo they ended in reſt and happineſs: that as ſure as his body was paſt all wearineſs and pain, ſo his ſoul was placed above all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of grief or ſorrow. A Dove brought <hi>Noah</hi> word into the Ark that <hi>waters were on the face of the Earth,</hi> and he ſtay'd ſeven dayes, and then the Dove ſent forth returned,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.9. Il.</note> 
                  <hi>and loe, in her mouth was an Olive leaf pluckt off, ſo</hi> Noah <hi>knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.</hi> If we mourn for the death of any perſon departed, and the waters appear upon the face of man, yet after the ſeventh day, when the Olive leaf is pluckt, when we have conſidered the peace, and reſt, and joyes of the ſouls departed in the fear of God, 'tis time for the waters to abate, for mourning to ceaſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the number of Seven is the number of holineſs: as God reſted the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day,
<note place="margin">Gen. 2.3.</note> ſo <hi>bleſſed, and hallowed it.</hi> Seven dayes Aaron and his Sons the Prieſts were conſecrated; ſeven dayes an Attonement was made, and the Altar was ſanctified. Seven dayes hath <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſet apart for his Fathers Funeral, to ſhew that mourning for the dead is ſomething ſacred, the tenth of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> mourning, an act of Piety, a part of Religion. The <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved that the Circumciſion was deſerred till the eighth day, that a Sabbath might paſs upon the child, and ſo ſanctifie it before it was circumciſed; and <hi>Joſeph</hi> appointeth ſeven dayes for mourning, one of which muſt neceſſarily be that day which God bleſſed and ſanctified in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to procure a bleſſing upon that duty, and to ſanctifie his ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Upon which ſeaſonable Conſideration I ſhall take leave to conclude my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Text, and apply my ſelf to the preſent Solemnity, which gave the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to conſider it: that I may make ſuch uſe of the work of this holy day, as may ſanctifie the ſorrow of it.</p>
               <p>And now, moſt Honorable Sir, the <hi>Joſeph</hi> of this time, the chief Mourner of this day, be pleaſed to endeavour the Sanctification of your mourning, by theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexive Meditations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, learn from hence to meditate upon your own Mortality, and be now aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by this neer and home example, that your ſelf ſhall die. This may ſeem but a cold monition, but a dull reflection; every Grave preacheth that Doctrime, and every Skeleton readeth as good a Lecture: when we come into the Houſe of God, our feet will learn thus much, and the ground we tread upon will thus far inſtruct us. 'Tis true, the examples of our mortality are numerous, but they are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually efficacious; the nearer our relations are to thoſe which die, the more we are concerned in their death,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12, 7.</note> and there is none ſo neer in his concernment as that of the Father and Son. There is a difference between the language of the Scriptures, and ſuch a Prophet as <hi>Nathan</hi> was; one tells us that <hi>all men are ſinners,</hi> the other ſays, <hi>thou art the man.</hi> So common Funerals tell us all men are mortal, but that of a Father ſpeaketh not only plainly, but particularly, thou art ſo. From his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity the Son receiveth life, and in his death muſt read his own departure. 'Tis poſſible to imagine an immortal family, and then the deaths of others concern'd that not: but where the Father's dead, there can be no pretence or thought of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. Beſide there's ſomething more then propinquity of nature in a Father: Religion teacheth us that our dayes are otherwiſe bound up in our Parents lives. Remember the <hi>firſt Commandement with Promiſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Honorthy Father and thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that thy dayes may be long in the land:</hi> conſider that you have loſt in his death all further opportunity of improving the hopes of that promiſe; and that you ſtand now only, as to him, upon what comfort you have in your former duty, and in your paſt obedience. Thus learn to fix a more immediate and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning meditation of your own mortality, upon the death of him, in whoſe life yours was involved both by a natural and ſpiritual dependance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, reflect upon that love and entire affection which you have loſt; and <pb n="556" facs="tcp:47453:286"/>could no otherwiſe be loſt, but by loſing him, in whom it lived. Love is of that excellent nature, that it is eſteemed by the beſt of men, and accepted from the meaneſt perſons; what then is the affection of a Father! what is the purity of that fire which God and Nature kindles in the breſt of man! what were the flames which ever burnt upon the Altar of your Fathers heart, who never hated any man! See but the nature of Paternal love in <hi>David;</hi> who, when <hi>Abſalom,</hi> his Son, but a moſt rebellious Son,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.22.</note> openly ſought his life and Crown, and dyed in that unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral attempt, <hi>went up into his chamber and wept, and as he went, thus he ſaid, O my Son</hi> Abſalom, <hi>my Son, my Son</hi> Abſalom; <hi>would God I had dyed for thee, O</hi> Abſalom <hi>my Son, my Son:</hi> Meaſure by this example the affection you have ſo lately loſt, who never gave any offence as <hi>Abſalom</hi> did, and yet had in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eye all the reaſons of love which <hi>Abſalom</hi> could have. Know then you make a mourning, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did, for a Father that loved you: remember that the love of <hi>Jacob</hi> was divided between twelve Sons, and therefore, though it was high, it could not be whole and entire to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as for many years your Fathers hath been unto you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſpeak not this out of deſign to renew or advance your grief, to tell you what you have loſt alone; but I propound this privation, that I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive it for your imitation, endeavouring to ſtir up the ſame fire, and to kindle the ſame affection in your ſelf, who now are wholly to be conſidered in the ſame rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What you were to him, others are now to you; and what he was to you, you are now wholly unto them. Before your natural affection was partly taken up with duty, reſpect, honour and obedience, due to a Father from a Son; it is now taken off from thoſe expreſſions, as to him, that it may deſcend the more entire upon thoſe which come from you, as you from him. Thus far you have been the <hi>Joſeph</hi> of the Text, be now the <hi>Jacob;</hi> that thoſe two great names may be concealed not only in the Text, but in your breaſt. Thus far you have been the better part of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> learn now to be the <hi>David:</hi> that we may truly ſay, that tender affection, that Paternal love, dyed not with your Father, but ſurvives in you to your and his poſterity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I deſire you to look not only upon that which you have loſt, but alſo upon that which he hath left behind him. Vulgar and common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as they carry nothing out of this world, ſo they leave nothing in it: they receive no eminency in their birth, they acquire none in their life, they have none when they die, they leave none a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

But honorable perſons, as they die like common men, ſo that only dyeth with them which was common unto all degrees of men; their ſingular reſpects, the priviledges of their greatneſs, their honors ſurvive them, and deſcend unto their Heirs with their Inheritance. Give me leave then yet to ſpeak unto you as to the Heir of your Fathers Honors; conſider what the nature and deſign of honors are; remember they were firſt graciouſly conferred as a reward of the vertues of your Anceſtors, and were as wiſely continued upon a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as an encouragement, of the ſame vertures in their Succeſſors. Your Honor knows how long the greatneſs of your Family hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: acknowledg firſt the vigilant providence and infinite goodneſs of God in the preſervation of it, while ſo many glorious Titles have been loſt, ſo many Noble Families cut off. Next, ſtudy to preſerve and advance it further by the exerciſe of thoſe vertues upon which it was firſt built, and hath been ſince continued: endeavour to uphold not only your own, but the very name of Honor in this Age, in which partly the want of ſuch vertues as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſupport it, partly the weakneſs of that power which firſt gave life unto it, partly the unreaſonableneſs of fooliſh men who endeavour to caſt a diſ-eſteem up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, have too much eclipſed the glory of it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,

There is ſo much deceitfulneſs in the heart of man, ſo much hypocriſie in Funeral mourning, that you may bleſs God for your own aſſurance of the ſincerity of your natural affection, and religious reſpect to your Parents, and take delight in a juſt expectation, that it will be rewarded by the future reſpect of your children. So having performed the duty of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who made a mourning for his Father,
<note place="margin">Gen. 49.22.</note> you may expect the bleſſing of <hi>Joſeph</hi> given by the mouth of <hi>Jacob</hi> for whom he mourned, <hi>Joſeph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a Well, whoſe branches run over the Wall.</hi> That this Benediction may be your Honors portion, ſhall be my conſtant prayer, <hi>By the God of thy Father who ſhall help thee, and by the Almighty, who ſhall bleſs thee with bleſſings of heaven above, bleſſings of the deep that lyeth under, bleſſings of the breaſts and of the womb.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>

We want no teaching to ſet us forwards in the wayes of wickedneſs, but in the performance of the leaſt good, we are not able to move one ſtep, without the guidance and direction of the holy Spirit of God. Therefore it is a good prayer of <hi>David</hi> for every one of us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.10. <hi>Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God; thy Spirit is good, lead meinte the land of uprightneſs.</hi> There are many Teachers abroad in the world, and more than know how to teach aright; and there are many Doctrines which are dayly preſt and intruded upon the weak and ſimple, and more than are uſeful and ſaving: But there is but <hi>Unum neceſſarium,</hi> one thing that is needful, one thing in ſpecial to be minded and looked after, even ſo to live, as that we may become wiſe for Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo to walk on earth, as that we may be fitted for Heaven. This is the main Doctrine we are to learn, and our Inſtructer is God. We have none to teach us but God, and we have no other way to implore this favour of God, but by our prayers in the words of <hi>Moſes; So teach us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You know the Penman of this Pſalm by the Inſcription, <hi>A Prayer of Moſes the man of God;</hi> and I think it is ſafer to keep to the letter of the Text, than to buſie your thoughts with the various and doubtful conjectures we meet with in ancient and modern Expoſitors.</p>
               <p>The Text is a Prayer to God to teach us the true Art of Arithmetick, to make us true Accountants for Heaven, how we may know to number our dayes aright. In this Prayer we meet with two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, what he begs of God; 1. To number his dayes. 2. To be taught this duty. 3. To be taught it in ſuch a manner; <hi>So teach us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the end wherefore he begs this of God, <hi>That we may apply,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The end is the gain of true wiſdome, to make us wiſe for Heaven. And here we have,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The kind and nature of this wiſdome, what this wiſdome is, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> 
                  <pb n="560" facs="tcp:47453:288"/>here ſpeaks, and that is in making the beſt proviſion we can for the eternal welfare of our Souls.</p>

               <p n="3">3. The means of obtaining this wiſdome, and that is by the conſideration and thought of Death. By the careful numbring of our dayes we attain this wiſdome. The meditation of Death makes us truly wiſe.</p>
               <p>Before we faſten upon the Text, we will take a ſurvey of the Context, which ſtands thus:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Obſerve, <hi>Moſes</hi> having ſpoken of the wrath of God in the foregoing verſe, <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, ſo is thy wrath;</hi> of the ſudden he betakes himſelf to prayer. The thought and conſideration of Gods anger makes us to pray.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve here, after that <hi>Moſes</hi> had given us a deſcription of the wrath of God, preſently his thoughts are taken up with the meditation of Death. The wrath of <hi>God</hi> thought on, makes us to think of Death.</p>

The fear of this quickned the devotion of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.3. <hi>And Jehoſhaphat feared, and ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord.</hi> He feared, therefore he prayed. The thought of <hi>Gods</hi> anger may well bring us upon our knees, and when danger approacheth,

The Romans made <hi>Fear</hi> a god, and worſhiped it for a god; the Indians worſhip the Devil, for fear he ſhould hurt them; and all this ſhews us, what a command fear hath over the hearts of men to make them to pray. They that never think of God in the day of proſperity, will haſten to call upon him in the day of trouble. The text ſayes, <hi>When the ſhip was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſink, the marriners were afraid, and every man cryed unto his God,</hi> Joh. 1.5. A man will never ſooner acknowledg a Deity, then in the midſt of his fears. Such is the baſe ſpirit of man, as that the long-ſufferance and patience of God makes ſome men turn meer Atheiſts.
<note place="margin">Tertul. de pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eut. c. 2.</note> Therefore it is that ſo many believe there is no <hi>God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian, quia ſeculo iratum, tam diu neſciunt,</hi> becauſe they do not ſee that <hi>God</hi> is angry with the World; they feel not the wrath of <hi>God,</hi> therefore they conclude he is no <hi>God;</hi> and as long as <hi>God</hi> holds off from puniſhing, they hold off from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His Judgments prove him a <hi>God,</hi> when his Mercies cannot perſwade the world ſo much. Every man haſtens to ſeek the Lord when he is angry; his Juſtice terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies us, his Mercy hardens us; his Goodneſs makes us to rebel, his Anger teacheth us to pray; we forget <hi>God</hi> when he is gracious, and fly amain to him when he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens.</p>
               <p>Let us often think of the wrath of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</note> and let the thought of it ſo far work upon us, as to keep us in a conſtant awe and fear of <hi>God;</hi> and let this fear drive us to <hi>God</hi> by prayer, that fearing as we ought, we may pray as we are commanded, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may prevent the wrath of <hi>God.</hi> If our preſent ſorrows do not move us, <hi>God</hi> will ſend greater; and when our ſorrows are grown too great for us, we ſhall have little heart or comfort to pray. Let our fears then quicken our prayers, and let our prayers be ſuch as are able to avercome our fears: ſo both wayes ſhall we be happy, in that our fears have taught us to pray, and our prayers have made us to fear no more. Now is the time for us to pray, before grief wax too ſtrong for us; for the time may come, when we ſhall not be able to pray, by reaſon of the ſenſe and feeling of the wrath of God upon us. Now our prayers in the time of health may be as Incenſe before the Lord, as a ſweet odour in the noſtrils of God: but if we neglect to offer up this Incenſe, we muſt look for the Incenſe of Vengeance to fall down upon us, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 8.5. If God take the Cenfer in his hand, and fill it with the fire of his wrath, then follows nothing but thundrings, lightnings, and terrible commotions in the Soul.

Therefore before the wrath of God break forth upon us, let us ſeriouſly think of it, and prevent it by our prayers: Let a timely fear incite our prayers, and quicken our devotion. This holy fear will kindle an holy devotion in our hearts, and as a watchful keeper of the heart, ſhall ſuffer no thoughts to break forth, but ſuch as ſhall amount aloſt to Heaven. As cold water makes the fire more fierce and vehement; ſo does this fear make our prayers more earneſt and ſervent. And this is our firſt Obſervation, The fear of Gods wrath drives us to our prayers, and makes us the more importunate with God for mercy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Concluſion now follows, which ariſeth, from the Context, after the prophet had given us a deſcription of the wrath of <hi>God,</hi> he pitcheth his next thoughts upon Death; And this brings in our next Obſervation.</p>
               <p>The wrath of <hi>God</hi> thought upon,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2.</note> makes us to think of Death.</p>
               <p>He that ruminates upon the wrath of <hi>God</hi> which he hath incurr'd by ſin, muſt needs think of Death, the ſad effect of ſin. When I remember how far I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the anger of a juſt <hi>God</hi> by Sin, I cannot chooſe but think of Death. This was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, who while he was under the wrath of <hi>God,</hi> and felt not the comfort of the pardon of his Sins, he did imagine there was no other way but death with him, <hi>Job</hi> 7.21. <hi>Why doſt thou not pardon my tranſgreſſion, and take away mine iniquities? for now ſhall I ſleep in the duſt, and thou ſhalt ſeek me in the morning, but I ſhall not be:</hi> As if he had ſaid, Deliver me, O Lord, from thy wrath, and grant me the pardon of my ſins, otherwiſe I am but as a dead man before thee. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of the wrath of a King, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.14. that <hi>it is as meſſengers of death;</hi> Surely then the wrath of <hi>God</hi> may very well be a Meſſenger ſent from <hi>God</hi> to put us in mind of Death. If the Wrath of man be ſo fierce, what is the wrath of <hi>God?</hi> if the frown of a King ſtrike a man dead, what power is there in the looks of an angry <hi>God</hi> to bring us to nothing? If the ſmoke of mans anger can do this, what cannot the flame of <hi>Gods</hi> wrath do, even conſume us to very aſhes?</p>
               <p>Does the fear of Gods Wrath put us in mind of Death?

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1.</note> 1. This diſcovers our own guilt, what a weight of ſin lies upon our Souls; otherwiſe, what reaſon had we to tremble at the denunciation of Gods wrath againſt us, if we were not conſcious to our ſelves of a world of wickedneſs which harbours in our breaſts? Were we not privy to a maſſe of Corruption lurking within us, the fear of death would never affright us. A ſtrong wind is able to ſhake and bend the ſtrongeſt tree, and the wrath of God will make the moſt godly man alive to quake and tremble, Imagine the eaſieſt death that is, it cannot be but that Nature will have ſome ſtruglings with it. It is impoſſible to die ſuch a death, as ſhall have no pangs to attend upon it. Thus it is even in the death of the greateſt Saints, there muſt needs be ſome ſtrivings and wreſtlings in the Conſcience with the wrath of God. The heart of no Chriſtian is ſo far quieted and appeaſed at the hour of death, as that all fear is baniſhed out of it, and a man hath not the leaſt remembrance of ſin, and of the wrath of God due to ſin, lodging in his breaſt. This holy fear is in the beſt of Gods children, and proves as an excellent preparative for death. He is beſt fitted for Death, that meditates of tenof the wrath of God due to ſin.</p>

In all the Judgments of God, <hi>Death,</hi> like the aſhes which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſprinkled, is ſcattered and caſt over all our heads. <hi>Death</hi> like the Hand-writing upon the wall, appears in all our families, and ſhews it ſelf in our houſes, and in all places we come into: whitherſoever we go, whereſoever we abide, we want not many repreſentations of Death before our eyes. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at all times and in all places think of the wrath of God, and let the conſideration <pb n="562" facs="tcp:47453:289"/>and thought of this make us to conſider and remember our latter end, that come it never ſo ſoon, this day before the next, we may not be unprovided for it.</p>
               <p>We have done with the Context: Now let us take a view of the Text it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that preſents it ſelf before us, is the matter of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Prayer, and that is to teach us the true Art of Arithmetick, and make us good Accountants in the numbring of our dayes. 1. The dayes that are paſt muſt be numbred. 2. The dayes that are yet to come. As God commanded the ſeveral manſions and places of abode, where the Iſraelites did make any ſtay, to be all numbred in a peculiar book entitled for that purpoſe, <hi>The Book of Numbers:</hi> So God would have us to take a ſpecial account of all our dayes, and to reckon up thoſe that are paſt, and thoſe that are to come; to conſider how long we have liv'd, and how long we have yet to live.</p>

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3.</note> Our dayes that are paſt muſt be numbred. <hi>David</hi> recounted the number of his dayes, and found them to be waſted to nothing, vaniſh'd away like ſmoke, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.3. <hi>My dayes are conſumed like ſmoke.</hi> Our years conſume and wear away, and every day we riſe, we draw nearer and nearer to Corruption.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt reckon with our ſelves what is ſpent of our years, how many are paſt and gone; like a man that runs a race, he looks back and conſiders how far he hath run already. A good Chriſtian calls to mind the whole courſe of his life, and counts with himſelf, how many years are gone over his head, how much time he hath loſt, and cannot be recovered again.</p>

We muſt recount with our ſelves, what is over-paſt of the goodneſs of our years, what good we have omitted, how many precious opportunities we have loſt, which we might have employed to Gods Glory, and the furtherance of our own Salvation. A good Chriſtian reckons up every ſin that is paſt, wherein he fail'd, and came ſhort of the good he might have done, how he might have amended what was amiſs, if he had not been negligent and careleſs; like an exact Limner, that looks over the Table to ſpy out what errours have eſcap'd him, and if he find any, he preſently corrects them, before he draw off his hand from the Table. The like ought we to do, and take a view of the ſeveral actions of our lives, and conſider where we have been peccant, and ſeek to amend what is defective, before we paſs out of this world, when it will be too late to caſt up our Accounts, and inſtead of numbring a few years in this life, we ſhall be forc'd to number up innumerable years of ſorrow and grief in another world.</p>

                  </note> many years to come, and yet never remember the years that are paſt; they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they have time enough to ſpare, and yet never conſider how much time they have ſpent already. The fool in the Goſpel befools himſelf with the hope of longer life, but never makes reckoning of the years that are paſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. <hi>Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years.</hi> We are good Accountants for the world, but not for ourſelves in what concerns the good of our Souls. We can count our Money, our Goods, our Lands, but not our Years, which we have miſ-ſpent in vain: we can reckon up the years of others, but not our own; we can eaſily ſum up the frailties of our brethren, but we cannot caſt up our own; we know the frailties of other men, but we are ignorant of our own. Where's the man that brings to his remembrance the ſins of his years that are paſt? who is there among us that reckons how many Sabbaths he hath profaned, how many vain Oaths he hath uttered, how many Lies he hath told, how often he hath wrong'd his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by Deceit, Fraud, Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, how often he hath abus'd the good Creatures of God through Riot, Exceſs and Intemperance? How many ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our ſins are that we have committed, they are all forgotten; what is paſt, it is to us as if it were never done.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo with ſuch as truly fear God; they make account of the leaſt ſin, and call to mind day by day the many errours of their lives. Holy men of God never have their ſins out of their ſight: <hi>David</hi> had them ever in his eye, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. <hi>My ſin is ever before me;</hi> it was never out of his thoughts, but continually before him, <pb n="563" facs="tcp:47453:289"/>as matter of ſorrow and grief to him. A true penitent cannot eaſily forget his ſins, but thinks of them often, and is daily and hourly troubled for them; but the careleſs ſinner never makes any reckoning of his ſins as ſoon as they are paſt, and the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the pleaſure is once over. He numbers his ſins indeed, but it is by Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Multiplication, not by Subſtraction; he continually adds to the old ſcore, but never takes ought from it; or if he do number them at any time, he makes but Cyphers of them, he ſlights and makes light of them, and thinks they ſtand for meer blanks. Let us make more reckoning of our ſins, and take a ſtrict account of them, and compute the ſins of our youth, the ſins of our grown years, the ſins of our old age; let us labour to know the full number of tale of them; otherwiſe, if we do not take account of our ſins, and daily number them, and ſum them up as many as we can remember, God will number them for us, and one day bring them to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance whether we will or no. God will return the like anſwer from heaven to us, as he did to <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> the King, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Mene, God hath numbred thy Kingdome, and finiſhed it: Mene, God hath numbred thy dayes, and finiſhed them.</hi> Better it is for us to number our own dayes, than leave them to God to number, and take ſuch an exact account of them, as to inflict the ſeverity of his wrath upon us for them: It is better for us to trouble our thoughts a little with the remembrance of ſin, than to be tormented hereafter with the puniſhment of ſin. Think then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of numbring thy ſins, that thou maiſt prevent God numbring of them to thy endleſs ſhame and grief.</p>

               <p>The ſecond Requeſt which <hi>Moſes</hi> makes to God, is this, That he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to teach him this one leſſon, to number his dayes: An hard leſſon indeed, as hard as <hi>Pambo</hi>'s was,
<note place="margin">Socr. Hiſt.

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 5.</note> It is a piece of Art, which none can teach us but God. A man may know how to number his dayes, but not how to guide his dayes: A Fool knows not how to make uſe of a Clock, nor an ignorant Chriſtian how to ſpend his time aright, unleſs God teach him. Every man can tell how to count an Army, and reckon what men there are in it, but few know how to guide it, and to rank the Souldery in right File and Order: So it is eaſie for us to number our dayes, to count how old we are, how many years are gone over our heads, but to order our dayes aright, to know how to improve them to Gods glory, and our own benefit, this is beyond our Art and Skill, and God only is able to inſtruct us, and lead us in the right way, wherein we ought to walk.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is from God that we are taught how to fit our ſelves for death. We are unwilling to hear of the approach of Death, and it is God that prepares us for the ſtroke of Death, and makes us willing to die.</p>
               <p>It is very unwelcome news to moſt of us, to hear that we muſt die, and be brought before God to give an account of our wayes and actions. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned with <hi>Felix</hi> of Death and Judgment, he would fain have put off that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing diſcourſe till ſome other time, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. <hi>Go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient ſeaſon I will call for thee.</hi> We count no diſcourſe ſo unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſtaſtful to us, as for our Miniſter to put us in mind of Death; there is time enough, we think, to conſider of our latter end many years hence. It is a leſſon ſoon learnt, and when we are fit for nothing elſe, then it is ſoon enough to think of Death.</p>
               <p>As ſlight as others make of this duty,

                  </note> let us pray to God to teach us the right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our time, that we may order our ſteps aright, and ſo lead our lives, as that we may provide for death, and be ready to give up our account to <hi>God,</hi> when he is pleaſed to ſummon us from hence. It was a good prayer of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 13.3. <hi>Lighten mine eyes, leſt I ſleep the ſleep of Death.</hi> We have need of Gods direction and guidance in all our wayes, that he would teach us how to live, and how to die: while we live let us deſire of God ſo to ſteer our courſe, as that we may lead the lives of holy and devout Chriſtians. We deſire to live, and have we no deſire to live well? what's this life without godlineſs? what is it to live, and to have our hearts all the dayes of our lives void of grace and piety? Life without grace, is like beauty in a woman without diſcretion, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Non eſt vivere, ſed valere vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:</hi> It is no life, but a living death alwayes to live, and to want health and ſtrength, which ſweetens life, and makes it comfortable. So it is no life a Chriſtian leads, where there is a want of piety in the heart. What is this to live, unleſs we know how to live well, and to make a right uſe of our time? We muſt conſider wherefore <pb n="565" facs="tcp:47453:290"/>we live, even to improve our time to the beſt advantage for the ſaving of our Souls; otherwiſe, we live like Beaſts, not like Men, not like Chriſtians: Theſe ſilly brutes live in time, but know not the time in which they live: ſo careleſs Chriſtians run out their time, but know not how to make uſe of their time; they conſume their time, but they do not increaſe it: Like Bankrupts that waſte their ſtock, but never ſeek to improve it. We make a decoction of our time, as water is boil'd away from a fourth part to a third, and from a third to half: ſo we waſte and conſume our time, till we have no time left, even till we come to the laſt minute of life: why then while we have time, let us pray to God to teach us to uſe it aright, to give us grace to conſider the time we ſpend, that we may make the beſt improvment of it, and as <hi>Eſan</hi> did <hi>Jacob,</hi> hold time by the heel, and not ſuffer it to ſlip from us, without giving a good account to God, that we have imployed that time and ſpace of life, which is allotted us here for the advancement of <hi>Gods</hi> glory and the purchaſing of our own Salvation.</p>
               <p>We proceed to the third particular,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 6.</note> that we go to God by prayer to teach us the right uſe of our time in a right manner, <hi>So teach us;</hi> that is, Teach us ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, ſo powerfully, ſo conſtantly, as that we may attain to the true wiſdome and knowledg of ſaving of our Souls. We muſt pray to God to teach us effectually <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.33. <hi>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy ſtatutes, and I ſhall keep it unto the end.</hi> We can know nothing of heaven, unleſs the Spirit of God inſtruct us. There is a great Light in us, the Light of Nature, and this light is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us, if we walk not according to this Light, this Light of Knowledg imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God in our hearts; and by this Light all Heathens are condemn'd: but this Light is not able to carry us half way to heaven. The Light of Nature cannot ſave us,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſth.</hi> 5.2.</note> but the light of Grace muſt bring us to the light of Glory. <hi>Eſther</hi> was fain to ſtand a loof off in the Court, till the King reach'd forth his Golden Scepter to invite her nearer to him: Nature only leads us to the outward Court of Heaven, but Grace holds forth the Scepter to bring us into Heaven: Nature, like the faint heat of the Sun, draws up the vapours but a little way, it hath not ſtrength enough to maſter our Corruptions; but the heat and power of Gods grace is only able to diſpel and vanquiſh them. It is only the work of Gods Spirit to ſhew us the right way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to guide us in that way. All lies in the Grace of God, and unleſs we are continually aſſiſted, and carryed on by his gracious Spirit, we are never likely to come near the ſight of Heaven. We have indeed many helps and furtherances to carry us to heaven, but none of theſe will avail us without God. The word of God is conſtantly preach'd in our ears, the Miniſters of God are daily preſſing us forward to heaven; but what can the frail voice of man work upon the heart without the powerful influence of Gods holy Spirit. We Miniſters, without God, are but as <hi>Gehazi</hi>'s ſtaff laid upon the dead Child;
<note place="margin">2 King. 4.31.</note> we are no wayes able to raiſe the Soul from the death of ſin to the life of righteouſneſs, unleſs God firſt breath upon it, and infuſe the life of Grace into the dead heart of the ſinner.</p>
               <p>Let this teach us not to reſt in our ſelves,

What's all the Light of Reaſon but darkneſs it ſelf, to bring us to the Light Everlaſting? All humane wiſdome is but a falſe Light, which will lead us in the end to the pit of deſtruction. It is a good caution the Apoſtle gives us, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware leſt any man ſpoil you through Philoſophy and vain deceit.</hi> If we follow the falſe Light of Reaſon, it will deceive us and miſguide us in our way to Heaven.

The horns of this Altar ſhall never ſave any man that flies unto them. As the light is hid under a buſhel, ſo nature is clouded and darkned with many miſts of errour, and cannot reach the ſight of heaven.</p>

Before we hear the Word of God, let us fall upon our knees, and beg of God to make it profitable and uſeful to our Souls. What makes the word of God ſo ineffectual? how come we to gain ſo little comfort <pb n="566" facs="tcp:47453:291"/>by the preaching of the Word? Is it not becauſe we do not pray to God to open our hearts, and make it uſeful to us, that we may attend to the word of Truth, and obtain Salvation by it? The people, before the Law was publiſhed to them, were cleanſed and ſanctified by <hi>Moſes</hi> to receive it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.14. So ought we to Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our hearts by prayer, and deſire of God to purge our Souls of the many polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our ſins, that we may gain a bleſſing by the Word of God, and return with joy and comfort from the houſe of God.</p>
               <p>It is prayer that makes the word of God profitable to our Souls;
<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.21.</note> it is like the Salt which <hi>Eliſha</hi> threw into the waters to heal them: So does prayer make the word of God beneficial to us, and cauſeth us to reliſh the ſweetneſs and comfort of it.</p>
               <p>The heart is like that Book ſealed with ſeven Seals,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5.3.</note> which no man can open but God himſelf: Therefore let us pray to God to open our hearts, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive inſtruction from the Word of God. There is no man can teach us effectually but God alone; no man can ſhew us the right way to heaven but God. Therefore let us pray, <hi>So teach us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We now come to the end, wherefore <hi>Moſes</hi> begs of God to teach us to number our dayes; <hi>That we may apply,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<note place="margin">

True wiſdome conſiſts not in gathering riches, but in living in the fear of God, and ordering our ſteps ſo, as that we may make ſure of heaven another day. It is our obedience to Gods Commandments, which cries us up for wiſe Chriſtians in the repute of God and man, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wiſdome and your underſtanding in the ſight of the Nations, which ſhall hear all theſe ſtatutes, and ſay, Surely this great Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a wiſe and underſtanding people.</hi> What is it for a man to be wiſe for the world and a fool for heaven? what's the wealth and honour of the world, to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Soul? what's a man the better for being rich and honourable in this world, if in the end his Soul be loſt? <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. <hi>What is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul?</hi> What the people ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.3. <hi>Thou art worth ten thouſand of us;</hi> the like I ſay of the Soul, It is more worth than a thouſand worlds; and the Salvation of thy Soul is more to thee than the gaining of many worlds.

               <p>Give me leave to ſpeak the truth, and not alwayes to drop oyl into your ears, and ſpeak unto you ſmooth things: Where ſhall we find the man that deſires to ſave his ſoul, that would willingly part with this world to gain a better? We daily hear the word of God, we talk much of Religion, we boaſt of our intereſt in heaven; but when the matter comes to deciſion, when we are put to our choice, whether Heaven or Earth,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.11.</note> whether we will forego the profits of this world for the love of heaven, this is the fiery Chariot which divides between <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> which parts us and God, and makes us to caſt away our hope of heaven for the love of earth.</p>
               <p>Let us labour for this main piece of wiſdome,

This is the only wiſdome which will ſtand us in ſtead, when we grow wiſe for a better life. And that we may provide for the life to come, let us learn this point of wiſdome, even to remember our latter end, &amp; know how to die well; <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29. <hi>Oh that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their latter end.</hi> This is the wiſdome of a Chriſtian, to prepare himſelf for death, to be ever in a readineſs to die, that when his change ſhall come, he may have this to comfort him, that whatſoever becomes of his body for the preſent, he hath made good proviſion for his Soul. He is the only wiſe Chriſtian that provides for Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and minds this only above all other things, how he may enjoy his God, and live with him for evermore. The Greeks have but one word to expreſs a wiſe man and an happy man, <gap reason="foreign">

Herein is the wiſdome of a Chriſtian, in labouring to attain true Bleſſedneſs, even the ſight and enjoyment of God for evermore. Oh bleſſed is the man that is ſo wiſe as to provide for Eternity, <pb n="568" facs="tcp:47453:292"/>who dies with this comfort, that though his body moulder into duſt and aſhes for a time, yet his Soul ſhall reſt in the arms of his Redeemer.</p>
               <p>The ſecond particular now follows, and that is the ſubject of this wiſdome, where it is ſeated, even in the heart and affection.</p>
               <p>This in brief is our next Concluſion,

The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> was ſo in love with the wiſdome of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as that ſhe took a tedious journey to give that wiſe King a viſit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.42. <hi>And behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</hi> What is <hi>Solomon</hi> to Chriſt? what is the wiſdome of man to the wiſdome of God? It is but as a Cloud to the brightneſs of the Sun, as the ſhadow to the ſubſtance; and he that loves the wiſdome of the World, and forſakes the wiſdome of God, embraceth a ſhadow, and forgoes the ſubſtance. What can we love, if our hearts be not enamoured with wiſdome? There is nothing amiable but wiſdome, and if we deſpiſe ber, what is there of this worlds good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we many ſet our love and affection? The learned men of old would only be called Philoſophers, Lovers of Wiſdome, not wiſe men, as if this were the higheſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of wiſdome, and no man was ſo wiſe, as he whoſe heart was enflam'd with the love of wiſdome. It is not enough to know that which is good, but we muſt be in love with that good which we do know.</p>
               <p>Let us be in love with true wiſdome,

Let us not content our ſelves with a bare ſight of heaven, with an outward view and ſpeculation of the glory of heaven, but let us faſten our deepeſt thoughts and meditations upon it. Let us not ſpeak of heaven, but let our hearts be raviſhed with the love of heaven. Our tongues are but the Suburbs of wiſdome, but the heart is the City. Let not wiſdome remain without the gate, in the mouth and outward profeſſion of piety; but let her be received into the City, and entertain'd with joy and gladneſs into the heart, and there reſt and repoſe her ſelf as in the boſome of her beſt beloved.</p>

                  </gap>, even a careful and ſerious thought of death. The memory of a Chriſtian is never better employed, then when the thought of death is preſented before it. This is our wiſdome to conſider and ſtudy how to die well. He is a wiſe man, whoſe memory ſerves him to think of death. The ſoundneſs of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack is the ſtrengthening of all the reſt of the parts of the body, ſo the vigour and ſtrength of the memory in thought of death, is the chief ſupport of the ſoul, and if the remembrance of death decay not in us, there is no want of wiſdome in the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Is it the meditation of death that makes us wiſe?

                  </note> Judge ye then how many fools there are in the world, that never entertain the leaſt thought of death into their hearts, that live and run on in ſin, and never think of the hour of death. It is the folly which the Prophet chargeth <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with, that ſhe did not conſider her lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end; <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.8. <hi>She remembreth not her laſt end, therefore ſhe came down won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully.</hi> In the height of her pride ſhe never thought of death. It is ſtrange to ſee, that we ſhould neither think of our own departure, nor heed the death of others, who are conſtant Monitors, and Remembrancers to us of our own frailty. If the Sun chance to be eclips'd, we ſtand amazed at the ſight of that darkneſs, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſpreads the face of that glorious body; but we never regard the declining and eclipſe of man, who is the more noble and glorious creature. If the Sun be darkned we wonder at it; if man die, we never heed it. Why then let me ſtir up your thoughts to the meditation of death, that ye may be ſo wiſe; as to have ever in mind the approach of death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us think of others, that are daily going to their long homes. Do we not ſee ſome continually coming into the world, and others making as much ſpeed out of the world, ſome entring upon the ſtage, others going off: As it is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant revolution of the heavens, ſome Stars riſe, and others ſet and fall: ſo it is with the Sons of men, ſome live, others die, ſome daily come forth out of their Mothers wombs, others daily return to the womb of their common mother, even the earth, from whence they were taken.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us look upon our ſelves, and conſider how neer death is approaching to us, and what haſt it makes towards us. We know not how ſoon death may ſurpriſe us, therefore let us be ſo wiſe, as to provide for his coming. Death for all that we know is now digging of our graves; even now he thinks of us, when we little think of him; let us then be as watchful for death, as he is for us; let us think of ſickneſs in the time of health, and in the day of proſperity remember the hour of death. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the midſt and height of all the glory and happineſs of this world, let us bring into our remembrance the time of our change and diſſolution. It is obſerveable, that at the very time of Chriſts glorions transfiguration, the conference which paſt between Chriſt and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> was concerning the death of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.31. They ſpeak of his deceaſe, which he ſhould accompliſh at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> to ſhew unto us, that when we are in the height of our glory and honour, our thoughts ſhould be buſied with the remembrance of our death and departure out of this world. I do not like the proverb which is too frequent in your mouths, <hi>I thought of ſuch a thing, no more then of my dying day.</hi> Let us remember the old Canon in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſenſe, <hi>Finis primus ſit in intentione;</hi> Let our end be firſt in our thoughts and intention; let the time of our death be the firſt thing we think of either morning or evening, that ſo the conſtant thought of death may take away the terrour of <pb n="570" facs="tcp:47453:293"/>death, and being ſo well acquainted with death before hand, we may never he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with the approach of it, but being guarded with faith and a good Conſcience, we may boldly look death in the face, and triumph in the conqueſt of the Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our through Chriſt our Saviour, by whom we obtain victory over death, and the fruit and benefit of our conqueſt, even the Salvation of our ſouls in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

There are ſome ſtains in the beſt Coats, there are ſpots in the beſt Ermine. It is nothing to be born a Gentleman, it is all in all to live and die a good Chriſtian. This was the ſweet expreſſion of this your honourable Neighbour, feeling a want of Grace in his heart, wherewith he deſired to be ſatiſfied, <hi>Oh,</hi> ſays he to me, <hi>one drop of grace in the heart, is more worth than all the wealth and honour in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not commend to you the goodneſs of his Nature, the ſweetneſs of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, becauſe he bewailed it as a Snare, and an occaſion of ſin to him. A mans good Nature leads him many times into ſin, and the loving temper of his ſpirit temps him, and puts him forward to ſin. Where Grace does not command, there a good diſpoſition is ſoon marr'd and drawn aſide. This likewiſe was matter of grief to him, that his frail Nature was ſoon wrought upon, and carried aſide to that which his own heart ſoon after told him was ſinful and diſpleaſing to God.</p>
               <p>What need I tell you, that he was an affable, friendly, and obliging Gentleman, winning and gaining upon all that came near him. He that look'd but upon his Face, might have ſeen goodneſs and courteſie looking out of his Eyes. And what's all this, when he did acknowledge with tears, that this pleaſantneſs of his countenance was ſuddenly clouded with a violent and over-ruling ſtorm of paſſion, which carried him beyond himſelf. But it is ſtrange to ſee what a command grace hath over the Soul, which ſpeaks to theſe unruly paſſions, as Chriſt did to the boiſterous billows of the Sea, <hi>Peace, be ſtill,</hi> Mar. 4.39. as eaſily as the Nurſe charms the crying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in the Cradle. As prevalent as theſe paſſions were in the time of his health, they were ſo allayed by God in his ſickneſs, as that all his friends about him did rejoyce to ſee the patience and calmneſs of his Spirit, all the while the hand of God was upon him.</p>
               <p>And that I may give you a clear proof of the mortified Spirit and happy change, <pb n="571" facs="tcp:47453:293"/>which God wrought in his Soul. When I took the boldneſs to mind him of a late difference between himſelf and the Reverend Paſtor of this place, he burſt out with tears, and laid this charge upon me, That I would right him ſo far, as to acquaint him, that he did heartily deſire him in particular to forgive him, and all other good Chriſtians that he had wrong'd in the heat of his paſſion, either rich or poor.</p>
               <p>Judge ye now, what could I have ſpoken more for his honour, than I have done in this diſcovery of his frailty, and his happy conqueſt of it. Therefore I thought good to make this publication of it to the world, that ye may know ye never ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you ſelves more, than when ye glorifie God by ſhaming of your ſelves: when we are moſt vile in our own eyes, we are moſt honourable in the repute of God and good men.</p>
               <p>But all this that I have ſpoken, is nothing to that which is yet behind. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go along with me a little further, and I ſhall in brief relate unto you ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable paſſages as fell from him in the time of his ſickneſs, and then leave him to your Chriſtian Charity to judge, how well he acted the latter part of his life, and with what earneſtneſs of ſpirit he ſtrove to gain the love and favour of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>At my firſt coming to him I found him deeply toucht with a ſerious apprehenſion of the former errours of his life, how far he had provoked a good God by the many ſins, which his Conſcience then charged him with: Then d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

I was glad to ſee thoſe Limbecks of his eyes diſtilling, and dropping down in ſuch a plentiful manner, to find his heart thus ſmitten, and bruiſ ed with the remembrance of his ſins, and preſt him to a greater meaſure of ſorrow as knowing ſuch clouds of grief would make way for the beams of joy and comfort to ſhine in his Soul. The truth is, I have not come near a man that hath reckoned up his fins wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

I askt him, whether if God ſhould be pleaſed to grant him a further reſpite in this world, he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new man, and take off his heart from his former vanities. He anſwered. <hi>I would not for the gain of the whole world live ſuch a life as I have done, and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire next to Gods glory to live for this very end, that I might teſtifi<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the truth of my repentance to the world.</hi> I askt him, whether his heart did witneſs the truth of all this. <hi>Oh,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>my heart is deceitful and treacherous, but if I know my own heart, all that I ſpeak is in truth and ſincerity; I ſhould be the moſt curſed Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite alive, if I ſhould either diſſemble with God or man at ſuch a time as this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh remember to deal faithfully with your own hearts, if you ſpeak otherwiſe than ye find it to be in your own breaſts, you turn Impoſters to your ſelves, and deludes your own Souls, not us. It is the integrity of the heart which God looks at; if there be no rottenneſs there, there is a good foundation of joy and comfort laid in the Soul: 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Beloved; if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now from the example of this good Knight, let me preſs this one thing upon you, That when ye find your hearts oppreſt with the weight of your ſins, ye would give them a ſpeedy vent, and ſeek to eaſe your hearts of ſo mighty a clog, by a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confeſſion of them. He that ſmothers ſin in his breaſt, will in the end be choaked with the noiſome ſcent of it. What is a man the better for hiding and locking up his ſin in his boſome? Let me adviſe you to open a vein in your own hearts, and let out the corrupt blood that lies there: The longer we hide ſin in our boſoms, the more it feſters, and what man will not do his beſt to get rid of a bruiſe, before it rots and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſies? Confeſſion is a ſoveraign Remedy to procure the pardon of our ſins; <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>Who ſo confeſſeth and for ſaketh his ſins ſhall have mercy.</hi> He is moſt likely to find mercy, that is moſt ready to acknowledge that he deſerves none.</p>
               <p>We ſee what <hi>David</hi> gain'd by an humble confeſſion of his ſins: He no ſooner cried <hi>Peccavi,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.13. <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord;</hi> then the Prophet return'd him a comfortable anſwer from the Lord, <hi>The Lord alſo hath put away <pb n="572" facs="tcp:47453:294"/>thy ſin, thou ſhalt not die.

               <p>And here I hope I ſhall ſeaſonably caſt in a word of advice to my Brethren of the Clergy, that dejected ſinners may with ſafety lodge their grievances in their breaſts; let me deſire them,
<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

This makes ſo many Chriſtians to carry their ſin with them to their graves, rather than they will diſcloſe it, becauſe they dare not repoſe any truſt in thoſe that ought to be as true to them as there own hearts.
<note place="margin">Hippocrates in Juramento Strigel, in in Phil. 1.16.</note> If we find a man truly penitent for his ſins, let us cover them with the vail of Charity, and onely declare his repentance to the world, that God may be glorified, and good Chriſtians on Earth, as the Angels in Heaven, rejoyce in the converſion of a ſinner.</p>
               <p>I have much to ſpeak, but am willing to contract my ſelf, as knowing you are fully ſatisfied in that faithful Teſtimony I have already given you. Be not ſo unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as to think I might be miſtaken in this good Gentleman; I was often with him, and had frequent converſe with him, and the freedom to ſpeak, and I found him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the ſame humble frame and temper of ſpirit; and I muſt profeſs this, I have not often received more ſatisfaction from any man in reſpect of the fruit and comfort of my endeavours, than from him. I met with an humble and tractable ſpirit, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear of the wrath of God due to ſinners; and careful and ſolicitous how he might avoid it; truly ſenſible of the weight of his ſins, much dejected with the thought of them; and ſo far the ſenſe of his ſins had humbled him, as that I may ſay, Malice it ſelf could not judge worſe of him, than he did of himſelf. And that which made me believe the truth of his humiliation for ſin, was this, That I found no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptious thoughts ariſing in his heart of Gods mercy: but when I ſought to cheer him with the hope of Gods mercy to penitent ſinners, he told me, <hi>He was not yet hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled enough to partake of it.</hi> I was much ſatisfied in this anſwer, as knowing the deeper the foundation is laid, the ſurer is the building; the more humble we are, the firmer will our confidence be in Chriſt. And from that time I ſtrove to comfort him with the precious Promiſes of the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> tl. 28.</note> and told him he might upon the word of Chriſt challenge an intereſt in them, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Such as are truly penitent, and onely ſuch, might claim a ſpecial Title to the Promiſes of Chriſt. This did revive his fainting ſpirit, and the thought of Gods mercy in Chriſt did as much cheer him, as ever the ſenſe of ſin had dejected him. Then he began to feel the comfort of Gods love glowing in his breaſt; ſoon after he felt the heat of it, and his affections were ſo enflamed with the love of God, as that his thoughts were reſtleſs, till he enjoyed him whom his Soul loved; and this made him to count every minute too long to be parted from Chriſt his Saviour. Therefore being now fit for heaven, and weary of the world, and deſirous to enjoy God in a better place, the laſt words I heard him utter were theſe, <hi>Even ſo, come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> Chriſt cannot come too ſoon for that heart that is ready to receive him. The Lord makes us fit for his coming, and we ſhall be happy whenſoever he comes.</p>
               <p>And now after all this that I have ſpoken, you will ſay, I have ſaid nothing for the honour of this good Knight, I have not buried him like himſelf; I have ſtrew'd no flowers of Commendation upon his Herſe, befitting his quality and Degree, and the Houſe he came from. I confeſs all this. As he deſired all vain pomp and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhould be laid aſide at his funerals; (<hi>For what have I done,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that I ſhould deſerve it?</hi>) ſo have I declined all pomp and vanity of words in the Pulpit, which is no place to ſhew our quaint and lofty ſtrains of Oratory, but our zeal to Gods glory, and the edification of his people. I came not ſo far to ſawn and flatter, but to teſtifie my pious reſpects to the memory of the Dead, and my unfeigned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Souls of the Living.</p>
               <p>But what? Is not this, that he dyed a good Chriſtian; that he loathed his former Vanities; that he was truly humbled for his ſins, and reſted upon the Mercy of God <pb n="573" facs="tcp:47453:294"/>in Chriſt for the free pardon of them? If you value not theſe things, pardon me, if I think there is nothing to be valued in you but vanity; and what the value of that will be, you will know at the hour of Death. God grant you may know it ſooner and then you are happy, when you will find that piety in the heart is more to be accounted of, then all the wealth and honour in the world.</p>
               <p>I think I have ſaid enough to honour this Noble Knight at his Funerals, that he dyed a true Child of God, and left a goodly Inheritnance on Earth, to be poſſeſſed of a better in Heaven. There have I a good ground to believe he reſts in peace and joy, and there I hope we ſhall all meet at the laſt.</p>
               <p>And thus in an holy intention to Gods glory, a zealous deſire of your good, and an honourable reſpect to my Friend, I have now run through the duty of this day, not aiming (God knows my heart) at the leaſt applauſe from you, nor yet valuing the cenſure of malevolent ſpirits, who ſhake off all Charity to the Dead, and to the Living. I have endeavoured to approve my ſelf faithful to God, in ſpeaking nothing but the Truth; faithful to my ſelf, in the diſcharge of a good Conſcience; and faithful to my Friend, in publiſhing the truth of his Converſion, to the world. Thus have I ſought to honour God, to right your worthy Neighbour, and in ſo doing I hope I have not wronged my ſelf.</p>
               <p>And now it is my earneſt prayer to God for you, (not that I may injure the Dead, but in love to your Souls) that all of you may have the grace to live better than he did; And this I wiſh again from my heart, hoping the beſt of him, and fearing the worſt of ſome of you, that ye may obtain the like Faith and Repentance to die no worſe than he did. His Soul now reſts in Bliſs and joy; do ye that ſurvive, labour to <hi>enter into that reſt which remains for the people of God,</hi>

               <p>Firſt, that it is ſo; believe <hi>Solomons</hi> eyes, who profeſſed that he <hi>ſaw it.</hi> But here it will be demanded, how came he to behold a <hi>righteous man?</hi> with what rare and new <hi>eye-ſalve</hi> had he anointed his eyes, to ſee that which his father <hi>David</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a more holy,

               </p>
               <p>It is anſwered,
<note place="margin">4.</note> though ſuch an one whoſe righteouſneſs is Gods juſtice-proof, never was, is, nor ſhall be in this life, (Chriſt alone excepted, being God and man) yet in a Goſpel, or qualified ſenſe, he is accounted righteous, who <hi>juxt a propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum juſte vivendi,</hi> is ſo <hi>intentionally;</hi> deſiring and endeavouring after righteouſneſs with all the might of his Sonl. Secondly, who is ſo <hi>comparatively,</hi> in reference to wicked men, appearing righteous in regard of thoſe, who have no goodneſs at all in their hearts. Thirdly, righteous <hi>imputatively,</hi> having the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt imputed unto him. Laſtly, righteous <hi>inheſively,</hi> having many heavenly graces, and holy endowments, ſincere, though not perfect, or evangelically perfect, <hi>pro hoc ſtatu,</hi> beſtowed upon, and remaining within him.

               </p>
               <p>But in the ſecond place, it will be inquired, How could <hi>Solomon</hi> patiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>a righteous man periſh in his righteouſneſs,</hi> and not reſcue him out of the paws of oppreſſion? Could he ſee it, and could he ſuffer it, and be only an idle ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at ſo ſad a tragedy? Did his hand ſway the Scepter, and was his head inveſted with the Crown,

Could he only as in the <hi>caſe of the harlots,</hi> call for a ſword to kill a child, and not call for it to defend a <hi>righteous man? He that is not with us</hi> (faith our Saviour) <hi>is againſt us.</hi> If it hold in private perſons, much more in publick Officers. They perſecute, who do not protect; deſtroy, who do not defend; ſlay, who do not ſave <hi>the righteous man,</hi> who have power and place to do it.</p>
               <p>It is anſwered in the firſt place;
<note place="margin">6.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomons</hi> obſervations were not all confined to his own country and kingdome; though ſtaying at home in his perſon, his mind travelled into forraign parts, &amp; in the neighbouring countries of <hi>Egypt, Edom, Syria, Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c. might behold the <hi>periſning of the righteous,</hi> and long flouriſhing of the wicked. Secondly his expreſſion, <hi>I have ſeen,</hi> relates not only to his ocular, but experimental diſcoveries; What <hi>Solomon</hi> got hy the help of Hiſtory, Study, and peruſal of Chronicles. He that was skil'd in natural Philoſophy from the Cedar to the Shrub, was (no doubt) well verſed in all civil occurrences from the Prince to the Peaſant, from <hi>Adam</hi> to the preſent age wherein he lived, ſo much as by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant records could be collected. To ſet humane writers aſide, the Scripture alone afforded him plentiful preſidents herein. Open the Bible, and we ſhall find (almoſt in the firſt leaf) <hi>juſt</hi> Abel <hi>periſhing in his righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> Cain <hi>prolonging his life in his iniquity.</hi> To omit other inſtances, <hi>Solomon,</hi> by relation from his father, might ſadly remember, how <hi>Abimelech</hi> the High Prieſt, <hi>periſhed in his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> with all the Prieſts, inhabitants of the city of <hi>Nob,</hi> whileſt <hi>Saul</hi> who condemned, and <hi>Doeg</hi> who executed them, flouriſhed long in their iniquity. So much for the proof, <hi>that it is ſo.</hi> Come we now to the reaſons, <hi>why it is ſo.</hi> Theſe reaſons are of a double nature, ſome fetcht from nature, others from religion. For the preſent we inſiſt only upon the former, reſerving the reſt till we ſhall encounter the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in the ſequel of our diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">7.</note> Becauſe good men, of all others, are moſt envied and maligned, having <pb n="577" facs="tcp:47453:296"/>the fierceſt adverſaries to oppoſe them. With the moſt in the world, it is quarrel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hate a good man, becauſe he is a good man. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> faith of himſelf, <hi>I preſs towards the mark.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.14.</note> And the ſame is the endeavour of every good man. Now as in a race the formoſt man who is neareſt the mark, is envied of all thoſe which come after him, who commonly uſe all foul play towards him, (juſtling him on the ſide, ſeeking to trip up his heels; yea, ſometimes thruſting him forward on the back, that ſo he might fall headlong by his own weight and their violence) ſo often cometh it to paſs betwixt rivals in the race of honour and vertue. Ill-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men perceiving themſelves quite out ſtrips by ſome eminent perſon who hath got the ſpeed of them, and deſpairing fairly to overtake him, reſolve fouly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn him, by all means poſſible contriving his deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Hence come thoſe many millions of divices and ſtratagems contrived for his ruin, endeavouring either to,

                     <item>Divert him from his righteouſneſs. or</item>
                     <item>Deſtroy him in his righteouſneſs.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>If the firſt takes no effect, and if his conſtancy appears ſuch as <hi>without regret</hi> he will perſiſt in piety, leaving them no hope to <hi>byaſs</hi> him to baſe ends, then diſpairing to <hi>how him from,</hi> they contrive to <hi>break him in his righteouſneſs.</hi> Thus whilſt he hath many enemies which conſpire his deſtruction, ſeeking with power to ſuppreſs, or pollicy to ſupplant him; The wicked man on the other ſide, hath the generality of men (the moſt being bad as himſelf) to befriend him; a main cauſe of his prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſucceſsful in his wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">9.</note> 
                  <hi>Righteous men periſh in their righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe not ſo wary, and watchful to defend themſelves in danger, being deaf to all jealouſies and ſnſpitions, over-confident of other men, meaſuring all others by the integrity of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. This makes them lie at an open guard, not fencing and fortifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt any ſudden ſurpriſal, but preſuming, that deſerving no hurt, none ſhall be done unto them. Thus <hi>Gedaliah,</hi> Governour of the remnant of the <hi>Jews</hi> after the captivity, twice received the expreſs intelligence of a conſpiracy to kill him, yet was ſo far from giving credit, that he gave a ſharp reproof to the firſt diſcoverer thereof:
<note place="margin">Act. 18.16.</note> Yea, when <hi>Johanan</hi> the ſon of <hi>Kareah,</hi> tendered his ſervice to kill <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> (ſent as he ſaid, from <hi>Baalis</hi> King of <hi>Ammon</hi> to ſlay <hi>Gedaliah</hi>) <hi>Gedaliah</hi> rejoyned, <hi>Thou ſhalt not do this thing, for thou ſpeakeſt falſely of Iſhmael.</hi> His noble nature gave no entertainment to the report, till he found it too late to prevent it. Whilſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, partly out of policy, more out of guiltineſs, ſleep like <hi>Hercules</hi> with their club in their haud, ſtand alwayes on their guard, are jealous of their very ſhadows, and appearances of danger, a great cauſe of their ſafety and ſucceſs, prolonging themſelves in their wickedneſs.</p>

                  <hi>They periſh</hi> becauſe of a lazie principle which hath poſſeſſed the heads and hearts even of the beſt men, (who are unexcuſable herein) namely, that God in due time will defend their innocence, which makes them more negligent and remiſs in defending themſelves; as the Prophet makes mention of <hi>a ſtone cut out without hands,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 2.34.</note> they conceive their cauſe will without manshelp hew its own way through the rocks of all reſiſtance; as if their cauſe would ſtand Centinal for them, though they ſlept themſelves; as if their cauſe would (fix their Muskets) though they did it not themſelves. Thus the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in their battels againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> having <hi>won the day</hi> by their valour, have <hi>loſt the night</hi> by their negligence, which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally proceeded from their confidence, that God intereſted as a Second in every juſt cauſe, was in that quarrel concerned as a Principle, and it could not ſtand in his juſtice to ſuffer it to miſcarry.</p>
               <p>Whereas on the other ſide wicked men uſe double diligence in promoting their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.
<note place="margin">11.</note> If their lame cauſe lack legs of its own, they will give it wings from their ſigns. If their lame cauſe lack legs of its own, they will give it wings from their careful ſolliciting thereof, and will ſoulder up their crackt title with their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. They watch for all tides, and wait for all times, and work by all wayes, and ſail by all winds; each golden opportunity they cunningly court, and greedily catch: and carefully keep, &amp; thriſtily uſe: in a word, <hi>they are wiſer in their generations then the children of light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="578" facs="tcp:47453:297"/>This may be perceived by the parallel betwixt the wife and the harlot:
<note place="margin">12.</note> many wives (though herein they cannot be defended) knowing their husbands obliged in conſcience to love them by verture of their ſolemn promiſe made before God and the congregation at their marriage, are therefore the leſs careful to ſtudy compliance to their husbands deſires; they know their husbands, if wronging them, wrong themſelves therein; and preſuming themſelves to deſerve love as due unto them for their honeſty and loyalty of affections, are the leſs ſollicitous to gain that which they count their own already. Whileſt the harlot conſcious to her ſelf of her uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, that ſhe hath no lawful right to the imbraces of her paramour, tunes her ſelf to the criticalneſs of all complacency to humour him in all his deſires. And thus alwayes thoſe men whoſe cauſe have the weakeſt foundation in piety, getteth the ſtrongeſt buttreſs in policy to ſupport it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">13.</note> the <hi>righteous man,</hi> by the principles of his profeſſion, is tyed up, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined onely to the uſe of ſuch means for his preſervation, as are conſonant to Gods will, conformable to his word; preferring rather to die many times, then to ſave himſelf once by unwarrantable waies. Propounded unto him a project for his ſafety, and as <hi>Solomon</hi> promiſed favour to <hi>Adonijah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King, 52.</note> ſo long as he <hi>ſhewed himſelf worthy,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>if wickedneſs were found in him, he ſhould ſurely die;</hi> So our <hi>righteous man</hi> onely accepts and embraceth ſuch plots to ſecure himſelf thereby, as acquit themſelves honeſt and honourable: ſuch as appear otherwiſe, he preſently diſpatches with deteſtation, deſtroying the very motion and mention thereof, from entring into his hearts. On the other ſide, the wicked man is left at large, allowing himſelf li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and latitude, to do any thing in his own defence, making a conſtant practice of <hi>doing evil, that good may come thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea we may obſerve in all ages,
<note place="margin">14.</note> that wicked men make bold with Religion; and thoſe who count the practice of plety a burden, find the pretending thereof an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and therefore be the matter they manage never ſo bad (if poſſible) they will intitle it to be <hi>Gods cauſe.</hi> Much was the ſubſtance in the very ſhadow of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> which made the people ſo deſirous thereof as he paſſed by the ſtreets. And the very umbrage of Religion hath a ſovereign virtue in it. No better cordial for a dying cauſe, then to over-ſhadow it with the pretence that it is <hi>Gods cauſe;</hi> for firſt, this is the way to make and keep a good and ſtrong party: No ſooner the watch-word is given out, <hi>For Gods cauſe,</hi> but inſtantly GAD, <hi>Behold a troop cometh</hi> of many honeſt, but ignorant men, who preſs to be liſted in ſo pious an employment. Theſe may be kild, but cannot be conquered: for till their judgements be otherwiſe informed, they will triumph in being overcome, as confident, the deeper their wounds got in <hi>Gods cauſe</hi> gape in their bodies; the wider the gates of heaven ſtand open to receive their ſouls. Beſides, the pretending their cauſe is <hi>Gods cauſe,</hi> will in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, legitimate the bareſt means, in purſuance and proſecution thereof; for, though it be againſt Gods word, <hi>to do evil that good may come thereof,</hi> yet this old error will hardly be beaten out of the heads and hearts of many men, that crooked waies are made direct, by being directed to a ſtraight end; and the luſtre of a bright cauſe will reflect a ſeeming light on very <hi>deeds of darkneſs,</hi> uſed in tendency thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>This hath been an ancient ſtratagem of the worſt men (great Politicians) to take piety in their way,
<note place="margin">15.</note> to the advancing of their deſences. Thus <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> pretended a Commiſſion from God, for all the wickedneſs he committed, and complements blaſphemy,
<note place="margin">2 King. 18.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Am I now come up without the Lord, againſt this place to deſtroy it? the Lord ſaid to me, Go up againſt this place to deſtrey it.</hi> The Prieſts of <hi>Bell</hi> were but bunglers, which could not ſteal the meat of their Idol, but they muſt be diſcovered by the print of their foot-ſteps. Men are grown more cunning thieves now adaies; firſt they will put on the ſhooes of him they intend to rob, and then ſteal, that ſo their treadings may tell no tales to their diſadvantage; They will not ſtride a pace, nor go a ſtep, nor ſtir a foot, but all for <hi>Gods cauſe,</hi> all for the good and glory of God. Thus Chriſt himſelf was ſerved from his cradle to his croſs; <hi>Herod</hi> who ſought to kill him, pretended to worſhip him, and <hi>Judas</hi> kiſſed him who betrayed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="579" facs="tcp:47453:297"/>By theſe arts and divices,
<note place="margin">16.1 King. 26.15.2 King. 24.8.2 King. 2.19.1 King. 19.29.</note> it cometh to paſs, that wicked men prolong themſelves into heir wickedneſs. Traiterous <hi>Zimri</hi> indeed continued but ſeven daies, that was not long: wicked <hi>Jehojachin</hi> reigned but three months in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that was not long: ungodly <hi>Amon</hi> reigned two years in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that was not long: idolatrous <hi>Ahab</hi> reigned in <hi>Samaria</hi> twenty and two years, that was indifferent long: cruel <hi>Herod</hi> the King, who ſought to kill Chriſt, reigned in <hi>Judea</hi> well nigh forty years, that was long indeed; he prolonged himſelf to purpoſe in his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore (to recollect what hath been ſaid) the righteous hath moſt foes,
<note place="margin">17.</note> the wicked many friends; the righteous free from; the wicked full of jealouſies; the righteous too often over-careleſs, the wicked over-careful in his defence; the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous limited onely to lawful, the wicked left looſe to any means for his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; No wonder if it often cometh to paſs, that the <hi>righteous man periſheth in his righteouſneſs, and the wicked prolongeth his life in his wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now to the abuſes which wicked men make of the righteous mans periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his righteouſneſs.
<note place="margin">18.</note> And here the whole kennel of Atheiſts come in with a full cry, (oh that there were no more of them on earth, then there are in hell, where torture makes them all ſpeak truth) ſpending their wicked breath againſt God and his attributes. Some bark at his Provedence, as if he perceived not theſe things; <hi>How doth God know,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.11.</note> and is there knowledge in the moſt high?</hi> Others cavil at his juſtice, that he has no mind; others carp at his ſtrength, that he has no power to rectifie and redreſs theſe enormities. This world (ſay they) is a ſhip without a pilot, ſteered onely with the windes and wayes of caſualty; it is a meer <hi>lottery,</hi> wherein the beſt man dayly draw the <hi>blanks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.4.</note> and the worſt run away with the <hi>prizes.</hi> And, as <hi>Abſolom</hi> boaſted, if he were king of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how far he would out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do <hi>David</hi> in right managing of all matters: ſo theſe impudent wretches conceive with themſelves, the Plat form of the world hath been more perſect, might they have been admitted to the making thereof. The Moon would have ſhined without any ſpots, Roſes grow without any Prickles, fair weather ſhould never have done harm, becauſe rain ſhould only fall in the night, neither to hinder the pleaſure of the rich, or hurt the profit of the poor. Merit ſhould be made the onely ſtandard of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; no <hi>periſhing of the righteous man in his righteouſneſs,</hi> when ſucceſs ſhould onely be entailed on deſert. In a word, ſuch Atheiſts preſume all things by them ſhould be ſo prudently diſpoſed, that nothing, no doubt, in the whole world ſhould be out of order, ſave themſelves.</p>
               <p>More might be ſpoken to heighten and prove the objection, but I am afraid to perſiſt further therein. It is not onely dangerous to be, but even to act an Atheiſt, though with intent to confute their errour, for fear that our poiſons pierce further then our antidotes. But in anſwer to this objection; know, that God, without the leaſt prejudice to his juſtice, may ſuffer <hi>the righteous man to periſh in his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> becauſe allow him righteous <hi>juſticia cauſe,</hi> he is not ſo <hi>juſticia perſone,</hi> the beſt man ſtanding guilty of many faults and failings in his ſight. God needs not <hi>pick a quarrel</hi> with any man, having at all times matter of a juſt controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. And ſeeing God hath oftentimes connived at him being faulty, he may condemn him being faultleſs; for, <hi>mullum tempus occurrit Regi,</hi> the King of heaven is not limited to any time, but at his own pleaſure and leaſure may take an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to puniſh an offender.</p>
               <p>Secondly, grant that the cauſe of the <hi>righteous man</hi> was juſt in the primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution thereof, yet if it branch it ſelf forth into numerous circumſtances appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant thereunto, (many whereof may be intricate and perplext) if it be of ſo ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ponderous a nature, that it requires many heads and hands as ſubordinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in ſeveral places for the managing thereof. Laſtly, if the cauſe be ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix and tedious, that many years muſt be ſpent in the proſecution thereof, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal righteouſneſs of the cauſe may be already with the handling of it, and much injuſtice annexed thereunto, for which God may juſtly cauſe it finally to miſcarry. For it is poſſible that a cauſe conſiſting of ſuch variety of limbs retaining thereunto, ſhould be carried on without many grand errours and miſtakes committed therein; <pb n="580" facs="tcp:47453:298"/>and the righteouſneſs of the beſt men will not ſpread ſo broad without ſhrinking, ſtretch ſo long without tyring, apply it ſelf ſo exactly to each circumſtance without ſome ſwerving therein. Eſpecially when all the faults of the inferior officers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed under him, are chargeable on the <hi>righteous mans</hi> account, the matter of whoſe cauſe may juſtly periſh, by Gods juſt anger on the unjuſt managery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Yea God,
<note place="margin">21.</note> without the leaſt blemiſh to his Juſtice, may ſuffer the righteous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally to <hi>periſh in his righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe in the midſt of their ſufferings his mercy ſupports them with the inward comfort of a clear conſcience. In the time of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, a woman being big with child, was impriſoned and condemned to die, which the night before her execution, was (I cannot ſay brought to bed) delivered of a child, when her pain (wanting the help of a midwife) muſt be preſumed exceeding great; The Jailor hearing her cry out in her pangs: <hi>If you cry</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to day, I will make you ſhreek worſe to morrow, when you are to be burnt at a ſtake.</hi> The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man replied; <hi>Not ſo, to morrow my pain will be abated: for to day I ſuffer as an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, for the puniſhment juſtly impoſed by God on our ſex, for our diſobedience and breach of his law; but to morrow I ſhall die for the teſtimony of the truth, in the defence of Gods glory and his true Religion.</hi> Thus it is ſtrange to ſee, what alacrity a good cauſe inſuſeth into <hi>arighteous man,</hi> deriving comfort into his heart by inſenſible conveyances, ſo that he imbraceth even death in ſelf with a ſmiling countenance, ſeeding his ſoul on the continual feaſt of a clear conſcience.</p>
               <p>Beſides this,
<note place="margin">22.</note> it clears divine Juſtice, and comforts the righteous man <hi>periſhing temporally in his righteouſneſs,</hi> that his cauſe ſhall be heard over again, and rejudged in another world. If one conceive himſelf wronged in the <hi>Hundred,</hi> or any inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Court, he may by a <hi>cretiorari,</hi> or an <hi>accedas ad curiam,</hi> remove it to the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> or <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> as he is adviſed beſt for his own advantage. If he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth himſelf injured in theſe Courts, he may with a <hi>Writ of Errour</hi> remove it, to have it argued by all the Judges, in the <hi>Exchequer chamber.</hi> If here alſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth himſelf to find no juſtice, he may with an <hi>Injunction,</hi> out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> ſtop their proceedings. But if in the <hi>Chancery</hi> he reputeth himſelf agrieved, he may thence appeal to the <hi>God of heaven and earth,</hi> who in another world, will vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his right, and ſeverely puniſh ſuch as have wilfully offered wrong unto him. And ſo much to aſſert Gods juſtice in ſuffering the <hi>righteous man to periſh in his righteouſneſs.</hi>

               <p>Now on the other ſide,

                     </gap>1.</note> God may without any prejudice to his juſtice, ſuffer wicked men for a time to thrive in this world, and not ſuddenly ſurpriſe them with puniſhment, ſo giving them <hi>a ſpace to repent,</hi> if they would but make uſe thereof. Indeed <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Evil ſhall hunt the violent man to overthrow him;</hi> But God is a <hi>fair hunter;</hi> he might in the rigour of his juſtice knock wicked men down as he finds them <hi>ſitting in their forms:</hi> But God will give them <hi>fair law,</hi> they ſhall for a time run; yea ſport themſelves before his judgements, ere they are pleaſed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them.</p>
               <p>Know alſo,
<note place="margin">24.</note> to the farther clearing of his juſtice, that wicked men, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their thriving in badneſs for a time, are partly puniſhed in this world, with a conſtant corroſive of a guilty conſcience, which they carry about them.

<note place="margin">Mat. 8.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Maſter, I will follow thee whitherſoever thou goeſt;</hi> what is promiſed by him, is preformed by a guilty conſcience, that <hi>Squire of the body,</hi> alwayes officious to attend a malefactour.

<note place="margin">Dan. 5.5.

               <p>I have read of one,
<note place="margin">25.</note> who undertook in few dayes to make a fat ſheep lean; and yet was to allow him a daily and large proviſion of meat, ſoft and eaſie lodging, with ſecurity from all danger, that nothing ſhould hurt him. This he effected, by putting <pb n="581" facs="tcp:47453:298"/>him into an Iron-grate, and placing a ravenous wolf hard by in another, alwayes howling, fighting, ſcenting, ſcratching at the poor ſheep; which affrighted with this ſad ſound, and worſe ſight, had little joy to eat, leſs to ſleep; whereby his fleſh was ſuddenly abated. But wicked men have the terrors of an affrighted conſcience conſtantly, not onely barking at them, but biting of them; which diſſweetens their moſt delicious mirth, with the ſad conſideration of the ſins they have committed, and puniſhment they muſt undergo, when in another world they ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to account. This thought alone makes their ſouls lean, how fat ſoever their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may appear. And as ſores and wounds commonly ſmart, ake, and throb moſt, the nearer it is to night; ſo the anguiſh and torture of a guilty conſcience increaſeth, the neerer men apprehend themſelves to the day of their death.</p>
               <p>Now not onely wicked men,
<note place="margin">26.</note> but even the children of God, becauſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their hearts, too often make bad uſes to themſelves, <hi>of the righteous mans periſhing in his righteouſneſs.</hi> Theſe may be divided into three ranks:

               </p>
               <p>The firſt are the <hi>Fretters:</hi> for if the <hi>periſhing of the righteous</hi> cometh to the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervation of a high-ſpirited man, one of a ſtout and valiant heart, he will ſcarce brook it without ſome anger and indignation, fuming and chaſing thereat.

Wherefore let not our ignorance be counted Gods injuſtice, let not the dimneſs of our eyes be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the durtineſs of his actions, being all purity and cleanneſs in themſelves: Let us, if beaten from our out-works, make a ſafe retreat to this impregnable caſtle, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> his concluſion, <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the good Uſes that the godly ought to make of a <hi>righteous mans periſhing in his righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">31.</note> And firſt, when he finds ſuch a one in a ſwoun, he ought with all ſpeed to bring him a cordial, and with the good <hi>Samaritane,</hi> to pour Oil and Wine into his wounds,
<note place="margin">Luke 10.34.</note> endeavouring his recovery to his utmoſt power, whileſt there is any hope thereof.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 79.11.</note> I muſt confeſs it is only Gods prerogative, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatneſs of his power, to preſerve thoſe that are appointed to die.</hi> However, it is alſo the boundant duty of all pious people, in their ſeveral diſtances and degrees, to improve their utmoſt for the preſervation of dying innocency, from the cruelty of ſuch as would murder it.</p>
               <p>But if it be impoſſible to ſave it from death,
<note place="margin">32.</note> ſo that it doth expire, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their care to the contrary; they muſt then turn lamenters at the funerals thereof. And if the iniquity of the times will not ſafely afford them to be <hi>open,</hi> they muſt be <hi>cloſe Mourners</hi> at ſo ſorrowful an accident. O let the moſt cunning <hi>Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons</hi> not begrutch their skill to unbowel, the <hi>richeſt Merchants</hi> not think much of their choiſeſt ſpices to embalm, the moſt <hi>exquiſite Joyner</hi> make the coffin, moſt <hi>reverend Divine,</hi> the Funeral Sermon, the moſt <hi>accurate Marbler</hi> erect the <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and moſt renowned <hi>Poet</hi> invent the Epitaph, to be inſcribed on the tomb of <hi>Periſhing Righteouſneſs.</hi> Whileſt all others, well-wiſhers to goodneſs in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, contribute to their ſorrow at the ſolemn Obſequies thereof; yea as in the caſe of <hi>Joſiah</hi> his death, let their be an <hi>Anniverſary of Mourning</hi> kept in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof. However, let them not mourn like men <hi>without hope,</hi> but let them behave themſelves at the interment of his <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> as confident of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection thereof,</hi> which God in his due time ſhall raiſe out of the aſhes: It is ſown in weakneſs, it ſhall be raiſed in power; it is ſown in diſgrace, it ſhall be raiſed in glory.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">33.</note> the temporal periſhing of the righteous man in this world, minds us of the neceſſity of the day of Judgment, and ought to edge and quicken our prayers, that God would ſhortly accompliſh the number of his elect, conſummate this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable world, put a period to the dark night of his proceedings, that ſo that day, that welcome day, may begin to dawn, which is tearmed by the Apoſtle, <hi>The day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note> Five things there are (beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others) in the primitive part of Gods juſtice, which are very hard for men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
               <p>Firſt, How the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> to which we did never perſonally conſent, can juſtly be imputed to us his poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="583" facs="tcp:47453:299"/>Secondly, How infants, who never committed actual ſin, are ſubject to death; and which is more, to damnation it ſelf?</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Exod. 14.4.</note> How God can actually harden the hearts of ſome, as he did <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ohs,</hi> and yet not be in the leaſt degree acceſſary to ſin, and the author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, How the <hi>Americans</hi> can juſtly be condemned, to whom the ſound of the Goſpel was never trumpetted forth, and they by their invincible ignorance unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Gods will in his word?</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">37.</note> How God, as it in the Text, can ſuffer <hi>righteous men to periſh in their righteouſneſs, and wicked men to flowriſh in their iniquity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all theſe, a <hi>thin vail</hi> may ſeem to hang before them, ſo that we have not a full and free view of the reaſons of Gods proceedings herein; yet ſo, as that under and thorow <hi>this vail,</hi> we diſcover enough in modeſty and ſobriety to ſatisfie our ſelves, though (perchange unable to utter what in part we apprehend) we cannot effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remove all the ſcruples which the pious, nor all the cavils which the profane man brings againſt us. But at the day of <hi>judgment,</hi> at the <hi>revelation of the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God,</hi> this <hi>vail</hi> ſhall be turned back, or rather totally taken away, ſo that all ſhall plainly and perſpicuouſly perceive the juſtice of Gods dealing in the caſes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. Not that then or there, any new eſſential addition or acceſſion ſhall accrue to Gods juſtice, to mend or make up, any former deſault or defect therein; but his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings (which before wanted not clearneſs in themſelves, but clearing to our eyes) ſhall then be pronounced, declared, and adjudged juſt, in the preſence of Devils, men and Angels; ſo that ignorance ſhall not doubt, nor impudence dare to deny the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>But before we take our final farewel of the words in our Text,
<note place="margin">38.</note> know they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo capable of another ſence, <hi>I have ſeen the righteous man periſh in his righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, I have ſeen a good man, continuing in goodneſs, and ſnatched away in the prime of his years, whileſt wicked men, perſiſting in their profaneſs, have prolonged their lives to the utmoſt poſſibility of nature. I confeſs Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will in no caſe allow the word <hi>periſhing,</hi> to be applied to the death of the Godly, but ſtartles at the expreſſion, as containing ſome Pagan impiety therein, pointing at it, as an Atheiſtical poſition:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Then they alſo which are faln aſleep in Chriſt, are periſhed.</hi> However, in a qualified ſence, (not for a total extinction, but temporal ſuſpenſion of them in this world) the Prophet pronounceth it of a juſt mans death,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.1.</note> 
                  <hi>The righteous periſh, and no man layeth it to his heart;</hi> Yet, as if ſuſpecting ſome ill uſe might be made of that term <hi>periſhing,</hi> in the next words he mollifieth the harſhneſs thereof, and (who beſt might) expounds his own meaning: <hi>The righteous man is taken away from the evil to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed,
<note place="margin">39. Gen. 25.8.</note> when a juſt man dyeth, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>a good old age,</hi> he is not properly ſaid to be <hi>taken away,</hi> but, in Scripture-Phraſe, to <hi>tarry till God comes.</hi> Thus when <hi>Peter</hi> was very inquiſitive to know how <hi>John</hi> ſhould be diſpoſed of, Chriſt anſwered him,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 21.22.</note> 
                  <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? John,</hi> of all the Jury of the Apoſtles, dyed in his bed, a thorow old man, of <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>temperance,</hi> of a ſtrong and healthful natural conſtitution, moderate in diet, paſſions and recreations, (<hi>Ahijah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> may be inſtances) are cut off by an untimely death;
<note place="margin">Kings. 14.13.</note> ſuch are properly ſaid to be taken away.</p>
               <p>Now even ſuch men,
<note place="margin">40.</note> God (not only without the leaſt ſtain to his Juſtice, but in great manifeſtation of his mercy) may cauſe to <hi>periſh;</hi> or if that be too harſh a tearm, may take them away from the evil to come: And that in three ſeveral accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Firſt to keep him from that evil of ſin which God in his wiſdom foreſees the good man would commit, if living longer, and left to thoſe manifold temptations which fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times (growing daily worſe and worſe) would preſent to, and preſs on him. True it is, God could by his reſtraining and effectual Grace keep him, though ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in ſinful times, from being polluted therewith: but being a free Agent, he will vary the ways of his working, ſometimes keeping men <hi>in the hour of temptation,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>from the hour of temptation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 3.10.</note> The later he doth, ſometimes by keeping the hour <pb n="584" facs="tcp:47453:300"/>from coming to them, or rather, from coming to the hour; making them to fall ſhort thereof, and preventing their approach thereunto, by taking them away in a ſpeedy death. Thus mothers and Nurſes ſuſpecting their children would too much play the wantons, diſgrace them, and wrong themſelves; when much company is expected at their houſes, haſte them to bed betimes, even before their ordinary hour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From the evil of ſin which other men would commit, and he beheld, to the great grief and anguiſh of his heart,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Lot</hi>-like: for that <hi>righteous man dwelling among them, in ſeeing and hearing, vexed his righteous ſoul from day to day, with their unlawful deeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Manifold Uſes might be made of the Juſt mans thus periſhing in his righteouſneſs.
<note place="margin">41.</note> Firſt, men ought to be affected with true ſorrow: yet the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous periſheth, and no man layeth it to his heart.</hi> Surely his wife or children will (or elſe the more unworthy) haply he hath none when dying. His kindred will, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept (which is impoſſible) with <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb: 7.3.</note> he be <hi>without father, without mother, without deſcent.</hi> His friends will, though rather the rich than the righteous have friends whileſt living, and leave them when dying. But to ſatisfie all objections at once. By <hi>none,</hi> are meant very few, inconſiderable in reſpect of thoſe multitudes that paſs the righteous mans death unreſpected. Parallel to that place in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov: 2: 19.</note> 
                  <hi>None that go to her return again, neither take they hold of the path of life.</hi> Not that adultery is the ſin againſt the <hi>holy Ghoſt, unpardonable;</hi> but <hi>veſtigia pauca retrorſum.</hi> Be thou, by an holy Riddle, <hi>One</hi> among that <hi>None;</hi> I mean a mourner in Sion for the righteous mans death, amongſt theſe very few, who lay it to their hearts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Men from hence are ſeriouſly to recollect and apply to themſelves the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their mortallities, when thee ſee <hi>the righteous man periſh in his righteouſneſs.</hi> There is a bird peculiar to <hi>Ireland,</hi> called the <hi>Cock of the Wood,</hi> remarkable for the fine fleſh and folly thereof: All the difficulty to kill them, is to find them out, otherwiſe a mean marksman may eaſily kill them. They flie in woods in flocks, and if one of them be ſhot, the reſt remove not but to the next bow or tree at the furtheſt, &amp; there ſtand ſtaring at the ſhooter, till the whole covy be deſtroyed. As fooliſh as the bird is, it is wiſe enough to be the embleme of the wiſeſt men in point of mortallity. Death ſweeps away one, and one, and one, and the reſt remain no whit moved at, or mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, till at laſt a whole generation is conſumed.</p>
               <p>It fareth with the moſt mens lives, as with the ſand in this hypocritical hour-glaſs: behold it in outward appearance, and it ſeemeth far more then it is, becauſe riſing upon the ſides, whileſt the ſand is empty and hollow in the midſt thereof; ſo that when it ſinks down in and inſtant, a quarter of an hour is gone in a moment. Thus many men are miſtaken in their own account, reckoning upon three-ſcore and ten years, the age of a man, becauſe their bodies appear outwardly ſtrong and luſty. Alas! their health may be hollow, there may be ſome inward infirmity and imperfection unknown unto them, ſo that death may ſurpriſe them on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They are to take notice of Gods anger, with that place from which the <hi>righteous man is taken away.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſpeaking of the death of an ordinary man, ſaith, <hi>The living will lay it to heart:</hi> But when a <hi>righteous man is taken away,</hi> the living ought to lay it to the very <hi>Heart of their hearts,</hi> eſpecially if he be a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate or Miniſter of eminent note. When the eye-ſtrings break, the heart-ſtrings hold not out long after: and when the <hi>ſeers</hi> are taken away, it is a ſad ſymptome of a languiſhing Church or Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Men ought to imitate the vertuous examples of ſuch as are dead. The cloud and pillar at the Red-ſea,
<note place="margin">Exod. 14.20.</note> was bright toward the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to guide and direct them with the light thereof: but the reverſe or back part thereof, was dark toward the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> In the beſt men there is ſuch a mixture of light and darkneſs, who with their vertues have may fanlts, failings and infirmities. Well let the <hi>Egyptian</hi> walk by his dark ſide, follow his faults, whileſt the <hi>Iſrael of God,</hi> all pious people, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to imitate his virtues, directed in their converſations, by the luſtre of his godly <pb n="585" facs="tcp:47453:300"/>examples.
<note place="margin">Mat. 14.2,</note> That ſo as <hi>Herod</hi> hearing of the ſame of Chriſt, conceived that <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt was riſen again from the dead: ſo let us labour that our vertuous lives may give juſt cauſe for others to conceive, that thoſe <hi>righteous men</hi> which have <hi>periſhed in their righteouſneſs,</hi> thoſe <hi>champions</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>worthy Heroes of holineſs</hi> long ſince deceaſed, are revived again, and have in us a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous reſurrection.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="588" facs="tcp:47453:302"/>Now as I am charitably confident that all who hear me this day,
<note place="margin">4</note> are ſatisfied and aſſured herein, That our Saviours body ſaw no corruption, ſo give me leave to be jealous over you with a godly jealouſie, for fear ſome miſtake the cauſe of this his incorruptibility, and bottome it on a falſe foundation. Some perchance may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to the ſhortneſs of the time he lay in his grave, being but a day and two pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a day, <hi>numero rotundo,</hi> though <hi>currente ſtilo</hi> they commonly be called and counted three dayes. Theſe do <hi>ponere non cauſam pro cauſa;</hi> for the time was long enough in that hot Countrey, to cauſe putrefaction, conſidering that our Saviours body was much bruiſed and broken with the whips, nails, and ſpears, (beſides the effuſion of much blood) which would the ſooner have invited corruption.</p>
               <p>Others perchance put the untaintedneſs of his body upon the account of the great quantity of <hi>Myrrh</hi> and <hi>Aloes (about an hundred pound weight)</hi> and other precious ſpices,
<note place="margin">5</note> wherewith <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus, John</hi> 19.39. imbalmed it.

               </p>
               <p>The true reaſon is this:
<note place="margin">6</note> Though Chriſts ſoul was parted from his body, (and where diſpoſed of, God only knows, during his remainder in the grave) yet the union with the Deity was never diſſolved, which priviledged his corpſe from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. So that had it been poſſible (which was impoſſible, as is inconſiſtant with Gods promiſe and pleaſure) for his corpſe to have lien in the grave till this inſtant, they had been perpetuated in an intire eſtate, whilſt it is true of <hi>David</hi> as it is in the Text, <hi>after he had ſerved his own generation by the will of God, he fell on ſleep, and was laid unto his Fathers, and ſaw corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obſerve in the words four principal parts;

                     <item>1. What a generation is.</item>

                     <item>4. How we after his example are to ſerve ours.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Of theſe in order, and firſt we will conſider what a generation is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A generation is a company of men and women,</hi>

Thus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.17. <hi>All the generations from</hi> Abraham <hi>to</hi> David, <hi>are fourteen generations: and from</hi> David, <hi>until the carrying away into</hi> Babylon, <hi>are fourteen generations: and from the carrying away into</hi> Babylon, <hi>unto Chriſt, are fourteen Generations:</hi> Now all generations are not of equal extent; ſo admirable the Longevity of thoſe before the Flood, compared to our ſhort lives, ſince God for our ſins hath contracted the <hi>cloth</hi> of our life to <hi>threeſcore &amp; ten years,</hi> and all is but a courſe <hi>Liſt,</hi> which is more then that meaſure, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90.10. <hi>And if by reaſon of ſtrength they be fourſcore years, yet is their ſtrength, labour and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, for it is ſoon cut off, and we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>It is remarkable,
<note place="margin">9</note> that Three Generations are alwayes at the ſame time on foot in the world; namely,

               <p>For ſhould God clear the earth of all men at once, mankind could not be recru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but by miracle; beſides, neither humane Arts nor Sciences; nor could the Scripture handſomly be handed and delivered from one generation to another. God therefore of his goodneſs doth ſo order it, that rather then any empty Interval ſhould happen betwixt them, one Generation ſhould fold and lap over another. Theſe three degrees were moſt viſibly conſpicuous in the Levites, which till five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of age, were <hi>learning Levites,</hi> thence till fifty, <hi>acting Levites,</hi> as being then in the ſtrength of their age) imployed in the portage of the Tabernacle, and after fifty, had a Writ of eaſe from bodily labour, though they may be preſumed to be buſied in the teaching of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="589" facs="tcp:47453:302"/>Paſs we now to explain what it is to ſerve our Generation.
<note place="margin">10.</note> To ſerve it, is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our conſciences according to Gods will in his word, to our ſuperiours, equals, inferiours, all perſons to whom we ſtand related in our generation. And the more eminent the perſon is in Church and State, the more are his references multiplyed, and the more publick and ponderous the ſervice is which he is to perform. Nor muſt it be forgotten, that <hi>David</hi> was a King, in which reſpect it was proper for him to rule and command his own Generation; and yet it is ſaid, he ſerved the ſame. Princes are not priviledged by their greatneſs, only to tyrannize over others, but are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God, how well they diſcharge their duty to all ſuch to whom they are reſpected.</p>
               <p>Proceed we to ſee how <hi>David</hi> ſerved his generation,
<note place="margin">11.</note> which he did in an eight-fold capacity. Firſt, as a dutiful ſon to his Father and Mother, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.3. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>went thence to</hi> Nizpeh of Moab, <hi>and he ſaid unto the King of</hi> Moab, <hi>Let my Father and Mother, I pray thee come forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me. And be brought them before the King of</hi> Moab, <hi>and they dwelt with him all the while that</hi> David <hi>was in the hold.</hi> The caſe was thus, <hi>David</hi> foreſaw that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of <hi>Sauls</hi> fury would fall full heavy on his Fathers family; he foreſaw alſo that though he himſelf might be alwayes on the <hi>wing,</hi> hunted from place to place as a Partridge on the Mountain, yet his aged Parents could not keep pace with his ſuddain, uncertain, unſeaſonable, late and long removeance, and therefore as a dutiful ſon, he provided for them a private place of peaceable repoſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">12.</note> he ſerved his generation as a very loving Brother, witneſs the dangerous viſit (whith at his Fathers command) he gave his Brethren in the Camp, (when <hi>Goliah</hi> was in the field) victualling them with all neceſſary proviſion, on the ſame token that he received nothing for his pains ſave a jeer from <hi>Eliab</hi> his eldeſt brother. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.28. <hi>Why cameſt thou down hither? and with whom haſt thou left thoſe few ſheep in the wilderneſs? I know thy pride and the naughtineſs of thine heart; for thou art come down, that thou mighteſt ſee the battle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">13.</note> he ſerved his ganeration as a kind and carefull Husband. I will not excuſe his Polygamy, having many wives at once, nor dare I flatly condemn it, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving thereat in the antient Patriarches. However <hi>David</hi> cannot be charged with want of love amongſt his ſtore of wives. Once I confeſs he made a tart and ſharp return to <hi>Miehal,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.21. mocking him for dancing before the Ark. But <hi>was there not a cauſe,</hi> when through the ſides of <hi>David</hi> ſhe ſtruck at all true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion? and ſmartneſs on ſuch occaſion is zeal, and no treſpaſs againſt Marital af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">14.</note> he ſerved his generation as a tender Father indeed; he faulty, it was <hi>in</hi> the exceſs, being over-indulgent to <hi>Abſolom</hi> and <hi>Adoniah,</hi> whom he never took to task nor called to account, (1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 1.6.) <hi>Why have you done ſo?</hi> (and ſeeing he would not uſe the rod on them, God therefore uſed them as a rod on him) ſuch cockerings we confeſs is a catching diſeaſe amongſt us parents; but to give <hi>David</hi> his due, for the main, he behaved himſelf no doubt as a diſcreet and tender Father to his numerous iſſue.</p>
               <p>Fifthly,
<note place="margin">15.</note> he was a faſt and faithful Friend; witneſs the exchange of hearts as well as cloathes, which paſſed betwixt him and <hi>Jonathan:</hi> yea <hi>David</hi> made a tripartite expreſſion of his affection. 1. He loved <hi>Jonathan</hi> in his life. 2. Lamented him at, 3. <hi>Shewed mercy to him, after his death, 2 Sam.</hi> 6.3. in reſtoring <hi>Nephiboſeth</hi> to all his lands, and making him <hi>Fellow-Commoner</hi> at his own Table; So that we may truly ſay and juſtifie the expreſſion, <hi>There was two men,</hi> Jonathan <hi>and</hi> David; and it will be made good by the Rules of Amity, if any queſtion the phraſe in the Rule of Grammer.</p>
               <p>Sixthly,
<note place="margin">16.</note> he was a loyal Subject, whereof he gave two ſignal teſtimonies, like to find more to admire then to imitate them amongſt poſterity, if any ſhould chance to be eſtated in his condition with the ſame advantage: For being Reverſion'd to the Crown, he twice had an opportunity (if ſo pleaſed) to put himſelf into the preſent poſſeſſion thereof. Once when he had <hi>Saul</hi> in the Cave, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. and his heart ſmote him for being over-bold with Gods annointed, though he did but cut off <pb n="590" facs="tcp:47453:303"/>a skirt of his Garment. Again, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.12. <hi>When he found</hi> Saul <hi>a ſleeping, and (if ſo diſpoſed) might have left him a ſleeping,</hi> till the ſound of the laſt Trumpet ſhould ſummon him to awake. A ſurly General walking the Round, and finding one of his Centinels aſleep, nailed him with his ſpear to the earth, and excuſed his act with this jeſt, (whether witty or cruel, let others judge) <hi>Dormientem inveni, Dormientem reliqui; Sleeping I found him, and ſleeping I left him. David</hi> might have done the like, eſpecially ſeeing <hi>Abiſha</hi> (not to ſay Providence) impelled him thereunto, but would not (as having a principle of piety within him, which remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt ſuch proceedings.)</p>
               <p>Seventhly,
<note place="margin">17.</note> he was a prudent Soveraign both in peace and war, in Court and Camp, for the ſpace of full forty years, going in and out before the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he ruled prudently with all his might. I confeſs his ſon <hi>Abſolom</hi> taxed him with neglect of the affairs of State, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.3. that no man was deputed by him to hear the cauſes and redreſs the grievances of his oppreſſed ſubjects. But what ſaith our plain proverb, <hi>Ill will never ſpeaks well.</hi> And therefore I liſten to <hi>Abſoloms</hi> words as to a loud Libell; and we ſhould be no leſs injurious to our own judgements then to <hi>Davids</hi> innocence, in giving credit to a proud ambitions ſon, againſt an holy and humble Father.</p>
               <p>Eightly and laſtly,
<note place="margin">18.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> ſerved his generation as a gracious Saint; this was the Diamond of the Ring, and I have kept the beſt wine for the laſt, to cloſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Davids</hi> character therewith. He is termed in this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>a man after Gods own heart,</hi> being the beſt tranſcript or copy of the beſt Original.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">19.</note> But you wittingly, and willingly, and wilfully, will ſome ſay, have ſuppreſſed and concealed a neceſſary truth, becauſe tending to <hi>Davids</hi> diſparagement. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3. that <hi>ſome men ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> and ſo did <hi>David</hi> himſelf. He did not <hi>ſerve his generation,</hi> but his own wicked wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when he imbroydered his Adultery with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> with the Murder of <hi>Uriah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">20.</note> O not a word, not a ſyllable, not a letter, not a tittle hereof. God hath forgotten it, why ſhould man remember it? God hath caſt it behind his back, why ſhould we caſt it in the teeth of <hi>Davids</hi> memory? let us never mention it to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, but for our own direction; Partly to teach us not to truſt in our ſelves, leſt we fall into ſin; partly to comfort us, that after ſin committed, pardon is obtainable on our unfeigned repentance.</p>
               <p>Yea this is a very comfortable conſideration,
<note place="margin">21.</note> That though there be many faults, failings and defects in our performances, yet if there be ſincerity (Goſpel perfection) therein, if our hearts be ſet to ſeek the Lord God of our Fathers, God will be mercifull unto us, though we be not purified according to the purification of the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Lot</hi> (not withſtanding the ſoul fact of Inceſt committed by him) is called a righteous man,
<note place="margin">22.</note> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. Men opprobriouſly taint and term people by the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of one irregular act, which with uncharitable tongues is enough to ecclipſe, yea extinguiſh the credit of all other graces in him; but God doth Denominate and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite perſons from the rectitude of the general habit of their lives; yea, by him ſuch ſhall be reputed, accepted, received <hi>to ſerve our generation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude the point,
<note place="margin">23.</note> he was a witty man who firſt taught ſtones to ſpeak by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graving of Epitaphs upon them: But he was a wicked man who firſt taught ſtones to lie, abuſing poſterity with notorious untruths in flattering Inſcriptions on many Monuments; but I call malice it ſelf to witneſs, whether the enſuing Epitaph might not with modeſt truth being raved on <hi>Davids</hi> Sepulchre;</p>
               <p>Here lieth interred the Corpſe of him who when living, was a dutiful Son, a loving Brother, a kind Husband, a tender Father, a faithfull Friend, a loyall Subject, a provident Soveraign, a gracious Saint; in a word, one who ſerved his own Generation after the will of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="591" facs="tcp:47453:303"/>But ſhould I ſtop here,
<note place="margin">24.</note> I ſhould not do right to <hi>Davids</hi> deſerts. Be it known, that beſides the ſerving his own Generation, <hi>David</hi> did and doth ſerve all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world as long as time ſhall laſt, as being the inſtrumental Author of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi> Far be it from me to make odious compariſons between either perſons or things that are eminent, or to ſet difference betwixt Gods Word (as once the Diſciples fell out amongſt themſelves which ſhould be the greateſt) which is the moſt heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part thereof; but ſurely the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are inferiour to no part of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rabins</hi> have a fond conceit,
<note place="margin">25.</note> that <hi>Manna</hi> did reliſh in the mouths of men as the Eaters thereof did fancy to themſelves, having the Guſt of fleſh, fiſh or fowl, roaſt, boyl'd, or bak'd, as the eater thereof did wiſh or deſire: I call this a fond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, as contrary to an expreſs in Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.31. wherein the taſte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is confined to wafers made with honey. But this I will boldly ſay and maintain, that the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> ſhall reliſh to an hungry ſoul, as he ſhall (not out of humour and cauſeleſs fancy, but) judiciouſly deſire it. Wouldſt thou have it taſte bitter? it ſhall taſte bitter and reprove thee; taſte ſweet? it ſhall taſte ſweet and comfort thee; taſte betwixt both, bitter-ſweet? it ſhall bitter-ſweet counſel and adviſe thee.</p>
               <p>Proceed we now to application:
<note place="margin">26.</note> It ſerveth to confute three forts of people; Firſt, the covetous, who are ſo far from ſerving their Generation, that they will ſcarce ſerve themſelves, and allow neceſſaries for their own comfortable ſubſiſtance. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the voluptuous man, who only ſerveth himſelf and is good to no other. Theſe inſtead of ſaying, Let us faſt and pray; ſay, Let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall die. Thirdly the ſuperſtitious man, who immureth himſelf in a Cloyſter, crying his life up for an high piece of holineſs, burying both his parts and perſon therein. Surely the Church and State he liveth in, may juſtly commence a ſuit, and have an action of debt againſt him, for not repaying them proportionably to his abilities, who by his lazineſs will not ſerve his Generation.</p>
               <p>Others there are,
<note place="margin">27.</note> who are ſo far from ſerving their Generation, That they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and do much miſchief thereunto, either by their bad writings or vicious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Bad writings, either ſcurrilous againſt modeſty, or ſcandalous againſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or blaſphemous againſt piety, as either in maintaining erroneous opinions, or defending vicious practiſes; ſuch black broods are bad whileſt in their neſts, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſtudies of their Authors, but well worſe when fledg'd and flown abroad into the world, ſo that it is not in the power of the Hen to clock in her own Chickens again, and recall what they have compoſed.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">28.</note> they are not only unprofitable, but deſtructive ſervants to poſterity, who leave the Copies of bad examples behind them, ſo that they know not when they have done ſinning; yea it is to be ſeared, that whilſt their ſouls are ſuffering in a woful place,
<note place="margin">Lib. nono</note> they ſtill may be ſinning here on earth. If it be true what <hi>Symmachus</hi> faith,
<note place="margin">Ep. 70.</note> 
                  <hi>Author eſt bonorum ſequentium qui bonum relinquit exemplum;</hi> By the ſame proportion, he that liveth an ill Precedent, is the Father and Founder of all the evil which may inſue thereupon; like <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſeldom mentioned in Scripture but with his train ſweeping after him, <hi>the ſon of</hi> Nebat <hi>which made Iſrael to ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God grant that when we die,
<note place="margin">29.</note> our ſins may be buried in our Graves, or rather (which is a more Chriſtian expreſſion, and more conformable to the proportion of Faith) that before we die, our ſins may be buried in Chriſts grave, pardoned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given unto us, eſpecially that we leave not behind us ill examples for the poyſoning and perverting of ſuch as ſhall ſurvive us. For as it is ſaid of <hi>Abel, Heb.</hi> 11.4. <hi>He being dead yet ſpeaketh:</hi> ſo it is ſadly true of many who are dead and rotten, that they ſtill <hi>lye, curſe, ſwear,</hi> here on earth, occaſioning the ſame in others by their wicked patterns and practiſes they have left behind them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">30.</note> But ſome will plead themſelves priviledged and exempted from ſerving their Generation, becauſe of the badneſs thereof. <hi>David</hi> (ſay they) had ſome comfort in, and credit by <hi>ſerving his Generation,</hi> having for his <hi>Time-fellows</hi> ſo many Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies in all profeſſions. Worthy Prieſts, <hi>Abimelech, Abiathar, Zadock;</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Captains, <hi>Joab, Abiſhar, Benaiah,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jehojedah;</hi> worthy States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <pb n="592" facs="tcp:47453:304"/>
                  <hi>Huſha, Adoniram;</hi> worthy Prophets, <hi>Nathan, Gad, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas I live in ſuch a Generation, that all the bad Epethites in the old and new Teſtament may truly be applyed thereunto. <hi>A ſtubborn generation, a froward generation,</hi> Pſal. 78.8. <hi>A rebellious generation, a generation that ſet not their heart aright, and whoſe Spirit is not ſtedfaſt with God.</hi> A generation of vipers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7. A faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs generation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.17. Whether you take it in <hi>Divinity</hi> for lack of belief towards God, or in <hi>morality</hi> for want of truth and truſt towards man; and who can find in his heart to ſerve ſo wicked a generation?</p>
               <p>Some will ſay,
<note place="margin">31</note> (further to improve this Objection) O that I had been born ſome years after the perſecution in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſo my <hi>three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten years,</hi> the age of man, might have run parallel with the proſperous times of <hi>Queen Elizabeth, King James,</hi> and <hi>King Charles,</hi> and have determined and expired ſome years before the beginning of our late civil wars: Had my nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity been fixed in that peaceable poſition, O then I would willingly, and readily, and chearfully, and joyfully, and thankfully have ſerved my own generation; whereas now I have no liſt, and leſs comfort to do it, being condemned to live in ſo wicked an age, made up of the dregs of time, the badneſs whereof is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then difficult to deſcribe, and may with more ſafety be confeſt by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then expreſt by the Preacher in his place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have three things to return in anſwer hereunto.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">32</note> grant the Objector ſpeaketh very much of truth herein, yet if the times be ſo bad as he complaineth, their badneſs will ſerve for a toyl to ſet off his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and render it the more conſpicuous, making him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. <hi>to ſhine the brighter, as a light in the World, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Nation.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, thy little faith would have made no ſhow, hadſt thou lived in the age of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> thy Patience would have ſeemed but a dwarf to the Gyant patience of <hi>Job,</hi> hadſt thou been his contemporary; thy meekneſs had appeared as nothing, if mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured with the meekneſs of <hi>Moſes,</hi> had you been partners in the ſame generation. Whereas now a little Faith, Patience, Meekneſs, and ſo of other graces, will make a very good preſence in the publick, if the Age thou liveſt in be ſo bad as thou doſt complain, and others perchance do believe.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">33</note> I ſuſpect this to be nothing elſe but a device of thy deceitful heart, thereby to cozen thine own ſelf. The Objection ſpeaks the ſtate of thy ſoul to be much like the temper of the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.30. <hi>If we</hi> (ſay they) <hi>had been in the dayes of our Fathers, we would not have been partaker with the blood of the Prophets.</hi> Yet theſe pretended pittiful perſons were indeed more cruel then their Anceſtors. Their Fathers killed the Men, they the Maſter; their Fathers the Servant, they the Son; their Fathers murdered the Prophets of God, they the God of thoſe Prophets, ſo far forth as he was murderable in his humane nature; and it is vehemently to be ſuſpected, that if thou beeſt bad now, thou wouldſt not have been good, had the time of thy Nativity anſwered thine own deſire. It is a ſhrewd preſumption, that he who behaved himſelf as a <hi>Woolf</hi> in his own generation, would not have been a <hi>Lamb</hi> in what Age ſoever he had lived.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,
<note place="margin">34</note> 
                  <hi>Beggars muſt be no chooſers;</hi> thou art not to ſerve the generation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, nor the generation after thee, nor any other of thy own election, but thy own generation, wherein Divine Providence hath been pleaſed to place thee, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 5.22. <hi>Wives ſubmit your ſelves unto your own Husbands.</hi> Some will ſay, had I ſuch an one to my Husband, I could willingly obey him, he is of ſo meek, mild and ſweet a diſpoſition, but mine is of ſo moroſe and froward a nature, it goes againſt my nature to be dutiful unto him. However, though ſhe hath not the ſame comfort, ſhe hath the ſame cauſe of ſubmiſſion, obliging in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to Gods command; husbands muſt love their own wives, wives obey their own husbands; husbands and wives with <hi>David,</hi> muſt ſerve their own generation.</p>
               <p>But now that my ſword may cut on both ſides,
<note place="margin">35</note> as hitherto we have confuted ſuch who are faulty in their defect, and will not ſerve their generation; ſo others offend in the exceſs, not being only ſervants, but ſlaves and vaſſals to the age they live in, proſtituting their conſciences to do any thing (how unjuſt ſoever) to be a Favourite <pb n="593" facs="tcp:47453:304"/>to the Times: Surely a cautious concealment is lawful, and wary ſilence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable <hi>in perilous times.</hi> Amos 5.13. <hi>It is an evil time, therefore the wiſe ſhall hold their peace.</hi> And I confeſs that a prudential compliance in Religion in things indifferent, is juſtifiable, as alſo in all civil concernments, wherein the conſcience is not violated: but wherein the will of the times croſſeth the will of God, our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures are cancelled from ſerving them, and God only is to be obeyed.</p>
               <p>There is ſome difference in reading the precept,
<note place="margin">36</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. occaſioned from the ſimilitude of the words in the original, (though utterly unlike in our Engliſh tongue) ſome reading it ſerving the Lord, others ſerving the time. I will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute which in the Greek is the truer Copie, but do obſerve that <hi>Davids</hi> precedent in my Text, is a perfect expedient, to demonſtrate that both Lections may and ought to be reconciled in our practiſe: <hi>He ſerved his generation,</hi> there is <hi>ſerving the times;</hi> but what followeth? <hi>by the will of God,</hi> there is ſerving the Lord; this by him was, by us muſt be performed.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">37</note> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 7.2. began his Sermon to the people with theſe words, Men, Brethren, and Fathers; which words I thus expound and apply. By <hi>Men,</hi> he meant young folk, which had attained to the ſtrength and ſtature of men, and were much younger then himſelf. By <hi>Brethren,</hi> thoſe of his own ſtanding and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niority in the world (probably forty years old or thereabouts) and therefore he ſaluted ſuch with a familiar Appellation as a badge of equallity. Thirdly <hi>Fathers,</hi> being aged people, more ancient then himſelf, as appeareth by his term of reſpect addreſſed to perſons diſtanced above him. This diſtinction will ſerve me, firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to compriſe, then methodically to diſtinguiſh all my Auditors in this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>I begin with you men,
<note place="margin">38</note> which are of the <hi>Generation riſing,</hi> it being bootleſs for me to addreſs my ſelf to children not arrived at their underſtanding, concerning whom I turn my preaching to them into praying for them, and wiſh them good ſucceſs in the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>It is your bounden duty to omit no opportunity to inform your ſelves both in
<note place="margin">39</note> Learning and Religion, from thoſe that living with you are of more age and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and demean your ſelves unto them with all reverence and reſpect. O let them go fairly their own pace and path to their graves.

If we live long, we ſhall be lookt upon as the barren fig-tree that combereth the ground; we muſt make room for ſucceſſion, as our fathers have done for us. And ſet this be our greateſt care, to derive and deliver Religion in all the foundamentals thereof, in as good a plight and condition to our ſons, as we received it from our Fathers. O let us leave Gods houſe as tenantable as we found it, let it not be ſaid, that we willingly let the fair Fabrick of Faith and good life to run to ruine in our, ſo that the next Age may juſtly ſue us for Dilapidations.</p>

<note place="margin">44</note> whom my loyalty cannot paſs by without doing my due homage to the <hi>Crown of your Age,</hi> eſpecially if it be found in the way of truth. Give me leave to tell, you belong to that generation which is paſſed out of this world: not only the Van or Front, and alſo the main body and battel of your Army are marched to their graves (and their ſouls I hope to heaven) whilſt Divine Providence for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, hath reſerved you to bring up (as I may ſay) the very rear of the rear of your generation. O do not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake this Reprieve for a Pardon; and here give me leave to uſe a plain but expreſſive Similitude.</p>
               <p>Have you never ſeen a wanton child run a firebrand againſt the Hearth or back of

               <p>We read,
<note place="margin">46</note> 
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.2. of an Angel who had his right foot on the Sea, and his left on the earth. This may ſeem a ſtrange ſtride, ſave that it abateth the wonder, becauſe Angels when pleaſed to aſſume bodies, may extend themſelves to a vaſt (though fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite) proportion. But you, though meer men, and weak men, muſt ſtride a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; having your left foot already in the Grave, endeavour to have your right foot in Heaven, and waving all love of this world, ſet your minds and meditations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone on God and godlineſs. In a word, whatever our Age be, riſing, ſhining, or ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Men, Brethren or Fathers, let us endeavour with <hi>David</hi> in my Text, according to the will of God to ſerve our own Generation.</p>
               <p>Come we now to the ſad occaſion of our preſent meeting,
<note place="margin">47</note> to perform the laſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Office to our Deceaſed Brother, well known to many of you, and to none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then to my ſelf. A child is like a man in the ſimilitude of parts, though not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and in ſome meaſure he did ſincerely with <hi>David</hi> ſerve his Generation. He was a dutiful Son unto his aged Mother, as ſhe cannot but confeſs, and will I hope (as occaſion is offered) remember and reward it to his wife and children. A loving Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a kind Husband, and I doubt not but his widdow will diſcharge her mutual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him in his relations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bathſheha</hi> thus deſcribeth a good wife,
<note place="margin">48</note> 
                  <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.12. <hi>She will do her Husband good and not evil all the dayes of her life.</hi> It is not ſaid, all the dayes of his life, <hi>but of her life.</hi> What if he ſhould chance to die, and ſhe to ſurvive him, yea after to marry again, (as God forbid any ſhould be debarred marrying in the Lord, eſpecially for their own and childrens advantage) yet ſtill ſhe would do good unto him all the dayes of her life. To him, that is to his memory, mentioning with reſpect: to him, that is to his children and friends, careful over the one, and curteous over the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="595" facs="tcp:47453:305"/>He was a tender Father and faithful Friend, witneſs the many <hi>volunteer mourners,</hi> (an unuſual proportion for a perſon of his quality) who at their own charge have habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves, that the outward ſadneſs of their cloaths might expreſs the inward ſorrow of their hearts: He was an excellent Maſter, having bred many good workmen in his Vocation, and I hope they will prove good husbands too. Let me add, he was an excellent ſubject; for according to that which his conſcience (with many others) conceived to be loyalty: he loſt much of, and hazarded all his eſtate.</p>
               <p>Laſtly and chiefly, he was a good Saint, having more piety then he ſhewed, and as daily he conſumed in his body, he was ſtrengthened in his ſoul in Faith through Chriſt, whereof he gave many teſtimonies before, towards, and at his death. What ſhall I ſpeak of his parts of Nature, ſo far above his education and profeſſion, that he might have paſt for a Scholar amongſt Scholars, for his wit and pleaſant expreſſions: But God now hath made him his <hi>free-man,</hi> and paid him his wages for ſo well ſerving his Generation.</p>

               <p>A third Quaerie is,
<note place="margin">Quaer. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſpake all this, as out of a ſelf-confidence, without having an eye to Gods Divine aſſiſtance therein?</hi>

               <p>The fourth,
<note place="margin">Quae; 4.</note> and laſt Querie is, <hi>How Saint</hi> Paul <hi>came to know ſo aſſuredly, that there was a Crown of Righteouſneſs laid up for him in Heaven?</hi>

                  </note> To which ſome anſwer, that he had it by Revelation extroardinary, as an Apoſtolical priviledge daigned to him from God, the better to chear him on in the courſe of the Goſpel, and to ſteel his reſolutions againſt all oppoſers of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truth therein revealed: or, as <hi>Anſelme</hi> thus, He had that aſſurance, <hi>Non re pleniſſima, ſed ſpe firmiſſima:</hi> grounded upon a firm hope, and expectation: But of this more anon.</p>
               <p>Having thus pointed at the Quaeries: I come now to the more particular hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the words, out of which I obſerve two general parts,</p>

               <p>Thirdly, (that I may haſten) this is difficult, in regard of the great progreſs, that an Hypocrite, or a Caſt-away, may make in the wayes of Chriſtianity, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain to this aſſurance; He may have ſome degrees of Illumination, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. much like a Coruſcation, that a ſuddain flaſh of Lighting maketh in the Ayre; He may have good wiſhes as <hi>Balaam, Numbers</hi> 23.10.

               </p>
               <p>There yet remains but one Pearl more in the Cabinet of this Text, which I ſhall onely offer to your ſhort notice, and ſo conclude; it is that due qualification which renders other Chriſtians, as well as it did S. <hi>Paul,</hi> capable of the <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs;</hi> they muſt be ſuch, as who do love the Lord Chriſt's <hi>ſecond appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the day of Judgment. And, indeed, it is the property of none but Saints, to <hi>love it,</hi> and <hi>long for it.</hi> See <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. Rev. 22.20. <hi>Amen</hi> even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Some cautions, notwithſtanding, muſt be here remembred, ſith it's poſſible that times may fall out, when we tremble at the thought, or mention of it; as when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is wounded afreſh with ſome groſs act of ſin: this made <hi>David</hi> afraid, yea, to roar out, and to make a noyſe through the diſquietneſs of his ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.2. and, under that ſtate of ſoul, to begg earneſtly to be ſpared, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſtrength (in Gods favour) before he went hence, and was no more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.13. or elſe, when the Lord ſhall, for divers ends and reaſons, ſurcharge the ſoul and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with the ſins of youth, for which, perhaps, men have not, as became them, been ſufficiently humbled; thus, dealt he even with his ſervant <hi>Job,</hi> writing bitter things againſt him, <hi>Job</hi> 13.26. ſee alſo <hi>Job</hi> 16.4.</p>
