            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In deede they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that their owne cause did euerye where go to wracke, that their sleightes were nowe espyed and lesse esteemed, &amp; that their helpes did dayly fayle them, &amp; that their matter stoode altogether in great neede of a conninge spokesman.
<pb facs="tcp:1189:11"/>
Now as for those things which by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue been layed against vs, in part they be manifestly false &amp; condempned so by their owne iudgementes whiche spake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, partly again, though thei be as false to in deede, yet beare thei a certain shew and colour of truth, so as the Reader (if he take not good hede) may easily be trip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped and brought into errour by them, specially when their fine and cunninge tale is added thereunto: and part of them be of suche sorte, as wee oughte not to shunne them as crimes or faultes, but to acknowledg &amp; professe them as thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges well done, and vpon very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>For shortely to say the truth, these folke falsely accuse and slaunder all oure doinges: yea the same thinges whiche they themselues can not deny but to be rightly and orderly don, and for malice do so misconstre and depraue al our say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges and doinges, as though it were impossible, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any thinge could be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>This, lo ye, is the power of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and of men which leane more to the amased wondering of the rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and to darknes, then they doe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth and light: and as S.

But wee giue thankes to the most good &amp; mighty God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such is our cause, wher against (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they woulde faynest) they were able to vtter no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite, but the same which might aswell bee wrested againste the holye Fathers, against the Prophetes, against the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,

               </gap>ull for these folkes to be eloquent and fine ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in speaking euil, surely it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not vs in our cause, being so very good, to be dumme in answering truelye. For men to be carelesse what ys spoken by them and their own matter bee it neuer so falselye and slaunderouselye spoken, (especiallie when it is suche, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of God and the cause of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may therby be dammaged) is the part doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of dissolute and retcheles persons, &amp; of them which wickedlye winke at the iniuries don vnto the name of God. For although other wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, yea oftentimes great, may be borne and dissembled of a milde &amp; Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man, yet hee that goeth smothelye awaye and dissembleth the mater when he is noted of heresy, Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus was wont to deny that man to be a Christian. We therefore will do the same thinge which all lawes, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

owne voyce doth command to be don, and whiche Christe him selfe did in like case when he was checked and reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to the intent we may put of from vs these mens slaunderous accusations, and may defend soberly and truely our own cause and innoncencie.</p>
            <p>For Christ verelye when the Phary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies charged him with sorcery as one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had some familiar Spirites, &amp; wrought many thinges by their helpe, I saide he, haue not the Dyuell, but do <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e glorifie my Father: but it is you, that haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored me, and put me to rebuke and shame. And S. Paul when Festus the Lieutenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t scorned him as a mad man: I (saide he) moste deere Festus, am not madde as thou thinkest, but I speake the wordes of truth and sobrenes. And the auncient Christians when they wer slaundered to the people for mankillers, for adulterors, for committers of incest, for disturbers of common weales, and did perceaue that by suche slaunderous accusations y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Religion which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
<pb facs="tcp:1189:13"/>
might be brought in question, namely if they should seeme to hold their peace, and in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner to confesse the fault: lest this might hinder the free course of the Gospell, they made Orations, they put vp supplications, and made meanes to Emperors and Princes, that they might defend them selues and theyr fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in open audience.</p>
            <p>But we trulye, seeing that so many thowsandes of our brethren in these last twenty yeares haue borne witnes vnto the truth, in the middest of most painfull torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that could be deuised: and when Princes desirous to restraine the Gospel sought many wayes but preuayled no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge, and that now almost the whole worlde dothe begynne to open theyre eyes to behold the light: we take it that our cause hath already ben sufficiently declared and defended, and thinke it not needfull to make many wordes, since y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very matter saith inough for yt selfe. For yf the Popes woulde, or els if they could
<pb facs="tcp:1189:13"/>
weigh with their own selues the whole matter, and also the beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cedinges of our Religion, how in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner al their trauail hath com to nought, no body driuing it forwarde, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wordely helpe: and howe on the other side, our cause, againste the will of Emperoures, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning against the willes of so many Kynges, in spite of the Popes, and almoste maugre the head of all men, hath taken encrease, and by little and little spredde ouer into all countries, and is com at length euen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Kings courtes and Palaices. These same thinges me thinketh might bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens greate ynough to them, that God him self doth strongly fight in our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and doth from heauen laugh at their enterprises: &amp; that the force of the truth is suche, as neither mans power, nor yet hell gates are able to roote it oute. For they be not all mad at this day, so many free Cities, so manye Kynges, so manye Princes which haue fallen away from

our reasons, and woulde haue sene what might be saied with vs, what againste vs, and woulde not in his Bull whereby he lately pretended a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel, so rashely haue conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned so great a part of the worlde, so many learned and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, so manye common wealthes, so many kyngs, and so many Prynces, on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly vppon his owne blynd preiudices and foredeterminations, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them speak, or without shewing cause whye.</p>
            <p>But bycause he hath alredy so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs openlye, least by holdynge oure peace we should seme to graunt a fault, and specially bycause we can by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne haue audience in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publik assembly of the general Councel, wherein he would no creature should haue power to geue his voice or declare his opinion, excepte he were sworne and straightly bounde to maintaine his aucthoritie.</p>
            <p>For wee haue had good experience hereof in his last conference at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
<pb facs="tcp:1189:15"/>
at Trident, where the embassadours &amp; diuines of the Princes of Germany and of the free Cities were quite shutte out from their company: nother can we yet forget, how Iulius the third, aboue ten yeares past, prouided warely by his writt, that none of our sorte shoulde bee suffered to speake in the Councell (except there were som paraduenture y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wolde recante and chaunge his opinion). For this cause chieflye we thoughte it good to yelde vp an accoumpte of oure faith in writing, &amp; truely and openly to make aunswere to those things wherwith wee haue ben openly charged, to thende the worlde may see the partes and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacions of that doctrine, in the behalfe whereof so many good men haue litle regarded their oune lyues. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al men may vnderstand what manner of people they be, and what opinion they haue of God and of Religion, whome the Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome before they were called to tell theire tale, hath condemned for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,
<pb facs="tcp:1189:15"/>
without any good consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without any exaumple, &amp; vtterly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lawe or righte, onelye bycause he hearde tell that they did dissente from hym and his in som pointe of Religion.</p>
            <p>And although S.

Wee neede none of these shyftes which do maintaine the truthe.</p>
            <p>Further, yf wee do shewe it plaine that Gods holie Gospell, the aunciente Byshops and the primatiue Churche do make on our syde, and that wee haue
<pb facs="tcp:1189:16"/>
not without iust cause left these men, and rather haue retourned to the Apostles and oulde catholique Fathers. And yf wee shall be founde to doe the same not coulorably or craftely, but in good faith, before God, truly, honestly, cleerely and plainly: and yf they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For where they call vs Heretikes,
<pb facs="tcp:1189:16"/>
it is a crime so haynous, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> onles it may be seene, vnles it may be felt, &amp; in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner may be holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with hands and fingers, it ought not lightly to be iudged or bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued when it is <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Furthermore that there be dyuerse degrees of ministers in the church, wher of some be deacons, some preestes, some Byshops, to whom is committed the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to instruct the people, and the whole charge and settinge furth of Religion: yet not withstanding we say that there neither is nor can be any one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which may haue the whole superioritie in this vniuersall state, for that Christe is euer present to assist his Church, and nedeth not any man to supply his roome, as his

any custom ought to be hard, no though Paule his owne selfe or an Aungell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen shoulde come and teache the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
            <p>Moreouer we alow the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the Churche, that is to saye certaine holy signes &amp; ceremonies whiche Christ woulde wee should vse, that by them he might set before our eyes the mysteries of our saluation, and might more stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely confirme our faith which we haue in his bloud, and might seale his grace in our heartes. And those sacramentes togither with Tertullian, Origene, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, Augustin, Hierome, Chrysostome, Basill, Dionysius, and other Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Fathers do we call figures, signes, markes or badges, printes, copies, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, seales, signettes, similitudes, pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, representations, remembraunces, and memories. And we make no doubt togither with the same Doctours to say, that those be certaine visible wordes, seales of righteousnes, tokens of grace:
<pb facs="tcp:1189:28"/>
and do expresly pronounce, that in the Lords supper, there is truelye geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the beleuing, the body and bloud of the Lord, the flesshe of the sonne of God, whiche quickeneth our soules, the meate that cometh from aboue, the foode of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, grace, truth, and lyfe.

            <p>Besides wee acknowledge there be two sacramentes, which wee iudge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prely ought to be called by this name, that is to saye Baptisme, and the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of thankes giuing. For thus many we see were deliuered and sanctified by Christ, and well allowed of the oulde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Ambrose and Augustine. We say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Babtisme is a sacrament of the remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes, and of that washing which we
<pb facs="tcp:1189:29"/>
haue in the blood of Christe, and that no perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wil professe Christes name, oughte to bee restraigned or kepte backe therefrom: no not the very babes of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, forsomuche as they be borne in sinne, and do pertaine vnto the people of God. We say that <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the lorde, is a sacramente, that is to wytte, an euident token of the body and blood of Christe: wherein is set as it were before our eyes, the death of Christ and his resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and what act so euer he did whilest he was in his mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to thende we may giue hym thankes for his deathe, and for our deliueraunce. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by the often receauinge of this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente, wee may daily renewe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of that matter, to thintent we being fedd with the body and blood of Christ, may be brought into the hope of the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and of euerlasting life, and may moste assuredly beleue, that the bodye and blood of Christe dothe in like manner feede our soules, as breade and

For this cause yf there had ben a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which would be but a looker on, and abstaine from the holy Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, him did the old fathers &amp; Byshops of Rome in the primatiue Church,<note place="margin">

And that by his bloud al our spottes of sinne be washed cleane: That he hath pacified and set at one all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by the bloud of his Crosse: That he by the same one onely Sacrifice whiche he once offered vppon the Crosse, hath brought to effect and fulfilled al things, and that for that cause he sayd when he gaue vp the Ghoste, It is finished<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as though he woulde signifie that the price and ransome was nowe full payde for

            <p>But Hosius will here make exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion saieng, we do him wrong, and that these be not his owne wordes, but the words of the heretique Zwenkfeldius. But how than, yf Zwenkfeldius make exclamation on the other syde, and saye that the same very wordes be not his but Hosius owne wordes? For tell me where hath Zwenkfeldius euer writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee Or yf he haue writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, &amp; Hosius haue iudged the same to be wicked, why hath not Hosius spoken somuch as one worde to confute them? Howsoeuer the mater goeth, although Hosius paradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wil not allowe of those wordes, yet he doth not disallow the meaning of the
<pb facs="tcp:1189:74"/>
wordes. For wel nere in all controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, and namely touching the vse of the holy communion vnder both kindes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the wordes of Christ be plaine and euident, yet doth Hosius disdaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reiect them, as no better then colde and dead elementes: and commaundeth to giue faith to certaine new lessons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Church, &amp; to I wot not what reuelations of the holye Ghoste. And Pighius saieth, men ought not to beleue, no not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most cleare and manifest wordes of the scriptures, onles the same be allowed for good by the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and auctoritie of the churche.</p>
            <p>And yet as though this were to litle, they also burne the holye scriptures, as in times paste wicked kyng Aza dyd, or as Antiochus, or Maximinus did, and are wont to name the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Heretiques boks.

            <p>As for vs, we runne not for succour to the fyer as these mennes guyse is, but we runne to the scriptures: neyther doe we reason with the sworde, but with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God: and therewith as saythe Tertullian, do we feed our fayth: by it do we styr vp our hope, and strengthen our confidence.

And as Paule warneth vs, wee do not heare, no not an Aungel of God coming from hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen, yf he go about to pull vs from any parte of this doctrine.

            <p>

Chrysostom saith, there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oftentymes whiche boast themselues of the holye Ghoste: but truelye who so speake of their owne head, doe falselye boast they haue the spirite of God. For like as, saith he, Christ denied he spake of him selfe when he spake out of the lawe and Prophets, euen so now, yf any thing be preassed vpon vs in the name of the holy Ghoste saue the Gospell, we ought not to beleue it.

            <p>But how if the thinges whiche these men are so desirous to haue seeme newe, be found of greatest antiquitie? Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, howe if all the thinges well nye, whiche they so greatly set out with the name of antiquitie, hauing been wel and throughly examined, be at length founde to be but new, and deuised of verye late? Southly to say, no man that had a true and right co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideracion, would think the Iewes lawes and cerimonies to be new for all Hammans accusation: for they were grauen in very auncient Tables of most antiquitie. And although many did take Christ to haue swarued from Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham &amp; the old fathers, &amp; to haue brought in a certaine newe religion in his owne name, yet aunswered hee them directly: Yf ye beleeued Moyses, ye woulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue mee also, for my doctrine is not so new as you make yt. For Moses an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of greatest antiquitie, and one to
<pb facs="tcp:1189:79"/>
whome ye geue al honor, hath spoken of me. Paule likewise, though the Gospell of Iesus Christe be of many counted to be but new, yet hath it (saith he) the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie most old, both of the law and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes. As for our doctrine whiche wee may rightlier cal Christes catholik doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, it is so farre of from newe, that God who is aboue all most auncient, &amp; the father of our Lorde Iesus Christe, hath left the same vnto vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospel, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets &amp; Apostles woorkes, beinge monuments of greatest age. So that no man can nowe thinke oure doctrine to be newe, onlesse the same thinke either the prophetes faithe, or the Gospell, or els Christe himselfe to be newe.</p>
            <p>And as for their religion, if it be of so longe continuance as thei woulde haue men weene it is, why doe they not proue it so by the exaumples of the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Churche, and by the Fathers and Councells of olde tymes?

lye reioyce on our owne behalfe. But yet for all this, from the primatiue Church, from the Apostles, and from Christ wee haue not departed, true it is. We were brought vp with these menne in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lack of knowledge of God, as Moses was taught vp in the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the bosome of the Egyptians. We haue ben of youre company saith Tertullian, I confesse it, and no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile at all, for saith he, menne be made and not borne Christians.

They wil say peraduenture, by cause the conductes of water, wher with out menne cannot commodiouslye liue, haue now failed and ar dried vp in those hilles. Well then, lett them giue vs lyke leaue inseeking the water of eternal lyfe, that they giue them selfes in seekyng the
<pb facs="tcp:1189:92"/>
water of the well, for the water verely fayled amongest them. Thelders of the Iewes sayth Ieremye, sent their litle ones to the waterings, and they finding no water, beyng in a miserable case and vtterly marred for thurst, brought home againe their vessells emptie. The nedye &amp; poore folke saith Esaye, sought about for water, but no wheare founde they any, their tonge was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withered with thirst. Euen so these menne haue broken in peeces al the pypes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duites, they haue stopped vp al the springs, &amp; choked vp the fountaine of liuyng water with durte and myre. And as Caligula many yeres past locked fast vp al the storehou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of corne in Rome, &amp; thereby brought a generall derth and famyne amongest the people, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so these men by damming vp all the fountaines of Goddes word, haue brought the people into a peetiful thirst.

<pb facs="tcp:1189:92"/>
nor the thurst of water, but of hearing the worde of God. With greate distresse went they scattering about, seeking some sparke of heauenly light to refresh their consciences withall, but that light was alredy thoroughly quenched out, so that they could finde none. This was a rue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful state. This was a lamentable forme of Goddes Churche. It was a miserie to liue therin without the Gospel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light, and without all comfort.</p>
            <p>Wherfore though our departing wer a trouble to them, yet ought they to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider withall, how iust cause wee had of our departure. For yf they wil saye, it is in no wise lawfull for one to leaue the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship wherein he hath be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought vp, they maye aswell in our names or vpon our heades condemne both the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, the Apostles, and Christ him selfe.

            <p>Now then synce it is manifest and out of all peraduenture, that these men are fallen from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Grekes, of whom they receiued the Gospell, of whome they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the faith, the true Religion and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mater why they will not now be called home again to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same men, as it were to their originals &amp; first founders?

            <p>Let them compare our Churches and theirs togither, and they shall see that themselues haue moste shamefully gon from the Apostles, and we moste iustely haue gon from them.

            <p>We affirme togither with the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers, that the body of Christe is not eaten but of the good and faithfull, and of those that are endued with the spirit of Christe.

and that the same plainelye was a iuste decree, whereby they pronounced that Christ was worthy to die. This me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth is straunge, that these men are not able to speake for themselues and defend their owne cause, but thei must also take parte with Annas and Caiphas. For yf they will call that a laufull and a good Councell, wherein the Sonne of God was moste shamfully condemned to dye, what Councell will they then alowe for false and naught?

<pb facs="tcp:1189:103"/>
There assembled many Byshoppes and Abbottes and others whom it behoued. For that matter they were alone by themselues, whatsoeuer they did no body gainesaid it: for they had quite shut out and barred oure syde from all manner of assemblies, and there they sat sixe yeares feedinge folkes with a meruelous expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their doings. The first sixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, as though it were greatly nedeful, they made many determinations of the holy Trinitie, of the Father, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Son, and of the holy Ghost, which were god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges in deede, but not so necessarye for that time. Let vs see in all that while of so many, so manifest, so often confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them &amp; so euident errours, what one errour haue they amended? from what kinde of idolatrie haue they reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the people? What superstition haue they taken away? What peece of their tyranny and pompe haue they dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed? as though all the worlde may not nowe see, that this is a Conspiracie and

not a Councell, and that these Byshopes whom the Pope hath now called to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be wholy sworne &amp; become bounde to beare him their faithfull allegiaunce, and wil do no manner of thing, but that they perceiue pleaseth him, and helpeth to aduaunce his power, and as hee will haue it: Or that they reckon not of the number of mennes voyces, rather then haue weight and consideracion of the same: Or that myght doth not often times ouercome the right.</p>
            <p>And therefore we knowe that diuers times many good men and Catholique Bysshops did tarry at home, and would not come when such Councels were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, wherein men so apparauntly labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to serue factions and to take partes, bicause they knewe they should but lose their trauaile and dooe no good, seeinge where vnto their enemies mindes were so wholye bent.

The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Iustinian made a law to correct the behauiour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cleargie, and to cutt shorte the insolencie of the priestes.

            <p>Lette vs see then, suche men as haue authoritie ouer the Bysshoppes, suche menne as receaue from God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes
<pb facs="tcp:1189:112"/>

Shall we say it perteineth not to suche men to haue to do with Religion? or shall wee saye, a Christian Magistrate whyche dealith amongest others in these maters doth either naughtelie, or presumpteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,

And what is hee that canne finde oute either more catholique princes or more notable exaumples?</p>
            <p>Wherefore yf it were lawfull for them to dooe thus beinge but Ciuile Magistrates, and hauinge the chiefe rule of common weales, what offence haue oure Princes at thys daye made, whiche maye not haue leaue to dooe the lyke, beinge in the like degree?

            <p>Well thus doinge, they wiselye and warelye prouide for them selues and for their kingedome, whiche otherwise they see is like shortly to come to naught. For if so be, they whom God hath placed in greatest dignitie, didde see and perceiue these mennes practises, howe Christes commaundementes be despised by them, how the light of the Gospell is darkened and quenched out by them, &amp; how them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues also be subtilly begiled and mocked and vnwares be deluded by them, &amp; the way to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingedom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stopped vp before them, no doubt they would neuer so quietlye suffer them selues neyther to be disdaigned after suche a prowde sorte, nor so dispitefully to be scorned and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them.

Neyther had we euer intended to do it, except both the manifeste and most assured will of God opened to vs in his holy scriptures, and the regarde of our owne saluation had euen constreyned vs there vnto. For though wee haue departed from that Churche which these menne call catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and by that meanes gett vs enuy amongest them that want skill to iudge, yet is this ynough for vs, and it ought to be ynough for euery wise and good man, and one that maketh accoumpte of euerlasting lyfe, that we haue gon from that Church whiche had power to erre, whiche Christ, who cannot erre, tolde so long before it should erre, and which we our selues did euidently see with our eyes to haue gon both from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Fathers and from the Apostles, and from Christ

            <p>And as we knowe both Christe hym selfe and all good men here to fore haue don, we haue called home againe to the originall and first foundation that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which hath ben fowly forslowed &amp; vtterly corrupted by these men. For wee thought it mere thence to take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paterne of reforminge Religion, from whence the ground of Religion was first taken, Bycause this one reasone, as saythe the most auncient Father Tertullian, hath

Likewise al the good and commendable Princes mentioned of in the Scriptures, were praised, specially by those wordes that they had walked in the wayes of their Father Dauid.

            <p>Butte by your fauoure, some will saye, These thinges ought not to haue been attempted without the Bysshoppe of Romes commaundement, forsomuche as hee onely is the knotte and bande of Christian societie: he onely is that priest of Leuies order, whom God signified in the Deuteronomy, from whom counsell

in matters of weight and true iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ought to be fetched, and who so obeyeth not his iudgement, the same man ought to bee killed in the sight of his brethren: and that no mortall creature hathe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to bee iudge ouer him whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee dooe: that Christe reigneth in heauen and hee in earthe: that hee alone canne dooe as muche as Christe, or God hym selfe canne dooe, bicause Christ and hee haue but one Councell house: That without him is no faythe, no hope, no churche, and who so goeth from him, quite casteth awaye and renounceth his owne saluation.

            <p>As for vs truely, we haue fallen from the Byshoppe of Rome vpon no maner of worldlye respect or commoditie, and woulde to Christe hee so behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

as this falling away neded not: but so the case stoode, that oules we left him, wee could not come to Christ.

            <p>For wheras som vse to make so great a vaunte, that the Pope is onely Peters Successour, as though therby he carried the holy Ghost in his bosome &amp; cannot erre, this is but a matter of nothing and a very trieflyng tale.

            <p>Or contrarie wise paraduenture they had rather saye thus, that the Pope doth now all the same thinges whyche wee knowe Peter did many a daye a goe: that is, that he rounneth vp and downe into euerye Countreye to Preache the Gospell, not onelye openlye abroad, but also priuatelye from house to house: that hee is diligente, and applyeth that busines in seasone and out of seasone, in dewe tyme, out of dew time: that he doth the part of an Euangelist, that he fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the worke and ministerie of Christ, that he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> watcheman of the house of Israel: receaueth answeares and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des at Goddes mouth: and euen as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receiueth them, so deliuereth them ouer

For our Kynges, yea euen they whiche with greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence dyd folow and obey the auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and faith of the Byshops of Rome, haue long synce founde and felte well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the yoke &amp; tyrannye of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes kingdome. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Byshops of Rome toke the Crowne of from the head of our Kynge Henrye the second, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to put a side all maiestie, and lyke a meere priuate man to come vnto their Legate with great submission and humilitie, so as all his subjectes might
<pb facs="tcp:1189:126"/>
laugh him to scorne. More the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, they caused Byshops and Monkes and some parte of the nobilitie to be in the feelde a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst our Kynge Iohn, and sett all the people at libertie from their othe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ought allegeaunce to their king: and at last, wickedly and most abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablie they bereaued the kyng not onely of his kyngdome, but also of his lyfe. Besides this, they excommunicated and cursed Kyng Henry theight, the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Prince, &amp; stirred vp against him sometime the Emperour, sometime the Frenche Kyng, &amp; as muche as in them was, putte in aduenture our Realme to haue ben a very praye and spoyle. Yet were they but foules and mad, to thinke that eyther so mighty a Prince could be scared with bugges and rattles: or els y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> so noble and great a kyngdome myght so easily, euen at one morsel be deuoured and swalowed vp.</p>
            <p>And yet as though all this were to litle, they would nedes make all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme
<pb facs="tcp:1189:126"/>
tributarie to them, &amp; exacted there yearely most vniust and wrongfull ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes. So deere cost vs the freendeshyp of the Citie of Rome. Wherefore yf they haue gotten these thinges of vs by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion thorough their fraude and suttle sleightes, we see no reason why we may not plucke awaye the same from them againe by laufull wayes &amp; iust means. And yf out kynges in that darknes and blindenes of former tymes gaue them these thinges of their owne accorde and liberalitie for Religion sake, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a certaine opinion of their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned holines, now when ignoraunce &amp; errour is spied out, may the Kinges their successours take them awaye againe, seing they haue the same auctoritie, the Kinges their auncestours had before. For the gyft is voide, except it be alowed by the will of the giuer: and that cannot seme a perfit will, which is dymmed and hindered by errour.</p>
            <p>Thus ye see good Christian Reader,
<pb facs="tcp:1189:127"/>
howe it is no new thing, though at this day the religion of Christ be enterteined with dispites and checkes, being but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely restored and as it were comming vp againe a new, for somuche as the lyke hath chaunced both to Christ hym selfe and to his Apostles: yet neuerthelesse for feare ye maye suffer your selfe to be led amysse and seduced with those exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Aduersaries, we haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at large vnto you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our Religion, what our opinion is of God the Father, of his onely sonne Iesus Christ, of the holy Ghost, of the Church, of the Sacramentes, of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures, of ceremonies, and of euery parte of Christian beleue. Wee haue sayde that wee abandon and detest as plagues and poysons all those oide? Heresies, whiche eyther the sacred Scriptures or the auncient Councelles haue vtterly condemned: that wee call home againe asmuche as euer wee can, the right Discipline of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, which
<pb facs="tcp:1189:127"/>
our Aduersaries haue quite brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a poore &amp; weake case: That we pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe all licentiousnes of lyfe and vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes of maners by the olde and long continued laws, and with asmuch shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penes as is conuenient and lyeth in our power: That we mainteine still the state of kingdomes, in the same condition and plight wherin we haue found the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diminishing or alteration, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge vnto our Princes their maiestie and worldly preeminence safe and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out empayring, to our possible power: That we haue so gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our selues away from that Church which they had made a denne of Theeues, and wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was in good frame or once like to the Churche of God, and whiche them selfes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed had erred many weies, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Lott in times paste gat hym out of Sodom, or Abraham out of Caldie, not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a desire of contention, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of God him selfe: And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue searched out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Bible whiche we are sure cannot deceiue, one sure fourme
<pb facs="tcp:1189:128"/>
of Religion, and haue retorned againe vnto the Primatiue Churche of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers and Apostles, that is to say, to the first ground and beginning of thinges, as vnto the very foundations &amp; head springes of Christes church. And in very troth we haue not carried for in this matter the auctoritie or consent of the Trident Councell, wherein we sawe nothing don vprightly nor by good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre: where also euery body was sworne to the maintenaunce of one man: where our Princes Embassadours were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned: where not one of oure diuines could be heard, and where partes taking and ambition was openly and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye procured and wrought, but as the holy Fathers in former time, and as our predecessours haue commonly don, wee haue restored our Churches by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall Conuocation, and haue cleane shaken of as our dewtie was, the yoke and tyrannye of the Byshop of Rome, to whome we were not bounde, who also
<pb facs="tcp:1189:128"/>
had no manner of thying lyke neyther to Christ nor to Peter, nor to an Apostle, nor yet like to any Byshopp at all. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, we saye that wee agree amongest our selues, touching the whole iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and chiefe substaunce of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and with one mouth and with one spirite do woorshipp God and the Father of our Lord Iesu Christ.</p>
            <p>Wherefore O Christian and godlye Reader, forsomuche as thow seest the reasons and causes both whye wee haue restored Religion, and whye wee haue forsaken these men, thou oughtest not to maruaile, though wee haue chosen to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beye our Maister Christe rather then menne. Paule hath giuen vs warning how we shoulde not suffer our selues to be carried away with suche sundry lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, and to fly their companies, in es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall whiche woulde sowe debate and variaunces, cleane contrarie to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine whithe they had receiued of Christ and the Apostls. Longe synce haue these
<pb facs="tcp:1189:129"/>
mennes craftes and treacheries decaied and vanished and fled away at the sight and light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospell, euen as the owle doth at the sunne rysing. And albeit their trumperye be builte vp and reared as highe as the Skye, yet euen in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and as yt were of the owne selue fallyth yt downe againe to the ground, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to naught. For you must not think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al these things haue com to passe rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or at adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture: It hath ben gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> against al mennes willes wel nye, the Gospell of Iesu Christe shoulde be spread abroad thorough out the whole worlde, at these dayes. And therfore men folowing godds biddings, haue of their owne free will resorted vnto the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Iesus Christ. And for our parts truely wee haue sought hereby neyther glorie nor welthe, nor pleasure nor ease. For there is plentie of all these thinges with our aduersaryes. And when wee wer of their side, we enioyed such world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye commodyties muche more liberallie
<pb facs="tcp:1189:129"/>
and bountefullye, then wee doe nowe. Neyther doe wee eschew concorde and peace, but to haue peace with man, wee will not be at warre with God. The name of peace is a swete and pleasaunte thinge, saith Hilarius: But yet beware, sayth he, peace is one thinge, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is an other. For yf it shoulde so be as they seeke to haue it, that Christe shoulde be commaunded to keepe silence, that the truth of the Gospell should be betraied, that horrible errours should be cloked, that Christian mennes eyes shold be bleared, &amp; that they might be suffred to conspire openlye against God: this were not a peace, but a moste vngodlye couenaunt of seruitude. There is a peace saith Nazianzene, that is vnprofitable: againe there is a discorde saith he, that is profitable. For we muste conditionallye desire peace, so farre as is laufull before God, &amp; so farre as we may conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. For otherwise Christ him self broughte not peace into the worlde, but a sworde.

The Pope hym selfe maketh greate complaynere at this present, that Charitie in people is waxen coulde. And why so trow ye? Forsooth because his profittes decaye more and more.
