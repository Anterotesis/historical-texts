         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, he afterwards did indeavour with a high

by ſetting up his Standard, and waging open warre
upon the Parliament, and againſt all his good and loyall
Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:117431:6"/>

the precious lives of very many, together with the rapines
and ruines of millions of people, in theſe three Nations.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, for that the King deſpiſing good and faithfull
counſell, when ſeaſonably given him by the Parliament,
of whom he ought to have received it; wholly adhered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
animated and followed, perverſe, fooliſh, ſlanderous,
wicked, proud, malitious, haughty, deceitfull, and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
mens counſell, who endeavoured utterly to root out,
extirpate, and extinguiſh the very name and being of all
thoſe who were the faithfull of the Land, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a thorow Reformation; of all wicked and unrighteous
practiſes in the King, his family and Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, by betraying his Subjects into the Enemies
hands abroad (to wit) in the Iſle of <hi>Hee,</hi> and in neglecting
to relieve his Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt thoſe moſt barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

            <p>Eightly, for that the King with all his trayterous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
did continue to reſiſt the Parliament and this Army
raiſed by their Power and Authority, for the defence of this
Nation, untill they had ſubdued them, and made the King
their conquered Priſoner, after which time he ceaſed not
to perſiſt in his former deſignes.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, by his tranſgreſſing tranſcendently, more than
<hi>Saul</hi> did, for he onely ſpared Gods enemies, for which
his Kingdome was taken from him,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 15.</note> and given unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi>
but our <hi>Saul</hi> deſtroyed the Lords deareſt friends,<note place="margin">Exod. 4. 22. &amp; 19. 5.</note> his

            </p>
            <p>Now, foraſmuch as the Powers that be, are ordained (or
ordered) of God, and God hath ſo ordered it, that this
Army, contrary to the endeavours, ſtrivings, and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Enemies multiplied plots and practiſes, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

ſo ordered all, that this Army ſhould prevaile againſt all,

hath ſet up in the Parliament: through the ſides of the

            <p>That it is well knowne,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the firſt grounds and principles
of the Parliament were for <hi>Salus Populi;</hi> and it had beene
well if you your ſelves, and every Member of the Houſe
alſo, had not declined, but acted upon that principle ever
ſince: And although I grant you, <hi>The Kings practiſes upon
the Parliament was an high violation to their Priviledges, and an act
ſo injurious and deſtructive to the good of the Kingdome.</hi> Yet I
anſwer:</p>
            <p>It was but while the Parliament, and thoſe five Members

deſired the King rather than the ſafety of the People,
by whom they were intruſted for the good of this Nation.

as you have inferred, and for that the foreſaid members were
not ſeized upon, when they were aſſembled in the houſe,
but without doores, and for acting, againſt the ſafety of
the people. And without that, that the Parliament is not
now free, and full, and as really, as <hi>when the King would have

            <p>You have not conſidered that the King did ſince that

if God have made you proſper while you were in his way, this can

            <p>This is one of your former pretences,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> multiplied by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,

I ſhall by Scripture and reaſon, prove, that the Generall

may expect ſucceſſe, and a bleſſing from God therein.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the Generall and his Councell, do, and have
performed their duty, in al their proceedings, concurring with
the Parliament, to execute juſtice upon the grand Delinquent,
and alſo upon ſome of the chiefe of his <note n="*" place="margin">Stiled Parliam. Decl. 20 May, 1642.</note> wicked Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
and adherents</p>
            <p>Secondly, for that the King, their conquered and captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Priſoner, by the rule, <hi>Lex talionis,</hi> ought to be done unto
as he did unto others;<note place="margin">Iudg. 5. 6, 7.</note> and this <hi>Adoni-bezek,</hi> a Heathen King,

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, in that the King with al his Heathen Adherents,
took counſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted,
ſaying,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Let us breake their bonds in ſunder, and caſt their

not then a ſtrong tye of holy writ, upon our Parliament and
Army to proſecute, and execute Judgement, not only upon the
head Malignant, the King, but alſo upon others, the heads of his
wicked adherents, although none others, have been ſo exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
before them?</p>
            <p>Fourthly for that the King did uſe falſe dealing, in pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

contriver, of the firſt blood-ſhed? And did he not perſiſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
multitudes of his moſt faithfull peoples lives and eſtates,
many yeares together? and can wee thinke God hath forgot

            <p>Fifthly, for that it was the Parliament and Armies duty,
when God had delivered the King into their hands, and left
him at their diſpoſe,<note n="*" place="margin">Pſa. 14. 9.</note> to execute judgement upon him, and
to ſecure themſelves and the People, who have alwaies ſtuck
cloſe unto them, in their greateſt diſtreſſes? hath not the King
been a corrupt fountaine, poyſoning every ſtreame and rivolet
he had acceſſe unto? and would he not have done ſo ſtill, if
he had not been cut off? and is not juſtice executed, a good
meanes to eſtabliſh the faithfull of the Land, in reſt and peace,
with their lives, Eſtates, Lawes, Liberties, and Priviledges, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
and inherently in themſelves? and have they not with

not <hi>Jephthah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> do ſo, with that which was the <hi>Amorites</hi>
by originall right? they onely won it by the ſword, and did
weare it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, did not the eminency of the Kings perſon, agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, hath not the Parliament the Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

that the Generall and his Councell, are now in Gods way,

the Lords wrath againſt your ſelves, by oppoſing of

unto all your ſins, to ask you ſuch a King to rule over you, one
who was corrupted, ſtained, and rejected of God, in point of
Government, and not without blemiſh, as <hi>Saul</hi> was, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
