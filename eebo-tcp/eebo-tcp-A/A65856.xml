            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Impartial and Friendly READER;</head>
            <argument>
               <p>A few Advertisements relating to <hi>John Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyman</hi>'s Book, styled, <hi>The Quakers Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask't;</hi> wherein the Reader is desired to Observe,</p>
            </argument>
            <p>FIrst, That the said Book was sent in Manuscript to some of Us, in the year, 1677. except some Words and Passages since added, and others omitted in the Printed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> That this Ensuing Treatise in Answer, was quickly writ in the same year, 1677. and kept private for many years, as 'tis said (in a written Note) his has been, with an Intent to publish this Answer in Print, if <hi>I. P's</hi> Envy should prompt him so to publish his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> Liberty of Conscience being established by Law, this is placed upon his Book in writing, as the reason of its now Publication. Which looks as if he envied our present
<pb facs="tcp:58894:3"/>
Liberty by his pernicious Book, tending to bring Persecution again upon us, by rendring us obnoxious to the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as much as in him lyes. But we thank God we enjoy the Liberty we have by Law, and that we have cause to hope the Government will not be so credulous of such odious Invectives against Us, as to be influenced thereby to lessen our Christian Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Note that this Ensuing Treatise being first writ in the year, 1677. those Passages in it relating to our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings then, as placed in the <hi>Present Tence,</hi> relate to that time, and not to this now, wherein it is Printed: Wherein we now enjoy our Religious Meetings peaceably and free from Persecution, for which we truly bless God, and thank our Superiors in the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> Please to observe, that <hi>I. P.</hi> in his said Printed Book explains [<hi>the Quakers</hi>] by <hi>viz.</hi> [George Fox <hi>and his Party</hi>] and instead of <hi>I. P</hi>'s. words in his Manuscript [<hi>this pretended change of Judgment in the Men that are Quakers, is not to be taken for a change of Judgment in the Quakers.</hi>] He hath it thus in Print, p. 6. <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>This pretended change of Judgment in</hi> G. Fox <hi>and his Preachers, is not to be taken for a change of their Judgment</hi>] which is still to bring an Odium upon Us, and tending unjustly to render Us obnoxious and offensive to the Civil Government, contrary to our Christian Testimony and peaceable Living.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> Instead of his own proper Name [<hi>John Pennyman</hi>] which is set three times over in his Manuscript, he hath, [<hi>by Philo Aletheia</hi>] in his Title Page in Print; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>P. I.</hi> five times over in Print; which 2 Letters of his name <hi>are transposed,</hi> as <hi>he understands, p.</hi> 13. which with the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Book seems to be placed not upon himself, but upon another Person <hi>I. G.</hi> So that <hi>John</hi> appears more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than innocent in this point: He has his Publisher and Transposer of the two Letters of his Name, either to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the fact, or for some cover or subterfuge for himself;
<pb facs="tcp:58894:3"/>
he has travelled in pain to bring forth such a monstrous false birth, and accepted of another Persons Aid to Midwife it into the World, for mischief and causeless Revenge. It seems when his Book was printed, he had lost some of his Confidence and Zeal for his work, or at least some of his Friends had not so much for him as he seem'd to have when he first writ it, in thus varying his Name in his Title Page and Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concerning some Passages added in his printed Book,</hi> p. 10. about <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> his Insinuation from a Book, titled, <hi>West answering the North.</hi> Where he saith, <hi>I am unwilling to write out, because I am not willing to expose you.</hi> To this <hi>I. P.</hi> unjustly cites only a small part of <hi>G. W</hi>'s Reply.—Thus (<hi>in his serious search</hi>) <q>I cannot but observe the Man's Dissimulation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this implicite kind of accusing us to render us more suspicious and obnoxious, than if he had dealt plainly.</q> And then <hi>I. P.</hi> takes upon him to deal more plainly, by reciting and observing some Passages out of the said Book, <hi>West answering the North.</hi> As observing (as he saith) <hi>with what strange kind of Confidence, deluding and blinding our Proselites, not daring to do so before Authority, but rather down upon his Knees and beg Pardon for his Auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness and Insolence, Fallacious doings,</hi> &amp;c. this against G. W. To all which we may truly say, that we have cause to thank God we have more just and impartial Men in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and more just Judges than <hi>J. P.</hi> for he has dealt very unjustly and maliciously by <hi>G. W.</hi> in this matter, as if he either spoke slightingly or assented to all those sayings cited out of <hi>West answering the North.</hi> Whereas the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is apparently manifest in <hi>G. W</hi>'s. very following words, in his serious search, <hi>p.</hi> 37. After the words cited <hi>viz.</hi> hereby to render <q>us <hi>more suspicious</hi> and <hi>obnoxious than if he had dealt plainly.</hi>
               </q> J. P. unjustly leaves out these following words [which are explanatory to the matter,
<pb facs="tcp:58894:4"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi>] <q>especially whilst he accuseth us over and over with <hi>Justifying the late Wars against the King,</hi> when as that very Book quoted by him, entituled, <hi>The West answering to the North,</hi> Printed 1657. doth in the whole Tenour of it severely reprehend those in Power, to wit, <hi>Oliver</hi> and his Ministers, for their Oppressions, Cruelties and Arbitrary Proceedings, which they pretended to condemn in those before them, though there might be some words too harsh in the said Book as reflecting backward, but with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to judge them then in Power: Yet it is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as chiefly writ by two Officers or Captains of the old Army, being Common-wealths Men (as I understand) who had not as then wholly got over the Warring Spirit, however did simpathise with our Poor, Innocent Friends, when they beheld their deep Sufferings, as in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree sharing with them, though it's probable some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their former sharpness of Spirit was left, wherein they had been animated by such zealous Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains as <hi>Jeremy;</hi> yet those Books quoted by him were extant long before the King's Pardon, which he pretends so greatly to respect.</q> It appears that these Passages ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to clear us, our Adversary designedly left out, the more to recriminate and abuse us. In <hi>p.</hi> 12. he cites a Passage out of <hi>E. B</hi>'s. Works, <hi>p.</hi> 442. <q>
                  <hi>That all Governours and Rulers ought to be accountable to the People and to the next succeeding Rulers, upon occasion; and that the chiefest of the Rulers be subject under the Law, and punishable by it if they be Transgressors,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt when our Adversary writ this, he thought he had a great advantage against the People called Quakers; but he argues nothing, nor infers any thing from the words. If his Intention thereby was (pursuant to his general charge against us) to render us guilty of <hi>double Dealing, false Heartedness and Temporizing,</hi> this Passage cited by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:58894:4"/>
us proves no such thing, but is a plain Indication to the contrary; or if it was to render us obnoxious, he hath missed his End. It plainly concerns such Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments as were <hi>Elective,</hi> as <hi>E. B.</hi> his precedent words (<hi>for choosing them by the Consent of the People</hi>) do plainly intimate, (and it was first writ in the Days of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth-Government.) And for Rulers (or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives) that are <hi>chosen,</hi> being <hi>accountable to the next suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Rulers, if there be Cause,</hi> what has he against the matter it self? What could be <hi>J. P</hi>'s <hi>Design in this Citation before, without Observation or Remark</hi> upon it? If he tells us plainly, and make his Objection, I think it will be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter then to answer him, both on a Religious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and <hi>secundum Hominem,</hi> which at present I find no necessity for.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Reader,</hi> we find much of the same Stuff and envious Quarrels raked up against us in divers other Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets as are in <hi>John Pennyman</hi>'s Book, particularly in <hi>Fr. Bugg,</hi> another Apostate, his Pamphlets, though not so largely as in <hi>J. P</hi>'s, but as malicious, which are elswhere answered.</p>
            <p>In p. 13. he again charges us <hi>with baseness and temporizing, and having out-done and even surpassed the Deeds of the Wicked, that he says he is stopt, for Words are too short to manifest us,</hi> (he saith). Whereby it seems he wants Words bad enough for us, in so much that he is stopt (he saith): But how is he stopt? Does his Envy and Malice rise up to his Throat, and like to choak him? He has given us Language and Words hard and bad enough to render us as Infamous as he can, as charging us with <hi>such Wickedness as can hardly be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld, and as great Dissemblers, Deceivers and Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as have appeared in our Age, Lyers, false Prophets; Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi> &amp;c. But now he wants Words to manifest us. The Railery he has belched out has not manifested us; can
<pb facs="tcp:58894:5"/>
he not study and invent some worse and harder Language against us? However, he is far louder in his Clamour and Revilings than in his Proofs.</p>
            <p>In p. 13. he reflects upon a Book, entituled, <hi>Truth's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Professors, for laying open the Addresses and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which others had made to</hi> O. C. <hi>and</hi> R. C. <hi>with long Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions thereupon;</hi> which he falsly saith, <hi>was to stir up the Powers against them,</hi> charging <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Friends, <hi>as having been most highly guilty themselves of those very things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein he hath also dealt very unfairly and unjustly; we do not believe there was any such Design in <hi>W. C's</hi> setting out that Character as either to defame others, or to stir up the Powers against other Professors, but that it was to shew their Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their manifold Flatteries and Temporiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their superlative Characters, Applauses and Addresses, which he cannot parallel from our Friends Applications ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then or since.</p>
            <p>In p. 14. our Adversary again deals very unfairly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly by <hi>G. W.</hi> about some of our Friends, saying, They give forth Writings from the Immediate Eternal Spirit of God, and by the same Spirit and Power that was in the Prophets, Christ and Apostles; unto which he falsly addeth, <hi>viz. And their so speaking</hi> (<hi>G. W.</hi> saith) <hi>is of as great Authority as the Scriptures and Chapters are, and greater.</hi> His Words, [<hi>and their so speaking</hi>] are <hi>J. P.</hi> his own Abuse and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; where did ever <hi>G. W.</hi> say, That the Quakers, <hi>so speaking of</hi> their own Books and Writings, is of such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? He denies the Comparison and Charge, as stated; and I, the person concerned, do solemnly declare, It was never in my Heart, Judgment or Intention to undervalue the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament; but to esteem them not only as given by Divine Inspiration, and to prefer them before all other Books and Writings extant
<pb facs="tcp:58894:5"/>
in the whole World. <hi>J. P.</hi> injuriously mistates the Case, and leaves out the explanatory part of <hi>G. W's</hi> Answer in that Case; and <hi>J. P.</hi> has been better informed therein, than now he represents it. Therefore Impartial Reader, please to take our Answer in this Case, as it is laid down in our Book, Entituled, <hi>the Christianity of the People called Quakers Vindicated,</hi> p. 13. <q>We always confess the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by Divine Inspiration, and prefer them before and above all other Writings or Books, and in no wise question the Truth of them; yet we must needs allow the Holy Spirit (from whence they came) the Preference, and its immediate Teaching and Speaking in the Soul, as of greater Efficacy, Power and Authority to that Soul, than the bare Writing or Scripture without, or only Reading thereof, though it contain the same Words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately taught. And so Christ and his Apostles li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and powerful Preaching in and from the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motion of the Holy Spirit, as being of greater Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Power and Authority, than the outward Writing or Scripture it self, simply or abstractly considered, as distinct from that Spirit, though the words preached and the words written may be the same: For the Gospel as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly preached, <hi>came not in Words only, but also in Power, and in the Holy Ghost,</hi> 1 Thess. 1. 5. For the real Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Efficacy and Service, the Holy Scripture has upon a Soul, is from the Holy Spirit or word of Life, giving the true belief and right understanding thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again our Adversary proceeds to give Judgment and Sentence against us, as <hi>helping forward our own Destruction,</hi> and presumptuously addeth these words; <hi>and seeing there is no hopes of their Repentance or Forbearance (all other ways or means that have been used proving ineffectual) It's now thought meet thus to expose them,</hi> &amp;c. p. 14. Thus he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb facs="tcp:58894:6"/>
to give Sentence upon us, and to justifie his manner of exposing of us, and Printing his Invective against the People called Quakers.</p>
            <p>His Self-contradiction is notorious, where in <hi>p.</hi> 15. he saith, <hi>I abhor that Practice, that is, to render us obnoxious to the Government,</hi> when but in the Page before, he concludes that <hi>there being no hopes of our Repentance, it's now thought meet thus to expose us</hi> (as he has done) though he seems to extenuate his own Fact and Concern therein, by placing the Publishing and Printing of it upon another Person. Now he is for exposing and doing what mischief he can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, having presumptuously given Sentence of our Destruction, positively concluding, <hi>that there is no hopes of our Repentance.</hi> The Lord rebuke the Insolency, Pride, Presumption and Envy of this gain-saying <hi>Luciferian</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For what end does <hi>John Pennyman</hi> come so often into our Meetings, to Preach and make a noise among us, smite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reflecting upon the Testimonies of the Servants of Christ, exalting himself as Judge over all? What can his end be therein? It cannot be to Preach us unto Repentance, which he has already judged there is no hopes of; neither can We and our Friends receive him as either Prophet or Minister of Christ, though he intrudes himself as into the place of such an one, or at least as if he would have People believe that he had some special Commission: But he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears so very empty dry and dead, that the least Child of Light doth see him, and his forced presumptuous Messages to be both void of Life and Charity, as well as of Faith and Hope; having no Hope of their Repentance to whom he Preaches. He hath told us, <hi>the Righteous are as bold as a</hi> Lyon; but where was his Boldness in the times of our late Sufferings and Persecutions when the Informers were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad? He came not then to Preach, Prophesie, or reprove among us; he would then rather keep obscure, than forfeit
<pb facs="tcp:58894:6"/>
his 20 or 40 <hi>l.</hi> for Preaching in our publick Meetings. To whom I conclude, Oh <hi>John!</hi> mayst thou yet be humbled unto Repentance: Mayst thou yet find a place of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for thy great Envy, and all thy hard Speeches against the Lords Servants and People: My Soul yet desires thy Repentance, if a place be yet to be found, that thy Gray Hairs may not go down to the Grave in Sorrow and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; thy days are hastning towards a Period, recollect thy Self and consider thy ways, and the evil and mischief thou hast attempted and done against the Lord's Heritage and Servants, not only against the Living, but also against the Dead, who are at rest in Christ: The Lord open thine Eyes and hasten thee to seek Repentance, if it may stand with his good Pleasure, otherwise thy Destruction hastens: Remember and think of it.</p>

               </salute>

            <p>SInce that thou madest Enquiry of me concerning the Book in Manuscript, entituled, <hi>The Quakers Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked,</hi> &amp;c. what we thought to do in it.</p>
            <p>This is to acquaint thee, That though such kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies are not desirable nor pleasant to me, any more than to thy self, whom I know to be a Man of a peaceable Spirit; and unwilling, as well as I, that the Religion of us and all Conscientious Dissenters should be exposed to open Contempt by such Controversies, and raking up Occasions: Yet upon a serious and strict Examination of the said Book, with the principal Quotations, Observations and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentative Passages; I, with some others, have been
<pb facs="tcp:58894:7"/>
stirred up and enabled by the Lord, out of a Holy Zeal for his Truth and People, and from a Necessity laid upon us, to draw up and compose an Answer to the said Book. <hi>First,</hi> To reprehend his Envy and Malice: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> To vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate our Innocency towards the Government, and Consistency of our Addresses to the King, with our Principle and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as a People from the beginning. And for thy Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take the following Account and General Notes of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and Sense in this Matter, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we have an Answer in Manuscript, already prepared, to <hi>John Pennyman's</hi> late Book in Manuscript, not willing to publish it until he first give us occasion, by publishing his; and that therein we have by sufficient Demonstration proved him guilty of apparent Lyes. <hi>I.</hi> In the general Charge against the People called Quakers. <hi>II.</hi> Against Particulars; as also of most gross Hypocrisie and Contradiction to himself, Malice and base Temporizing, and manifest Falshood in divers Particulars as to Matters of Fact, in clamouring against the People called Quakers, for their Declarations and Addresses to the King, of their peaceable Intentions, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>All his Allegations and Retortions upon any other whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cannot excuse (nor hold parallel with) himself, as to matter of Fact.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>His Unjustness in making General Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from some Particulars.</head>
               <p>That we reserve our Answer in readiness for publication if his Malice, prompts him to publish his, not desiring or expecting any Mercy from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:58894:8"/>That his Book, some of the Persons concerned in it do detain it, being to be communicated according to the Title-page.</p>
               <p>That his Book, if published, may be prejudicial to thousands of Innocent Unconcerned People in this Nation.</p>
               <p>And no Advantage to the Author, but to his great and utter Disgrace, Shame and Contempt, in the Eyes of all sorts of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Indifferent People, it tending to beget Jealousies and an evil Eye in the Rulers, and may bring in question all Religion under the Name of Dissenters, &amp;c. if the Lord prevent not.</p>
               <p>That if <hi>John Pennyman</hi> will not be reduced to Christianity, but proceed on in his Work, to render us obnoxious to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment (which is the tendence of much of his Book) some of our Friends, out of their Zeal for God and his Truth, Religion and People, are resolved, through God's Assistance and with his Permission, further to detect and unmask him, until he learns so much of Morality and common Civility as to live peaceably among his Neighbours, and lay aside this his Factious and Turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Work against peaceable Subjects:</p>

               <hi>Christ's Lambs defended</hi> FROM SATAN's RAGE.</head>
            <p>HAving lately had some Opportunity and Occasion to view a Book in Manuscript, entituled, <hi>The Quakers Unmasked,</hi> signed by <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> and charging the People called Quakers with <hi>Double Dealing, Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartedness, Contradictions, Confusions and Temporizing, such Wickedness as can hardly be Paralleld, as great Dissemblers, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, Deluders of the People as have appeared in this our Age, Lyers, False Prophets, and to be avoided and witnessed against, Deceitful Workers, Hypocrites;</hi> charging <hi>G. F.</hi> to be <hi>one of the greatest Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and Deceivers in this Nation, deceiving the People,</hi> threatning him with <hi>cutting down,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here's a hideous out-cry, but the Falsness and Malice thereof will appear anon, when we come to his pretended Proofs, which consist of Collections taken out of their own Writings (as he saith); which he hath so placed, that he saith, <hi>those of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Capacity may easily discern and see them to be as great Dissemblers, Deceivers and Deluders as have appeared in our Age:</hi> And for all this he pretends the Discharge of his own Conscience. His pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Collections to make his Charge obvious against the People called Quakers, are in two Columns about <hi>Contradictions and Temporizing;</hi> and this, as relating to the several Revolutions and Governments since we were a People, together with <hi>some Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations thereupon by another Hand</hi> (as he saith); but we have only <hi>Joh. Pennyman</hi>'s Name to the whole Charge, so that what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand soever it was that has helped him to compose this Piece of Malice, he has espoused the whole Matter, not only
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58894:9"/>
against particular Persons, some dead and some alive, but also against the People called Quakers in general; wherein his deadly Malice hath exceeded all common bounds. And yet upon his Paper against <hi>G. F.</hi> he has placed this Note in the Margent, viz. <hi>But is this to render him obnoxious to the Government? No, I abhor that Practice; but base and self ended Spirits are to be humbled,</hi> saith he.</p>
            <p>Now I affirm, and it may be obvious to any unbyassed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Readers, that <hi>John Pennyman</hi> hath shamefully lied, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled and temporized; lied and dissembled, in pretending that he abhors that Practice of rendring us obnoxious to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for a very mean capacity may see, that the tenour of his work is to render us obnoxious; and particularly it is more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in certain passages, as 1. from a Paper of one of our Friends, he questions us all in these words, <hi>viz. How dare these Men appeal to the King and Council's Consciences that they are harmless, and would do them no harm,</hi> &amp;c. p. 9. Now is not this to render us obnoxious as not being harmless, but such as would do them harm? And yet this is the Man that <hi>abhors such a Practice as</hi> rendring us <hi>obnoxious</hi> to the Government. <hi>2dly.</hi> Whereas in the Quakers Plea, 'tis said on the behalf of the Quakers, that though <q>some that are now called Quakers were once in the Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, when their Knowledge and Judgment were not otherwise fram'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet being altered in their Judgments to the contrary, and that it is not lawful in the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gospel, to go to war with carnal Weapons, and that there is now no danger of us, and now we are all of that mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Upon this I pass this Note, viz. <hi>that this pretended chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judgment in the Men that are Quakers, is not to be taken for a change of Judgment in the Quakers.</hi> &amp;c. Oh Malicious Insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Is not this to render us obnoxious to the Government, as to make them believe, for all this, that the Quakers count it lawful in the Administration of the Gospel, for them to go to War with carnal Weapons? Yea, that themselves may take up Arms and fight against the King, as some have done in the former Wars, before convinc'd and brought under the Gospel Administration? And what is all this but to render us the very People called Quakers as vile, perfideous and obnoxious to the Government, as he could possibly do? And not only perfideous to the Government, but to their own Gospel Profession and Principle; and what's the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58894:9"/>
Nature and Tendency hereof but to influence and incense the present Government with an evil Eye, and prejudice against us, to ruin and destroy us; as a People not fit to live in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth or under any Government; but that blessed be the Lord our God, he hath raised a better perswasion and sense of us in the Hearts of many in Power, with respect to our peaceable Conversations, which loudly have all along proclaimed our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Clearness, from such Faction and Perfideousness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Government (under which we live) as this Apostate Adversary would maliciously insinuate, so manifestly contrary to his own pretences, <hi>as abhorring the practice of making us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the Government. 3dly.</hi> Against the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, he observes, <hi>that they formerly exhorted Men to fight and would fight themselves; and now deny all fighting on any pretence, is to be imputed to their temporizing and deceit.</hi> See here again how base and contradictory he is to himself; his objection lyes chiefly against their denying <hi>all fighting or to fight themselves;</hi> for this he cries out of <hi>temporizing and deceit:</hi> Is not this still to render us obnoxious? Let the Impartial judge, and see how he endeavours to invalid and bring contempt upon all our Declarations and Applications to the King and Council, for our Innocency and peaceable Living under the present Government, according to the practice of the Primitive Christians. To his Accusation, <hi>that they</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>formerly exhorted Men to fight, and would fight themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I utterly deny it as a Slander, and put the Question to him; <hi>John,</hi> wast thou of such a Principle whilst thou own'd the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, as to fight thy self and exhort others thereunto? If thou wast, it was time for thee to be gone as one not of us. We know none such in our Society; so its most wicked and unjust to charge us <hi>as a People therewith:</hi> Another Instance he has in his Obeservations of this kind, <hi>viz. again touching fighting, they have taken care to record what one of their Ministry saith; we directed all People to the Spirit of the Lord God in them, and if that led them to fight, I had nothing against it,</hi> for this he quotes Fol. 4. but tells us not what Book. This I do greatly question, <hi>for I never read it that I know of;</hi> however I cannot believe without better evidence, that any Minister of ours did ever preach such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin to Friends or People, as <hi>that the Spirit of the Lord might
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58894:10"/>
lead them to fight with carnal Weapons,</hi> &amp;c. since our Testimony and Judgmment has always been to the contrary; to wit, that our Weapons are not carnal but spiritual, and mighty through God; and we wrestle not with Flesh and Blood, but with spiritual wickedness; and we war not after the Flesh nor with a carnal Sword, but with the Sword of the Spirit, which is, the word of God.</p>
            <p>And if any one hath writ to any in Power, to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That if they would walk with the Lord and preserve his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the numberless number of this now distressed People would be to them a Strength, and stand by them in the day of Trouble, and be a Defence unto them according to what is cited.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">(This he says, <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>E. B.</hi> told <hi>Rich. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,</hi> and quotes <hi>good Council and Advice,</hi> p. 44. Which is a Falshood touching <hi>G. F.</hi> for that was none of his Paper, <hi>nor his Words or Stile;</hi> here he has falsly entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that to <hi>G. F.</hi> which was none of his.)</note> Howbeit this is not a Proof that the People called Quakers, intended to fight for <hi>R. Cromwel</hi> or any in Authority, seeing there are other and better ways of defence for a Government, than fighting by carnal Weapons, as Righteousness which exalts a Nation; the Prayers and Faith of true Christians and Believers, which was the Mind and Practice of the Primitive Christians for those in Authority; not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding their civil Contributions, Taxes, Customs and Dues, which has been our Practice to pay, since we were a People; and that Nations and Governments are not always defended by fighting, carnal Weapons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by a better way and means, to wit, the fear of the Lord according to his Law; observe this instance in the time of King <hi>Jehosaphat</hi>'s Reign, when he sought to the Lord God, the Lord establish'd the Kingdom in his hand, and when he caused the Law of the Lord to be taught in <hi>Judah,</hi> that the fear of the Lord fell upon all the Kingdoms of the Lands; they made no war against <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> see 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. and 10. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 29, 30. therefore the fear of the Lord and his Power, was and is a better Defence to a Kingdom or Nation, than Wars and Fighting.</p>
            <p>Now having proved from few Instances, what a manifest Hypocrite, and malicious Temporizer <hi>John Pennyman</hi> is (as also his obscure Agent, who writ his Observations) I shall proceed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58894:10"/>
to evince more of his Falshood, Slander, Baseness and Shallowness in his Reflections and Observations, not looking upon it a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Vindication of our selves and our Innocency, only to discover his Malice, Out-rage and Inconsistency; but I have something to demonstrate on the behalf of our Judgment, Practice and Conversation, as we are a People which any indifferent and unprejudiced Reader may easily perceive or distinguish from his envious Objections and Invectives, and how consistent we are, and have all-a-long been in our Judgment and Practice, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still the Testimony of a Good Conscience to rejoyce in both in the Sight of God and Men, both with respect to the Kingdom and Government of Christ, as head over his Church, and Law-giver to his People, and to the Governments among Men.</p>
            <p>First then, to his Preface, on which much of his Work had a Dependence, where he thus proceeds, <hi>viz. When I have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered how the Quakers have Writ and Printed against the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, Independents, and others, for being ingaged in the Late Wars,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it hath exceedingly amazed and astonished me, That they who were so great Justifyers and Encouragers not only of what had been done in the Late Wars, but also did Incite, and Encourage those that were therein ingaged, not to leave off until they had set up their Standard at the Gates of</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c. And yet for them to upbraid others with that which themselves for many Years were so deeply concerned and engaged in,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who had not been more engaged, if so much, as themselves, in the late Wars—When they themselves had been ingaged in the same Cause and Quarrel with those whom they now so much reproach,</hi> &amp;c. Thus far <hi>J. P.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I do conscientiously answer, that he hath most grosly and palpably belied the People called Quakers in these Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages divers ways: First, in rendring them, without exception of Persons, not only Justifiers of the Late Wars, and of what had been done therein, without exception of Things done; but also equally concerned with the Presbyterians, Independents and others therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In rendring the People called <hi>Quakers, as being as much (or more) ingaged in the Late Wars as the Presbyterians, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,</hi> &amp;c. When in the Time and Heat of those Wars, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58894:11"/>
People called Quakers were not a People,<note place="margin">The War began in 1641, and in the Year 1648 the King was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and all this while no Quakers heard of in the Nation, nor till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 50, 51, or 52. when there was no Wars in <hi>England</hi> for them to be concerned in; How false then is <hi>J. P.</hi> to say, The Quakers were as much or more concerned in the War against the King as any other?</note> nor so gathered and constituted as a People, under that Name, Principle or Profession as now, as 'tis well known in this Nation; whereas 'tis not unknown, That both Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, Independents and some others, were both gathered and constituted as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Peoples, and as such both Ministers and their People, many of them concerned in the Late Wars, how far both in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Subscriptions and Actings, is also well known (yet hope that some of them have learned better things ere this time a Day) so that in this Case there is a vast disparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the People called Quakers; therefore the very Ground and Foundation of <hi>John Pennyman</hi>'s Quarrel against us in this Matter (as being so greatly ingaged in the Late Wars, and Justifiers of what had been done, that is, all that was done) in those Wars; This I affirm to be a great Lye against the People called Quakers, and yet grant him, That divers who have been since, and now are of us the People called Quakers, have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been concerned in the Late Wars, while under the Notion of Presbyterians, Independents, Anabaptists and other Perswasions; yea many also who served the King in those Wars, until they became better principled and of another Spirit, through the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Day of Christ and his Power unto them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many were made not only to lay down their Commissions and Offices, desert the Army, relinquish Fighting, but also to break their Swords, Spears, and other Weapons of War, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them into necessary Uses, according to that Evangelical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of <hi>Esaiah,</hi> ch. 2. as knowing that Christ's Kingdom is not of this World; and therefore his Servants must not Fight, and at his Command every one must put up and lay aside their Swords as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> yea <hi>Peter</hi> must not fight for Christ, but suffer with him, if he intends to reign with him. Here many, who had been concerned in those Battles that were with confused Noise and Garments rowled in Blood, are now come to that which is with Burning and Fuel of Fire, in order to the Consumption of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58894:11"/>
all that Fuel, Lust, Pride, Enmity and Ambition, from whence Wars have risen, and which have been the original Cause thereof, though many were zealous and consciencious, according to what they believed, in those former Wars, even of those several Perswasions before-mentioned; and my shewing our Adversary's Falsness in his Comparison between the Quakers and Presbyterians in this Case, is not to vilifie or reproach them or any others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause concerned therein, hoping some of them are now better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but am necessitated to mention them in this Case, to shew the Disparity and Falsness of this Adversary's Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, who now appears as a rigid Persecutor, to take up and maintain a distinct Quarrel against us, for the Presbyterians and Independents against the Quakers, as for not only upbraiding, but reproaching and vilifying them, <hi>for being ingaged in the Late Wars,</hi> while he falsly saith, <hi>We were so great Justifyers and Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers of what had been done therein:</hi> Hereupon, as the principal Occasion of all his Quarrel after, his charging us with <hi>the most revengeful and highest aggravating Terms that was possible for our Pen to express;</hi> He thus proceeds, <hi>viz. witness those Words to the Nonconforming Ministers, in answer to Mr.</hi> Faldo, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>But why, poor Nonconformists, after all these preached-up Battles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, they are true Gospel-Ministers, whose Gospel is Peace on Earth, and good Will towards Men, and not Garments rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Blood of Kings and Princes, Rulers and People, no worldly Armies, Battles, Victories, Trophies, Spoyls, Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, Decimations, and the like, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And then <hi>J. P.</hi> as a Person highly disgusted at this and as greatly simpathizing, or rather temporizing with the Presbyterians, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents and probably some of his private discontented.

What people, setting these aside, could have had the Face and Confidence to have writ such Language as this? certainly not any, especially when they themselves had been engaged in the same Cause and Quarrel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>First, let it be here noted, That <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> in his great Zeal for the Nonconformists, and enmity against us, hath still proceeded upon his great Lye against the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, ☞ <hi>As what People, setting these aside, could have had the Face, when they themselves had beening aged in the same Cause?</hi> See what an apparent Lye this is, and I charge him with it, To prove
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58894:12"/>
where the People called Quakers were so ingaged in the same Cause, as to preach up Battles, Spoils, Plunders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Garments rowled in the Blood of Kings, Princes, Rulers, and People world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Armies and Battles, Victories, Trophies, Spoils, Sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Decimations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from which he doth not vindicate and acquit <hi>John Faldo</hi> and his Brethren, but only cries out of Reproach, Revengeful and Aggravating Terms, vilifying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such an Agent have the Nonconformists as <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> who instead of vindicating them from these Matters commemorated against them (on their occasion first given) he belies the people called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, as being ingaged in the same; and as if <hi>John Faldo</hi> and his Brethren were so big and eminent in <hi>John Pennyman</hi>'s Eyes, and such awful and formidable Persons, he put this admiring question, <hi>viz.</hi> What people, setting these aside, could have had the Face and Confidence to have writ such Language as this? Oh wonderful! is <hi>John Faldo</hi> and his Brethren, the Nonconformists, grown so potent, so awful, so austere or formidable, that it is such a dangerous business to affront them, by reminding them of their former Concerns in the Late Wars, their preached up Battels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even at such a Time when <hi>John Faldo, Thomas Hicks</hi> the Baptist Forger of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, and others, both Presbyterians, Independents and Baptists, and their Learned and Reverend one and twenty Divines, as they call them, have endeavoured with all their Force not only to unchristian us, but to render us as odious and obnoxious in the Face of the Nation, not only to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but to Government, as possibly they could, with their Pens, as <hi>Cheats, Impostures, yea the vilest of Men,</hi> thus putting us in Bear-skins, to make People destroy us in the open Streets, or as if they would swallow us up at once; witness the muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Forces at <hi>Barbican, Thomas Hick</hi>'s Dialogues, <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Quakerism no Christianity, and his Vindication thereof, there rendring us as <hi>inconsistent with Human Society, destructive of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in our Principles,</hi> wherein some Baptists and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting Spirits, plainly shewed its Sting and Venom, but it cannot penetrate our Armour of Light nor hurt us. These Occasions against us, <hi>John Pennyman</hi> is pleased to take no notice of, and yet counts it a heinous piece of Confidence, to remind such Nonconformists of their former Preachings, of Battles, Sequestrations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contrary to the Gospel of Peace and good
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58894:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Will towards Men, wherein <hi>John Pennyman</hi> himself dares not adventure to excuse them, though now he strikes in with them against us; however he may see that there are some among us, that has the Face and Confidence, to oppose both <hi>John Faldo, Thomas Hicks,</hi> and <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> in their great Enmity against us; and I do not see that <hi>John Pennyman's</hi> espousing their cause and quarrel, and abusing us as he hath done, will stop our Pens, considering the many occasions given against us, not only in their late Invectives, but also in the former cruel Persecutions and Sufferings (which many of us indured) both by Presbyterians and Independents, their Ministers, Magistrates and People in <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi>'s days: Yea, how many caused they in those days to be Imprisoned till Death, Stocked, Whipped; besides the Stoning, Beating and Abusing by the rude Multitude, when incensed by their Ministers and Leaders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of these things <hi>John Pennyman</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be altogether ignorant; nor of the Professors in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Cruelty, in putting several of our faithful Friends to death for their righteous Testimony; whose innocent Blood the Guilty there, have not washed their hands of, nor have they here given a publick Testimony against that cruelty, that we know of. So let <hi>John Pennyman</hi> consider what credit he will gain, by closing in with such Presbyterians and Independents. I wish both he and they who are alive, may examin themselves and repent, and if he and they be still of the mind that our Pen hath been too sharp, we are sure their cruel Hands, their Goals in Old <hi>England,</hi> and Gallows in <hi>New-England</hi> have been far sharper. And now with their malicious Tongues and Pens (not having Power to persecute as before) by their Forgeries, they would make the World believe that we are <hi>no Christians,</hi> &amp;c. but we are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known to Christ and honest Men: As also our so much bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and suffering <hi>John Pennyman</hi> and his Party, in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick outrage and frequent disturbances and interruptions in our Meetings, without exercising or seeking Revenge against them, being so far from encouraging any to beat or lay <hi>violent Hands</hi> on them, that we have laboured to quiet those People, that have had much ado sometimes to keep their Hands off them, by reason of their turbulent Provocations; all this sufficiently evidences that our Principle and Spirit is against Fighting, for I am confident, that had <hi>I. P.</hi> look't on us as Fighters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58894:13"/>
durst not have adventured to have given us such frequent and publick occasions of Provocation, as he and his Party have done, which he knows his Friends the Nonconformists would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their Assemblies, but would have paid him and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany off to purpose, had he abused them and their Meetings, as he hath done us and ours.</p>
            <p>And to manifest <hi>John Pennyman</hi> and his two or three late Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and Disciples, what hideous disturbances have they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made, in some of our publick Meetings in <hi>London?</hi> And more particularly his Disciple <hi>B. Boyce,</hi> who hath shewn a very venerable respect to him, and <hi>T. P.</hi> little less for him, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming him openly to be an upright or sincere Man; and yet this <hi>John Pennyman</hi>'s upright Man, after his various attempts to the Magistrates, to swear the Peace against divers, that never did or intended him harm, his outrage and violence in several Meetings has been notorious. And <hi>John Pennyman</hi>'s own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy surpasses all this against the People called Quakers, in rendring them obnoxious to the Government (contrary to his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) as will yet further appear.</p>
            <p>Now we come to his pretended <hi>Contradiction and Temporizing,</hi> unjustly charged upon us the People called Quakers from our Writings, which as he reckons are so placed, <hi>that those of the meanest Capacity, may easily see them to be as great Dissemblers, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers and Deluders of the People,</hi> &amp;c. and this hideous outcry and clamour he makes, as <hi>1st.</hi> wherein he set <hi>G. Fox</hi> against <hi>G. Fox.</hi> in his judgment concerning <hi>Kingly Government;</hi> and withal let it be remarked, that his Observations and Objections are chiefly made against those Declarations, made to the King and present Powers, signifying our innocent Intentions of living peaceably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Government, our honouring the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Against this lyes the charge of <hi>Hypocrisie, Temporizing and Apostacy, &amp;c.</hi> But why should it become a heinous crime in his view, for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to signifie their Intentions of peaceable Living, and respect to a King or Kingly Government, although some of them have for merly expressed <hi>a Fear and Zeal,</hi> as he grants, about Kingly Government, which is thus to be understood, <hi>of an Earthly oppressing King;</hi> as it was feared some in <hi>O. C</hi>'s. days would have constituted and set up, when they were doting for an earthly King to establish and impose their own Religion upon the Nation contrary to their great pretence to Jesus Christ his Headship and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58894:13"/>
Kingship over the Church; this was the very thing for which <hi>G. F.</hi> and others fore-warned and reprehended them <note n="†" place="margin">Note that the words that most tended to clear <hi>G. F's.</hi> intent in this matter, <hi>J. P.</hi> very unfairly leaves out, as after <hi>Earthly King,</hi> he leaves out, (<hi>and earthly Powers, and will change as they change</hi>) As also, (<hi>have put out Christ, and would not have him to reign</hi>) these words he leaves out. As also, after (<hi>all Kings made in Mens earthly wills</hi>) he leaves out (THAT WILL NOT HAVE CHRIST TO REIGN) These with several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther material pasages, hath <hi>J. P.</hi> very dissinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously left out of those several passages quoted by him, writ long before the K's. Restauration, tho' Printed the year before.</note> Now where's the contradiction? Is it between opposing an earthly Kingship over a Christian Church, and owning Jesus Christ as the only King, Head and Lawgiver to his Church? Sure no true Christian nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Man will conclude a contradiction here. And where's the <hi>Temporizing or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy?</hi> Have we ever declined Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship over his Church throughout the whole World, and set up an earthly King over the Church, instead of Christ? We af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm we have not, and this is our present case, still having this distinction between Christ's Kingly Office over his Church in Spiritual Divine Matters, and the Office of National Kings or Rulers in Civil Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; it having been always our principle to render to God his dues, and to <hi>Caesar</hi> his dues distinctly. But to come more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the business objected against us, as contradiction and temporizing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the matter lies here, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Between what one formerly said, some time before the King was Restored, viz. <hi>do not the Priests and Presbyterians,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>cry for an earthly King? Are not all these Elders Christians, that will dote <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o much of an earthly King, Traytors against Christ? And the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers declaring since<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King was restored,</hi> viz. <q>that our Intentions and Endeavours are and shall be good, true, honest and peaceable towards the King and present Governours, and that we do love and honour them, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Wheres the contradiction here? Is it between warning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of going to set up an earthly King in Christ's stead, <hi>and</hi> declaring our honest Intentions towards the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after brought in and set up by a providential Hand of God? Or does it follow that because some of us have declared, a dislike of having a rigid persecuting King set over us, to intrench upon Christs prerogative, that therefore we must not submit to the over-ruling Hand of God in bringing in a King, whether in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58894:14"/>
Mercy or Judgment, or both? We shall not dispute that now; must we be counted Temporizers, for quietly submitting to the over-ruling Power of God in this matter? See how obnoxious our Adversary renders himself; for those who formerly feared it would be worse for the Nation to have a Monarchy, as to <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,</hi> &amp;c. he hath this Salvo, <hi>that it was out of Zeal, that some particular Persons did write against Kingly Government, among whom he ranks</hi> G. F. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The former Writings against Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as he apprehends them, were out <hi>of Zeal and Fear of greater Impositions and Bondage;</hi> but for such to signifie their peaceable Intentions and Respect to the King when restored, this is counted an <hi>earthly Temporizing.</hi> How now <hi>J. P.</hi> is this thy <hi>Conscience that thou dischargest?</hi> What art thou offended at our innocent plainness? But how shallow art thou, who when thou hast excused all that thou apprehendst against a Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, from <hi>G. F.</hi> or others, as being <hi>from a Fear and Zeal,</hi> yet now makes it a <hi>contradiction</hi> and <hi>temporizing,</hi> for the Quakers to declare their Truth and Fidelity, to the King and present Governours, with their Intentions of Honesty and Peaceableness towards them? Oh shallow Man! Is here either contradiction or temporizing? It had been contradiction, if they had said they intended neither Truth, Fidelity, Honesty or Peaceableness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King; and it had been temporizing, if they had said they now submit all cases of Conscience, Religion and Worship, to an earthly King to be disposed, ordered and determined at his discretion, and not to Christ, the heavenly King and Head of his Church: But blessed be God we are clear of these things, and out of the reach of thy malicious Spirit, who hast thus grosly slandered us with Contradiction, Temporizing, Dissemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thou canst not be ignorant, how many of us have suffered for our tender Consciences, under the several Powers since we were a People, and still dayly exposed to Sufferings; therefore thou art the Temporizer, in going about thus to rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er us obnoxious to the Government, and thereby to add to our Afflictions and Sufferings; and note, that whatsoever <hi>G. F.</hi> or others did formerly write (to Presbyterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which thou apprehendst to be against Kingly Government, whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Persecution, Oppression or Bondage, which they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might happen thereby, according to the instance given of <hi>Herod, Saul,</hi> &amp;c. this thou dost not go about to disprove, as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58894:14"/>
being from a fallible Spirit, but hast salved the matter with this, being out of a <hi>Fear, Zeal,</hi> &amp;c. But thy hideous outcry is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any of our Friends, declaring their <hi>honest Intentions of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Peace and Respect to the King;</hi> here thou art offended at the words, <hi>Loyal Subjects,</hi> in a Declaration, which thou sayst, <hi>were highly opposed in an Assembly:</hi> And I ask thee, wast not thou one of them, who opposed and caused them to be left out? How now <hi>John,</hi> what a Labyrinth art thou fallen into, through thy En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and Malice? but to come yet more closely to the business, to evince thy malicious silliness; set case that some of our Friends did really fear, that a King set up by those that were then our Persecutors, as a Creature of their forming, designed to carry on their own Interest, would not be for the universal Interest and Liberty of the Nation, both in matters Religious and Civil; and thereupon warned them (which is our present case in debate) and yet when it pleased the Lord providentially to bring in the King quietly, to acknowledge their Submission and Peaceableness, and to prevent further censure of a temporizing Insinuation in this case—I do declare that what Form of Religion soever a King be of, he must so far distinguish between his Regal Power and his Religion, as to be tender to his Subjects under several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions, and grant a free Tolleration and Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; or else if he rule either as a Presbyterian, a formal Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalian, or severe Papist, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and endeavour to enforce his form of Religion upon all, it will not answer the wisdom of God or his Counsel, nor tend to the universal Good or Satisfaction of the People; so not to his own Prosperity and Quiet, but on the contrary, an universal tenderness and free liberty in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters will. Now <hi>John,</hi> darst thou yet say that our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and submission, as before, is <hi>Temporizing,</hi> or that they are Dissemblers and Deceivers therein? If thou darst, let this one instance among many others, confute thy blindness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thy malice; as namely the case of <hi>Samuel</hi> (that faithful Servant of the Lord) when <hi>Israel</hi> cryed to have a King set over them like other Nations, this thing displeased <hi>Samuel, or was evil in the Eyes of</hi> Samuel (according to the Hebrew) and yet for all this, when the Lord had commanded him to hearken to their voice, and shew them the manner of their King, <hi>&amp;c. Samuel</hi> in Obedience to the word of the Lord, anoynted <hi>Saul</hi> and kissed him, and said, is it not because the Lord hath anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58894:15"/>
thee? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> see 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> chap. 8. 5, 6. and chap. 10. 1. Dare <hi>John Pennyman</hi> say, that <hi>Samuel</hi> was a temporizing Hypocrite herein, or was <hi>Samuel</hi> insincere in this matter? And may he not see how nearly this suits the case of <hi>G. F.</hi> and others whom he so bitterly enveighs against? yea, did not <hi>Samuel</hi>'s concern herein exceed the occasion <hi>J. P.</hi> carps at? Which shews his implacable Envy and Revenge, still to render us obnoxious to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, contrary to his pretence of <hi>abhorring such practice.</hi> Now <hi>I. P.</hi> see what an envious Hypocrite thou art, and how manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted: And yet further from Scripture Testimony, which I must bring over thine head, see <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 20, 21. Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever, for Wisdom and Might are his, and he <hi>Changeth</hi> the Times and Seasons, he removeth Kings and setteth up Kings. See here how plainly he confesseth it is God that doth these things; and also said unto <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the God of Heaven hath given to thee a Kingdom, Power and Strength, ver. 37. and yet for all this confessed, that in the days of these Kings, the God of Heaven should set up a Kingdom which should never be destroyed, and the Kingdoms shall not be left to other People, but it shall break in pieces, and consume all these Kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever, ver. 44. (And did not <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> confess to God's Power and Kingdom as above his own?) How plainly in his Visions did he see and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to the Kingdom of God and his Christ, as over all these earthly Kings and Kingdoms, Beasts and Horns mentioned, <hi>Dan.</hi> chap. 7. yea concerning the Ancient of days and the Son of Man; that there was given him Dominion and Glory, and a Kingdom, that all Kingdoms, Nations and Languages should serve him; his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion, which shall not pass away; and his Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, ver. 14. Did <hi>Daniel</hi> herein contradict himself or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize, in confessing, that it is God that changeth Times, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth and setteth up Kings, and that even <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> had his Power and Strength given him of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 37. and was not <hi>Daniel</hi> one of them that stood in the King's Palace? And did not the King make <hi>Daniel</hi> Ruler over the whole Province of <hi>Babylon? Dan.</hi> 6. 21. But <hi>Daniel</hi> sat in the Gate of the King. Or did he temporize with King <hi>Darius,</hi> in saying, O King live for ever? And yet for all this he confessed to the Kingdom of God and of his Christ, as above all these
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58894:15"/>
earthly Kings and Kingdoms, and that it should stand for ever. And what more hath <hi>G. F.</hi> said, viz. <hi>That Christ will reign over all these Presbyterians imitated Elders, their earthly Kings,</hi> &amp;c. (knowing also that such Trees as they were, would be more apt to chuse a Bramble for a King, than the Vine, Olive or Fig-Tree.) And what he means by these earthly Kings, is apparent in these words, Herod <hi>the King was mad at the Child Jesus, and sought to slay all the Children in</hi> Bethlehem <hi>and</hi> Judea; <hi>there is the Fruits of earthly Kings; and <hi>such</hi> a King, would our false Christians and Elders have;</hi> mark by [earthly Kings] <hi>Persecuting Kings</hi> as the Kings of the Earth set themselves, and the Rulers take Counsel together against the Lord and his anoynted; yet he that sitteth in the Heavens shall vex them, and his anoynted shall break them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> see <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. throughout. And the Kings of the Earth were such that committed Fornication with the great Whore, who was drunken with the blood of the Saints, and who (as its said) reigneth over the Kings of the Earth; see <hi>Rev.</hi> 17 and 18. Chapters. And was it not the Apostate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that doted so much for such-earthly Kings to be set over them, to inforce People by outward Coertion to their form of Religion? Did ever the true Christians call out for <hi>such</hi> Kings to be set over them? Did not Christ say the Kings of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles exercise Lordship over them, but it shall not be so among you? Now where's the Temporizing? We retain (and are not ashamed of) our Principles, for Christ and his Kingdom above all the Dominions of the Earth; yea, and his Soveraignity and Kingship over our Consciences, we cannot give to another; we trust in and serve the Living God, and the Devil and all his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents and Apostate Incendiaries shall not deter us out of this. And yet our Adversary judgeth us Apostates, for declaring our Love and Honour to the National King, saying, <hi>are not they in their own judgments become Apostates, for now they say they Love, own and Honour an earthly King.</hi> So that in this Man's Sense it is an <hi>Apostacy,</hi> for any one to shew Respect and Honour to the King (though by the Providence and over-ruling Hand of God resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) especially so long after they have shewn a dislike to some Mens endeavouring to set up a King in their earthly Wills; but if he make the worst on't, he might more safely have said, <hi>they are reformed in their judgments who own the King after such dislike,</hi> than <hi>that they are Apostates:</hi> But the Man's malice makes himself obnoxious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:58894:16"/>And where do we use these very Words (<hi>Earthly King</hi>) on this occasion, but that we love, own and honour the King (whom here this Man has judged an earthly King) does this shew us to be Apostates? what a factious peevish Spirit is this we have to deal withal? Could not the Primitive Christians shew their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and Honour to Kings and Governours, but they must be Apostates from Christ, or his Kingship over the Conscience? or was their fearing God and honouring the King, a Contradiction or Temporizing? as if we could not Fear God and Honour the King too; Oh malicious Man! where hast thou lost both Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty and Wit? did not <hi>Shadrach, Meshach</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> yea and <hi>Daniel</hi> also, who were Children of <hi>Judah,</hi> serve and attend upon the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> in his Court? dare this Man charge them with being temporizers therein, whereas yet they could not obey the King's Command, wherein it was contrary to the Law of their God, but must rather incur the Penalty and Hazard of a fiery Furnace and a Lyons Den than bow to an Image, pray to the King, or worship contrary to the Law of their God; see <hi>Dan.</hi> the third Chapter, and Chapter sixth; for their Adversaries could find no occasion against them, concerning the Kingdom, but sought Matter against them concerning the Law of their God; and God appeared for them in their Faithfulness to him, to the Conviction of their Persecutors, insomuch that both <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> confessed to the Power and Kingdom of the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who is God of Gods and Lord of Kings, saying, <hi>I Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar praise, extol and honour the King of Heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment, and those who walk in pride he is able to abase:</hi> And said King <hi>Darius, I make a decree that in every domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end,</hi> Dan. 6. 26. So that he would have had all his Subjects Quakers, when he saw the Kingdom of God above his own.</p>
            <p>Again, although we are most unjustly traduced as Temporizers, because of our Applications to the present King and Government, and partly because of some former Letters writ by some Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars to the Protector and Parliament, warning them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is no proof of our Adversaries Charge against the People called Quakers, their many and great Sufferings, both in those Days and since, to keep a Conscience clear to God, still acquits them from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58894:16"/>
being such Temporizers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>John Pennyman</hi> has infamously rendred them, since we the said People have not looked for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, from the Mountains nor from the Hills, but from the Lord of Hosts; we have not reposed our confidence in the Arm of Flesh nor in Princes, but in the over-ruling Power and Name of the Lord our God: It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in Man; it is better to trust in the Lord than put confidence in Princes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 8, 9. Again, put not your trust in Princes, nor in the Son of Man in whom there is no help; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he that hath the God of <hi>Jacob</hi> for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God which made Heaven and Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which execute judgment for the oppressed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 146. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Moreover we have not been wanting, to warn and admonish those in Power, both Parliaments, Protector and King, against Persecution and Oppression, as the Lord hath laid it upon us; nor has any of our Addresses to the King, been to stop any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or Servant of the Lord among us, from warning him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that our clearness from our Adversaries unjust Imputations, is manifest divers ways; and of these things he cannot be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant. And as for his citing of <hi>G. F.</hi> to the <hi>Protector and Parliament,</hi> warning him <hi>to keep Kingship from off his Head, which some would have given, and</hi> his bidding the Powers of the Earth, <hi>take beed of making earthly Kings,</hi> &amp;c. And what can <hi>John Pennyman</hi> make of this? He should have allowed this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction as he has for others, that if <hi>O. C.</hi> had been made King as some would have had him, he would have been the greater Hypocrite; and it was his zeal for the good of those People, that had been against a King, to warn them of setting up or making <hi>such an earthly King, in their earthly Wills,</hi> as his Words are plain, as in the other passages cited before; and this Zeal and Fear of the consequence, <hi>J. P.</hi> does not go about to disprove as erronious there, but would have it run most to our disadvantage, wherein he probably may think his way secure, seeing us a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have been trod upon as to our Persons and Estates, being exposed to so many Sufferings and Spoyls (as we were) he can throw dirt upon us, render us obnoxious to the Government, and so help to afflict us and trample upon us, our Testimony and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Reputation; to bring us under Infamy, Reproach and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem, if possible; yea, and the severe displeasure of the Powers, (and yet pretend to abhor such a thing) this is the nature of

his Temporizing, Malice and Revenge; God will stop him and frustrate him in his Carreer, with his private Abetters and Assistants, I doubt not.</p>
            <p>What he cites of <hi>E. Boroughs</hi> Answer to the Apprentices Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 1659. against bringing in a strange Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing Monarchy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this he might easily have excused with that same Provision for others in the like Case, as namely it was out of his <hi>Zeal and Fear, that it would have been worse with the Nation,</hi> &amp;c. But, says he, all these Lines are left out (and so he saith of <hi>F. H.</hi> in one Paper) And upon some other Passages in <hi>E. B</hi>'s. Works, of <hi>divers Words, being left out, expunged,</hi> &amp;c. This Man might very well have let <hi>E. B.</hi> alone, since he is gone to his rest; if he had been charitable, or but as good as a Moral Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, among whom it was a Maxim, <hi>de Mortuis nil nisi bene,</hi> but especially since <hi>J. P.</hi> had Time to have told <hi>E. B.</hi> of this in his Life-time (he being not here now to answer for himself) and doubtless he was so tender a Man as he would have heard him, if he would have given him any friendly Caution; but thus to cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and abuse Honest Men, that are at rest, is very ignoble, especially since <hi>J. P.</hi> owned them in their Life-time, and some Time after, and <hi>F. H.:</hi> Nor do we think our selves bound di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to prostrate our Judgments concerning all particulars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such a malicious Adversary as <hi>J. P.</hi> or so far to own his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of Men so long after they are dead, when they cannot be here to answer for themselves; however dare our Adversary say otherwise of <hi>E. B.</hi> and <hi>F. H.</hi> than that they were sincere-hearted Men to what was then manifest? and zealous Servants and true Prophets of God, and vindicators of Truth in the several Currents and Streams of their Writings, as may be seen in their Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and Conditional Threats against the late Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And did not thou <hi>J. P.</hi> say, That <hi>E. B.</hi> was faithful in his Day? and I doubt not but their Names are recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life, though abused by this Man; wherein all may see his Malice is so deadly, that it extends to the very Grave, as if he would hang us all up, even the Dead as well as the Living. As for what he cites of <hi>G. F.</hi> to <hi>Oliver,</hi> dated the eleventh Month 1657. as to the <hi>Success he might have had, if he had been Faithful, and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered down Deceit, and asking why they put such as feared God out of the Army? Sober Men and True Hearts, such as the Lord owned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:58894:17"/>How plain is it that he judged <hi>O. C.</hi> as one unfaithful to his former Promises, specious Pretences for the Liberties and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Subjects, for Liberty to tender Consciences, taking off Oppression, and particularly that of Tythes, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to remove, when he was low in his Mind, in the Time of the Wars, praying to God, weeping, saying, Our Eyes are towards thee O Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Surely if <hi>J. P.</hi> cannot say, That he had no Success in those Days, much less can he determine what Success he might have had against the Pope, as he pretended, if he had performed his Promises; and he was reproveable for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out honest Men for their Consciences, the more, because that was a Breach of his Promise of Liberty to tender Consciences; but there were many, when they saw the Self-endedness of <hi>O. C.</hi> and his Apostacy from the Cause which so many ventured and lost their Lives for, they deserted the Army, without being put out of it; and I am perswaded, That reproving him for putting such out of the Army for their Consciences, was more upon his Breach of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, than with an Intent to have them always continue in it, in order to War, and fight, especially under so much as the Notion of Quakers, who conscientiously deny fighting and Blood-shed: But here seems to be the main Objection, <hi>They were sober Men, and such as feared God, therefore they must need be Quakers, and to continue them in Arms, to fight, kill and shed Blood, must needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the Quakers have since declared to the King.</hi> That they must needs be absolute Quakers; because faithful to what they then knew, does not follow; for <hi>Paul</hi> was sincere, from his Youth upward, to what he professed before his Conversion, and divers had some Convincement and Fear of God upon them, in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, before they were either converted so far as to be Quakers, or did clearly see, That Wars and Fighting did not consist with the Gospel Dispensation and New Covenant; but many, when they did see it, came out from them, and did leave them volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily; therefore it is a false Observation and Inference that <hi>G. F.</hi> his Judgment was, <hi>That Quakers might Fight,</hi> but rather that it was a Breach of Promise, and reproveable in <hi>O. C.</hi> to turn truer Men than himself out of the Army, before so far convinced as to lay down their Weapons: And if he should argue, That Christ was contradictory to himself, in suffering <hi>Peter,</hi> one of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to wear a Sword (before fully converted) because he saith, my Kingdom is not of this World, this would not be taken
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58894:18"/>
for any good Argument, especially among Christians; so that this Man's deridingly calling the Quakers <hi>these peaceable Men,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously inveighing against them as <hi>Temporizers,</hi> because of their Declarations to the King, neither proves them such, nor can he thereby invalid those Declarations, and particularly that to the King, in the Year 1660. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>All Bloody Principles and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we, as to our own Particular do utterly deny, with all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Wars and Strife, and Fighting with outward Weapons, for any End or Pretence whatsoever; so those that use any Weapon to fight for Christ, or for the establishing his Kingdom or Government, both the Spirit, Principle and Practice that we deny, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And this Testimony we still maintain and stand for; and where's the Contradiction and Temporizing? Have we ever declared, That we have owned Bloody Principles or Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? or that we would fight with Carnal Weapons for Christ, or for the establishing of his Kingdom and Government? while he cannot prove this, where's the Contradiction? and then where is the Temporizing? is it in denying Bloody Principles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring our peaceable Intentions, to live quietly in Godliness and honesty under the King and Government? or in giving Testimony against those that would fight for Christ, or the establishing his Kingdom by Carnal Weapons of War, and would build up <hi>Sion,</hi> with Blood? Have we not all along been against such a Practice? And have not our peaceable Conversations declared the same? Were not the Primitive Christians exhorted to be subject to the Higher Powers, seeing they were ordained of God? And dare he say this was a Temporizing in the Primitive Christians? No, does not the Apostle plainly say, Ye must needs be subject, not only for Wrath but for Conscience-sake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This Subjection for Conscience-sake surely was not temporizing, and the Subjection we owe to the Civil Powers, whether Active or Passive, so as we may keep our Consciences clear to God, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or suffering, and as the Apostle further exhorted, put them in mind to be subject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and to be ready to every good Work, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. And this was without exception against the Name (<hi>King</hi>) or other, and submit your selves to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the King as supreme, or unto the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> sent for the Punishment of Evil-doers, and the Praise of them that do well, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. So that the Primitive Christians
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58894:18"/>
did not boggle at the Name <hi>King;</hi> and for this Cause pay ye Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute also, rendring to all their Dues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ow no Man any thing but Love, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 13. 6, 7, 8. And the true Christians, though they suffered for Christ, and underwent many Injuries from Men, yet they were to live peaceably with all Men; they were not so much as to avenge themselves, but rather to give Place unto Wrath, <hi>for vengeance is mine, and I will repay, saith the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12. 18, 19. Herein they granted a Vengeance was due, but were not to avenge themselves.</p>
            <p>To our Adversaries saying, <hi>That the Soldiers were charged to go forth with a free willing Heart,</hi> &amp;c. Here is a Perversion in this; for their Charge was, they should keep in the Fear of the Lord, that they might not lose the Dread of the Lord: And dare this Man say, That none of them had the Dread of the Lord, at any Time upon them? And that Advice given to <hi>O. C. Do not stand cumbering thy self about dirty Priests,</hi> &amp;c. This he cites, but to what Purpose it shews; for his cumbering himself with such Covetous Priests, he was reproveable, and the setting up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting such Priests, hath not consisted with the Good of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under any Government.</p>
            <p>Again, I find in his Notes against <hi>Francis Howghill,</hi> where it is said, That it is <hi>no Rebellion to call away those in Power</hi> (he hath this Aggravation added) <hi>viz. by which he means to <hi>Depose</hi> those in Power, that perform not their Trust for the Good of the People,</hi> p. 4. See here how obnoxious to the Government he hath gone about to render the Quakers, by this perverse addition of a meaning, he hath put upon <hi>F. H.</hi> as if to <hi>call away</hi> and to <hi>Depose</hi> were both one in common Acceptance, and yet this is the Man that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to abhor that Practice of rendring us obnoxious to the Government: Pray, how can we trust him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he should have been so charitable as not to have aggravated the matter with such a Meaning added; especially since it concerned a Man who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, and dyed a Prisoner for the Testimony of Jesus, and at rest, and who in his Life-time bore a faithful Testimony for Truth and Righteousness.</p>
            <p>'Tis a most base and revengeful Spirit in <hi>J. P.</hi> to rake <hi>E. B.</hi> out of his Grave, to bring Infamy upon his name, his Gospel Testimony which he bore, and Prophetical Spirit which was in him now he is not here to answer for himself; and not rather have prevented both by Friendly Advice in his life time, when
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58894:19"/>
they were in Society; but instead thereof it may be rather questioned, whether he was not in those Cases, too much beset with such unstable Spirits as <hi>J. P.</hi> who now might have put more charitable Constructions upon <hi>E. B.</hi> and us, than he has done, namely, that he feared the effects of a Monarchy, and that he was so zealous against the great persecuting Whore, that has made her self drunk with the Blood of the Saints, that therefore he would have had the Beast that has long carried her, so to hate her as to cast her off; as being a Man who in his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit simpathized with the Martyrs of Jesus, and those Souls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar of them that were slain for the word of God, who cryed with a loud voice, how long O Lord Holy and True, dost thou not Judge and AVENGE our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
            <p>And whatsoever in any of the Writings cited by <hi>J. P.</hi> may seem disgustful as to Monarchy, we have still this cure for it all, that <hi>John Pennyman</hi> has prescribed, namely, <hi>that these things were writ out of these Mens Zeal and Fear, that Monarchy would be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive, and cause more Burthens or Impositions to be laid upon the Nation than before.</hi> And this excuse was pretty warily contrived; for if he had flung all that former Zeal and Fear into the dirt, 'tis not unlikely but he might have highly disgusted his Friends the Presbyterians and Independents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore as a Person that appears rather affected with these former Passages, which intimate a Fear concerning Monarchy, than with our late Applications to the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he has taken the great pains to collect and transcribe them the more at large, and sorely to chide us (the People called Quakers) for making Declarations and Applications to the King, Council and Parliament, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them of our faithful and peaceable Intentions, or for any Relief from the Imposition of Oaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for this we are sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chidden not only as Temporizers, but also for a late fawning flattering Address to the King and Parliament, as he is pleased to call it. We meet with no such chiding for these particular Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, that seemed to dislike of a Monarchy in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s days; for the Fear and Zeal that was therein shall either cure all that, or else <hi>John</hi> shall relinquish the Medicine of his own preparing and wheel about again, and wholly desert his Friends the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists, both Presbyters, Independents, and others of his private Abetters and Cabalistick Council.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:58894:19"/>As concerning that passage to the Officers of the Army; where after they are reproved for abusing the Power of God and loosing it, and putting them in Prison that struck at the Root (meaning the Quakers) (saith he) there is this passage, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Had you been faithful to the Power of the Lord God, you had gone into <hi>Spain,</hi> to require the Blood of the Innocent that there had been shed, and have commanded them to have offered up their Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. and knocked at <hi>Romes</hi> Gates before now, and trampled Deceit and Tyranny under: And demanded the Pope, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to have offered up all his Torture-houses, his Racks and Inquisition, &amp;c.</q> Hereupon we have several questions put upon us, viz. <hi>Could any People have declared themselves more for fighting? How should the Army set up their Standard upon the top of</hi> Rome, <hi>but by fighting? How require the Blood that has been shed in the Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by fighting?</hi> Here he may think he has sorely opposed and puzzelled us. But 'tis no very difficult matter to answer with clearness herein, and safety to our Christian principle, against killing and destroying one another; for either these Passages must be spoken as from a Prophet of God, or only as a Christian, however conditionally. First, if as a Prophet, then he speaks not always what is desirable or pleasant to him, according to his Christian Principle, nor within the compass of his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a Man, nor from any Human contrivance, but what's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him of God, as relating to Judgments or Calamities which may be of divers kinds, and then he may Speak and Prophesie of Wars and Destructions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet not at all be of such a Spirit or Principle in himself, as to maintain or desire Wars and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> who was an Evangelical Prophet, and against Wars and Fighting and saw the end thereof, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. and the Indignation of the Lord upon all Nations, and his Fury upon all their Armies, <hi>Isa.</hi> 34. 2. yet this Evangelical Prophet said, <hi>O Assyrian,</hi> the Rod of mine Anger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will send against an Hypocritical Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> see <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. 5, 6. And further, all yee Beasts of the Field come to devour, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 9. And Christ Jesus, himself who said, my Kingdom is not of this World, for if it were, my Servants would fight; yet prophesied of the sad and miserable destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and of those Murderers that slew the Heir; and said to those Hypocrites, fill ye up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of your Fathers Iniquities; and this was, that all the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Blood shed, might be required at their hands. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58894:20"/>
Instances of Gods Judgments might be brought out of the Revelation of <hi>John</hi> against the great Whore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that a Man may speak as a Prophet (and be yet a Christian) of divers Calamities and Judgments which he cannot be active in, and yet not destroy his Christian Principle. Secondly, But if as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian only, and within the compass of a Christian Freedom, and understanding these aforesaid Passages are spoken; then I may lawfully conclude, that the design thereof was not to incite to <hi>Fighting Killing or Bloodshed,</hi> but rather that it was writ from a Belief that if they had eyed the Lord, and aimed at the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Oppression and Persecution, they might have been such a dread of Nations, as is expressed in the same Paper, that possibly they might not have met with such Resistance (if any) in that case; for who knows not that they were formidable for a time? And what success they might have had for such an end, our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary cannot determine. (However to require their Inquisition and to knock at <hi>Romes</hi> doors, proves no violence; all this might have been done by Embassies, as in the case of the D. of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that persecuted the poor <hi>Piedmontors</hi> the Stock of the <hi>Waldenses.</hi>) For he proves not an incitation unto Bloodshed and Slaughter in the said Papers, but only that they should have required the Innocent Blood that had been shed, after they had set up their Standard at <hi>Rome,</hi> according to what many of them had often promised, before they fell on persecuting and imprisoning our Friends; and herein they were reproved of breach of promise, that many of the old Army had made, not to lay down their Arms till they had set up their Standard at <hi>Rome,</hi> and broke down Oppression there. But on the contrary to fall upon Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing and Imprisoning Men for Conscience here, might they not justly from their own former pretences and promises be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, why do ye Imprison us, or suffer us to be Imprisoned? (As many were in the Protectors name and time) why do ye not go to <hi>Rome</hi> and break down the Popes Inquisitions, and in point of Justice require the Innocent Blood that has been shed by that persecuting Power? And might they not have required this as Magistrates, and seen what satisfaction would have been made, according to their own engagements? But when they set up Persecution in <hi>England,</hi> they lost their Power and Dread, and became Weak and Feeble, till the Lord overturned them. And yet though it 'cannot consist with our Christian Principle so
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58894:20"/>
much, as to avenge our selves, War with carnal Weapons, or incite others to War and Bloodshed: And <hi>G. F.</hi> (who is the Man chiefly struck at in this matter) even in <hi>Cromwel's</hi> days did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly testifie against Wars and Fighting, as also against Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and contriving Insurrections, and this both by Words, Writing and Suffering; and exhorted the Soldiers to do violence to no Man, neither accuse any Man falsely, and this in the same Paper wherein he reminds them of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. Howbeit there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains both Judgments and Vials of Wrath from God, in store for the Persecuting Whore, or Mystery <hi>Babylon,</hi> wherever she sits upon the many Waters, which are Peoples, and Multitudes, and Nations, and Tongues, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. and 18. Chapters. that has been drunk with the Blood of the Saints, and made both Nations and Kings drunk with the Wine of the Wrath of her Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And whether at <hi>Rome,</hi> or throughout all Christendom, that Spirit of Persecution cannot escape, nor they that joyn with it in acts of Cruelty, whether Papists or Protestants, Kings, Princes or People. But as for <hi>O. C.</hi> (and his Agents) though looked upon to be a Beast, yet he was not so serviceable a Beast or Horn, as those spoken of in the Revelations, chap. 17. 16. that shall hate the Whore, and make her desolate and naked; and shall eat her Flesh and burn her with Fire, because God hath put it into their Hearts to fulfil his Will, ver. 17. (too course a work for Saints and Lambs of Christ, and yet Gods Will it should be done.) Now to foresee or foretel such a Judgment to be of God is one thing, and to incite Men to Wars and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed is another: And this latter I affirm, stands not with the Principle nor Practice of the People called Quakers, nor do they declare themselves for <hi>Fighting,</hi> as they are most falsly accused. And as to the question, How should the Army set up their Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard at <hi>Rome,</hi> but by Fighting? There does lye a plain excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and certain Instances against the general State of this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Argument (which yet I bring not as comparative altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only with respect to that <hi>Dread,</hi> that was believed by some would have attended the old Army, had they been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the cause pretended, and gone to <hi>Rome</hi> for that end decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.) My exception is first in the case of <hi>Gideon,</hi> the Host of the <hi>Midianites</hi> fled and were overcome, and yet not by Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Gideons</hi> part, but by a mean Stratagem, as to outward appearance, <hi>viz.</hi> that of their Pitchers, Trumpets and Lamps;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58894:21"/>
but the hand of the Lord was in it, see <hi>Judg.</hi> 7. And secondly, in the case of <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> when the Children of <hi>Ammon, Moab</hi> and <hi>Mount-seir</hi> came against <hi>Judah,</hi> the Lord told them by his Prophet <hi>Jehaziel,</hi> be not afraid nor dismaid by reason of this great Multitude, for the Battel is not yours, but Gods, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 15. And did they then go against this great Army to fight them? No, but having first sought the Lord, they sung Praises to the beauty of Holyness; and when they began to sing, the Lord set ambushments against the Children of <hi>Ammon, Moab,</hi> &amp;c. see <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23. And its said concerning <hi>Barak, Jeptha, Sampson, David, Samuel</hi> and the Prophets, that by Faith they subdued Kingdoms, turned to flight the Armies of the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 11. 32. which therefore was not all by Fighting; but that there has a hand and power of God appeared in these things, and in Revolutions, most sorts will confess except Atheists.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>The Army was made the Sword of the Lord against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Bishops,</hi> M. H. T. S. <hi>and the Lord is represented Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with</hi> Olivers <hi>Sword,</hi> G. R.</p>
            <p>And what then? So the wicked are call'd his <hi>Sword, Psal.</hi> 17. 13. And <hi>O Assyrian the Rod of mine Anger,</hi> Isa. 10. 5. And <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> the King of <hi>Babylon my Servant,</hi> Jer. 25. 9. and 43. 10. See the places quoted. And also <hi>Jer.</hi> 49. 28. and 50. 17. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26. 7. and 29. 19. and 30. 10. So that sometimes God makes use of evil Men to execute such Judgments, as well as Men zealous and sincere for a good end therein.</p>
            <p>And also that Passage cited about <hi>inviting all Christians and Nations that are against Popery, to come against it,</hi> &amp;c. This is taken as looking somewhat Warlike; however had they so done, in all probability they had been so formidable and frightful to the Pope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he would have delivered up his Mitre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that there would have been the less occasion (if any) for War and Bloodshed. But says our Adversary, <hi>they gave Directions and Charges to the Protector and Officers and Soldiers concerning Fighting, exhorting thereunto,</hi> &amp;c. p. 13. I find no such Charge and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and I cannot believe it without more plain and direct evidence. As also that charge in his Book, so often cast upon us, <hi>viz. That they</hi> (viz. <hi>the Quakers</hi>) <hi>approve of what the Armies did against the King and his Party;</hi> which I affirm is utterly false, as stated, and especially as charged in general: For we rather
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58894:21"/>
have lamented that War and Bloodshed, as a National Calamity and Judgment for the Sins of the People. And though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, and our Adversaries cannot deny, that the Sword was one of Gods four Judgments upon Idolaters and Oppressors, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 21. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 17. and so justifiable as from God, whose Judgments are all just; yet it is possible Men may be Unrighteous and selfish therein, in killing and taking Possession, and so not justified in their immediate acting therein.</p>
            <p>That <hi>G. F.</hi> and many others concerned with him in the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jesus Christ, have not varyed from their Christian Testimony against Fighting, nor Temporized, Apostatized or been deceitful therein, further appears,</p>

            <p>Now considering his deep Suffering then, as also that he was then suspected to be as much for King <hi>Charles,</hi> as <hi>J. P.</hi> can suspect or insinuate that he was against him, and yet now to own and honour him, which is the great crime in this Adversaries evil Eye. But that he was then guilty of Plotting for the King, and now (in his owning the King in the civil Government) a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizer, are both alike unrighteous Calumnies and Forgeries of his, and our guilty and Persecuting Adversaries. But that he and others refused Preferments in the old Army, and to take up Arms in the Commonwealth's days against the King and his;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58894:22"/>
and our Testimony both then and now being to the Covenant of Peace, and against even the very occasion of Wars, to wit, Men's Lusts; these are true, and still do plainly evince our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Consistency with our selves and Christian Testimony, from the beginning, against all Plotting, carnal Wars and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Moreover be it remarked, that after <hi>G. F.</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> and was brought before <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> he said, That there was a People now gotten up or risen, that he could not win with Gifts, Honours, Offices, or places of Preferment, as he could all other Sects. To which <hi>G. F.</hi> answered, <hi>viz.</hi> That we have forsaken our own and are not like to receive any thing of him, nor the Glory of the World; and so he was not like to choke us with such things, as he had done all others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Observe here his and our faithful Friends faithfulness to our Christian and Gospel Testimony, and clearness from Tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing or aiming at worldly Interests, which is the character and design of Temporizers.</p>
            <p>Again, as to his hideous clamour against the Quakers, <hi>as far more guilty and more abominable in these matters, than any other Party what soever, whilst they so contumeliously upbraid others, and have done the same things themselves.</hi> This is a plain lie against the Quakers, considering that but a few lines before, <hi>p.</hi> 20. he tells the Readers, <hi>the Quakers reproach and rail on the Presbyterians and Independents, for their joyning to and abetting the late War, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Execution done upon the late King and his Party.</hi> Now that the Quakers have so done and joyned, is an apparent Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood before detected; and that the Quakers have so done, to wit, approved the execution done upon the late King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a most aggravating Falshood, to expose us to the severity of the Government, who were not then in being.</p>
            <p>Now Reader, judge what's the tending of all this our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries inveterate work against us, but to expose and render us obnoxious to the present King and Government, as possibly he can to ruin and destroy us, so directly contrary to his pretence, <hi>of abhorring that Practice;</hi> do but see the Man's gross Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, deadly Malice, and most base Temporizing, to bring us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into our Graves with contempt, if possible. Howbeit, as we fear not him, nor his Invectives, nor the Devil that old Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, that has set him on work: So we doubt not but through divine assistance, we shall still close to our Christian Testimony;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58894:22"/>
faithfully witnessing that Christ's Dispensation, Kingdom and Government among his People, is above Wars and Fighting, for it is established in Righteousness and Peace; and of the increase of his Government and Peace there shall be no end; but God will make Wars to cease to the ends of the Earth, and in <hi>Salem</hi> shall be his Tabernacle, where he breaketh the Bow and the Spear, and Weapons of War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we the People called Quakers, can in defiance of all Envy and Malice, stand up for Christ Jesus and his Kingdom, and still plead the same things that <hi>J. P.</hi> quotes out of our Friends Declarations to the King of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. and that with a good Conscience in the sight of God and Men, both what he cites out of Quakers Plea, 1661. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>No better Testimony can be given of us and of our peaceableness; and that we shall not Plot nor Rebel against the King, than experience it self; experience is the best wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that we are peaceable, and free from Plotting and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; for we have always been so since we were a People, both before and since the King came in.</q> As also a Declaration quoted by him, given forth in behalf of the whole Body of the elect People of God, who are called Quakers, and signed by, <hi>G. Fox</hi> and <hi>Richard Huberthorn, John Stubbs, Francis Howgill, Ger. Roberts, John Boulton, Leonard Fell, Samuel Fisher, Hen. Fell, John Hind, John Furley,</hi> Junior, <hi>Tho. Moore,</hi> these Names he has mentioned, to expose them to the World as Temporizers, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though Men far more Righteous than himself; and I am perswaded, most of them, if not all, more Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in what they say, than ever <hi>John Pennyman</hi> was, since he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained prejudice and envy: Hear what he has against these Men, as Temporizers (<hi>viz.</hi>) <q>That they have suffered, because they would not take up carnal Weapons to Fight withal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any; and made a prey upon, because they say, we are the Innocent Lambs of Christ; and cannot avenge our selves</q> [as he cites] and further in the Postcript, <q>All Wars and Fightings with carnal Weapons, we do deny, who have the Sword of the Spirit. Again, this the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers do witness (<hi>viz.</hi>) and this is both our Principle and Practice, and hath been from the beginning; so that if we suffer as suspected to take up Arms or make War against any, it is without any ground from us; for it neither is, or ever was in our Hearts, since we owned the Truth of God,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58894:23"/>
neither shall we ever do it, because it is contrary to the Spirit of Christ, his Doctrin, and the Practice of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Well, this Testimony we stand by, against all the contrary whatever; and do affirm it was conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously writ, and not from a Temporizing Spirit, as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary all along endeavours to insinuate, to prejudice and cloud our Christian Testimony.</p>
            <p>Again he cites these words to the King and Parliament, 1661. (<hi>viz.</hi>) <q>our Allegiance to the King, our Lives have and shall manifest to him;</q> and you, and all Men subscribed he saith, by <hi>George Fox, Edward Burroughs, Francis Howgill, John Crook, Samuel Fisher, Richard Huberthorn, John Whitehead, Samuel Thornton, Leonard Fell, John Boulton,</hi> and twenty more; and these he has ranked up for <hi>Temporizers, Dissemblers,</hi> &amp;c. having rendred all our Applications to the King of this kind, <hi>but Hypocrisie and Temporizing Deceits as not to be trusted,</hi> and this still to render us obnoxious; more especially if his Book be Printed; for see what he saith (not only to cloud, but to murder our Christian Testimony) (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>and yet under all these Dissimulations and Temporizings, do like the Whore in the</hi> Proverbs, <hi>wipe their Mouths, and proclaim themselves an innocent and harmless People;</hi> and near his Conclusion, charges <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, with a late fawning flattering Address to the King and Parliament. How now <hi>John,</hi> is this thy <hi>abhorring to render us obnoxious to the Government?</hi> God will smite thee, thou malicious Hypocrite; our Innocency shall out-live thy Envy and causeless Revenge, and rise up in Judgment against thee. What wilt thou be still be mad against us, because our Friends gave Testimony against the <hi>Man</hi> that attempted to burn the Bible, among other Books at the <hi>Exchange?</hi> And wilt thou be still revengful, because some were moved to testifie against thy extravagancy and rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous work, with thy twenty seven Venison Pasties (or so esteemed) exposed to the Multitude?</p>
            <p>And was not this thy wedding Dinner for Jews and Gentiles, whom thou hadst invited to <hi>Merchant-Taylors</hi>-Hall? And what was thy intended Mystery in all this? Answer plainly, for it was a very publick Frolick, and whether or no had not the Bible been burned, if the Officer at the Exchange had not prevented? be plain, and do not always smite at others and hide thy self; nor put us off, with telling us, <hi>Thou wouldest not do it at the Will of any
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58894:23"/>
Mortal:</hi> What immortal one would move any to attempt it? An immortal God, or an <hi>immortal</hi> Devil? Couldst thou imagin that the immortal God would ever move to it? And what moved thee now thus to vent thy Malice and Clamour, not only against the People called Quakers in general, but also against many particular Persons by Name, the meanest of them more Righteous than thy self? Dost thou not know that <hi>Edw. Burrough, Fr. Howgill, Sam. Fisher, R. Hubberthorn, Joh. Stubbs, Edw. Piott, George Bishop, George Rose</hi> and <hi>Miles Hallhead</hi> are all deceased? Yea, some of them many Years in their Graves, who dyed Prisoners, sufferers for their Consciences towards God, and yet thou wilt rank them among Temporizers: Oh unrighteous Man! is thy Conscience wholly seared, since thy Essay towards the burning of the Bible? for thou hast as little Recourse or Regard to the Scriptures, or Truth's Principle in thy Writing (though once professed by thee) as thou hast to Conscience; which is none at all in sincerity: Malice and the Gall of Bitterness has swallowed thee up, and Darkness is become thy Habitation. Dost thou not remember that <hi>Fr. Howgill,</hi> dyed in Prison, and that both <hi>E. B. R. H.</hi> and others were Prisoners when taken sick, and dyed? And dost thou not know that not only <hi>Sam. Fisher</hi> but <hi>John Crook, John Boulton,</hi> and many others, have been great Sufferers since the King's Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and must all these be now infamously ranked among Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizers, Dissemblers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is this thy Conscience and Charity <hi>John Pennyman?</hi> And is thy Malice so great against <hi>William Deus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> so that thou must needs endeavour to expose him to the Displeasure of the present Government, to add Afflictions to his Bonds, who is known to be a sincere, upright, peaceable Man, and great Sufferer, both in the Time of the late and present Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yea and in present Suffering and Confinement for his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and Testimony. And what Hurt has honest <hi>Tho. Salthouse</hi> done thee, that thou must needs go about to expose him too? And also <hi>Isaac Pennington,</hi> who is known to be an Innocent Harmless Man, and hath been a great Sufferer, even under the present Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? What, would not thy Malice suffer thee to let him alone, but thou must needs render him obnoxious for writing something to the Parliament and Army? printed 1659. about their backslid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and turning aside from the <hi>Good Old Cause,</hi> &amp;c. And to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Business against him, thou puttest the Question, Was not then the Armies Cause just in his Opinion, and their Fighting Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58894:24"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 17. How now, <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> hast thou neither a regard to Men nor Truth? Hast thou done as thou wouldest be done by, thus to expose Men, and question them for that which thou thy self darest not adventure openly to oppose? Therefore I would ask thee, What is thy Opinion concerning that Cause called <hi>the Good Old Cause,</hi> to wit, <hi>Liberty to tender Consciences, removing Oppression, and preserving Men's Properties,</hi> formerly pretended to in the Old Army, though not well mannaged and pursued, was this Cause pretended to, just; yea or nay, in it self? Why dost thou cover thy Deceit, desert Truth in any Case, and peevishly expose Conscientious Men, for formerly confessing it? One Passage to the Parliament and Common-wealth 1657. Let the Reader a little take notice of it; for perhaps he may smile at <hi>John Pennyman</hi>'s Design in citing it. The Passage, as he cites it, runs thus, p. 28. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Let all these Abbey-Lands, Gleab-Lands that is given to the Priests, be given to the Poor of the Nation, and let all the Great Houses, Abbies, Steeple-houses and <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> be for Alms-Houses, (or some other use) for all the Blind and Lame to be there.</q> What could be <hi>J. P</hi>'s Design in citing this Passage? If it was to make the King and Court angry with our Friends, for advising to make <hi>White-Hall</hi> an Alms-house for the Blind and Lame (as that seems most likely to be his Design) I dare say he will miss of it; for I am perswaded the King would have been better pleased, and thought it more Charitable, that his House should have been an Alms-house for the Poor, Blind and Lame, than that <hi>Oliver and his Crew should there</hi> set up <hi>their Nests, pamper, feed and gluttonize themselves;</hi> for the Humility, serious Praying and Tears were lost when they had killed and taken pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, were got to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and there settled at Ease in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, pride and idleness, even while many innocent Men were deep Sufferers for their tender Consciences in cold noisom Goals, Holes and Dungeons, with Bread and Water, their Victuals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing snatched from them, their Bed-cloaths taken from them by Force, and they forced to lye upon Straw in cold low dark Goals, for above a Year together. In these and such like Sufferings I my self, with many others of our Friends had a deep share in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Days, and that under Presbyterians and Independents, I affirm; and yet they have not manifested Repentance, nor made Satisfaction. <hi>J. P.</hi> has taken share, and deeply drunk in that persecuting Spirit; and to aggravate his Matter against us on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58894:24"/>
their behalf, he has that Passage reflecting upon the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists twice over, cited in his Preface from our <hi>Pen</hi> (as his Phrase is) quoting, <hi>Quakerism a new Nick name:</hi> As also in p. 27. he has the same Passage over again, with another out of <hi>William Penn</hi>'s Book, styled, <hi>A just Rebuke to one and twenty Divines,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding the Presbyterians of their former Proceedings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that he appears so much disgusted at a Reflection upon the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he begins and almost concludes his invective and bitter piece about it, as offended that they were upbraided; such a deeply concerned and zealous Presbyterian Agent is <hi>John</hi> become.</p>
            <p>I may give the Reader a hint of one Fling that <hi>John</hi> has at me, if he had had Sedition or Treason against me, to be sure I should have heard of it, and many more besides. His Fling is this, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>F. B. who</hi> (he saith) <hi>was one of the chief Preachers of the Quakers, and in very great esteem among them—This Man is charged, by</hi> Jer. Ives, <hi>to have justified the late War against the King, and is defended by</hi> George Whitehead, <hi>another of their chief Preachers,</hi> p. 9. To all which I answer, as a Man not Conscious to my self herein. Do but see how fallaciously and deceitfully the matter is stated by this peevish Incendiary; as namely, upon his repeating the Anabaptists charging <hi>E. B. with justifying the late War against the King</hi> (without any Distinction he addeth) <hi>and is defended by</hi> G. W. which looks like as if I do defend such a Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the late War against the King. What is this but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Wickedness, to render me obnoxious and seditious to the Government, and so uncapable of so much as the Act of Indemnity? As for a present defending of that War, which I never was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in, nor is there any Words of that import in my answer to <hi>Ives</hi> (<hi>see <hi>Serious Search</hi>
               </hi>) which <hi>John</hi> quotes, but leaves out the principal Matter wherein I defend <hi>E. B.</hi> in his testifying against the Men then in Power, and the Quakers from <hi>Ives</hi> his most unjust Accusation against them in these general Words, <hi>viz. You justifie the late War against the King: What Impostors,</hi> &amp;c. This our Adversary has most enviously seconded, as one behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Anabaptist Preachers; and was not he a zealous Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, more than a little concerned in the Old Army, against the King himself? who not very long after his open scurrilous Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, boasting, vapouring and malicious Work against us, was soon cut off by Death. Now <hi>J. P.</hi> has enlarged upon his Work
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58894:25"/>
against us, to render us odious to the Government; and me in particular, as <hi>defending such a Justification of the late Wars against the King;</hi> as his Words may be easily taken, rather than defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Friend or Friends from that Charge which not only my self, but also many thousands of us and among us are wholly clear of, (nor did I ever like Wars and Blood-shed) being a simple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted harmless People towards the King and all Men, and do eye the over-ruling Hand and Power of God, and dayly fear him, for our Preservation being in his Holy Will resigned to be patient and passive under what Government he is pleased to set up.</p>
            <p>Moreover, let the Reader please to take notice how evident <hi>John Pennyman</hi>'s Abuse, Deceit and Falshood is, on some Passages he cites out of a Paper, entituled, <hi>A Declaration from the People called Quakers to the present distracted Nation of</hi> England, 1659. p. 12. where, upon these Passages, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>We have chosen the Son of God to be our King, and he hath chosen us to be his People, and he might command thousands and ten thousands of his Saints, at this Day, to fight in his own Cause—and give them Victory over all their Enemies, and turn his Hand upon their Persecutors; but yet his Kingdom is not of this World, neither is his War-fare with Carnal Weapons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither hath he chosen us for that End; neither can we yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he will make use of us in that way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—But for the present we are given up to bear and suffer all things for his Name's sake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Upon which <hi>John Pennyman</hi> has this Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>viz. So that they were not then of that Mind, That the Spirit would never move them to fight:</hi> And this he brings to contradict their Declaration to the King 1660. <q>Testifying that the Spirit of Christ which leads them into all Truth, will never move them to fight and war against any Man with outward Weapons.</q>
            </p>
            <p>1. In the first place, I intreat all that read this, to take notice, That the aforesaid Declaration which <hi>J. P.</hi> has the said Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon, (<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Quakers were not then of that Mind, That the Spirit would never move them to fight</hi>) was (as he saith, true) subscribed by many, but tells not the Reader, That he, even <hi>John Pennyman</hi> himself, was one of those many who subscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: As I am sure his own Name is to it, with thirteen or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen more; wherein he hath dealt most disingenuously and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58894:25"/>
thus to reflect upon the Quakers and <hi>E. B.</hi> about it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any notice how far himself was concerned in it by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription; which he must needs see and call to mind, if his Malice did not befool him to overlook (or not heed) the Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but his casting it upon <hi>E. B.</hi> as being moved by his Spirit to give that Paper forth, shews that he has of late looked on the Conclusion of it; it being there said, That the Substance of this was given forth the twentieth Day of this tenth Month <note n="‖" place="margin">1659.</note>; being moved of the Lord, by his Spirit thereunto, through <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi> and is now judged meet to be published to the Nation, in the behalf of us and our Friends, under our Hands, <hi>viz.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>See now, here is <hi>J. Pennyman</hi> among the rest, espousing and highly owning the Declaration aforesaid, as the Substance of it being then given forth, at the Motion of the Lord by his Spirit, and published in the behalf of them who subscribed it, and their Friends: Well, I have seriously perused the said Declaration, and I must confess it looks so impartially, and with so much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Freeness from a fighting Spirit, and so plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing our Choice of the Son of God to be our King, and his Choice of us to be a People, and that his Kingdom is not of this World; and that his War-fare is not with Carnal Weapons, as also that neither is his Victory by the murthering and killing of Men's Persons, nor hath he chosen us for that end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with divers other Passages to the same purpose, as in p. 8. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>We do not war against any with Carnal Weapons, neither shall we ever provoke the Nation against us, otherwise than by our Righteous and Holy Walking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:58894:26"/>That I wonder <hi>J. Pennyman</hi> should have or allow of such a Construction upon the said Declaration, as, That the Quakers were not then of that Mind, That the Spirit would never move them to fight: Unless <hi>John</hi> himself had such a Reserve, when he signed that Paper; which if he had, it was most gross Dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to tell the World, That he, with the rest, had chosen the Son of God to be their King; and that his War-fare is not with Carnal Weapons, nor his Victory by killing Men's Persons; nor hath he chosen us for that end. Now if <hi>J. P.</hi> when he signed this, believed that the Spirit of Christ might, for all this, move him (or any of them) to fight; What abominable Hypocrisy was he guilty of therein?</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To proclaim to the World, That he and the rest are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come subjects to such a King, as will never allow them to fight.</item>
               <item>2. And yet have this private Reserve, That he may move him to fight: But I am perswaded the rest of the Signers of the said Paper had no such deceitful Reserve; If <hi>J. P.</hi> had, he was very deceitful, and has now bewrayed the foulness of his own Nest.</item>
            </list>
            <p>As for the Words he carps at in the said Paper, to which his own Name is, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Son of God might command thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands and ten thousands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That's no Proof that they then believed he would do it; unless it must be taken for granted, That because he had Power to command thousands to fight, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would do it, and so argue from his Power to his Will, which but mean Logicians would be ashamed of; when it is as plainly told, That Christ's Kingdom is not of this World, and his Warfare is not with Carnal Weapons; and that he has not chosen us for that End, as to kill Men's Persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As that Christ by Prayer could have obtained more than twelve Legions of Angels to have rescued him:<note place="margin">Matth. 26. 53, 54.</note> But how then should the Scripture be fulfilled, That he must suffer?</p>
            <p>As for the other Words, <q>Neither can we yet believe that he (<hi>viz.</hi> the Son of God) will make use of us in that way (<hi>viz.</hi> of fighting).</q> For our Adversary to infer from the Particle <hi>yet,</hi> (where 'tis intimated, That <hi>yet</hi> they could not believe that Christ would move them to fight) that therefore the Quakers were not then of that Mind, That he would never move them to fight. He
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58894:26"/>
might as well have inferred, from their saying, That <hi>yet</hi> his Kingdom <hi>is</hi> not of this World: Therefore they were <hi>not</hi> then of the Mind, That Christ's Kingdom would never be of this World, but that it might become a worldly Kingdom, and his Servants turn Fighters. Thus absurd is our Adversary's Consequence against us, upon a mere small Circumstance or Ambiguity of a Word; <hi>yet</hi> [<hi>nevertheless</hi>] is construed by him for yet [as yet] as putting the signification of <hi>adhuc</hi> for <hi>tamen.</hi> And for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent we are given up to bear and suffer all things for his Names sake: As for the Word <hi>present,</hi> I grant, if it had been left out, it had appeared more absolute in concurrence with the Substance of the Declaration, which, as 'tis said, was given forth by <hi>E. B.</hi> But that diminutive Phrase (for the present) is not essential to the Substance of it, but rather to the manner of speaking: <hi>John,</hi> it may be, can give account of those Particles, which he has construed so much to the Disadvantage of the whole; seeing his Name is to the Paper, and he can give or own such an Interpretation of it as that they (the Quakers) were not then of that Mind, That the Spirit would never move them to fight, though there be enough in the Paper to evince the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as is before hinted: And if <hi>John</hi> had any such Reserve, in espousing and signing the said Paper, or did cause the putting in those Words, as that the Spirit of Christ might move him to fight, it is high Time for him to write a Recantation for that and many other Passages; wherein, while he endeavours to render us su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious and obnoxious to the Government, he has greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed his own dark, envious and perfideous Spirit, whose Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Method in his Book, generally is to snarle, snatch and catch at such Passages in our Friends Books, as he thinks most to make Advantage of, to render us Temporizers, odious and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the present Government, and commonly to pass by and leave out such Passages, Threats and Prophecies as were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against the former Men in Power, and their Oppressions and Cruelties that were inflicted in the Protector's Days. But as for the aforesaid Declaration to the distracted Nation of <hi>England,</hi> subscribed as aforesaid, 'tis so Impartial and Plain, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Oppressions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the several Governments in this Nation, lamenting the Judgments and Calamities thereof, that I wish he had published it all to the Nation, for it would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much have tended to clear our Innocency from his unjust Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58894:27"/>
and Insinuations against us as a People. And to manifest our clearness from Temporizing and Parties; and our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against Fighting, Warring and Killing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Christ's Government and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And now pray further consider, did not our Lord Jesus Christ in his Parable concerning them <hi>that Intreated the King's Servants spightfully and slew them, acknowledge the Justice of his Father, in sending forth</hi> his <hi>Armies, and destroying those Murderers, and burning of their City?</hi> Mat. 22. 7. and also against those Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen who slew the Heir, whom the Lord miserably destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 7. and <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 14. were not these Parables against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the Jews who persecuted and slew the Prophets of God, and his Son Christ the Heir? Did not he therein Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and of the destruction thereof, and so far recognize that War, and miserable Destruction that came upon them, as a just judgment from God? and yet his Kingdom being not of this World, his Servants might not fight, being under an Injunction to the contrary; was Christ therein contradictory to himself or to his Testimony, for his Servants not fighting? no sure. And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledged the Magistrate or Rulers place, as owning his Office in not bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sword in vain, but as being the Minister of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. and yet exhorted his Brethren the Saints, not to avenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but rather give place unto Wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19. did the Apostle herein contradict himself or his Christian Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? pray consider it.</p>
            <p>Now suppose a Government (according to their own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) in one Nation, should require their Subjects or Friends innocent Blood unjustly shed, in another Nation by Murders, Massacres, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would not this be just, and may not God in vindictive Justice and Judgment, stir up a Power or Government, (whose Principle is accordingly) to such an act, as he did the Romans against <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the persecuting Jews? And for any of his Servants so far to recognize the same, as a just Judgment; how do they therein either contradict their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Principle, which is, <hi>not to avenge themselves,</hi> nor to use carnal and destroying Weapons, either for Christ's Kingdom, or the Kingdoms of this World? as being unsuitable Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Christ's <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Sheep</hi> to make use of, whatever
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58894:27"/>
use God in Judgment may cause or suffer to be made thereof among Nations in the Fall; it is not consistent with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gospel of Christ, or nature of his Lambs, Sheep, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Followers and Sufferers, to make use of the devouring Sword, to destroy others who cannot defend themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and therefore is it not more just and warrantable for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (who have a Power, and the Sword of Justice) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>Sheep</hi> of Christ, yea Nations and People (so far as their power extends) from devouring Beasts of Prey, rather then to persecute, oppress or suffer them to be devoured by any others, who seek their ruin? And yet we hope for the fulfilling of those Evangelical Prophecies that foretel the end of Wars, Strife and Contention, and Christ's Kingdom of Peace to be set up and exalted to the ends of the Earth: <hi>Send Peace in our times O Lord.</hi>

P.</hi>) The matter he intends for an Oath lies in these words, <hi>viz. I do hereby testifie in the Truth of my Heart, and in the presence of him that knows all things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that I have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this contract, sold or engaged the said Estate, to or with any Person,</hi> &amp;c. which being given under <hi>Hand and Seal,</hi> in the presence of two Witnesses; our Adversary concludes it a Form of an Oath (and has made a hideous clamour about this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) <hi>according to the Quakers own definition of an Oath,</hi> quoting a second Testimony concerning Oaths, 1675. p. 3, 4, 5. <hi>viz. that these Forms of Speeches used by the Apostles, and by</hi> Jacob <hi>and</hi> Laban <hi>are of themselves (without the addition of somewhat more, as

an outward Sign or Pledge) neither Oath or Swearing, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more as an outward Sign or Pledge, was that which gave the denomination of an Oath or Swearing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As to the words [<hi>one of the Forms of the Quakers Oaths</hi>] this is a deceitful Aspersion, containing a two-fold Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, <hi>1st.</hi> That the Quakers do use Oaths or Swearing. <hi>2dly.</hi> That they use several Forms of Oaths or Swearing, and this from a particular or private act not of the Quakers, but of <hi>one call'd a Quaker,</hi> which whether that was an Oath or not, wee'll enquire anon. <hi>3dly.</hi> That accusation that <hi>S. C. Imposed upon and forced him (though with dissatisfaction) to sign and seal his Testimony.</hi> This <hi>S.

And now to come more closely to the cause alledged against us, to prove us Swearers, or guilty of useing Forms of Oaths.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. In the passage before cited are two actions of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent natures, Religious and Civil, which must be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; if a faithful Friend without scrupling his Confession, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the substance of the old Oath, had been sufficient; otherwise his Hand and Seal, engaging both himself and his was added. This is the same we offer to the Magistrate; if unfaithful, we engage the penalty of the Law against Perjury. His Hand and Seal was not an outward Sign or Pledge to make it an Oath, but to make the Penalty legal, as a witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, to those to whom his verbal Confession could not, without them and other Witnesses extend nor appear effectual. To confirm our Assertion, that some outward Sign gives the denomination of Swearing (which <hi>some outward Sign,</hi> or <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more is</hi> not <hi>any (or every) thing more</hi>) and that the Apostle's words and others, were but Asseverations; see the Testimonies in our Treatise of Oaths of <hi>Basil Nazianzen,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 61, 65, 18. Bishop <hi>Sanderson de Jur. oblig.</hi> about pag. 141, 142. and others there. If the Party were a real Friend he confessed, if not, he engaged; besides we have more fully defined an Oath, and the particular Ceremonies thereof, than what our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cites amounts to, in our Book in answer to <hi>I. S.</hi> entituled, <hi>The case of the Quakers concerning Oaths defended as Evangelical.</hi> 
                  <q>As first, concluding that only saying, <hi>God is my Witness,</hi> Rom. 1. 9. <hi>I say the Truth in Christ, I lie not,</hi> Rom. 9. 1. <hi>And calling God to Witness to the Truth of what we say,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:58894:28"/>
are no Oaths; we cannot be convinced that any of these, make up a formal Oath among Christians: And then we give the definition of an Oath, as used among Men, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That first there is Swearing by the great God intended. <hi>2dly.</hi> Ab Imprecation or Curse contained. <hi>3dly.</hi> Some Ceremony or Sign used, see <hi>Case of the Quakers concerning Oaths defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> p. 6.</q> And then for the several Ways or Ceremonies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing formal Swearing, they are signified thus, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>Among the Heathen, laying the Hands upon the Altars and Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Gods, <hi>Jurare aras, Horace. Abraham</hi>'s Servant putting his Hand under his Thigh, <hi>Gen</hi> 24. 2. and 47. 29. The Angel lifting up his Hand towards Heaven. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christians laying the Hand upon a Bible and kissing it, or Swearing upon the four Evangelists, according to the Pope's Imposition, p. 7.</q> So that the <hi>somewhat else</hi> is here restrained to such and such Ceremonies respectively, and here limited, and not in general to <hi>any</hi> or <hi>every</hi> thing used in civil Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not intending or belonging to it, to the making it an Oath; as that of the Hand and Seal is a Testimony to the Writing, to be a true Record of his Confession, both as a civil Man, and also Religious. And therefore also an obligation to restitution is faulty, both by the arbitrement and censure of the Religious, if brought before them; and also of the civil, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, if before such, and Courts of Justice also: If not, it is through their defect, not admitting a Testimony without Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and granting Restitution in case of Couzenage, which we consider not; as when we bring Witnesses, or are brought as Witnesses before them, or offer our Service in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; it's their fault in refusing our just offer, not ours in refusing their unjust one. If it was <hi>I. P.</hi> (or suppose such an one) had <hi>S. C.</hi> acted the wise Man, in taking his Confession without such record with Hand and Seal? nay it seems he had more than ordinary confidence in the Man, that he so much valued his Affirmation, and every engagement that Men make under Hand and Seal (though God's Name be mentioned therein) is not therefore an Oath. For are the last Wills and Testaments of the deceased, Oaths or Swearing; which are made and begun [In the Name of God Amen] and confirmed with Hand and Seal? Are these Oaths, or estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58894:29"/>
the Oaths of the deceased, because mention is made of the Name of God, and Hand and Seal to them? If Hand and Seal to any contract or promise (wherein possibly some <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ccasionally have made mention of the Name of God (which we are very tender of using) make it an Oath, I confess this is a new definition of an Oath.

                  <hi>He writes to them in one Paper as followeth,</hi> Wrastle not with Flesh and Blood, ye Christians, for it is the Practice of Heathens, Apostates and Jews; but overcome Evil with Good, receive Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and not kill them, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 48.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And in p.</hi> 41. Can you stop the Vials and the Plagues that are to come upon the Persecutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can you refuse the Cup of the Wrath of the Almighty, when it is given to you, can you turn your Mouths and Heads aside, for not drinking of it?</p>

                  <hi>And in p.</hi> 31. The Apostles were Spiritual, and wrastled not with Flesh and Blood, they had the Mind of Christ, that destroyed Death and the Devil, the Power of Death; but you have disobeyed it, that persecutes your Brethren, the Christians, to Death; you are not in the High Power of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but you are in the Power that hates and destroys the Creatures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of the Love of God to Enemies; and these will wrastle with Flesh and Blood, being in the Power of Darkness, the Devil's Work, and so defaces the Creature, and doth not bring it into the Liberty of the Sons of God; these should be ashamed of their Work before the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For whom he sends he arms (<hi>but this is not carnal</hi>) but your Day is come of Tryal, the Day is come of Christendoms Tryal.</p>
