         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT VERTVOVS, HIGH, AND MIGHTIE PRINCE, King IAMES, our dread Soueraigne, by the grace of God, King of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> defender of the faith, &amp;c. long life, happie daies, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous raigne.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt gracious and dread Soueraigne Lord, I haue not preſumed vpon this dedication, as being ouertaken with the forgetfulnes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of your Maieſties greatnes, or mine owne pouertie: For I confeſſe, that if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon were made that way, I might wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily be blamed of preſumption. But the truth is, that I laid in balance your mind rather then your Maieſtie, and the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather then my penning of it. In this I confeſſe I preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and I truſt without deſert of blame, that as you haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred godlines before glorie in the middeſt of this glorie which God hath brought you vnto: ſo you will preferre a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of godlines, thus ſimply furniſhed, before a glorious ſtile. Which is not ſeldome repugnant to the ſimplicitie of holie things. And yet my meaning is to confeſſe to your Maieſtie, that this argument deſerued both a more learned and more gracious penne then mine. To which I would with al my heart haue giuen place, if I had either ſeene before me, or heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde me the footſteps of any tending that way that I goe, though I confeſſe, there are ſome to bee ſeene trauailing in waies neere adioyning to this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16851:3"/>Concerning your Maieſtie, I am perſwaded, that you repoſe your greateſt greatnes in the communion of Saints, and not in your ſeuered calling which is tranſitorie: and therefore will account your ſelfe honoured by the augmentation of grace, and the furtherance of true holines. Your Maieſties owne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires muſt be permitted to inioy their opportunities, and your godly wiſedome to inioy your choice in this varietie of reading. But I doubt not, but your godly heart will perſwade you to receiue a booke of this kinde with a gracious hand, though it were to no other end, but to begin to Gods people in the entertaining of any true hearted motiue vnto holines. And this to ſay the truth, is that wherein I haue made bold to vſe your gracious and renowmed name, to aduantage my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of furthering the people committed to your charge in their paſſage to ſaluation. Let it therefore (I moſt humblie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate) pleaſe your Maieſtie to giue allowance to my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and drift, and to pardon my ſlips: for my meaning hath been to ſeeke the honour of God in this work, and to borrow helpe in this Dedication, of the grace he hath giuen you for ſuch purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Thus reioycing, with the reſt of Gods people, for the comfort wherewith the Churches heart is comforted by you, and deſiring the lineall deſcent of theſe kingdomes to your Maieſties royall poſteritie, till Ieſus Chriſt with his glorious comming obſcure all the glorie of the world, I beſeech the holie Ghoſt to be with your ſpirit, and keepe your Maieſtie in Chriſt vnto the end.</p>

               <note place="margin">Luk. 16.8.</note> The truth hereof may appeare in the Papiſts; who diſcerning that their bookes of Controuerſies, ſtuffed with manifold vntruths, fallacians, and corruptions, were not able to gaine ſufficiently (though ſmall gaine be too great for ſuch merchants) to their Babyloniſh kingdome,<note place="margin">Reuel. 18.15.</note>

In this reſpect I perſwade my ſelfe, it is come to paſſe (not without the gracious prouidence of God) that the author hereof hath been incouraged in himſelfe, and by others, to write theſe Chriſtian directions, as a counterpoyſon to all ſuch inchauntments of Papiſts, who would by theſe meanes beare men in hand, that al true deuotion dwelt amongſt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and were incloſed and tyed to their Cels and Cloyſters: In which vncleane cages it is vnpoſsible for any true ſpirituall and holy meditations to haue their abiding: for as much as euen the very mindes and conſciences of ſuch vncleane birds,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> are defiled with damnable errors, and Idolatries. Wherefore I would earneſtly aduiſe, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely intreate thee (Chriſtian Reader) to imbrace this booke, wherein thou ſhalt finde good precepts, and holy directions, not deliuered by rote (as from a Parrat) out of the bookes and writings of other men: but confirmed by the ſingular experience of one, who hath long laboured the conuerſion, and confirmation of many other; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the mortification and quickning of his owne ſoule and conſcience: one, whom indeed I haue euer eſteemed another <hi>Greenham:</hi> and herein more happie then he; becauſe he hath liued to penne, and peruſe his owne labours, and may yet liue (by the mercie of God) to correct and amend whatſoeuer ſlip of his penne (for in a long worke one may happily take a nap, two, or three) ſhall be ſhewed vnto him. Reade it therefore (beloued Chriſtian) and that with diligence: and thou ſhalt finde (I doubt not) more true light and direction to a true deuout and holy life, then in all the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the Ieſuiticall Father <hi>Parſons</hi> (though neuer ſo refined, as a brick newly waſhed) or meditations of Frier <hi>Granatenſis,</hi> or any Popiſh Directories whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

Among all (I may ſay with the Prophet and the Apoſtle) this is chiefe, that God hath ſo cleerely <hi>ſhewed his word to Iacob, his ſtatutes and his iudgements to Iſrael; and hath committed to vs his holy oracles:</hi> Wherein I meane not only that we haue the Goſpell ſo publikly and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully preached, which (though great) is common to vs with many: but withall, that in ſome admirable manner, God hath reuealed his ſecrets vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, ſuch as wee know no Church vpon the earth, in which the true ſenſe of the Scriptures and ſound doctrine thereof, are more ſincerely embraced and profeſſed. Yea with what ſtore of rare and excellent lights the Lord hath furniſhed this our Church, he is blind that ſeeth not, and malitious that wil not acknowledge it: wherein though generally it falleth out by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailtie and Sathans ſubtiltie, that there is more light of iudgement, then integritie of conſcience; yet herein God hath not left himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out witnes of many worthie Chriſtians both Preachers and profeſſors of the truth, who liuely expreſſe the forme of holie doctrine into which they are caſt, ſuch as vpon my vttermoſt perill I dare profeſſe, the deuouteſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt neither hath nor poſſiblie (in that profeſſion) can attaine vnto, lacking true faith the right mother and nurſe of a godly life. And herein to giue one inſtance in ſteed of many, take and examine ſtreightly this one work, and if it breathe not out more ſound godlines in one leafe, then all their artificiall compoſed treatiſes of Reſolution (which in their eſtimation are chiefe in this argument of a godly life) let me beare my deſerued blame. I leaue the life of the writer of that Popiſh booke to ſuch as ſeeme vpon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge to haue ſet out the ſame. And for the Author of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, I may not in modeſtie ſay what I know, but could and doe deſire that his life were ſo knowne to all, to whom his writing ſhall come, as it is to ſuch, who haue heard the doctrine and ſeene the practiſe hereof in himſelf theſe well neere thirtie yeeres. But to ſpare the perſon for his life time, and to foretell what you ſhall finde in his labours. In my ſimple opinion it might in one principal reſpect be called the Anatomie of the ſoule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not onely the great and principall parts are laid open, but euery veine and little nerue are ſo diſcouered, that wee may as it were, with the eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, as the right conſtitution of the whole and euery part of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;
<pb facs="tcp:16851:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo the manifold defects and imperfections thereof. Whereto be added moſt approoued remedies for the curing of all ſpirituall diſeaſes, with like preſeruatiues to maintaine our health, in ſuch ſort as may be enioyed in this contagious ayre, and ſo in a ſecond reſpect may be called the phyſicke of the ſoule. In both which how welcome it ſhall be to all that loue their ſoules health, I neede not doubt: onely I would deſire the Chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, not to be offended with the largenes of the work (as too deare for the poore, and too much to be read ouer in long time) but conſider with me, that if the arte of bodily phyſicke be ſo long, as the father of that arte teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth; then is it no marueile, that this ſpirituall phyſicke doth as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the other in length, as it doth in dignitie. And yet for the reliefe of ſuch as deſire to profit by his labour, great care hath been taken ſo to ſet out apart euery ſeuerall matter, that by the helpe of the Table they may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the particulars, which I perſwade my ſelfe will be ſo farre from glutting any, though neuer ſo weake ſtomacke, that it will rather procure him a better appetite. For ſimply to ſay, as I feele, I haue not read in any mans writing a more ſauourie ſtile and better reliſhed.

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, I am conſtrained in commending this ſpirituall bleſsing vnto thee, to begin with the excuſe of a good deed. For although it be a good deede to commend this commendable worke, yet muſt I plead the pardon of my defectiuenes in doing it, by alleaging my calling thereto; and impleade the fulſomnes of the maligners of ſuch holy enterpriſes, who for the moſt part diſtaſt all things but vanitie.<note place="margin">Iob. 34.3.</note> 
               <hi>The eare</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elihu) trieth words, as the mouth taſteth meate,</hi> to wit, if the eare be truly ſpirituall; otherwiſe there is an vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed eare,<note place="margin">Act. 7.51.</note> where there is an vncircumciſed heart: and he that hath an vnmortified eare, which is an affection to carnall eloquence, cannot eſcape a reprobate ſenſe in iudging of the wiſedome of God. An itching eare requireth a clawing ſtile, and the moſt readers ſeeke after that which this treatiſe purpoſely eſchueth. <hi>But wiſedome will be iuſtified of her children,</hi> and the godly hearted will lay that vnlooked for imputation vpon affectation of braue words, which the holy Ghoſt laieth vpon wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens brauerie, mentioned in the <hi>3.</hi> of <hi>Eſay,</hi> which ſoone after in the <hi>4.</hi> chap. verſ. <hi>4.</hi> by paſſage of ſpeech he calleth <hi>the filthines of the daughters of Sion.</hi> Something I graunt may be yeelded by way of indulgence to the weake; but he that ſeriouſly ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Lord, will not be offended nor cloyed with that ſimplicitie, which offendeth not God by turning away the mind by trifles from a bent purpoſe of ſound edification.</p>
            <p>The matter of this booke is right worthy to occupie the minds of men, and will be receiued of the gracious peruſers of it. The reſt of the profeſſors, which like wanton and full fed children begin to play with their meate, &amp; brooke nothing but conceited writing and ſpeaking, are to be bewailed; and as for the dogs they are to be deteſted and denied holy things. The bleſsing and comfort of grace brought S. <hi>Paul to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all things as dung,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 3.8.</note> in compariſon; and their illumination (how great ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer) is vnſanctified, which are not ſo minded: and if any man loue godlines indeed and be good mettall,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.17.</note> he will bleſſe the fire which is ordained to melt him, and the mould which is made to caſt him in: but they which make the founder to melt in vaine,<note place="margin">Iere. 6.29.30.</note> ſhall be called reprobate ſiluer. It is part of the bleſsing of a worke to bee wrought by a bleſſed inſtrument: and although it be ſacrilege to interuert the praiſe of God; yet it is of religion to take notice of Gods choſen veſſels, and all men are more affected by ſuch. This is the aduantage of this booke, I meane the long approued god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the Author, as he is a Chriſtian; and his zealous painfulnes, as he is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And if it pleaſe God that his pen may be as his tongue hath been, a tree of life, the very leaues thereof will cure him of the ſting of Serpents tongues. That which <hi>S.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N ſo great varietie of all learning, as God hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed this age withall, it were not onely needleſſe, but arrogancie and follie, for me to put any in hope, that I goe about to teach that, which hath not been taught, and ſet foorth alreadie by godly and learned brethren. But yet, leaſt any ſhould thinke my labour vaine, in that which I enterpriſe, I would all ſuch might vnderſtand, that howſoeuer I ſhall bring no other thing, then ſome haue, in generall, or in ſome part heretofore pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; yet they ſhall not be glutted with the ſame thing in particular, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they reſpect the treatiſe and argument it ſelfe, or the manner of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and proſecuting the ſame. At leaſtwiſe, I may ſay, that there hath not come to my hand any booke directly tending to this end, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound here in the ſeauen Treatiſes following, to helpe the frailtie of Gods children, and namely, by ſetting before their eies as in a glaſſe, the infinite, ſecret, and deceitfull corruptions of the heart: from whence (without a gracious regarding of the ſame) ſore and dangerous euils doe ariſe and breake out in their life. Neither haue I ſeene any treatiſe, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction particularly drawne and gathered for mens liues to gouerne and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, which tieth them to daily vſe of the ſame throughout their whole courſe: of both which my purpoſe is moſt chiefly,<note place="margin">The intent of the author, and generall ſumme of the whole booke.</note> as well faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as louingly, to intreate, and to aide my poore neighbours and brethren, with that which I haue gathered by reading, and noted by experience, if by any meanes I may be able hereby, to make the Chriſtian way any thing more eaſie and pleaſant vnto them, then many finde it: and to bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to more price, then the moſt doe value it at.</p>
            <p>In few words, this is that which I aime at, that ſuch as <hi>haue taſted how good the Lord is, and haue felt the power of the life to come,</hi> by any worke of faith and Chriſtian life, which they haue obtained by the preaching of the Goſpell, may after that, ſee their wants, their infirmities, their corruptions, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, hindrances, &amp; other diſcouragements, from that bleſſed eſtate wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into

they are entred: and how they may euery day in the beſt manner, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, or at leaſt wiſe weaken and diminiſh them, and that they may alſo behold their liberties and prerogatiues, which they haue by Chriſt: as the certaintie of Gods loue, deliuerance from the feare of the great and euill day, peace and comfort through faith, and the bleſſednes of ſuch an eſtate, and daily inioy the ſame. And therefore, not to be as men that haue no ſuch priuiledges, either caſt downe with needeles feare, or poſſeſſed with an earthly or vaine reioycing, or deſtitute of incouragement to walke forward in an heauenly courſe:<note place="margin">The fruite and benefit of it to the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> But that they may be mery in the Lord, and yet without lightnes; ſad and heauie in heart for their owne ſins, and the abominations of the land, and yet without diſcouragment, or dumpiſhnes: reſting and beleeuing in God, without bold preſumption, and fearing their owne weaknes, but yet without dreadfull and deadly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpayring. And that thus the Chriſtian man, and he who is faithful indeede, may ſo carrie himſelfe in his courſe, as he may haue no thought or purpoſe to reuolt and turne from this hope which is ſet before him, but be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he is infinitly incouraged, to hold out conſtantly therein, againſt all that might come in his way to the contrarie.

               </note>To theſe (I ſay) who haue ſet themſelues in a full, and reſolute purpoſe to paſſe their daies godly in the midſt of many encombrances, and <hi>to walke with the Lord,</hi> ſo far as of fraile fleſh may be obtained (how weake ſo euer in their owne perſwaſions) to theſe (I ſay) I deſire in this treatiſe of mine to be ſome helpe and aſſiſtance, and to ſpeake plainely, that ſuch as would faine doe well,<note place="margin">The firſt.</note> and yet cannot tell how, may hereby be eaſed and relieued. And if any (who yet are in ſuperſtition,<note place="margin">The authors deſire that they might profit by it.</note> hypocriſie, prophanenes, or as yet in darknes) deſire to be partakers thereof alſo, and ſo to like of that aduice and inſtruction, which is written for the beleeuers, that they be willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the wicked, crooked, and curſed way, which they haue walked in: I ſhould be ſo farre from enuying them this bleſſing, that (although this was not ſet out directly for them) yet they may vnderſtand, that with ſuch a willing mind, as I haue vndertaken this worke for their good who <hi>are in Chriſt</hi> alreadie; with the like, I am readie to further and helpe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, who thinke and know themſelues as yet to be <hi>ſtrangers from Chriſt</hi> altogether; and to reioyce, if I might vnderſtand, that they haue been moued hereby with their brethren, to become the true diſciples of Chriſt.<note place="margin">This worke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to better the good.</note> Indeede I haue not laboured ſo much, to perſwade theſe to returne from their miſerie, and to become penitent, becauſe many both examples of the like, and reaſons to moue them, are plentifully, plainely, and in good order, extant among them alreadie; and for that I know, that for the moſt part, they profit not by our writing, who doe not before regarde and take good by our preaching: and yet they ſhall haue my beſt aduice in the end.</p>
            <p>But as for ſuch as haue alreadie been in the truth of their hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto the Lord, and vnfainedly been called backe <hi>from the former luſts of their ignorance,</hi> and the faſhion of the world, after the which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb facs="tcp:16851:6"/>
they framed themſelues: for ſuch (I ſay) I know it is the earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of their hearts, that they may as well haue a path-way to godlines, and a direction to the ſame lie by them, to the which they may alwayes at neede reſorte, when publike helpes by ſermons cannot euermore be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed: as alſo to be made more fit thereby, to profit by them, when they doe repaire vnto the ſame. And although I looke not for it, that ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhould be made of this booke among the greateſt number, who haue reſolued with themſelues either not to learne or imbrace any thing more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alreadie they haue, eſpecially proceeding from a meaner perſon then themſelues: or to ſcorne whatſoeuer agreeth not with their humor, and to cauill and quarrell with that, which naturall reaſon doth not allow; yet (wiſhing better things vnto ſuch) I am not diſcouraged, but for their ſake who would deſire the ſame in practiſe which here they ſhall finde by reading, I will goe forward in this enterpriſe.</p>
            <p>I know it can doe the beſt no harme.<note place="margin">It is of vſe to all ſorts of good chriſtians, and that was one reaſon of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it out.</note> I am ſure (truſting and looking for the bleſſing of God) that it ſhall do many good, ſuch I meane as would doe well, if they knew how; and would grow wiſer, ſounder and more conſtant in faith and a godly life, if they had helpe and direction thereto plainely ſet before them. And I am not aſhamed to ſay,<note place="margin">The ſecond reaſon of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it forth.</note> that for mine owne furtherance as well as other mens, and the better carriage of my ſelfe through this my pilgrimage; I haue been willing to gather ſome ſuch things together, as in this ſmall volume I haue contriued.<note place="margin">The third.</note> Neither had it come into the hands of others, vnleſſe ſuch as are of account aboue my ſelfe for their gifts, as well as my neighbours,<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> among whom I haue preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the doctrine, had perſwaded me to ſet it forth. Beſides all that hath been ſaid, I haue chiefly in this enterpriſe (as God doth know) ſought this, that this vnperfect &amp; weake labour of mine may ſtir vp and moue ſome of my godly brethren (who for the habilitie and grace which God hath giuen them, if their leaſure had been as much as mine, might tenne-fold more profitably and ſubſtantially haue vndertaken it) to enlarge and perfect the ſame, the argument being ſo needfull and profitable, to the further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Gods Church and people.<note place="margin">The fift.</note> Another reaſon of ſetting out this treatiſe was this, that they who deſire it, may ſee, by the diligent marking of the ſame, the beauties of the Chriſtian life more clearely, then by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians liues it can bee ſeene, and that it may bee brought into greater account with many, who thinke it (through errour) ouerbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome.</p>
            <p>And partly alſo I was moued hereunto by this reaſon,<note place="margin">The ſixt.</note> that the Papiſts caſt in our teeth, that we haue nothing ſet out for the certaine and daily direction of a Chriſtian, when yet they haue publiſhed (they ſay) many treatiſes of that argument. For anſwere to the firſt poynt of this obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they cannot deny (but that they care not what they ſay, to bring the people out of loue with our religion) they cannot (I ſay) deny, that both in catechiſmes, ſermons, and other treatiſes, there is ſet forth by vs that which may cleerely direct Chriſtians, and ſtir vp godly deuotion in them, though all be not gathered together into one volume: for the ſecond part concerning their treatiſes, I graunt there are two which I haue ſeene,
<pb facs="tcp:16851:7"/>
ſet forth by them in our Engliſh tongue, the one called a Chriſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectorie, the other the Exerciſe of a Chriſtian life, wherein the author doth, though both ſuperſtitiouſly and nothing properly, goe about to teach and giue direction for euery day in the weeke; (the one bearing the name of <hi>Robert Parſons</hi> the King of Spaines confeſſor: the other by an <hi>Italian a Ieſuite Doctor in Diuinitie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iaſper Loarte.</note> and tranſlated into Engliſh by ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite of Poperie) the firſt is nothing leſſe then a direction for a Chriſtian though it be called a Directorie, tending rather to perſwade men to reſolue with themſelues to leaue ſome groſſe euils, then to ſhew them ſoundly how to attaine pardon, or teaching how to liue chriſtianly: the other is a ridiculous tying men to a daily taske of reading ſome part of the ſtorie of Chriſts paſſion, and ſaying certaine prayers throughout the weeke euery day a taske; but indeede nothing leſſe then directing, after the will of God, him who deſires to leade a Chriſtian life. Both of them I dare boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, being deceiued themſelues, doe deceiue others, eſpecially the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who is not able to diſcerne and trie the lying ſpirit in them. The one, that is to ſay, <hi>Parſons,</hi> hath vnder a pretence of a holines and deuotion, ſet downe ſundrie impediments to reſolution: But yet they are put in among other things to take away the harſhnes and tartnes of manifold errours of merit, and other ſuperſtition mixed with them and vpholden in that religion, and as it were, with ſugar to ſeaſon them, which elſe no taſte could abide, and in the depth of a ſubtill heart, put in, to make the world beleeue, that the <hi>Popiſh religion</hi> is the onely holy religion, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof the godlieſt liuers; when yet Antichriſt is their captaine, and head, or (as they will not deny) the Pope of Rome, who yet doth, and for theſe many yeares hath vpholden and maintained open, and almoſt infinit hereſies and abominations.</p>
            <p>And as their religion and worſhip is compoſed and framed of hereſies and lies, and a confuſed heape of ſuperſtitions, and outward dead workes, euen Iewiſh and Heatheniſh ceremonies; ſo the perſons themſelues who profeſſe they know moſt, and that they are able to giue rules vnto others, vpholding and building vpon ſo rotten foundations, are furtheſt off from well guiding others, ſo that no man may euer looke by any Popiſh direction to liue chriſtianly. Although I will not diſſemble what I thinke, namely, that ſome doe meane more ſimply and truely then the reſt, and thinke that they ſerue God aright hauing deuout minds, but being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the truth, muſt needes be deceiued.</p>
            <p>But of Maiſter <hi>Parſons</hi> booke of Reſolution, ſeeing he and ſome other haue ſet it out in a gloſing ſtile to inſinuate with the ignorant and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reader, that he ſeekes no other thing but to draw him to pietie and godlines, I cannot forbeare, but I muſt ſay a little, which otherwiſe I would not haue done. And the rather, for that I know, he hath ſnared many ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple peoples conſciences thereby, who being themſelues willing to be led in a right way, beleeue that he meanes as he ſpeaketh; and therefore are left, I ſay, deceiued, and in a bottomles gulfe; out of the which, if God helpe them not ſome other way, it is not poſſible for them to get. And this I ſay firſt, for the deliuering of ſuch out of the ſnare and maze in which
<pb facs="tcp:16851:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they haue loſt themſelues by reading of that booke, that although there be a pretended ſhew of godlines in it, and much ſuperſtition; yet the beſt of it is farre from true pietie and godlines, ſeeing that, and euery part of it proceedeth from faith ioyned with aſſurance of Gods fauour,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.22. Act. 15.9.</note> which is that alone that purifieth the heart, and maketh it able to bring fourth fruits of amendment of life; without which, mens beſt actions are wrought by the ſtrength of corrupt nature, and are fruites of the fleſh, and workes of darkenes, and ſo abominable. And yet this faith doe Papiſts make no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of, neither therefore can the booke of Reſolution teach or hold it.</p>
            <p>Further, I ſay that the law onely is vrged in that booke, without teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poore ſoule that may be terrified thereby, how to lay hold on the promiſe of eternall life, and without the Goſpell:<note place="margin">Eſay. 61.1. Ezech. 34.4. Ioh. 8 32.</note> the truth and glad ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings whereof, is onely able to ſet at libertie the conſciences of ſuch as are ſtrangled by the threats and terrible curſe of the law: for if that truth make free (as our Sauiour ſaith) then are men free in deede. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it may be obiected to me, that I doe the author of the booke open wrong in ſaying, that he ioyneth not the Goſpell with the law; for he that readeth it, may finde, that he ſpeaketh of Ieſus Chriſt, that he was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by his father to the world, that many might be ſaued; and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: and how ſay I then that he teacheth the law without the Goſpell? I anſwere, that he doth indeede mention both the promiſes of the Goſpel, and alſo Chriſt; and this he doth in that chapter which is intituled [diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Gods mercie] but yet is that true that I ſay:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note> For the Goſpell is the power of ſaluation to him that beleeueth: and it is not the Goſpell if it be not beleeued: for that is a part of the deſcription of it: Now belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or faith hath aſſurance going with it, as I ſhewed out of the epiſtle to the Hebrues: Which the author of that booke with the reſt of his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth flatly deny; and therefore it is cleere, that he doth not teach the Goſpell, neither in that booke doth plainely and ſoundly guide the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſoule which ſeeth it ſelfe loſt, to finde remiſſion of his ſinne, and euerlaſting life; and conſequently, that he doth not direct his reader to liue godly, as I ſaid, but holdeth him in darknes and in the ſtate of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deceiueth him.</p>
            <p>And what reckoning he maketh of faith (which the word of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth before all other things, and ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.4.</note> that it ouercommeth all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the world) we may ſee by his owne words, in his preface fol. 6. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the diſcreet reader (ſaith he) of whatſoeuer religion and faith he be, to enter into the carefull ſtudie and exerciſe of good deedes, aſſuring him, that this is the right way, to obtaine at Gods hands the light of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. And a little after he ſaith, It is more eaſie to beleeue as we ought, then to liue, as we ſhould. Here we ſee, he preferres good deedes before faith: as if the fruite ſhould be ſaid to be more precious, then the tree that beares it. And yet as not marking what he ſaid, he vttereth theſe words a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which cannot ſtand with the other: Our fathers receiued one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme faith from their mother the holy Catholike Church, and did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only to builde vpon that foundation good workes and vertuous life, as holy Scripture commaundeth vs to doe. Here he affirmeth, that good
<pb facs="tcp:16851:8"/>
life commeth from faith. Thus while he ſpeaketh ſuch contraries, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, that good workes muſt be built on the foundation of faith; and with an other breath, that good life is the right way to bring faith, (and yet all may ſee he ſpeaketh of one and the ſelfe ſame faith in both places) muſt he not needes by ſo teaching, deceiue the ſimple reader while he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to vnderſtand what is taught, cannot poſſibly practiſe that which he ought?</p>
            <p>And it was not to be doubted (to ſpeake euen in charitie as in conſcience we ought) that the ſaid author promiſing in that his booke of Reſolution, that he would adde two other parts to it, (as thereby confeſſing, that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone was an inſufficient worke of it ſelfe, to be ſet forth; and therefore dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to intangle and ſnare the ignorant) and yet cannot in eighteene yeares finde a time to fulfill his promiſe; it was not to be doubted (I ſay) but that he was well content to deceiue and trouble many that ſhould reade it: As if one ſhould but preach the wrath of God for ſinne to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth perſons, (whereas his booke hath been in the hands of thouſands) and ſhould come no more in eighteene yeares, to helpe them out of feare and doubt, and how to liue afterwards, it would be condemned and that iuſtly, and cryed out of by all aduiſed people. And yet we may conclude, without any doubt, knowing his religion what it is (if euer he had any ſuch meaning, to ſet out two other parts) that they ſhould haue been as ſound as this one is, that is to ſay, vnwholeſome, full of damnable errors, and vncomfortable: For can men gather grapes of thornes, or figges of thiſtles? No more can any ſound fruite be reaped or comfort gotten by falſe and vnſauorie doctrine. But for <hi>Parſons</hi> deuotion (whereof his booke beares ſo great a ſhew) or how little of the labour was his, or how little honeſtie is in the man, yea rather how great iniquitie: let them of his owne religion teſtifie, I meane the ſecular prieſts in their bookes againſt the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites.</p>
            <p>But to ſay no more of <hi>Parſons:</hi> The other hath little in him worthie any account or reckoning, and to this purpoſe very nothing. To goe forward therefore, ſeeing this was one cauſe why I tooke this worke in hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Ieſuites caſt in our teeth the want of ſuch bookes, as may direct a Chriſtian aright through his whole courſe towards the kingdome of heauen, and yet that which they teach tending thereto, is but as poyſon in a golden cuppe; although, as I haue ſaid, there are many of my brethren, who had been fitter for this ſeruice then my ſelfe, if they had not been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome other way: yet I nothing doubt by the helpe of God, to frame out of the word of God by that little helpe of my knowledge and experience, ſuch a direction for Chriſtians (all oſtentation, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of learning ſet aſide) as ſhall giue them ſmall aduantage of boaſting, and ſhall be both more pleaſing to God, and more for the comforting the heart of him, who liſteth to be directed by it, then poperie can affoord: and withall, a direction, that hath not only been ſhaped out after the rules of the Scripture, but alſo ſuch as hath been and is practized and followed ſo farre forth, as of ſinfull fleſh may be looked for, both of miniſter and people, and approoued of thoſe who haue excelled, &amp; gone before many, in both.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:16851:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>And although I denie not, but that many things might haue been farre better ſet downe, and expreſſed, then I am able to doe; yet that none thinke me to haue taken in hand a matter aboue my reach, and wherein I haue no skill, thus much I ſay, that for theſe twentie yeares and more I haue ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at this, in my reading, preaching, and liuing, and in the obſeruing of my ſelfe, and the example of others, what communion and neere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance there may be betwixt God and a Chriſtian, what hold may be laid on the promiſes of God, what ſtrength may be gotten againſt ſinne, what freedome and libertie we may haue by faith, what ſetlednes and conſtancie in a godlie life, what comfort, and reioycing the children of God by his free graunt, may haue, euen in this life, and that both ſound and conſtant, which ſhall not be taken from them: alſo how farre the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may ouercome the fleſh, and how the diuell may be reſiſted. And more eſpecially for theſe ſeauen yeares and more, I haue more particularly ſet my ſelfe about the matter, which in this booke is contained (which how weakely ſoeuer it be performed, I haue therein a good conſcience:) Firſt, to ſhew, both how a man may become a true beleeuer, be brought into the fauour of God, and afterwards how he may be directed to leade his life daily: And therefore I haue not ſuddenly nor vnaduiſedly ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this. And what helpe I haue been able to get from others, as my conuenient opportunitie hath giuen leaue, I haue not neglected. The which I ſet downe (as I ſaid) that none may thinke me fantaſtically to haue gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to broch ſome noueltie, but rather to offer that to the people of God, which hath with good aduiſe been gathered for their edifying.<note place="margin">The ſeuenth reaſon.</note> But now to returne, the laſt reaſon mouing me to take this worke in hand, is, that they who haue inioyed my miniſterie aboue theſe twentie yeares, might haue me (as many of them haue oft deſired) after a ſort putting them in remembrance of that which I haue taught them in my life time, many yeares after I ſhall be taken from among them. This ſhall ſuffice to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of my intent and purpoſe in this treatiſe, with the reaſons thereof.</p>
            <p>Now it remaineth further to acquaint the reader with the order,<note place="margin">The third point in the preface.</note> which I vſe in the ſame, and to giue ſome inſtructions, that hee may reade it with the more profit; and that it may be more plaine and eaſie to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand (which I doe eſpecially intend) then otherwiſe it ſhould be. Firſt, therefore, becauſe I haue written it for their ſakes chiefly, which are truely called to be Gods Children, and haue an intereſt in his promiſes, as being conuerted to him from the ſubiection of the diuell: firſt I ſay,<note place="margin">The contents and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the whole booke, in ſeuen ſeuerall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes.</note> my purpoſe is in the formoſt treatiſe to ſhew, who are his, and who they are which in an holy, and humble manner may reſt ſatisfied in his promiſes, againſt all dreadfull feare and doubt which might diſquiet them: that ſo neither the looſe liuers may deceiue themſelues with an opinion of that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to them: nor Gods children be depriued of that,<note place="margin">The firſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> which is their owne, and the ignorant of both ſorts that liſt, may learne to know better and amend their eſtate. In the ſecond, I meane to ſhew,<note place="margin">The ſecond treatiſe.</note> what courſe of life ſuch perſons muſt walke in, throughout their dayes, and how they are to carie themſelues both towards God and men, which I thinke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to lay forth as cleerely as I can, and in ſome ample manner for

the more full ſatisfying of the ignorant ſort. From theſe two, all the other points handled in this booke doe ariſe.<note place="margin">The third trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> Therefore in the third, I will ſhew what are the meanes whereby this life may be maintained, and how the beleeuer ſhall vſe the ſame, to the end that this whole and great worke of worſhipping &amp; ſeruing God, may not be taken for a bare matter of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as the moſt doe make it: or (which is little better) for a ſeruing of God by halues, as too many profeſſors of the Goſpell doe vſe it: but for a faithfull regarding of our wayes, that they may be ſhaped out after Gods will.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The fourth treatiſe.</note>Now this practiſing of the godly life is performed by following a daily direction to guide vs, and whiles we doe euery day with conſcience ſet our ſelues to honour and obey God, as in our callings, and by other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions offered, we ſhall be able, and not wanderingly and vncertainly, as we haue been wont to doe. And ſo this ſhall bee ſet downe in the fourth treatiſe. And this is one of the points in this booke which requireth to be read againe and againe, as being neither commonly intreated of, and of ſingular vſe to ſuch as deſire to take good by it, eſpecially not being able otherwiſe to guide themſelues.<note place="margin">The fift trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> In the fift, I make the reader acquainted with the lets, which will hinder him (though he be willing to be directed daily) from this courſe, except he will be perſwaded to arme himſelfe with ſuch helps, as wherby he may withſtand them: and remedies againſt theſe lets ſhall in this fift treatiſe be ſet downe, as farre as ſhall be thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.<note place="margin">The ſixt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</note> The ſixt ſhall ſet before thee ſundrie priuiledges and bleſſings, which God doth peculiarly bequeath vnto, and beſtow vpon his beloued ones, beſides ſuch benefits as they haue in common with the men of the world.

All which, though I direct not this worke to the vnreformed, may be in ſtead of an exhortation vnto all looſe and careles perſons, (though more briefly, ſeeing there is enough written of that argument) to moue them to rouſe vp themſelues, and to awake out of their deadly ſleepe, and not to caſt away their ſoules for the loue of their ſinnes, (which they may be ſure that God will finde out howſoeuer they hide them) but to ſeeke betimes, that they be vnburthened of them, caſt them vp as a moſt filthie gorge, and auoide the vengeance of Gods wrath which wil otherwiſe moſt ſurely come vpon them for it: For though ſinne be ſweete in the committing of it, yet it will be bitter, when it comes to be repented of: and moſt bitter, when without repentance, it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for.</p>

               <note place="margin">The fourth point of the preface, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the reader, how to reade this booke with moſt profit.</note>Now it remaineth to direct the reader how to beſtow his time profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="tcp:16851:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
herein, and how he may reade it to his benefit. For I doubt nothing, but he that ſhall be conuerſant in it, deſiring to be directed in his courſe, ſhall thinke his time well ſpent, ſo as he be helped to vnderſtand the ſame. Firſt therfore let him reade the contents of it briefly ſet downe in the table before the booke, to helpe his memorie; then the marginall notes of the chapters. And if he conceiue and vnderſtand the ſhort ſumme of it ſo ſet downe; then let him reade the booke it ſelfe, till he be acquainted with and vnderſtand it: wherein if his capacitie be the weaker and ſhallower, he muſt deſire the helpe of ſome which are more skilfull (and better able to ſee the drift, ſcope and meaning of it) then himſelfe, eſpecially in ſuch points of it, as are more hard and difficult, either to vnderſtand, or to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. For although many ſhall haue no neede of this directing of them to reade it with profit, becauſe they can eaſily direct themſelues when they once know the generall parts, and argument of it, as before is mentioned: yet becauſe my deſire herein is as well to helpe and benefit the plaine, and ſimple, (ſuch as many of them are, amongſt whom I haue preached the ſame) as well as to bring the wiſer and more learned ſort acquainted with the practiſe of it, therefore I know they ſhall haue neede thereof.</p>
            <p>Now when they ſhall vnderſtand it in ſome good ſort, let them weigh and conſider, how far forth they haue had vſe of it heretofore, as whether they haue according to the firſt part of this booke, by the miniſterie of any ſound preacher of the Goſpell, attained to the aſſurance of their ſaluation, and of the forgiuenes of their ſinnes, wherein if any will take it as granted, though falſely, (as they are moſt readie to doe ſo, who haue leaſt felt the burthen of their ſinnes, and therefore are indeed furtheſt off from it) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I ſay, if any will needs deceiue themſelues, I cannot helpe it, but they are like to reade the reſt with leſſe fruit and comfort, and to goe without the vſe of it in their liues, whatſoeuer they hope for. And therefore ſuch I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to take moſt paine in the firſt part: I meane in the doctrine of it, and reading other treatiſes concerning the matter, as Maſter <hi>Mores</hi> and other catechiſmes; and Maiſter <hi>Perkins</hi> workes, namely, his booke intituled the graine of muſtard ſeede: And to raiſe all the doubts they can to any expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced teacher or brother, and to looke for, and ſee thoſe things worke vpon them which are taught there, both the doctrine of humiliation, and alſo of iuſtification and deliuerance.</p>
            <p>If this be attained, let them conſider for the better aſſuring themſelues hereof, that they cannot but affect, loue, imbrace, and delight in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſanctification, and <hi>repentance from dead workes,</hi> I meane they ſhall deſire to practiſe the godly and chriſtian life when they ſee that it is the commaundement of him who loueth them moſt dearely, and what it is, and wherein it conſiſteth, which is the ſumme of the ſecond treatiſe of this booke. And to this end, let them reade, and by marking ſeeke, (as ſuch who would finde) that they may ſee what ſinne there is in them which they are not willing nor deſirous to forſake (if there be any) or among duties ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally appertaining to all, or particularly touching themſelues, which they cannot ſubmit themſelues vnto. If there be either of theſe found in them, as that they cannot leaue nor be brought to renounce ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb facs="tcp:16851:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſins, nor obtaine of themſelues to be ſubiect to ſome ſpeciall duties, as thinking it too ſtrict (as thus it may be with many, and no doubt is) ſuch muſt know, that it is the doctrine of the Scripture, that all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God be had in account of vs,<note place="margin">Iam. 2.10. Heb. 13.18. Matth. 5.18.</note> and conſcience made of one as well as of another: which if they ſee and acknowledge according to the word of God, they cannot but ſubmit themſelues thereunto, if they haue rightly imbraced the doctrine of the former treatiſe, that as in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and knowledg they yeeld; ſo their heart and affections may goe with the ſame. And ſo doing, God will worke in them by little and little (ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by prayer of faith) euen as he wrought the like in them before, and weakned ſuch rebelliouſnes in their hearts alreadie.</p>
            <p>If therefore the teachable and chriſtian reader be thus farre wrought vpon by the ſpirit of God, that he thus fauour, approoue, and giue ouer himſelfe to be made truely repentant, which is that that is required in the ſecond treatiſe of this booke; then is he fit to occupie himſelfe about, and to be conuerſant in the third and fourth part of it, that is to ſay, in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which requireth a daily walking in a Chriſtian courſe, by the vſe of ſuch helps as are appointed of God for that purpoſe; and ſome of them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo daily, as in the proper place ſhall appeare. For euery true Chriſtian is to know, that the religion and worſhip of God muſt be in vſe and practiſe among the imbracers of it, as well one day as another. But how ſhall any be able to keepe his heart in frame, and reforme his life daily by the meanes which God hath appointed, as in the third and fourth part of this booke is required: except he be firſt a liker, and an allower of all knowne points of dutie, and doe hartily renounce all euill, as is required in the ſecond part? Which being done, let him looke to grow daily more ſtrong in faith, whereby he may hold, and keepe faſt the certaintie of Gods fauour daily, and conſtantly. And not as too many (and yet the people of God) doe, who are not acquainted with this: that their confidence ſhould be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained daily, or a good conſcience in their particular actions regarded, and that on one day as another, but thinke it enough at ſometimes to haue this care. Neither let any looke to repell this as too ſtrict, vnder pretence of weightie affaires, and their owne infirmitie. For this is but the deluſion of the diuell, as ſhall be ſhewed, who will eaſily perſwade it to be more then needeth. This is that which muſt be learned out of the third and fourth part.</p>
            <p>And when this is vnderſtood, approued, conſented vnto, and aymed at, the fift part of the booke ſhall be cleare and eaſie to vnderſtand, and what vſe he ſhould make of it, namely, of the lets and hinderances which the diuell raiſeth vp to hold him backe from this courſe of life, and the practiſe of the ſame: of the which ſome I will ſet downe, and helpe him the better to know many others thereby. And he that ſhall indeuour to direct his life, and take heede to his wayes, as he ſhall by Gods word be taught, ſhall breake through many of the lettes, which yet ſhall ſtrongly hold backe and hinder other men, as the fift part will ſhew: and if he be for a ſeaſon withdrawne from a godly courſe, yet he ſhall there finde helpes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to recouer againe; and little eaſe, otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16851:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>And if there be any difficultie in conforming a mans ſelfe after this forementioned doctrine (as I deny not but the fleſh will finde many) yet againſt them all, let him proceede and reade with good regard the ſixt Treatiſe, wherein are ſet downe the manifold and goodly prerogatiues and priuiledges, which God hath bequeathed to his people to hearten them on, and incourage them to godlines, and to make the chriſtian life eaſie; and he ſhall ſee great light, and finde exceeding force therein, to ſtirre him vp to goe forward mightily againſt all fainting. And then he ſhall not be moued for all the obiections, cauils and fleſhly reaſons which he ſhall reade in the ſeuenth part. For the comfort and experience, which he ſhall partly enioy alreadie, and partly hope for and expect afterwards, ſhall make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vaniſh away as ſmoke, although otherwiſe they are able to hurt and ſting, as fier. And then when in the due conſideration of the whole, he ſhall ſee what the bleſſednes and manifold good things are, which he in part hath alreadie, and ſhall afterwards inioy both here and in the life to come, he ſhall ſee what infinit cauſe he hath to praiſe God for his portion, that he hath rather beautified and bleſſed him with his fauour and graces then many other, whereby he may walke ſo comfortably, and that in this vale of miſeries, to Gods kingdome.</p>
            <p>And thus I aduiſe thee (good reader, as I know it ſhall be beſt for thee) to beſtow thy trauel about this booke: wherein I appoint thee no certaine time, nor houres, ſeeing all which would profit by it, cannot ſpend their time alike about this, or any other ſuch exerciſe. But this know, that this booke tendeth to teach thee the practiſe of thy knowledge, and not to know onely: and that I haue gathered together into this one, the things which are diſperſedly contained in many other. And therefore in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ouer and beſides the ordinarie reading of the holy Scriptures, thou maieſt beſtow the more time about it, as thy leaſure will permit, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that once or twice reading a booke for practiſe, is not enough.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſeeing the whole matter herein contained, is to ſerue thee and ſtand thee in ſteed, as ſetting before thee a direction to gouerne thy whole life, thou muſt not thinke thy labour and time much, though thou beeſt occupied in it for many yeares together: for as much as the fruite ſhall be greater, the longer that thou haſt been exerciſed in it: and yet thy labour leſſe, yea eaſie and pleaſant: for ſo ſhalt thou grow better acquainted with the vſe of it, which in one word is to make thy life more ſweet and ſauorie, then thou couldeſt looke for, that is, happie here, and hereafter, for euer. Reade therefore not onely to be able to report what thou haſt found here, but eſpecially to finde it thine owne which I doe teach: and to be ſetled daily in the gouernment which this doctrine drawne out of his word offereth thee, ſo as thou maieſt ſee that God, in the ſetting forth of it, hath directed me.</p>
            <p>Reade with a quiet, teachable and a meeke ſpirit, deſirous of that which I labour to bring thee to, rather then with a curious head to carpe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill; or cenſure that which thou doſt not practiſe nor follow. A dramme of grace is better then a pound of cenſorious wittines: remember that all our naturall gifts, and faculties of our ſoules ſhould be ſanctified: I goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:16851:11"/>
to make thee ſee thy ſelfe inwardly and outwardly to be trained vp in Gods family: where the heart muſt be well ſeaſoned, as well as thy whole life well ordered, till thou findeſt that which many a thriftie perſon doth in his outward eſtate; namely, that diet to be ordinarie with him, which ſometime had been feaſting cheere: for, when a poore man by his trauell and paine hath brought this to paſſe, hee thinkes his eſtate good, and that which pleaſeth him exceedingly well: So, labour thou in thy ſpirituall worke and ſeruing of God, to finde that gaine, and thriuing therein, that thou maieſt make thy ſoule as ioyfull euery day, and at as great peace with God, as ſometime thou ſcarcely haddeſt obtained once in the weeke or month. Which grace and prerogatiue that thou mayeſt make much of, when thou haſt it, looke backe and remember with thankes vnfained how farre thou haſt been off from it, and how little hope thou once haddeſt of obtaining it, when thou wert eaſily maſtered of thy ſinnes and paſſions, and know that it muſt coſt him many a prayer, and grone for it, who is yet without it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall be partaker of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough my chiefe purpoſe be to direct the true Chriſtian, who is already a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> how to walke daily through the courſe of this life, in ſuch wiſe as he may finde a very ſweete and effectuall taſte of eternall happines, euen here (which few doe thinke can be obtained) yet I haue thought it meete: firſt, to ſhew who are true beleeuers, and the children of God,<note place="margin">Hovv any may knovv they be the Lords.</note> and how men are brought vnto this eſtate, and thereby may know that they are ſo. Partly for them who deſire to be directed in a Chriſtian life, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they may haue this ready at hand by them, to ſhew them that they are the Lords, notwithſtanding many doubts be oft raiſed by Sathan againſt them, and that others may learne to know it, who are yet ignorant of it, as without the which, in vaine ſhould they goe about a godly life. Which as it is the weightieſt and chiefeſt poynt of all others in diuinitie, and the ground of the reſt which I haue taken in hand to intreate of; ſo it is with the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to be dealt in, whether we reſpect thoſe, which vnfolde and lay open the ſame, or thoſe, which deſire to be inſtructed, and perſwaded in the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>For it comes to paſſe by our corrupt nature, and ſlownes of heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and Sathans ſubtiltie many waies beguiling vs,<note place="margin">Most are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the aſſurance of ſaluation.</note> that we in nothing more deceiue our ſelues, then in, and about the aſſurance of ſaluation: for proofe hereof, we may vnderſtand that ſome, yea, many thouſands thinke that no man can know whiles he liueth here that he is the Lords,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Papists think it impoſſible.</note> neither can haue any aſſurance of his fauour till his death, vnleſſe it be by ſpeciall reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is the error of the Papiſts. On the other ſide,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Carnall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants thinke it eaſie.</note> many thinke that this is not ſo hard a queſtion, as that any that profeſſe the goſpell ſhould
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16851:14"/>
doubt of their ſaluation (notwithſtanding our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith that <hi>his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> flocke is but ſmall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 12.32. Matth. 7.14. Luk. 19. Matth. 7.21.</note> and that in compariſon <hi>but few ſhall be ſaued.</hi>) And this is the opinion of our common Proteſtants, which ſay <hi>Lord Lord,</hi> and yet are not prepared to doe the will of the Lord, and therefore farre from entring into the Kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>3.</hi> VVeake Christians full of doubting.</note>Beſides both theſe, many poore ignorant ſoules thinke whiles they doe well and ſerue God, they may be aſſured of their redemption by Chriſt: but if they be by any meanes hindred from pleaſing God, yea, though it be by meere frailtie, and corruption of nature, then they can haue no hold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which vncertaintie, though it cleaue vnto many who are deare vnto the Lord, yet it is to be counted their error and ſinne, and they muſt be brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to a more ſtaied iudgement, then thus to thinke: that either there is change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenes with God, or to be ſo much their owne enemies, as by meanes of this error to fill their liues with ſuch vncomfortablenes, and depriue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues hereby of this aſſurance of Gods loue, which is the ſtrongeſt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to true godlines.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſome few of a great many doubts and erronious opinions about this matter, as after ſhall appeare. For reſolution whereof, though many things muſt be ſaid, yet the matter it ſelfe may cleerely and ſoundly be ſet downe in few words.</p>
               <p>To the end therefore that theſe and ſuch like many ſee how farre differing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Gods thoughts are from mans, and (as I haue ſaid before) that al which haue receiued this doctrine, may haue it before their eyes daily in ſome eaſie and familiar manner to confirme them, I will, as God hath made me able, ſet downe that which is expedient for this point: and this I haue thought good to referre to theſe three heads.<note place="margin">Three generall heads, or parts of this first treatiſe.</note> Firſt, to ſhew how a man may attaine to this, to know that he is the child of God, and how God worketh it by his ſpirit in the hearts of thoſe which are his. Secondly, how the weake beleeuers may vphold themſelues in temptation, and ſo be ſtaied, as ſeeing that they differ apparantly from thoſe, which are not the Lords. And thirdly, how they may afterwards more eaſily prooue that they haue true faith, and be able to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> confirme and preſerue the ſame: and finde how much ſuch an eſtate is to be deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three branches of the first head.</note>And for the plaine declaration of the firſt point hereof, theſe three things muſt be handled. The firſt, the cleere knowledge of mans miſerie. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of his redemption and deliuerance out of the ſame. And the third, how both theſe ought to worke vpon their hearts, and what fruite they will bring foorth by the operation of the holy Ghoſt in ſuch as ſhall be ſaued: That is to ſay, that the one which is the knowledge of miſerie, will wound and humble their hearts, when they ſhall ſee thereby, that they are but dead and damned people. The other will heale the ſores of their hearts, and lift <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> them vp againe, to the beholding of all their ſinnes pardoned, and their woe remoued ſo, as if they had neuer been preſſed downe with the ſame. And to this ſhall be adioyned a diſcourſe of the lets of faith, and what deſire it is from which it commeth.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O begin therefore with their miſerie,<note place="margin">The firſt head.</note> and briefly to ſpeake of it, and the next branch (ſeeing they are of others large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled) no man muſt think that it is the eſtate wherein God at the firſt created them,<note place="margin">The firſt point of mans miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> either <hi>Adam</hi> the father of all the world, or his poſterity which was then in his loines.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Sure it is (I ſay) that it was not thus with mankind in the beginning: for God then made all things good, and man amongſt other creatures hee made holie, and happie,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.26. Heb. 2.7.</note> the lord of all the creatures which were vpon the earth, little inferiour to the Angels, indued with infinite bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, full of beautie and glorie. So that when it might be ſeene that nothing was wanting but this, that he was not altogether free from loſing this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eſtate, yet euen there the diuell tooke an occaſion againſt him,<note place="margin">Reuel. 12. Gen. 3.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued him, and his poſteritie, and caſt them from that happie condition which before they enioyed.</p>
               <p>And yet if this had been all the harme that mankind by the malice of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> diuell ſuſtained, it had been little in reſpect of that which fell vpon him. For behold, beſides the loſſe of his felicitie, he was plunged into extreame miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and deſolation, which conſiſteth of theſe two branches,<note place="margin">Two parts of mans miſerie: firſt his ſinne. <hi>Gen. 6.5.</hi>
                  </note> that hee doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, and in all things offend God, being able to doe nothing but that which diſpleaſeth him, as hauing his heart alwaies and onely euill. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he in all this is odious to God, and moſt iuſtly accurſed of him.<note place="margin">Hoſea 1.2. Coloſſ. 1.21. <hi>Mans ſinne vvhat.</hi>
                  </note> Mans ſinne is not onely that tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> in moſt vnnaturall and treacherous rebellion, and diſobedience, whereof hee is moſt iuſtly guiltie with <hi>Adam,</hi> and hath his part (as being to ſtand or fall with him) but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which riſeth out of this, euen that infection of all the powers and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> both of the ſoule and bodie. Which as poyſon put into a cup of wine doth make it deadly, diſperſing it ſelfe into the ſame: in like manner this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or concupiſcence, which by the firſt ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is ſpread ouer his poſteritie, doth poyſon his whole nature:<note place="margin">Euery part cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</note> ſo that no ſound part is found in him from the crowne of the head to the ſole of the foot. And from hence it is that the vnderſtanding, euen the excellenteſt power of the mind,<note place="margin">

And thereafter is he caried of his affections, as a chariot on her wheeles, onely to that which diſpleaſeth God. What ſhould I ſay more? For who can chuſe but bewaile and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuch a diſtreſſed and wofull eſtate of the ſoule of man, which ſomtimes hauing been framed after the image of God, in true holines and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is now both emptie of that grace, and filled with all filthines of ſinne and

vncleannes? But alas, who beleeueth this or conſenteth to it, that it is true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that man (who hath ſo good an opinion and high conceit of himſelf) ſhould yet be indeed ſo farre off from that which he dreameth of, and in ſuch bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſlauerie, as hee would ſeeme to be fartheſt off from the leaſt part thereof?<note place="margin">Conuerſation.</note> But (to goe forward) if his conuerſation and courſe of liuing, which is the vntimely fruite of this bitter roote, were laid out in her colours (which I muſt onely very briefly touch) it were able to make him who thinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt innocent, to appeare moſt vile and loathſome in his owne eyes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of himſelfe, and to hide himſelfe in a dungeon that no other might behold him.

               <p>But here I thinke it not vnſeaſonable to adde this (ſeeing ignorant people, which lie yet in their ſinnes, doe harden their hearts at the hearing of this) that none haue iuſt cauſe to quarrell with the Lord: for if any thing ſpoken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of in this argument, diſpleaſe them, they may thanke themſelues.

And further they may vnderſtand, that God alloweth not his miniſters, who publiſh this meſſage of mans wofull eſtate, to deliuer it barely and nakedly, and to preach the law onely, but to ioyne the glad tidings of the Goſpell with it in their miniſterie, and to preach remiſſion of ſinnes with the vrging of repentance, and with the pricking of the peoples hearts by terror and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their ſinnes: as our Sauiour, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and other his faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> did.

               </p>
               <p>Out of theſe places, as alſo many other, to the full and plaine declaration of this remedie, theſe foure things are to be conſidered. Firſt, what it is, and wherein it conſiſteth. Secondly, by whom it is wrought. Thirdly, how it is brought to light and reuealed. And fourthly, how it is receiued and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Now as concerning the firſt,<note place="margin">The firſt point about the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</note> the onely ſufficient remedie for the ſauing of man, is to ſatisfie Gods iuſtice, which by ſinne is violated: without which ſatisfaction, the wrath of God cannot be appeaſed, nor his fauour obtained, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and ſo there can be no redemption. For how ſhould the Lord be perfectly iuſt, if he ſhould chaunge this righteous ſentence of his law, that euery tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor is curſed, and only the perfect keeper of the law bleſſed? Now then Gods iuſtice is ſatisfied only by theſe two meanes: Firſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.12.</note> by ſuffering the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to ſinne, which is the curſe of God; and the perfect keeping of the law,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22. and 12.14.</note> without which there can be no deliuerance from ſinne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. The onely remedie of our miſerie conſiſting herein, wee may cleerely ſee that it is out of our ſelues, and not in any other creature: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we, nor any other creature for vs, is able either to ſuſtaine the curſe, much leſſe to ouercome it: or perfectly to fulfill the law, which is impoſſible to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> fleſh. Whereby is quite ouerthrowne the foundation of Poperie,<note place="margin">Rom. 8 3.</note> and all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of merite, or of any thing in man to auaile to his iuſtification.</p>
               <p>But to goe forward to the ſecond point, to ſhew by whom it is purchaſed:<note place="margin">The ſecond point about the remedie.</note> This remedie, which could be had by no other, is appointed by the Father, vndertaken and wrought by Chriſt, and ſealed in mens hearts by the holie Ghoſt. It is wrought (I ſay) and found only and wholy in Ieſus Chriſt, God and man, who being perfect God tooke our humane nature on him; and in

both became a moſt mercifull Mediatour betwixt his father and vs, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> vs to him: and both ſuffered the full weight of Gods curſe due to our ſinne, by the power of his Godhead ouercomming the ſame, as alſo fulfilled the law for vs, whereby he fully ſatisfied the iuſtice of God. So that moſt truly it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Act. 4.12.</note> that ſaluation is in no other, but that in him onely is the whole remedie of the miſerie of mankinde to be found: <hi>There is giuen no other name vnder heauen</hi> (as the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh) <hi>whereby we muſt be ſaued:</hi> So that <hi>whoſoeuer hath the Son</hi> (as S.<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith) for to redeeme him, <hi>hath life, and he that hath not the Sonne, hath not life.</hi> And to make vp the whole matter: if any ſhould aske how Chriſts redemption is made mans, he is to know, that God his father of his marueilous loue gaue him freely (euen as hee had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> promiſed him) with all his whole worke of redemption, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith:<note place="margin">Rom. 58.</note> 
                  <hi>God declared his loue to vs, that when wee were yet his enemies, he ſent Chriſt to die for vs,</hi> that <hi>whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not any longer lie vnder Gods wrath and periſh,</hi>

For there is no way to receiue Chriſt and all his merits (the full medicine of mans miſerie) but by faith.

This therefore is to be knowne of him who ſhall be ſaued, and his iudgement is to be ſetled in this truth, before he enioy it as his owne, or can haue his part in it. He muſt be able to ſee cleerely and ſoundly that God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hath made this Chriſt Ieſus his ſonne Lord ouer all creatures, conqueror of the diuels, deliuerer of the captiues, &amp; comforter of the heauie hearts: ſo that by him there is as full pardon of ſinne purchaſed,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> as euer was by <hi>Adam</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured guiltines and condemnation.

which is in hand, that is, to ſhew how this doctrine worketh in him, who by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> it ſhall come to true faith and aſſured hope of ſaluation, we are to know, that he remaineth not an idle and vnprofitable hearer, as ſometime, and as many other ſtill doe, but is ſecretly drawne, he cannot tell how, by the vnſpeakable worke of the ſpirit of God to be perſwaded, that the doctrine taught doth conerne him;<note place="margin">Col. 1.9.</note> the Lord giuing him with his knowledge, wiſedome, which is a gift of the ſpirit, whereby he applleth generall things particularly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and that he thereby ſpeaketh vnto him, as well as he doth to any other, in the denouncing the threats of the law,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note> and euerlaſting damnation: and (his eyes being now opened to beleeue this) he thinketh himſelfe the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rableſt of all other, who before nothing at all regarded the welfare of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſoule, but thought himſelfe in as good caſe to Godward, as any other. Hee now perceiueth (I ſay) himſelfe not onely a loathſome creature in Gods ſight, through the Ieproſie of ſinne, but withall a moſt curſed and damned creature, ſubiect to all Gods plagues in this world, and to condemnation in the world to come. For although the world lie in darknes, and beleeueth not the law of God, leaſt it ſhould be conuicted by it (and therefore cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the promiſes of the Goſpell) yet God otherwiſe prouideth for his, that they by ſeeing and feeling the deſert of their ſinnes, may haue an appetite thereby to ſeeke mercie and forgiuenes, which without it is vnſauourie to them: as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The whole haue no neede of the Phiſition, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the ſicke,</hi> Matth. 9.12. Neither let this deepe impreſſion of the doctrine of the law preached (being no leſſe ſenſible to the partie that feeles it, then the print of the ſeale is to our eye in the ſoft waxe:) let it not (I ſay) be counted a meane and common mercie: In deede it is meanly accounted of, the doctrine of it being ſo common and oft taught. For as it is ſaid of faith, Luk. 18.8. that when the Sonne of man commeth, he ſhall finde it rare in the world: ſo in ſome ſort wee may ſay of this, that it is rare, that men, who know that all are vnder the wrath of God, till the Sonne of God make them free, doe beleeue indeede that it is ſo with them, and euen their owne caſe.</p>
               <p>Oh, men ſhunne this as death (and yet without beleeuing it there is no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> life) for did they beleeue it perſonally for their owne parts, they could not but lay it to heart: ſo as the whole powers thereof ſhould be taken vp with the cogitation of it (as it is with vs at the ſudden hearing of heauie newes) yea all the powers of the minde and heart would be affected with it, euen as a man is by the ſting of an Adder, or when he is pricked with the point of a ſword: ſo (I ſay) it is with him that doth vnfainedly beleeue his owne miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, without exception caſting away all deluding conceits which might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: ſuch a ſudden alteration it ſhall worke in him, how farre off ſo euer hee was before that from it.<note place="margin">Act. 2.37.</note> And that is liuely ſet foorth in the example of the three thouſand that were conuerted at <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon: who for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> before, had been of them that crucified Chriſt, and euen at that preſent time were mockers and railers at the Apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>they were drunken with new wine:</hi> yet when on the ſudden the Lord arreſted them by his word and challenge, and with his ſpirituall ſword, by <hi>Peters</hi> skilfull handling the ſame, had wounded and ſtriken them (ſo as they could not ſcape nor reſiſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and ſtroke of it) they were pricked in their harts, as if an arrow had pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16851:18"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their liuer, crying out immediatly, that the paine which they felt within them was intolerable: which they expreſſed in their words when they made their mone euen vnto them whom they had ſo lately railed vpon; now ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with new tongues (which is admirable) <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall wee doe?</hi> Euen thus in ſome ſort doth the Lord worke, when hee maketh them to giue credit to this his thundring voyce by his law arraigning men for their ſinnes: which is no leſſe fearefull to them then the roaring of a lion, when yet other men, whoſe ſinnes are as great, and haue as good cauſe to be feared, and to faint vnder the burthen of them, are not a whit mooued thereat: not moued, I ſay, through the commonnes of it, any more then the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> fowles are afraid of the ſcar-crow, after they haue been long accuſtomed to it, who in time dare ſit vpon the head of it, and plucke ſtrawes out of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry noſe thereof.</p>
               <p>And this I doe the more ſtand vpon, to make this point cleere, becauſe I haue obſerued by long experience, how groſſely the people of our age doe ſuffer themſelues to be bewitched about this matter. For to bewaile them who are ſoone healed, if they be pricked at all, and them who fall deadly to raging at the Miniſter, if their hearts be vexed by hearing their daunger: I ſay, to bewaile the eſtate of them, there is yet a third ſort (in number an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for one of the other) who were neuer troubled in conſcience for their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſinne, or the woe that it hath purchaſed them; neither doe once dreame that ſuch a thing is needfull for them: but eate, drinke and ſleepe, ſome play,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.27.</note> and ſome worke; and, as they did in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> imbrace this preſent euill world, prophane, merrie, yea and light-hearted, when (as S.<note place="margin">Iam. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith) they ſhould houle and mourne: and as though they feared no more then they would make men beleeue they doe, are neuer ſcared, till the very time and houre of death, or deadly daunger. But what do they then? when they haue called in luſtily, as men at a banquet, I meane, when they haue taken their pleaſure and liued therein? I ſay, when they ſee their reckoning, and day of accounts is neere, then what doe they? where is their mirth become? Oh, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they die as <hi>Nabal,</hi> that is, as fooles, and are as he was, when he heard he ſhuld die, as a ſtone, and a blocke: or deſpaire, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, and ſome of them die as he died, that is, ſooner then they needed (as well as they loued their life.) And the beſt ſort of them are but as they that are ſpoken of by the Prophet, that is, they haue no bands in their death: they die quietly, perhaps with a Lord haue mercie on vs: but they not regarding bleſsing in their life,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 73.4. Luk. 13.2.</note> it is now farre from them at their death, and therefore dying without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, let other be feared by them.</p>
               <p>And yet while the world is full of ſuch people (as I haue ſaid) behold, as if they yet wanted ſomething to make them miſerable, how this vnſauourie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and dangerous ſpeech is ſpread farre and neere among ſuch,<note place="margin">The lavv is to be preached.</note> by many mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as well as common perſons: who crie out, that it is pitie that ſome are ſuffered to preach the lawe: and that ſuch vrging of mens conſciences for their ſinnes, is enough to driue the people to deſperation: and ſuch like. When yet S.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> commaunds that the word be preached with all authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which men may not be able to reſiſt, and with conuincing of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the Acts commends the fruite of that doctrine ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16851:19"/>
euen that they were pricked in their harts for their ſinnes, without which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> they had neither repented,<note place="margin">But not vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Goſpell.</note> nor obtained pardon of their ſinnes. Indeede, if any preach the law alone without the glad tidings of the Goſpell, or vrge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance without the incouragement of Gods mercie through Chriſt and forgiuenes of ſinnes, he were worthie to be ſharply reproued, and to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained till he ſhould amend ſo dangerous an error and ſo grieuous a fault. But if any finde fault with the ioyning of both together, when experience and Scripture doe ſhew, that no other kinde of preaching can profit and doe good in the Church, they are earneſtly to be deſired, if they doe it of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to be taught; if of a worſe minde, to deſiſt from it. But this ſhall ſuffice for anſwere to this ſpeech, raſhly and vnwiſely caſt foorth to cauſe many to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſtumble at. I returne to that from which I went aſide a little, to perſwade thoſe which are teachable, that God doth vſe to make his law to caſt downe ſuch as he purpoſeth to lift vp againe, as I haue ſaid.</p>
               <p>The Scripture yeeldeth many complaints and cryings out of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, who acknowledged as much: Some when they had once eſcaped the daunger of their former woe;<note place="margin">1.

And God be thanked, although they are but a few of ſo many thouſands as haue liued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in former ages, yet he hath not left this vnwitneſſed by many in this our age, of whom ſome are fallen aſleepe, and others remaine amongſt vs vnto this day, who with bitter complaints, ſalt teares, and dolefull groanes, no leſſe ſenſibly, then <hi>Iacob</hi> ſorrowed when he thought that a wild beaſt had deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his ſonne <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Gen. 37.34. haue confeſſed the depth of their woe, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſeeking, if by any meanes they might finde eaſe and deliuerance: although the moſt are hardned, and can bee brought to no ſuch abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> That God thus moueth him to deliberate in ſo weightie and doubtfull a caſe, no man neede to call it into queſtion, when nothing is well done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, in earthly matters of any moment, where the wit of man is the chiefe or only agent and dealer. For we know that raſhnes doth nothing well: how much more then may we think, that God will not ſuffer him, whom he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to bring to ſo great honour as the aſſured hope of ſaluation is, to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it without due regard and conſideration? eſpecially, he dealing by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes, where they may be had and come by? But that he entreth into conſultation what to doe,<note place="margin">Ierem. 8.6.7.</note> it is euident by that the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith with a vehement complaint, when the people were called to repentance, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the Prophet waited to ſee what fruit ſhould follow, that there was none that ſaid, <hi>What haue I done?</hi> that is, none entred into conſultation about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Therefore it is ſaid, that the prodigall ſonne,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.17.</note> who reſembleth moſt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſinner, and in his returning home to his father reſembleth the penitent ſinner in turning to God: that he did before that, come to himſelfe, and ſay, <hi>How many hired ſeruants in my fathers houſe haue bread enough, and I die for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi> Which, what other thing was it, then to conſider and deliberate what he were beſt to doe? And the Steward queſtioning with himſelfe what to doe, when hee was warned to giue an account of his ſtewardſhip, doth plainly teach this. Beſides all that hath been ſaid, if the godly who had fallen, could <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> not repent before they remembred and conſidered their fall, and from whom they were fallen, as we reade of the Church of Epheſus,<note place="margin">Reuel. 2.4.</note> and <hi>Peter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wept bitterly remembred the words of Ieſus, and how he had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt them: Vpon all theſe conſiderations, let vs not doubt, but that God draweth his, to conſult about their eſtate what they ſhould doe, being in anguiſh and diſtreſſe of mind. And that they may looke for little good to come of their caſting downe, and ſorrow, which by the law is conceiued in

them, if they doe not in the moſt ſerious manner, as they be able, and as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> caſe requireth, thinke and deliberate about it. And therfore they whom God watcheth ouer, if they be not able to counſel themſelues, yet the Lord guides them to aske counſell of others, as the forementioned example in the Acts, and of the woman of Samaria doth teach: And in what manner hee doth this, &amp; what thoughts he hath about the ſame, is not hard to coniecture; but euen as other in the ſame eſtate, mentioned in the Scripture doe teſtifie: namely what he is to doe, and whether there bee any hope, how hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched to come to that eſtate;<note place="margin">The complaint of the penitent ſinner.</note> what he hath loſt, and depriued himſelfe of, in this his eſtrangement from God, by following and ſeeking his owne will, and fooliſh libertie: he ſeeth an end is come of the curſed race which he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> runne, and that little time which he hath yet remaining, will alſo full ſoone be gone: His delights, ieſts, merrie conceits, dreames, and vaine hope that hee had of long life, of promotion, increaſe of riches, of good cheere with his companions, or ſuch like, alas they are gone! he is aſhamed to thinke what deceiueable pleaſures they were. And as for ſafetie and ſound peace, he ſeeth how farre off from them he is. He ſeeth that his former life will be called to an account, and is alreadie. And although he thinketh of delaies, excuſes, or other vaine ſhifts and deceiuing of himſelfe: yet he ſeeth that theſe cannot put away the deadly remembrance of his wofull eſtate, eſpecially when hee conſidereth, that <hi>God will not be mocked,</hi> nor his word be fruſtrate, which hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> bewraied his miſerie.</p>
                  <p>He will therefore <hi>conſult no longer with fleſh and bloud,</hi> as he hath done, but putteth away all fleſhly and carnall ſhifts and holds; and by Gods gracious direction taketh counſell by the knowledge that hee hath; and conſidereth that <hi>no man can come to Chriſt, if the heauenly father draw him not</hi> by his ſpirit: And therefore although the ſorrow of hypocrites vaniſheth away, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to nothing, yet by Gods gracious working in him, it becommeth an occaſion of humbling and breaking of heart vnto him, and of much other good, as hereafter wee ſhall ſee. Alſo he conſidereth that <hi>God is ſlow to anger, and readie to forgiue ſinners, being gracious and full of mercie:</hi> And though that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> thought be repelled through the remembrance of the greatnes of his ſinne, and vnacquaintednes with the promiſe; yet there is no doubt, but that he is ſecretly vpholden by it from dreadfull deſpayre. Thus while preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort faileth he ſorroweth ſtill, and the more deeply, for that he thinketh vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he hath no part in it: and therfore being cut off that way for the time, he cannot but returne to think of his deſolation and woful condition, which breedeth deepe ſighs and ſorrowes afreſh: And he breaking foorth, as one full, which can hold no longer, it wrings out ſuch ſtrong cryes, <hi>Oh miſerable man that I am!</hi> what ſhall I doe? how ſhall I eſcape this fearefull vengeance? In this heauines, he accuſeth himſelfe, and complaineth: but to auoide that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> miſerie, he ſeeth it impoſſible; and to go vnder it ſtill, he feeles it intolerable. And although he knoweth that there is a remedie, and what it is (which yet many in ſuch heauines and abaſement doe dimmely and weakly know, and therefore their ſorrow is the more) yet can he not apply it to himſelfe by any meanes. In this extremitie therefore of his, and being in this ſtreight and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> he crieth out with <hi>Paul: O wretched man that I am! who ſhall deliuer me?</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And therefore the Lord guideth him to ſome inſtructour, as hee did <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ananias,</hi> Act. 9.17. or ſtayeth him by the publike miniſterie, or by his owne knowledge bringeth him, as wee reade of the prodigall child, Luk. 15.17. to counſell himſelfe by that which he hath heard.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thoughts, this is not the leaſt profitable which God enableth him to faſten vpon, that laying (as it were) his eſtate in a paire of ballance, he ſeeth that there is no hope of mercie, but certaine condemnation by lying ſtill in the eſtate, wherin he hath liued; and that he cannot appeare before Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate in it: now on the otherſide, he conſidering that God calling ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance, &amp; giuing his ſon to redeeme euen great offenders, <hi>that it may be</hi> (as the King of Niniueh ſaid) <hi>he will haue mercie vpon him</hi>; ſo that there is ſome hope by ſuing and ſeeking in humility &amp; remorſe vnto God: thus the Lord ſtill bringeth him on. And whereas ſome other in this caſe haſteth out of his ſorrow, if by any meanes he may either break through it, before it hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> humbled him, or wrought any ſuch effect, as to long after a remedy &amp; deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or els ouercome of it: yet the ſoule of the poore ſinner whom God meaneth to ſaue, being meekned &amp; humbled, waiteth till God doth further ſtay and vphold it, with continued ſighs &amp; deſires, that the bright beames of his fauour through Chriſt might ſhine vpon him, he deſiring aboue al things to be vnburthened of this woe, &amp; pardon of his ſins, and yet hath no power perhaps to pray for that which his ſoule moſt feruently deſireth. After this and ſuch like manner (as hath bin ſaid) is his conſultation &amp; reſolution: and this is his mind, &amp; thus he deliberateth and caſteth with himſelf: for though he in this caſe is not able to expreſſe his meaning, yet if he could vtter that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which he conceiueth, he would ſay, that theſe are his very thoughts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations with himſelfe. In which eſtate of his, although I affirme not that he is able to applie the remedie to himſelfe, yet this generall hope which hee hath found by the promiſes, that God is kind and mercifull to broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſinners, doth cauſe him to ſtay himſelf, that he may perhaps be ſo to him: and reſolueth vnfainedly and with full purpoſe, to goe forward in ſeeking forgiuenes of his ſinnes at Gods hands, this way he will take, <hi>if he periſheth he periſheth:</hi> yet ſome hope he hath; he reſoluing with himſelfe that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer walke in his former deadly eſtate, but that he will confeſſe and lay foorth his long continued wickednes, vnto the Lord, though it be againſt himſelfe: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> neither will he ſpare himſelfe, wherein he hath moſt pleaſed his owne heart: for why? he ſeeth what and how vaine the deſires of it be: and therefore is reſolute neuer to turne to them any more: yet (he being well inſtructed) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not this purpoſe of forſaking ſinne any meanes of his iuſtification, but in deteſtation of his former wickednes is moued and drawne by God ſo to doe. This reſoluing therefore, is one ſteppe or degree by which he paſſeth vnto the fuller certaintie of that happines which he ſeeketh: and he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a great meaſure of grace and fauour, when he hath attained to it: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sathan who knoweth this, holdeth men by many ſtrong cords from it, that although they bee long about it, yet as faint chapmen who are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſtill, for the ware which they would haue, but yet buy it not: euen ſo doe they. For when they haue been well counſelled to make haſte in ſeeking the Lord, as that which is beſt of all for them, yet profit or pleaſure, friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or feare holdeth them backe: who although in their heate and haſte, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſore driuen by ſicknes, tempeſts, feare of death, or the like occaſions, they doe raſhly purpoſe and proteſt, that they will neuer be the men, which they haue been; yet <hi>doe but how for a day</hi> (as it were) <hi>like the bulruſh, with the wind:</hi> and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16851:22"/>
therefore they are farre from the truth of it: But he of whom I here ſpeake,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> who hath ſo neerely and deeply looked into his eſtate (which the other haue not done) he (I ſay) cannot be drawne backe, to his former looſenes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſnes, nor holden and kept in it any longer by any torture, becauſe he well knoweth that none is like terrible to it.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be asked, what he is the better for his reſoluing: to the end it may more cleerely appeare, I anſwere, that when this is wrought in him, his heart is mollified, humbled and ſoftned, as <hi>Pauls</hi> was; who after hee ſaw that God ſet himſelfe againſt his going to Damaſcus to perſecute his Saints, and threw him down on the ground,<note place="margin">Acts. 9.6.</note> ſaid: <hi>Lord, what wilt thou haue me to doe?</hi> And when he is brought to this point, his heart is both full of relenting, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> for diſpleaſing God, though not in ſuch ſort as afterward it ſhall be, (which from another not hauing thus reſolued, is farre off) and is now <hi>an heart of fleſh,</hi>

And all this is wrought in him by the marueilous and ſecret operation of Gods holy ſpirit; who as he beginneth, and finiſheth the whole worke of his receiuing Chriſt; ſo doth he the middle part of the ſame: for it is not in any other, thus to bow and bend mans heart. Neither doth Gods ſpirit that onely, as with an hammer breaking and bruſing the clods of it, but alſo doth leade him further.</p>

                  <p>BVt what then? (ſome perhaps will ſay) do you affirme that theſe things can do a man any good without faith? (for of this nothing hath yet bin ſaid) and doe you affirme a man to be iuſtified (for ſuch an one is he who is in fauour with God) hauing no faith? or that any thing is accepted of God which he doth (as his deſire to bee forgiuen, his hungring after it, his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, acceſſe to God in prayer and confeſſion of ſinnes) all theſe being without faith? or if not ſo, do ye then ſay that we our ſelues muſt thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelues to receiue faith? but that is to attribute free will vnto man being yet in the eſtate of miſerie and bondage, and vnrenewed, as being yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> without faith. To the firſt I ſay, that although none of theſe be faith, yet I ſay, that they are not without it, as I will more fully ſhew afterward: neither that God is pleaſed with any man, neither he himſelfe is iuſtified, but only by it: but wee cannot diſcerne or ſet downe the very moment when faith is wrought: but when the other forenamed graces of God are effectuallie wrought in the heart, then is this of faith wrought alſo by the ſame ſpirit: neither can hee that hath receiued this faith into his heart, ſo certainly and eaſily iudge of it, as of thoſe other gifts which accompanie it. To the latter obiection, I anſwere, that I am farre from aſcribing to man vnrenewed, any inherent goodnes, whereby he may prepare himſelfe to receiue faith: he is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> I ſay, deſtitute of all goodnes in his will, and of power to doe good: ſuch graces are giuen him of God, as was ſaid before. For God findeth all <hi>men in their filthines and gore bloud,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſpeaketh:<note place="margin">Ezech. 16.6.</note> and ſhe whom he vouchſafeth to make his beloued ſpouſe (I meane his Church) he raiſeth out of the duſt, waſheth and clenſeth her from her filthines wherein hee found her, and then taketh her to him to delight in, as his deare and onely ſpouſe. It is the Lord therefore which is <hi>the author,</hi>

                     <hi>and finiſher of his faith</hi> who ſhall be ſaued: and he, as he hath abaſed him, and filled his heart with ſorrowes for the ſame purpoſe; ſo it is he that ſoketh it by little and little, and ſeaſoneth it in time with faith, hope, and comfort: This is his only worke. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And although it be hard to determine whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith is wrought (as I haue ſaid) and how long dreadfull feare continueth: yet by meanes of the knowledge of his miſerie, and redemption, God worketh them both in his heart, and that when, and in what manner it ſeemeth beſt to his wiſedome; ſo that it may be ſeene that it is ſo. And thus I hauing anſwered theſe two obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, I wil now proceed, morefully to ſhew how he guideth &amp; bringeth home this loſt ſheep, as I had in ſom ſort proceeded to do, before I was occaſioned to digreſſe a while, by reaſon of the two former queſtions now anſwered.</p>

And that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.7.8.</note> that when he began to ſee the beautie of this bleſſed meſſage, he counted thoſe things loſſe, which had been vantage to him, yea very doung for Chriſts ſake, that he might win him: the ſame is verified in all ſuch as I now ſpeake of, euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whoſoeuer he be: and then he is truly come home, no more to be caſt off or forſaken of the Lord. And this gracious affection is thus riuited into him, and as it were writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with an adamant pen, neuer to be raſed out any more, to the end it may alwayes after remaine and be found in him after experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: as it ſtandeth with great reaſon it ſhould: euen as it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was of a ripe age, full fortie yeares old, he did ſhew the fruite of it, as many other wayes, ſo this one: that <hi>he refuſed to be called the ſon of</hi> Pharaos

And this is faith, which making them inwardly perſwaded in ſome ſort by ſo cleere euidence,

(as I haue ſaid) cauſeth them outwardly in time to profeſſe the ſame more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> boldly, &amp; without feare, as occaſion ſhalbe offered: although it be for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time, both weake and faint, yet is it ſound and ſure; and after experience in a godly life (I meane the life that is led by faith) it ſhall be ſtrengthened, better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and procure withall, reſt to their ſoules. For where the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned graces are, as true contrition, the heart broken with ſorrow, and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hungring and pining for mercie and grace, confeſſing and forſaking the ſinne, with accuſation and deepe groanes for pardon; there is ſome true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſauing faith; for Gods graces are not ſeparated: for our Sauiour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth <hi>them bleſſed which haue theſe graces:</hi> but none are bleſſed without faith:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.4.5.

Which thing I doe the rather ſtand vpon to proue, ſeeing it is rather tried and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by theſe, then knowne by it ſelfe without other holy affections going with it, and for that many of tender age in Chriſt, and yonglings, cannot be certaine and throughly perſwaded that they haue faith, and conſequently, that their ſinnes are forgiuen them, and yet by infallible ſignes and tokens we know that it is ſo. I ſpeake of the leaſt meaſure of it: for of the ſtronger faith, the queſtion is eaſier. And the weakeſt meaſure of faith I call that, when an humbled ſoule longeth,<note place="margin">A deſcription of the ſmalleſt meaſure of faith.</note> and almoſt fainteth for Gods mercie in Chriſt; and although he be not aſſured of it, yet he ſeeth that it cannot be denied:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and therefore waiteth for it, and is ſtaied from deſpaire. I ſay he ſeeth that it cannot be denied, but that God doth graunt pardon to him againſt his ſin: becauſe he ſeeth himſelfe to haue obtained many graces and workes of the holy Ghoſt, which cannot be in a reprobate, as was ſaid before; and thereby he is holden from deſpaire and dreadfull feare. And yet through weaknes and want of experience cannot call God father, though he cannot ſuffer the contrarie thought to haue any place in himſelfe: and therefore the thing that he moſt laboureth to be ſatisfied in and reſolued of, is, that he may haue ſome cleerer light, and lay better hold of it, that Chriſt hath redeemed him indeed; yet is he as the child firſt taught to goe alone, who at the firſt is weake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in the ioynts, but in time can runne about: ſo ſhall it be with the ſoule which thus longeth and lamenteth after God.</p>
                  <p>This I haue ſpoken for their ſakes who more hardly doe lay hold on Gods mercie, and doe with more difficultie applie the promiſe to themſelues: the which to doe with all poſſible care, and not to be turned aſide from exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our ſelues ſoundly and throughly by any let, is a grace of the greateſt importance. And he is wiſe indeede, who will not ſtay before he haue it: which wiſedome God will teach them whom he loueth: for though many very ignorant and careleſſe hearers doe hardly, yea neuer come to any reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of faith; yet ordinarily, where people are ſoundly, cleerely and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> taught, it is otherwiſe: for (to ſpeake of them, who ſhall be ſaued) the word ſo preached,<note place="margin">How God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth faith.</note> by little and little ſoketh and diſtilleth into the hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them. And though they know not when this gracious worke of God was wrought, for the moſt part, as neither can we diſcerne and ſee the plants and hearbes when they ſhoote out, though in time wee ſee it is ſo: yet ſome there are, whom God in ſpeciall manner doth priuiledge at one time

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and in one day to receiue that grace, and gift of aſſurance, which others are long labouring and trauailing for, before they attaine it:<note place="margin">Luk. 19.9.</note> As our Sauiour Chriſt pronounceth of <hi>Zacheus: This day is this man become the ſonne of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and ſaluation is come into his houſe.</hi> So <hi>Lydia,</hi> and they in the Act. 2.37.<note place="margin">Faith vniteth to Chriſt.</note> And this is the faith whether it be weake or ſtrong which vniteth to Chriſt; and maketh them that haue it (which is a myſterie and riddle to the world) to haue and enioy their hearts deſire; yea and indeed more then they could deſire or thinke, namely, to be truly the children of God, and thereby happy. Euen the ſame faith, for which Chriſt pronounced <hi>Peter</hi> bleſſed: who when hee ſaw him but in baſe eſtate the ſonne of man, yet for the words which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Chriſt had ſpoken, and his miracles, had beleeued him to be alſo the ſonne of God, the annointed of the Lord, and his Sauiour, he pronounced this of him: <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon, for fleſh and bloud hath not reuealed it vnto thee,</hi>

Pet. 1.1.<note place="margin">Common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors haue not this faith.</note>) yet the common profeſſors and hearers of the Goſpell haue it not, becauſe they doe not looke that the Lord ſhould reueale it to them, without which they cannot haue it, but take counſell of their owne wiſedome and reaſon, which doe hinder and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hold them backe from it. For reaſon thinketh it an abſurd thing, and to bee laughed at, that a man ſimple in the world, &amp; a ſinner, eſpecially ſore burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his miſerie, and confeſſing the ſame, ſhould yet be more happie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and in his owne knowledge, then all the worlds good can make him: Mans wiſedome (I ſay) can neuer be perſwaded of this; but faith hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it for truth, and enioyeth ſuch an eſtate with good ſecuritie. And how God reuealeth any ſuch thing vnto men (which yet is plainly ſaid he did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Peter</hi>) they cannot tell nor ſee: except this be it, when they thinke and haue a good hope that it is ſo: as though ſuch a thing might be wrought in them, and they not know how, the change which it worketh being ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> or that God might reueale this ſecret myſterie of faith to them, &amp; they not aware of it; yea and that (which is more) eſpeciall ſignes accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>

But as wee truly ſay that man is faultie in this, that he openeth his eares, and giueth credit to Sathans deceitfull ſuggeſtions: ſo becauſe God did ſee what would come to paſſe thereby, he did therefore ſet watchmen, who ſhould giue his people warning thereof, namely, how Sathan holdeth them from beleeuing by ſome of his ſubtill traines, to the end they might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> preuent them: therefore wee muſt know that this fault,<note place="margin">Fault of not beleeuing in Miniſter and people.</note> whereby men are letted from beleeuing, is either in him who ſhould bring the tidings, that is, the watchman, who is the Miniſter; or in them who ſhould receiue the ſame, that is, the people and hearers: for if the lets be not remoued in both, faith is rarely, or not at all come by.</p>

For ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they would haue nothing to except againſt them, if they cannot finde thoſe accuſations, that are iuſt, they are content with any ſhew, why they ſhould refuſe to bee counſelled and perſwaded by them. And therefore, if they be old, they ſay, they dote, and know not what they ſay: if they be yong, they haue no iudgement nor experience: if they be wealthie, then they are couetous: if poore, then baſe and contemptible: if they be maried, they can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> not follow their callings, but the world: if vnmaried, then they liue ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly. And thus (to ſay no more) it is fearefull to ſee how little the people (in one reſpect or other) are ſeaſoned with the ſweete fruite of the Miniſterie: and therefore, if ye feare God, regard your owne welfare and peace, and will not come to iudgement, imbrace the Miniſtery reuerently, as Gods meſſage, and the greateſt and moſt lets of faith are remoued.</p>

Now who ſeeth not the difference betwixt theſe two, to be this, that the one <hi>is led by the ſpirit of God,</hi> whereby the father of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> doth reueale this ſecret myſterie of faith to him, and doth wonderfully draw his heart vnto it: the other is led by fleſhly reaſon, as his guide: which is the greateſt enemie to this worke? For our reaſon thinketh it vnneceſſarie to ſet more by that which we cannot ſee with carnal eyes, then by that which we haue in preſent poſſeſſion, and ſee it, handle it, enioy, and vſe it: therefore no man doing thus, is led by the ſpirit of God, which aſſureth him, who is led by it, that God hauing promiſed glorie greater then the world (though hee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16851:32"/>
ſeeth it not) he ſhall finde no leſſe, then is promiſed: therefore he ſetteth more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> by it, then by all things here before his eyes.</p>
               <p>And this is the way to beleeue in God indeede, though wee ſee him not, that by this our confidence in him, wee may haue ioy and peace. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this faith is counted farre more pretious then all worldly wealth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he who thus accounteth of it, will ſet himſelfe to ſeeke it willingly and readily,<note place="margin">Heart vpon Gods promiſes.</note> as I ſaid before. And therfore as the word teacheth him, he will haue his heart vpon the promiſes of God, becauſe they are his treaſure, muſing on them, vntill he hath al difficulties and doubts of any moment, remoued from him,<note place="margin">Gods will we ſhould beleeue.</note> which God for his part will not be vnwilling to graunt. And in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation he ſhall ſee that he is not more deſirous to beleeue, then God is that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> hee ſhould ſo doe: hee ſeeth that God, for his greater aſſurance of it, doth through loue intreate him:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.19. 1. Tim. 1.15. 1. Ioh. 3.13.</note> of friendſhip counſelleth him, and of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie being able to performe, commandeth him to beleeue: as if hee would hereby ſhew that none hath authoritie to hinder or forbid the ſame: He ſeeth further, that as hee may receiue this promiſe, hauing ſo ſtrong incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo he can no otherwiſe be ſaued, nor happie. All this hee ſeeing, and weighing deeply, beginneth to ſtay himſelfe, and to lay faſter and ſurer hold on eternall life: and ſeeth that it cannot otherwiſe be, but that he ſhould be ſaued, how farre ſoeuer he was from this perſwaſion before. And now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to conclude with himſelfe, that he is deliuered indeed from all feare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of hell, and the diuell: for hereby his heart is more humbled and meekened to be ſubiect to the will and gouenment of God, without which, this faith is not attained. To whom this counſell yet is to be giuen (though he be come to ſuch great preferment) that after hee hath by the forementioned meanes gotten this faith and confidence, that he beware of all occaſions which may darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or put out the light of it: As that he be not too bold to reaſon and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion againſt himſelfe for yeelding to this truth lately receiued, and beleeued of him, before he be well grounded, and haue gotten ſome experience, but follow his rule that guideth him:<note place="margin">Jf any doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ariſe.</note> for example, If any doubting ſhould ariſe, any lying ſpirit ſhould ſuggeſt, and trouble him with feare of falling away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> hereafter, or that he cannot tell whether he be predeſtinate or no, or that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue been as forward as hee, and yet haue in the end fallen from God, or any ſuch like: he is to be counſelled to hold them all for ſpirits of errour, and Sathans inſtruments to delude and terrifie him.

Secondly, how they may further proue, that they differ from ſuch as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16851:33"/>
are not beleeuers, although they ſeeme ſo. Of theſe weake ones, there are two <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſorts: ſome leſſe, ſome more: both ſhall be better vnderſtood by that which ſhall ſeuerally be ſaid of both. And herein I deſire my brethren, who are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſetled, not to thinke this labour ſuperfluous: but to meaſure the weake by their owne weaknes at their firſt beginning, and to thinke that as the gift of faith is moſt excellent, ſo there cannot be too great helpe yeelded to the weake, in directing them to come by it. Concerning the firſt therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I haue by ſundrie tokens ſhewed, who are the children of God, and how euery faithfull Chriſtian may iudge of himſelfe hereby; yet for want of experience, and by vehemencie of temptation, they cannot ſo boldly and confidently reſt, and ſtay themſelues by generall doctrine, nor applie it to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> themſelues; thoſe I meane which are weake Chriſtians, yet ſuch as haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained communion with their brethren in faith and godlines: therefore though the aforementioned properties of true beleeuers, may be cleerely ſeene and diſcerned to bee in them, and they themſelues alſo will confeſſe, that they haue been ſtaied (ſaue in temptation) and that ſome of them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haue found ſingular comfort in Chriſt, and deſire much to be with him: yet ſoone they are driuen from their hold, and cauſed to ſuſpect their comfort to be a vaine fancie, and ſo fall into much feare and doubting, that they are none of the Lords. They muſt know therefore, that ſeeing there is no <hi>ſhadow of changeablenes with God,</hi> that it is their owne weaknes ſo to think,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> as the Prophet confeſſeth of himſelfe in the like caſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.13.</note> after he had long wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ſtroue with that temptation: for he that hath been aſſuredly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Gods loue toward him at any time in his whole life, <hi>ought not to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his confidence</hi> after,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.35.</note> nor ſuffer himſelfe to be depriued of it, being his chief treaſure.<note place="margin">The firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a weake faith.</note> But though this may be a ſtay to a weake conſcience, who is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afflicted in this ſort; yet I ſay further, that ſeeing hee cannot be ſatisfied, till his doubtfulnes (which by all his might he ſeeketh to ſubdue) be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and his ſoule ſet at libertie againe by ſome new light in Gods promiſes: therefore he is to be perſwaded that he labouring after, and groaning to reſt his wearied and heauie heart on theſe, he cannot miſcarry, nor be forſaken of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the Lord in the loweſt depth of his diſtreſſe.<note place="margin">The ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a vveake faith.</note> For ſome one or other teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and propertie of the new birth ſhall euer be found in him, although hee alwaies feeleth it not, neither perceiueth it himſelfe; whereby it ſhall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that he liueth to God the life of God: euen as hearing, breathing, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, feeling, and ſuch like, are infallible tokens of life in the bodie, which by many likelihoods appeareth to be dead. And if to his owne iudgement it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that all hope is cut off through the rage of the diuell, and ſtrength of the temptation: yet it is, as if a man were ſuddenly ſtriken downe to the ground with ſome violent blow, and amazed, who yet afterward recouereth himſelfe againe: ſo that euen he, which feeleth not that he hath faith and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> life, is not yet without it, ſeeing hee is not without that worke of the ſpirit, which alwaies accompanieth it; although indeede he hath neede of eſpeciall and ſtrong comfort. And this is mine anſwere.</p>
               <p>But if this bee not enough, but thou wilt marueile, why God doth thus deale with thee, and ſuffer thee to fall to ſuch depth of doubting, ſorrow, and feare, although he loueth thee; yea and that after thou haſt felt ſuch comfort
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16851:33"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to thy conſcience: I muſt make mine anſwere more full and large, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfying of thee herein. I ſay therfore, although this be by the wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, that many of his truly begotten children (who therefore haue had ſound comfort in Chriſt) doe fall ſometimes, and that very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and do greatly wauer, and doubt oftentimes, and ſo become vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable; which the Lord diſpoſeth: leaſt by their ſudden chaunge from ſo damnable and vncomfortable an eſtate to ſo happie and ioyfull, they ſhould bee lifted vp, and conceited, and ſo become ſecure and preſumptuous (the forerunners and cauſes of a fearefull fall) yet this is certaine, it ought not thus to be on our parts: for it is (as I haue ſaid before) a weaknes, which muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be withſtood and ouercome. For the attaining whereto, the occaſion of this doubting in him who hath once beleeued, muſt be ſearched out, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued: which ordinarily is our own infirmitie, neglect of dutie, and ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the manner of performing the ſame, or ſome particular ſin; alſo prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to ſinne, a nouriſhing of the ſame and ſtrength of it, or long lying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: whereupon the tender conſcience feareth that his former comfort was but deceitfull and vaine, and ſo doubteth of his owne eſtate.</p>
               <p>For the right remouing hereof, this is duly to bee conſidered, that as the roote of our comfort in Chriſt is not the ſtrength of our Chriſtian life:<note place="margin">A third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a weake faith.</note> ſo the weaknes herein, ought not to breed doubting of our ſaluation by Chriſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> But for as much as all our comfort ſtandeth in this, that God, <hi>who iuſtifieth the vngodly,</hi> hath freely giuen his ſonne, and in him is reconciled to vs, who ſo heartily deſire his fauour, hauing been his enemies: and hath by his Goſpell called vs, and by his ſpirit wrought in our hearts a ſure perſwaſion hereof; wherby <hi>we which were dead in ſin,</hi> are made aliue to God, &amp; ſo are new borne: and therefore begin to be chaunged, firſt in affection, and then in conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by little and little. Therefore if we haue this aſſurance of our new birth, though there be in vs much weakenes of the ſpirituall life, yet we ought not to doubt, whether we be Gods children, ſeeing he that is new borne can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer die.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But rather wee are to remember firſt, wee are but children,<note place="margin">The fourth perſwaſion to vphold a weake faith.</note> and therefore weake. Secondly, we are very ſubiect to many ſpirituall diſeaſes; ſome ſuch as take away ſenſe of life: and therefore wee muſt ſeeke to be cured, and not deſpaire of life, becauſe it is certaine that no ſuch can periſh. So that if we ſee, that we haue turned our harts from our chriſtian courſe, &amp; offended God, or (which is more) if we haue ſuffered our ſelues to be ſeduced any manner of way, we muſt not deſpaire, or doubt of the ſafetie of the whole perſon, when any one part or member is diſtempered, and ill at eaſe; but cure it,<note place="margin">A fit ſimile.</note> and labour to reſtore that to health againe: as if it be thine heart, thine eye, thy hand, or any other part which hath offended; reſort thou to the Phiſition Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> make thy complaint, that thou art heauie, and wouldeſt faine returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from whence thou art fallen: and be confident for his owne promiſe ſake, who calleth with ſtretched out armes, ſaying, <hi>Returne thou which wandreſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſai 55.1. Matth. 11.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and thou who wouldeſt finde eaſe and comfort, come vnto me, and I will refreſh thee:</hi> beleeue in me, and I will ſatisfie thee in that which thou hungreſt for. Now if they who haue fallen and offended God, may turne home againe to their firſt husband with good welcome: ſhall not they much more be beloued of

him, and therefore comforted by him, who haue not prouoked him, but are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> onely held downe through feare and infirmitie?</p>
               <p>And thus I hauing anſwered the doubts of this ſort of Gods people, weak in faith: I had purpoſed to haue proceeded no further to deale with them <hi>which haue the ſeale of God,</hi> and which are marked to eternall life: but to haue diſcloſed the packe of counterfeits, and to haue proued that many ſuch, <hi>as ſay they are Chriſtians,</hi> and the elect of God, and are not, but doe lie; that they are nothing leſſe then the children of God (for as the weakeſt in faith muſt not be depriued of their priuiledge, as to thinke they are not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords: ſo muſt not the moſt glozing hypocrites be ſuffered to conceiue a falſe opinion or hope of that which is none of theirs: as to dreame of happines) This, I ſay, I had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> purpoſed next to haue entred into: but in the meane while, it commeth into my minde (by occaſion of ſuch, as I haue anſwered alreadie, that is, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; who hauing receiued much comfort through their hope, after an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling,<note place="margin">Another ſort weake in faith, and how they are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</note> haue yet after that, been troubled with doubtings) by occaſion of them (I ſay) I called to mind another ſort of Gods deare ſeruants, who are weaker then they, deeplier grieued, and therefore more tenderly to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: leaſt that they <hi>being bruſed reedes, ſhould be altogether broken, and as ſmoking flaxe ſhould be vtterly quenched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe are they, who hauing manifeſt ſignes of faith, and the new birth in them: yet by the ſubtill and cruell malice of the diuell (although not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the wiſe diſpoſing of the Lord, to their great good, and example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) are brought to this bondage, that they are perſwaded that they are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reprobates, and haue no remedie againſt their deſperation. They feele (they ſay) the wrath of God kindled againſt their ſoules: and anguiſh of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience moſt intolerable: and can finde no releaſe, notwithſtanding their continuall prayers made vnto the Lord, and in their iudgement ſtand voyde of all hope of the inheritance promiſed, expecting the conſummation of their miſerie, and the fearefull ſentence of eternall condemnation. Now this vehemencie of temptation, though it bee enough of it ſelfe barely, to ſhake and terrifie the afflicted; yet when melancholie ſhall herewithall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the partie, then is it made farre more grieuous: for that raiſeth exceſſe of diſtruſt, and feare, and perſwadeth it ſelfe of miſerie, where there is no cauſe, and is the very ſeate of the diuell, being an apt inſtrument for him, both to weaken the bodie, and to terrifie the minde with vaine and phantaſticall feares, and to diſturbe the whole tranquillitie of our nature: and one chiefe propertie of this, is to feare a man without iuſt cauſe. So many as are troubled with this latter, I exhort to reade the treatiſe of Melancholie, ſet foorth by Doctor <hi>Bright</hi> Phiſition, <hi>Anno</hi> 1586. vnto the which alſo I may referre them, for the former point: that is to ſay, if they be deeply touched with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſinne alone, how they may be comforted and deliuered out of it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> But ſeeing it is both appertaining to the matter which I haue taken in hand, to ſay ſomewhat thereof, and the other treatiſe not alway at hand, I wil part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borrow from thence, where it is largely and profitably ſet downe: and partly adde my ſelfe ſomewhat for the ſtaying and perſwading of ſuch weak ones,<note place="margin">Perſwaſions to the weake to vphold them.</note> as their caſe requireth.</p>
               <p>And firſt they muſt be perſwaded, that they are not vnder the wrath of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16851:34"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> God; neither is his anger kindled againſt them, for all their feare that oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, when their eſtate is to their owne feeling, euen at the worſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue not ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt: which ſinne onely is able to ſhut them out from hope of ſaluation; and yet many of them in their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation do thinke that they haue. And to proue that they haue not committed that ſinne, it may appeare by this: that they haue not maliciouſlie ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the truth and Goſpell of God: nor wilfullie perſecuted it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their conſcience, but doe imbrace it heartily, and loue the ſame, which they are not able to denie. But it is a meere deluſion and temptation of the diuell, which holdeth them in this terror and bondage: which time will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and lay open, as they themſelues ſhall hereafter moſt plainely ſee and diſcerne: which, many ſuch as they are, in the like caſe haue found in the end. And though it be a temptation of the enimie purpoſed of him to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion: yet from their louing and mercifull father a triall of their faith, and patience, and other vertues. Indeed the ground hereof, is their owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (as I ſaid before of the former ſort of Gods Children) vpon the which the diuell worketh, although not to wring from them their hope (which he ſhall neuer be able to doe:) yet to wearie their liues with heauines and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort.<note place="margin">Sathan wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon vs by ſuggeſtions.</note> And this our infirmitie Sathan doth ſometime aſſaie without meanes, that is, onely by ſpirituall ſuggeſtion: ſometime by meanes and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> occaſions of euill, and forcible perſwaſions to ſinne and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. For the firſt of theſe two, it is certaine, that he after a perſonall manner to the ſoule, though not in bodilie ſhape to the eye, without meanes of outward things, tempteth vs, in the very ſecret thoughts of our hearts. For he, being a ſpirit (and by creation moſt excellent) hath acceſſe vnto our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to trouble them, and diſorder all their actions: as we ſee corporall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with corporall and bodilie force to annoy one another. And as he is a ſpirit, ſo the long experience (which he hath of our corruption, and miſerie from age to age) giueth him knowledge of our minds more perfectlie, who gathereth it by the leaſt ſigne of our inclination and will: not that he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> our hearts (for that is proper to God only) but through his long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with our nature, he conceiueth our intents and purpoſes, and that oftentimes without ſignification, either of ſpeech or geſture. And thus he being able to diſcouer the vanitie of our minds, by the knowledge of our vniuerſall corruption: as he ſeeth occaſion, and whereto we moſt incline, he ſuggeſteth his temptations to ſinne and diſobedience.</p>
               <p>Now if to theſe two we adde his malice (for he is not called the enuious man for naught) and his vnſearchable ſubtiltie, and exceeding ſtrength;<note place="margin">Sathans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</note> and that which is greater then all the reſt, that he moſt hurteth, when it leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, when we leaſt ſuſpect it: for which cauſe it is ſaid, <hi>that hee changeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> himſelfe into an angell of light,</hi> 2. Cor. 11.13, 14. we ſhall not meruaile, though without any meanes, or outward occaſions, he raiſeth great terror, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maidnes, eſpeciallie the Lord giuing him leaue ſo to doe, for the good of vs which are exerciſed with them. For beſides that,<note place="margin">Sathan temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth to ſin, which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in.</note> we are inticed ſometime to the ſinnes, which by nature we loue: we are alſo (eſpeciallie ſuch as are thus brought low, in the anguiſh and bitternes of their ſoule) tempted to ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils as are very ſtrange, and ſuch as we abhor the very leaſt conceite of them;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16851:35"/>
and finde not the leaſt part of our nature to incline to them; though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> we complaine of great frailtie: as to haue thoughts to blaſpheme God, to be tempted; to lay violent hands on others, not moued thereto by any hate or malice; or to deuoure our ſelues, to diſpaire and diſtruſt of Gods mercie and grace: all which ſinnes with ſuch other, the partie hath neuer had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, when hee was yet ouertaken with ſome other ſinnes, and had his heart drawne after them indeed; and yet he is feared with the guiltines of thoſe,<note place="margin">He laboureth to dimme our knowledge, and the ſight of Gods grace in vs.</note> which he euer loathed. And when the diuell can faſten vpon ſuch as this weake perſon is, in this wiſe, he eſpeciallie laboureth to dimme their knowledge and iudgement, that they may haue no ſure hold of any point of doctrine, which may ſoundly comfort them, that thus he may, <hi>like a Lyon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> them</hi> more ſpeedilie: For when they cannot be perſwaded in their iudgement, that God can, or will pardon them, how are they able to deſire, or pray for it, when it ſhall be beaten into them, that they haue no faith, nor any better things in them than reprobates? how can they be moued to ſtirre vp that weake faith which they haue? no more can they deſire good meanes, as counſell, reading, or any ſuch like, when he hath ſtricken this deadly blow in their conſciences, that God hath forſaken them.</p>
               <p>And this be ſpoken of the diuels tempting the children of God (when, and whom it pleaſeth the Lord for their triall) and that without the helpe of outward meanes, or any occaſions to worke by: the which I purpoſed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſpeake of to no further end, but for the helpe of ſuch as are ſometimes decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and ſo oppreſſed after the ſame manner. Here is no fit place to ſatisfie them who would be glad to know more of this matter.</p>
               <p>To proceede therefore, and ſo to draw to an end herein: As he doth oft without any meanes, deepely faſten vpon the weake conſciences of Gods people, to feare and diſmay them; ſo doth he the ſame much more eaſilie by the helpe of outward meanes: ſo that, when he hath couered their hearts with darkenes, and brought them into a dreadfull feare of Gods wrath; and plucked their armour from them,<note place="margin">He troubleth much by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obiects.</note> whereby before they had reſiſted him, he holdeth them at this vantage, that euery thing which is before them, is made <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> matter to increaſe their diſtreſſed eſtate. And therefore if they ſee a knife, all their thoughts are to deſtroy themſelues; if they goe by water, they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently perſwaded to drowne themſelues; and ſo are they tempted to ſtrangle themſelues, if either the place giue them any occaſion, or the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith they ſhould doe it. So if they ſee any merry, their heauines is the more increaſed, ſeeing (ſay they) we ſhall neuer come out of deadly ſorrow and diſpaire: if they ſee a dogge, they wiſh that they were ſo: when they ſhould eate their meate, they thinke it wil increaſe their damnation; and dare ſcarcely take the meaneſt ſcraps to relieue nature: And if any Scripture be recited to them;<note place="margin">The obiections of the weake in temptation.</note> oh, it belongeth not to them, they ſay: they are paſt hope:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and whatſoeuer we anſwere them (be it neuer ſo fit for them, and to doe them good) yet they are neuer ſatisfied; but raiſe new obiections againſt themſelues, as being nothing ſatisfied by that which was ſpoken to them.</p>
               <p>It were infinite to ſet downe their ſpeeches and thoughts like vnto theſe, which I haue now mentioned; which the diuell draweth from them by ſuch occaſions, as he worketh by: but all this is (as we ſee) through their owne let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16851:35"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> goe their hold of Gods promiſes, and mercies in Chriſt: which yet ſometime they haue imbraced, and felt great comfort in; or at leaſt, could not deny, but that they had part in them. And it is the vnſpeakeable goodnes of God, that they are not vtterlie ſwallowed vp; but kept through his ſecret grace, though not ſeene of them: and that all other of his deare ſeruants, are not plunged into the ſame depth of diſtruſt and diſpaire, that there might be no one to comfort and counſell another; but diſcouragements on eueryſide.</p>
               <p>For it is not to be attributed to Sathan, or any want of ſubtiltie, readines to hurt, ablenes, malice and crueltie; that either the one ſort is at all preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or the other more freed from the like meaſure of languiſhing and feare, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> or (which is the ſenſeleſſe ſicknes and diſeaſe of this age, and farre more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous) from bold ſecuritie and preſumption: but (as I haue ſaid) the Lords keeping of them both: Neither is it any meruaile to vs (though it be not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of the vnbeleeuers) becauſe the Lord hath his eye euer vpon his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ones (as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh, Pſalm. 41.12.) <hi>That he may ſee that no hurt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them</hi>; euen as a mother hath her eye alwaies on the young child which beginneth to goe, that it get no knocks.</p>
               <p>But now to conclude, ye will aske, what remedies are to be vſed againſt ſuch ſore aſſaults? Firſt I ſay, that ſeeing their conſciences beare them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, how much theſe temptations are repugnant to their deſires and liking; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and chiefely raiſed and procured by Satan in them, who abuſeth their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie: therefore there is no cauſe, why they ſhould be ſo diſcouraged,<note place="margin">Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sathans temptations.</note> and out of heart, although he hath haled, and violentlie carried them to ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie; as though they had taken glorie in offending God: this (I ſay) let them marke, as ſoone as they be fit to heare it; and the rather, they are to count them to proceede from him, than from themſelues; becauſe they are ſuch, as are altogether contrarie to their former conuerſation, and to nature it ſelfe: and ſuch as haue no enforcement, nor inticement, but from him.<note place="margin">Further reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note> They are further to conſider, how much it doth diſpleaſe God; that they are remoued from their faith, and giue place to the ſpirit of error: and therefore they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſhould gather more godly boldnes and confidence in him, on the one ſide, and more ſtrength againſt Sathan, on the other ſide. For if God calleth and incourageth vs to truſt and beleeue in him: and we ſtanding in need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, would moſt gladly (as we will all ſay in ſuch a caſe) imbrace his promiſes made in <hi>Christ Ieſus, who is he, which ſhould hinder vs? If the Lord will iustifie and cleare vs, who ſhall condemne vs?</hi> Neither let them after all this, be ſtill obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that they feele ſmall ſtrength of faith and hope, as many of Gods deare children doe, for thereby the enemie may take great encouragement to their owne diſaduantage: for what if they feele not the ſweete taſte thereof,<note place="margin">What wee ſhould doe, when we feele not the ſweete taste of Gods mercies.</note> which ſometime they felt; ſhall they iudge therefore themſelues to be vtterly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thereof? If the ſoule be now ſicke, and taſteth not the ſweete meates of conſolation, which it was wont, was it therefore alwaies ſo? Will they meaſure themſelues by that which they preſently feele, when the ſoule hath loſt her taſte? Or rather by the times paſt (as the Prophet, by his example tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them in the like caſe) whileſt it ſtoode free from the diſeaſe of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they found comfort in the ſpirit, through an acceptable meaſure of faith.</p>

The ſame I ſay to other their obiections of like ſort, as I haue ſaid to theſe: As when they reaſon thus againſt themſelues, that they do not liue as Gods children doe, nor ſo holily, as God requireth, and therefore they cannot haue ſuch comfort, as they haue.

I anſwere, neither doe any of Gods children at all times feele it: but that they may ſee their owne frailtie, God doth, as it were, hide himſelfe ſometime for a ſeaſon (as the mother doth from the child to try the affection of it to her) that they may with more earneſt deſire mourne for Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted grace: and when they haue obtained it againe, may with more ioyfulnes of heart praiſe him: and yet God doth not withhold comfort from his, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> times,<note place="margin">Deut. 33.12.</note> when they walke heauily, who (if they could giue credit vnto him) may aſſure themſelues that they may liue in ſafetie vnder his protection all the day long: but their owne frailtie, and the vehemencie of the temptation, which oppreſſeth them,<note place="margin">A ſeuenth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.</note> diminiſheth the feeling thereof.

               <p>And firſt whereas ſome may maruaile, that I in the deſcribing of Gods children, haue not reſted in theſe as infallible markes thereof, namely, 1. ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their miſerie, 2. confeſſion of their ſinnes to God, 3. feare of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for the ſame, and 4. deſiring ſome kinde of amendment of life; ſeeing they are alſo in them, who are effectuallie called of God: I anſwere, I haue followed the Scripture herein, and that I haue in ſhewing who are the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Lords, made mention, rather of thoſe graces of God, which are properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the faithfull, then of them, which may be in hypocrites, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hearted profeſſors.

But no meruaile, for many are the ſleights, by the which the diuell keepeth his poſſeſſion in ſuch, as are not yet eſcaped his wiles and ſnares, in the which he holdeth them; not without their own good liking. He diſcourageth ſome from hope and confidence, that they are the Lords; becauſe they haue been more deepely pricked for their ſinne, and longer holden in doubtfulnes, then other of Gods children are; and that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> none haue ſo great temptations and conflicts, as they haue: But haue not they theſe afflictions to bring them vnto God?<note place="margin">How men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions through Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans vviles.</note> And others he diſmaieth, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnder with the contrarie: as that they cannot be Gods children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue neuer had that deepe ſorrow, and long lying in it, for their ſinne, as many of their brethren haue had: As though mens examples, and not rather Gods word ſhould be their rule to follow.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſome others, that their eſtate could not be good, ſeeing they haue not had their liues full of ſome outward croſſes, as ſome of the godly haue: and yet on the contrarie, many haue been long holden captiues with theſe cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they durſt not thinke themſelues to belong to Gods election,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.13, 14.</note> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are euery while vnder one croſſe or other. Thus the diuell (whoſe malice and ſubtiltie few doe know, fewer doe well weigh, but feweſt of all doe wiſely and carefully reſiſt) the diuell, I ſay, holdeth numbers occupied about theſe and ſuch like points: wherein the triall of their happines, and certaintie of their peace doth not conſiſt. And becauſe religion and holie doctrine doth affect them, and that he ſeeth they will needes imbrace the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſame, he laboureth to keepe them at this ſtay, to hold themſelues contented with that ſhadow, though they be vncertaine of their eſtate to Godward, and remaine in ſuſpence and little hope of their ſaluation: and ſo hee permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to haue the letter of the Scripture in their mouth, and to talke ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally about religion, or (if occaſion be offered) about ſome queſtions,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.16.</note> and matters concerning the ſame; <hi>but they hate vtterly to be reformed.</hi> Who ſeeth not that he holdeth theſe in errour and bondage, as groſſely as he doth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before mentioned?<note place="margin">Looke to that which is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall.</note> who trouble themſelues about opinions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, which are not the chief and maine points to occupie themſelues about; as though happines conſiſted in them, but may faile of eternall life (for all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that) when they haue all done?</p>
               <p>For neither doth this commend a man to God, whether he hath long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in griefe of minde, feare of conſcience, and doubtfulnes of ſaluation: but that he be well freed and deliuered from ſuch trouble, and diſcharged of his feare: I meane that hee can heartily thanke God through Ieſus Chriſt, that he ſeeth and feeleth himſelfe ſet at libertie, and by him is made happie: for if the truth of God and his promiſe make him free, then he is free indeed.<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.32.</note> Neither is this with a man, or againſt him in aſſuring himſelfe of ſaluation, whether his life be full of afflictions and croſſes, ſeeing God keepeth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, an euen hand in theſe things; for they are common both to good and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> bad: but that a man know himſelfe, though a wretched ſinner; yet through faith, <hi>to be iuſtified and acquitted before God</hi>: and therefore <hi>is at peace with God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> in himſelfe, <hi>euen ſuch as paſſeth all vnderſtanding,</hi> whether his croſſes bee many or few.</p>
               <p>There are many things of like ſort, with which Sathan doth blindfold ſundrie of good hope: as that, for hauing ſome infirmities, or falles breaking foorth in them, therefore they cannot be beloued of God: and when they finde that in ſome ſort they can ouercome them, then they think they are the beloued of God: in neither of which a man is to place his ſafetie. For both the deare Saints of God may poſſibly be led out of the way,<note place="margin">When a man is none of the worſt, he may be farre from being good.</note> to commit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> offenſiuely: neither is he to promiſe well to himſelfe, who ſometimes keepeth from ſinnes, which at other times he hath fallen into: for it may be, that there is no great occaſion offered him that way; or he is otherwiſe bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, ſo as he is not ſo eaſily carried after ſuch temptations; or ſome ſinnes of another ſort as grieuous, doe hold him vnder. And therefore ſeeing many are deceiued this way, partly for want of knowledge and grounded iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the truth, and partly whiles they haue through long cuſtome been
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16851:39"/>
detained and holden in ſuch ſnares, they are to be deſired in the moſt earneſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> manner, that they would beſtow ſome of their time and meditations about the ſubſtance and marrow of their happines, to ſee that they haue a part in it indeed:<note place="margin">1.

               <p>And if they can be certified, that the ſpirit of God ſince, and through their hearing of his Goſpel preached vnto them, <hi>hath ſhed ſuch grace into their harts,</hi> as to make them partakers of the fruites thereof, they ſhall not neede to bee troubled about the other: and if they contrariwiſe finde that they doe yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> want theſe, they muſt fully purpoſe to ſeeke for them; and not to feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with a vaine and a deceitfull hope, ſtaied vpon no good ground nor foundation at all.</p>
               <p>And here I muſt further require, that ſuch as, to whom God giueth any worke of his ſpirit, and whoſe hearts he ſeaſoneth with good affections and deſires through the Goſpell, ſo as they ſenſibly feele themſelues to looke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eternall life, that they would cheriſh, and make much of theſe holy ſparks of grace kindled within them: and whiles they bee warme in them, to blow them vp euery while, with the bellowes of feruent prayer, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame them by acquaintance, companie, and conference with ſuch, as in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> whom they ſee God hath wrought the ſame things before them; and in greater meaſure, then in themſelues: alwaies highly reuerencing Gods gifts in them,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.2.</note> that they may the ſooner come by them: and that the things which they ſee but dimly, they may behold more cleerely, and their doubts may be reſolued to them, and they may finde comfortable incouragement to goe forward.<note place="margin">Let the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaied ones vſe all meanes to be conuerted.</note> But eſpecially, they muſt giue attendance daily and diligently to the doctrine of faith and godlines, where they may enioy that ſoundly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto them: aſſuring themſelues that if they finde not that <hi>the one thing aboue all things,</hi> chiefe and neceſſarie, they loue it not, as <hi>Mary</hi> did, Luk. 10.42. and then they ſhall not haue their part in it. But otherwiſe they may know,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that God, who doth ſhew himſelfe kind and louing to ſuch as ſeeke him not, (as it is written,<note place="margin">Eſai. 65.1.</note> 
                  <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not</hi>) will not hide himſelfe from them which doe ſeeke him; ſeeing he findeth all in their filth, when he calleth them to repentance, euen the beſt. And finally, they muſt waite vpon him, deſiring him in his good time (notwithſtanding their vnworthines) to draw them by his ſecret grace vnto him. But this ſhall ſuffice to haue bin ſaid of them who thinke themſelues Chriſtians and are not, but doe lie: and of them who haue left their firſt loue of the Goſpell and of their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ſometime (as it ſeemed) they had. Which two being of the forwardeſt ſorts of profeſſors, who goe for true beleeuers, and yet being none indeede, doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> iuſtifie the eſtate of the weakeſt ſeruants of God, to be approued of him and happie, being farre different from them. Which although I haue by the way as it were ſpoken to admoniſh both: yet principally and moſt chiefly, I haue done it, for the vpholding &amp; comfort of Gods weake ſeruants, who may ſee him moſt louing and gracious vnto them euen in that, I meane their abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and humiliation: which they ſometime thought to be their vtter and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16851:39"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> extreame miſerie. And thus much of the ſecond point of the ſecond part or generall head: namely, of the ſtaying of the weake Chriſtians, and how they differ from vnbeleeuers.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue, not as I would, but as I could,<note place="margin">The third head</note> ſet downe my meditations vpon this firſt point, to ſhew, who are the true people of God, and giuen oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to many, who haue little to ſay for themſelues, why they ſhould claime any right or title in that great purchaſe, to conſider of their eſtate more deeply and ſeriouſly then they haue done. If theſe, who are almoſt Chriſtians, and (as I may ſay) not farre from eternall life, being many of them vſuall hearers of Sermons, would inquire about their eſtate, till they ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſee it good, as I am ſure the other may bee well ſtaied by this which I haue written, I ſhould not be a little comforted, whom for their good (which I heartily deſire and pray for) this I beſeech to heare me in. What wiſedome ſhall they ſhew, to be careleſſe in ſo weightie a matter as this is, concerning their ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that their care in matters tranſitorie can neuer be enough? or what ſound comfort doe they looke for, whiles they reſt but in vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about the aſſurance thereof, which yet to miſſe and goe without, is their vtter and perpetuall deſolation? But they hope they are in good caſe, and perſwade themſelues that they are in the eſtate of grace. I am farre from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying it them: I would to God that I could hope ſo too.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> But what euidence or proofe haue they of it? They can anſwere, none, but this, that they profeſſe Chriſt, and loue the Goſpell, and contemne Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie. They heare Sermons oft, and thinke not well of them who doe not ſo. Some of the forwarder ſort, doe thinke verely ſometime, that they beleeue, and ioy therein, and ſometime weepe at a Sermon: but this is their anchor that they hold themſelues by, long after: when they be able to ſpeake of ſuch times and actions done in them. But when they haue been at the beſt, haue they then put foorth themſelues a little further, to demaund: are theſe things ſufficient markes and teſtimonies of our ſaluation? or if they be not, do they inquire what be? And do they not ceaſe trying their ſtate, till they can proue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it to be good indeed? and vntill they finde reſt to their ſoules that cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them? Nay rather, they come not to this at all, that they can applie Chriſt to them: that ſtudie is vtterly vnwelcome to them and vnſauourie. They can doe any thing but that: and why ſo? Verely, euen to the end they may be deceiued: as men that haue matter at law, and are in ſute, boaſt much of their caſe, but yet are very loath to come to triall of it: and why are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid ſo to doe, but for that they know they haue no good euidence to ſhew for it?</p>
               <p>They may be compared in this, to King <hi>Nabuchadnezzar:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 4.26.</note> he was very earneſt to heare the interpretation of his dreame, and could not be ſatisfied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vntill he heard the ſame. But this was not all that behooued him to doe. For when he ſaw that God gaue him twelue moneths to repent of his pride (for the which, his dreame told him his kingdome ſhould depart from him) he forgot his dreame like a dreame, and did not repent, but at the twelue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths end began a freſh to increaſe his pride, crowing and boaſting of his wealth and honour, thus: <hi>Is not this great Babel, which I haue built, for the houſe of my kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my maiestie?</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16851:40"/>
we ſee, that he was more deſirous to know what his dreame meant, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to bee warned by it: Euen ſo, theſe profeſſors (which I ſpeake of) are very carefull to heare the glad tidings of the Goſpell preached, and cannot bee withdrawne or diſſwaded from it: but to lay their eſtate with it, and to take this warning by it, that they will receiue the print of it vpon their hearts and liues, and bee caſt into the mould of it; that (I ſay) they cannot be brought vnto: for then they ſhould finde it to be the power of ſaluation to them, for the which end it is preached.</p>
               <p>But what is the cauſe that they going ſo farre before many other, who are profeſſors alſo, cannot be brought to goe beyond them in this as well? and herein to be equall to the beſt louers of the Goſpell?

They caſt not away their confidence, if they once grow to ſee what recompence of reward it hath:<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.35. Reuel. 3.11. Iohn 1.12. 1. Cor. 14.1 Matth. 15.6.</note> nor <hi>will not ſuffer any to take their crowne from them,</hi> euen their honour that they haue in being the Lords ſonnes and daughters. <hi>They couet ſpirituall things, they hunger and thirſt after righteouſnes:</hi> they with good and honeſt hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the word, and bring foorth fruite in due ſeaſon.<note place="margin">Luk. 8.15.</note> They if they haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their moſt louing father,<note place="margin">Cant. 3.3.</note> cannot be quiet till they returne and come home againe, and ſay, wee haue ſinned. And if they be in worſe eſtate then this, they like it not, vnleſſe it be when they are fallen aſleepe,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.2.</note> and haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> themſelues.</p>
               <p>And yet what doe they in all this, more then they ought? feeling for all this, their wants and burdens, of which they complaine and crie out. And whereas they are mocked and euill ſpoken of, for this, that they doe thus car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie themſelues in the loue of heauenly things, and in the hope of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, farre more feruently then they who are not intitled to any ſuch thing: it is hard to ſay, whether they who offer them this iniurie, doe moſt offend in hindring the honour of God thereby, or their neighbours welfare,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.27.</note> or their owne ſaluation? For God commaunds, that wee ſhould labour rather for the foode that abideth to eternall life, then for that which periſheth. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> what doe we offend then, who doe ſo? and is it not our gaine and benefit, if we doe ſo? Therefore let men for ſhame, and feare of iuſt damnation, deſiſt from ſuch madnes.</p>
               <p>But to returne to them to whom I ſpeake, and to conclude in a ſentence or two to them, and ſuch as they are: I ſay therfore, giue no reſt to your ſelues, till you can prooue that you be in the eſtate of ſaluation: You haue many waies ſet downe, by which you may doe it, euen in this treatiſe; in other god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mens labours; and eſpecially in the Scriptures. Loſe not all your labour which you haue beſtowed in ſeeking to be ſaued: I meane your reading, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Sermons, praying, and confeſſing your ſinnes (it is loſt, if you attaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not that which you ſeeke.) You are not farre from it, a little more humilitie and truth of heart, will bring you further into the eſtate of happines, then that ye can fall any more from it. Be neuer ſatisfied, till ye haue more then an vnrepentant perſon can haue. You count it no toyle to ſweate in hay and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt: This is another manner of ſubſtance; if ye once had part in it, ye would not forgoe your portion for a kingdome. And thinke this of me, who am not aſhamed to be ſaid to haue giuen you this counſell, I know what I ſay in thus prouoking, and labouring to perſwade you: if ye refuſe, neuer looke to come to the like offer. And to you, and as many as deſire ſaluation,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.70.</note> how farre off ſoeuer as yet ye be; know that ye are in the eſtate of diuels,<note place="margin">2. King. 2.13.</note> if ye continue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as ye be: and ye are the liker to continue ſo, the longer ye liue, if while ye be called, ye refuſe. You are as outlawes: Gods care reacheth not to you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are you vnder his protection, being his enemies; but he or ſome of his ſergeants will arreſt you, when you thinke not of it: and hell will receiue you; and the happines which other ſhall haue, will flie from you: which God forbid.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I haue ſpoken of thoſe, who are weakeſt in faith, and haue the ſmalleſt meaſure of it, and haue laboured to ſtay them in their temptation: I haue alſo ſhewed the cauſes of their conuerſion, <hi>the loue of God the father in giuing his ſonne:</hi> the loue of the ſonne in reconciling them to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering them from all their miſerie: the word of promiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> preached to bring them tidings of this: Gods ſpirit, aſſuring them by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king faith in them, and perſwaſion thereof: (and to this end I haue ſet down theſe, becauſe in the ordinarie comming to eternall life, there is no other way:) yet ſeeing theſe are not ſo eaſilie felt of vs, as they are ſure and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible groundes in themſelues, to vs of ſaluation: therefore I will adde ſome other effects, or rather properties of true faith, which doe accompanie the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the loue of God, and of Chriſt Ieſus in vs, and are the workes, or fruites of the holy Ghoſt by the Goſpell, which, although they be not of like authoritie with the former; yet are they eaſilier felt to be in vs. So that both ſorts of euidences laid together, and meeting and concurring in one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and the ſame perſon, ſhall giue him moſt cleerely to vnderſtand, that as God hath graciouſlie beſtowed it; ſo we may effectuallie receiue and hold it as our owne: and that with more certaintie euery day, as <hi>our ſaluation ſhall euery day be neerer, then when we first beleeued.</hi> And thus I come vnto the third gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall part of this treatiſe; wherein (ſeeing I hope the weakeſt beleeuers are or may be ſomewhat ſtaied by that which I haue ſaid already) I now purpoſe in this laſt part, to ſhew how all ſuch of Gods people, as are ſtaied from ſtrong feare &amp; trouble of mind; may by other cleere euidences, haue further proofe and triall of their faith, and be able to preſerue and confirme it, and how much ſuch an eſtate is to be deſired for the benefit it bringeth. And firſt, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> teach the beleeuer to trie that he hath this excellent gift of faith, theſe eyght graces being companions of it, and more eaſilie perceiued and diſcerned, then faith it ſelfe, will cleerely teſtifie that where theſe be, there ſhall that be found alſo.</p>

                     <hi>The firſt inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of faith, is ioy.</hi> 1. Cor. 1.3. Rom. 5.5. 1. Pet. 1.8.</note>This true beleeuer therefore whoſoeuer he be: firſt, as ſoone as he ſhall perceiue that God (farre otherwiſe then he looked for) hath giuen him his ſonne to bring life vnto him, and to be <hi>his wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> he muſt needes feele in his heart great ioy and comfort, as we ſee in the example of the Eunuch, when <hi>Philip</hi> had conuerted him, he <hi>went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way reioycing,</hi> Acts 8.39. and in Samaria, where when he had preached Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> there, and had brought them to repentance, <hi>there was great ioy in the Citie,</hi> Acts 8.8. And what maruaile? for how can a man be perſwaded by good and infallible grounds, that greater happines is giuen him of God then all the world is worth,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 126.1.</note> but he muſt needes reioyce with ioy vnſpeakeable, <hi>as they which dreame?</hi> For is there any naturall man ſo ſenſeles, that if he ſhould vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that ſome portion of goods, as an hundreth pounds value by the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16851:41"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> yeere, were befallen him; yet he ſhould not feele his heart made ioyfull there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at? and can this honour befall any (that he is highly in fauour with the Lord of heauen and earth, and thereby of <hi>a child of wrath,</hi> made heire of heauen for euer) but it muſt needes glad his heart exceedingly, and raiſe ſenſible ioy in him, which cannot be expreſſed? <hi>as in him who found the pearle.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 13.44.</note> But doe common profeſſors thus, or worldlings? when they manifeſtly bewray that they are glutted with the tidings of it? So that, as the Eunuch before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, immediatly after he had been inſtructed in this myſterie of faith, <hi>went on his way reioycing</hi>;<note place="margin">Act. 9.17. &amp; 19.</note> and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſoone after his conuerſion was marueilouſly comforted, although before as farre from it, and as deepely caſt downe as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſo let it not be doubted of, but when God hath once inlightened the heart of any (which before ſate in darkenes) to ſee himſelfe vndoubtedly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but that it raiſeth vp in him <hi>ioy vnſpeakeable, and glorious</hi> in his meaſure.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Indeede it ſhall not perhaps ſo much be ſeene, or appeare to another, as by good euidence it is felt of himſelfe. Neither ſhall a ſtranger, that is, a man otherwiſe affected, be partaker of this ioy: but that it accompanieth them, who are by faith made aſſured of their election; our Sauiour Chriſt teacheth,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.20.</note> ſaying, <hi>Reioyce not that the ſpirits are ſubdued vnto you, but rather reioyce becauſe your names are written in heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas it may be obiected, that it is ſore ſhaken and ſlaked by afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> let that trouble none: for <hi>no affliction for the time preſent is ioyous, but grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous:</hi> and yet we <hi>reioyce euen in them through hope, that maketh not aſhamed,</hi> Rom. 5.4. Beſides, we haue it here but in part, as we haue all other graces: and yet affliction (after we haue been exerciſed with it aright) ſhall make our ioy the greater in the end;<note place="margin">Hebr. 12.11.</note> when Gods former graces ſhall be reſtored to vs, <hi>which we were wont in him to finde:</hi> therefore Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Though ye haue not ſeene,</hi> yet <hi>ye loue him: in whom (though ye ſee him not) yet ye beleeue in him, and reioyce with ioy vnſpeakeable.</hi> Now ſeeing it muſt needes be thus, it may well proue to vs, that the common opinion of faith, which moſt haue where the Goſpell is preached; namely, that they beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them, and is nothing leſſe then true. For were they perſwaded of their happines, how could they chuſe but feele withall, their ſoules more ioyfull and glad within them, then all the commodities of this life could make them? For we no ſooner know <hi>our ſelues iuſtified before God by faith;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.1. Iohn 14.27. &amp; Philip. 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>but we are at peace with him: and ſuch peace as paſſeth all vnderſtanding.</hi> Which after we know how ſweete and pretious it is, we will by no meanes forgoe againe: although for want of ſtronger faith and ſounder knowledge, it is more flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſome: and yet euen that maketh them complaine, vntill they be inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and he that hath not this witneſſe within him, ſhall not doe beſt to ſooth vp himſelfe with a vaine confidence. Thus I conclude, that ioy and peace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> are inſeparable companions of faith.</p>
               <p>But here me thinkes, I heare ſome obiecting thus. If you zealous folke, who glorie ſo much of the aſſurance of ſaluation, and for that very cauſe be ſo ioyfull, ye agree not within your ſelues: for ſome which are of your mind, are euer ſad and ſorrowfull? To this I anſwere, that many deſire to be ſure, and grone for it, in the Lords eares; and in time, ſhall be comforted, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready pronounced <hi>to be bleſſed:</hi> and ſometime they are aſſured for a ſeaſon,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.4.</note>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:16851:42"/>
and then are cheerefull: and before this, they cannot be ſo, as they, whoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> hearts the Lord hath opened more cleerely to behold that excellent myſtery. But further I ſay, that it ſhould trouble no wiſe bodie to ſee them mourne for a while after that, which ſhall (being atteined) make them merrie for euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And it is a meere cauill in them, that twit Gods weake ſeruants for that which giueth ſo iuſt cauſe of mourning, namely their doubting, ſeeing they deſire nothing more then to be aſſured. And if they doe not mixe their feare and heauines with melancholy paſſions, they offend not in lamenting after God, while they long aboue all things, to behold Gods louing countenance towards them: But if their heauines make them waſpiſh, tuchie, froward, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, &amp; raſh in cenſuring them who are not in their eſtate; I ſay theſe as mad <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and frantike paſſions are to be condemned. But theſe obiecters ſay, that this ſad countenance and behauiour in them, who are more religious than the moſt part of others, cauſeth many to ſhun religion, and to be afraide to ioyne themſelues to their acquaintance and company, and to meddle with muzing on the Scriptures, or on Sermons, more then to heare and reade them, and ſo trouble themſelues no further. To this I ſay, that we are not ſo to looke to exemples, that we hurt and hinder our ſelues thereby from that benefit, which the Scriptures doe moſt certainely direct vs vnto. But if men would weigh things indifferently, they who are ſo ready to challenge many good Chriſtians for their heauines (which yet they know tendeth to the ſeeking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of comfort) might ſee their owne fault greater, whoſe mirth for the moſt part is ioyned with lightnes and profanenes, holding goodnes and grace out of the company,<note place="margin">Ierem. 9.23. Luk. 10.20. Eccleſ. 7.8.</note> and not a reioycing for that they know God to be their moſt louing father; without which, their ioy is but follie, <hi>yea madnes</hi>; as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>laughter,</hi> which teſtifieth ſuch ioy. But to end this in few words, let ſuch as haue true hope in God, though weakely, moderate their heauines, that they may offend as few as they may: and they that finde fault with them for that, let them know, that they ought rather to pitie and pray for them, and interpret all in the beſt manner, and looke that their owne mirth and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes be well warranted them, or elſe it were farre better for them to haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> part in the others heauines. And for anſwere to this, thus much.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſecond companion of faith; holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</note>But to goe forward; as the due conſideration of the greatnes, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the certaintie of his benefits, will raiſe this ioy in the heart of him that poſſeſſeth it: ſo likewiſe it will cauſe him to maruaile with reuerence, to ſee his ſtate ſo changed; himſelfe to be brought from ſo lowe a depth of extreame miſerie, to ſo high a degree of honour and glorie: and ſo to be enriched by this fauour of God, that he ſhall oft feare on the ſuddaine, leaſt it ſhould not be ſo, wondring at the greatnes of the ſame: as <hi>Iudas</hi> the good Apoſtle did, who conſidering the great kindnes of Chriſt, brake forth into theſe words:<note place="margin">Iohn 14.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord, what is the cauſe, that thou wilt reueale thy ſelfe to vs, and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to the world?</hi> Yea, and the woman of Samaria, which had long lien in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſuperſtition, and in the fruites of both, that is, in cauilling and mocking; yet when our Sauiour had ouercome her euill with good, and conuerted her, her heart was ſo ſet on the benefit which ſhe receiued by him, that ſhe forgat her water-pot (which in her, who ſauoured before only of the earth, was a great matter) and went, admiring at her owne change, to tell her
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16851:42"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> neighbours of that welcom newes, which had befallen her, and was a meane of their conuerſion alſo, Ioh. 4.28.29. But <hi>Sauls</hi> conuerſion did ſo cauſe him to wonder at Gods worke therein, that it cauſed alſo them that beheld it to admire it &amp; to be amazed, when they <hi>ſaw him preach the doctrine, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purſued,</hi> with the imbracers of it, Act. 9.21. So great admiration doth this precious faith worke in them that obtaine it. And yet if this holie and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent admiration at ſo great good things befallen thoſe, or other ſuch, ſhould but then onely immediatly after the receiuing of them be felt, the benefits might ſeeme the ſmaller: but it is farre otherwiſe, if it be duly nouriſhed and maintained: for they are ſo ſweete, and ſo farre <hi>aboue all that they can aske, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> looke for,</hi> that except it bee through mens owne default, they are euery day new and freſh, and ſo farre from bringing tediouſnes, that the oftner they be daily conſidered, and the longer they be inioyed,<note place="margin">Gods ſauour the longer it is inioyed, the ſweeter.</note> the more they will cauſe wondring at the loue of the giuer, and what ſhould moue him to beſtow ſo great a portion (euen more then the whole world) vpon ſo vnworthie an one, as would haue thought a little before, that it had been an happie eſtate, not to haue been at all. The Sunne in the beautie and ſtrength thereof, doth not more cauſe the eye to dazle, then the viewing and beholding of this glorie, which God communicateth with his beloued ones, doth aſtoniſh and abaſh the heart to thinke of it: which is ſo true that <hi>Dauid</hi> the man of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> God, did many yeeres, after hee felt himſelfe beloued of God, fall into this holie admiration, as that <hi>God ſhould doe ſuch great things for his ſoule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 116. v. 8.139.34.</note> 
                  <hi>as deliuer him from the neathermoſt graue,</hi> by which he meant hell.</p>
               <p>And therefore it cannot be without groſſe bewitching of many profeſſors by Sathan, that if they haue, at the hearing of this tidings publiſhed, meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a little, they thinke they haue receiued this benefit with that reuerent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that it deſerueth, though after it waxeth a common thing with them: for this they ſay, it were fooliſh daily to bee wondring at one thing, as when we firſt heard of it.</p>
               <p>Full well all ſuch declare what fruite they reape by it: but if they did daily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conſider their vnworthines, they ſhould ſee more cauſe to wonder euery day, then at the firſt, if compariſon may bee made in ſuch a caſe: It is to be wondred at, that God pardoneth ſinnes daily, in that his mercie continueth daily to pardon them, and for that it being ſo great,<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.4.</note> ſhould bee ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring alſo. For who can thinke vppon his ſlippes, and rebellions (I ſpeake of the beſt of vs) which breake foorth from him daily, for the which the wrath of God is iuſtly prouoked againſt him; and what might bee feared thereby, and how notwithſtanding them all, hee may come to God for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge by Chriſt, and bee without feare, as if hee had not ſinned:<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.2.</note> yea and hold faſt his confidence, that God yet loueth him: who (I ſay) can conſider <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this, but hee muſt needes bee aſtoniſhed at the inioying of ſo great kindnes; when a curſed man, no better then ourſelues, muſt be ſued vnto, and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by vs, and all the friends that we can make, and being diſpleaſed, muſt be pacified with gifts, and yet hardly holden from vexing, impriſoning, and purſuing vs to the death, and may not be intreated? Therefore <hi>magnifie the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindnes of our God for euer, euen as it indureth for euer,</hi> Pſalm. 118.4. For though naturall reaſon, euen fleſh beare a great ſtroke in this matter: yet wee
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16851:43"/>
are not debtters to it: and we haue great cauſe whiles we liue, to doe this.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               </p>
               <p>So that, although I confeſſe, that in nature it is otherwiſe, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alwaies admire the greatnes of ſome rare deliuerance, or fortunate eſtate befallen him by his friend, which at the firſt raiſed great admiration; yet it ought to be farre otherwiſe with the ſpirituall man being a beleeuing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: he, I ſay, hauing the louing countenance of God ſhining daily vppon him as before, which is a treaſure vnualuable, ſhould wonder at the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it; eſpecially ſeeing he prouoking the Lord with his ſinnes daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, might therefore feare that ſuch former comforts as had been inioyed, might haue been turned into as great ſorrowes, and his light into darknes, rather then be continued and multiplied. And this he ſhall do, vnles through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> vnthankfulnes (the corruption of nature leading him thereto) hee burie the ſame in obliuion, and begin to affect too much, and to bee ouer neere glued to things preſent and temporarie, ſetting the creature before the Creator, and the gift before the giuer. For thereby, he ſhall (no doubt) ſlacke his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing at that kindnes of God, that hath neuer end, although it be moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: whereas otherwiſe, he ſhall be able from day to day, to beare downe all tranſitorie things before him, with the eſtimation and high prizing of it. And this of the ſecond companion of faith, namely, holy admiring the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Gods kindnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of faith, loue.</note>But that I may not dwell vpon this matter, who haue purpoſed but in brief <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> manner to ſhew what a traine of heauenly companions do attend vpon this faith, and certaintie of Gods eternall fauour, and to leaue the meditation of and vpon it, to the reuerent and deuout reader: Another therefore is heartie and vnfained loue, in him (<hi>who feeleth this loue of God ſhed into his heart</hi>) retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him againe. The which although in hollownes and hypocriſie, the moſt affirme boldly to be in them towards God, before they haue found and felt themſelues to be beloued of him; yet the Scripture teacheth vs that it is farre otherwiſe,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.19. Ioh. 15.16.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeeing we haue not loued him, but he hath loued vs firſt.</hi> But when we ſee indeed what great things God hath done for vs, from what dreadfull bondage he hath deliuered vs, vnto the which in all our life we were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and to what gracious liberties and priuiledges he hath reſtored vs, by forgiuing vs all our ſinnes; then we ſee iuſt cauſe to ſay with the Prophet: <hi>I loue the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.1 Luk. 7.47.</note>

               <p>Which I ſay for two cauſes: The one, becauſe in ſome reſpects it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yea holie, <hi>to deſire to liue</hi>; namely, to doe good in the Church:<note place="margin">Phil. 1.20.21.</note> and wee may and ought to ſay with <hi>Dauid, I will liue and not die, to ſet foorth the praiſe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Lord.</hi> The ſame I ſay of dealing in our earthly affaires,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.17.</note> to the end we may not be burdenſome to others, and of performing the duties of our particular callings: in the which actions, we may haue proofe of the grace that is in vs; I meane patience, righteouſnes, hope, faith, loue; that ſo our whole conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation may bee well ordred, and proportionable to other holie duties: and therefore in theſe reſpects we may be willing and content to liue, while God will haue it ſo, <hi>that wee may ſhew foorth the vertues,</hi> which he hath giuen vs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men: which otherwiſe ſhould be hidden, and it could not otherwiſe be ſeene of men, that any can poſſibly liue godly, who hath an hand in the world; when in the meane while God forbiddeth not the actions mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but commaunds them: only he chargeth, that in doing of them,<note place="margin">Luk. 21.34.</note> we be not tainted, neither haue our conſciences defiled.</p>
               <p>The 2. cauſe, why I ſay, that we ſhould not contemne life, and other lawful liberties, is, becauſe vpon this principle falſely grounded, and as falſly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (that wee ſhould forſake the world) diuers haue troubled many weake people &amp; abuſed them; ſaying and teaching (and that vnder a great pretence of godlines) that when we begin to be deuout, and to ſauour of religion, wee ought to leaue the world: that is to ſay, depart from our earthly callings, and dealings, and alſo from the ſocietie and fellowſhip of men who are occupied therein.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we are (ſay they) to goe aſide into Abbeyes, Frieries, Armetages, and Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, where we may neither heare nor ſee any ſuch dealings.

               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:16851:45"/>For though many haue of a good meaning at the firſt, gone apart from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſecular affaires; and betaken themſelues to liue in ſequeſtred places, becauſe they would not be troubled with earthly dealings: yet ſubtile theeues aroſe afterwards, of the popiſh prelacie, who abuſed this to horrible miſchiefes: for we muſt not be ignorant of this, that when men will venture without their warrant, the longer they doe it, the further they fall into the depth of ſinne; as a man once gone out of his way, goeth further aſtray, till he ſeeke to come in againe. Which hath been the cauſe, why much wickednes hath in time broke forth in the Papacy (where the people haue been hartned to this monaſticall life, and ſuperſtitious deuotion) as idlenes, whoredome, ſodomitry, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and moſt cruell murthering of the ſoules of many infants which were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> misbegotten.

Thus therefore let Gods children keepe themſelues from feare and doubting, when they are in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> daunger of both, by an oft and ſerious weighing, how gracious and good the Lord is vnto them, that it may comfort them euen at the heart.

               <p>Whiles I thought verely (ſaid he) that I had faith,<note place="margin">A pithie ſpeech of a vvorthie perſon.</note> but yet held it not by the ſureſt grounds, I thought of it ſometimes, and was glad to thinke that I had it: holding my perſwaſion thereof, by ſuch euidences as I had before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed, rather then I could tell what ſure warrant I had then of it: but I tooke no great paine to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme it by daily meditating on the promiſes, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed any more diligence in and about that, then vppon other duties. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when I ſaw more cleerely how gainfull and beautifull a grace it is, and how I muſt liue by it, hauing no leſſe neede of it, then of the ayre to breathe in: I ſought more certaine ground of it, and that with greater care then I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and ſince I knew that I had it by more, and thoſe infallible arguments and teſtimonies, I could neuer be wearie of looking to and increaſing it (as I had learned how) but for ſome yeeres ſpace haue done, and do euery day nouriſh and ſtrengthen it, and I recreate my ſelfe in thinking what benefit I haue by it, vntill my gaine thereby, and pleaſure therein, doe keepe me there with delight, more then in all paſtime; and the labour which I beſtow about it, is ſo farre from toyle or weariſomnes, that it is my greateſt ſolace: neither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> doe I thinke or feele my ſelfe to be armed to the well going through the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the day, before I haue prepared my ſelfe thereto,<note place="margin">Pſal. 9.14.</note> by refreſhing my ſoule, with conſidering Gods aboundant loue and fauour towards me, and reſt vppon it as mine owne. But when I haue done it, I am (by good heede taking) cheerefull, and in good eſtate, all the day after: and ſo I am (in reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be it ſpoken) ſaid he, perſwaded, that I ſhall continue to doe.</p>
               <p>Now to make vſe of this Chriſtian ſpeech, becauſe it is according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and I haue ſaid nothing of him, which is not as needfull for vs; and his practiſe agreeth with the doctrine of the Scriptures: if wee will ſpeake euery man the truth, what comfort, or well ordered eſtate can be in our liues any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> day without it? And when that true and liuely beholding of Gods gracious kindnes is not preſent with vs to begin the day, what going forward in it, is to be looked for? but in vnſauourie lightnes, and ſo be deceiued:<note place="margin">The chiefeſt thing euery morning is to remember Gods loue.</note> or in care and ſorrow, and ſo bee diſquieted? Therefore if men were wiſe, they would ſee that they could not well want this any day; eſpecially ſeeing God hath giuen libertie to them to inioy ſuch ſweet communion with him by meanes <hi>of this pretious faith:</hi> but they would conſider their end, how vncertaine it is, as all other things which they inioy, and therfore be readie for it, at one time as well as another, which they might doe, if they <hi>held faſt their confidence, that bringeth with it ſo great reward.</hi> And how ſhall wee leade our whole life by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> faith, in our particular parts thereof, beleeuing that God will guide and bleſſe vs, as we ſhall heare in the next Treatiſe, if wee be not firſt well ſeaſoned and acquainted with this iuſtifying faith?</p>
               <p>But, alas, we verifie the ſaying of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Gods children not ſo wiſe for their good, as the bad for theirs.</note> though to our great ſhame it may bee ſpoken: <hi>that the children of this world are wiſer in their kinde then we:</hi> who if they bee diſappointed of their deſire one way, haue twentie ſhifts to ſeeke it another. But it is too manifeſt, that the moſt part, euen of the better

ſort, and thoſe who haue taſted of this faith and aſſurance alreadie, doe not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thinke this poſſible to keepe, yea and increaſe it from day to day: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore go not about it, but are content to hold it by ſtarts, now and then, when it is reuiued in them by ſome ſpeciall helpe of preaching.<note place="margin">Many good Chriſtians haue not halfe the comfort they might haue. <hi>Epheſ. 5.18.

                  </note> And thus doing, they ſee not the twentith part of Gods bountie and fatherly affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, who giueth them not ſome taſte now and then of his abundant loue, but would haue them <hi>filled with it,</hi> and that continually; yea and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be in ſafetie all the day long: which if many of Gods ſeruants did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, as they doe any article of their faith, that it is true; how greatly ſhould their heauie hearts bee made ioyfull, and <hi>their heads lifted vp</hi> with cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, whereas now deceiueable mirth, or vnprofitable ſorrow holdeth them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> downe, either at their labour, or from it, ſeeing they haue not this boldnes to <hi>reioyce in the Lord alwaies,</hi> and that becauſe they beleeue not alwaies, neither thinke that they may, or can poſſibly attaine to it.</p>
               <p>And by this meanes, that they are ſo ofte caſt from their hold, of faith, and ſo of peace, and conſtancie therein, the diuell weakneth and holdeth backe ſundrie (which are comming on) by their example: thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues well in the caſe they are in, rather then in following them, except they ſaw ſome beautie and excellencie in their liues, more then is in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Vnſetling of our ſelues from nouriſhing faith, is full of dangers.</note>Beſides this, they not holding their perſwaſion for continuance, as well as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> for ſome ſpeciall time, doe bring much vnprofitablenes into their liues, and ſometimes daungerous outſtrayings, and giue many offences, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould not: by al which, their heauines is increaſed, and ſomtimes long lien in. And that which is hardeſt of all the reſt, they either dare not riſe vp againe out of their ſorrow, or know not how they ſhould: and ſo they make the moſt part of their life to bee very bondage, which through belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhould be moſt ſweet libertie: &amp; thereby inioy not many comfortable fruits of faith in their liues, which other Chriſtians doe. And whiles all this commeth to paſſe, we muſt needs ſay, that God is not honoured of them, nor his praiſes ſo in their hearts, as they ſhould, and might be; if they from time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to time did nouriſh and liue by this their faith and confidence. But though I would haue it receiued, that much ſweetnes accompanieth this faith, yet I meane not here to ſet downe the priuiledges, which accompany it and a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life; that is done in another place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This ſpirit of bondage</hi> therefore, which holdeth them oft in feare, I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh were abandoned: and that this wauering and needles doubting, which poſſeſſeth ſo great part of their life (eſpecially when any great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction arreſteth them, or lieth long vpon them) were as farre from them, as <hi>the Eaſt is from the Weſt:</hi> ſo that they might ſee the aboundant fauour of God farre greater towards them, then euer they did: and that by how much they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> may inioy it more vſually, then euer they thought it poſſible. And as for them that count their aduice and direction for the preſeruing of faith, they ſhall goe without the fruite of it; till they ſee that they loſt not their labour, who were thought to doe too much, ſeeing they did more then themſelues could be perſwaded to doe. Therfore (as I haue ſaid) let all ſuch, as to whom God hath ſealed vp their ſaluation by his ſpirit, by the which <hi>he hath giuen

And let them be throughly perſwaded, that how croſſely ſoeuer things come to paſſe, yet the Lord ſeeketh their good by them, and doth not delight in their ſorrow and troubles: for if hee did, he could a thouſand waies make a rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them, but ſendeth them ſpecially for their benefit and good; ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſhall they <hi>grow rooted, and eſtabliſhed in their faith,</hi> as the graine of Muſtard ſeede, which after rooting becommeth a ſtalke,<note place="margin">The longer we liue, the better we ſhould be.</note> and hath branches and boughes: and as that groweth, ſo ſhall ſound peace and ſafetie, and ſtrength againſt their corruptions; yea and theſe meanes whereby it is preſerued, how weariſome ſoeuer they haue been ſometime, ſhall become eaſie and pleaſant, and from time to time more and more, ſo that they may be aſſured that they haue cauſe <hi>in all things to be thankfull.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Many haue found ſmall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort through their life.</note> And that ſhould be thought a rare and ſpeciall benefit, if wee conſider how many thouſands haue not an houre of this comfort through the yeere, no not through their whole life.

And by that which hath been ſaid in this treatiſe, it may bee gathered: that although this faith bee in ſubſtance one, and the ſame: yet that there are three degrees of it.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.1.</note> The firſt is the weakeſt and leaſt meaſure: when there is yet no aſſurance in the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; and yet inſeparable fruits, and infallible tokens of it: as I haue ſet down. The ſecond degree is, when ſome aſſurance is wrought in the beleeuer at ſome time, but very weake: and is often to ſeeke and wanting, and recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe by entring into due conſideration of his eſtate, and of the truth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of God, who hath promiſed it. The third is the higheſt degree of it, though more ſtrong and better ſetled in ſome then in other: and this hath aſſurance accompanying it for the moſt part vſually, vnleſſe the beleeuer doe quench the ſpirit in himſelfe; or the Lord (to ſhew him that he ſtandeth by grace) do leaue him to himſelfe, for his owne glorie, and the better eſtabliſhing of him afterwards.</p>
               <p>This I haue ſaid for their cauſe, who being tender and weake in faith, would deſire ſome helpe herein: the larger handling of the helpes is to bee ſought in the third part of this treatiſe, where the helps to preſerue the whole heart, and conſequently faith, and all godlines in the beleeuer, is ſet downe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Now I thinke it conuenient to leade forward this beleeuer to ſet this faith of his a worke by a godly life, and teach him what manner of courſe and eſtate that is: which is the ſecond treatiſe of this booke.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This (I ſay) is the argument and matter to be handled in this treatiſe. And ſeeing there is much difficultie about this point, as about the other, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer treatiſe; and ſeeing it is of greateſt weight and moment of all other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that:<note place="margin">Diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. <hi>Matth. 27.3.</hi>
                  </note> it muſt with like care be looked into and laid forth. For ſome thinke, that repentance and godlines, is nothing elſe, but griefe for ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed: and ſo <hi>Iudas</hi> might haue been godly. Some thinke, that to amend ſome thing which was amiſſe, is godlines, eſpecially, if they alſo doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſome good therewith; and ſo <hi>Herod</hi> that cauſed <hi>Iohn</hi> to be beheaded, might haue been godly:<note place="margin">Mark. 6.20.</note> 
                  <hi>For he reuerenced Iohn, and when he heard him, he did many things.</hi> Some thinke, that if they haue been well moued at the hearing of the word of God, and doe bowe themſelues before God, for the time, in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes of repentance only; that then they be godly in deede: but ſo might <hi>Ahab</hi> haue been godly. Some, if they can ſhut vp all their vaine talke,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16851:50"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> bad dealings, fooliſh ieſtings, with ſuch other merriments at their meetings, in this manner [Lord haue mercie vpon vs, we are all ſinners] that then they haue repented: and ſo the common ſort of wicked ones, may be ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and to be godly. And laſtly, popiſh contrition, auricular confeſſion, and ſatisfaction, is thought in poperie to be good repentance: which (as they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them) are as farre from it as any of the former. Theſe are ſome few, of a great many opinions about this matter; all which are moſt dangerous and erronious: It is therefore very neceſſarie,<note place="margin">Jt is neceſſarie to vnderstand wherein a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</note> that we may vnderſtand the will of God aright concerning this, and what to leane vnto, that we be not deceiued.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> My purpoſe is therefore in this treatiſe, to ſet downe at large what a godly life is, and wherein it conſiſteth, that he who deſireth it, may ſee,<note place="margin">The neceſſarie connexion of this treatiſe with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note> whether his courſe and behauiour be ſuch or no: and the triall of this muſt be made of him, who hath tried himſelfe by the former, that the one may be ſeene to goe with the other, and both together as twinnes; ſo that he who hath not both, may be truely ſaid to haue neither. And in laying forth this matter, I will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this method and order: to referre all that ſhall be ſpoken about it,<note place="margin">Faith and a godly life, are as twinnes, and goe together. The heads of this treatiſe are foure.</note> to foure generall heads or parts. The firſt, that a godly life muſt of neceſſitie goe with the faith before ſpoken of: and that it is the foundation and ground thereof, whereby we receiue and giue credit, not only to the promiſe of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſaluation; but alſo to all other promiſes of temporarie benefits appertaining to this life, and alſo to the whole word of God, with a mind to relie vpon it, and to be guided by it. This is the firſt head of this treatiſe. The ſecond, that there muſt be a pure heart in him who muſt lead a godly life: a pure heart, I ſay, renued and changed from that it was before, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.26.</note> 
                  <hi>I will take away your ſtonie or hard heart from you, and put a new heart in you:</hi> This muſt of neceſſitie be in him who ſhall liue godly, and ſo conſequently, that the whole man be changed. Thirdly, I will ſet downe the firſt part of a godly life; and ſhew that it is a renouncing and forſaking of all ſinne, both inward and outward. And fourthly, I will adde the other part of godlines, declaring that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it conſiſteth in a full purpoſe of the heart, and a true indeuour of life, to obey God in all things, euen vnto the end. By which alſo may be gathered a ſhort deſcription of this life of the beleeuer; that it is ſuch a conuerſation, as being grounded on faith in a ſanctified perſon, renounceth all euill, and practiſeth good duties, though weakely, yet conſtantlie afterward. And to theſe foure ſhall be annexed reaſons to perſwade to a more cheerefull practiſing of this godly life (ſeeing the beſt need ſpurres) and the anſwering of obiections, which might with-hold and hinder from it. All which conſidered, it ſhall not be hard for him that will learne, to vnderſtand plainely and cleerely, what the life of the beleeuer is, and withall, whether he which profeſſeth himſelfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to haue true faith, be alſo in his life and conuerſation reformed, and how he may be ſo. So that although there be many meaſures of grace, and ſome are in many degrees before other in this eſtate and condition of liuing godly: yet euery one in whom theſe things ſhall be found, may proue himſelfe god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, howſoeuer he wanteth ſomewhat, which many others haue. And of the ſumme and order of this treatiſe in generall, thus much be ſaid.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus, hauing ſhewed what the ſumme of this treatiſe is, and the order and parts of it, I will now proceede: and firſt, ſeeing I haue taken in hand to deſcribe the life of the beleeuer, and what the godly life is, which he muſt leade:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> I will indeuour my ſelfe to helpe and direct him herein; as God hath inabled me, that as in the former treatiſe he may proue and ſee himſelfe to haue faith to be ſaued, ſo he may learne by this, to ioyne with his faith, godlines.</p>
               <p>But before I lay forth this godly life at large, in this chapter, I will begin with the firſt point of the firſt generall part of this treatiſe, that is, that ſeeing godlines cannot be without iuſtifying faith, but ſpringeth and ariſeth from it, as the branch from the tree;<note place="margin">Iames 2.18.</note> for ſo Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes:</hi> therefore where no true iuſtifying faith is, there can be no godly life. And ſo he,<note place="margin">Where true faith is not, there is no good life. <hi>Epheſ. 2.3.</hi>
                  </note> who is no true beleeuer, cannot haue any ſparkle of godlines in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> him; but is vtterlie deſtitute, and voide thereof, euen altogether vngodly, as the Apoſtle writeth: <hi>We all had our conuerſation ſometime as other diſobedient men, in the lustes of our fleſh, doing thoſe things which liked vs:</hi> where we ſee, that this was the life of all, euen the beſt, <hi>to be ſtrangers to the life of godlines, and the children of wrath, before they beleeued,</hi> Epheſ. 2.8. But leaſt any through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance might ſay: though we did that which liked the luſts of our hearts, yet we did not onely ſo, nor all that we did, was not ſuch, but ſome good we did amongſt the euill which we committed, (and if it be ſo, they thinke that the one may anſwere for the other:) I further ſay to them, out of the place to Titus 1.15. <hi>Vnto the pure, are all things pure: but vnto them that are defiled and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> is nothing pure; but euen their minds and conſciences are defiled:</hi> to the Hebrues,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> that <hi>without faith, it is impoſsible to pleaſe God,</hi> whatſoeuer things we doe, but all is abhominable, odious, and vile before him. For as is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ſo are the riuers which runne from it; and as is the heart, and the cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of it, ſo are the actions which proceede from it: <hi>but the cogitations of the heart are alwaies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6.5. <hi>No good thing in the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God.</hi> Gen. 9.6. Prou. 28.9. Pſalm. 50.16. Gen. 4.4.</note> 
                  <hi>and onely euill.</hi> So that (to returne) in the vnbeleeuer there is no good thing that pleaſeth God: his beſt actions are turned into ſinne: his praiers, almes, reading, hearing, confeſſions, thankeſ-giuings, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer elſe, they are all abominable in him; and God will neuer be pleaſed with his workes and ſeruices, vntill the perſon, namely, euen he himſelfe be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of him; and that is not till he beleeue: as it is in the epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues 10.38. <hi>The iust ſhall liue by faith, but if any withdraw himſelfe</hi> [that is, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough vnbeliefe] <hi>my ſoule ſhall haue no pleaſure in him, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the worke which God requireth of him, aboue, and beyond all workes, that he beleeue in his ſonne, that he hath alreadie wrought his happines: and therefore that he ſhall be ſaued by him onely. Now if a man,

I haue ſaid it oft, and now ſay it with griefe, that all theſe, who haue ſuch things raigning in them, are not onely their owne enemies, but alſo to our preaching of the Goſpell of Chriſt: neither is <hi>their reioycing good,</hi> who glorie in their faith and hope, when yet they are thus earthly and carnally minded.</p>
               <p>They muſt know it (howſoeuer they beleeue) that God hath ioyned with <hi>faith, vertue,</hi> and <hi>godlines, patience, temperance</hi>; and that who ſo beleeueth, is thereby turned from his old conuerſation. For mine owne part,<note place="margin">Too haſtie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſound.</note> I haue long miſliked this haſte, and ſudden ſhewes of great repentance in men, who in their firſt acquaintance with the word preached to them, haue not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that they haue repented (when beſides ſome gripes of grief, they haue not knowne what repentance meaneth) but they haue thought themſelues able almoſt on the ſudden to cenſure, yea to condemne other, and teach them; and ſo although with boldnes enough ioyned with as much igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, they haue taken in hand to doe. I ſpeake not of ſuch as are humbled in their hearts for their ſinne, who deſire nothing more then to be ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from the feare which oppreſſeth them, learning daily to beleeue, and to be grounded therein; who dare no otherwiſe beleeue their ſinnes forgiuen them, then they walke humbly before God and men: but of ſuch as paſſe from ſorrow for ſin without faith, to newnes of life, as they imagine,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> was neuer, nor euer ſhall be attained; leauing the learning of faith,<note place="margin">Change of life without faith, vaine.</note> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods fauour, which is the beginning, and worker of all new life, as a thing ſoone gotten: and therefore it is ſo ſleightly laboured for of them, and ſo to ſeeke with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for want of thorough prouing whether they haue it or no, that many are driuen againe to ſeeke for it, many yeeres after, they thought they had been ſure of it, yea and (that which is more to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) many of them neuer attaine vnto it at all.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16851:53"/>
that young beginners in learning of any trade, ſhould by and by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> occupiers,<note place="margin">A ſimile.</note> and ſetters vp; or that they ſhould rule well, who haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer learned to obey: ſo it ſtandeth not with religion, that they ſhould count themſelues good Chriſtians, or that they ſhould be ſo indeede, who haue not taſted of Chriſt, and the benefit thereof; <hi>neither learned him, as the truth is in him,</hi> that is, <hi>to put off the old man with his affections and lusts, and to put on the new:</hi> and who haue not felt him ſo good and bountifull to them, that for his ſake they be readie to doe any thing.</p>
               <p>This I haue ſpoken by occaſion of the matter in hand; namely, that faith bringeth alwaies with it new life; in ſo much, that when it is ouermatched with the fleſhly corruption, yet it raiſeth ſighings and ſtriuings in the heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> till it be ſubdued, that I might at leaſt preuaile with ſome of my brethren, that they pleaſe not themſelues in thinking they haue faith, when their liues are filled,<note place="margin">It is vaine to thinke we haue faith without a new life.</note> not only with many offenſiue actions; but alſo with cuſtome and commons in the ſame: whereas he which is honored with the title of Gods ſeruant, muſt be known by the liuerie of vncorrupt life, and proue by his ſauour and ſmell of good conuerſation, that he came from God, and is not of the earth,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.4.</note> that ſo he may ſhew himſelfe to be a man of God indeed: his rootes muſt be faſtened as the trees of Lebanon:<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.6.</note> he muſt flouriſh as the Lillie, and finde the graces of God as dew to quicken them. For of this be we ſure, that whatſoeuer men alleage, why their liues cannot beare the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> mould and print of ſound doctrine,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.17.</note> and yet they will needes goe for the approoued ſeruants of God; it is a ſtrong deluſion which perſwadeth them ſo.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing the Scripture doth (as I haue ſaid) ſo fully, and ſo often ſet downe this truth vnto vs, that ſuch as haue obtained mercy of God, are taught and guided by him: ought not men to ſettle themſelues to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe, then in times paſt they walked in, being now deliuered from ſo great bondage?<note place="margin">Luk. 1.75.</note> For to that end, as they haue heard, they were deliuered.

               <p>But though all, who haue hope to be ſaued, ſhould doe this;<note place="margin">The beleeuers doe not thus. <hi>1. Cor. 3.1.</hi>
                  </note> yet it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, they doe not.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">VVant of this faith worketh much inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience.</note>And therefore when they haue ſome work of true faith in them; yet they ſee not how to ſet vpon repentance, and a godly life: how to begin, and how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to proceede therein, but are off, and on, now forward, then backward, and ſcarcely at any time ſetled and ſtaied: the which although it be ſo, in great part through their owne weaknes, yet is it alſo in reſpect of their ignorance: I ſpeake of the better ſort of people, and ſuch as <hi>haue receiued the firſt fruites of the ſpirit.</hi> Whereas, if they were perſwaded that they ought to make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all ſound doctrine that they heare, and to giue aſſent to euery part of the word of God, and ſubmit themſelues thereto, promiſes, threats and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; they ſhould hold more firmely the perſwaſion of their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo be better prepared how to flie euill, and how to doe dutie, and how to truſt God in all kindes of his promiſes.

                  <note place="margin">The teſtimonie of good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note>And for the benefit of many good ſoules, I will ſay that which hath been acknowledged vnto me, by ſundrie well approued chriſtians, when I haue in conference ſet downe plainelie to them the point which now I write of:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16851:55"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> namely, how neceſſarie it is to beleeue in generall, whatſoeuer other promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or precepts in the word of God, as well as the promiſes of ſaluation by Chriſt. Oh, haue many ſaid, if wee could haue holpe vp our ſelues, out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, feare, and vncomfortable dumpes, by applying the promiſes of God concerning grace neceſſarie for vs, outward deliuerance from daungers, and good ſucceſſe in our lawfull dealings of this life; wee might with much eaſe and peace haue ſtaied vp our ſelues, when for want therof, we were ſore plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and almoſt fainted: and with halfe the toyle which wee vſed for it, wee might haue vpholden our ſelues in hope &amp; with comfort. For many houres, yea and ſometime daies, wee haue beate our braines and reaſoned to and fro <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> with heauie hearts, how to wade thorough ſome afflictions, and how to bee contented with ſome accidents which were like to fal out and come to paſſe: and this we did, becauſe we miſſed of the right way of truſting to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, that he would turne all to the beſt: without which reſolution, who can quietly reſt in any vncertainties here below? So effectuall and good a meane it is, to be led by faith, and to haue it as a daily companion with vs. By which wee hauing perſwaſion of the greateſt benefit of all other, namely Chriſt: we might the more eaſily haue aſſured our ſelues (we ſee now) of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſmaller, whether any trouble, to haue a good iſſue out of it; or any good thing (as it ſhould haue been expedient for vs) to inioy it. And wee may ſay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> truly, wee know nothing to haue been the cauſe of ſo much and ſo long vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitablenes and heauines theſe many yeeres, as this: that we haue not been rooted and grounded in faith, as we haue had a care to pleaſe God. For wee being ſubtilly vndermined by Sathan to hold in this errour of vnbeleefe (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee ſee manifeſtly that the ſeede of faith was in vs) it was the cauſe why in all other good things we went forward the more ſleightly. So that we ſee great cauſe to ſeaſon our hearts with beleeuing throughout our whole life, whatſoeuer labour it coſt vs. To this purpoſe was the ſpeech of thoſe Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And to goe forward, who doth not know, that when ſome certaintie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſaluation is attained of men, yet for all that, in as much as it is but weake, that they haue many heart griefes for this, that they ſee they haue a long weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome pilgrimage to goe thorough; and little knowledge and perſwaſion of any great guiding of them through all the feares and difficulties of it?<note place="margin">An exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</note> Pitie therefore the diſtreſſed eſtate of Gods poore people, ye ſhepheards of his flocke. Although this is but one point of many which ye are to teach them: and arme your ſelues with that minde, which was in the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.12.</note> who <hi>ſaw it meete as long as he ſhould abide in this tabernacle, to put the people in mind of al things neceſſarie to ſaluation from day to day, though they knew and were ſtabliſhed in them.</hi> And let me with your patience, ſay one thing more to you, which if ye will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be aduiſed by me, will be much to your owne benefit, and of thoſe that heare you. Aboue all things, ſeeke to haue that your owne and effectually wrought in your ſelues, which you teach the people (for you know that the Phiſitions who practiſe by experience, are beſt able to deale with their patients). Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this matter of faith, labour to be more exerciſed: how you haue vſe of it, in beleeuing for your owne parts, either precepts or promiſes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not your ſelues with bare knowledge of the truth. And ſo doing, ye ſhall
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16851:56"/>
make good gaine of that which you ſhall teach, if your hearers ſhould not:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and yet ſuch teaching, while ye bee ſure that it hath done your ſelues much good, ſhall ſet ſuch an edge on your doctrine by your more liuely, cheereful, and powerfull deliuering of it, that it ſhall farre more eaſily procure an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite in the people to receiue it, as they did in <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi> time with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> and as it were <hi>with violence</hi>; and ſo, that if they be not brought to the true practiſe of Chriſtianitie by it, they will not bee brought to it by any other teaching.</p>
               <p>And this I wiſh, that ye be not of the minde that ſome haue been of (for it is no opinion fit for the Miniſter of God) that is to ſay, that they thinke, though ſome preach by experience, yet no man is bound to do ſo: as though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> it were in mens choice to doe which they liſt; when wee know, that <hi>the good ſhepheard doth go before the ſheepe,</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Let faith and godlines be oft taught.</note>Now I haue ſaid what I purpoſed, I will goe forward. In teaching, labour much in this manner, which I haue mentioned, to beate into the people, (with making it plaine to them, how they may be aſſured of their ſaluation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> as I haue taught in the firſt treatiſe) beate in (I ſay) this doctrine of beleeuing, that God will miniſter all helpe to inable them to liue godly. For in both points (if view might be taken throughout this dominion) it ſhould be found that the people are ignorant and to ſeeke; both how to come to the aſſurance of ſaluation, and alſo how they ſhould be rightly taught to leade a godlie and a Chriſtian life. And how commeth this to paſſe, but becauſe men teach not oft (of which all may ſee what neede there is) or els they doe not in commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration of the peoples weak capacitie and memorie, beate vpon theſe things among all other againe and againe.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.1.</note> So S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath left behind him his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe for our inſtruction, ſaying: <hi>It grieueth me not to write</hi> (when hee cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> come to preach them) <hi>the ſame things to you, and for you, it is a ſure thing.</hi> And we ſhould know, that it is no ſhame to preach the ſame things oft, yea in our owne congregation; but meete and fit (eſpecially if they bee theſe ſpeciall matters) vnleſſe we contend for the vaine praiſe of men, and will ſhew our pride by ſeeking after nouelty,<note place="margin">The ſame things without vaine repetition and barbarouſnes.</note> rather then our deſire of the peoples edifying. Yet I nouriſh not barbarouſnes, nor the vttering vnſeaſonably and vnſauour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either of the ſame words and ſentences, or in boſome Sermons, the ſame things: but in <hi>the euidence of the ſpirit,</hi> and in renuing our labour and paine, euen about the ſame doctrine which we taught before, it ſhalbe ſo farre from being weariſome and tedious, that the beſt hearers ſhall affirme that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> cannot heare them too oft, but deſire with all their hearts to heare them againe.<note place="margin">Act. 13.42.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe I am by fit occaſion come to vtter this, I will adde one thing which ought worthily to preuaile much both with Preacher &amp; people. And that is this: that in this long and gracious time of peace and libertie, of free preaching the Goſpell, he is a rare priuate man (that I goe no further) who is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16851:56"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> able, plainly and ſoundly to ſet downe, how a ſinner may know himſelfe to be in the ſtate of ſaluation, and aſſured that he is the child of God; and when he is ſo, how hee ſhould bring foorth the fruites of repentance, and leade a godly and Chriſtian life. I know it is the holie Ghoſt, who alone can worke this in mens hearts, but I ſpeake of the expreſſing and ſetting down theſame. And though I doubt not but that ſome conceiue it, yet if they did that well, they could in ſome ſort vtter it alſo: as wee are commaunded <hi>to take vnto vs words to expreſſe that which we conceiue</hi>; as well as to haue matter in our minds.<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.2.</note> And although the knowledge of this in generall, doe bring men in liking with it: yet who ſeeth not, that the particular vnfolding hereof, by fit cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> knitting one point with another, is the way to make it vnderſtood and conceiued aright? By the which the hearer is farre more eaſily brought to haue the effectuall worke thereof in him.</p>
               <p>And thus to returne againe to that from whence I digreſſed not vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, and ſo to draw to an end about it: Although people profit thus far that they get ſome true taſte of ſaluation by preaching; yet they ſhall very much ſtagger and goe backe, and coldly ſet vpon the practiſe of godlines, if they be not well grounded in beleeuing, that God will build them vp more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from day to day, and <hi>perfect the good worke in them which he hath begun, euen to full ſanctification in the feare of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A ſimile.</note> If a chiefe and maine poſt in a building <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> be wanting, will not the whole houſe bee ſoone ſhaken? ſo if a Chriſtian, who muſt reforme his life, goe about it, not beleeuing that God will make him able; he may be ſure he ſhal want a maine helpe hereto, euen that which will goe nigh to pull downe all that is ſet vp. For if he haue not faith, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that God will ſtrengthen him; what ſtrength hath hee but his owne? which is as fit for ſuch a worke to bring it to paſſe, as a child is to build a great Caſtle by his skill. But if he be well ſetled in this confidence (his heart alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purified and chaunged; which (as we ſhall heare afterwards) is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required; he ſhall goe about it with cheerefulnes and readines; he ſhall be incouraged to pray as his neceſſities ſhall giue cauſe; hee ſhall be kept from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> fainting and diſmaiednes, when his ſtrength is not very great, and riſe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine when he is fallen: all which ſhall be great meanes in ſuch a caſe to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, and ſet him forward to depend vpon God, without any great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetling of him (and yet ſhall he not for all this, be without ſenſe and feeling of his infirmities:) which another as willing to obey God as he, ſhall neuer be able to doe; but euery while caſt downe and diſmaied, vntill hee get the ſame furniture. And this muſt here be marked, that there ſhall be the better proceeding herein, of euery weake Chriſtian, as his knowledge ſhall be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the word of God: which before grace came (as fire to the ſtubble to kindle and ſet it a worke to burne) although it were idle and vnprofitable in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> him, and lay voide, and vnoccupied, as timber lieth by, till the building goe forward: yet it ſhall then helpe much to the leauing of euill, and the doing of good, eſpecially after experience in time, ſhall be ioyned to both. And when all theſe meete together in an vpright hearted Chriſtian, how weake ſoeuer, if he acquaint himſelfe familiarly with the promiſes of eternall life, and treaſure vp in a good conſcience the certaintie of the forgiuenes of ſins from day to day: then this is he who hath laid a ſtrong foundation of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

life, vpon which it ſhall be no hard matter to ſet the building of his life ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and proportionable afterwards:<note place="margin">Matth. 7.25.</note> ſo that, although <hi>the raine fall, and the flouds come, and the winde blow, and beate vpon that houſe, yet it ſhall not fall; for it is builded on a rocke.</hi> But he who laieth not this foundation, but buildeth on the ſand, ſhall ſoone his building turned ouer. And thus the caſe ſtandeth with many in theſe daies, who therefore are caſt downe oft times from their good beginnings, becauſe they had not skill to make them more ſubſtantiall and ſure. And I feare not to affirme (the Lord witneſſing to that which I ſay) that the offenſiue liues of many, with many ſtartings aſide from the good way which they haue entred into, and the crooked and halting ſteppes that they make groſſely in the ſight of men, who yet durſt not ſomtime before quench <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the ſpirit in themſelues, not hurt their tender conſciences ſecretly in the ſight of God: theſe (I ſay) are chiefly from hence, that they laid not the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aright, nor made not their firſt entrance into a Chriſtian life, ſound and ſure. Among other things, they haue failed for the moſt part in this, of which I doe moſt ſpecially ſpeake in this place, that they haue not been builded vp in this faith and perſwaſion, that God will further their weake beginnings, and fortifie their hearts againſt the ſtumbling blockes and diſcouragements, which ſhall ſtand vp in their way.

The time would be too ſhort to proceed further, and I ſhall haue occaſion, in another place, to ſpeake of the ſame. But by the way, this is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie to be lamented, that where the Scripture is ſo plentifull in deſcribing and ſetting out of the manifold and foule defilements of the heart, that men are ſo blind in vnderſtanding them; and ſee ſo little, when the holy Ghoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraieth ſo much. And hereof it is, that they feare ſo little danger, and ſuſpect ſo little hurt to be comming towards them thereby, in the middeſt of ſo great and iuſt cauſe to feare and ſuſpect both. For who is merrier or more ſecure, than he that hath moſt ſinne in his heart to witnes againſt him?

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">What the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of ſinne is.</note>But to go forward now, to ſhew what this purging of the heart is, and how
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16851:58"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it ſhould be purged. For the firſt, we muſt know, that it is a renuing in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and righteouſnes by little and little, of all true beleeuers, they being firſt deliuered and freed from the tyranie of ſinne, and feare of damnation: for a man is no ſooner ſet at libertie from the feare of euerlaſting death, and the wrath of God, but he is alſo ſenſiblie drawne to let goe his holde, and intereſt in ſinne, which before he had; and feeleth the ſame to receiue a deadly wound in him, and the power thereof to be abated and crucified: And ſo, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that verified in him which the Apoſtle ſetteth downe to the Romans; that is to ſay, <hi>How can ſuch as are dead to ſinne, liue any longer therein?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.2.</note> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, he is quickened and ſenſiblie ſtirred vp to a loue and earneſt deſire of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> things holy and heauenlie, euen that he may pleaſe God;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.23.</note> 
                  <hi>and being renued in the ſpirit of his minde,</hi> doth affect and long after righteouſneſſe and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And herein conſiſteth this purging and changing of the heart, which I now ſpeake of, and ſuch a thing it is, ſhewing it ſelfe by an hatred of ſinne, and a delighting in goodnes. Which no power nor will of man can effect: for it is an enemie thereto.</p>
               <p>And although this new change be not ſuch, as that it is able to beare down all the old corruption, that raigned in him ſometime, and to intertaine holy things only: yet it is a mightie alteration, that goodnes hath any place in him in truth, which was before ſo farre from him, and ſinne and euill hunted out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in will, and deſire, which alone bare ſway before.<note place="margin">He that dieth in this weake estate is ſaued.</note> For there is (without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) the firſt fruite of the ſpirit, which will afterwards bring forth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the ſame for continuance: which worke of grace and ſanctification (if he in whom it is wrought ſhould not liue to ſhew forth any further fruite of it) is an infallible marke of Gods election and loue towards him, and can no more be in a reprobate, then light can be in the bellie and bowels of the earth. But if any will demaunde, what becommeth of this grace in time;<note place="margin">Holy deſires be oft times quenched in the beleeuer.</note> becauſe it is too cleere, that it is not only dimmed, but euen choaked alſo in many, in whom it began to ſhine and giue light: ſuch muſt vnderſtand, that God doth ſtrengthen and continue this grace of holines and ſanctification, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as it is nouriſhed, eſteemed, and ſet by; and as men do ſtir it vp in themſelues by asking after it, when they miſſe it, and prouoke themſelues to pray for ſuch good affections, and cannot be ſatisfied without them. As <hi>Dauid</hi> did often, ſometime one way, and ſometime another: <hi>Why art thou heauie, O my ſoule,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 43.5.</note>

                  <hi>praiſe thou the Lord (O my ſoule) and all that is within thee, praiſe his holy name.</hi> And thus, and by the like means, we ſhall cheriſh our ſparkles, which (as the fire is blowne vp with bellowes) ſhall not ordinarilie faile vs, not be extinguiſhed in vs, eſpeciallie for any long time, (except in time of temptation, or when melancholy oppreſſeth vs) vnleſſe through our default and folly. Thus vnderſtand what it is,<note place="margin">How the heart is purged.</note> to haue the heart <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> purged and changed, that thereby it may be fit to ſet vpon a godlie life.</p>
               <p>The next thing is, how this is done; and how it commeth to paſſe, that men after they haue receiued the grace of iuſtifying faith, doe finde and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in themſelues ſuch an alteration from that which was before? euen as if a benumming colde ſhould be on the ſuddaine turned into a glowing and burning heate.

Which if that man of ſinne had duly conſidered, he would not haue arrogated to himſelfe a greater worke then it, (which alſo is inſeparable from it) namely, the authoritie of forgiuing ſinnes. The Lord (I ſay) by his holie ſpirit, it is, who ſtirreth vp in our hearts godlie motions and good deſires: namely, of knowledge, good gouernment, feare of him, communion with him and his people, the deſire of ſpirituall reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and ſtrength againſt infernall foes, and ſuch like: which good affections when they be kindled in vs, hee ſuffereth not to vaniſh away, but teacheth vs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to feed and nouriſh them by reading, meditation, &amp; prayer. And the ſpirit of the Lord which raiſeth vp and worketh in vs theſe holy affections, is therfore deſcribed by theſe moſt excellent titles: for it is called <hi>the ſpirit of wiſedome, ſtrength,</hi>

Which thing I ſpeake for their cauſe, who both thinke, and oft vtter the ſame, ſaying: Oh I am not, as ſuch of Gods children! they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> happie, for that they are not troubled with frowardnes, impatience, anger, wearines of good exerciſes, wandring in hearing of Sermons, reading and prayer, and ſuch other like carnal deſires, as I am: and yet the ſame perſons both haue had a true taſte of eternal life, and earneſt combates with their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: yea and while they complaine, they teſtifie their going forward in ſubduing their corruptions, farre otherwiſe then they who are not ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and doe declare plainly that they loue the grace which they mourne for, and hate deadly the corruption, which they complaine and crie out of.

And in this eſtate, we are very fitly compared to the graine of muſtard ſeede, after that it is ſhot vp, and hath a blade and ſtalke, till it come to haue boughes and branches to ſhelter the fowles of the ayre; ſo in this we are euer growing, though ſlowlie: and this degree of chriſtianitie, is betwixt olde age and infancie.

And this eſtate, though it be to be aimed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> at, of all godlie people; yet it is not obtained, but of ſuch as haue accuſtomed their mindes to the heauenlie courſe, and to whom good meditations and thoughts, to ſhunne and auoide euill, are become a pleaſure; and as well to be able to diſcerne the ſame by their vnderſtanding, and iudgement,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.14.</note> as to haue their will in good ſort at commaundement to follow the good, and ſhunne the euill.

Their religion muſt not be to eſpie faults in other (for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ſoone learned) and to hold a vaine and deceitfull hope of their own righteouſnes, when it is but froth: for that is readie enough to take holde on them, eſpecially where they are not vnder good teaching. Neither let them thinke much to heare a rebuke, which ſauoureth in them of much pride and blindnes; nor to thinke euery good thing rare and admirable in themſelues, when many euils are within them, which they doe not yet eſpie and finde out: but reuerence Gods graces in others, that they may the ſooner be like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> them.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue ſhewed in ſome ſort what are the thoughts, affections, and deſires vſually, and for the moſt part of the weaker ſort of Gods children (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout matters of the ſoule) this being added, that they are grieued, when they are led of the contrarie: and this is to bee vnderſtood of that part of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, which is free from ſtrong and vehement temptations: for otherwiſe, it may beſt be gathered out of the former treatiſe how it is with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; the which I haue partly laid foorth and deſcribed plainly, and partly ſet downe in the way of exhortation. For the ſame things that I exhort them vnto, are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie anatomie and repreſentation of their hearts, except the diuell hath caſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> them into ſome ſpirituall ſicknes, as I haue ſaid: which he doth to many of this weake ſort, as alſo he may doe, and doth where hee can enter, with both the other ſorts alſo.<note place="margin">Gods children are in danger ſometimes to be dazeled and without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> My meaning is, that the children of God weak or ſtrong, doe not onely ſtep aſide ſometimes from the peaceable eſtate, wherein they deſire to keepe: but alſo are in daunger (without continuall watchfulnes, and earneſt and oft praying) to be ſenſibly dazeled, as men not knowing where they are, and ſtript of grace vtterly to their owne feeling, as if there had neuer been any: Which I ſay, that none may be diſmaied (as they might eaſily be) if they ſhould heare onely the beſt of the ſtate of the godly, and not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſomething of the worſt alſo; and yet, euen that worſt part God turneth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to their good, as they in time by experience doe eaſily perceiue. But if any thinke that this laſt ſort of Gods children (which indeed is the weakeſt of the reſt) or either of the other, bee nothing differing from the vnregenerate in their thoughts and deſires: they muſt know, that the ſecreteſt hypocrite, which of all vnreformed ones commeth neereſt them, is yet farre differing from the weakeſt true Chriſtian: as both may bee ſeene by that which hath
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16851:75"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> been ſaid of both, and as the ſame hypocrite would confeſſe, if he might bee conuerted. And I will in few words ſhew as much as ſhall be expedient. For when a godly man diſlikes himſelfe moſt, yet euen then he is farre before the beſt of the other: who haue not their mindes occupied about heauenlie matters; the thought thereof is tedious vnto them: they deſire no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance therewith: neither delight they to thinke how they may be better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; neither can they bee brought to put themſelues <hi>in the weights of the Sanctuarie,</hi> that is, to trie their eſtate by the word of God: But their thoughts and deſires are about carnall libertie, pleaſure, profit, long life, reuenge, &amp;c. euen as their ſpeech is, that commeth from their hearts, frothie and vaine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> idle and vnſauourie, earthly and worldly. And when it is any better, it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by conſtraint of others, or to ſhew the pride of heart, or for vaine glorie, or to ſome ſuch end, or els they are ſoone wearie of it. So that, it may trulie be ſaid, that the deſires and thoughts of Gods people, euen the weakeſt, differ much from others, who are vnrenued. And this may in ſome ſort ſhew the vſuall thoughts and deſires of this third kinde of godly people, as of the two former. As for the diuers meaſures of ſpirituall growth in them, in degree one aboue another, as I haue followed the Scripture in the ſetting out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; ſo I thought good in a word to put the reader in minde of this,<note place="margin">Theſe degrees may in ſome reſpect fall one into another.</note> that euery action mentioned in the three kinds of our eſtate, muſt not preciſely be ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to that kind, in which it is reckoned, that it may not alſo pertaine to one of the other: but for the moſt part, the affections which are reckoned to euery one, are moſt proper to that, to the which they are referred. Neither is any to think that theſe cogitations, which I haue ſet downe to belong moſt properly to euery kind of age in Chriſt, are the only meditations &amp; thoughts of them; but that amongſt others (according to the diuers occaſions of euery one) they haue oftentimes theſe, and ſuch like occupying their hearts, but more oft deſiring, then inioying them: whereas others which are not parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the promiſe of life, haue ſeldome any good thoughts; or if they haue, they are fleeting and momentanie, and either cauſed by feare, or prouoked of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> others, and as I may ſay, violent, ſo that they abide not; and not voluntarie, ſeeing they haue not the ſpirit of Chriſt, which only doth worke them. And all this that I haue ſaid of the three ſorts of Gods people, may cleerely be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated and proued by the many examples out of the holy Scriptures, <hi>who of weake became ſtrong</hi>: As <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 3.11.</note> who was firſt afraid to looke <hi>Pharao</hi> in the face, deſiring that another might goe who was meeter then he:<note place="margin">Exod. 10.29.</note> yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hee was not afraide to doe his meſſage boldly and thoroughly in the name of the Lord. And <hi>Peter,</hi> who in his middle eſtate, as I may ſay, was ſo faint and fearfull, that hee was ſtriken and flighted with the voyce of a ſillie damſell, Luk. 22.57. yet after, when he grew to the degree of a father, was not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> abaſhed at the threat of the high Prieſt, Act. 5.29. and yet both theſe were weaker then in either of theſe eſtates, at their firſt beginning: As the plants, corne, and graſſe, are firſt tender, then ſtronger, and at laſt ſetled and at their full growth. And thus much of the cogitations and affections of the three ſorts of Gods children, that it may be ſeene that they are not caried about of their luſts as the vnregenerate: but haue their hearts occupied in farre better manner.</p>

Full truly doe they verifie the Scripture, which ſaith, <hi>It is as eaſie for a Camell to goe thorough a needles eye, as for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of God:</hi> Well it were with them, if they could learne of thee to caſt vp their gorge, and to ſet leſſe by that, which aboue all things, yea aboue God himſelfe, though to their owne perpetuall ſhame and woe, they haue made their delight.</p>
               <p>But I muſt proceede. To ende therefore with laying forth any more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: how forcible is that of the woman in the Goſpell of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who hauing been (as <hi>Zaccheus</hi> had) a woman of notorious life; yet when ſhe ſaw that her <hi>many and great ſinnes were forgiuen her,</hi> had her vnchaſte life in ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> deteſtation, that in token thereof, ſhe made her eyes which had allured men to vncleaneneſſe, a baſen of water to waſh Chriſts feete, and her haire of her head, which had been abuſed to the ſame purpoſe, (now in token of vtter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing ſuch vngodlines) a towell to wipe his feete: and yet this deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not ſaid to haue been ſhewed toward ſinnes, which had not greatly troubled them, but they were thoſe, which had ſtucke moſt neere them.</p>
               <p>Now if theſe with many other could not allow their ſinnes, which by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

The leſſe ſhall neede to be ſaid of this, ſeeing it may, and that not obſcurely, bee gathered, by that which hath been ſet downe: both that they doe not (with the Puritanes) dreame of any ſuch perfection,<note place="margin">Luk. 17.10.

But becauſe they are not al ſpiritual, that is, ſpiritually minded wholy and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, as they are not wholy fleſh, that is, corrupt, but both theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries fighting together (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>one againſt the other,</hi> are in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſoules:<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> therefore it commeth to paſſe, that they are ſubiect through this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence and infection which is in their fleſh, both to the diuels ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and deluſions of the world, and they may bee caried after diuers and ſtrange luſts, and to commit outward ſinnes one after another further forth, then by the grace of Gods ſpirit their corruption be bridled, held backe, and ſubdued.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> kindled, and gather ſtrength to bring foorth fruite accordingly.</p>
               <p>And this may be, yea and no doubt is,<note place="margin">The ſtate of weaker Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> the eſtate of the many of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: ſuch eſpecially, as for want of good experience, and acquaintance in the Chriſtian life, and battaile, are more eaſily deceiued, and beguiled then others are. And hereof it is, that many haue been ouertaken, and oft doe ſlide, and fall daungerouſly, and are carried from keeping a good conſcience, and from well doing: And diuers commit thoſe ſinnes which they had long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from, hoping that they ſhould neuer haue fallen into them any more: But what then?<note place="margin">Theſe much differ from all wicked.</note> Are they therefore like to the ſundrie ſorts of the former wicked ones, of whom I ſpake before? No, nothing leſſe: for either they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wary and watchfull againſt them, before hand, leaſt they ſhould fall; and it is their greateſt care, that they may not fall into them: or when they ſee how they haue been ouercome, and deceiued, they lay it to heart by and by,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.12.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile it, and are much humbled to ſee how they haue been circumuented, and cannot be quiet, whiles they ſeeing God offended, are not reconciled to him againe. And on the contrarie, if they preuaile ouer their ſinnes, and hold vnder their affections, and keepe their conſciences excuſing them, that ſo they may walke with God and abide in his fauour;<note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.21.</note> then are they more ioyfull then they, who haue all that their hearts can wiſh.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 4 8.</note> And although all haue not the like knowledge, how to doe and goe about it; yet it is the earneſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> deſire of their heart to haue it ſo: In token whereof, euen the weakeſt which are new borne, are heauie and cannot be comforted, for that they ſee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually how they haue diſpleaſed God.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe I might ſay much more, whereby all that can iudge, may ſee, that theſe ſinnes are of infirmitie committed by them: and that they are haled and drawen to doe ſuch things, as in no wiſe they would, when they are come to themſelues, and when the ſpirit of God ouerruleth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth their looſe and ranging affections: neither would they haue been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after them, euen then when they were haled to the committing of them, but that they were weake to performe that, which faine they would haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> done. I ſay, who doth not ſee, that theſe men ſinne not like the other, but in ſuch wiſe as the beſt, and deareſt of Gods children in all ages haue done, who neuer fully ſatisfied themſelues (no not the beſt of them) in that which they did.</p>
               <p>And this is properly ſinne of infirmitie, when partly of knowledge,<note place="margin">What ſinne of infirmitie is.</note> but more through frailtie, an offence is wrought to the diſpleaſing of God: and when of ſuch an one it is committed, as becauſe he hath his heart ſanctified, would not doe it:<note place="margin">Note.</note> and yet becauſe the power of corruption at that time is greater in him, then the ſtrength of grace, therefore he was ouercome of it, and forced to yeeld to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> But I demaund whether any ſuch combat or conflict be found in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, &amp; workers of iniquitie, in them of whom I haue before ſpoken.<note place="margin">Wicked ſinne boldly.</note> Haue they feare before the ſinne committed, leaſt they ſhould fall into it?

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Alas! it is as farre from it, as is the Eaſt from the Weſt.

               </p>
               <p>This is plaine to them that haue experience in the Chriſtian life, that men walking among ſo many ſnares of the diuell, baites of the world, and meeting with ſo infinite rebellions, and luſts of their owne hearts, as cannot be expreſſed, but as we finde them out by obſeruing them, are not without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> continuall danger and hurt, if they be not acquainted with this holie watch and ward, that their knowledge may be as a light to them in this dark world, and their prouident care as a preſeruatiue from the infection of ſinne, which in all their dealings will meete with them: yea and (that I ſay nothing of them, who are without Chriſt in it) euen the beleeuers themſelues (I meane) doe find much annoyance, and diſcomfort in their liues,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.35.</note> which neither they needed to feare, neither ſhould finde, if this counſell of the Prophet were pretious to them.</p>

The vſe of the which being learned by the word, they are much check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and humbled to remember their boldnes, pride, and other faults: and ſomewhat quickened by a liuely hope, that God will againe bee intreated: alſo their hearts bee brought to ſtoope and bow to the will of God, more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> meekly and readily, and not ſo ſtifly to ſtand in their owne conceit, as before they did. After this manner, God is forced to call backe many of his: but had it not been better for them, without theſe ſharpe corrections, to haue made it their meate and drinke before, to pleaſe him in all things? But thus, their hearts being inlarged and inlightened, they ſee themſelues readilie to withſtand ſundrie temptations, which before they did ſo hardly reſiſt and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16851:85"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> gainſay, that they found it a continuall irkeſomnes and toyle to goe about it: or (that which was worſe) through hardning of their hearts, they would not ſee them at all, which was a ſore blemiſh vnto them.</p>
               <p>Now theſe and ſuch like, will any ſay, outſtrayings in them, till God by chaſtiſements call them backe againe, that they be not the fruites of an ill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered heart? euen as I ſaid before, it is the ill gouerning of the heart, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſuch excrements to come from it, and ſuch diſguiſing of the perſon, in whom it breaketh out ſo offenſiuely; the which therefore had need to bee looked vnto with all holie and religious care: which is the point now in hand. And although it bee the exceeding fauour of God,<note place="margin">An high grace to liue well, without the whip.</note> to correct ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> faults in his children, and to purge them out and amend them by ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly afflictions, rather then they ſhould remaine to the vtter ruine of the perſons: yet had it not been much better, that they ſhould neuer haue giuen occaſion thereof? and that they had been carefull to keepe themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in compaſſe, as ſome other of their brethren doe? Who though they be not (no not the beſt of others) exempt from the common frailties of Gods elect, yet doe they ſo labour to eſpie, hinder, and hold their corruptions vnder, in ſecret ſifting them, and ſuing vnto God with groanes and requeſts; that they breake not foorth openly to the iuſt offence of others, at leaſt rarely: ſo that it may bee ſeene, they <hi>keepe their hearts with all obſeruation and diligence,</hi> more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then the other doe.</p>
               <p>And yet for all that hath been ſaid, I denie not, but that the deareſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God may poſſiblie, nay eaſilie, as we haue ſeene, and are at ſometime holden vnder this bondage by Sathans ſubtiltie, ſome more then others:<note place="margin">The faithfull in part thus kept downe.</note> ſo that for a time they ſhall be more drowned in the loue of earthly things, or be caried away by thoſe which are ſinfull, then obtaine a delight in heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But by the ſpirituall armour of Chriſtians, if they be once well exerciſed in it, they may and doe thus farre preuaile, that they recouer themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and get ſuperioritie ouer their hearts, and finde and feele that God is chiefe, and all in all with them, to delight and ioy in him (as I doe not ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> why it ſhould bee otherwiſe with any ſuch as haue truly <hi>taſted how good the Lord is</hi>) and then they ſhall cut off numbers of ſuch earthly and noyſome pleaſures, as they were wont to ſolace themſelues with amiſſe, before they conſidered more aduiſedly of it. But will any gather, that I doe make ſo light a matter of ſinne (whiles I thus ſpeake) as though I thought, it might be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off as a burre hanging on our garment; which the holie Ghoſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Sinne is not ſhaken off as a burre. <hi>Heb. 12.1.</hi>

I graunt that theſe things are hard to ſuch as are not throughly ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> with the knowledge of this doctrine, nor inſtructed oft, and made famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly acquainted with the wil and louing kindnes of God (whoſe caſe is much to be pitied, and their growings cannot be great) yet it is moſt certaine, that where theſe things are often taught, and vnderſtood, it ſhall goe farre better with them then with others. And they ſhall with eaſe get victorie ouer their ſpeciall corruptions, as ſlouth, diſtruſt, and ſuch like: where as they, who are not acquainted and ſeaſoned with them, ſhall not haue experience of Gods power in helping them to ouercome the ſame; but be ſeruants vnto them, which they might otherwiſe haue maiſtered. Examples hereof, as we haue many; ſo that of <hi>Dauid</hi> doth declare it, when he was conſtrained to cry out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.5.</note> ſaying: <hi>Againſt thee (O Lord) I offended, and did this great euill:</hi> as if he ſhoull haue ſaid; my ſinne had neuer broke out openly in the ſight of men, if I had not let looſe my heart firſt, in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Such gouernment therefore, as euery of Gods ſeruants according to the meaſure of their knowledge, may haue ouer their hearts, I wiſh might be kept and continued: which doubtles, although it ouercome not all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet ſhould it weaken them very much, and diminiſh their ſtrength, ſo that the curſed fruites of them ſhould not ſo eaſily, nor ſo often breake fourth to annoy them.<note place="margin">Luk. 6.45.</note> 
                  <hi>The good treaſurie of the heart</hi> if it were carefully kept, would bring foorth better things.

For though it be no common thing to be found in the world; yet if men had a continuall care ouer their hearts, to keepe them well ordered, they ſhould ſhew it in their talke and dealings: at the market, in their buyings and ſellings, in their families, and among their neighbours, as well as among ſtrangers, and in all things about which they may lawfully be occupied.

                  </note> who ſhould be paterns of them. And who can ſay otherwiſe, but that it were a little heauen, to deale with, and liue among ſuch? Euen as we ſee it is a peece of hell, to dwell with them that are of the contrarie diſpoſition: As <hi>Iacob</hi> muſt haue been conſtrained to abide with <hi>Eſau,</hi> and as Gods people in their captiuitie, did with the Edomits. God of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> his ſingular loue (I confeſſe) reſtraineth many from the exceſſe of euill, that they would otherwiſe doe: ſeeing otherwiſe, none could be able to liue by them: But whereas ſome are thus bridled by good lawes, and ſome for ſhame and vaine glory, doe depart from much iniquitie; and thus patch vp a kinde of life among men: yet know they, that without religion (that is, a feare of breaking out of chriſtian bounds) which onely is to be found in an
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:16851:86"/>

But of this we may complaine and cry out, till we haue worne our tongues to the ſtump, without redreſſe. For the fowle ſtaines, and ſhamefull blots which are contrary to the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned vertues, are ſtill vſuall (as they haue been) almoſt euery where, both in many of the miniſtery and people, and ſo will bee; as though godlineſſe were tied to the Church walles, and to the pulpit. And for a further illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration and proofe of the benefit of the well guiding of the heart, this I haue ſaid.</p>
               <p>Thus we may ſee that the heart being well ordered,<note place="margin">Fruite of a well ordered heart.</note> will neither ſuffer the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> affections to ſtray farre, nor willingly harbour euill luſts: and though they may creepe in by ſtealth; yet by examination, we ſhall finde out many of them, and ſhall be readie, when they are found, to purge them out, and expell them alſo, before they ſhall (being ſo neſtled in vs) be able to poiſon our liues. Oh gaine vnualuable! for who can ſay leſſe of it? that by the benefit of a well ordered heart, we may conquer many daungerous ſinnes, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (for want of it) doe vſually commit, with ſhame and much ſorrow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying them. Now when we ſee the fruite of this well ſeaſoning and keeping of our hearts, in frame, what ſhould be in more account with vs? yea, what ſhould hinder it from being ſo? or what ſhould we thinke more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> needefull to be done, then the labouring for it, when we ſee it ſo great a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and ſuch fearefull bondage for want of it, to come vpon vs? But, alas,<note place="margin">Good moode.</note> this looking to our hearts by fittes, now and then, when the good moode taketh vs, as it is too common, ſo it is moſt daungerous; and ſuffereth not chriſtians to ſee, much leſſe to inioy one halfe of the ſweetenes, which God bequeatheth to them: I meane, if we gouerne and looke to them, but as men in the world commonly looke to their outward ſeruing of God: that is, to pray when night commeth, goe to the Church when the Sabboth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, to faſt when Lent commeth, and repent when death commeth. And ſo the wiſedome of the fleſh counſelleth vs to looke to our hearts ſometime: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> but that we reſolue and arme our ſelues that the heart bee thus looked to in all that we doe (as frailty will permit) and care had ouer it, that it follow the light of knowledge going before it, oh that is thought too heauie a burthen, and an eſtate too vncomfortable! <hi>To reioyce alwayes, to pray continually, in all things to be thankefull:</hi> as the Apoſtle commaundeth, 1.

And it is ſo in great part, becauſe it is a worke whereto they haue not been trained: but as they partly ſee by the examples of others, and partly alſo doe geſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> but not able to direct their waies ſoundly, as Gods word teacheth. Now the generall rules are theſe: Firſt, knowledge of dutie, with a deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therein. Secondly, practiſe of that which wee know; the which practiſe or indeuouring to follow that which we know, is that <hi>liuing by faith,</hi> or <hi>labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to keepe a good conſcience,</hi> which the Scripture ſo oft and diligently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth vnto vs. And for the better furthering of vs herein, theſe vertues are neceſſarie: vprightnes, diligence, and conſtancie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt rule to liue well, is knowledge.</note>And to begin with knowledge, as it is in all ſciences, profeſſions and trades, that they who goe about to practiſe therein, muſt needes haue ſome cleere and good vnderſtanding of thoſe things which appertaine to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſame; ſo much more in this practiſe of Chriſtian duties, it is requiſite, that he who beleeueth in God (for ſuch an one onely can be a practiſer here) ſhould haue ſome true knowledge, what is good and godly, that he may diſcerne it from the contrarie, and of things good, which are the beſt; ſo that by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I meane,<note place="margin">Knowledge what.</note> ſuch an inlightening of the minde to vnderſtand the will of God about good and euill, that wee haue with it ſpirituall wiſedome to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16851:88"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and referre the ſame to the well ordering of our particular actions, that we reſt not in ſeeing the truth onely, but approoue and allow of it, as that which is fit to counſell and guide vs: but yet ſo,<note place="margin">And to grow in this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> as euery one is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and attaine vnto that which I ſay, that both he may grow and increaſe in this knowledge, who is indued with the greateſt meaſure of it alreadie: and he may not be diſcouraged that hath any true meaſure of it at all. This knowledge, S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>muſt be ioyned with faith</hi> (that particular duties,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.5. Rom. 2.29.</note> as <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, temperance,</hi> and ſuch other like may be practiſed) and that <hi>not in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter onely, but in the ſpirit.</hi> And it is that, of which our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Iob. 13.17.</note> 
                  <hi>If ye know theſe things, happie are you if ye doe them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> This heauenly vnderſtanding, if it be loued and delighted in of vs,<note place="margin">VVith this knowledge muſt goe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it. <hi>Prou. 2.4.</hi>
                  </note> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired as gold, and ſought after as ſiluer,</hi> and not weighed and eſteemed of vs, as a thing common and of no value; will with her beautie ſo inflame our hearts, and ſet vs on fire with the loue thereof, that we ſhall thinke long, till we haue been led by it to the practiſing of that which we know (being the way to the King palace) which is farre more pretious then the knowledge it ſelfe, and will moſt certainly follow the ſame. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou. 2.10.</hi> Without this delight no fruit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> 
                  <hi>If knowledge once enter into thine heart, and wiſedome delight thy ſoule, then ſhall vnderstanding preſerue thee, and counſell ſhall keepe and direct thee.</hi> And they who haue not this knowledge in greateſt account, and delight not in it, whatſoeuer learning, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> wiſedome they haue, they are as farre from practiſe of it, or bringing foorth the fruite thereof in their liues, otherwiſe then ciuilly, as if they were blinde and ignorant like the common ſort: which in <hi>Nichodemus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3 10.</note> 
                  <hi>a great man in Iſrael,</hi> and other of the Phariſies and Scribes is eaſie to be ſeene.</p>
               <p>And this is the cauſe why many which are learned, and of the Miniſterie, or otherwiſe, wittie, and acquainted with the Scriptures, are farre from a godly life indeede, for that they haue not their hearts led by Gods ſpirit to loue and delight in this knowledge of Gods ſacred will (vnles it be for ſome earthly aduantage, which they hope for thereby, or for vaine glorie) more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all other things beſide: nor ſpiritual wiſedom to ſquare their actions ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to the end they may follow it as their guide in their whole courſe, as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it worthy to ſet their delight therein: but account that a fooliſh thing, and eaſie to be attained (when yet it is the moſt pretious, and the hardeſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) yea, a farre more hard and difficult matter, then the getting of all their learning by labour and ſtudie. What then doe I ſay? that their learning and great knowledge is nothing?<note place="margin">Knovvledge an excellent gift.</note> or doe I goe about to deface and make both o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious? No, I am farre from it: but rather I ſay freely, that they are great and excellent gifts of God: and by many degrees, they may be neerer to an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie eſtate who haue them, then ſuch as want them.</p>
               <p>But yet this I ſay, that many which haue them, haue not therewith that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which giueth an edge to them, and which maketh them profitable, ſweete, and pretious both to themſelues and others: they haue not the ſalt of grace,<note place="margin">But without the ſalt of grace vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourie. <hi>1.

                  </note> which onely maketh them ſauourie, nor the <hi>loue</hi> which onely maketh them <hi>fit to edifie</hi> (whereas <hi>knowledge without it, puſſeth vp,</hi> and the <hi>tongues of Angels</hi> to expreſſe it, were but <hi>as a tinckling cymbale:</hi>) Neither haue they eye-ſalue to ſee that, except in humilitie they be content, yea glad to be led in their dailie conuerſation by the light and helpe of the ſame; they haue no other fruite

of it then earthly and tranſitorie: in oſtentation, and comparing with others,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to diſgrace them, and to be counted great maſters when they attaine to great applauſe; when yet indeede many of them haue not the ſweete fruite of it themſelues, nor ſhew that amiable vſe of it to others, as ſome meane countrie men which labour faithfully to make conſcience of that which they know. And I ſay with the Pſalmiſt, that he who hath fewer gifts of vnderſtanding, ſo as he liue after them which he hath, is wiſer then they: for thus hee ſaith: <hi>Thou haſt made me wiſer then my teachers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.99.</note> 
                  <hi>then the ancient,</hi> or <hi>men of experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue kept thy commaundements.</hi> Therfore with the Wiſeman I conclude, that the delighting in this ſpiritual knowledge, which I haue ſpoken of, is one ſpeciall thing, neceſſarie to the leading of a godlie and vpright life; without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the which the minde is not good, and conſequently the life cannot bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued:<note place="margin">Prou. 19.2.</note> ſo that they, who care but little for knowledge to guide them, haue as ſmall pleaſure in the godlie life, whatſoeuer they thinke of themſelues: to the ſhame of ſuch I ſpeake it,<note place="margin">The ſecond rule.</note> who ſay in their hearts, they know enough for their parts (for if they knew more, they muſt follow more.)</p>
               <p>Therefore condemning both bare literal knowledge, without the loue of, and delighting in it; and much more the loathing and contempt of it: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſhew, that with ſuch a well affected heart, we muſt practiſe that which is commaunded vs,<note place="margin">Col. 1.10.</note> that is, <hi>ſeeke to walke worthie the Lord, and pleaſe him in all things.</hi> And this practiſe is the ſecond rule to direct vs to the life of the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and is both inward and outward: inward, when in reſolution of our minds, and deſire and purpoſe of heart we doe it, Pſal. 119.10. Act. 11.23. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when in our liues wee expreſſe and declare the ſame in our walking, Act. 9.31.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Practiſe, is firſt in an heartie deſire.</note>But to begin with the firſt. We muſt haue our hearts prepared and readie to bee ſet on worke, and imployed in any good ſeruice to God, or our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as I ſhewed at large before in the renouncing of euill (and therefore the leſſe ſhall be ſpoken of it.) And this well ordering of the heart, is a moſt precious grace of God, as without the which, no good can be well done. But when wee haue ſuch awe ouer our affections, as to chooſe, deſire and delight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in that which we know to be good, and as occaſion ſhall be offered; yea and to bee vehemently grieued with that which hindreth vs therein: the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and powers of our mindes ſhall be readie to put in vre and practiſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>Therefore this inward readines of the minde and feruent deſire of the heart (we ſee) muſt be blowne vp in vs, and nouriſhed as a ſparkle or coale of fire: that (as it may bee obtained) there may bee ſome abilitie and ſtrength thereunto. For the which cauſe, the Lord requireth, <hi>that wee loue him with all our heart,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 6.5.</note> 
                  <hi>ſoule and might.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſtrength although where it is not knowne, there is felt no want of it:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> yet ſuch as ſee it requiſite in their actions, doe ſoone feele it to be miſſing, and a great piece of the beautie of thoſe workes which are done without it, to be wanting. As when they are gone about coldly and in deadnes of ſpirit: and ſo likewiſe, they can beſt tell, how well it beſeemeth their actions, who haue obtained it of God, and teſtifie it throughout the courſe of their liues. For when men vnderſtand, that God hath ſo appointed, that they ſhould be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16851:89"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in doing their duties, as remembring that of him they ſhall receiue their reward, <hi>and that his buſines ought to be gone about feruently</hi> and with conſcience;<note place="margin">Ierem. 48.10.</note> though they haue no great example of ſuch practiſe in the world, it will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them on with courage vnto the ſame, by the helpe of his ſpirit, which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thereto. And yet <hi>if the zeale of Gods houſe conſumed them,</hi> as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>it did him</hi>; this were no perfection, but that which ought to be laboured for, as euery one may attaine it; and in the whole courſe of mens dealings and duties to God, ſome meaſure of it: in ſo much, as where it is not found and inioyed of men, they ſhould count it their ſinne.</p>
               <p>And here this one thing is to be conſidered, that our affections of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and imbracing good things be ſo ordered, that they may be equally more ſlacke or ſtrong, as the goodneſſe of the thing ſhall be greater or leſſer:<note place="margin">Our affections muſt be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as the good is greater.</note> (as in praying to God, rather then giuing their due to men.) Alſo that (in an equall compariſon) the duties of holines to God, be preferred before duties to men: and with more bending our force and ſtrength, when we goe about to performe them, rather then theſe.</p>
               <p>And if it be demaunded here, how we ſhall come by ſuch grace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>How we come by this grace.</hi> Epheſ. 4.22. 2. Pet. 1.4.</note> as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhall be able to imbrace, chooſe, and follow the good, which we know: I anſwere: that we receiued ſuch grace, <hi>when we firſt beleeued in Chriſt; whereby our hearts were purified, and clenſed from the ſtrength of our old corruption:</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which (if we remember) doth warrant vs not onely, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath taken away the guilt, and puniſhment of our ſinne, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vs, and giuen freely his obedience; but alſo grace and will to loue pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and goodneſſe; and power, as <hi>to kill ſinne, ſo to quicken vs to newnes of life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.4.5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So that if we feele it not vſually, and ordinarily, we haue loſt and forgone it, either through our forgetfulnes, ſlouth or careles negligence: or if it be through infirmitie weakened in vs, wee ought to ſtirre vp our ſelues with cheerefull confidence, to the recouering of it againe, and not to be content to be ſpoiled of ſo great a treaſure. But if this earneſt deſire after goodneſſe, and vehement zeale of honoring God by that which we know, be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> whether it be ouerwhelmed with ſorrow, feare, or ſuch like paſſions, or dulled and made blunt in vs through lightnes, and in following the deſire of our hearts amiſſe, we are in no wiſe fit to honour God in any ſeruice. Thus much of the firſt part of practiſe, namely inward.</p>
               <p>I will now goe forward with the ſecond part,<note place="margin">As we deſire, ſo must we inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to do good. <hi>Pſal. 122.8, 9.</hi>
                  </note> which is a branch of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond rule, and helpeth forward to the leading of a godly life; that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers may, by it, be able to guide themſelues aright, and with much eaſe, in reſpect of thoſe, who be not acquainted therewith. And this it is, that in well doing, we ſtay not in our good deſires, and in the readines of the heart to doe good, but procure, accompliſh and performe the ſame duties outwardly; that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> we indeuor at leaſt, euen where we cannot performe, as occaſion ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and that in one commaundement as well as in another, ſo farre as it may be obtained. So that in all parts of ſanctifie and holines, which ſhall be wrought in, and by vs, this ought to be as a perpetuall law, that all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our bodies, and our particular actions, may all become moſt fit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and helps to ſhew forth, and expreſſe the ſame. And that is it, which the Apoſtle to the Romans meaneth, when he ſaith:<note place="margin">Rom. 6.12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Let not ſinne raigne in

your mortall bodies, that ye ſhould obey it in the lustes thereof, neither giue ye your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> members as weapons of vnrighteouſneſſe to ſinne, but giue your ſelues vnto God, as they which are aliue from the dead, and giue your ſelues as weapons of righteouſneſſe vnto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">All parts of our bodies giuen to ſerue God.</note>By this we ſee, that not only the heart with her members, that is, the cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and deſires in thoſe which are iuſtified by faith, muſt be conſecrated to the honour and ſeruice of God, but alſo the bodie with the parts thereof; the eare in hearing, the tongue in ſpeaking, the eye in ſeeing, &amp;c. that ſo we ſhould be his wholy: and in one part of our life, as well as another, doe that which pleaſeth him.</p>
               <p>No man doubteth, but that we ſhould doe good works, as well as haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> our mindes and hearts inwardly purged,<note place="margin">Make a trade of godlines. <hi>1. Tim. 5.</hi>
                  </note> but that we ſhould be diligently giuen vnto euery good worke, and make a trade of godlines, to applie and follow it; ſo that while we doe one good dutie, we ſhould not neglect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which in good husbandrie about things of this life is much regarded:) that few will grant, or be readie to yeeld thereto: yea and that <hi>our conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be in heauen,</hi> that is, that our common courſe of life ſhould be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly,<note place="margin">2.

Thus much of the rules: the vertues which further vs herein followe, which are, vprightnes, diligence, and conſtancy or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> perſeuerance.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note>The firſt then of theſe vertues, which ſhould make our practiſe both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward more pure and perfect, is vprightnes, and that is, when in a ſingle and true heart, we loue, chooſe and deſire, and doe any good thing, ſpecially becauſe God commaundeth,<note place="margin">Deutr. 18.13 Epheſ. 6.14. Iohn 1.17.</note> and for that end. This vertue was commended by our Sauiour in <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> when he ſaid: <hi>Behold a true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, in whom there is no guile.</hi> Many actions, otherwiſe feruent enough, for want of this ſinceritie, are but froth (as were the hot enterpriſes of <hi>Iehu</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt idolaters) and cauſe them who haue long pleaſed themſelues therein, at length, to crie out of their doings (though admirable in the eyes of others)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and to ſay, they were but hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>There are many ſtarting holes in the denne of our hearts, and many waies we can deceiue ourſelues, that the good which we doe, is not as it ſeemeth: but as it is not all gold that doth gliſter, ſo the touchſtone of Gods word doth finde much droſſe therein:<note place="margin">Pretences in good actions.</note> yea, the Lords weights of the Sanctuarie doe proue them light and windie, which in our iudgements and perſwaſions were weightie and ſubſtantiall.</p>
               <p>We are brought oft times to be earneſt in good cauſes, and to further them, as for friendſhip of others, and for companie ſake: ſo for malice, for our commoditie, vaine glorie, and for feare of ſome ſore puniſhment or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> if we ſhould doe otherwiſe: when our pretence in all theſe, is, that it is good, and commaunded; yea and we meane well many times, and are fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in a good thing without theſe euill reſpects; and that partly for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God: but not only, nor reſolutely for that, but more for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſiderations, then that: Therefore we are found to be others, then we would. Although I would not be taken, as though I ſhould meane, that there
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16851:90"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> were no vprightnes, if any feare,<note place="margin">Pſal. 130.3.</note> or other fleſhly reſpects ſhould be mixed therewith (ſo as we be not ruled by them) for otherwiſe our beſt actions are mixed with corruption.</p>
               <p>And thus I conclude this point as the former, and ſay with the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.12.</note> 
                  <hi>This ſhall be our reioycing</hi> (if we haue any worthy the ſpeaking of) <hi>that in ſimplicitie, and godly purenes we haue our conuerſation in the world among men:</hi> This vertue therefore (I meane faithfulnes, and vprightnes) going with our practiſe, in performing the duties which we knowe, ſhall both ſet our ſelues about them with more roundnes, and (as farre as they can be diſcerned) ſhall cauſe them to ſhew more beautie to others, and raiſe more admiration in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> them.</p>
               <p>Now if this ſhould be thought needeles of ſome which ſhall reade it, that I ſpeaking of the true Chriſtian, doe vrge and require vprightnes and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenes of heart in practizing godlines, ſeeing I haue ſaid as much before in the chapter of renouncing ſinne: I anſwere, that it is alike requiſit in both: and that as well we ſhew integritie in the practiſe of good duties, as in the forſaking of euill. And thus with the rules, I haue ſet downe one of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues namely vprightnes: which is neceſſarily to be learned and kept of all ſuch as hauing obtained the gift of true faith, doe ſet themſelues to lead a godly life: I ſay, ſuch as haue true faith, becauſe no other haue any poſſibilitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to enter, and ſet vpon it. And if thou thinkeſt to ſet vpon the godly life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, thou ſhalt offer to God a broken peece of worke:<note place="margin">Neceſſitie of thoſe rules and vertues.</note> no better then the offering of <hi>Caine</hi>; although it ſhall ſeeme to thy ſelfe, to be as holy as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if thou haſt taſted aright of this gift of faith, and then going about to leade a godly life; thou being ſoundly inſtructed in theſe rules, before ſet downe, and perſwaded that they with the vertues here added, muſt guide and helpe thee to the right performing of all dutie; then (euen as skill and vnderſtanding of the rules in any ſcience or trade, with willingnes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour, maketh the workeman fit to vſe and practiſe it) thou ſhalt finde great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> eaſe, not onely in withſtanding the deceitfull baites of ſinne, but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly breake through many and diuers lets, which thou ſhalt meete with, that they ſhall not withhold thee from going forward in thy Chriſtian courſe. For it is mens naked, and vnarmed venturing, and going abroade in the world (which is as a ſhop of vanitie and inticements) it is this, I ſay,<note place="margin">Vnarmed ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing abroade is cauſe of ſore wounds.</note> that maketh them come home with ſo many deadly wounds, fearefull falles, and greeuous offences, (I ſpeake of the better ſort of people, as well as of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profeſſors, though the worſt ſeldome feele them) and they ſhall neuer finde it otherwiſe till they doe better addreſſe themſelues and be furniſhed, as hath been ſaid, to this great worke of Chriſtianitie.</p>
               <p>

               <head>CHAP. 14. Of the aunſwering of ſome obiections about the former doctrine, and of the other two vertues which helpe to a godly life.</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obiect. We cannot doe as we deſire.</note>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S firſt this, whereas theſe rules haue been ſaid to be able to carrie the Chriſtian beleeuer, in a well ordered courſe of liuing, ſome obiect thus: It falleth out often times, that we haue a very good deſire to doe that, which we know, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God; but wee finde no ſtrength to performe. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> further, they ſay; we doe not ſo much maruaile that we attaine not that which we ſeeke, when the Apoſtle himſelfe maketh the ſame complaint, where he ſaith, to will is preſent with me, but I finde no way to accompliſh that which I deſire. I will not anſwere this as the deuouteſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites doe, namely, that God giueth his grace, and we may receiue it if we liſt, although we haue no aſſurance of his fauour by faith: which is a meere mocking of poore people, whiles they are warned to ſeeke that with vnſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and vncomfortable wearying of themſelues, which they can neuer poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly finde:<note place="margin">Anſwer. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> But this I ſay, if this be oft and earneſtly deſired of thee (as it was of <hi>Paul</hi>) Gods grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
               </p>
               <p>And further, if thou haſt neuer ſo feruent a deſire to ouercome euill, and to doe that which thou knoweſt to be good, and yet haſt not thy heart poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the fauour of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> The beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods helpe is vaine.</note> and taken vp therewith, but ſtandeſt waueringly affected about that matter, thy deſire is not that deſire which I haue ſpoken of: neither therefore able to helpe thee in that which thou wouldeſt; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no fruite of faith.<note place="margin">1. Iohn 5.4.</note> For this it is, that ouercommeth all lets in the world, and no other thing, euen this faith I meane, whiles by it we are perſwaded that Chriſt Ieſus ſo loueth vs, that he is readie to doe any thing which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for vs: becauſe of the great fauour that he beareth vs, whereby we are made able alſo,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.</note> and in whom we can doe all things, as ſhall be expedient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> for vs.</p>
               <p>For as nothing can ſeparate it from vs, ſo he thinketh nothing too good, or too pretious for vs. So that he, into whoſe heart his loue is ſhed plentifully, is perſwaded, that as he hath ſaued him from the greateſt daunger of hell; ſo he will much more ſaue him from the ſmaller, of being ouercome of his corrupt luſts: and that he, who hath beſtowed by free graunt and ſure promiſe, the greateſt benefit vpon him, namely, the kingdome of heauen; will not denie him the ſmaller,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.10. Rom. 8.30.</note> that is, grace to liue Chriſtianly here on earth. <hi>For he that hath giuen vs Chriſt,</hi> by whom we haue the former, <hi>how ſhall he not with him giue vs other things alſo?</hi> And if, not as we would, yet that is beſt which he giueth.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the other part of the obiection, that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe did not finde grace to ouercome the rebellion of the old man,<note place="margin">VVhy Paul o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame not all rebellion.</note> that is, his corrupt nature: I ſay, it is true, that fullie and perfectly he did not: to the end, that he might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue a marke of his vnworthines, and ſin remaining in him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by remember, that it was of only mercie that he was pardoned, and the grace of God, that kept him from falling away from him. And for both theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16851:91"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that he might be abaſed, and kept humble vnder ſo great grace as hee had receiued: in regard whereof, he had (as he confeſſeth himſelfe) been exalted and lifted vp aboue meaſure: and laſt of all,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.9.</note> that he might from time to time finde ſweetnes ſtill in the forgiuenes of his ſinnes. But although he was not perfect here, as an Angell; yet was he not caried of his luſts into groſſe iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (as ſome dreame, becauſe he cried out and complained, <hi>I am carnall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paul was not caried into groſſe iniquity.</note> 
                  <hi>ſolde vnder ſin: O wretched man that I am!</hi>) And it was neceſſary that he ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and be grieued with the ſmalleſt rebellion or reſiſtance of goodnes, and with ſome vnfitnes to his calling which he felt ſometimes, and to other good duties: but yet Gods grace was ſufficient to keepe him, that he fell not into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that depth that he might haue done.</p>
               <p>But I haue in effect anſwered this alreadie by another occaſion.<note place="margin">VVe may looke for the like grace that Paul had in our meaſure.</note> Now to applie this to our ſelues, and not to bee glutted with it as many are, I ſay; that wee likewiſe through the ſame grace in our meaſure, may looke with good cheere to bee deliuered from the yeelding to our wicked luſts, which moſt dangerouſly incumber vs, as hee was from his: wee being reſolued, that our moſt louing father (for the tender care hee hath ouer vs) is alwaies <hi>looking downe from heauen, and beholding who is vpright hearted towards him</hi> (how weake ſoeuer) <hi>that he may ſhew himſelfe ſtrong towards him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Chron. 16.9.</note> and thereby ſupplie his weaknes. And thus the deſire to keepe a godly courſe being ſoundly plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in vs, and the ſame proceeding from faith alſo, who doubteth but that it may haue ſtrength to doe ſuch outward duties as are required, though weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:<note place="margin">1. Chron. 28.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> to endeuour at leaſt (which God will accept) though wee doe not alway preuaile ouer ſuch ſtrong corruptions, as oftentimes for want of ſuch grace doe maſter vs. But in thus ſpeaking, I ſhew what Gods children may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently looke for, not what euery one obtaineth. And except the ſinne of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continencie, againſt the which God hath prouided a lawfull remedie,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.9. Rom. 7.25.</note> wee haue both promiſe from God, and wee by the power of our faith, doe inioy ſuch victorie ouer other ſinnes, as whereby wee may walke without iuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe amongſt men, and keepe our peace toward him alſo: this being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that when we are craftily deceiued by the vnceſſant malice of the diuel, (although not without our owne ſlouth, ſleepines and ſecuritie) we haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, as in time paſt, and recourſe to God by the meanes of our aduocate,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.1.</note> and doe recouer our hope and hold againe.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue ſhewed, how they who haue a will and good deſire, may look for ſtrength alſo to performe in ſome good ſort, the duties which ſeeme ſo difficult and impoſſible to them, ſo that they neede not be greatly troubled with that obiection: howſoeuer there are many, and thoſe alſo fauourers of Chriſtian religion, who neuer finde nor feele the ſame. But becauſe many of Gods deare ſeruants finde it not thus oft times, neither are able to ſay,<note place="margin">Many weak<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> diſcouraged for want of this victorie.</note> that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> they feele this, but contrarily doe complaine that their life is full of diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for that they cannot ouercome the force of anger, impatience, raging, frowardnes, and ſuch like, neither liue godly to their contentation, although they deſire it: becauſe I ſay theſe may be diſcouraged by this doctrine, I would haue them vnderſtand, that I haue not in the former anſwere to the laſt obiection ſet downe, what euery godly Chriſtian doth or ſhall feele (as I ſaid before) but what God of his bountifull liberalitie hath prouided, that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16851:92"/>
they may feele and find:<note place="margin">Many know not their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> and how their eſtate may be bettered, and their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> libertie enlarged.</p>
               <p>Beſides, many good people doe not know this, in a long time what God hath bequeathed them: nay, many of them neuer know one of the many ſweet liberties and priuiledges of Gods children; but only receiue ſo much light from the father of light (and therefore are rightly called the children of light) as whereby they ſee the way to his kingdome:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.8.</note> and according to the knowledge they haue of his will, thereafter they declare and ſhew it forth in their liues; but nothing as they might, and as ſome others doe.</p>
               <p>Now to proceede to the other vertues which further our practiſe of a godly life: ſuch as receiue and deſire to attaine to the grace which I haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſpoken of, that is, to be more ſound and better ſetled in an holy courſe, they are and muſt be glad with all their heart to be diligent and painefull in this worke of the Lord,<note place="margin">The two next vertues, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie.</note> and to abide conſtant therein, that they may by theſe two vertues adioyned, nouriſh all good deſires, and holy endeuours, after they be once planted in them: and hold out the contrarie, whileſt they be not yet greatly troubled with them: and ſet on worke their knowledge in ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, as it may well be ſeene whoſe ſeruants they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Diligence and conſtancie bring great matters to paſſe.</note>This diligence and conſtancie, in whatſoeuer they be vſed, they bring great things to paſſe, whether it be in any trade, or in the ſearching out of things obſcure and hard to be found out, when only the light of reaſon is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> followed: and who doubteth then, but that in holy duties, wherein men are guided by the ſpirit of God, moſt excellent effects are brought forth of them?

And being once acquainted with the gaine that theſe bring with them, they ſhall doe as the merchants (who hauing their mindes ſet vpon their aduantage, ſuffer not themſelues to range after pleaſures, but buſily follow their trade which bringeth in commoditie) ſo
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16851:92"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that whatſoeuer part of the Chriſtian life they are occupied about (holding theſe for their companions) they may count it the moſt happie time, which is ſo beſtowed. For in ſo doing, they weane their hearts and mindes from much draffe and worldly luſts, which would, if they might be lodged there, much annoy them: and thereby they are much more readily diſpoſed vnto dutie, then ſuch as will not imbrace them: who being contented with any vncertaine and deceiueable perſwaſion of Gods fauour, and refuſing to bee holden within ſuch narrow ſtreights and compaſſe of this holie and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian counſell, that is, of going forward by diligence and conſtancie in their courſe, breake out oftentimes to their trouble, daunger, and diſcredit; when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the other are quiet and merie.<note place="margin">Many pay deare for their liberties.</note> And becauſe they account it bondage to bee held in after that manner, therefore they finde that they pay deare for their liberties, when they be after conſtrained to repent the ſeeking of them,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and yet cannot eaſily recouer their inward peace which they loſt for them, nor ſhake them off againe, when yet moſt gladly they would.</p>
               <p>And for want of theſe two, and through the contrarie,<note place="margin">Want of theſe daungerous.</note> ſlouth and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant vnſetlednes, in that they doe not ſettle themſelues to one good thing or other, euen the moſt of the godly doe not finde that ſweete fruite in their life, which is to bee found, namely, of ſafetie vnder Gods protection from time to time: but by improuidence, and wearines of well doing, they doe by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> little and little plunge themſelues into ſome deepe vnſetlednes, out of the which, it is hard to ariſe againe. Therfore <hi>Salomon</hi> in two words hath fitlie expreſſed them both, ſaying: <hi>Let the feare of the Lord be in thy heart continually:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 23.17.</note> which is as much, as a diligent care to pleaſe him with conſtancie therein.</p>
               <p>Thus as I haue ſaid, to theſe former rules and vertues which guide vs to liue godlie, theſe two are commanded, diligence and conſtancie. By the one,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.6.</note> that we be readilie prepared, as wee ought to practiſe good, <hi>and ſo reſiſt euill:</hi> whereas ſlacknes and no care, or too little, is condemned. By the other, that thereby wee may continually goe forward in doing good, and fleeing euill:<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5.3.6. Gal. 5.7.</note> wherein all ſtaying, ficklenes, or going backward, is very dangerous. Hereto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> belongeth that to the Corinthians, when he hath ſaid:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.58.</note> 
                  <hi>Awake to liue righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and ſinne not,</hi> he addeth, <hi>Be ſtedfaſt and vnmoueable, alwaies abounding in the worke of the Lord: knowing that your labour is not in vaine.</hi> And after; <hi>Watch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 16.13.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtand faſt in the faith, quite your ſelues like men, and be ſtrong.</hi> And this is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie aboue all things, that ſo wee may become that ſimplicitie which is meete for them who are in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now that this our diligence and care in all good duties ought to bee for continuance, and euen while life laſteth; let vs know, that the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth it to all his children: according to that which is written,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.12. Ioh. 8.31. &amp; 15.7.</note> 
                  <hi>He that abideth to the end, he ſhall be ſaued.</hi> And in another place, <hi>If ye continue in my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> word, and it abide in you, then are ye my diſciples indeed:</hi> and, <hi>Aske what ye will, and it ſhall be done to you.</hi> And yet this might bee ſpoken to ſmall purpoſe, if the Lord had not promiſed as much to his faithfull ſeruants; that they ſhal haue grace to perſeuere giuen them from aboue: as he ſaith by the Apoſtle: <hi>He that hath begun this good worke in you, will performe it vntill the day of Ieſus Chriſt:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.6.</note> Alſo to the Theſſalonians: <hi>Faithfull is he that hath called you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5.24.</note> 
                  <hi>which will alſo doe it.</hi> If it be demanded, how he will inable them, ſeeing there are many feares
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16851:93"/>
in their life of finall falling away: the ſame Apoſtle anſwereth this, in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Epiſtle to the Coloſſians, ſaying: <hi>To the end ye may walke worthie of the Lord, (and pleaſe him in all things) and be fruitfull in al good works,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.10.11.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; increaſe in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of God, ye muſt be ſtrengthened with all might through his glorious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer vnto all patience and long ſufferance with ioyfulnes.</hi> And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh to the ſame purpoſe,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 4.4.</note> thus: <hi>Greater is he that is in you</hi> (that is, the ſpirit of God) <hi>then he that is in the world,</hi> that is, the diuell. The fruite of ſuch a courſe is both an happie end here (as it is written:<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.37.</note> 
                  <hi>Marke the end of the vpright and iuſt, for the end of that man is peace</hi>) and happines for euer after. As wee reade where <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>I haue fought a good fight, I haue finiſhed my courſe, and kept the faith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>from henceforth is laid vp for me the crowne of righteouſnes, which the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the righteous Iudge ſhall giue me at that day: and not to me onely, but to all that loue his appearing.</hi> But I haue been long in the former points, and by occaſion haue ſhewed throughout the whole diſcourſe of the godly life, that it muſt be continued to the end: I ceaſe now to ſay any more.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing ſet downe theſe vertues which muſt guide vs to practiſe the godlie life throughout our whole courſe, it may eaſily bee ſeene how euerie man who is come thus farre, may prooue himſelfe a repentant perſon, and be apt and fit to bring foorth the fruits of amendement in his particular actions, and how his whole conuerſation may bee ſuch as may beſeeme a man of God, ſo farre as humane frailtie will ſuffer: wherein, becauſe wee follow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe,<note place="margin">Other two ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, humilitie and meeknes. <hi>Matth. 11.29.</hi>
                  </note> wee muſt know, that all our duties muſt be practiſed in humilitie and meeknes: for ſo he ſaith, <hi>in ſubmitting your ſelues to my doctrine, and in leading the godly life, learne of me to be humble and meeke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if hee ſhould ſay, if ye bee hautie and high minded, ſo as ye deſpiſe the ſimplicitie of my doctrine, and thinke it too baſe a thing for you to be ſubiect to; or froward and vntractable, that in ſome points ye wil hold back, though in ſome other ye be obedient, ye can neuer liue godlie, as God requireth of you. Theſe therefore muſt haue no place in Chriſtians, either Miniſters, or priuate perſons, but the contrarie vertues, as I haue ſaid: which are oft times in the Scriptures ſet downe together,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.2. Col. 3.12.</note> as well as in this place: that wee may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> know how needfull it is, that they ſhould alwaies goe together; and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there bee many goodly gifts in a man, yet if he hath not theſe, they ſhall loſe their credit, and beautie amongſt thoſe which behold them, and withhold their commoditie from him who wanteth them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Theſe alwaies neceſſarie.</note>And theſe two are not particular vertues which ſometime only may haue vſe, but ſuch fruites of the ſpirit as neceſſarily are required in all actions: ſo that at no time, humblenes of minde, and meeknes of ſpirit may be wanting. All theſe vertues (I confeſſe) are common, as well to the forſaking of euill, as to the doing of good: and ſo vnderſtand it, though it be put out of place. But I ſet them down here, ſeeing the former part of this treatiſe was ſo large. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> that which I haue ſaid of this matter, I wiſh to be well obſerued, that the life of the beleeuer is a continuall proceeding in the departing from euill, and endeuouring after duties, in ſuch manner as hath been ſaid: and a ſetled courſe in repentance, and a conſtant walking with God; and not an idle, or vncertaine ſtumbling vpon ſome good actions (whiles a great part of his life is neglected, and not looked after) he muſt not be ſometime at commaund,

               <p>The Lords ſeruice is not like the diſordered ſeruice of many vnreformed gentlemen, where, beſides the attending at table and on horſebacke, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders may runne where they will: but it is like to a well gouerned familie, where all are appointed their office and place, in one thing after another to be well occupied, and kept from idlenes; and yet not diſcharged thereby, to doe what they will after. So our Sauiour teacheth it ſhould be with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as with a ſeruant in a familie: who when he hath wrought in the field,<note place="margin">Luk. 17.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So that the end of one worke is the beginning of another:<note place="margin">Deut. 18.</note> and yet al with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out toile and tediouſnes.

There is much work in the Lords familie, as there are many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſerue in: And the ſlouthful &amp; idle ones, howſoeuer they can haue place ſometime in earthly gouernment, yet are they expelled from thence. And this is that which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> warneth vs, that we be neither idle, nor barren, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which we ſhall auoide, if wee be filled and furniſhed with the traine of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly vertues: as knowledge, faith, loue, patience, godlines.<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.5.</note> And herein is our heauenly father glorified, if we bring foorth much fruite.</p>
               <p>To this end we muſt know that Chriſtianitie is fitly compared to a trade, wherein men goe from one worke to another: and a Chriſtian hath many ſins to weede out, and to labour againſt, and therefore not careleſly to marre all his worke in an houre, that he hath well followed ſundrie daies: as he that loſeth all that he hath by a caſt at dice. He hath alſo many duties to looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, towards God, his neighbour, and himſelfe: wherein it ſhall bee found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for him to be carefull, after the doing of one, to goe to another: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not to admit any thing againſt the peace of his conſcience, no not in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, nor in his weightieſt worldly dealings, feaſtings, companie, &amp;c. but to ſee the vnitie of the ſpirit kept in the bond of peace.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.3.</note> And as the Phiſitions doe wel direct, that for the preſeruing of bodily health, it is good to riſe from our meate with an appetite, and not to ouercharge the ſtomack: ſo it is none of the meaneſt rules for maintaining our ſoules health, to keepe alwaies an appetite to ſome new dutie, when we haue performed the old, and not to be ſo wearied in the doing of one, that wee bee vtterly vnfit to goe about ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

But alas, this knowledge of God is weake euen in many a true Chriſtian beleeuer: but that euery one is then fit to learne it aright, when he is once a Chriſtian. Furthermore, we muſt acknowledge, that is, allow, and in heart, yeeld and conſent vnto the truth of thoſe things which we know of him: that then we may ſafely and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> boldly beleeue in him, and cleaue to him.

               <p>But ſeeing the Scripture teacheth, that he is not a Iew, which is ſo onely in the eyes of men; neither is the drawing neere with the lips and bodie onely,<note place="margin">Manner ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</note> ſpirituall: therefore the manner of doing theſe duties in Gods outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is alſo to be learned (as in a word I haue touched before) that as in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues they are good and godly; ſo they may, as they come from the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, be alſo ſweete and ſauourie in the Lords noſtrils, namely, that (as they proceede from faith) ſo they may be ſeaſoned with holie affections, as oft as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they are offered to him.</p>
               <p>So that wee are to know this, that when wee ſhall ſet vpon any part of his worſhip, which now hath been ſpoken of, it is highly diſpleaſing to him, to goe about the ſame lightly, raſhly, falſely, hypocritically, and vnprofitably: for that were abominable to him, as a dead ſacrifice. But contrarily, wee muſt vſe them with al high reuerence, being prepared rightly before: wel affected in the vſing of them: and ayming at the moſt profitable end which he hath appointed, that ſo we may be approoued and allowed of him.</p>
               <p>Now if I ſhould particularly declare how and after what manner, euery part of the outward worſhipping of God ſhould be vſed, as I haue ſhewed in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> generall; I ſhould tarie too long in this matter:<note place="margin">Hovv Gods worſhip is to be vſed.

                  </note> but in ſome few of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalleſt particulars I will ſhew it, that thereby may be ſeene what is required in the reſt. In the preaching of the word, being the way to inlighten vs, firſt with faith; and after, to ſettle and eſtabliſh vs in the truth; wee ſhould come prepared to the hearing of it after this manner: laying aſide all filthines of heart and hands, which might hold out wiſedome, we being readie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to receiue it with a hungrie ſoule: and therefore not raſhly, and little regarding what we goe about; neither comming with a captious and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious purpoſe to heare.

               <p>This is the right manner of hearing the word of God preached, which the Lord hath taught his people to endeuour after: as whereby he warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them ſingular fruite and bleſſing.

of many, neither reuerently practiſed, is a thing moſt vnſauourie and irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> vnto them.

               <p>And ſo ſhould wee in the beholding of the workes of God (as the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; with the Sunne, Moone, and Starres: the earth with her furniture,<note place="margin">In beholding Gods workes.</note> as the corne, graſſe, trees, and her large proſpect) take ſweete feeling of Gods Maieſtie, and beautie which ſhineth in them, reioycing with reuerence, that he hath giuen vs this cleere glaſſe to behold his face in (although this wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> muſt know that in all theſe inferiour creatures and workes of his, wee ſee not any part of his throne, but onely ſome part of his footſtoole:) which ſhould moue vs therefore, in all our actions to beware of hypocriſie.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore we haue daily vſe of theſe, I thought good to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them (yet in as few words as I could ſo large matters) how wee ought to vſe them: let the reſidue bee learned by ordinarie hearing thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furniſhed with gifts fit for this purpoſe, are appointed of God to make his people ſound and skilfull in them: that they may ſhew to the world, that the honouring of God, as it is ſet foorth in his word, is another manner of life then the world is acquainted with, and ſo bringeth another manner of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> honour to him, and comfort to men, then the imbracers and louers of the world can be partakers of.</p>

Which thing, if it be of ignorance, is a ſhamefull blemiſh in them, who are guiltie of it, ſeeing they haue had ſo long a time graunted them of God, in which they might haue learned better: but if after it bee knowne, it remaine ſtill;<note place="margin">Iam. 1.27.</note> it plainely teſtifieth that there is in them a wilfull diſobedience againſt God, and that the beſt of their workes are in vaine.</p>
               <p>And before I enter into the particular duties of righteouſnes to all ſortes of men, it is here as in the fitteſt place to be taught,<note place="margin">Beare loue to al.</note> which cannot be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſo conueniently added: That we haue this minde in vs, that we <hi>beare loue towards all men euen our greateſt enemies</hi>; from which ground and roote of loue, we may be readie to performe all the duties, which we ſhall know to belong to them from vs, required particularly in the commaundements fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: And ſecondly, that we ioyne with it an other generall vertue,<note place="margin">Brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> which is brotherly kindnes to Chriſtians, which are brethren with vs, which is an holy and eſpeciall loue of one faithfull brother towards another.

                  <hi>If I did contemne the iudgement of my ſeruant, and of my maide, when they did contend with me, what then ſhall I anſwere, when God ſtandeth vp againſt me?

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Viſit the ſicke.</note>The ſecond example is of ſuch as our Sauiour ſpeaketh of, who viſited him in his members (though many other who ſaw their miſerie did not ſo)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſaying:<note place="margin">Matth. 25.35.</note> 
                  <hi>When I was hungrie ye gaue me meate:</hi> Here by his owne words, we may ſee, that true compaſſion will ſhew it ſelfe by releeuing in time of neede, and ſhutteth not vp it ſelfe with an vnſauorie anſwere,<note place="margin">Iam. 2.16.</note> as <hi>Iames</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>God prouide for you.</hi> And as we ſhould ſhew our helpe, chiefely to the needie and poore, ſo ought we euer to be readie to helpe all other with whom we liue, as they ſhall ſtand in neede of it, by counſell, trauaile or the like: euen as <hi>Simeon</hi> did his brother <hi>Iudah</hi> againſt the Cananites:<note place="margin">Iudg. 1.3.</note> and the reſt of the tribes did <hi>Gideon</hi> againſt <hi>Midian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iudg. 6.35.</note> and the Amalekites.</p>
               <p>But I will with adding a little more now make an ende of this dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the life of our neighbour: That which I haue ſaid thereof, may teach,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> how pitie is to be ſhewed to the bodily neceſſities, as to the whole life of the needie and afflicted; and likewiſe how we muſt be readie to helpe all ſortes that are diſtreſſed: and therefore much more to be harmeleſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Vertues they are of ſingular price, though little ſet by in this euill world: and yet he that is voyde of them, were better be out of the world. For both of them are accompanied with other vertues, which doe ſet out
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:16851:100"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the worth and beautie of them; euen as a chaine of golde, rings, and brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets doe beautifie, and adorne a comely perſon. For the latter, that is, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie and harmeleſnes, is accompanied with meekenes, patience, and long ſuffering, without ſtanding ſtifly vpon an offence, or hotly purſuing it, but ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily paſſing by it. Alſo he that is harmeleſſe, is gentle, tractable, and ſoone intreated to forgiue a treſpaſſe, though ſome can neuer be brought to it: he is alſo peaceable and communicable, and fit to be liued with; which vertue is rare to be found. Therefore the innocent and harmeles man is much to be ſet by: and as profitable to him who liueth with him, as of himſelfe, he is commendable. And this is to be ioyned with the other vertue, which in this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> place, I before commended, namely helpfulnes: and which hath adioyned to it, mercie and tender compaſſion to ſuccour them that be in miſery: and kinde heartednes and goodnes, as the ſcripture calleth it, to preuent euill and daunger from our neighbour, before it take holde of him. And thus much of the dutie which we owe to the body and life of our neighbours.<note place="margin">Pitie to the ſoule.</note> That which remaineth, is of the regarde and compaſſion which is to be had ouer their ſoules particularly. That ſeeing the multitude of bad examples is one eſpeciall imboldening of the world in euill: we,<note place="margin">Good example.</note> who are marked more then others, how we liue after the Goſpell, which we haue in ſo great price, ought both to <hi>walke warily towards ſuch, as are yet in vnbeliefe,</hi> as well as vnblameable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> amongſt our brethren, that ſo we may hope, that one time or other, it may pleaſe God to call them home,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.1.</note> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the beleeuing wiues: And who ſeeth not, that good example and innocent life, doth more moue the ignorant, and vnſtayed perſons at the firſt, then the doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though they heare it, yet they vnderſtand not the power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of it, neither are able to weigh the ſoundnes of it, vntill they ſee the beautie of it appeare in practiſe: And therefore he ſaith; <hi>Let your conuerſation be pure, that they which obey not the word, may be wonne by you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this holy example of life, another dutie is required, that all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be taken, and the oportunities vſed of winning men to God,<note place="margin">

If the deſire of the ſaluation of our brethren were ſuch, when oportunitie ſerueth, and eſpecially in companie, as that for the ſame, we could neglect our owne eaſe, and vaine liberties in idlenes, and vnprofitable talke; there is no doubt, but by kinde and wiſe dealing with them, we ſhould preuaile with ſome: eſpecially this one thing being added,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>thou haſt ſpoken to the heart of thine handmaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two former duties being rightly obſerued and duly regarded,<note place="margin">The ſeuenth commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> that is, that we honour the image of God in our neighbour, as it ſhall appeare to

vs, and that with this humilitie we ioyne tender loue to his life and perſon,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as now hath been ſaid: we cannot reſt there, but we muſt declare the ſame loue in not hurting or greeuing him in any good thing that he hath, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by: neither can we in truth ſay, we loue him, when we can be content for all that, to doe the thing which we know, will offend and vexe him. And therefore euery Chriſtian which hath this loue in him,<note place="margin">Not to attempt our neighbours honeſtie.</note> will be readie to giue his neighbour his due in this commaundement, not to attempt his hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and chaſtitie, which is principally forbidden in this precept. So that through this loue to our neighbour, and all that is his, we muſt liue ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and chaſtly, that none may haue cauſe to complaine, that they be hurt or annoyed by vs, this way: and that we our ſelues doe warily ſhunne,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and auoyde all occaſions, whereby wee know wee might bee in daunger thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Our minds and bodies muſt be chaſte.</note>Therefore for the better obtaining of this at our hands, God requireth this of vs, that both our mindes and bodies be chaſte: the one pure from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane luſts, deſires, and thoughts tending to vnchaſtnes: the other kept in honour (for ſo the Apoſtle calleth it) free from all executing of ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane deſires by any ſtrange pleaſures, which he condemneth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all the parts of our bodies be kept continent, as well as the face, eyes, eares, tongue, hands, and feete be turned away from ſuch occaſions, as may leade thereunto.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
               </p>
               <p>And this is commaunded to the vnmarried, and to thoſe which are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried;<note place="margin">Vnmaried.</note> but yet with ſome conſideration, and regarde had in the ſame.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nother part of righteous dealing with our brethren is,<note place="margin">The <hi>8.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> that they be not iniured by vs in their goods, which God hath giuen them, for their neceſſarie vſe and comfort in this life:<note place="margin">Not to iniurie in his goods.</note> And therefore, as we would deſire our ſelues to inioy with ſafetie, and without feare, the portion which by Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> goodnes is fallen vnto vs, euen ſo ſhould our neighbour liue by vs without daunger, or iuſt cauſe of complaining, that he is any way annoyed by vs. Loe this is the order which God hath taken and ſtrongly prouided for, that if he be regarded amongſt vs, we ſhall not dare be bold to iniurie one another in the ſmalleſt piece of his commodities, but giue him his owne, as the commaundement chargeth vs, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.8.</note> and as another Scripture ſaith: <hi>Owe nothing to any man but this, that ye loue him.</hi>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:16851:102"/>
And if we loue him, how can we grieue him, in withholding that from him,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> (as was ſaid before) which is deare vnto him?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Not lay claime to that which is another mans.</note>So that, where the caſe is plaine, that any thing is another mans, we cannot ſo much as lay claime to it, but God is deſpiſed of vs. But ſeeing it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full oft times whoſe the right is; and the moſt contentions, and vncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ariſe from hence,<note place="margin">In controuerſie.</note> that it cannot eaſily nor cleerely be ſeene into, whoſe it is indeed: here therefore, although men without Chriſt, will not eaſily be aduiſed, yet the Lord hath prouided, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat his ſeruants ſhall be ordered, for the retaining of loue and righteous dealing: That partly they ſhall forgoe ſomewhat of their owne right,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen. 13.8.</hi> To forgoe part of our right.</note> as <hi>Abraham</hi> did to <hi>Lot</hi> (if it ſhall be thought expedient) rather then to breake the bond of loue; partly, if it bee in ſuch a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> matter as is made doubtfull by the ſubtiltie, negligence, or other default of either partie (as when a bargaine is made, and yet left vncertaine in ſome point, which after breedeth contention) the damage ought to fall on him, through whom it came: and if it be otherwiſe ſo difficult, that it cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themſelues be determined, let other men of wiſedome take it in hand, that if it be poſſible,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.5. Matth. 5.40.</note> ſuite of law may be auoyded; and yet if that cannot be, let it in loue be proſecuted.</p>
               <p>Thus much generally, to ſhew, that God will haue equitie maintained in the comming by, and inioying of our commodities, and no man wronged in the leaſt part of his goods by vs. But for the more cleere beholding of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> duties in this branch of obedience,<note place="margin">Diuers ſtates.</note> or righteouſnes (ſeeing they are many) it is very expedient, to lay them foorth more particularly, according to the diuers ſtates of men. Therefore, as ſome are meerely poore men, and by Gods appointment and ordinance, doe liue by almes: other can in ſome ſort partly maintaine themſelues, but not without the helpe of others, by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing of them:<note place="margin">Luk. 3.10.</note> and the third ſort is able to lend, or to giue, or to do both: therefore according to theſe diuers ſorts of men, the ſeuerall points of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dealing one with another, muſt be ſpoken of: and thoſe which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this, ſhall be conſidered afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The dutie of them who liue by almes.</note>They who haue no other way to liue, or to be maintained, but by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> mens beneuolence, haue their proper dutie aſſigned them of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their neighbours goods, firſt to know, that their poore eſtate is allotted them of God, as the rich mans is alſo: according to the Scripture, which ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Sam. 2.7.</hi> Contentation.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord maketh poore, and he maketh rich:</hi> and therefore he is to liue in it with contentation. As alſo hee may doe, if hee know God to be his father through Chriſt his redeemer:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.8.</note> for there is incouragement enough from thence, to liue contentedly and comfortably in any condition, in the which God ſhall ſet him: For want of the which, it is, that neither poore nor rich are contented without hunting after that which is another mans. Now as it is the poore mans dutie, to be contented with his portion: ſo it is in no ſort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> tolerable in him,<note place="margin">Not to grudge. <hi>Matth. 20.15.</hi>
                  </note> to grudge at other mens abundance; for <hi>ſhall his eye be euill ſeeing God is good?</hi> Neither ought he ſo much as to wiſh the ſame, and ſo to iniurie his neighbour: but to receiue thankfully that which befalleth him, acknowledging ſuch to be Gods inſtruments,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.3.4.</note> and as it were his hands, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he miniſtreth to his neceſſities. And becauſe the people of God, which either ſent reliefe to the poore of other Churches,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.26.</note> as they of Macedonia, and

Act. 4.34.35.</note> as they in the Acts; they did it to incourage them, to remaine and abide conſtant in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell: therefore the poore which liue with vs, muſt know this, and looke to performe this dutie alſo, that hauing ſuch incouragement, they make it their chiefe worke to liue godly and obediently: That is to ſay,<note place="margin">Liue godly.</note> to glad their hearts, who refreſh their bodies, when they may ſee their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent conuerſation, and zeale to Godward according to their knowledge.</p>
               <p>But I lament the eſtate of the poore,<note place="margin">Iuſt complaint of our poore.</note> euen as I doe many thouſands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to thinke how few of them are fit to heare this their dutie with any hope to be the better for it: and what an vniuerſall blindnes and ſecuritie is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> amongſt them; ſeeing they are as farre from the deſire of true knowledge, as they are from poſſibilitie of obtaining it, yea though there bee offered vnto them a plaine and eaſie manner of teaching them: which as it is at this day for the moſt part, in that eſtate to be ſeene, ſo it ſeemeth to haue been vſuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch long agoe; that the poore liued for the moſt part without care of religion, as by <hi>Ieremy</hi> his words doth appeare. Who when he had, after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie, found, that there were few that ſought the truth, he ſaid:<note place="margin">Ierem. 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Surely they are poore; for they know not the law of the Lord: I will get me to the great men, for they haue knowne the way of the Lord: but theſe haue altogether broke the yoke, and burſt the bonds.</hi> God moue the hearts of them (in whom it lieth to redreſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it) to pitie the one and the other: and to haue a greater care of their good (by prouiding that they may bee taught the ſaluation, and happines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians) then they (being yet ignorant) haue care of themſelues: Euen to be meanes to bring light to ſome of them, who haue long ſate in darknes,<note place="margin">Act. 26.18.</note> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for the obtaining of the forgiuenes of their ſinnes, and the change of their liues.</p>
               <p>But I muſt remember, that I am in ſetting downe the duties of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians about the goods of their neighbours: although intire pitie hath mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to make this ſhort digreſſion. The laſt dutie therefore of this ſort of poore people, is, with the former, that as much as they be able, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> infirmities of age, blindnes, lamenes, and ſuch other, will ſuffer them,<note place="margin">Auoid idlenes.</note> that they redeeme their time from idlenes, and conſequently from other euill paſſing of the ſame, to doe any profitable worke which they are fit for, euer tying their hearts, eyes, and hands from pulling to them, or deſiring that which is anothers.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort that I am to deale with here, are they, who cannot liue by their labour alone, but ſtand in neede of the helpe of others by borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome thing of them, that ſo they may the better prouide for themſelues, and theirs. Their dutie is, carefully and faithfully to purpoſe the reſtoring of that, which they borrowed, at the day appointed, and that with thanks.<note place="margin">The dutie of the borrower. Repay truly.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And therefore in no wiſe to abuſe their creditor, by a diſhoneſt denying of it, or vnwillingnes to repay it: thereby, and by other delayes ſeeking to defraude him, and thinke hardly of him, if he requireth it; which to doe, is as if they counted it their owne, and a kinde of theft: and ſo they ſhut vp mens compaſſion from lending: For a chiefe cauſe of little lending,<note place="margin">Kind of theſe. <hi>Pſal. 15.14.</hi>
                  </note> is euill paying. It is further required of them, that they borrow not without neede;<note place="margin">Borrow not without need.</note> as many doe, to maintaine themſelues in play, and idlenes: for by that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:16851:103"/>
meanes they depriue him, who hath neede indeede to borrow, ſeeing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> lender cannot pleaſure both. And although they finde fauour to borrow for their neceſſitie, yet they muſt not looke to borrow that, which they are not like to pay againe, by taking more dealings into their hands, then their abilitie will ſerue vnto: for many vndoe themſelues, and others, by that meanes: much leſſe may they borrow to lend to another for vſurie, as we call it.<note place="margin">If they cannot keepe day.</note> Laſtly, if their ſimple meaning in purpoſing to repay it at the due time, be diſappointed; yet their care muſt be, to ſatisfie their creditor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him, with promiſing new day, and paying part, and euery way that they can (except it be forgiuen them altogether) to ſhew, that they were not faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor negligent in this matter.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>

But yet it is lawfull for him to take a pledge of him, if he doubt of his credit, ſo that it bee not his bed,<note place="margin">Exod. 21.26.</note> or ſuch a neceſſarie thing as he cannot well ſpare: And yet if he ſee that it cannot be repayed without hazard of his vndoing, he muſt beare with him, and ſhew compaſſion either for a time, or forgiuing it wholy vnto him.<note place="margin">Matth. 18.25.</note>

                  <hi>that we may doe good to them.</hi> But all is too little for mens ſelues, by meanes either of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious waſting; as exceſſe and needeles ſumptuouſnes of clothing, and prouiding for their bodies, or by a miſerable pinching and hoarding vp for their poſteritie; that they may exceede and paſſe their bounds; and that they may match any of their equalles to the vtmoſt: whatſoeuer commeth in by the yeare, or by the quarter, they haue a bottomles bag to put it in; none are the better for it, but themſelues and theirs: whereas indeede, none are more the worſe for it, then themſelues, and theirs, as we ſee it oft to come to paſſe; they themſelues comming to an heauie reckoning for it, their children for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the moſt part, ſpending it waſtfully. But I cannot now bring examples, which in ſcripture and experience, are innumerable. And whereas there are two ſortes of them, who haue goods for their deſtruction:<note place="margin">Two ſortes haue goods to their deſtruction.</note> the one hath no other thought abiding with him, but about encreaſing, though he know not why, and perhaps haue neither childe nor brother: of whom it is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the couetous neuer doth good, till he be dead,<note place="margin">The couetous doth no good, while he liueth.</note> like the water in the ice, which neuer is profitable, vntill it be thawed. The other ſort goe ſo farre in ſatisfying the deſire of the heart, and the luſt of the eye, and take ſuch pride, and iolitie in their life, whiles they haue that, which they would, that in ſtead of giuing and lending, they haue not ſufficient at the yeares <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> end to ſatisfie all their expences: what doe I ſay, to ſatisfie, when they are a whole yeares reuenue afore hand in charges, beſides other debt: ſo that they,<note place="margin">The lauiſhing ſpenders hurt ſuch as they ſhould doe good to.</note> who might with <hi>Iob</hi> haue comforted the hearts of many poore men by lending, are faine to greeue the hearts of many, and thoſe meaner then themſelues, by borrowing; or which is all one, by deferring of them, who haue neede to vſe it being their owne, that they may verifie the words of the wiſe man chap. 5.12. <hi>There is an euill ſicknes that I haue ſeene vnder the ſunne: to wit, riches reſerue to the owners thereof for their hurt.</hi>

Which if it bee well and duly conſidered,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.12.</note> will ſoone anſwere all conſcionable men, about the queſtion of vſurie and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that there can bee no vſe of them in the Church of God,<note place="margin">Vſury and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion haue no place among Chriſtians.</note> nor the Chriſtian commonwealth: the Law-maker hauing ſaid of both, as of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft &amp; of idolatrie, <hi>there ſhalbe none ſuch in Iſrael,</hi> that is, among Gods people. And as for teaching others their dutie (eſpecially in money matters) who haue not giuen themſelues in full reſolution to be guided by Gods word, Preachers may ſooner weare their tongues to the ſtump, then they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with them. But there is another thing, of which, ſome profeſſing the Goſpell, deſire to be reſolued, and that is about the buying and ſelling of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and whether they be not vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>Of this therefore by ſo good occaſion, as is here offered, I thinke it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, to ſet downe the wil of God and our duties:<note place="margin">Of annuities.</note> and the rather for the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of many about this point, and for the ſatisfying and anſwering of the well diſpoſed Chriſtian. For this purpoſe, we are to know,<note place="margin">VVhat they be</note> that by annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are meant, certaine yeerely rents or reuenewes comming in, for ſome yeeres ſpace: and that the owner may ſell them quite away for his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe, there is no more doubt, then there is of ſelling his patrimonie or inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance it ſelfe (if it be expedient) which is (as we call it) perpetuall.</p>
               <p>Now further,<note place="margin">Two kinds of them.</note> there are two ſorts of annuities bought and ſold among <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> men. The one is, a yeerely ſumme of money for yeeres, when the ſeller hath no ſuch annuitie, but as hee hopeth to make it of his labour and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The other is, a certaine reuenew, rent, or part of rent, which he inioyeth, and is willing to forgoe it. The firſt ſort is full of daunger, and cauſeth much wrangling, diſagreeing, and contention betwixt the buyer and ſeller.<note place="margin">The firſt kind full of danger.</note> And no meruaile, when that is bought &amp; ſold which the ſeller hath not: I meane, when there is no ſuch, either for him to inioy at his time, who hath bought it, or for the other to performe that hath ſold it: Much like them,<note place="margin">Men muſt not ſell that which they haue not.</note> who ſell Hops or Corne, before they ſee whether they ſhall haue any to performe or no. In this caſe, the change of the price cauſeth the one partie to repent him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and ſo hee ſtudieth how hee may ſhift for himſelfe, by what meanes ſoeuer.<note place="margin">Forehand bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines ſeldome end well.</note> And indeede no former bargaines doe commonly end without iarres and controuerſies: neither ought any to make them, before the proofe of their commodities, except they be both able to beare, and alſo willing to ſtand to the vttermoſt of the hurt, that may befall them. But to returne to annuities: let not him who is wiſe and peaceable, meddle with this firſt kind of them.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the ſecond, there is no doubt (as I haue ſaid) but that a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:16851:105"/>
man may helpe himſelfe with his owne:<note place="margin">The ſecond kind not vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> and therefore ſuch annuities may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> be lawfully and Chriſtianly bought and ſold. But where (then) is the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this kind of trafficke? I anſwere, it may be on the behalfe of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.<note place="margin">Yet abuſed on the ſellers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.</note> On the ſellers, by fraudulent and craftie dealing: as if he haue either ſold the ſame annuitie before to another; or if he know it to be litigious, and incumbred, and ſo he ſelleth ſorrow and trouble to his neighbour, in ſteed of a commoditie. This dealing is ſo groſſe, and branded with the marke of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie and diſhoneſtie by the Lord himſelfe, that I need ſay no more of it. On the buyers behalfe,<note place="margin">On the behalfe of the buyer.</note> the ſin and offence is, when he knowing the other muſt ſell, and within a certaine time, holdeth him off, as though hee cared not for it, to the end he may haue it, not according to the worth of it, and as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> will giue, but for a little; perhaps halfe the value, and ſo copeth him vp, and ſucketh out of him no ſmall aduauntage.<note place="margin">Such buyers are grinders.</note> This is a grinder of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Thus come in the annuities that gripe more then ten in the hundred, when the ſeller might, if he had had good meaſure, haue made his benefit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as much more.<note place="margin">Some annuities worſe then ten in the hundred.</note> This dealing, if it be vſed towards the wealthie, is ranke oppreſſion, when the buyer lieth thus in the winde, as it were, and will not giue according to the value: but if it be practiſed vpon the weake ſtated, and men behind hand, it is as the plucking off their skin from their bodie. If it be asked, what commoditie a man may reape lawfully this way: I ſay, if he buy the annuitie or rent of him,<note place="margin">How to redreſſe ſuch abuſe.</note> who is wealthie, ſo as there be plaine dealing, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> may ſafely inioy the benefit which the other offereth: If he be but weake or in debt who ſelleth it, let him be ſure he giue to the vttermoſt value, and in token that hee doth ſo, let him not bee vnwilling to releaſe him againe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: which ſhal alwaies proue, that he ſeeketh no aduantage by him. And this of annuities, both to direct a Chriſtian how to deale in them, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere ſuch as thinke (without any ground) that no dealing about them is lawfull, what our libertie is. Now that all may come by, and inioy their right in theſe, and in all other vſuall contracts, exchaunges, ſocieties, and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings amongſt men (for want whereof are the moſt broyles and contentions in the world) let this be, for concluſion marked, that truth in words, equitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in deeds, and ſimple meaning in purpoſes and thoughts, is to be firmely and conſtantly retained: and where that hath not been practiſed, full reſtitution is to be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reſtitution.</note>Now another dutie is, to reſtore to the right owner, the thing which wee finde, if we can know him, and not to count it our own. Alſo to reſtore faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and without delay any thing which is committed to our keeping for truſt, and not to defraud the partie: whether executors of the will of the dead, or guardians, that take vpon them the care of orphanes liuing: that as the beloued Diſciple <hi>Iohn</hi> being put in truſt by his Lord and Maſter, with <hi>Mary</hi> his mother to regard her, was faithfull, and <hi>tooke her home to him,</hi> Ioh.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> 19.27. euen ſo may they bee true and iuſt in that which is committed vnto them. The Lawyer alſo, to take no cauſes into his hands, which he ſeeth can haue no good end with equitie, and thoſe which he doth become defender of, to ſhew all honeſt faithfulnes, and diligence in following of them: That they in whom it lieth, make no delaies in the ending of the ſuites which come before them, but with all expedition poſſible diſpatch the ſame: <hi>that

               </p>
               <p>Laſt of all, to ſuffer all men to inioy their owne, and as neither by play, lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, laying of wagers, neither by force, violence, or any kind of oppreſſion; ſo neither by deceit and craft, we ſeeke or procure the hurt of our neighbour, to increaſe our owne profit. And thus I haue ſet down a ſumme of the chiefe duties, which our God hath bound vs to performe towards our neighbour, concerning his goods, that we be found no way vnrighteous in our practiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and dealings with him, but ſuffer <hi>him to liue ſafely by vs,</hi> as hee truſteth to doe:<note place="margin">Prou. 3.29.</note> wherein though I haue laid out nothing in any large manner (which was not my purpoſe to doe further then need requireth) yet he that conſidereth how many duties here are to be performed, ſhall ſee it the more needfull to haue a briefe rehearſall of them, being ſo many; to the which, as to a glaſſe, he may repaire when hee will, rather then to deſire ſome few of them, handled more largely, with omiſsion of the reſt. In theſe duties performing, who ſo ſetteth himſelfe to delight, and maketh it his pleaſure to walke after theſe rules; and when he can finde by due obſeruing himſelfe (that he hath taken any thing wrongfully) to turne backe vnlawfull gaine: as his libertie ſhal be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> great with the Lord, and his confidence ſtrong, when hee ſeeth that for his cauſe and for the hope of the reward promiſed him, he can be willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie himſelfe, and his owne will: ſo his example ſhall be highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and do much good amongſt men: And yet this ſhould not be to ſeeke with ſuch as goe for Gods ſeruants, as it is written: <hi>It is ioy to the iuſt to doe iudgement.</hi> And let it bee remembred that I here teach them,<note place="margin">Prou. 21.15.</note> who profeſſe that they are willing to learne, not the ſcorner. To conclude: let not onely the forementioned ſinnes againſt this commandement be auoided, and the contrarie duties practiſed: but let vs euery way ſo vſe our goods, that wee may be thereby <hi>more fruitfull in euery good worke,</hi> then we could be if we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them: elſe how ſhall we be able to giue a good account to our Lord and Maſter, and to ſay: <hi>Behold, Lord, here are thy fiue, or two talents: I haue gained with them many more?</hi> Luk. 19.18.</p>
               <p>The next dutie wherein we are to ſerue our neighbour through loue,<note place="margin">The <hi>9.</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> and to deale righteouſly with him, is about his name. Herein our loue muſt ſhew it ſelfe to be ſuch, that we be afraid to vexe or grieue him this way, as well as in his perſon or goods. The ſinnes haue been mentioned more at large, which are committed againſt this commaundement, the duties ſhall bee put in a narrower roome. One of the which is,<note place="margin">To reioyce in our neighboure credit. <hi>3. Iohn 2.</hi>
                  </note> to reioyce in the good report of as many as we can heare, and be perſwaded of: as the Apoſtle did <hi>for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> good name of the elect Ladie,</hi> who had ſo carefully walked after the Goſpell her ſelf, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by her feruent trauaile, he had found her children alſo doing the ſame.

                  <note place="margin">Hope the beſt.</note>Another is, to hope through patience for better things, then as yet can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> be ſeene in men,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.5. 1. Cor. 6.11. Matth. 7.1.

Concerning the reſt who ſinne boldly, I ſay: <hi>Let Baal pleade for himſelfe:</hi> for ſuch as defame themſelues by their wicked behauiour, are not iniuried by vs in giuing war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them. It is alſo further required of vs here, that as we ſhall be able, and may get good oportunitie thereunto,<note place="margin">To couer faults.</note> we helpe to couer theſe faults of theirs through loue, who may be recouered and brought to repentance: and yet not by flattering them therein, or diſſembling the ſame (for that is rancke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> hating of them,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19.17.</note> when we by ſuffering them to goe on in their ſinnes, cauſe them thereby to come to ſome open ſhame and puniſhment:) but doe we rather,<note place="margin">Iam. 5.20.</note> as the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> expoundeth this hiding of faults, ſaying: <hi>He that ſhall conuert a ſinner from going aſtray, ſhall ſaue a ſoule; and hide the multitude of ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rebuke.</note>Thus we ſhould labour to keepe them from an euill name (who are not ſhameles) and ſo from further daunger, by this our telling them of their faults; which if they be not yet gone abroade, may by it be amended: But as for open and bold defamers of others, they are not to be dealt with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, when their ſlaunder is ſpred farre, but to be cenſured by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that ſo taking ſhame for their ſinne, they may be brought to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And this remedie, as it may, ſo it ought to be ſought and vſed in loue, euen as the other by reproofe and admonition: and by theſe meanes (the Lord bleſſing them) both ſorts may blot out the remembrance of their ſins, both before God and men.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Not to diſcloſe vnmeete ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</note>To this dutie belongeth another, much agreeing with the former: that is, not to bewray a ſecret, when it may ſafely and without diſpleaſing of God, be kept in: For both this and the former go ſo heauily to the heart of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, when they heare that we haue no regard of them, where it might doe them good; neither doe ſpare, by inlarging of the report of that which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> was ſecret before, to encreaſe their miſerie and infamie: though they haue loued vs before, yet now their hearts are turned from vs (though that be their ſinne) for that they ſee vs not bearing a part of their griefe and ſorrow with them, but to publiſh that, which we know of them, by want of loue to them. For euery truth,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and the whole truth, is not alwayes to be vttered; although all kinde of lying and ſlaunder be alwayes to be abhorred. I ſay further, if we ſhould ſpeake of mens faults with bewailing them,<note place="margin">Not to ſpeake of faults.</note> or with a deſire that they, to whom we vtter them, might helpe to redreſſe them; yet could we not be iuſtified in ſo doing, except we haue vſed all meanes which we know, to amend them, and (when there is no other remedie) goe about the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of the ſame, as it were, vnwillingly; and in louing faithfulnes, reueale it onely to ſuch a one,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.15.</note> as is likeſt and fitteſt to reforme them, and not pleaſe our ſelues therein: In which caſe the houſe of <hi>Cloe</hi> ſent word to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  </note> in ſuch a caſe, when we may, is little differing from defaming him, our ſelues. Which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> was the ſinne of thoſe cruell Iewes mentioned in the Acts; who when <hi>Paul</hi> was accuſed as an euill doer, ſtoode by; allowing the ſame againſt him, who knew, that thoſe things were not ſo; and if they had rightly learned to practiſe this part of dutie, would haue anſwered in his defence. But the neglect of this dutie is the greater, if it be done in a publike caſe before many, as that was againſt the Apoſtle, when the Iudge will not giue ſentence, the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent will not ſpeake the truth on the ſide of him, who is falſely and vniuſtly brought in queſtion; and the accuſer will not let his ſuite fall, as they ſee they ought, and ſhould doe: but indirectly at leaſt, doe purſue him, either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſmall crime in him to be an odious offence; or when he is innocent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and cleere, yet charge him as a treſpaſſer.</p>
               <p>It is our dutie alſo, by our hand writing,<note place="margin">To giue teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</note> or any other credit bringing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whoſe good conuerſation is approued of vs, to free his name from vniuſt reproch: yea, and if the caſe be waightie and vrgent, ſo farre as we be priuie to his innocencie, not to be vnwilling to free him by our oath. There is yet another thing, wherein our loue ſhould ſhew it ſelfe towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as neceſſarily as in any of the reſt: And that is, by vprightnes of heart,<note place="margin">Take all in beſt part.</note> and kindnes to interpret all ſuch of his ſayings and doings, as may be well taken, in the beſt part; and not for ſome little blemiſh, and as it were halfe a fault, to deface the whole: and to be free from ſurmizing and conceitednes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> about that which cannot be proued, and brought to light:<note place="margin">Matth. 1.19.</note> As godly <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is commended to haue been in iudging of <hi>Mary</hi>; and as the Apoſtles, who iudged ſimply of <hi>Iudas</hi> himſelfe, ſo long as they ſaw him not conuicted. And this wee ſhould doe the rather, not to ſtand vpon the vttermoſt, as through vncharitablenes being able to beare with nothing: For who doth not know, both how prone our nature is to be medling, and going too farre? about ſuch vncertainties: and alſo,<note place="margin">Iohn. 13.28.</note> that when we haue concluded and giuen ſentence, as though there were no doubt in the matter, yet it falleth out of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, that we were (and that to our great ſhame) meerely ledde with raſhnes, and vtterly deceiued?

Like him in the Goſpell, who ſeeing our Sauiour to admit a penitent woman neere vnto him, who had before that, bin an offenſiue liuer, proceeded immediatly to this concluſion:
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16851:107"/>
                  <hi>If this man were a prophet, he would ſurely haue knowne what manner of woman this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> is,</hi>

As for thoſe, of whom we through charitie thinke the beſt, when yet we ſometimes ſee them prooue otherwiſe, and our ſelues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in them, I ſay it maketh no matter: we haue done but our dutie, to be charitabile minded towards them. And as for them, their ſinne is their owne, and ſhall double their puniſhment, in as much as they haue deceiued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> our hope, which we had of them: for if there were any ſparke of goodnes in them, our good hope of them, would make them aſhamed to deceiue our expectation.<note place="margin">Not too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note> Yet let vs not be fooles in iudging well of them, whoſe mindes and purpoſes we know to be euill by their words, conuerſation, and long knowledge of them, or by ſuch like teſtimonies of their profanenes and boldnes in ſinne: for that were vnſauorie and ſilly fooliſhnes: and (whiles we would goe about to be charitable) to ſhew our ſelues vngodly <hi>in calling euill good:</hi>

                  <hi>as ye would that men ſhould doe vnto you, euen ſo doe ye vnto them,</hi> ſhall condemne vs for it. Alas, doe we not ſee, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> all the incouragements and helpes, which wee haue in this life (through the exceeding naughtines of our hearts) are all little enough to carrie vs through all hindrances? and ſhall we then adde ſorrow to ſorrow vpon ſuch, as wee our ſelues are? or repine, that they may more eaſily go on to eternall life, by ſuch helpes as God giueth them? and therefore deſire that which is pretious to them, that ſo they may be holden backe, if not vtterly oppreſſed, through the want of them with heauines? It was farre from him, who ſaid,<note place="margin">Act. 26.29.</note> 
                  <hi>I would thou wert altogether as I am</hi> (that is, vnfainedly a Chriſtian) <hi>but yet without the bands which I haue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore let vs know, and reſt in this, that the marke which we muſt aime <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> at, is this: that in liuing with our neighbor, we deſire neither his hurt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, goods, or name; but count it the greateſt ioy y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee haue by our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and acquaintance with him, when we can reioyce in his welfare &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie both outward and inward:<note place="margin">Reioyce in his welfare.</note> and therefore heartily deſire and wiſh it from time to time, and in one thing as well as in another, and giue thoſe thoughts or luſts ſmall reſt in vs, which ſtirre vs to the contrarie: That ſo wee may declare, that we haue the ſame ſpirit which was in the Apoſtle; which taught him to ſay; <hi>I wiſh that thou proſperedſt, euen as thy ſoule proſpereth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3.

And the ſame I ſay of eating, drinking, mariage, recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proſperitie, youth, age, beautie, friends, ſtrength; becauſe I would briefly conclude with the Apoſtle in this wiſe:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.29.</note> 
                  <hi>This I ſay (brethren) becauſe the time is ſhort hereafter, that they which haue wiues, be as though they had none: and they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:16851:108"/>
that weepe, as though they wept not: and they that reioyce, as though they reioyced not:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not: and they that vſe the world, as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing it. For the faſhion of this world goeth away.</hi> He therefore that looketh to theſe things ſo, that hee liue in the vſe of his lawfull liberties, to make them ſerue him (that he may better ſerue God) and not he them; that man may be ſaid to be ſober indeed, and he ſhall haue great reioycing, whatſoeuer the world thinke of him.</p>
               <p>Theſe duties I haue thought good to ſet downe together, as it were in one view, before the eyes of the reader, that hee may fetch from hence, light to ſhew him the way, and matter to ſeaſon his heart and life, when he ſhal waxe emptie, barren, and forgetfull. And for the more large and full handling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> of them, or the exact ſetting downe of all particulars, it was not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and it would haue been too large, ſeeing in one Catechiſme or other, and in ſundrie treatiſes, as alſo by ordinarie teaching (ſuch as inioy the ſame) may be ſatisfied in that thing: which particulars, all true Chriſtians muſt be very carefull to know, after that they be willing to be directed. Now after what manner wee may draw a daily direction out of this whole treaſurie of godlines, it ſhall in fit place hereafter appeare, when I come to ſhew what way God hath taught vs to walke in, throughout euery day.</p>
               <p>And now I hauing finiſhed that which I purpoſed about the ſinnes to bee renounced, and the duties to bee practiſed in a godly life; here vnderſtand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that this renouncing of euill and turning from it, and the contrary practiſing of dutie,<note place="margin">The renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of euill and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is all one with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> is nothing els but repentance, and the ſelfeſame thing. And the bringing foorth of the fruites of amendement or of repentance, is all one with that liuing by faith, which the Scripture calleth the life of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, or a Chriſtian conuerſation. The which I make mention of, that none may thinke, that the godly life, the liuing by faith, and the repentant life, are diuers things the one from the other: which might raiſe much trouble in many to thinke: ſo that when they haue laboured much and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed painfully in one of them, they ſhould bee new to begin in the other. But ſeeing the holie Ghoſt in the Scriptures doth lay foorth the life of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> beleeuer in ſundrie manners of ſpeech (euery one ſetting out the nature and propertie thereof for the more full and cleere vnderſtanding of it) it is meete we ſhould not be ignorant of it.</p>
               <p>And as I ſaid, that this godly life which I haue written of, is all one with the bringing forth fruits of amendement or of repentance, &amp; liuing by faith, and no ſtraunge nor new or diuers thing from it, thus in few words I ſhew. Concerning the one,<note place="margin">Act. 26.18.</note> I meane the bringing foorth the fruites of repentance, what is it els, but for the perſon who is aſſured of ſaluation and of the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his ſinnes, to turne to the Lord, and to come vnder his gouernment, from the power of Sathan and ſinne? and in full purpoſe of heart to labour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to be reformed from day to day more and more? And what other thing in ſubſtance, hath been ſpoken by me in the deſcription of a godly life? And thoſe things about it I haue chiefly handled; which may eſpecially inſtruct the beleeuer,<note place="margin">Liuing by faith and liuing god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all one.</note> what true godlines is, and how hee may bee able to practiſe it. Now for the other, of liuing by faith, what is it alſo but a relying vpon the word of God, with full purpoſe to be guided by it, either by reſting vpon his
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16851:108"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> promiſes (I vnderſtand not here the promiſe of ſaluation) or obeying his commaundements? And a godly conuerſation is euen the ſame: that is, an endeuouring to liue after the word of God, which teacheth vs to beleeue, that he will inable vs thereto, and bleſſe vs therein. So that, he that liueth not godly, liueth not by faith: nor hee liueth not by faith, who doth not liue godly.</p>
               <p>And now to ſhut vp this point, namely, wherein a godly life doth conſiſt: a little more I will adde, of liuing by faith, as I promiſed in the beginning of this treatiſe, where I ſhewed that this faith to beleeue the ſpirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall promiſes of this life, muſt be conceiued and wrought in vs, before we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> can liue by it. We are therefore to know, that after the Lord hath giuen this gift of faith (<hi>for it is the gift of God</hi>) he requireth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil. 1.29.</hi> The godly liue by faith.</note> that wee ſhould liue by the ſame faith: and that is, not only to beleeue throughout our life, that we ſhall be ſaued in the life to come; but alſo, that we ſhall haue whatſoeuer is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to bring vs ſafely thither, giuen vs freely by the Lord in this life: I ſay,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.8.</note> faith reacheth to, and laieth hold of the promiſes of both, euen as God hath giuen vs both. So that to liue by faith, is a moſt glorious and rich preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, as we may ſee: and ſo ſhould we be able by good proofe and experience to ſay, if we would be perſwaded, but to take a taſte of the benefit and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that it bringeth: for if we did but taſte of it, wee would neuer ſuffer our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſelues to be withdrawne and plucked from it any more, as farre as in vs lieth.<note place="margin">The fruite of ſuch a life.</note> For by this faith, we are confident, and reſt quietly about our ſaluation from time to time; whereas others, who liue not by it, doe wauer and are oft vnſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, euen the beſt; and therefore much diſquieted. By this, we walke in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life, and all the parts of it: and by it, we may be aſſured in our prayers to be heard: againſt fearefull ſinnes to be preſerued; to haue the rage of our ſtrong luſts weakned: and to haue grace againſt them, although not alwaies to preuaile (which were not expedient for vs) yet at leaſt, to be in combate with them, which is euer a good teſtimonie of our ſafetie: for thereby, wee prooue that wee be of the militant Church of Chriſt. Yea and to goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> by this, if we liue by it, we haue deliuerance from many ſharpe and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter afflictions, and beare thoſe which we muſt goe vnder, more meekely and patiently, becauſe it maketh vs depend on Gods promiſes, and not to tye or ſtint him to any ſet time, any manner of deliuerance, or any meaſure of affliction. And by it wee walke in our callings more cheerefully, and with leſſe toyle and vexation, then they that haue all ſhifts, and cunning ſleights and deuices to gaine by: I ſay that which is incredible to the worldlings, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litikes, and hypocrites (but that is a heauie iudgement of God, that though they be told the truth, yet they ſhall not beleeue it.) For when wee are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that our callings are approoued of God, and profitable to men,<note place="margin">Faith maketh earthly buſines to be done cheerefully.</note> by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> maintaining the ſtate of Church, common-wealth, or any familie; and that they are thoſe, in which God will bee ſerued of vs: then wee take them in hand, not like drudges and droyles, who doe their worke for feare of the whip, nor like hirelings, who worke only for wages, and ſo they muſt ſtarue, if they did not worke: but we conſider, we ſerue the Lord, who is a bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paymaſter, and hath promiſed a large bleſſing vnto vs: and becauſe wee doe Gods worke and buſines; therefore we are aſſured that he will aſſiſt and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16851:109"/>
further vs therein, that both we may goe about it more willingly, and that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> may the better go forward: And therefore we disburden our ſelues of much needleſſe and troubleſome care and thought taking (ſeeing he hath ſaid, <hi>Caſt your care on me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.5.</note> 
                  <hi>for I will care for you.</hi>) Neither doe we make reckoning of our commoditie what it ſhall be, before God doe ſhew vs; but when wee haue ſerued Gods prouidence by lawfull labour &amp; trauaile, and vſed the meanes, we commit the ſucceſſe to him: and the fruite of our paine, we receiue with thankfulnes (whatſoeuer it be) and that we take for <hi>our daily bread.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Faith maketh our croſſes more eaſily borne.</note> And if we be croſſed in the good things which wee goe about (as euery calling and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile ſince ſinne came into the world, hath affliction and ſorrow adioyned to it) we doe here, by faith, conſider, that this is by the prouidence and good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> pleaſure of God, who ſometime croſſeth our good and lawfull attempts, leaſt wee ſhould be glued too faſt to theſe earthly things: and wee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, that God loueth vs deerely, and that of loue he chaſtiſeth vs, ſo as they, and all other our miſeries, ſhall in the end turne to our good, and therefore we reſt and vphold our ſelues in our eſtate with contentation. And this may bee vnderſtood of all other earthly dealings and actions, which are lawfull, and for the which we haue warrant in the word of God: aſſuring our ſelues, that whiles wee ſee God euer going before vs in them (as wee ſhould more looke to it,<note place="margin">Act. 2.25.</note> that we finde it ſo, then to our greateſt profits and weightieſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) this faith ſhall vphold vs in the quieteſt eſtate and moſt ſweete peace:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſuch as all the carnall wiſedome of man ſhall neuer finde nor inioy. For to ſpeake,<note place="margin">The vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers life miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</note> as the truth is, what a life doe the vnbeleeuers of the world leade, who will not learne what this life of faith meaneth? what ſinne doe they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in all kindes of their dealings, to the end they may bring that to paſſe which they would haue? for in God they haue no hope (for if they had, they would be counſelled and commaunded by him.) And although this doe not appeare and breake out, by and by, to the ſight of ſuch as are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant like themſelues; yet I would haue them anſwere me to this: From whence is it,<note place="margin">The proofe of it.</note> that they are often arraigned and forced to crie out fearefully; they are damned, and there is no mercie for them from God; they haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> done againſt their conſciences, and what ſhall they doe? &amp;c. From whence come theſe ſpeeches and complaints, I ſay? doe they not prooue, that they ſinned againſt their knowledge dangerouſly, though they would not ſee it then?<note place="margin">1. Sam. 28.15.</note> and that God will be reuenged vpon their wickednes, though for a while they beare al out boldly, as <hi>Saul</hi> did? Therfore be we well aſſured, that the ſinne of ſuch lieth at their doore: and one time or other it will find them out. For beſides their neceſſarie affaires and buſines, they runne into many needleſſe and ſuperfluous dealings, which muſt needes fill their heads with cares, and their hearts with ſorrow: And in their lawfull labours, they are ſo farre from depending vppon God for ſucceſſe, that they are euer fearing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> deadly, leaſt they ſhould be croſſed, and inordinately ſet on hope that they ſhall proſper and gaine: in both which, when they be diſappointed, how like to mad men are they? neuer contented with their ſtate and condition. In which caſes, how can it otherwiſe be, but that they be toſſed, as the chaffe with the winde? and neuer quiet nor cheerefull, but when they haue what they would: whereas if they did by faith build on Gods promiſes, they
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:16851:109"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſhould not neede to be vexed, as they are, with ſuch diſtractions, nor to ſpend their precious time as they doe in worldly cares: For they ſhould finde bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſucceſſe and more bleſſing with leſſe care and toyling of themſelues, if they would reſt on God and put their confidence in him, and they ſhould with free hearts and more quiet mindes, haue alſo more time to looke after the heauenly life.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus I haue after a ſort declared what the Chriſtians, and the beleeuers life is, and in what duties it conſiſteth: and haue diſcloſed in ſome ſorte, the ſinnes, which inſteed of this godlines doe poſſeſſe men: The whole I confeſſe hath been large and long: but therefore it muſt be conſidered, that the Chriſtian life is in a manner all the ſubſtance of religion, and that which muſt giue light and lend helpe to vs in all things while we liue: and therefore ſo great a matter containing all duties of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> perſons with the right manner of performing them, could not with any playnenes and profit to the moſt, that ſhall reade it (in my iudgement) haue been ſet downe more briefly. Onely this is here to bee looked vnto: that he may cleerely and ſoundly know, what is good, and what is amiſſe in ſome particular manner, and be the better able to gouerne himſelfe by that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge euery day, as he ſhall haue occaſion, which as I ſaid, ſhall further be declared in place moſt expedient: And to make this ſumme of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life, his glaſſe (as it is here, and by other writers ſet downe, according to the word of God) whenſoeuer hee ſhall repaire vnto it, to ſee himſelfe therein: Now heare ſome reaſons, why the beleeuer ſhould leade his life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thus.</p>
               <p>And firſt I will begin with that, which deſerueth the firſt place,<note place="margin">The firſt reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhould liue godly, is, that God may be glorified by this aduancing his.</note> and of right, ought to preuaile with vs: that ſeeing this Chriſtian courſe doth ſo highly honour God, it ought without all exception, to be ſought out and attained of vs: And how highly God is glorified in it, euery one may ſee, when euen ſinfull and contemptible perſons, who much diſhonored him by their bad conuerſation, yet after being reformed, are made fit to glorifie him? and if this be in their new birth, and regeneration at their firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to God, how much more (thinke we) ſhall it be in their life afterward? A miſerable caytife to be made a Kings ſonne, is admirable: but behold, here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> is more: for in Chriſtianitie, we finde, that he which was the bondman of the diuell, and of the familie of hell, is aduanced to the honour of the ſonne of God, and made heire and inheritour of the kingdome of heauen. And if this be honour to Princes, that they can giue great gifts, what is the Lords honour, in and by them, whom he indueth with other gifts, then all princes haue to giue?</p>
               <p>It was a great part of <hi>Salomon</hi> his royaltie, that <hi>he gaue ſiluer, as ſtones;</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd now that I haue added theſe reaſons to the deſcription of the Chriſtian, which beleeueth in God, I would ceaſe to ſay any more of this matter, if I did think, that men, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> haue receiued the Goſpell among them, were perſwaded and reſolued to yeeld to this doctrine, and to caſt away all clogges and cloakes of ſhame, feare, and other lets, and heartily goe about to practiſe the ſame willingly, when they haue heard it: But I know there are few ſuch.<note place="margin">This ſtreight courſe not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeelded to. <hi>Act. 26.28.</hi>
                  </note> For they who doe thus, doe not onely them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues walke after the rule which I haue ſet downe, aiming thereat, as at a marke, but alſo deſire that many other were as they be.</p>
               <p>But the multitude of ſuch, as haue either no faith, nor grace, but onely heare our doctrine, who yet profeſſe that they looke for ſaluation by Chriſt, doe thinke, that this which I haue drawne out of Gods word, and ſet down <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> for their edifying, is more then they neede to looke after, or trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with: which kinde of perſons ſeeing they ſwarme euery where, I doe oft ſay and profeſſe, that I oppoſe my ſelfe throughout this my booke againſt that their damnable opinion and practiſe, and doe bend the force of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſound reaſon againſt them.

               <p>And therefore, I would meete with ſome of the obiections, which they alleage, why they ſhould be no further dealt withall, but ſuffered to goe on as they doe in a fruitles, dead and dull manner. Some of theſe ſay,<note place="margin">Firſt obiection, againſt the godly life: this life cannot be led.</note> they hope their deſire is to pleaſe God, although they cannot doe it as ſome doe: and namely, ſuch as endeuour to follow this doctrine which in this booke I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> For my part, I doe not marueile, that they ſhould as it were ſhrinke and hold backe from ſuch a courſe, though they would ſeeme religious, as hauing not yet ſeene how great incouragement God hath giuen them to walk in it; neither what great cauſe they haue to lay hold of ſuch incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hauing many things to hinder them. Theſe perſons therefore, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them as will be teachable, and not reſiſt the truth wilfully, I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere; and giue them ſome worthie examples of ſuch as haue gone before them herein: that they may not thinke, they are preſſed too farre, and to do more then they need (if poſſibly they may ſee their error, and ſo finde grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter libertie and delight in well doing.) The which being done, they ſhall ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> what difference is betwixt the eſtate they are in, and that which they are ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp and called vnto.</p>
               <p>And that which hath perſwaded and moued me to this, is, (as I partly ſaid in the firſt entrance) for that I ſee many of good hope, and ſome not without a right and true beginning in this holie courſe, to bee kept at a ſtay,<note place="margin">Many long kept at a ſtay.</note> or driuen backe, and ſeeme not to know what the Chriſtian life is, nor in many yeeres to come thus farre, as to be perſwaded how pleaſant and profitable it is, and by how many degrees to bee preferred without all compariſon, before any other courſe. For many of the forwarder ſort, though they would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly forſake it, yet complaine, that they find much tedious heauines, ſtrong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> diſcouragements, and many relapſes which breed doubtfulnes and feare.<note place="margin">Complaine of much tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> Some which are weaker, are vnder deadly dumpes, ſtrange queſtionings, whether they ſhall goe forward or no,<note place="margin">Doubt of going forward.</note> and ſuch ſmall comfort they finde in their profeſſion, that they declare plainly, that they are farre from the ſtaied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which I ſpeake of: and this not at the firſt onely, but many yeeres after they haue liked well of the Goſpell.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Lam. 3.40.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſearch and finde them out:</hi> neither withholding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from new duties, which they haue not been wont to practiſe, but teachable and readie to heare, whatſoeuer the Lord hath to require of them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> And my meaning is, that after we haue made an entrance into a godly life, we ſhould not hold on by fittes, now and then (as I ſaid) and be off and on, as many are: but conſtantly goe forward, as our yeeres growe vpon vs, and carefully to indeuour, that in one thing as well as in an other, <hi>we may pleaſe God</hi> in reuerence, and in feare.</p>
               <p>Neither is it my purpoſe in all this, to perſwade, that beleeuers muſt haue ſome godlines (for that muſt be attained to,<note place="margin">We muſt grow.</note> alreadie; of all ſuch as I direct my ſpeech to) neither that they ſhould reſt in that which they haue: but looke vpon ſuch to follow them, who in the Scriptures are ſet before them, as the forwardeſt Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.13.</note> and holieſt examples: So that they acquainting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> themſelues ſtill with their owne wants, weakneſſes, and corruptions, which they beare about them, may daily gather ſtrength againſt them, and proſper as the Lords plants, in euery part of their life to become fruitfull.</p>
               <p>So ſhall they know by experience what this meaneth, which I ſpeake of, namely, to walke with God continually, and after a certaine manner (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wandering on the earth,<note place="margin">Double benefit of Chriſts death.</note> wrapped in with infirmities) to haue their conuerſation in heauen with him. And ſo ſhall they more cleerely and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behold the benefit of Chriſts death; that it was not onely to ſaue them from eternall death, and to bring them to euerlaſting life; but alſo to worke the death of ſinne our moſt deadly enemie, and to mortifie it, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> for them a comfortable paſſage thither alſo, through the inioying of many goodly bleſſings in this life, as pledges of the ſame, though it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe but a vale of miſerie, to all ſuch as finde not this for their portion. For this is to be knowne, that as euery one excelleth another in the graces of the ſpirit, thereafter is his meaſure greater in the priuiledges of a Chriſtian, more then others, and with more ſound and continuall comfort doth he paſſe his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:16851:116"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> daies, and free his life from reprochfull and fearefull euils. And the more that any godly man increaſeth in goodnes, and goeth beyond that eſtate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath ſometime been, in knowledge and in an high eſteeming of it, and the right vſe of the ſame; the more ſhall his life be filled with matter of ſound and pure reioycing.</p>
               <p>Therefore to conclude this matter: ſeeing the godly and Chriſtian courſe of liuing is not a ſeruing of God when we thinke good, but from time to time; nor a looking to ſome of our actions, when others are not regarded; nor an eſtate vnpleaſant to the ſpirituall man, whom the holy Ghoſt direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but eaſie, ſweete, and comfortable; ſeeing alſo we haue heard by many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> examples of godly men (otherwiſe not without their infirmities any more then we) that this life hath been practiſed in al ages: I conclude,<note place="margin">The elect muſt take vp this yoke.</note> that the elect and beloued of the Lord ſhall yeeld to the imbracing of it, and <hi>muſt take vp the ſame, though it be a yoke</hi> to the corrupt luſts not yet ſubdued: and that ſuch as ſee not cauſe to ſubmit themſelues to Gods commandements one as well as another, but will take their libertie in ſome euill, after the deſire of their hearts, cannot glorie with any ſound peace of a godly life.</p>
               <p>And conſequently, that the life of the common Proteſtant,<note place="margin">Life of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proteſtant no godly life.</note> which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it preciſenes to be abridged of any libertie that he hath been wont to vſe, or yet liketh to inioy (how vnlawful or offenſiue ſoeuer it be) is nothing leſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> then a godly and Chriſtian life: for ſuch a <hi>one will come to the light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.21.</note> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is not as it ought to be, may be made knowne, and ſo remoued. But he that will not be touched, nor ſuffer his actions to be cenſured, nor reprooued, though he be farre from this practiſe, but <hi>pleaſeth himſelfe in the things which he doth,</hi> is (without all queſtion) fraught and filled with infinit euils, and a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to his own luſts, whatſoeuer opinion he hath of himſelfe, and let ſuch a one know, <hi>that his damnation ſleepeth not.</hi> But many of theſe with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue to deale, ſuch as goe for good Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Another obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against this godly life.</note> and who in ſundrie of their doings are of vs well to be liked (though God iudgeth the heart) many ſuch (I ſay) doe keepe at a ſtay, or content themſelues with this, that they doe no great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> euill (although they doe little good) becauſe they ſee few liue better,<note place="margin">Obiect. <hi>2.</hi>

The truth is, that the generall ſtate of thoſe men, who imbrace the Goſpell, is much to be bewailed. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are infinitly the worſe, by reaſon of the ſwarmes of Atheiſts, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, Familiſts, and others, both Heretikes and Machiuilians, which with their ſtinking breath doe poyſon many thouſand inhabitants, which dwell in the land amongſt them: yet beſides this, the abomination is great with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> reſpect of them; through ignorance, little reuerence to the word, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in euill, and ſleight executing of ſundrie good lawes among vs: but this ought to be no offence to any. For who would looke for any other then loathſome life in the greateſt number, as it hath alwaies been? Chriſt himſelf affirming, that <hi>his flocke is but ſmall,</hi> Luk. 12.32.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this, in ſome places, and thoſe many, throughout her Maieſties dominions, where the Goſpell hath been ſoundly preached

               <p>Their names I ſpare for ſundrie cauſes; but ſuch they were, whiles they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> here remained, and ſuch they are, of whom I ſpeak, who yet remaine (though I know but few of thoſe many (I hope) whom God hath beautified his Church withall) as may iuſtly take away this offence from any, who ſhould thinke that wee haue none which may be paterns and lights to others of this Chriſtian, innocent, and fruitfull life: yea rather, it may perſwade them that there are many ſuch, as by good and long experience can teſtifie, that which is elſewhere written,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.12.</note>

               <p>As for <hi>Dauid,</hi> by the great wiſedome and goodnes of God, his fall was a glaſſe to behold Gods mercie in, not to imbolden any to ſinne thereby: and that like treſpaſſers who poſſibly might deſpaire,<note place="margin">1.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> confeſſion in the Pſalme, where hee ſaith: <hi>Againſt thee, O Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>againſt thee haue I done this euill:</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, though my offence be horrible before men, yet from hence it came, ſeeing I feared not before God ſecretly, whiles yet the offence came not foorth openly. And this I ſay, that we may learne to beware of inward temptations, and outward occaſions of ſinne, and boldly profeſſe to doe both.</p>
               <p>And thus I hauing anſwered this doubt of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that no wiſe bodie need to take hurt by it: yet becauſe I know how ſome doe draw ſuch examples to libertie in ſinning, and euen this one example as much as any other, turning it againſt themſelues, which they ſhould take good by; I will adde this one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> thing, which I would otherwiſe haue omitted, ſeeing I haue made mention of it before: That <hi>Dauid did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. King. 15.6.</note> 
                  <hi>and turned away from nothing, that he commaunded him, all the daies of his life, ſaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the matter of Vriah the Hittite.</hi> As therefore it was no vſuall thing with him, neither did he oft thus offend in caſes ſo well knowne vnto him: ſo it is no cauſe why wee ſhould be diſcouraged from a ſound courſe, for feare, leaſt we ſhould fall after the like manner, but watch in all things, that wee may be the further from ſuch feare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> (to ſay ſomewhat of him) before Chriſts aſcenſion,<note place="margin">Peters fall.</note> howſoeuer hee was faithfull, and in many parts of his life commendable, yet had he no ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> great ſtrength and growth in grace, that wee ought to be content to be as he was: but rather looke to bee lights and good examples in all good workes, leaſt we ſhould fall away daungerouſly, when ſuch an one as he was, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie his maſter. I knowe God can correct the deareſt of his ſeruants in as fearefull a manner. But (bleſſed be his name) wee know thus much of his minde, that <hi>he taketh no pleaſure in their troubles, neither delighteth he in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> much leſſe doth he take aduantage of their infirmities.<note place="margin">Lam. 3.33.</note>

               <p>And ſo it is with all others in this caſe, that ſo diſhonour God as he did. Now if he did fall, and we may alſo fall, whiles we are yet not without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, what is to be thought of our beſt actions, if we ſhould doe as many would haue vs, namely, to ſhew and profeſſe no more then others do; &amp; ſo make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon profeſſors examples, to be rules for our liues: what ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> our liues then be, but a very dunghill fraught with vnſauourie filthines, and not an offending of God lightly now and then?

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue ſet downe a deſcription of the life of the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: by the which all, who deſire to bee acquainted with it, after they haue obtained the gift of faith, may walke godly and ſafely through their pilgrimage, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo many as haue at any time in truth began, and gone about the ſame. Now ſeeing this Chriſtian life is vpholden and continued by meanes,<note place="margin">Chriſtian life is vpheld by meanes.</note> and euery one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which ſhall ſet vpon it, will be deſirous to know them, as he hath good cauſe, and how to vſe them aright, becauſe the hinderances and diſcouragements from the ſame are many and great; I will therefore (as it is meete I ſhould) ſhew what I vnderſtand by the helps, and meanes: and which they are; alſo the kindes of them, their nature, and how they ought to be vſed, ſeeing that God hath promiſed, by the right and reuerent vſe of them, and the ſame conſtantly continued, to giue ſuch grace, euen to weake
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16851:120"/>
ones whereby they ſhall be able in truth as hard as it ſeemeth, to leade this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> godly life, and ſenſiblie to diſcerne, that they doe ſo. For as it was not begun without meanes, ſo neither can it grow without them.</p>
               <p>Now as this doth wonderfully declare the goodnes and kindnes of our God, in ordaining of them for our exceeding great benefit and comfort: ſo we muſt know, that it is required of vs, and earneſtly looked for at our hands, that we vſe them with ſuch care and conſtancie, as that they may be moſt profitable vnto vs, that ſo we may finde that fruite of them which God promiſeth.</p>
               <p>Theſe meanes whereby God hath appointed that his people ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,<note place="margin">VVhat theſe meanes be, and their kinds.</note> and growe in a godly life, are ſuch religious exerciſes, whereby Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> may be made fit to practiſe a godly life: and they are partly ordinarie, that is, ſuch as are commonly and vſually to be practiſed, of which ſorte there are many: and partly extraordinarie, at ſome eſpeciall time, as faſting, and ſome rare ſolemnities in feaſting and thankſgiuing. And both of theſe are either publike or priuate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The publike helpes and which they be.</note>The publike, ſuch as are vſed in our open aſſemblies: ordinarlie, theſe are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> three. Firſt, the miniſterie of the word read, preached, and heard, as the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> preſcribeth. Secondly, the adminiſtration of the holy ſacraments, and worthy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> receiuing of the ſame. Thirdly, the exerciſe of prayer with thankſgiuing and ſinging of Pſalmes. But becauſe the publike cannot be daily had and inioyed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> (and yet we neede daily reliefe and helpe) neither although they could, were they ſufficient to inable vs,<note place="margin">The priuate helps, and the kinds of them.</note> to honour God, as it becommeth vs: therefore, God hath commaunded vs to vſe priuate exerciſes; whereof theſe eight be chiefe. Firſt, watchfulnes, meditation, and the armor of a Chriſtian; vnto the which, is to be added our owne experience: and theſe properly belong to euery one alone by himſelfe. The next are the vſe of company by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and family exerciſe; and theſe are properly to be vſed of a mans ſelfe with others: the laſt two, which are prayer and reading, are common to both. The neceſſitie whereof is ſo great,<note place="margin">The neceſſitie of the priuate.</note> that if they be not knowne and vſed right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in good ſort, the publike will proue but vnprofitable, and the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> life out of ſquare, as ſhall be ſeene when we come to handle and ſpeake more particularly of the right vſe of them.</p>
               <p>And of the helps or meanes to continue a godly life, which they are, and the kinds of them, thus much be ſaid. Now I will (as I promiſed in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into this treatiſe) more fully ſhew, what euery one of theſe, is; and what force they haue (God working thereby) to vphold the weight of a godly life: That all who liſt to conſider it wiſely, may ſee it, and ſo many as will vſe theſe meanes, may proue, and finde it themſelues. And firſt I will begin with the publike: and afterwards, ſpeake of the priuate. And I will ſo handle and ſpeake of euery one (according to the skill which God hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> giuen me) as may make moſt for this preſent purpoſe, that is, moſt largely of thoſe meanes which with their vſe, are leſſe knowne; and more briefly of thoſe, with which men are moſt acquainted.</p>
               <p>Neither let this trouble the reader, that I haue made mention of ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by other occaſions in ſome other places: for whereas it may be obiected, that theſe meanes called helps, are ſpoken of in other treatiſes of this booke,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:16851:120"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as parts of a Chriſtians dutie. I anſwere, it is true: for I haue ſpoken of vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes, one piece of the armour, and of watchfulnes and prayer, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer treatiſe; and ſo of the reſt. And there I ſpeake of them as of common duties and parts of godlineſſe, as the loue and feare of God be: but here I ſpeake of them as ſpeciall helpes to godlineſſe: for though I denie not, but that all the duties of a Chriſtian man, are alſo helps to liue happily; yet who doth not ſee, that theſe here mentioned, as the Word and the Sacraments, watching and prayer with the other, are more properly ſo called? as more ſpecially fitting vs for the right performing of all duties. Beſides, in other places, I ſpeake of them by occaſion, and therefore more briefly: but here, of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> purpoſe; and therefore more largely. But let it ſuffice, that I vnderſtand theſe which I mention in this treatiſe, to be helpes and meanes eſpecially.</p>
               <p>And more particularly of the armour and of the parts thereof, this I ſay: becauſe otherwiſe, I muſt haue giuen a watch-word about it afterwards, when I come to ſpeake of it in due place: that though I ſpeake of all the parts of it by occaſion in one treatiſe or other; yet there I ſpeake of them for the moſt part, as particular duties to be done in our ſeueral actions: but here I ſpeake of them, as of ſuch duties as muſt alwaies abide, and be lodged in our hearts: and that we may haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as a Larderhouſe, alwaies full of good and holeſome victuall, and not as one diſh to ſerue for ſome occaſion; where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we may obſerue, that though the one is not without the other, yet there is a manifeſt difference betwixt them, ſo that the one is not the other. And ſo I take it, the Apoſtle meant in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians: where when hee had named diuers duties, as mercie, loue, kindnes, Epheſ. chap. 4. &amp; 5. which are parts of the armour; yet he ſaith after, Epheſ. chap. 6.14. Stand faſt in your armour, when ye haue put it on: as if he ſhould ſay, it is not enough to ſhew kindnes, mercie, to ſome perſons at ſome time, and to haue the vſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the armour when occaſion ſhall be offered; but to put and keepe them on, that ſo we may euer haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a readines to be vſed: Euen as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe not onely trimme and dreſſe their houſes with flowers, but they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> haue alſo their gardens be ſet and filled with them, from whence they may haue them alwaies for ſuch vſes. This I thought good to ſay about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, to free the reader from ſome doubts. Now I will proceed to the next chapter.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Againe, this quickeneth them in their drowſines:<note place="margin">3</note> it cheereth them in their heauines: it calleth them backe from their wandrings. I ſpeake briefly of ample and large matters (wherein I might be long, and that alſo not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the readers good liking and deſire) it raiſeth them vp if they haue fallen: it counſelleth them in their doubtfull caſes; and wherein they are to ſeeke of aduice: and by experience of Gods dealing with them in all eſtates (how he bleſſeth them in well doing, and contrarily) by the experience, I ſay, which they haue, this preaching of the word of God ordinarily, is a meane whereby they are faſt ſetled in a godly courſe,<note place="margin">4</note> and keepe well when they are well, rather then fickle and inconſtant in the good cariage of themſelues, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> many are. And what a benefit is this? How is it ſought by many with teares, and yet of few obtained? yea of ſundrie Chriſtians thought to be impoſſible to be reached vnto, becauſe they know it not.</p>
               <p>And yet to this (as great as it is) doe euen they who haue had as weake beginnings in the Church of God, as any other of their brethren (by this heauenly direction taught out of Gods word) attaine and grow vnto. For when in a ſound, plaine, and orderly manner, Gods will is laid foorth in preaching, this helpe many do get by it, that they <hi>doe gird vp the loines of their mindes,</hi> that is, learne to lay aſide, and caſt off that which would hinder them; their inward corruptions eſpecially: they prepare themſelues to follow the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> rules, which leade and guide them to their dutie: by this they eſpie their weaknes, and how they are holden backe when they haue fallen; and which is the right way of proceeding: and this is the better done, the oftner that they are put in minde thereof. So that, this is the Sunne which giueth light to them in all places: and the rule by which they frame all their actions; and therefore a Chriſtian man though weake, being deſirous to learne, doth by this finde marueilous furtherance towards the godly life.</p>
               <p>Beſides this which I haue ſaid,<note place="margin">The fift benefit of ordinarie preaching.</note> the true Chriſtian by his ordinarie hearing is taught, to giue ſome part and time of his life to reading of the Scriptures, and other good writers, as is ſaid in another place; and that with good fruite, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vnderſtanding and comfort: whereas without it, he were like to neglect, and be wearie of that labour, and in ſteed thereof, to giue himſelfe to idlenes, and to bee vainly occupied; or though hee ſhould vſe it, yet to doe it with little knowledge, comfort, or any other profit.<note place="margin">The ſixt.</note> And when a man is framed thus by the miniſterie of the word, hee becommeth a light and an example vnto others, in token that he hath found great helpe by it himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Therefore if he may by the preaching of the word ordinarily <hi>be led into all
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:16851:122"/>
truth</hi> neceſſarie for him to know, and bee deliuered from errour in religion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and manners; if he may <hi>be eſtabliſhed and confirmed in the knowledge of the will of God</hi>; if he may be reformed in his affections and life daily, more and more encreaſing therein, and ouercomming himſelfe better thereby; if hee may both be brought to beſtow ſome time of his life (as his calling will permit) in reading, and ſo as that he may finde profit thereby; and finally if he may <hi>become an example</hi> in time vnto others: I may boldly affirme and conclude, that the ordinarie preaching of the word is a ſingular meanes whereby God hath prouided that his people ſhould grow and increaſe in a godly life. Now then, they ſo vſing it, as they haue elſewhere been taught, namely in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commaundement, that is, comming <hi>to heare with meekenes</hi> and hungrie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> harts, and being <hi>attentiue in hearing,</hi> and applying it to themſelues, they reape the fruite, which I haue ſaid.</p>
               <p>And if this be eaſily graunted and yeelded vnto, I ſay no more but this: I would to God that they, who are in great account for their religion, and doe oft and commonly heare the word, did finde it ſo, and did reape this fruite by it, and were holpen al theſe waies vnto godlines, which (God doth know) is ſeldome ſo. And therefore where this ſound and plaine teaching is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, how much more muſt the people needes be out of frame? But where the diligence, skill, loue, and plainenes in a good order of teaching cannot be found fault with in the Miniſter, it is certaine, that the fault is in the hearers:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> That they, though otherwiſe they may belong to the Lord, yet are not reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and attentiue in hearing, are not prepared before to heare, or els doe not digeſt willingly that which they haue heard; but are ſurfeited of ſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous qualities in their liues, or corruptions in their hearts: among which, this is a ſpeciall one, that as they thinke of the perſon who teacheth, ſo doe they of his doctrine, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Now if in this one meanes, ſo great helpe may be gotten, what may bee thought, when this and others go together? But I conclude with this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.2. 2. Tim. 4.2. Luk. 19.44.</note>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next meane or helpe publike, are the Sacraments, which (of the two) are more darkely ſeene and found to be helps to godlines, then the word, among the moſt part of thoſe who are partakers of them: both becauſe men haue ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domer vſe of them, then of other doctrine; and alſo, for that they be not ſo fully inſtructed in the ſame. And of the two Sacraments, which God hath left to his Church, in this latter age to be inioyed, Baptiſme is leſſe ſeene and perceiued to be an helpe, then the Lords ſupper: In ſpeaking whereof, I purpoſe only to ſtand vpon this which I haue taken in hand, namely, to ſhew the Chriſtian reader, how the Sacraments are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> meanes and helpes to ſet him forward in a godly life (as too few doe make them) and to leaue him for other knowledge about the Sacraments (which is exceeding large) to thoſe who haue written of them at large, as M.<hi>P.</hi> Martyr, M. <hi>Caluin,</hi> M. <hi>Beza,</hi> and to ordinarie teaching.</p>
               <p>And this alſo I will doe with as much breuitie as I can: Therefore firſt ſeeing the Sacraments are helps neceſſarily adioyned vnto the preaching of the word, and doe viſibly confirme and ratifie that, which the word doth teach: and the couenant betwixt God and the beleeuer made,<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confirme that which the word teacheth.</note> is moſt ſurely ſealed vp, and effectuall on both parts by them, thereby it may appeare, what helps they are, both to the ſtrengthening of faith, and incouragement to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> life: which that it may more plainely appeare, let this which I haue ſaid, be thus vnfolded to the Chriſtian reader. God hath freely granted to euery faithfull perſon, that he <hi>will neuer call his ſinnes to a reckoning: but will be his God,</hi>

                  <hi>and loue him to the end through Chriſt</hi>; for the making good of this promiſe, he hath put to his ſeale, and hath cauſed the ſame his promiſe and will to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in the ſacrament, by ſo euident and infallible a ſigne as cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. Now therefore doth not this ſacrament alwayes remaine to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full receiuer, to whom it is made out, and graunted; a cleere witnes, that whatſoeuer benefit is promiſed, is his: and as oft as any doubt hereof might, through weakenes ariſe to the partie, is it not hereby ſufficiently remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and therefore they are called of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And as God hath thus couenanted for his part;<note place="margin">VVhat, God and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doe coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, each to other in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> ſo hath euery beleeuer againe in his owne behalfe couenanted to truſt in God alwayes, to indeuour <hi>to walke before him continually in vprightnes of heart,</hi> and innocencie of hands: Now of the truth of his heart the ſacrament is a ſigne; which he hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, hath openly profeſſed thereby, that he hath giuen and conſecrated
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:16851:123"/>
himſelfe vnto the Lord, and is now no more his owne, to liue as carnall will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> would deſire. Is not therefore the ſacrament, though it be not alwayes recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, yet is it not alwayes before his eyes, as it were, to tell him what he hath done; yea and that not raſhly nor by conſtraint, but with good aduiſe, as knowing, that he ſhall neuer haue cauſe to repent him of ſo doing? ſeeing he beleeueth, that ſtrength in meaſure ſhall be giuen him of God, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which he hath promiſed and ſealed?</p>
               <p>Is not then the Sacrament a continuall ſpurrer forward of him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his couenant?

                  <hi>liue any longer in it?</hi> So that although to others the Sacraments be a <hi>myſtery, and hidden thing,</hi> and as a <hi>booke written in</hi> Hebrew or Greeke, which a ſimple man opening findeth nothing profitable for him, but ſaith I cannot reade it (and yet the booke containes moſt fruitefull matter, if a skilfull reader taketh it in hand:) although I ſay, he who is ignorant, finde no helpe nor benefit by the Sacraments; yet the true beleeuer hauing been ſoundly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed therein, beholdeth much in them, to incourage and ſet him forward in the godly life, hauing as ſure hold of Gods fauour, and helpe by them alſo, as the ſame God, <hi>who cannot lie,</hi> is to be beleeued.</p>
               <p>This may for the edifying of the ſimple, bee ſeene particularly in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> two Sacraments of our Church at this day,<note place="margin">Baptiſme how it is and helpe.</note> baptiſme and the Lords ſupper. For euery faithfull Chriſtian which hath been baptized, may as long as he liueth, haue this benefit thereby, that as by his ingraffing into Chriſt, <hi>he is one with him,</hi> and therefore ſeeth that while Chriſt liueth, he muſt and ſhall liue alſo: ſo he hauing thereby perpetuall vnion and fellowſhip with him, doth drawe ſtrength and grace from him, euen as the branch doth from the vine, that ſo he may liue the life of a Chriſtian. If then he haue that power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing him (which is ſignified and ſealed by baptiſme) namely the power of Chriſts death mortifying ſinne, and the vertue of his reſurrection in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him vp to new life; is not baptiſme throughout his life a forcible meanes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to helpe him forward in a Chriſtian courſe, as oft as he doth duely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Lords ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per how it is an helpe.</note>So in the Lords ſupper, the faithfull communicant, by the oft receiuing of it, is not onely by the bread and wine aſſured that his ſoule may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by Chriſt, and ſo inioyeth the ſame; but alſo is ſpiritually ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all good duties; ſo that he findeth a moſt ſoueraigne helpe by it, to growe vp vnto a perfect age in Chriſt Ieſus. And this ſhall more appeare, if we conſider how manifoldly the faithfull Chriſtian is furthered, and ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the well framing and amending his life thereby, both in preparing himſelfe to it before it come;<note place="margin">VVherein wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie receiuing conſiſteth.</note> in the action and preſent vſe of it, when he doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> come thereto; and after the inioying of, and departing from it. Of which three, ſeeing they may ſerue as well for a perpetuall rule to examine himſelfe by, and to direct him in the right vſe of it alwayes after, as well as to proue the matter which I haue in hand (namely, that the Sacraments are great helpes to godlines) I will ſtay a little while about them.<note place="margin">The manner of preparing our ſelues to the Lords ſupper.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And for the preparing or making him fit to receiue with profit, this is the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:16851:123"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> manner how it ought to be done, namely: Firſt, that he proue and trie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in theſe things, whether he haue the knowledge of mans miſerie, of his redemption, of his renewing, and of the nature and benefit of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the knowledge of other principall points; all which it is meete that he ſhould haue, who looketh for comfort by it. Secondly, that he hold faſt his faith in the promiſes of ſaluation, which God hath wrought in him before, by the preaching of the Goſpell: the which at this time may not be wanting, but holden faſt, and after, particular falles recouered. The third is, that he <hi>keepe his heart diligently</hi> to the renouncing, and ſubduing of all ſinne, and readie to any dutie that he ſhall be called vnto. Fourthly, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that he haue no ſwelling, nor riſing of heart againſt any man or woman, no although they be his vtter enemies: <hi>but be reconciled to them,</hi> and at peace with them, as he deſireth to be with the Lord. And fiftly, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus qualified, deſire (as he ſhall haue opportunitie) to be partaker of this Sacrament, and to receiue the benefit which God offereth by it. And this is the manner of examining a mans ſelfe: vnto the which rules he that is ſutable, he is a welcome gueſt to the Lords table.</p>
               <p>But becauſe much ſlouth, forgetfulnes, darkenes, corruption and weaknes do ſoone gather together, and ſo grow vp euen in good men, to the choaking of theſe forenamed gifts of God, that ſuch as haue ſometime found all theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in themſelues, yet at the time of receiuing cannot finde them; therefore at the comming to the Lords ſupper, God giueth eſpeciall charge, that if in any of his people theſe graces ſhould by their owne negligence and default,<note place="margin">VVhat is to be done, when we cannot prepare our ſelues.</note> be weakned, dimmed and decayed, that they doe not raſhly put themſelues for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to it in that caſe; but ſpeedily ſeeke to recouer themſelues againe, by a due examination of their eſtate according to the forementioned rules: Which if they do then more hardly and difficultly obtaine, and going about it, cannot ſee cleerely that they are thus furniſhed, as they were ſometimes, they may thanke themſelues; the fault is their owne, for that they did ſo long neglect the ſame, and did not labour, when they were well, to keepe well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> conſtantly: Let them not ceaſe therefore till they recouer; which of them that knowe how, being ſanctified, ſhall be obtained. Now the recouering of themſelues is on this manner: Let them goe apart by themſelues, and laying all other things aſide, ſeriouſly enter into due conſideration, what accuſeth them, and troubleth their conſcience, which in no wiſe may be omitted: then whatſoeuer bee found amiſſe (be it ſlouth, careleſnes, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, diſtruſt, vncharitablenes, or any other like ſinne) let it be ſenſibly and heartily bewailed, acknowledged, renounced, Prou. 28.13. and laſtly, a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of their faith, by apprehending Gods mercy, Prou. 28.13. and their wants therein, and in their repentance, ſupplyed againe, by renuing their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> couenant with God. This manner of behauiour in Chriſtians before they offer themſelues to the Lords ſupper, is neceſſarie after they haue fallen (as I haue ſaid before:) and herein ſtandeth their preparation to receiue the Lords ſupper. Which preparation is one of the three things neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, who ſhall with profit come vnto the Lords ſupper.</p>
               <p>And can this preparation be any leſſe then a great helpe to all,<note place="margin">How prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receiue worthily is an helpe to liue well.</note> which ſhall inioy it? He who was before ſnared in the world, who had been filled with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:16851:124"/>
ſtrong corruption, as with poyſon, fallen into ſome particular ſinnes, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> had neglected the nouriſhing of his faith, been at ſome bitter variance with his neighbour, or had done any ſuch other like thing: now by this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration calling himſelfe home, repenting and returning as this examination teacheth, doth he not finde thereby a ſingular helpe (thinke we) to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering of his ſtrength, and the doing of his former workes againe? And if he haue done none of all theſe offences (and therefore ſhall not neede to offer ſuch violence to himſelfe) but hath kept a Chriſtian courſe in his life, and followed a good direction to the peace of his conſcience (as I doubt not but many doe) yet as oft as he ſhall repaire to this Sacrament in this eſtate ſhall he not be much confirmed and more ſtrongly ſetled in the duties of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Chriſtianitie, when he ſhall by examination finde and ſee, that he (though fraile) is a meete gueſt for the Lords table, and therefore welcome; and not thruſt out of the companie, for want of his wedding garment? Shall it not be a great comfort at many other times, as oft as hee ſhall remember and thinke vpon it: and that it hath been thus with him alreadie when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and thus may be alſo, as oft as he ſhall repaire vnto it againe? So that euen the preparation to the Lords ſupper, is a great meane to goe forward in godlines.</p>

For although <hi>the fleſh ſtriueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit,</hi> as well herein, as in other workes of it; yet the faithfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant in his meaſure, findeth his heart readie to yeeld vp to the Lord in this heauenly banquet, no leſſe, then I haue ſaid, euen the ſacrifice of praiſe and thankes, though all doe it not in a like meaſure.</p>
               <p>And euen ſo to come to the third point, it is of the ſame force, after he hath receiued the Sacrament,<note place="margin">After receiuing the faithfull communicant is fitter to liue godly.</note> and inioyed the benefit therein beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to hearten him on, and ſtrengthen him to euery good worke; euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> as a man well refreſhed with meate, is made ſtrong to labour: this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (I ſay) doth after the receiuing of it (where right vſe is made of it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods appointment) through the remembrance and due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the kindnes of God therein offered and reaped, eaſily carry on the ſeruant of God in a feruent deſire of all well doing. In all that I ſay of the Sacrament, the wiſe reader (I doubt not) vnderſtandeth me, not that this alone, without other meanes and helpes doth this; but as the Lord in great fauour to his Church, hath prouided varietie of them for it,<note place="margin">One helpe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vſed, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not to be neglected.</note> as the weakenes of it doth require, as ſome publike, ſome priuate: ſo he hath made this amongſt the reſt to be one, by the which, as by the reſt, a godly life is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> much furthered.</p>
               <p>Which I thought very meete to adde, becauſe of all other helps to the practiſe of Chriſtianitie, I am perſwaded, that the Sacraments are leaſt thought, or found to be ſo: and that they are vſed for the moſt part, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the benefit which God hath ioyned with them, that is, in ceremonie onely. And this holeſome or right vſing of them, becauſe it is little ſeene or inioyed; therefore is there ſuch negligence in repairing to them, and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, diſorder, yea and prophane behauiour in the adminiſtring and receiuing of them, which is the principall matter that is to be regarded about the Sacrament, and looked vnto both of the miniſter and people.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But it is not my purpoſe to enter into this treatiſe: I conclude this point therefore, that ſeeing the Sacraments doe ſeale vp the promiſes of God to the faithfull receiuer, vnder a viſible and infallible ſigne, and againe binde him (in reuerence be it ſpoken) to the performing of his couenant, and ſeeing particularly the firſt Sacrament of baptiſme doth ingraffe him into Chriſt, and that other of the Lords ſupper doth by ſo holy preparation before he come, with ſuch comfort miniſtring in and at his receiuing, and ſuch ſtrengthening of him after, worke vpon him, as hath been ſaid; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacraments are ſingular helpes for all true beleeuers to growe in a godly life. And conſequently, I ſay of the receiuers of them, as of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> which vſe the other helpes, that he who is not made more able to conquer his luſts, and weaken the ſtrength of ſinne, and is not more hartened to the life of godlines, doth abuſe them, and ſeeth not Gods purpoſe in ordaining them. Which ſinne how ſeuerely God will puniſh,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.30.</note> the Corinthians example doth teſtifie and proue.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 4. Of publike prayers: alſo of the priuate helpes in generall.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He publike prayers ſolemnly offred to God in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and praiſing of him with Pſalmes, is another of theſe publike helpes. In the which, if that minde be in vs, with the which we haue been taught to come to all holie exerciſes, and ſo be prepared for them; who doubteth but that wee may receiue much helpe by them? yea and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> better a man is, the more he ſhall profit by them. For when the faithfull, from God himſelfe, haue a promiſe <hi>that they ſhall be heard in all things that are good for them, euen the moſt excellenteſt,</hi> and doe then emptie their hearts by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their ſinnes, and with the reſt of the godly, lift vp their ſpirits and voices together in praiſing him; is there any doubt, but that they are afterward in priuate more cheerefully bent to ſerue him? And in that the ignorant (which in the beſt places is the greateſt number) take no more profit by them, it is not long of the exerciſes, but that they are vnfit to receiue benefit by them: and a preiudicate opinion in ſome that they can take no good by them, and therefore partly in ignorance, partly in raſh zeale, they giue themſelues to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſleight and negligent hearing of them. The direct remedie to redreſſe both faults, as farre as in man lieth, were an ordinarie able miniſterie: whereby both the ignorant might (beſides other good things) learne rightly how to vſe them: and the preiudicate ones (which conceiue the worſe of them, for that they ſee ſmall fruit to follow of them) ſhould be ſilent and haue nothing to ſay againſt them, except with the Browniſts, they will deſpiſe all publike aſſemblies. But whatſoeuer the ignorant get, the children of God may find eſpeciall good refreſhing by them: which is that thing that I haue to prooue and perſwade. For when beſides our owne priuate ſupplications and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuings, we haue by the Lord himſelf, appointed for vs theſe alſo in publike:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and that in ſo ſolemne a manner, the whole aſſemblie conſenting with vs in the ſame,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> and <hi>God preſent amongst vs</hi> to aſſiſt vs, as he hath promiſed; the very ordinance of God (who is the author of them) doth promiſe a bleſſing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as oft as we are partakers of them. So that if we come with reuerence, and a feeling of our wants, with an earneſt deſire and confidence to obtaine the things which we pray for, in true repentance, we ſhall receiue fruite of them accordingly. But herein a preiudicate opinion, which is a raſh iudgement, doth much harme.<note place="margin">VVhat holdeth ſome from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like prayer.</note> For by reaſon of this, that the Miniſters haue been, for the moſt part diſordered perſons and ignorant, and too many remaine ſo ſtill; and thereby haue brought themſelues, by Gods iuſt iudgement, and their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> owne deſerts, as the ſonnes of <hi>Ely</hi> did, into diſhonour and diſcredit: it hath come to paſſe, that through raſh and prepoſterous iudgement, many haue had an euill opinion of that, which hath been done by them, and of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God which they haue vſed; and therefore haue thought that they haue had good cauſe to ſequeſter themſelues from being preſent at the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, which is performed by them; and thus they obiect againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:16851:125"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Another ſort haue thought all ſet formes of prayer are to be diſliked,<note place="margin">How others are withholden.</note> and ſuch onely to be allowed and offered vp to God, as by extemporarie gift are conceiued and vttered according to euery ones neceſſitie: which opinion is alſo to be reformed: Of both which I will ſay ſomewhat being obiections, though otherwiſe it bee beſides my purpoſe to diſcourſe of them at large. This I ſay, as I haue taken in hand, that publike prayer, as hath been ſaid of preaching and Sacraments, is a great helpe to godlines, to all ſuch as haue any meaſure of true godlines: or elſe it is long of themſelues, who, through the ignorance and darknes that is in them, doe not know, that they ought <hi>to pray alwaies with all manner ſupplications and giuing of thankes</hi>; and therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> publikely as well as priuately, when many hearts are powred out to God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then few, or one alone: or if they know this, their ſinne is the greater, in that they reſiſt and ſpurne againſt it.</p>
               <p>For to fortifie this that I ſay, to the firſt obiection I anſwere;<note place="margin">Anſwere to the firſt obiection.</note> although it be not to bee denied, but that the example of ignorant and vnreformed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially notorious perſons in the Miniſterie hath done, and doth much harme; yet if either they cannot be conuicted, or if their crimes be ſuch, as cannot remoue them out of their places; there is iuſt cauſe of griefe, that ſuch ſhould haue any thing to doe in Gods matters, which are ſo weightie and to be dealt in with al high reuerence: Yet, if this burden muſt be borne, I aske, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> among many ſweete liberties which we inioy, wee may not ioyne in prayer with them, if wee can pray in faith, ſeeing their vnworthines cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the fruite of Gods promiſe from vs, which is to one kind of prayer as well as to another, <hi>aske and ye ſhall receiue, that your ioy may be full.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 16.24.</note> And as it is farre from me to be a patrone of ſuch, or to iuſtifie them: ſo yet, while wee may inioy the miniſterie of better, I would not refuſe to bee partaker of the prayers which are offered vp by them. Who can blame him, who deſireth to pray with better then they be? and yet better to ioyne with them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, then to leaue the aſſemblies publike altogether.</p>
               <p>Concerning the next obiection,<note place="margin">Anſwere to the ſecond.</note> that though the miniſters be not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as the former, yet they ſhould vſe no ſet forme of prayer, but as they are moued by Gods ſpirit: I anſwere, it is a fond error ſo to thinke. For as there be neceſſarie things to be prayed for, of all men, and alwaies, and thoſe are the moſt things which we are to pray to the Lord for: ſo there may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript formes of prayer made concerning all ſuch things. Which being ſo, what letteth that in the reading of ſuch formes either of confeſſion of ſinnes, requeſt, or thankſgiuing; what letteth (I ſay) that the hearers hearts may not profitably goe with the ſame, both to humble, to quicken, and to comfort? For is the reading it ſelfe vnpure, when the miniſter in his owne behalfe and the peoples, vttereth them to God? I ſpeake not (ye ſee) of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> matter of prayer, but of reading it: for if the matter be erroneous and naught, the pronouncing of it maketh it not good, any more then the reading doth: if it be good and pure, being vttered or pronounced, the reading cannot hurt it or make it euil. And as the Church in the Scripture did and doth now ſing Pſalmes vpon a booke to God, and yet though it vtter a preſcript forme of words, I hope none will ſay, that it is a ſinne to doe ſo, the heart being prepared: in like manner, to follow a preſcript forme of words in praying,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:16851:126"/>
is no ſinne: and therefore ought not to be offenſiue to any.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, how can men repeate the ſame forme of words daily, as they doe in the reading of publike prayer, but it muſt needes be coldly done, and ſo abhominable to God? I anſwere, it is not the oft praying for the ſame things, that maketh it odious to God, but when it is done with an vnreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, vnprepared, and corrupt heart; for cuſtome, not feruently and in faith. And further to ſatisfie them, they may know that in all Churches, and the beſt reformed that they would alleage, there is a preſcript forme of prayer vſed: and therefore they who are of minde, that it ought not to be, muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelues from all Churches. Alſo if a ſet forme of prayer were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, then neither were the Lords prayer (which is a ſet forme of prayer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> preſcribed by our Sauiour himſelfe) to be vſed. Which yet though it bee ſometime to be vſed in the forme wherein it is ſet downe: yet ſpeaking of it by this occaſion, I thinke it not amiſſe to adde this one thing. That though our Sauiour tied vs to the matter of this prayer, as being perfect and full: yet he tied vs not to the words themſelues, ſeeing wee cannot either thinke on, remember, or deſire at one inſtant, all the particulars contained in the ſame. And beſides, we by crauing particularly the things which we ſtand in neede of, are more ſtirred vp and moued.</p>
               <p>But theſe thus anſwered, I will proceede, perſwading all good Chriſtians to lay aſide contention, and endles, and (many of them alſo) needles que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> about this matter: And to reſolue with themſelues, ſeeing it muſt of al, who are well aduiſed, bee graunted, that the publike prayers are an helpe to ſtirre vp Gods graces in vs, and to conuey to vs the many good bleſſings of God which wee want, beſide other notable effects: therefore, to looke to themſelues euery way ſo carefully, that they may euer keepe themſelues fit to be helped and benefited by them, and with the ſame well ordered hearts and minds to attend vnto, and applie to themſelues the prayers which either before and after the Sermon are vttered, or the other, which through the whole action of Gods worſhip are read in their hearing: And not to be led by opinion, that they can take no profit by them; nor as the common ſort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> doe, who after long going to Church, doe prooue too truly, that they haue taken no good by them, being not indeede able to ſhew how they ſhould pray,<note place="margin">The booke of Common prayer in the Letanie, and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> or behaue themſelues in that action. But ſeeing they haue libertie to heare Gods word preached where they may moſt commodiouſly inioy it, (for ſo they are willed not onely themſelues, but to call vpon their children to heare Sermons, and the Miniſters are vrged as well by their preaching, as by their liuing, to giue good example) therefore to take their part in both, with cheerefulnes and thankſgiuing: And in ſinging of Pſalmes, ſuch as can not reade, ſhould attend to them who are neereſt them in the congregation, that they may ioyne with them, and conſent to the action of praiſing God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> with the reſt of the aſſemblie; and not to gaze, and toſſe vaine imaginations and phantaſies, where they ſhould <hi>lift vp pure hearts and hands</hi> to God. And as for ſuch as refuſe to come to take part in the worſhip of God, altogether, as the Browniſts and ſuch like, let them beare their ſhame before men, and their peace ſhall be ſmall to Godward, while they ſit at home with their owne bare reading for their diet, who ſcorne the beſt liberties of the word
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16851:126"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> preached, prayer, and the Sacraments in the publike aſſemblies. For ſo I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand they doe, as well otherwaies, as by the confeſſion of themſelues, and that before the Magiſtrate, examining what they did while, by the whole moneth and quarter, they abſented themſelues from the publike meetings: anſwere was made by the examinate, they ſate at home and read by themſelues. Let all iudge by what ſpirit ſuch are led and guided.</p>
               <p>Now hauing deſcribed and ſhewed the nature and vſe of the publike meanes,<note place="margin">Neceſſitie of priuate helpes.</note> I thinke it needfull before I doe more particularly enter into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the priuate, to ſay ſomewhat of the neceſſitie of them, as well as of the publike. For that thouſands of the profeſſors,<note place="margin">The priuate helpes in little acquaintance with men. And that alſo with ſome of the godly.</note> and of them which are of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the viſible Church (amongſt whom wee muſt hope that God hath many of his elect) are little acquainted with the priuate, but doe thinke it needles for them to hearken after the ſame. And beſides, ſome of the deare children of God for want of ordinarie teaching, haue little vſe of them: and therefore it is much the worſe with them.</p>
               <p>For theſe cauſes therefore, and ſuch like, this is to be knowne and holden in firme perſwaſion, that the priuate are (in ſome ſort) as needfull as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: for they may be vſed at all times, whereas the publike cannot; as in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. For it being of neceſſitie that as our bodies, ſo our ſoules ſhould haue ſome daily refreſhing: therefore ſeeing the publike cannot daily bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> had, we muſt vſe priuate, as I ſaid before: and therefore they are both autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed and commaunded by one God. And the publike are but a part of the helpes, which God hath prouided for the profiting of his Church: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without the priuate, they doe the leſſe profit.</p>
               <p>For mens comming to Church (beſides which a great number know no other ſeruing of God) cannot doe that good to the beſt Chriſtians,<note place="margin">The publike without the priuate, cold.</note> which is to be looked for, if it bee not accompanied with theſe: as may bee ſeene in euery part of the publike worſhip of God. For hearing of the word read and preached, doth little profit, where it is not ioyned with preparation to heare reuerently and attentiuely, and where it is not muſed on after, yea and as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſhall offer, conferred of alſo: and if reading priuately (where it may be inioyed) be not vſed; what is more manifeſt then this, that almoſt al in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation doe by and by forget that which they haue heard, and make little vſe of it in their liues? And what greater cauſe can be rendred hereof then this, that they neuer looke after matters concerning their ſoules, when they are about their priuate dealings, and (as we ſay) out of the Church?</p>
               <p>Euen ſo, what vſe doe ſuch make of the Lords Supper? who (for the moſt part) beſides that they cannot tell how to prepare themſelues to it; ſo if ſome Miniſters, more carefull ouer the peoples ſoules, then others, doe teach and examine them about the knowledge they haue, yet cannot they be brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to trie themſelues indeede, in what true faith and vnfained repentance they come: ſeeing they are not wont, through the whole quarter before their receiuing, to beate their braines, or trouble themſelues about ſuch matters: Whereby it may be gathered for certaintie, that whatſoeuer the Scriptures ſpeake in the commendation therof, they be in little account and reckoning with them. And if they doe not priuately before the receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nouriſh theſe good graces of God in themſelues very carefully (for I
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16851:127"/>
ſpeake euen of the better ſort of Chriſtians, as well as of others) who ſeeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> not, that they ſhall haue much adoe, to bring their hearts, willingly to ſift themſelues, and to ſeeke for thoſe gifts at that time?</p>
               <p>So to ſay the ſame of the publike hearing of prayer in the aſſemblie, it is not onely to bee doubted, that they pray there in hypocriſie, <hi>drawing neere to God with their mouthes, their hearts being farre from him,</hi> if they doe neglect to pray alone, and ſecretly to God, and in their familie: but alſo the publike prayer groweth common with them, that is, weariſome, a bare ceremonie, and for faſhion (ſo farre is it off, that they be eaſed and comforted by it) as I can prooue by too ſure experience at this day, in ſuch as haue not learned to make conſcience of priuate prayer, but doe ſeparate the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">No excuſe for neglecting pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate helps.</note>And by this which I haue ſaid, it may appeare how neceſſarie it is, that the priuate helpes ſhould be vſed of al ſuch as haue their part in the publike. And beſides, as our neceſſities doe require it, ſo the Lord commanding the ſame, he hath giuen time and libertie from our other buſines and duties either in familie or otherwiſe, to vſe holily and continue the ſame: So that our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affaires ought to giue place to them, which through ignorance many count ridiculous, and fooliſh; and others, though they will not ſpeake ſo groſſely, yet being giuen ouer to the world ſo griplie, will put aſide little, or no buſines for the ſeruing of God. Although it is manifeſt, that where God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> is moſt purely, and beſt ſerued, their other buſines, as theſe earthly, haue beſt ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe few lines I thought good (before further diſcourſing of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate helpes) to ſet downe, that they which vſe them conſcionably, may not thinke that they doe any more then they ought, and haue neede of: they who vſe them but ſlackly and coldly, may beſtowe greater diligence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that amongſt all ſorts they may bee had in better regarde, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee good dayes here vpon earth.</p>

Which I obſerue, becauſe many good Chriſtians not hauing well weighed it, doe thinke it very much they ſhould diligently ſtand vpon their watch, as thinking that it depriueth them of much ſweete libertie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe, as they thinke, with good reaſon diſlike and refuſe to be guided by that doctrine: although with little good aduice, as they who will not bee contentious, may eaſily ſee, by that which hath been ſaid about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>And for mine owne part, I thanke God, I can ſay, that many godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in my knowledge, haue reaſoned againſt the carefull vſe of it, when they heard it firſt vrged, &amp; before they had experience of it (for they thought it very much, that all which they had done in raſhnes, haſte, and without good aduice (as their whole life had been little better) ſhould be brought in queſtion:) and yet ſince, they hauing found the fruite of it ſo ſweet, and the gaine ſo great, after better aduice, they would in no wiſe forgoe it againe, and be let looſe to their former raſhnes and ſecuritie. So I doubt not, but that many, to whom God hath giuen ſome taſte and ſauour in heauenly things,<note place="margin">VVatchfulnes is counted too ſtrict, till men be wel acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it.</note> for want of experience may at firſt, thinke the vrging of this watching, to be ouer ſtrict; yet after further inſight into it, as both commaunded vs of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and it ſelfe of ſingular gaine, they ſhall ſee their errour, and rather pray moſt earneſtly to haue their part in it, then to hold their former iudgement. I ſpeake not, as though any which feare God were meere ſtraungers to this grace and gift of God (for I know they are not without it ſometimes) but for that either in their iudgement they are not reſolued, that it ought to be in vſe with them from time to time, that is to ſay, one time as well as another: or if they be, yet they haue too much neglected it.</p>
               <p>As for them which obiect, that they cannot be ſo mortified as ſome are,<note place="margin">The anſwere to them who ſay, they cannot watch.</note> nor bee alwaies obſeruing themſelues as ſome doe, contenting themſelues with that which they haue, I ſay, it is a ſpeech much vnbeſeeming Chriſtians, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> who are to profeſſe growing forward to more watchfulnes, as to all other kinds of grace. And yet I count their caſe better then theirs, who thinke they can ſerue God (they hope) without all this adoe: For they indeede beare themſelues in hand, that whiles in ſome generall ſort they pray at ſome time, and goe to Church, they neede not greatly examine their other behauiour beſide, or take heed vnto the ſame. Let all ſuch pleaſe themſelues as they liſt, ſure it is, they reſiſt God: and greatly to be lamented it is, that men being profeſſors of the Goſpell, ſhould haue ſo little vſe of this ſo gracious a helpe, ſo often preached vnto them.</p>
               <p>But to let them goe, ſee thou, whoſoeuer thou art, who deſireſt to walke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with God in peace, that thou circumſpectly looke vnto thy ſteps, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall affections of thy heart, what and how thou carrieſt thy ſelfe, as I haue ſhewed, how thou oughteſt to endeuour thy ſelfe to <hi>watch in all things.</hi> And this is the rather to be marked and learned, becauſe it lendeth helpe to all the other rules which hereafter follow, for directing thee in al the actions of the day, as I haue ſaid: Becauſe (as it followeth) neither in company with others,<note place="margin">VVe muſt watch in the particular parts of our life.</note> nor alone by thy ſelfe canſt thou pleaſe God, nor in proſperitie nor aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,

If we go about any euill thing, we haue reaſon and ſtrength of perſwaſion from the pleaſure and profit to goe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> through with it, and to ſee no danger that accompanieth it, but to extenuate it,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.</note> and not <hi>to looke to the end,</hi> as we ought to doe: but all ſound reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs is weake, the diuel ſhewing himſelfe at ſuch times as a tempter, who yet will afterward come to vs as an accuſer, when we ſhould repent.</p>

               <p>And what cauſe there is to vrge this part of Chriſtian dutie of continuall watching, we may ſee by the example of our grandmother <hi>Eue,</hi>

The like we may ſee by the example of king <hi>Dauid,</hi> whom though the Scripture doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> renowne with as great commendation for his meditating in the law of God, as any man: yet for that he was not armed with a watchfull heart at that one time <hi>when he walked on the roofe of his palace</hi>;<note place="margin">2.

The experience that I haue gathered, ſince I began to looke more aduiſedly into this thing, I meane into the neceſſitie and benefit of a watchfull courſe, which hath bin long enough to teach and aduiſe both my ſelfe and others vpon ſo long a triall (well nigh theſe thirtie yeeres in ſome manner as I haue been able) this experience (I ſay) doth make me the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and earneſter in it, to perſwade ſuch as haue truly imbraced the Goſpell,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16851:130"/>
that they would adioyne herewith this godly watch, a ſpeciall nouriſher and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſtrengthner of their faith, to ſettle themſelues therein whatſoeuer they goe about, or take in hand: as that their talke be not idle and frothie, but <hi>ſauourie and poudred with ſalt</hi>; that their actions be ſuch, as they may defend with peace of conſcience againſt their accuſers; and that they labour <hi>to ſuppreſſe, and to bring into ſubiection euen their wicked thoughts and deſires,</hi> and weaken euen the bodie of ſinne it ſelfe, I meane <hi>the old man with his luſts.</hi> For behold and this know, that euen amongſt thoſe who reioyce in the teſtimonie of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſuch doe alwaies honour the Goſpell moſt; moſt ſtop the mouth of the gainſayer, and doe carrie themſelues moſt conſtantly and continually in an euen and good courſe, ſo farre as they haue knowledge, who haue been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> wiſe this way,<note place="margin">Other gifts much beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by this: and contrarie.</note> and who haue determined with themſelues to ſtand vpon their watch from time to time. And on the other ſide, ſuch as in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many good things may be ſeene (I ſpeake both of teachers &amp; hearers) and are for ſundrie cauſes much to bee accounted of; yet being noted for raſh and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaied in their actions, and not ſo much looking to themſelues, by wiſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of themſelues, haue done the leſſe good to others by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and haue cauſed the other gifts which they haue to be the leſſe regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. God be gloried for the good that is done by this in many: but if it were more commonly imbraced and taken vp of many moe, who for knowledge are able to ſeaſon and giue light to numbers, they ſhould not be moſt in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> who haue leaſt deſerued it, nor many pleaſe themſelues in a looſe and vnprofitable courſe, which beſide that, it withholdeth from them much ſound comfort, it is a ſore blemiſh in their liues. Yet this I thought good to adde, for as much as the Romiſh Church, eſpecially they who will ſeeme more deuout then the reſt,<note place="margin">The watchfull obſeruing of mens tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is farre off from this.</note> ſtand much vpon their diligent keeping of the cuſtomes of their mother Church, and the precepts of the ſame, who might therefore ſeeme to themſelues, and be thought of others to be before others in godlines: let all know, that this which I haue ſaid of watchfulnes, leaueth not the leaſt piece of commendation to them. For they watch to keepe the obſeruances of men; but watchfulnes muſt bee vſed for the obeying of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> commaundements of God: they ſuperſtitiouſlie watch to obſerue ſome houres and daies and times, wherein if they performe any thing in outward working, they thinke themſelues more holy then others, though other times be little regarded: but the watchfulnes which pleaſeth God, te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to euerie houre, day and time, as well one as another. And to ſpeak of their beſt watch which they keepe ouer their liues, yet from their owne words I conclude, that it cannot be allowed of God, becauſe it <hi>commeth not of faith,</hi> that is, of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the fauour of God, and conſequently that he will bleſſe it (for this faith, which they call the Proteſtants faith, they vtterly renounce) without which yet,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Now to grow to an end about this matter. It is further to be marked, that (becauſe true Chriſtians, &amp; the deareſt ſeruants of God do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of ſome eſpecial infirmities, wherewith they find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues more troubled then with any other) they muſt be more ſuſpitious of, and vigilant againſt them, then others. And becauſe the diuell doth more eaſily winde them into ſome ſins, then others (as he ſeeth their diſpoſition and inclination, and thereby the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16851:130"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> greater daunger they are in, by meanes thereof) therefore they are taught in wiſedome and experience to haue a more narrow eye ouer them, and more eſpecially to auoyde the very occaſions of them whereby they haue fallen. For example, put the caſe, that ſome are ſtrongly tempted to the ſinne of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannes, who being blindfolded about that which they deſire,<note place="margin">We muſt ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, which moſt anoyeth vs.</note> doe count it no offence, though they paſſe their bounds very greatly in wantonnes of eye, in libertie of ſpeech that way, or ſecret deſires, of though they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſnared therewith; yet hauing through long cuſtome nouriſhed their hearts in ſuch lothſome delights, and too faintly miſliked their offence when they ſaw it, haue brought themſelues into bondage to their luſts.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> In this therefore if there be not much occupying of the heart againſt this ſinne, to ſee into, and weigh the lothſomnes, ſhame and danger of it; how vnbeſeeming it is Gods ſeruants to be ſubiect to ſuch ſlauerie; if it be not acknowledged heartily to God, earneſt and daily prayers as occaſion ſhall be offered, ſent vp to God againſt it, with confidence both of pardon and power to mortifie and weaken it, with ſtrong and many reaſons to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and renounce it, and the occaſions of nouriſhing it wiſely and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully auoyded; euen this one ſin, though they ſhould neuer offend groſſely, would hold the conſcience in great vnquietnes, cauſe the parties to wander in deepe ſorrow, and make them vnfit to Chriſtian duties: yea if there be not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> more labour beſtowed there, then in other parts of the life, it will make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing to goe forward much the worſe, and in other actions of the life much confuſion to grow; and the longer they haue nouriſhed ſuch vaine dreames, the more hardly they ſhall awake out of them, euen when they gladly would. And that which I ſay of this one, I may as truely ſay of the reſt, if they haue been harboured. To this purpoſe, is that complaint of the people of Iſrael in their repentance and turning to God: wherein they declare that one ſinne did more trouble them, then ſome other.</p>
               <p>For thus they ſay in their confeſſion: <hi>We haue ſinned againſt thee, O Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 12.19.</note> 
                  <hi>but eſpecially in asking vs a king, beſides all our other ſinnes.</hi> And as it troubled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them moſt when they asked pardon of God; ſo it appeareth in the ſtorie, that of all other ſinnes they were moſt drawne by that to offend God: For when they would needes haue a King againſt the will of God,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 8.19.</note> and <hi>Samuel</hi> was ſent from God to tell them what a manner of one he ſhould be, if they would needes haue one contrarie to Gods mind; it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>that the people would not heare the voyce of</hi> Samuel, <hi>but anſwered, nay, but there ſhall be a King ouer vs, and we will be like all other nations.</hi> Therefore as their ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they did moſt offend God, put them to greateſt trouble: ſo muſt thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeciall ſinnes, which haue preuailed againſt Gods children, be moſt watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt and auoyded.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And is there not great reaſon in it, foraſmuch as they haue moſt diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, that they ſhould bend the moſt force of their ſtrength againſt them? Euen as if ſome one troubleſome perſon in a towne ſhould diſquiet the whole, all would lay their helpe together to remoue and keepe him out;<note place="margin">An illuſtrating it by ſimilies.</note> And as in an houſe which hath many and great commodities, and yet ſome one ſore annoyance, as a principal chimney caſting ſmoke, with great ſpeede that ſhall be redreſſed, more then other things, which yet are to be regarded
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:16851:131"/>
likewiſe: ſo in the life of ſound Chriſtians, wherein many good bleſſings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of God may bee reaped and inioyed, the chiefe ruines are to be chiefely looked vnto, although the meaner are not to be neglected. And great labour muſt bee taken about it, and watching againſt that ſinne, which moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth in vs; and much more, then againſt ſome other, by which there is leſſe danger to be feared.</p>
               <p>And this helpe (as I haue declared how) if it be vſed, and the meanes faithfully practiſed from time to time,<note place="margin">The fruite of ſuch watching.</note> let no doubt be made (ſeeing God hath promiſed ſucceſſe thereby, euen greater grace in the vſe thereof, then the ſin ſhall be able to reſiſt) let no doubt (I ſay) be made, but that they ſhall maiſter it, ſo farre, as it ſhall bring peace; vnleſſe it be the caſe of vnmarryed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> perſons, to whom God hath appointed marriage for a lawfull remedie, when by none of the forementioned, or the like meanes, the gift of continencie can no longer be enioyed.</p>
               <p>This aduiſe how vnſauorie and vnwelcome ſoeuer it be to ſuch as are wedded to their luſts, and will offer no violence to them: yet ſuch as know the ſmart that is raiſed by this ſinne, and that ſometime the deere ſeruants of God haue been deceiued by it, will be glad to bee directed and helped againſt it. And that which I haue ſaid of this, I may ſay of pride, worldlines, anger, malice, reuenge, vniuſt dealing and lying, that as euery man is more eaſily ouercome of, or hurt by them, more then of other ſinnes; ſo hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſhould haue a more continuall feare of them, watchfulnes againſt them, and beſtow more time in ſeeking the rooting out of them: that ſo the wealth and ſafetie of the whole life may be preſerued, when ſuch noyſome ſores, as did moſt of all impaire the ſame, be cured.</p>
               <p>But if men be either ignorant of this dutie, or cannot be perſwaded to ſet themſelues to the entertaining of it, and to get acquaintance with it, they muſt looke to liue deſtitute of a chiefe part of godlines; or if it be but now and then in ſome eſpeciall actions and parts of our life, regarded and looked vnto (as it is done of them who are not greatly experienced in the practiſe of Chriſtianitie) it will make the godly life in great part to be bereaued both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of her gaine and beautie.</p>
               <p>Our hearts muſt not range where they liſt, nor our delights bee faſtned where we pleaſe; but our eyes, our tongues, our eares, hands, feete, and the whole powers of our mindes,<note place="margin">If we be but turned out of the way, we muſt ſpeedily returne. <hi>Phil. 2.12.

In ſo much, that if we ſee, we haue but broken out of our conſtant courſe a little, &amp; that our conſciences begin to checke vs, we ſhould <hi>tremble</hi> to thinke what we haue done: and <hi>feare alwayes</hi> for the time to come, leaſt we ſhould offend. We muſt watch when we are well, to keepe well: and when we haue been deceiued, to returne ſpeedily againe: we muſt watch in trouble, againſt triefnes and impatience: in proſperitie, againſt wantonnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and lightnes, Iob. 31.1. If we could frame to this, we ſhould doe well enough, as he that looketh to his foote in a ſlippery place, ſhall not be hurt. And if we may by watching ouer our ſelues, haue our whole life in ſafety, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; are we not worthie to ſmarte, if we cannot doe ſo much for ſo great a benefit? Therefore, moſt worthily doe ſuch ſuffer hardnes and ſorrow, who will in no wiſe be brought to take heede to their waies; but cry out, that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16851:131"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it is preciſenes and a kinde of death vnto them, to be reſtrained from their noyſome and dangerous liberties: From whence ariſeth boldnes and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, which cannot want much ſinne.

Thus much for the more plaine and full handling of this firſt priuate helpe, called watchfulnes.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow followeth the ſecond, which is Meditation:<note place="margin">VVhat it is.</note> And that is when we doe of purpoſe, ſeparate our ſelues from all other things, and conſider as we are able, and thinke of ſome poynts of inſtruction neceſſarie to leade vs forward to the kingdome of heauen, and the better ſtrengthening of vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the diuel and this preſent euill world, and to the wel ordering of our liues. I ſay of purpoſe, ſeeing we both muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> minde ſuch things in good aduiſednes, and ſet our ſelues about them reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, when we take them in hand; that they may be done with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and profit: and alſo ſeeing it falleth out for the moſt part, that we ſeldome enter into meditation of heauenly things, when we doe not intend them, but are ledde by the obiects of our mindes, eyes, or eares an hundred waies amiſſe, or if any good thought ariſe, it is repelled by and by, and goeth no further. To proceede I ſay, that when we meditate, we ought to ſeparate our ſelues from all company and troubleſome occaſions,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> as our Sauiour commaundeth vs to doe, <hi>when we pray priuately</hi> (theſe two being compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) as in our chamber priuatly, or in the field, or ſome commodious place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that we may the better performe it: the ſmalleſt occaſions ſoone breaking vs off from ſuch ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>And I ſay laſtly, that we muſt there ſet our minds on worke, about the cogitation of things heauenly, by calling to remembrance ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them which we knowe: and ſo debate and reaſon about the ſame, that our affections may thereby be moued to loue and delight in, or to hate and feare, according to that which we meditate on; ſo that we may make ſome good vſe of it to ourſelues. And this ſpirituall exerciſe of meditation is euen that which putteth life and ſtrength into all other duties, and parts of Gods worſhip. And this the holy Ghoſt reporteth of <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Patriarke,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 24.63.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  <hi>that he went out into the field toward the euening to meditate.</hi> Which had not been commendable, if he had not vſed ſo to doe (ſeeing it is the right kinde of ſuch holy duties to be oft in vſe) being taught of his father <hi>Abraham,</hi> who <hi>was the friend of God,</hi> and very familiar with him, and therefore (we may be ſure) had much communion and talke with him. As alſo our father <hi>Enoch</hi> did, who for proofe hereof, is ſaid in his whole life, <hi>to haue walked with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this are all ſuch as deſire to take any good by it, to know: that they
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:16851:132"/>
muſt be acquainted throughly with this ſweete and heauenly communing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> with the Lord and themſelues, which was called of the Fathers of ancient time, their Soliloquie, that is, the talke which they vſed to haue alone by themſelues: That as men wearied, deſire reſt; ſo wee by the varietie and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicitie of buſines in this world, being troubled and diſtracted, may ſeeke eaſe to our mindes by meditation.</p>
               <p>For otherwiſe wee may muſe and thinke vpon any good things, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our words and actions which wee doe, to ſee them done aright: which yet is not this kind of meditation that I now ſpeake of, but that watchfulnes mentioned before; which is a warie regarding, and taking heede to our waies, in one thing after another. Which yet the Prophet calleth meditation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> alſo:<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.97. Ioſh. 1.8.</note> as where he ſaith, <hi>All the day long doe I meditate on thy word:</hi> and in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua; Thou ſhalt meditate day and night on the booke of the law:</hi> which wee know, could not be vnderſtood of meditation by intermiſſion of companie, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions, and buſines, but in their whole courſe a circumſpect care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they might bee done after the word. And the matter of this our meditation,<note place="margin">The matter of meditation.</note> may be of any part of Gods word: on God himſelfe, his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power; his mercie, or of the infinite varietie of good things which wee receiue of his free bountie; alſo of his workes and iudgements: or on our eſtate, as our ſinnes, and the vilenes of our corruption, that wee yet carrie about vs, our mortalitie, of the changes in this world, or of our deliuerance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> from ſinne, and death: of the manifold afflictions of this life, and how wee may in beſt manner beare and goe through them, and the benefit thereof, and the manifold and great priuiledges which wee inioy daily through the ineſtimable kindnes of God toward vs: but ſpecially of thoſe things which we haue moſt ſpeciall neede of.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like are the matter of our meditation, and as oft as we goe aſide to thinke with purpoſe and deſire of heart vpon theſe things, or any of them, for the better calling of our mindes out of the world, then we are ſaid to meditate: ſo when in or about any of theſe, we ſigh, moane, complaine to God, or reioyce, and are quickened in our hearts by ſuch occaſions, euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that alſo is meditation, and moſt commonly ioyned with prayer. Of which two holie exerciſes the booke of the Pſalmes is full, namely that 119. Pſalme: where the man of God ſetteth downe his meditations, which he had in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſtate of his: as either lamentation, complaints, or ſupplications in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; or ioy and thankes for deliuerances and proſperitie.</p>
               <p>By this vnderſtand, what manner of exerciſe meditation is: Euen ſuch an exerciſe it is, which is required of thee from time to time (as may be conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient) through thy life, that by recording holie and diuine things, eſpecially thoſe which may make thee ſound in the matter of thy ſaluation, a little time (when thou maiſt beſt) may bee beſtowed of thee to drie vp thy fleſhly and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> bad humours of earthly mindednes and worldlines, &amp;c. or to quicken thy dull heart, leaſt after thy ſleepe in ſinne, the diuell maketh thee forget thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer well ordrednes. And becauſe I am too ſure that few are acquainted with it, though it bee an helpe moſt profitable to godlines, I will ſomewhat more at large ſpeake of it, that the practiſe of it may be more common: and that they which vſe it with the other helps, may much more cheerefully go
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:16851:132"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> through their courſe.<note place="margin">The neceſſitie of meditation.</note> How neceſſarie this heauenly exerciſe and recourſe to God is, may eaſily be conceiued, for that the hearts euen of good Chriſtians are ſo ſeaſoned with vnſauourie thoughts, deſires, and delights of follie, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and much other naughtines (ſeeing the beſt are chaunged and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med but in part) that they thinke it vtterly impoſſible to bring them to any better point; and therefore many by this errour doe not greatly goe about it: yet if ſuch noiſome poyſons be ſuffered to lurke and remaine in them, we know, they doe not onely, as ſowre weedes choake the plants of grace in them, but alſo grow vp, and bring forth moſt noiſome and dangerous fruits, as by wofull experience men feele and trie.</p>
               <p>

I ſay there is no helpe more auaileable to hunt and purge them out, becauſe although by the word we know them, by conference we doe reuiue the remembrance of them, and by reading we doe both: yet all <hi>theſe runne out of our riuen heads,</hi>

               <p>Now when we ſee ſo farre into the danger of them, and be wearied with the noiſomnes of them, that we will tie our ſelues oft to gage theſe hearts of ours, to ſift our thoughts, to accuſe and condemne them,<note place="margin">Meditation purgeth out ſin.</note> as we find cauſe by the filthines and ſhame of them, and herein will deale truly, as we loue our ſoules: then doe wee begin to breake the knot of ſuch curſed ſwarmes, and to chaſe away the lurking litter of prophane thoughts and deſires out of our hearts; then we waxe more watchful againſt them after, and make more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of them, adioyning thereto, inward and earneſt requeſts to God for aſſiſtance and bleſſing: Then alſo we ſhall furniſh our hearts more gratiouſly with heauenly cogitations and holy deſires: all which make greatly for the well paſſing of our daies. Therfore no man that will weigh how great things are wrought in our hearts, by holie meditating vpon our eſtate, and vpon Gods bountifulnes towards vs, namely, euen a framing of vs after the image of God, ſhall neede to doubt how neceſſarie it is.</p>
               <p>And ſo much the more wee are to thinke it, becauſe it is well knowne by Scripture, and tried by experience, that <hi>our hearts are deceitfull aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:</hi> and thereby we beare our ſelues in hand,<note place="margin">Our hearts are deceitfull.</note> that if wee doe once obtaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thus much of them, that wee can commend that which is good, and ſpeake againſt euill, we are readie to thinke our eſtate to be right marueilous good, when yet in the meane while,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28. Zach. 12.12.</note> if wee doe not finde our hearts in our ſecret meditations (and when wee ſearch our thoughts alone by our ſelues, how they ſtand affected) that we can feele vnfained hatred of euill to be in them, and loue to goodnes: wee doe but deceiue our ſelues. And in euery little triall, we ſhall finde it otherwiſe then wee would thinke: I meane, that ſinne
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16851:133"/>
ſitteth neerer and is faſter glued to vs, then wee did imagine.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               </p>
               <p>For as he which goeth to warre, is firſt trained and made fit to vſe his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon at home:<note place="margin">VVe muſt ſet againſt our ſinne in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before we can caſt it off in company.</note> and the ſcholler trieth maſteries priuately, before he come forth to diſpute openly: So a good Chriſtian will trie what he can doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his affections and ſinne, alone by himſelfe in his ſolitarie meditation, and reſolue againſt the ſame (accordingly as he ſeeth the difficultie thereof to require) before he can in his common dealings, with all ſortes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, be ſtrong from temptations and falles, and free from offence giuing in his words and deedes. And therefore on the contrarie, this is the cauſe, why ſo many bewray themſelues to be hypocrites before men, for that they haue no triall of the truth and ſimplicitie of their hearts alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> in iudging and proouing the vprightnes of them before God, and therefore haue not ſought ſtrength of him againſt their infirmities.</p>
               <p>Oh how doth this <hi>communing with the Lord in ſecret,</hi> and debating with our ſelues about our mortalitie and corruption, and of his fauour in vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; how (I ſay) doth this, as oyntment mollifie our hard hearts, and make them to relent, and doth relieue them pleaſantly with the ſweetnes of it? How doth this eſtraunging of our ſelues from worldly impediments, drawe vs into neare and heauenly communion with our God? How doth it make vs acquainted with the manifold rebellions of our nature? with our blindnes, ſecuritie, earthlines, and infinit other loathſome filthineſſes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> which neither wee our ſelues will take knowledge of, while we carry our ſelues in many things as good Chriſtians amongſt men; neither any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (but ſuch as doe know it) would euer thinke, that ſo much poyſon could be incloſed in ſo narrow a roome, as within the compaſſe of one ſilly man.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Other ſweete benefit of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</note>Oh the fruite and benefit, which by our meditation and priuate prayer we reape, is ſo great (the ſpirit of God changing our hearts thereby, from their daily courſe and cuſtom more and more, and bringing the heauenly life into more liking with vs, and making it more eaſie and ſweete, which with the men of the world is ſo yrkeſome and vnſauorie) that none can well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> expreſſe or conceiue it, but he which hath felt the ſame? For by it, God bringeth to paſſe, that the ſugred baites of earthly delights and tranſitorie pleaſures of the world (though Sathan kindleth an exceſſiue and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate loue of them in vs) become not deadly poiſon vnto vs, as they doe to many, the Lord teaching vs to ſee the painted vizor and deceiueable picture of them by looking into them throughly, that we may beware of them.</p>
               <p>And as the Scripture noteth, how the men of God, who are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended there for their pietie, as <hi>Moſes, Dauid, Paul,</hi> and others, were much taken vp of this exerciſe; ſo I dare boldly affirme, that the moſt godly of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> time, may thanke God much for their acquaintance with it, and much vſe of it: and others that are ſtrangers to it, how wiſe and forward ſoeuer they be in practiſe of Chriſtian dutie, ſhould be much more purged and cleanſed from euill, if with their other ſeruices of God, they were conuerſant in this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ioyned with their priuate prayers, and this ſecret talking with God, and with their owne hearts.</p>

And for the firſt two, how neceſſarie and profitable it is, I haue ſhewed; as alſo it will further appeare by that which followeth, of the lettes which doe hinder it, and the remedies againſt them.

And concerning the letters how many and great ſoeuer they be, before I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſpeake of them, I haue no doubt, notwithſtanding them, by Gods aſſiſtance to make the way ſo eaſie, and plaine to the true Chriſtian to meditation (in this treatiſe of and about it) that by the ſame, the difficulties and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which doe moſt trouble them, ſhall be remoued, or at leaſt weakned, that howſoeuer ſome take no profit by it, they ſhall haue the way ſhewed them in a few leaues, which they alſo may learne in a few weekes, to make good benefit of it, which otherwiſe they may (without helpe) be voyde of for many yeares.</p>
               <p>To ſay ſomewhat therefore of the impediments firſt,<note place="margin">The lets of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</note> which hold Gods people ſtrangers from the vſe of meditation with profit, they are of two ſorts: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> For either they are ſuch as hinder them altogether from going about, or entring into it; or elſe they keepe them from taking any good thereby, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſet apart all other things of purpoſe, that they may giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (for the time) wholy thereto. Of the former ſort, there are three:<note place="margin">The firſt let and the remedie thereof.</note> The firſt is, when a Chriſtian knowing this dutie to be required of him, goeth about it, either in the morning (as I here perſwade, if it may be) or at any other conuenient time, but he hath no matter in readines to meditate vpon: he is emptie, barren, and vtterly to ſeeke about what to beſtowe the time,<note place="margin">VVant of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and his cogitations: for although he hath heard many things in ſermons, and wanteth many graces, which might driue him the rather to meditation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the better to come by them, and carrieth about many corruptions, and hath receiued many bleſſings and mercies from God; yet the diuell holdeth him, as it were blinde, forgetfull, and his minde confounded (it being oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied and taken vp vſually other waies amiſſe) ſo that he can finde nothing to muſe or conſider vpon, whereby he might ſeaſon his heart.</p>
               <p>Which when he ſeeth, and thereby that he cannot proceede in the dutie which he hath been taught to performe, and deſireth alſo to doe the ſame:
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16851:134"/>
he is exceedingly diſcouraged, made heauie hearted, and thereby the more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> hardly perſwaded to goe about it any more, but vnable to aske the way to redreſſe the ſame. For they who are ſo ſnared and ouermatched by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, can hardly ſeeke remedy, if any thing be amiſſe with them, but leaue of altogether from the good, in the which they perceiue themſelues to be ſtopped: which is cleane contrarie to the practiſe of the children of this world, who are ſo wiſe in their kind, that if they be diſappointed and broken off,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.2.3.</note> from their purpoſe one way, they will ſeeke the accompliſhment of their deſire many other waies, rather then to be fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>Now againſt this Let, I haue ſet downe hereafter in this treatiſe a way to remedy it: vnto the which I referre the reader; that is to ſay, certaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> rules to helpe him to meditate, and examples alſo to ſet him on worke: yet leaſt euery weake Chriſtian ſhould not be able ſufficiently to direct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, this I adde further and more particularly, that it ſhall be expedient for him, principally to propound to himſelfe, as he is able theſe foure things (till he ſhall be better able) to helpe himſelfe, to muſe of them. Firſt, of his vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, vilenes, and other his ſeuerall corruptions, and ſinnes. Secondly, of the greatnes of Gods bountie in forgiuing ſo many, and ſubduing daily more and more the dominion of ſinne and Sathan in him. Thirdly, he is to thinke how he may be guided through that preſent day, after the rules of his daily direction, eſpecially thoſe that ſeeme hardeſt to be followed, both the well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ordering of the heart, and framing his life, ſo farre as they agree with Gods word. Fourthly, let him meditate on the ſeuerall parts of the Chriſtian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, how God hath appointed to ſtrengthen him thereby, and by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helps, which I ſet downe to be vſed daily, for his better going forward, and how ſweete his life ſhall be by theſe helps in many reſpects more, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it can poſſibly be, and how to watch againſt all lets which may ariſe to hinder him from this courſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe or ſo many of them as he may conueniently, when he goeth about it, if he hath no other thing more neceſſarie, and in the beſt manner that he can be directed (through the counſell of any who is able) theſe (I ſay) are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> an eſpeciall remedie to helpe him, who for want of matter to meditate on, ſhould neglect or omit it; and for varietie, thoſe meditations which I ſhall ſet downe, ſhall helpe him forward alſo. For there is no true beleeuer (how weake ſoeuer he be) but he is fit (if he be willing) to follow this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond let, and the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereof.</note>The next impediment of the firſt ſort that hindereth a Chriſtian from meditating, is an vnfit minde vnto ſpiritual and heauenly duties, as when it being carried after other deſires, is ſlow and vnwilling to be occupied in cogitation or conſideration of any holy matters: and therefore letteth paſſe this meditation, as finding himſelfe vtterly vnable to enter into the ſame.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> He that knoweth, it ſhould be performed (it may be) is ſometime grieued for the omitting of it: but if the minde be impotent, as hauing loſt her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrength for the time, it is conſtrained to yeeld to the omitting of it. Now for the redreſſe of this, I anſwere, if he who omitteth it thus, through the vntowardnes of his heart, and vnfitnes to good duties, be ſuch an one as hath learned and reſolued to ſerue God euery day, he can the more hardly
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16851:134"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> beare this diſordrednes of the minde, and therefore he will ſeeke more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to haue it remedied: But if hee hath not yet obtained any ſuch gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelfe, but doth dutie to God more generally, ſeldome, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly, it muſt needes be the more hardly redreſſed: for it is manifeſt, that ſuch an one hath giuen his minde more libertie to wander in the world from the Chriſtian courſe.</p>
               <p>The remedie to both, as they can receiue it, is one and the ſame; although not to both alike eaſie: yet ſeeing they are both the Lords, let them bring their minds to theſe conſiderations, and ſay with themſelues, I haue <hi>receiued a minde to pleaſe God,</hi> to be teachable and readie to any dutie: I haue oppoſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> my ſelfe againſt mine owne will, and the diuels ſecret and malitious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, though ſweet to the fleſh: <hi>I am not a debter vnto it:</hi> how can I then yeeld to this vntowardnes of my heart, and ſo ſinne againſt my God? Where are the manifold and comfortable priuiledges, which hee hath giuen me, that I might bee faithfull to him? Am I wearie of my peace, and doe I haſte after mine owne ſorrow? Lord therefore bring backe this ranging heart of mine from the deceitfull dreames, or feares, or doubts that it hath been ſnared in: and <hi>reſtore it to the libertie which it was wont to inioy,</hi> that is, to ſolace it ſelfe in thy fauour, and communion with thee, and to count it my greateſt happines to commune with thee, when I may. And this gift being decaied, through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> mine owne fault, and Sathans crueltie and ſubtiltie, reſtore againe vnto me, and forgiue my weake loue towards thee, who haue prouoked thy maieſtie, (if thou wouldeſt bee prouoked) to frowne and looke amiablie on me no more.</p>
               <p>Thou Lord chargeſt me, thus to <hi>ſeeke thy face,</hi> euen thy ſweete preſence, which I haue gone from, and for a time been blinded, as hauing no abilitie to muſe of any good things, and haue not ſeene that I was ſeduced, till I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that I had loſt this ſweete libertie: now therefore (O Lord) ſhew thy louing kindnes in my diſtreſſe and weakenes, and reſtore to me this libertie of my minde, which many of thy children doe finde.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Thus fall into conſideration with thy ſelfe, and diſcourage not thy ſelfe, who haſt learned to vſe all thy wants to humble thee, and to bring thee nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to God, rather then to goe further from him: So that I conclude, that the remedie to ſuch a one, as through an vnſetled heart, cannot meditate of any parts of Chriſtianitie and godlines, hauing otherwiſe knowledge; yea the beſt remedie is to meditate of his preſent vnfitnes, looſenes of heart and earthly mindednes, to count it as an heauie burthen, to accuſe his heart, and ſo to bring it to relenting, by conſidering how farre off it is preſently from that mildnes, humblenes, heauenlines, and readines vnto dutie, which haue been in him at ſome other times. But let no man giue any libertie in any ſort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to his euill heart (when it is turned away from cheerefulnes and willingnes in any part of Gods ſeruice to goe forward therein) for that were to bring him into vtter bondage. And this for redreſſe of the ſecond let.</p>
               <p>The third followeth, and that is want of opportunitie, &amp; leaſure,<note place="margin">The third let, and the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die thereof.</note> by reaſon of neceſſarie buſines taking vp the time: vnto the which may bee added this, that there is no conuenient place to ſome, wherein they may goe apart from company, as the ſea-men, or ſuch as muſt go farre from their dwellings, when
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:16851:135"/>
they ſhould vſe it, as hauing neither choiſe of roome, and yet the ſame taken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> vp with children, and ſtirring vp and downe within, and compaſſed round with other houſes adioyning without, as in ſmall and poore families it is to be ſeene. To them which alleage that they are hindred by neceſſarie buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, I denie not, but ſuch may, and doe fall out ſometimes, eſpecially to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are occupied about many things:<note place="margin">Luk. 10.42.</note> whom I exhort, to weigh (as it behooueth all ſuch to whom this belongeth) that <hi>one thing is neceſſarie:</hi> and that the ordinarie workes of their callings are not to put this dutie out of place: for if they doe, it is by the vnskilfulnes, or vntowardnes of them who commit this fault: but the one of them is appointed of God to goe with the other, and both of them to ſtand together to the vpholding of their inward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> peace. And if they ſay, that their hindrance is not thereby, but by workes more then ordinarie, I further beſeech them by the mercifulnes of God, that they ſeeke not cloakes for their ſlouth; neither hold themſelues backe from ſo profitable duties, by occaſions of no great weight or importance, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for yeelding to the fleſh. I call thoſe buſineſſes, occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of great weight, when the omitting of them, although they be but houſehold, or worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; yet may trouble them more at that time, then the omitting of their meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which may be performed another time, but their buſineſſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: As it commeth oft to paſſe, that the neglecting of neceſſarie worke, through want of diſcretion, and heede taking, when it ſhould bee done (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in the meane while, prayer, reading, meditation, or ſuch like be gone about) troubleth the mind (I ſay) with ſo deepe griefe, through ſome great diſcommoditie ſuſtained, that in long ſpace it is not quiet and at libertie to ſerue God any way againe. And ſeeing God requireth to be honoured of vs in al things, euen in theſe earthly, as well as ſpirituall, therefore we muſt not think, it pleaſeth him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man ſhall through zeale without knowledge, doe that at one time, which ſhall quench zeale for want of wiſe heed taking, for many times after: but if any man will hereby let looſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bridle any thing the more to worldlines, let him know, that he hath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence no ſuch liberty.</p>
               <p>Now to returne, if any through neceſſarie lets ſhall be conſtrained to let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> paſſe this dutie of meditation, hereby let it appeare to haue been neceſſarie, and without his fault, if hee ſupplie this dutie after his neceſſarie labour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and take heede that in no wiſe it be omitted altogether, vnleſſe hee can be aſſured with peace, that God in the omitting of it hath been remembred ſome other way. And ſo I ſay of the hindrance, which commeth by want of conuenient place, that muſt be done which may moſt conueniently, ſeeing there is nothing gained by neglecting that dutie, in the doing whereof ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth our peace and welfare. And thus much of the lets which hinder alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from meditating about our eſtate, that wee may be the fitter thereby vnto prayer and good life.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
               </p>
               <p>The other lets are ſuch as hinder vs from the good and profitable vſe of it,<note place="margin">Two abuſes of meditation. The firſt, to vſe it ſleightly, and ſo to make a ceremonie of it.</note> when we breake through the three former, and theſe may rightly be called abuſes of it: and are two, which in few words I ſet downe thus. The firſt is a commonnes or cuſtomarines in it, when we through perſwaſion that it muſt be continued, doe it houerly and ſleightly, and ſo make a ceremonie of it, not ſo much looking how our hearts are well affected in and by it, as that we
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:16851:135"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> may not bee iuſtly charged for omitting it.<note place="margin">The remedie, we muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it is worthie to be delighted in.</note> Which ſinne is eaſily and ſoone committed in priuate prayer alſo, and ſuch like good exerciſes, when our mindes are not holden with a taking delight in them: and hereof it is, that all the ſeruing and worſhipping of God is with the moſt, but onely for faſhion: of all which it is ſaid by God in the Prophet; <hi>In vaine doe they worſhip me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſai. 29.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is when, although wee bee deſirous to vſe it,<note place="margin">The ſecond, when we be clogged and fraught with phantaſies and cares.</note> and that for our helpe and edifying, yet our heads are ſo full of trifling and wandring phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, or worldly matters, that wee cannot <hi>minde thoſe heauenly things,</hi> which are ſo contrarie to them: And from hence ariſeth a wearines of it, &amp; an haſtning to more libertie, that our hearts may raunge where they liſt, which is that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which they moſt of all deſire. And although through the very corruption of nature, the beſt of Gods children doe complaine, that they doe not the good they would, and therefore not this good ſometimes (notwithſtanding they miſlike that it ſhould bee ſo, and reſiſt it:) yet the eſpeciall cauſe of this vnſauourie, weariſome, and vntoward taking in hand, or ſetting vpon ſo holy and heauenly a part of Gods worſhip, is another beſides this: that is to ſay, the letting looſe of our hearts all the day (as I haue had occaſion to ſay in another place) diſordredly, without watching ouer them, and calling them backe from ſuch endleſſe rouings; that they may not forget God, but bee held within holie compaſſe, whereſoeuer we become, or whatſoeuer we goe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> about: for there muſt not be in vs <hi>at any time an euill heart.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 3.12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Euen this (I ſay) is the cauſe why we cannot haue our hearts at comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in meditation and prayer to attend vpon God reuerently, when we would. For when wee haue at our pleaſure giuen them ſcope through the day to faſten their liking where they haue deſire, it hath been hard for vs to weane them from it, when we would. And whiles we will be at this point, it will neuer bee better with vs in our meditation:<note place="margin">The remedie, we muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſet our ſelues againſt the corruption of our hearts.</note> no although God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the ſame to be an eſpeciall helpe to the well framing of our liues, and that our minds be brought into an heauenly eſtate thereby, if we would frequent it: yea although we appoint ſome eſpeciall time thereunto, yet ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> we be turned from muſing on good things to wandring, and ſhall hardly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten on any good matter, hauing yet certaine principall points concerning our eſtate to ſet vs on work therein; ſo many trifling phantaſies and dreames ſhall ſwimme in our braine to hold out better.</p>
               <p>And till theſe by little and little be dried vp with the flame of heauenly and feruent affections, vnſually poſſeſſing our hearts in ſtead of them, it will neuer be otherwiſe with vs but worſe and worſe. And it is a thing to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, that ſeeing none of our actions any day can be well done when our hearts are not good, and ſo preſerued and kept (which without circumſpect care and watch ouer them cannot be) it may be wondred at (I ſay) that wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhould yet bee ſecure and negligent about the keeping of them from ſuch daunger to our ſelues and others, as we know will thereby inſue.</p>
               <p>Therefore as the Lord by his Prophets hath cried out againſt the people in ſundrie ages, that <hi>they periſhed becauſe they would not vnderſtand,</hi>

                  </note> euen we whom God hath choſen out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> world; yet ſeeing <hi>we are ſtrangers here,</hi> we cannot neither may we place our hearts delight and felicitie here, but our chiefeſt comfort muſt be to haue daily communion with God, and to <hi>haue our conuerſation in heauen,</hi> with him, (vnto the which, meditation is a ſingular helpe) and what waightie matters ſoeuer we be buſied about, yet to <hi>remember our maker</hi> in them all, that he be pleaſed and truſted in of vs.</p>
               <p>And in that many, euen of Gods ſeruants doe (through their corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) loath this heauenly Manna (I meane to be oft and daily in muſing on the things which concerne their peace) and haue their teeth ſet on edge with the deceitfull pleaſures of worldly men,<note place="margin">Men loſe a great part of their ſweete and bleſſed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing here, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they will not vſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> who know no better: euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> this (I ſay) though there were no other thing, doth cauſe, that they inioy not the tenth part of the priuiledges and liberties which God hath proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them in this their pilgrimage. Neither can any thing (if it be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) be leſſe tolerable in the ſight of almightie God, then whereas he hath giuen vs his Scriptures, which tell vs his minde, and therefore teach vs how we may commune with his maieſtie, and for our behoofe, hath giuen vs an earneſt charge <hi>to ponder them in our heart, to haue them in minde, to make them the matter of our cogitation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming, that the weightieſt matters ſhould be ſlightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</note> 
                  <hi>delight, talke, and practiſe</hi>; yet that Chriſtians of good hope ſhould not be better acquainted with this heauenly courſe, nor be occupied thus, but by fittes, very ſeldome and coldly, as if God had been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> earneſt with vs about a trifle, or as though he had offered vs great iniurie to mooue vs thereunto.</p>
               <p>So that although I cannot ſay, it is no part of their thought, which ſhould ſeaſon all their thoughts (as I may ſay of many lying proteſtants, who doe ſhunne and flie all conſideration of heauenly matters, leaſt they ſhould trouble and diſquiet them:) yet it is too manifeſt that they ſauour too ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly of Gods preſence and companie; who ſhunne it, by being ſtrangers to this meditation, whereby they may haue fellowſhip and companie with him.</p>
               <p>Therefore to remedie this trifling out the time when we goe about to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> meditate and pray priuately, and to obtaine that we may be fit to performe this dutie,<note place="margin">The former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cleerely ſet downe.</note> and not bee carried at that time after wandring, wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue that which hindreth vs from it: I meane we muſt tie vp our looſe hearts throughout the daie from their deadly cuſtome of ranging after vaine, fond, and deceiuable thoughts, dreames and delights: we muſt weigh how little worth this is, to haue our cogitations faſtned vpon things tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, much leſſe about thoſe which are filthie, but rather bring them to be taken vp in thoſe which are heauenly. This we are called vnto: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we can learne to doe thus, that how weightie ſoeuer our dealings be, yet we count this the chiefeſt to keepe peace with God, and euer feare to offend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> him: it will be an hard matter to bring ourſelues to meditate, and pray with cheerefulnes and fruite.</p>
               <p>Now that I haue ſet downe the neceſſitie and profit of meditation, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we liſt to vſe it, and the eſpeciall lets thereof, I will now in that which followeth,<note place="margin">Rules and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, follow.</note> onely helpe the reader with ſome rules to guide himſelfe the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter herein, vntill it be more familiar vnto him (and then he ſhall vſe it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>If he cannot thus doe, let him reade before, ſome part of the hundred and nineteene Pſalme: ſome of the epiſtles of the Apoſtles: Chriſts ſermons,<note place="margin">4 Ioh. 14.15.16.</note> or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſome part of this direction, or ſome meditations, which follow, ſo many as conueniently he may, or any good matter fit for this purpoſe to ſeaſon &amp; wel affect his mind: that ſo he may learne how to performe this duty, and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp him ſelfe to it oft &amp; from time to time, when he once knoweth how. If he cannot reade, he muſt deſire more helpe of others: and for want of helpe, he muſt needes looke to goe the more ſlowly forward, either in the right, and kinde vſe of meditation, or in any part of ſound godlines, and Chriſtianitie: ſeeing we cannot be ignorant of this, that the old ſubtill fowler ſets his ſnares and nettes ſo thicke in our way, that we haue no ſhift, but to fall into them, and light vpon them, except with the winges of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and prayer wee mount vp on high aboue them, and flie ouer them.</p>
               <p>Now follow the examples or particular meditations, which I thought good to adioyne to that which hath been ſaid of this matter, to teach the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; and to helpe euen the ſtronger Chriſtians, when they be not ſo fit to helpe themſelues; and neuer out of ſeaſon or vnprofitable to either of both: I ſet ſome of them downe more briefly, that they may giue occaſion

               <p>A great difference there is, betwixt the continuall obſeruing and viewing of our life from day to day, and the doing of it by fits now and then: in the one we are ſafe, cheerefull, and fruitfull: in the other, raſh, offenſiue, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnquiet for it, walking in feare and with little comfort.</p>

               <p>When the Scripture telleth vs of the happineſſe of the Church, as Pſalm. 89.11. and 87.3. we may thinke we come ſhort very much, when we eſteeme not our eſtate better then the beſt of the world.</p>

               <p>We would willingly pleaſe our ſelues in ſome vnlawfull liberties, when we haue pleaſed God in ſome duties. But a wiſe man will keepe well, while <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> he is well, and not trouble himſelfe with an ill conſcience, when God doth not trouble him with hard afflictions, ſeeing it is written (Hebr. 3.12. and 1.

               <p>The more grace we perceiue in any man and conſtancie, and the more he is like to God, the better we ought to loue him, as Chriſt did <hi>Iohn,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, Ioh. 13.23. Pſal. 15.4.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The firſt point ſheweth what the armour is.</note>The whole <hi>complete armour</hi> therefore, is the ſpirituall furniture of the gifts and graces of the holie Ghoſt, by which, God doth deliuer his from all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie power, and bring them to the obedience of his will.

               <p>And although there are other points of armour ſet downe in other places of the Scripture, yet are they but parcels of this, or the ſame in other words expreſſed. Neither ſhall there neede any other: for he who is attired and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with this, ſhall not in any point be vnprouided, or to ſeeke of ſtrength in the time of neede. But yet doth not euery man ſee by and by how theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> may be accounted armour, therefore will I deſcribe them ſeuerally.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">VVhat ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is.</note>Sinceritie or vprightnes is that weapon of the ſpirituall warfare, and that fruit of the ſpirit which ſhould accompanie the whole conuerſation (not ſome few actions of a Chriſtian) by the which hee is ſimple and without fraud and hypocriſie bearing ſway in him, both towards God and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: and it may the more cleerely be diſcerned by conſidering the perſon in whom it is found, namely an vpright man, whom (in the deſcription of <hi>Nathaniel</hi>) our Sauiour Chriſt calleth <hi>a true Iſraelite in whom there is no guile:</hi> which vertue although it be a part of the Chriſtian armour,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.2.

                  <hi>Many men will boaſt, euery one of his owne goodnes, but who can finde a faithfull man?</hi> that is to ſay, who will prooue himſelfe to bee ſuch an one indeede, as hee will ſeeme to be, by word and ſhew? For to ſay the truth, men are ſo infected with hollownes and glozing, and through cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and continuance therein ſo confirmed in it, that vntill God changeth the heart,<note place="margin">Ierem. 13.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieremies</hi> words are true of this one, as of other euils, <hi>It is as poſsible for him who is accuſtomed to euill, to returne and doe good, as for the blacke Moore to change his skinne, or the Leopard her ſpots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this veritie conſiſteth as well in holding and keeping the truth, I meane the ſound knowledge of the word of God in our iudgement, as the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> practiſe of it in a good conſcience. Which I ſay, becauſe there are ſome, who profeſſe great friendſhip to the Goſpell, who yet maintaine ſtrange opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not according to the truth of it: as that the law ought not to be preached in any wiſe: and that there ſhould no differences of men be made; when yet the Scripture putteth difference betwixt good and bad, both in their life and in rewards, Pſalm. 1.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> with ſinceritie: which freely admitteth all opinions to bee meaſured and cenſured by the word.</p>
               <p>Now therefore if this be ſinceritie and vprightnes to be free, not onely from double heartednes and halting, but alſo, to be readie to yeeld a francke aſſent and practiſe to the truth; and alſo if this vertue bee one part of the Chriſtian armour: he who is voyde of this, muſt needes lie open to great danger, both by error in opinion and by corruption in life: for he wanteth that which ſhould defend him.

and power, or (which is all one) by mixing it with the word of God.

And this briefly bee ſaid of the firſt point concerning the Chriſtian armour, to ſhew what it is, and which are the parts of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond point, that the Chriſtian life cannot ſtand without it.</note>Now to go forward to the ſecond, which is, that the Chriſtian life cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſtand without it. He that is willing to liue Chriſtianly throughout his life, (for God giueth vs no libertie of intermiſſion or ſtay) hee muſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to haue this knowledge of the armour ſwimming in his braine, or lying by him in a booke, but to be digeſted of him, and made his owne, and no more ſtand at the putting on of this holie armour, then to doubt of the truth of it: he muſt alwaies bee readie to cloath and furniſh his ſoule with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall parts of it (to couer the nakednes and ſhame thereof, and to make it comely and well fauoured in the ſight of God) as his bodie with apparell: and to arme it therewith as the ſouldier is with his Corſelet, head-piece, ſword, &amp;c. becauſe by it, God hath appointed to defend him, from the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> craftines of his deadly enemie the diuell, and from the deceitfulnes of the moſt noiſome ſinne.</p>
               <p>And moſt ſure it is, to him who will look into it, that all other good helps to godlines, as prayer, reading, conference, though in themſelues very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; yet they doe Chriſtians the leſſe good, if they be without the armour. And therefore when the Apoſtle had taught the Epheſians to practiſe the particular duties of Chriſtianitie, he ſendeth them to this armour, to enable them to ſtand faſt therein, without the which, the diuell (he telleth them) would with his ſubtill baites and deluſions, draw them from whatſoeuer he exhorteth them vnto; yea although they had deſire to bee obedient to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſame.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.13.</note> Thus he writeth, ſaying: <hi>Take vnto you that whole armour of God, that ye may be able to reſiſt in the euill day:</hi> that is, in the hard time, when Sathan ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all his force againſt you, and proclaimeth (as it were) open warre; as well as when the daunger ſeemeth to be ſmaller: and <hi>hauing done all things,</hi> that is, reſiſted your enemie, <hi>ſtand by the ſtrength thereof,</hi> and keepe your ſelues armed ſtill againſt new aſſaults. By this it is cleere, that ſeeing the diuell is a profeſſed enemie of ours, and one that woundeth vs ſecretly, when wee are not aware, and is at hand to doe vs moſt harme, when we doe not ſo much as dreame of any ſuch matter: it is cleere, I ſay, that if wee be not prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch daungers, we muſt needes be ſore hurt. Who goeth foorth naked <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and vnarmed vnto the battell, where ſo many kinds of weapons are readie to take away his life? nay all is little enough, though hee be armed in euerie part.</p>
               <p>That which I ſay in generall of the whole, will better appeare if wee goe through euery particular part of it. For who will aduenture to goe barefoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among thornes and ſtubbes, yea to runne vpon the pikes, but hee will be
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:16851:146"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> well ſhod? euen ſo,<note place="margin">Shod with the preparation.</note> who will be bold to goe thorough the manifold ſtormes and tribulations of this life, which riſe vp in his way, in euery place, not to pricke his feete, but to pierce and goe thorough his heart: as it is ſaid of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> her troubles, <hi>that they ſhould pierce thorough her ſoule,</hi> euen as a ſword,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.35.</note> which goeth to the intrailes: who (I ſay) will go thorough theſe ſtormes, but he will be well armed againſt them, and ſtrongly prepared and ſetled to ſtay himſelf vpon God by the peace and comfort which he draweth from Chriſts owne words, euen theſe: <hi>Though in the world ye ſhall haue tribulation, yet be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, for I haue ouercome the world?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that which I ſay of this one kinde, I may in like manner ſay of all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> parts of the armour which God hath furniſhed a Chriſtian with: that he can walke in no ſafetie thorough the Campe of this world without them,<note place="margin">The ſhield of faith.</note> and euery of them. Who can be free from deſpairing of Gods mercie (which is <hi>a firie</hi> and <hi>venimous dart</hi>) or els from dreadfull doubting and feare (which are companions thereunto) or (which is as deadly and daungerous) from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, vaine hope, and deceiuing of himſelfe, which hath not <hi>the ſhield of faith</hi>; and is not certaine thereby of eternall ſaluation; and of the fauour of God to guard him in this life? And though this man had no other thing to make him vnhappie: yet who doth not ſee, that euen this is enough to make al his pleaſures vnſauourie, if he ſhould either feele the one, or might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of the other?</p>
               <p>Beſides, what is his life (euen at the beſt) when hee hath no truſt in Gods manifold promiſes?

If they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> were not ſometimes armed, they ſhould make as great breaches, and fall as dangerouſly, one day as another: and yet if they were acquainted with this armour thoroughly, they ſhould make their worſt and moſt vncomfortable day in the weeke, equall with the beſt and the happieſt (which they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time inioyed) in heauenly paſſing of their time, and in ſweete comfort. And for want of this armour (either for that men know it not, or for not hauing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:16851:147"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vſe of it) the infinite irkeſomneſſes, heauines, diſtraction, dumpiſhnes, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and feare doe vexe them, and ſuch like deadly poyſons doe occupie the hearts euen of Chriſtians, as alſo <hi>light reioycing in a fleſhly manner,</hi> vaine hope, phantaſticall dreames of peace and ſafetie, where none is. And for want of this, their liues alſo before men are kept from ſhewing foorth light and good example in one thing, as well as in another: yea rather, they are harbourers of ſundrie euill qualities, in ſo much that few are incouraged to waxe better by them, nor to ſuſpect that any thing is amiſſe in them, but are hardened to goe forward in their old courſe ſtill.</p>
               <p>And if it be thus with ſuch, as haue ſome good and ſound beginnings in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Chriſtianitie, let no man meruaile, though they, who are vtterly deſtitute of faith, and of other parts of the Chriſtian armour, be ſo farre off from good life as they be, ſeeing they renounce this arming of themſelues, which I haue proued, that a Chriſtian life cannot be without.</p>
               <p>And now by this which hath been ſaid of the armour hitherto, it is the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to vnderſtand what it is, and what the parts of it are,<note place="margin">The third point is how the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſhould be put on.</note> and how the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life cannot ſtand without it. Now I will proceed (as I haue promiſed) to the third point in this matter concerning the armour, namely, how it ſhould be put on, and be worne, that ſo wee may better ſee how to take that good by it, which God offereth vs. For which end and purpoſe it is to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> marked, that euery true beleeuer in his firſt conuerſion to God, is thereby <hi>made partaker of all things pertaining to life and godlines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.

               <p>This being ſo, a faithfull Chriſtian need not wonder, when he is willed to haue this grace, and parts of this holie armour in a readines; hee neede not wonder (I ſay) where he ſhall haue it, or doubt how to come by it:<note place="margin">Luk. 17.31.</note> For we ſee he hath it alreadie; and as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaid; <hi>The kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen</hi>

For if any ſhould imagine, that he hath it not after beleeuing (as through ignorance he muſt needs) can ſuch an one chooſe, but be exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about this, how hee ſhould come by it, and <hi>put it on?</hi>

If this be darke and hard to any, euen they may know themſelues to be thoſe, who haue not skill to put on this armour, and who haue been ignorant of the vſe and power of it: they haue not well learned the will of God about the neceſſitie and benefit of it.

               <p>For through the vnskilfulnes of men in the right vſe of the armour, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> vnacquaintance with euery part of it, the liues euen of the deare ſeruants of God, are much blemiſhed, and vnglorious amongſt men, and to themſelues (beſides the idlenes, and vnprofitablnes, of them) exceedingly vncheerefull.

treatiſe concerning this matter. Stirre vp, and perſwade thy ſelfe hereto, by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this reaſon, that thou walkeſt naked, except thou be clothed with it: and as an vnarmed man fighting with many ſtrong enemies throughly furniſhed; ſo art thou in this world without it.</p>
               <p>And when by reading, hearing, or conference, thou ſhalt ſee what helpe commeth by thine armour to the well framing of thine heart and life, and by meditation ſometime on the ſeuerall partes of it (as I haue preſcribed) and haſt dulie weighed and muſed vpon the ſame, to affect and ſeaſon thy heart therewith, and by prayer haſt with confidence deſired of God, that euen thou particularly maieſt finde, as thou ſhalt ſee cauſe, thy ſelfe ſtrengthened with euery part of this armour: when (I ſay) thou haſt done this, then haſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> thou put it on. This is the way of putting it on: that when thou knoweſt euery part of it, and whereto it ſerues, and canſt be willing to walke in this ſpirituall attire, thou mayeſt be kept ſafe (as they ſay) from winde and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen from world and diuell.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.14. 2.

It keepeth his ſoule and his life; what ſhould therefore make him ſo ſlauiſh to feare, and full of diſtruſtfull phantaſies, and diſcouragements, as to caſt away his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and wittingly to offer himſelfe into the lions mouth? Euery ſuch ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt put foorth himſelfe to be more bold with reuerence, to take vnto him this armour which none can want with ſafetie) when hee ſeeth who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth him, euen hee that is able to ſtrengthen him, to the obtaining of that which he ſetteth him about, namely, <hi>God all-ſufficient.</hi> He muſt be more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> bold <hi>to keepe his crowne, and honour,</hi> euen this holie armour,<note place="margin">Reue. 3.11.</note> which is more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to him, then life it ſelfe, and ſuffer none to take it from him.</p>
               <p>This I ſpeake for their ſakes, who deſire, as much as I exhort them to:<note place="margin">2.

               <p>And therefore let them vrge themſelues (if they waxe cold or vntoward) to vſe the meanes before mentioned, wherby this armour is put on and held in a readines. And if the meanes themſelues grow vnſauourie with them, ordinarie prayer (I meane) and watchfulnes, as they may eaſily doe, if the heart be diſcouraged or ſet in euill delights, let them driue out that diuell <hi>with faſting and prayer,</hi> and giue <hi>no reſt to their eyes,</hi> nor eaſe to their hearts, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they haue in ſome comfortable manner, recouered their firſt loue and ſtrength, which they had once by this armour; I ſay, let them not reſt till they haue recouered it againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And let them perſwade themſelues, that fearefull daunger is not farre off from them, if they awake not, and that ſpeedily.

               <p>For euen this one is able to carrie vs thorough ſtrong temptations, that we ſhall not halt, and deale hollowly, as men of the world doe, but ſimply and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in a good meaning; yea it keepeth vs merrie and ioyfull, as the Apoſtle ſaith, when ſuch as want it muſt hold down the head: and that I ſay no more, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth our eſtate happie,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.8.</note> according to that which is written; <hi>Bleſſed are the pure and vpright in heart.</hi>

               <p>Now therefore, if ſome one part of this heauenly attire and armour be ſo helpfull, and of ſo great vſe, what thinke wee the whole to be?

               <p>As, in particulars, he being reſolued to put on, and to cloath himſelfe with righteouſnes, and preparation for the croſſe, by the defence and ſhelter of the doctrine of the Goſpell, whiles hee is to warre here in this life, ſhall be brought hereby, to meekenes, patience, and long ſufferance with ioyfulnes,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:16851:150"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>(when God afflicteth him) by the one; and to loue thoſe which are his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to be innocent towards all (becauſe theſe are branches of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes) by the other, and not to be led after the contrarie euils: for all theſe duties, and many more (ſuch are the fruits of the tree of righteouſnes, which God hath planted and watered, in the fruitfull ground of his heart) al theſe, I ſay, ſhall he bring foorth, and many more aboundantly.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, he who hath ſet himſelfe <hi>to ſeeke wiſedome as gold, and to lay vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding as treaſure within him,</hi> he ſhalbe taught the good and perfect way, when others ſhall euer reele and fall; yea when <hi>they ſhall walke in by-waies,</hi>

               <p>And the like fruite I would ſet downe of the reſt, but that I haue done it alreadie, and would not grow tedious, ſeeing much matter to ariſe. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee can like to be accompanied with this holie traine; and loue to goe armed with theſe weapons; with that meaſure of knowledge which God hath taught vs, and to enioy new increaſe daily; armed with righteouſnes and godlines which we can reach and attaine; vpholden in that hope,<note place="margin">Pſa. 119.11.12</note> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> he hath put into vs; ſtrengthened with that faith in all his promiſes, which, at our firſt imbracing them, we receiued; and prepared and ſtaied in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, with peaceable and quiet hearts, by the Goſpell, as he hath incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged vs: then ſhall we be able to liue in all eſtates which God ſhall ſet vs in, and in all places which hee ſhall bring vs to; and chaunge by no occaſions, ſeeing he hath ſtrengthened vs, vntill we ſee an end of all difficulties and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties.</p>
               <p>And all ſuch as conceiue the matter which is preſently handled, ſhould thinke this aduice and counſell ſo needfull for them, of going thus armed thorough the battaile of this life, that they ſhould not think themſelues rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> any day, till they <hi>haue put on the Lord Ieſus</hi> with his <hi>wiſedome, righteouſnes, ſanctification, and redemption:</hi> that is done, when by faith they count him theirs; that ſo they may as farre as Chriſt can helpe them (and wherein can he not?) want nothing.

               <p>And thus to bring this whole matter of the armour to an end alſo: whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou art, who canſt be perſwaded reſolutely, to be thus armed thorough <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> this warfare of thy life, thee will I not doubt to leade into the only ſafe way, yea pleaſant, profitable, beautifull, honourable, and the onely happie way. And thou thy ſelfe ſhalt ſay it in a ſhort time, when through ſome experience thou ſhalt bee able to compare it with all the daies of thy life paſt, euen the beſt of them, and ſhalt finde it, euen at the firſt entrance into it (which is the weakeſt) farre to exceede them in their greateſt beautie. For the longer thou ſhalt abide in it; the better thou ſhalt finde it, and the more it will make thee
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16851:151"/>
to be in loue with it, for that thou ſhalt ſee a continuall vſe of it, and no eſtate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to be comparable to it.</p>
               <p>Neither maketh it any matter, how ignorant thou art (for that perhaps may diſcourage ſome) if thou haſt knowledge enough to ſee this to be the beſt of all other wayes; nor how weake thou art, if thou beeſt ſtrong enough to be perſwaded to walke in it: and geſſe what thou ſhalt want of that which I haue ſaid, when God ſhall giue thee an heart thus inclined, as bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding farwell to all courſes which he approoueth not, to ſettle thee in this, which he commendeth to thee.</p>
               <p>And when thou ſeeſt that thou art acquainted with this armour, and how it helpeth thee daily to liue innocently and chriſtianly, then conſider what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> thou haſt, how rich it maketh thee, and what great priuiledges the Lord hath giuen thee:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.34.</note> and then as <hi>Abigaile</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dauid, when thou ſhalt reape ſuch fruite of it, thou ſhalt not repent that thou tookeſt ſuch counſaile:</hi> be glad of them, be highly thankfull for them, more then if thou haddeſt found great treaſure: weigh what protection againſt the diuell, thou haſt thereby: what ſafe-conduct from falles: what feare and doubts thou art deliuered from: what miſts of ignorance, as ſcales from thine eyes, are pluckt from thine heart: what ſtrength againſt thy ſtrongeſt infirmities thou findeſt; how ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily thou maiſt turne into the way againe, if at any time by weakenes thou haſt ſlipped: yea conſider moreouer what peace to thy conſcience thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> haſt, and reſt to thy ſoule: when thou ſeeſt, not onely more cleerely then before thou wert thus armed, that <hi>there is no condemnation to thee</hi>; but alſo that God now fighteth for thee and maketh thee fit to reſiſt the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſtrong temptations, who wert before ſo faint and impotent in reſiſting them.</p>
               <p>In few words to ſpeake what I thinke meete, concerning this matter, thou canſt neuer ſufficiently eſteeme of this bleſſed eſtate, although thou art not vtterly free from all temporall afflictions thereby. Oft times ſhalt thou be thinking, it is too good to continue: till thou remembreſt that <hi>there is no ſhadowe of changing with God.</hi> Oft times thou ſhalt wonder to ſee, what a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> liberall portion God hath giuen thee, to haue ſuch ſweete communion with him, and to haue confidence and boldnes before him, in all difficulties: when the moſt part of the world is euer ſubiect to moſt dreadfull feare of his vengeance, as oft as he ſhall ſhew them the danger wherein they lie. And when thou ſhalt ſee and feele all this, how much it is worth, to be thus fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in from daily vexations, which moſt men are turmoyled withall; then thou ſhalt not neede to doubt, whether thou ſhalt be willing to keepe on this armour ſtill, for thou ſhalt ſee that thou canſt not feele thy ſelfe well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obiection.</note>Now whereas it may be obiected, who, or where is the man, which find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> this libertie in his life? or what arming of a man is able to ſet him in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from the manifold euils, which moſt men complaine of daily? I affirme of my knowledge in all reuerence giuing the praiſe and glory of it to God,<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> that there are many ſuch, who to the peace of their conſcience enioy it; and I as little doubt, that there are many more whom I know not: And yet I am perſwaded, that thouſands euen of Gods deare ſeruants are holden
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:16851:151"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> backe from this bleſſing through the malice of our common enemie, who are kept at a ſtay by his ſubtilty, either ignorant of this libertie, and thinking that God doth not honour any of his ſeruants with ſuch priuiledges while they liue here, and therefore count it preſumption to looke for any ſuch thing: or if they know it, yet doe fauour themſelues in their preſent wants and infirmities, and doe vſe ſmall violence againſt the ſame: and ſo they are holden backe from inioying this comfort and bleſſednes in their liues, which they might otherwiſe be partakers of.</p>
               <p>For let all know this, that the ſuffering of their hearts to take their fill in the delights of this world, and little paines taken in muſing vpon this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> eſtate, and their ſlight praying for it, is the principall cauſe (ſeeing God hath promiſed to worke by meanes) why Chriſtians haue not further acquaintance with this armed life, and the bleſſed fruites thereof: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other attaine not hereto, ſeeing they neuer vnderſtand (although they are not vtterly without faith) that God hath appoynted them to liue after any certaine direction throughout their courſe, and to be armed thereunto, but in a generall manner onely ſerue God, without any great watchfulnes ouer their particular actions.</p>
               <p>Now if they count this burthenſome, they muſt bee content to bee brought to ſhame ſometimes for their doings, and ſometimes to terrour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and torment of conſcience, for their ſlippery walking, and ſmall regard of honoring God, aſwell in one duties as in another, ſeeing theſe are properties of ſinne, which cannot be ſeparated from it, that howſoeuer they oft feare no ſuch thing, yet one time or other it will finde them out. This diet, I ſay, they muſt oftentimes looke to be kept at (who ſettle not themſelues ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Chriſtian life) euen to finde here much ſhame and ſorrow, which other of Gods ſeruants ſhall be voyde of. And if it be ſo with them, iudge what is the eſtate of the hypocrite, and prophane ſort?</p>
               <p>But that none may bee troubled at that which I haue ſet downe of the power and vſe of the armour: as thinking that which I haue ſaid,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> but a meere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> fancie and vntruth, ſeeing the enemies which wee fight againſt, are ſtrong and raging; and many good ſeruants of God haue been ſubdued of them in temptation: whereas I haue not ſpoken much (ſay they) of the conflicts and combats, which they haue with the allurements of ſinne, as though they reſiſted and ouercame them with eaſe, and without any great ſtriuing: To ſatiſfie ſuch, I anſwere that the ſpeaking of conflicts belongeth to another treatiſe, namely the fift, where I handle the doctrine of the lets; here I onely ſpeake of the armour, according to the parts of the diuiſion ſet downe;<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> and yet none can vnderſtand me (if he marke) that I thinke ſinne and our luſts to bee eaſily ouercome, which I call furious and raging; or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Sathans ſuggeſtions by obiects or without, to be ſoone reſiſted, which I ſay, are both ſlyly wrought to deceiue vs, and to haue mightie force to draw and allure vs: but rather euery diſcreete reader may gather, that I count it the moſt hard and difficult of all other things to ſubdue, and conquer them, becauſe I ſhew ſuch neceſſitie of walking armed continually againſt them. For what can I ſay leſſe, then that we muſt ſtriue manfully, and ſtand vpon our watch, and that we <hi>cannot be crowned except we ſtriue lawfully,</hi> that is, ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly:
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:16851:152"/>
yea and that for all our armour, we being vnskilfull, or faint and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in vſing it, nor onely we may be, but alſo are oft times foyled, as if hope of victorie and of preuailing againſt them, were paſt.</p>
               <p>All this I ſay: and yet in the weakeſt eſtate, we are not <hi>forſaken of God, though in ſome diſtreſſe for a time:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>nor ſwallowed vp, though we be in ſorrow: nor in deſpaire, when we be in ſome diſcomfort,</hi> but when we are at the loweſt ebbe, that in ſome temptation we yeeld and be ouercome of it: yet euen in that we are not ſo miſerable as others who ſtriue not at all, but are for a while left to our ſelues to ſee our weakenes, that afterwards wee may gather more ſtrength, and (as it were) fetch our breath, that we may take better hold, and reſiſt more valiantly; eſpecially when through any of our owne defaults,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> we were ouercome: And yet whenſoeuer it is ſo with vs, who can deny, but that it ſo came to paſſe, becauſe we were no better armed? and for that we were either vnskilfull and vnexpert, or ſlouthfull and ſlacke in vſing it? So that, I ſay ſtill, as I ſaid before, that whatſoeuer our temptations and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults be, by the helpe of our armour, as Chriſt our captaine hath taught vs to weare and keepe it on, we preuaile and thereby reioyce; euen as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, we muſt needes ſorrow, whiles we bee naked and vnarmed in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile. But we may for iuſt cauſe be vpholden, and warre cheerefully againſt all kinds of enemies,<note place="margin">Ioſh. 1.8. 2.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I haue ſhewed, how the third helpe, namely the Chriſtian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is an eſpeciall furthering of vs in a godly life.<note place="margin">Two obiections. The firſt.</note> But becauſe I know, that this which I ſay, will ſeeme to ſome very doubtfull, and ſcarce like to be true, that for want of putting on, and keeping on this Chriſtian armour, their eſtate is both vnglorious and vncomfortable (who yet are of this minde, that they may be Chriſtians good enough, though they know it not) I will therefore ſatisfie ſuch as I can,<note place="margin">The ſecond ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> in few words. Other ſome thinke, that although it is fit and meete for ſtrong Chriſtians, yet that weake ones ought not to be troubled with the ſeeking for it, but may content themſelues to ſerue God as they can, without it: their reaſon is this, leaſt whiles we lay <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſuch ſtrong loade and burthens on them, being yet but weake, we diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and driue them out of heart, altogether.</p>
               <p>Theſe two obiections indeed, the wit of man after the hearing of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent doctrine of the armour, will be readie to put forth, and he that is paſt both theſe doubts, and troubled with neither of them, I thinke (nay, I know) that he hath ouercome much, and hath well profited. For the ſatisfying of thoſe who are weaker, I will anſwere a little to both. To the formoſt, why ſhould any thinke,<note place="margin">The firſt obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction anſwered.</note> that they may be good Chriſtians without this, ſeeing they muſt needes graunt, that if they walke nakedly, they cannot walke ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (euery man being a blinde guide to himſelfe:) I deny not, but that a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Chriſtian fearing God, and beleeuing in him, may be ignorant of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; but then let not ſuch ſay, that they may ſerue God well enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, it, which is here obiected: for that is farre off from the moſt zealous, and he who thinketh himſelfe forwardeſt, yea and hath a large heart filled with holy deſires, is farre off from it. For what ſubſtance of godlines is there in ſuch a life, that it ſhould be a ſeruing of God aright, and as it is behoofull?
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:16851:152"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſeeing it ſhall be found both idle and vnprofitable, or a wandring courſe, and that which is in no wiſe to bee reſted in without the helpe of the armour: from which they haue their ſtrength to liue well, whoſoeuer hath any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace to liue godly, as by conſidering the force and vſe of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour may be eaſily ſeene. And therefore it is a ſpeech at the leaſt, full of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, to ſay, we may ſerue God as it is meete, although wee haue no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the armour.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond obiection,<note place="margin">The ſecond ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> that it ſeemeth to bee too heauie a burdening of weake Chriſtians, to impoſe and lay it vpon them, it is as vnſauourie as the former. For they who are new borne (which ſort is the weakeſt and feebleſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in Gods familie) are no ſooner brought out of the thraldome, and feare of damnation (wherein Sathan held them before) but if they were able to ſpeake, they would firſt aske for this, that they might euer abide in the eſtate of ſaluation, wherein they now ſee themſelues to be, and neuer forget Gods kindnes, but daily and hourely feele and enioy it: alſo to honour him for it, to teſtifie their thankfulnes, to pleaſe him in all things, and in all eſtates, and for this cauſe to know his will: for all which purpoſes the armour ſerueth: This (I ſay) is their nature, and this deſire is in them, euen when they are at the weakeſt, as the young infant crieth for nouriſhment. So that none ſhall need to feare, that they be preſſed ſore by offering them this, being euen that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which they moſt deſire and long for. The ſeede doth no more naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to pricke vp out of the ground, and ſo giue hope of an harueſt, though it be held backe by ſtormes and cold, then the young Chriſtian doth deſire to be holpen forward in the forementioned graces, and cloathed with them, as he is able to reach to them. And what other thing is this, then to deſire to be well armed, to the end that God may be daily honoured and obeyed of him, and he himſelfe may proſper and keepe his ſoule in ſafetie? True it is, he is not ſetled herein to his contentation: and who marueileth at it? hath not the young child, and tender plant their ſeaſon to grow vp in? but when they ſhoote foorth and flouriſh (as they may doe, for their time) will not all ſay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that they proſper, though they haue their wintring, as well as their ſomme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring time? So it is with the beloued, though weake Chriſtians, and children of God: who although they haue many diſcouragements and hindrances, as the ſtormie cold is to the young plants, and many ſore doubts, feares, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts, as nippings of their growing, by the diuell, and their owne ſtrong reliques of their corruptions; yet do they, being rooted in good ground, and well watred, and weathered (as there is none to the armour, which Gods word teacheth) grow vp and proſper as the Lords plants.</p>
               <p>But it may be, that ſome beholding diuers zealous and godly Chriſtians, (for in reſpect of the common ſort they may ſo be accounted) who haue bin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> both pricked in conſcience for their ſin, and ſeemed to haue receiued com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and to be earneſt louers of the word, and the greateſt bringers on of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to religion in many places, who yet ſeeme not to be thus armed againſt ſinne; therefore much leſſe new borne babes in Chriſtianitie are fit to bee vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with it: to this I ſay, what effects of the Miniſterie ſuch haue had, it skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, neither how they haue been affected by hearing the word, nor with what zeale they profeſſe it: and therefore no good reaſon, that if ſuch haue
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:16851:153"/>
not had vſe of it, therefore that weake Chriſtians ſhould not be forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> For it hath been prooued, that the weakeſt, if they be the Lords, doe deſire it: and therefore the other (in what account ſoeuer they goe) if they doe not ſo, but can thinke themſelues in caſe good enough without it, are hereby brought into ſuſpition of baſtardie, and that they are not the Lords, though ſome things worthie commendation may be in them, more then in many others. Neither ought this which I ſay, ſeeme ſtraunge: for both in Scripture, and in experience, many haue ſhined as lights for a ſeaſon, and in ſhew of zeale and godly life, haue been (both of the Miniſters and people) in account aboue the moſt: who for all this, haue ſhamefully fallen from their firſt loue, ſuch as it ſeemed ſometime to be. And therfore no marueile,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> though this vrging of the Chriſtian armour doe not ſauour greatly to them, which yet is ſauourie to the new borne in Gods houſehold.</p>
               <p>But of thoſe men, which haue ſeemed forwarder then they are, I haue here no fit place to deale further with them: onely let them conſider what daunger it carrieth with it, to haue been in likelihood of goodnes, and now not to be:<note place="margin">Prou. 4.18.</note> and whether this be with <hi>the righteous to ſhine daily more and more, as the light doth, vnto the perfect day.</hi> I conclude that which I propounded to anſwere, that the putting on the armour of a Chriſtian, is not too ſtrong meate for the yongeſt that is nouriſhed vp in Gods houſe, nor too weightie a burden to lay vpon them, but the very ſame, which of all other things they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> moſt deſire, as they can diſcerne it, that they may more fruitfully and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerue God thereby.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the other is that which men get out of the letter of the Scripture onely, and ſo haue it but by rule. For by the word of God we learne both: and that ſuch knowledge doth better vs, ſhall appeare afterwards.</p>
               <p>Now, if wee will ſee more cleerely what this experience is, conſider of it after this manner: Compare it with experimentall knowledge in all trades and ſciences, what a difference there is betwixt it, and bare and naked skill in the ſame without experience. So it ſhall the better appeare what this is, in matters which are heauenly and ſpirituall, in reſpect of the bare knowledge, that men haue by rule or inſtruction onely. He that hath been trained vp in an occupation, it may be, hee hath got knowledge and skill in his ſcience or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> trade: but he is not able to vſe it to the beſt aduantage and his owne greateſt profit, neither how, where, and when, to buy and to ſell, and how to diſpoſe of all things, that hee may not decay and grow behind hand, but thriue and proſper. Theſe (I ſay) and ſuch like, he is ignorant in, and all for want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: All which, he that hath been exerciſed in, and acquainted with, is able to doe, as God ſhall ſee good to bleſſe him in the ſame.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo it is in the ſpirituall trade. For a man that hath bin taught ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly out of the word of God, &amp; catechized in the principall points of Chriſtian religion, is able by the helpe thereof, to make a confeſſion of his faith, and <hi>giue an account of the hope that is in him:</hi> and to anſwere ſoundly to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> queſtions that ſhall be put foorth to him. But all this is but the knowledge of the letter, if hee goe no further: and may delight a good man to ſee it in him, rather, then yeeld any great fruite, towards Gods kingdome, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. But the Chriſtian, who hath had the proofe of this knowledge, that is, how it hath been effectuall to him: how it hath aſſured him of his owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: reformed and chaunged him, and caſt out the filthines of heart and life, which was in him before, and ſo hath wrought in him many other waies; he (I ſay) that hath experience of this, hath receiued another manner of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then the other, and is like daily to receiue much more.</p>
               <p>Such a thing is experience: for hee conſidereth, obſerueth, and applieth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the things which he heareth, ſeeth, and doth, to his owne vſe: and by things paſt thus duly regarded, hee learneth and getteth wiſedome to aduiſe and guide him for the preſent, and the time to come: no otherwiſe, then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced husbandman doth in his calling and dealings. And by this wee may gather what experience is. Now to ſhew how farre it reacheth, we may vnderſtand, that <hi>it maketh vs wiſe in all things, which are profitable to godlines, and eternall life:</hi> in ſo much, as our life is little worth if it be not helped by this. For till wee begin to marke how true euery part of Gods word is, and that God doth daily execute that in the world, which he ſaith in his word, he wil bring to paſſe, we reuerence it not, neither regard it, but only in ſpeech and in ſhew: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> till we marke and obſerue, how God puniſheth the hollow hearted, and <hi>the workers of iniquitie,</hi> we feare not to doe ill: and ſo on the contrarie, till we find how ſweete and pleaſant a thing it is, to be gathered vnder the Lords wings, and what a ſhelter and defence he is to his faithfull ſeruants, wee make no reckoning of his ſeruice, but it is vnſauourie and vnwelcome to vs. But the experience of Gods dealing toward vs, and of the carriage of our ſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, in what courſe we beſt proſper and finde moſt reſt to our ſoules,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:16851:154"/>
this bringeth the true feare of God, which is the onely wiſedome. For the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> due conſideration and remembrance of the time paſt, and Gods worke therein, is a forcible meane, through his bleſſing, to make vs goe forward better and better in the Chriſtian way. For when wee can ſay, vpon good proofe and triall,<note place="margin">Experience of the fruite of a godly life, the beſt meane to continue it.</note> that wee haue ſeene that it <hi>hath alwayes gone well with ſuch as are vpright in heart,</hi> and innocent in their liues, and with our ſelues, when wee haue walked after the ſame rule; and that when wee haue kept our ſelues from the defilements of the world, <hi>we haue ſeene good dayes,</hi> and liued comfortably: this eſtabliſheth vs in the ſame courſe moſt firmely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly afterwards: and when wee haue obſerued, that God hath puniſhed ſecuritie, an ill conſcience, raſhnes, and wilfull ſinning (as they are very blind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that marke not that) this experimentall knowledge bringeth great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in the choyce of our wayes, and cauſeth vs <hi>to take heede to our ſelues, that it may goe well with vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when we are able to ſay we haue in our troubles humbled our ſelues to God, confeſſed our ſinnes, and ſought pardon in faith, and had hope to ſee a good ende of it,<note place="margin">Experience how affliction hath beſt end and is a rule for euer after. <hi>Pſal. 120.1. 1. Sam. 17.34.</hi>
                  </note> and patience to beare it, and haue (though it ſeemed very vnlike for the time) found and obtained it; this is a cleere demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to vs, that therefore in the like trouble, we ſhall finde the like bleſſing by the like meanes vſing. And this experience neuer faileth, if wee rightly ground it, that is, if that which wee haue marked to bee wrought by God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> hath been agreeable to that which in his word hath been ſpoken by him. This wee finde to haue often ſtirred vp the deare ſeruant of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.10.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauid,</hi> both to bee comforted in his affliction, becauſe before he had ſo been, and alſo to bee conſtant in a godly life, becauſe that hee had <hi>marked that it euer bringeth a peaceable ende.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.37.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And what maruaile ſhould this be to any, who are trained vp in the Lords houſe? For this we know, that as in all trades or ſciences, the beginnings are hardeſt and fulleſt of diſcouragements; ſo it fareth with Chriſtians, namely, that their firſt entrings are moſt doubtfull, and fulleſt of weakenes: yet who cannot remember that euen then, God wrought moſt louingly for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> them, and dealt moſt tenderly with them, when their faith was yet ſo weake and young, that they could not well diſcerne it? For how hath he kept many of them from ſore falles, holden them from manifold and great afflictions, and not brought many of their ſinnes to light at once, leaſt they ſhould haue been diſcouraged (euen as he hath promiſed <hi>to regard their weakenes</hi>) whereas otherwiſe they muſt needes haue been driuen to great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other ſuch like, why hath the Lord done them, but that his children ſhould marke and obſerue them, to learne experience by them againſt the times which ſhall come after? and that they might ſafely and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> boldly promiſe vnto themſelues, greater proofe of his aſſiſtance and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindnes towards them? And why hath he giuen a good end of their former chaſtiſements when they penitently deſire it? euen to this end, that their hope may be ſtrengthened for the times that ſhall come after: As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of himſelfe and other godly people; <hi>God hath deliuered vs, doth deliuer vs: and we truſt in him, that yet hereafter he will deliuer vs.</hi> Alſo
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:16851:154"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> why preſerued hee them from fearefull falles, when they earneſtly craued it; or made the way of godlines more eaſie, then they could haue hoped for? but to hearten them on to looke more confidently for the like grace and bleſſing, when they haue now receiued longer proofe of Gods kindnes toward them, and of his keeping promiſe with them,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.10.</note> if they ſhall ſeeke him in the ſame dutifull manner that they were wont to doe?<note place="margin">Eſay. 59.1.</note> 
                  <hi>For the Lords hand is not ſhortned that he cannot helpe,</hi> but is neerer to them,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.5.</note> as they are better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him to beleeue it. So that as men who haue found out the way to bring in profit, cannot be diſſwaded from it: euen ſo it fareth with theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> But wofull it is, that where ſo great benefit and gaine might bee reaped by ſo ſmall trauaile,<note place="margin">VVofull that men learne not experience.</note> euen by marking Gods manner of dealing with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: yet that ſo few ſhould be brought to this wiſedome, and perſwaded <hi>to ſeeke out the beſt and happieſt way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 14.6.</note> which yet is not hard to them that would gladly finde it. For I muſt ſpeake the truth, and God hee knoweth it, that few ſet themſelues about this worke to get this experience, when yet they haue oft ſmarted for their fooliſhnes: but for all that they loue to lie in it ſtill, more fooliſh then children, who cannot bee made to come nigh the water, when they haue once been in perill of drowning: and ſo they verifie the words of Chriſt, Prou. 1.22. <hi>O ye fooles, how long will ye loue fooliſhnes?</hi> Which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> is the cauſe, why not onely the moſt part of hearers are dead and cold practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers: but euen many of the teachers, though they do boldly vtter that which they haue read, yet are faint followers of that which they teach: or conceale much of that which they ſhould deliuer, becauſe they finde the contrarie to be done of themſelues, which they ſee, they ſhould teach others; and would ſhunne the reproch of the prouerbe; <hi>Phyſition heale thine owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</hi> But they who turne their thoughts, conſideration, wiſedome, and ſtudie, to this, marking what is the bleſſed courſe of life, and how it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto: as they ſhall declare that they are wiſe; ſo ſhall they bee ſure to finde a ſingular helpe to godlines, which they ſhal neuer repent of trauailing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for.</p>
               <p>It followeth in the next place, that we ſee, how God hath prouided no leſſe helpe for vs in companie, which becauſe we haue much vſe of,<note place="margin">The fourth and fift priuate helpe.</note> and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be often in it,<note place="margin">Of the vſe of company in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie exerciſe, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, &amp;c.</note> therefore leaſt we might poſſibly returne out from it worſe then we went into it (as the moſt companies are ſuch as doe make men more corrupt then they were before) therefore the Lord hath taught his people how to carry themſelues in all their meetings with others, in ſuch wiſe, as not onely they may ſhunne the harme which is eaſily gotten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but alſo haue much helpe and furtherance thereby to goe better forward in Chriſtian duties.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing now made mention of the two firſt kindes of the priuate helpes, the third followeth, containing the helps which may be vſed by ones ſelfe alone, or with others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: as prayer and reading. Prayer is a calling vpon God according to his will: and hath theſe two parts: thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and requeſt; whereunto is added the confeſſion of ſinnes.<note place="margin">Thankſgiuing.</note> Thankſgiuing is that part of prayer, in which, we being comforted by ſome benefit, which in fauour God beſtoweth vpon vs, are drawne to loue and praiſe him, and ſhew forth the fruites thereof. In the which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription we ſee three duties to be required of vs, and three motiues or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,<note place="margin">Three perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to moue to thankſgiuing.</note> to drawe vs to performe them. I will firſt mention theſe latter, and then proceede to the duties. The firſt motiue is knowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſome benefit receiued or promiſed vs.<note place="margin">The firſt. <hi>1. Sam. 25.32. Geneſ. 24.27. Luk. 17.15.</hi>
                  </note> Which may be ſeene in the thankſgiuings of all Gods ſeruants; as in <hi>Dauid</hi> after that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the ſauorie and ſeaſonable counſell by <hi>Abigaile:</hi> and in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſeruant, when God had bleſſed him in his iourney to <hi>Aram.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of the leaper, when he ſaw that he was clenſed, after he had made requeſt for it to Chriſt. And where there is no knowledge and due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſome particular mercie, how can there be any true, and hartie thankſgiuing, howſoeuer in words there be a proteſtation for faſhion ſake? as in them who ſay, we muſt thanke God for all, when yet they conſider of nothing that moues them thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond.</note>The ſecond motiue to thankſgiuing, is ioy and gladnes of heart for the benefit which we thinke of, or call to minde: As appeareth by the pſalme, in them which returned out of the captiuitie,<note place="margin">Pſal. 126.1.2.</note> ſaying; <hi>When the Lord brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> againe</hi> (that is, turned away) <hi>the captiuitie of Sion</hi> (his Church) <hi>we became like them that dreame: then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ioy.</hi> And except we finde ſuch ſweetenes in Gods benefits either alreadie receiued, or by faith embraced, being promiſed; the dutie of thankes can in no good ſort be performed: But that is verified which is commonly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that is, a worke is vntowardly done which is not cheerefully gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The third.</note>The third thing that ſhould moue vs to this dutie of thankes, is that which is moſt fit to worke the foreſaid ioy, and that is a perſwaſion, that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, for which we giue thankes, commeth to vs from Gods fatherly loue:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> which is a farre greater matter to make vs glad, then the benefit it ſelfe, which is beſtowed on vs.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 116.5. to 16.</note> For if we ſhould feare that it is ſent as a ſnare to intangle vs, or to heape hot coales vpon our head, and to make our condemnation the more iuſt, ſmal ſweetenes ſhould we finde therein, but that which would be quenched with that feare, and by an accuſing conſcience.</p>
               <p>As for example, what hartie ioy, or ſound thankes could that of the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:16851:155"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Phariſie be, though in tongue he gaue the one,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.11.</note> and in countenance ſhewed the other, when he had not this perſwaſion? But God be thanked, it is not ſo with his beloued ones: but they knowing that their moſt louing father <hi>hath giuen them his Chriſt,</hi> which is the greateſt, doth much more of fauour giue <hi>them all other things,</hi> which are of leſſe account; which both reioyce their hearts, when they remember any of theſe his bleſſings, and ſtirreth them vp to a much more heartie performing of this dutie.</p>
               <p>And as theſe three former things muſt be found in vs to moue vs to true thankfulnes for our comfort: ſo to make it effectuall three duties are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Firſt, a continuance of our loue to God. Secondly,<note place="margin">Three duties required in thankſgiuing.</note> a deſire to ſet foorth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> his glorie, and in words to profeſſe and confeſſe his goodnes. Thirdly, a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceeding in obedience, and walking worthie his kindnes. For how can we chooſe but loue and ſet our hearts vpon him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1.</hi> Loue of God.</note> when wee may ſee the fruites of his fauour on euery ſide, whither ſoeuer we turne our ſelues, <hi>and the ſame euery morning renued?</hi> Euen as the Prophet ſaith: <hi>I loue the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.1.</note> 
                  <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath heard my requeſt,</hi> and for his great and many mercies, which there hee reckoneth vp. So that they, whoſe loue is ſet vpon the gift it ſelfe, and the benefit; being little affected towards the giuer and beſtower of it, how wide ſoeuer their mouthes are open in giuing thankes; they are farre from the right offering of thankes to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Now if we loue the Lord, we cannot but be carried with a feruent deſire,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> A deſire to ſet foorth his glorie. <hi>2. Cor. 4.13.</hi>
                  </note> that God might bee knowne and beleeued on by others, that they might come out of darknes: neither can we ſatisfie our ſelues in ſeeking to aduance and magnifie him. As wee may ſee in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who being ſtirred vp by the conſideration of Gods benefits, had this affection in him, thus declaring the ſame: <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord, for all his benefits?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Oh,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.12.</note> that I knew, and could ſatisfie my ſelfe herein. And where this affection and deſire is, can it otherwiſe be, but that by all good opportunities, there ſhould be an expreſſing, and an acknowledging of this his goodnes? Euen as the ſame perſon ſetteth himſelfe downe to vs for an example, <hi>I will praiſe the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 111.</note> 
                  <hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and call vpon him with thankſgiuing:</hi> and elſewhere in the congregation in heart and tongue: and with inſtruments well tuned and of many kinds.</p>
               <p>Now with theſe before mentioned, if this laſt propertie be adioyned,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>3.</hi> A further proceeding in obedience.</note> 
                  <hi>that we walke worthie his kindnes,</hi> and within holie compaſſe, which is to doe the will of our heauenly father, then doe wee rightly performe this dutie of thankſgiuing. The which one, if it be wanting from the reſt, maketh them all lame and maimed, and as odious to God, as the mortlings and vntimely firſt borne of the beaſts, which were offered to him in ſacrifice. And how with our thankſgiuing reformation of our liues ſhould goe, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſheweth, by ſetting downe the daunger of the contrarie, ſaying:<note place="margin">Deut. 6.10, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>When the Lord thy God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hath brought thee into the land, which he ſware to thy fathers, Abraham, Iſaac and Iacob, to giue thee, with great and goodly cities which thou buildedſt not: and houſes full of all manner of goods, which thou filledſt not: and welles digged, which thou dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedſt not: vineyards and Oliue trees, which thou plantedſt not: and when thou hast eaten and art full, beware leaſt thou forget the Lord</hi> (in ſteed of remembring his kindnes and bountie) <hi>but feare and ſerue him.</hi> So the Pſalmiſt ſaith:<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.16.</note> 
                  <hi>What doeſt thou taking my word in thy mouth,</hi> either in thanks, prayer, or ſpeaking of it, <hi>and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:16851:156"/>
hateſt to be reformed by it?</hi> And theſe are the three duties, neceſſarily required <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to be in true thankfulnes.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue ſhewed what thankſgiuing is, and what properties are required in it, to the end it may rightly be performed to God. Now then, if this dutie be thus performed of vs, in aduerſitie as in proſperitie; for ſo God will haue them doe, who worſhip him aright, Iob. 27.10. and alone by our ſelues, as well as in companie with others, that ſo we may be free from hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie in offering it: muſt it not needes be a ſingular helpe, with the reſt, vnto godlines?<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5.19.</note> I ſay, when wee ſhall many times from day to day, thinke vpon Gods louing kindnes, how great it is, and hath been towards vs, and finde ſweetnes in his benefits, as being perſwaded that wee haue them in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> when for them, we ſhall haue our hearts inlarged to loue the giuer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his goodnes to others with a deſire to honour him, and be more readie to our particular duties; when wee ſhall frame our ſelues in all eſtates to this thankfulnes: is it not a mightie and forcible meanes to mollifie the hard hart, and to hold vnder the ſturdie corruptions of it, ſo that they may be ſubiect to God, yea euen when ſtrong prouocations doe draw to the contrarie?</p>
               <p>Then we cannot be ignorant that thankfulnes is one helpe, and that not the leaſt, to the continuance of a godly life: whether wee vnderſtand it of that ſolemne thankſgiuing, which wee adioyne ordinarily to our ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or that which now and then wee doe vſe in a more briefe manner by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> any occaſion offered.<note place="margin">Confeſſion of ſinnes another helpe to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life.</note> And this of thankſgiuing. With this we are to adde ſupplications, which alſo containe confeſſion of our ſinne: all which three are indeed but one action generally, but particularly haue euery one of them an eſpeciall and ſeuerall vſe. Therefore it followeth to ſhew, in what ſort we ſhould make confeſſion of our ſinnes, and our priuate requeſts to God, that they may much more be helpes to godlines altogether, when one part, euen thankſgiuing is ſo great an helpe alone.</p>
               <p>And firſt, of confeſſion of ſinnes, as in order it is to bee vſed, next vnto thankfulnes: and afterwards, of the making or offering vp of our requeſts and ſuites vnto God,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.8.9. Pſal. 32.5.6.</note> and namely, for the remiſsion of ſinnes, with the which, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> euer to be ioyned. Now this is an acknowledging of our ſelues to be guiltie, and worthily to haue deſerued Gods wrath, and manifold puniſhments, for our grieuous faults and offences: and an acknowledging of them alſo, with a free and humble bewailing of them before the Lord; ſuch as are vnknowne to vs, in a generall manner, but thoſe which wee doe know (according to the nature of them) particularly. And this dutie is rightly done and practiſed of vs:<note place="margin">Foure things in confeſſion.</note> firſt, when we feele our ſinnes odious, and burdenſome to vs. Secondly, when we accuſe our ſelues of them to God. Thirdly, when we confeſſe them to him (hauing examined our life) and that we ſtand at his mercie deſeruing to be condemned. And fourthly, when wee abaſe our ſelues thereby, and ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> are meekned, and our pride abated. In all the confeſſions of the ſeruants of God, all theſe foure are to be found; that I may ſhew it at once, and not ſtand long about euery one of them. As in <hi>Dauids</hi> confeſſion, after that <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet had accuſed him, ſaying, <hi>thou art the man,</hi> euen this great offender, he anſwered,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue ſinned:</hi> in which one word, he found and ſhewed al things that are required in a true and penitent confeſſion: that is, that he both had
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:16851:156"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> his ſinne in a deteſtable execration, accuſed himſelfe to God of it, confeſſed that he had iuſtly prouoked God againſt him, and was greatly humbled by it. In the Pſalme, if any doubt of this,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.4.5.</note> hee may ſee them particularly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. The ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Daniel</hi> his confeſſion in the ninth chapter;<note place="margin">Dan. 9.5.</note> and in the Publicanes, when he knocking on his breaſt, and looking downe to the ground, as aſhamed to looke vp, ſaid, <hi>God be mercifull to me a ſinner.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 18.13.</note> All theſe are likewiſe in the confeſſion of the prodigall ſonne. The firſt in theſe words, <hi>he came to himſelfe,</hi> and entred into conſideration of his life paſt, with himſelfe, whereby he felt his burden ſo great; that ſecondly,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.17. Verſ. 21.</note> he commeth and accuſeth himſelfe to his father; and thirdly, what hee thought of his deſerts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> may eaſily be gathered, when he asked not ſuch mercie, as to bee counted a ſonne, but thought it a large fauour to haue the place of an hired ſeruant:<note place="margin">Verſ. 19. &amp; 21</note> which alſo doth cleerely lay foorth his abaſement.</p>
               <p>What manner of confeſſion therefore we ſhould make ordinarily in our prayers to God, by this may be ſeene: (if it be otherwiſe framed, that is, out of our owne braine God will reiect it) and then ſhall we not (as many doe, to their little comfort) coldly confeſſe our ſinnes in generall, nor for faſhion,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 12.20.</note> but in particular, and thoſe eſpecially, by which wee haue moſt offended God. Now this confeſſion being from time to time oft made vnto God, ſhall not ſuffer vs to goe farre, and lie long in any ſinne, but hunt it out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> it be warme and neſtled in vs. And when we ſee euery while, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to confeſſe our ſinnes, how we haue burthen enough of our ſinne, although we ſinne not wilfully; who ſeeth not, but that we ſhall be much preſerued euen by confeſſing them in this manner that I haue ſet downe, from daungerous falles and offences? So that the very confeſſing of our ſinnes, which is but one branch of our prayer, is of great force to ſtrengthen vs in a godly life.</p>
               <p>And as for the obiection of them, which ſay,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> that the oft comming to performe this duetie, will make it common, and without force to kill our ſinne: I anſwere them thus:<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> God hauing promiſed by this and ſuch other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> helpes to chaine vp the vnrulines of our nature, doth graunt to his ſeruants (for all the rebellion that remaineth in them) much to preuaile againſt it; ſo that ordinarily they may finde eaſe by theſe helpes, and a cheerefull readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to the vſing of them; much more then they, who by cuſtome in earthly matters, finde hard things eaſie.</p>
               <p>Thus I hauing ſhewed how thankeſgiuing and confeſſion of ſinne ſhould be vſed, and being ſo vſed, what helpes they are to godlines, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth that I ſpeake to the ſame end, of requeſt making to God:<note place="margin">Requeſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe to liue godly.</note> how that ought to be done, that the like fruite may be reaped thereby: Of the which the leſſe ſhall neede to be ſaid, ſeeing this point is after handled, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> more is written of it, then of the former two. Requeſt is that part of prayer,<note place="margin">What requeſt is.</note> in which we earneſtly power out our ſuites vnto God, in contrition of heart, according to his will, with a comfortable hope that through Chriſt wee ſhall be heard, and therefore forſaking the ſinne which might hinder our ſuite. Wherein briefly note theſe foure things neceſſarie to be ioyned with this dutie whenſoeuer we goe about it.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that we ſhew this contrition of heart,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Sam. 1.15.</hi> The firſt thing in requeſt.</note> by being preſſed with

feeling our wants, vnworthines, miſerable eſtate, and manifold neceſſities,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> earneſtly deſiring to be pardoned and eaſed, which ſhall not be found hard, if our confeſſion of ſinnes be hartie,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.13.</note> and according to the rules before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: For he can moſt freely make requeſt to God, who can moſt hartily accuſe and complaine of himſelfe. And our praying to God, is but cold and counterfeit, when we be not touched with our owne vilenes, and ſo conſequently,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.3. Pſal. 145.19. Matth. 15.28.</note> the better feele our neceſſities, which wee deſire to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued. But if this be, we ſhall neither pray in lip-labour, which God abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.1.</note> nor thinke our ſelues too good to waite Gods leaſure, if at firſt hee graunt not our requeſts, but continue them as he commandeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond thing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</note>The ſecond is, that we aske of God no other things, then by his word he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> alloweth vs to pray for, and therefore are agreeable to his will; and ſuch as we haue a promiſe to obtaine, and that in ſuch ſort, as hee hath promiſed them:<note place="margin">1.

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 13.14. &amp; 15.7. &amp; 16.24.</note>
                  <hi>that if we aske any thing according to his will, he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs.</hi> Which rule, as it ſuffereth vs not to hunt after our owne deſire and will: ſo it is no ſmall benefit, that whatſoeuer we ſtand in neede of, asking it according to his will, it ſhall be giuen vs. And who would deſire to haue that, which our louing and moſt prouident father doth not ſee good for vs? which if it content not ſome, marke what they get thereby: For <hi>they aske, but they obtaine not, becauſe they aske amiſſe:</hi> and further, they loſe all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in praying, thinking themſelues good Chriſtians if their lips be going, when God in the meane ſeaſon, counteth their ſuppoſed deuotion to be but much babling,<note place="margin">The third thing in requeſt.</note> being done in ignorance of his will. From this ſecond, ariſeth the third, that ſeeing wee haue ſo great incouragement, ſo preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes of ſo many and great good things, as God hath bequeathed to vs;<note place="margin">Iam. 16.</note> therefore wee ſhould quicken our ſelues to come in faith and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and oft times and cheerefully to this dutie. Euen as men doe come cheerefully, and with good hope goe to their approoued neighbours in their neceſſities to borrow, when they haue often promiſed them to lend. And no maruaile it is though there be both ſeldome praying, and vntoward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> going about it, where faith is wanting to ſet them forward, and aſſurance of obtaining, to bring them on, with comfort. And in great wiſedome and loue, hath God giuen vs leaue to reioyce in making our prayers to him, by this beleeuing, that we ſhall receiue ſomewhat thereby (according to that which he ſaieth in Saint <hi>Iohn:</hi>

And if we be not ſo fully reſolued of this, for want of experience, that both we ought, and may with cheerefulnes come to pray, and with gladnes be occupied in it (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> he is our moſt louing and deare father, who cannot forget nor put off kindnes toward vs) then let the effects of prayer, and the fruites that haue been reaped thereby, perſwade vs of it, which are ſuch, as will eaſily drawe vs with delight to vſe it, though by the fleſh, wee be as with cords haled back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.<note place="margin">Three effects of prayer.</note> Of the which effects of it, I will briefly ſet downe ſome, and they are eſpecially three.</p>

Reuel. 3.10.</note> that by prayer wee are made acquainted (a great word to ſpeake) yea and in a ſort familiar with God, and know his minde and will, and how he is affected to vs, being admitted to ſpeake to him. The ſecond is, that it giueth life to Gods graces in vs, which before lay in vs halfe dead;<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> as faith, hope, care of dutie, vntill by the bellowes of prayer they bee reuiued in vs: for we are dull, forgetfull, vnprofitable, faint in hope, and our comfort dimmed ofttimes; when yet in, and after prayer, wee are well refreſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, euen as the fire is quickned by blowing: as in that worthie example of Queene <hi>Eſter</hi> is to be ſeene; who being timorous (as we may gather) before prayers made to God, was mightily incouraged and ſtrengthened <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> after prayer, in a moſt weightie matter. The third effect of prayer is,<note place="margin">The third.</note> that it reacheth out to vs in our greateſt neede, the good things and gifts of God which our ſoules deſire; as it is written: <hi>Aske, and it ſhall be giuen you:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 7.7.</note> yea ſuch things, as we thought ſometime had not been to be looked for: <hi>ioy in heauines, light in darkenes, and hope for deſpaire,</hi> as by the ſong of <hi>Anna</hi> 1.

Sam. 1.10.<note place="margin">The fourth thing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</note> But I will end with fourth and laſt propertie of prayer; that when we pray wee bring not with vs the ſinnes, which will turne away the eares of the Lord from hearing vs. And theſe ſinnes are any which be not repented of, but lien in, or nouriſhed in vs, ſecretly at the leaſt, and not renounced:<note place="margin">Prou. 28.9.</note> This <hi>Salomon</hi> confirmeth in theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> few words when hee ſaith, <hi>Who ſo turneth away his eare from hearing the law,</hi> (and ſo any part of it,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 7.4.</note> being of like and equall authoritie) <hi>euen his prayer ſhall be abhominable.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> agreeth with him ſaying, euen as he powred out his requeſts vnto God, <hi>if there be any wickednes in my hands</hi> (for all my prayer) <hi>ſhall that excuſe me, ſhalt not thou, O Lord, finde it not?</hi> But when our requeſts ſhall be made to God with theſe properties (for in ſuch manner doth God require them to be offered vnto him) the Chriſtian who obſerueth them, ſhall reape no ſmall fruite thereby: whether he intreate for remiſſion of his ſinnes, or for any good thing whereof he ſtandeth in neede, or againſt any calamitie or burthen, wherewith he ſhall be diſtreſſed; yea he ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> preuaile with God for others, as for himſelfe: and what incouragement thinke we doth this adde to a godly life?</p>
               <p>But when all theſe three parts of Gods worſhip now ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.8.9.10. 1. Sam. 7.7.</note> ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently and humbly be adioyned together, I meane thankſgiuing, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, and requeſt (which ordinarily in our prayers ought to goe one with the other) how much more gainefull (thinke we) are they to the poore Chriſtian ſoule? eſpecially ſeeing by confeſſion of ſinnes, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth himſelfe a guiltie perſon, and debter to God, that ſo he may be the ſlower to runne further in debt with him. By making his ſuites, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that he is a begger, and ſtandeth in neede of all things, as hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of his owne (if he know himſelfe well) but ſinne and filthines, Reuel. 3.17. and by giuing thankes he confeſſeth, that whatſoeuer he hath, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth, he receiueth it of God. All of them make him to ſee himſelfe infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indebted vnto the Lord: his pride to be abated: his heart ſtirred vp to ſeeke vnto him, and inlarged to loue and obey him. And if <hi>he be fallen, this prayer of faith will raiſe him vp:</hi> if he be heauie, this will comfort him: if he be dull, this will quicken him. Oh, who can reckon vp the infinit and maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

               <p>Therefore I conclude, that ſeeing it is a preſent remedie to the oppreſſed heart, a preſeruer of the godly minde, a giuer of ſtrength to the weake, an eſpeciall meanes to make a man fit to liue in euery eſtate, wherein God hath ſet him, &amp;c.

               <p>But the bookes which are to be read, are the holy canonicall ſcriptures, and other ſound and godly authors, as I haue ſaid.<note place="margin">The <hi>4.</hi> rule.</note> Wherein this as a fourth rule is to bee obſerued, that in the reading of the Scriptures, they reade not here and there a chapter (except vpon ſome good occaſion) but the bible in order throughout, and ſo, as oft as they can; that ſo by little and little they may be acquainted with the hiſtories, and the whole courſe of the ſcriptures (hauing before the grounds of Chriſtian religion layd) and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſo may haue the more comfortable and liberall vſe of them.</p>
               <p>And in reading of other good bookes, they are to be counſelled rather to reade ſome one or two well penned, either of the whole Chriſtian religion, or any particular argument, &amp; matter, and them often, rather then a leafe of one and a chapter of another, as idle readers vſe to doe for nouelties ſake. Often, I ſay, becauſe a good book is of the moſt part of Chriſtians little ſeene into, at once or twice reading ouer, much leſſe the vſe of the doctrine of it reaped and inioyed of dull heads, ſlipperie memories, and weake practiſers, ſuch as it is too well knowne, that the moſt Chriſtians are.

               <p>Now as concerning the manner of reading;<note place="margin">Rules more particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reading.</note> it muſt bee with an heartie good will to learne and profit thereby, deſiring God to prepare vs with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: to lighten our vnderſtandings, that we may conceiue that which we reade, and ſetling our ſelues for the time of our reading to be attentiue, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſo to abandon the wandring of the heart, as much as may be: the which will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be the eaſilier done in reading, if it be well watched ouer (as hath been ſaid before) in our courſe of liuing. Alſo it is duly to bee regarded, that wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> applie that which we reade,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note> wiſely to our ſelues (ſeeing all that is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the Scriptures, <hi>is written for our inſtruction and comfort</hi>) as perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our ſelues that all precepts of dutie and good life, are ſet downe to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs (not others onely) to the practiſe of the ſame: that all ſinne is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden vs, and that all the generall promiſes which we reade to be made to the Church, are to bee beleeued of vs, whether they appertaine to this preſent life, or to the life to come; and the comforts that accompanie them.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, that all exhortations and admonitions quicken and ſtirre vs vp from coldnes, deadnes, and drouſines: and all reprehenſions to checke vs for faults eſcaped: and all threats to feare our boldnes, and appale our ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which is too eaſily and readily kindled in vs, that ſo wee may make that vſe of them, which the Apoſtle requireth when he ſaith, <hi>that all Scripture is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by inſpiration of God, and is profitable to teach, conuince, to correct, and inſtruct in righteouſnes:</hi> and thereof in matters as well concerning God as men; and amongſt men, all particular kinds: and therefore Prince and ſubiect, noble and baſe, men and women: and more particularly in families, husbands and wiues; parents and children, maſters and ſeruants.

                  <note place="margin">Two obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about reading.</note>And herein theſe two things, I thinke meete to adde, in regard of ſome Chriſtians; that ſuch as haue not the gift of reading, may endeuour to follow the foreſaid rules,<note place="margin">The firſt.</note> by vſing the helpe of others: exhorting all by their loſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and diſcommoditie to haue reading in greater reckoning, then it is with moſt at this day.<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> The ſecond is, that beſides the former rules, ſuch as haue better helpes of vnderſtanding, memorie and leaſure, doe, beſides their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like hearing, note their doubts, and as they ſhall haue opportunitie, ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of them, at their learned paſtors hands, or of ſome others: and mark the coherence of the Scripture, how it hangeth together: and the agreement that one place hath with another, that thereby that which ſeemeth darke in one, is made eaſie in another. This ſhall ſuffice to haue ſaid, for making ſome better vſe of reading, then commonly men doe. And though there are other things beſides theſe, which the learneder may take profit by: yet they being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> more out of the reach of the greateſt number of Chriſtians, they doe not ſo neerely nor neceſſarily concerne them. And it muſt bee remembred, that I propround not to ſay, as much as may bee gathered together about reading, but how it may bee profitably vſed to helpe the Chriſtian to be fruitfull in a godly life. And that which I haue ſaid, is auaileable thereunto.</p>
               <p>For hee that ſhall conſider, how many waies the conſcience is appeaſed, the iudgement inlightened and inlarged, the heart perſwaded, the memorie relieued, the affections moued; and in a word, the whole man drawne by that which he may reade, ſhall not neede to doubt how great the benefit of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, together with the other helpes, is. And that it being vſed as oft as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> it may, in ſuch manner as hath bin preſcribed, and ſo many good things drunke in and receiued of vs, as wee ſhall meete with in our reading; who doubteth but it ſhall be a ſingular helpe and furtherance with the reſt, to a godly and Chriſtian life? For a mind well ſeaſoned before, ſhall be vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly better ſeaſoned and refreſhed, when it ſhall vſually and oft <hi>drinke of the water of life,</hi> out of the ſweete fountaine of Gods word by reading.

And theſe are eſpecially two: firſt, ſolemne thankſgiuing: and ſecondly, faſting, with prayer more then vſuall adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.<note place="margin">The firſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie help; is ſolemne thankeſgiuing. VVhat it is.</note> The firſt is when in ſome rare and vnlooked for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance out of deſperate danger, wee doe by the commaundement of God, and examples of the godly before vs, in a moſt feruent manner, yeeld praiſe to God for the ſame, and reioyce heartily in the remembrance and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it, tying our ſelues (as it were) in a renuing of our holy couenant, more firmely to the Lord, and teſtifie both theſe by ſignes of vnfained good will to our brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> All which are to be ſeene moſt cleerely and liuely in that famous example of <hi>Heſter</hi> and <hi>Mardocheus,</hi> that I mention no other, for breuitie ſake:<note place="margin">An example of it.</note> who being with the reſt of Gods people in thoſe countries, marked out, and as ſheepe appointed, by <hi>Hamans</hi> ſubtiltie and cruell malice, to be ſlaine; did yet by prayer and faſting obtaine deliuerance, when to mans iudgement,<note place="margin">Eſter 4.16. &amp; 9.1.</note> all hope was paſt: and not that onely, but alſo their hearts deſire againſt their aduerſaries, with great fauour of the King (whom God had made of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie enemie a mightie friend) and much wealth and proſperitie: whereupon they cauſed a day and time to be appointed,<note place="margin">Eſter 9.18, 21.</note> in the which the Lord might be praiſed; and they might expreſſe their reioycing, <hi>and ſend portions one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to teſtifie their loue vnto them.</p>
               <p>And this is that ſolemne thankſgiuing, which I call one of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie helpes to ſet vs forward in godlines:<note place="margin">It is to be vſed according to the occaſion.</note> which of all Gods people by the like occaſion is to be offered vp to God, differing (as ye ſee) apparantly from this dutie daily performed, as in feruencie of the ſpirit; ſo in other ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: beſide a longer time of continuing the ſame.<note place="margin">Publikely.</note> This dutie (when the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it, belonging to a whole Church, is publikely performed) ought to be accompanied with the preaching of the word, to quicken the aſſemblie to the more liuely profeſſing of their thankfulnes, accordingly as their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feaſts vnder the law, were with an holie conuocation. And if the cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of this extraordinarie helpe be priuate concerning ſome one perſon alone,<note place="margin">Or priuatly.</note> or a familie, or ſome few, then it is to bee offered in priuate of them (whom this great benefit concerneth) with Pſalmes, and praiſings of his name, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his workes, and reading Scriptures tending to that end: as Pſal. 105.<note place="margin">Scriptures fit for it.</note> 106.107.</p>
               <p>And becauſe I finde one place very fit for this purpoſe, which teacheth a moſt right manner of the practiſe of this dutie, whether we ſhall be occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:16851:160"/>
publikely or priuately to doe the ſame, I thought it very expedient here <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to put in the ſame: which manner of praiſing God was appointed by the man of God, <hi>Dauid,</hi> at the ſetting vp of the Arke of God in the tabernacle. Some of the words are theſe: <hi>Praiſe the Lord, and call vpon his name; declare his workes among the people:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Chron. 16.8. to 16. &amp; 29.10. to 15.</note> 
                  <hi>ſing vnto him, ſing praiſe vnto him, talke of all his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes: Reioyce in his holy name: let the hearts of them that ſeeke the Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce.</hi> And this of ſolemne thankſgiuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>traordinarie helpe is faſting. What it is.</note>The other extraordinarie helpe is faſting, ioyned with moſt feruent prayer. And this is a moſt earneſt profeſſion of deepe humbling our ſelues, in abſtinence with confeſſion of ſinnes and ſupplications (for the greateſt part of the day at the leaſt) to God, to turne away ſome ſore calamitie from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> vs, or for obtaining of ſome eſpeciall bleſſing. This deſcription in few words I will lay open for their cauſe, who perhaps haue not read nor heard much of this exerciſe of faſting, neither haue bookes at hand to helpe them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to the right vſe of it: I ſay we muſt be deepely humbled, and make earneſt profeſſion of it, more then in the ordinarie abaſing of our ſelues. For though as oft as we doe pray, and confeſſe our ſinnes, we ought to doe them hartily, and deepely: yet neither in the like continuance of time, nor in the ſame meaſure of feruencie can they alwayes be, as at and in this exerciſe, they ought to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly I adde, that with this; abſtinencie muſt be adioyned: I meane <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> thereby, that we muſt depriue our ſelues herein of the lawfull pleaſures and liberties of this life, as meates, drinkes (more then for neceſſitie) coſtly appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, earthly dealings (which yet at other times are free for vs, to inioy) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declaring, that we haue by our ſins made our ſelues vnworthie of them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And thirdly, in that I ſay it muſt be done the moſt part of the day, that is, to the end that by this long time of our humiliation and abaſement, our hearts may be more caſt downe, and throughly touched with our diſtreſſed eſtate, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> then in a ſhorter time they are like to be. Fourthly, ſupplications, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our ſuites and confeſſion of ſinnes, are added, to teach vs, that the chiefe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> part of this exerciſe conſiſteth therein. Fiftly, in that this is done for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of ſome great calamitie,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 20.6.</note> that is to be vnderſtoode, either of ſome ſore affliction outwardly hanging ouer vs, or the whole Church, or alreadie vpon vs; or for ſome greeuous ſinne committed, or long lien in of vs. The which when weaker meanes remooue not from vs, theſe are inioyned vs of the Lord,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.18. 2. Cor. 12.9.</note> to deliuer vs from them, wholy or in part, or elſe to ſtay vs, that we may reſt our ſelues on God, <hi>that his grace ſhall be ſufficient for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here we muſt know, that to be required, which I ſaid to be in thankes, whether priuate or publike, that to enable vs to this dutie the rather, we muſt in the one, vſe the benefit of ſermons, and fit ſcriptures to ſtirre vs vp hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and in the other to meditate of the like ſcriptures priuately, for the well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> carrying of our ſelues through that ſo weightie a buſines: but in both, let this be regarded, that we take them not in hand, except we come in true and vnfained repentance, which as ſurely, as we bring thither: ſo ſure we may be, that God will be with vs there, and heare vs, which will make the whole action more ſauorie,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 20.12.13.27.28.</note> and the end of it to be with comfort, which is the right manner of taking it in hand. Now therefore the nature and qualitie of this
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:16851:160"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> exerciſe being in ſome ſort laid out vnto vs, as the former was, if we duly weigh the force and vſe of them both in their proper kind, namely, how the one raiſeth vs to a ioyfull recording of Gods wonderfull kindnes: the other bringeth vs loue, for our owne vilenes, more eſpecially remembred: both of them doe exceedingly draw our hearts in more loue and obedience to God, who can deny, that they both, in the time, wherein they are to be vſed euen as a long time after, are moſt effectuall meanes to ſet vs forward in the godly life?</p>
               <p>To ſay more of the meanes and helps, I haue not thought it expedient. Therefore to end this whole treatiſe of the helps, theſe few cautions I would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> wiſh to be had of thee, the diligent reader,<note place="margin">Cautions how to vſe the helps mentioned in this treatiſe.</note> (to the end thou maieſt haue the right vſe of them) namely to vnderſtand them well, and conſider throughly of them, and of the commoditie, which they may bring: and ſo with a quiet and meeke heart ſet vpon them, in that manner that thou haſt them ſet downe vnto thee: And incourage thy ſelfe hereunto by this reaſon, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome one of them hath ſo great force, to the wel framing of the heart and life (each in his kinde) then all of them together, being ſo vſed, muſt needes bring a more large and liberall bleſſing that way.<note place="margin">Haue them in high account.</note> But as they are pretious and haue an excellent end, ſo hold ſtill that account and eſtimation of them, and vſe them with all high reuerence, as frailtie will permit,<note place="margin">Vſe them not for faſhion.</note> and not for faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>(as the counſell of fleſh will be) to make the beſt things vile and common in a ſhort time. Neither giue place to wearines and ſlacknes in vſing of them,<note place="margin">Vſe them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</note> either in the firſt entrance, or after longer continuance: yet if by vnawares, or any other way, theſe faults eſcape, be diligent and readie to eſpie them,<note place="margin">If they waxe vnſauoury, giue no place to ſuch deceit, but mone to God for the former grace.</note> and hide them not, but checking thy corrupt heart, confeſſe it to the Lord in ſecret, and he will heare thee and forgiue thee; and then ſet vpon the vſe of the forementioned helps, freſhly and ſauourly againe as thou diddeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow that I haue ſhewed who is a true beleeuer, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> next, deſcribed the godly life, in the ſecond part of this booke; and haue ſet downe laſt of all, the helps and meanes by which a Chriſtian groweth in the ſame: it might ſeeme that any ſeruant of God hauing theſe three before him, ſhould neede no other directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to helpe to the practiſing of this godly life, but might eaſily doe the ſame. And ſo ſhould I thinke (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing been once of that minde) but that I haue perceiued by diligent mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and experience,<note place="margin">This treatiſe is neceſſarily to be ioyned with the former.</note> that it is ſeldome ſeene and hardly found ſo. Generally (I confeſſe) it is obtained: but particularly it is with them, as with the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> who hauing learned what is a good medicine for a daungerous ſore, can lay it to; but hauing not particular skill how to prepare the ſore, how to diet the partie, and when and how to apply the medicine, doth long keepe him at one ſtay, or ſometime better, ſometime worſe, but healeth him not; neither doth by degrees bring it to any good eſtate: ſo the Chriſtian who hath onely ſome knowledge how and by what meanes he muſt growe in godlines, <hi>and reſiſt the diuell,</hi> and ouercome his ſinne, ſhall finde it hard and awke in particulars, and on one day as well as another to doe it with peace, except hee haue full reſolution as well as knowledge and skill how, to vſe and apply the meanes euery day to the diligent obſeruing of his wayes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> both at home and abroade, that he may haue the teſtimonie of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and reioycing thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The generall ſumme of this treatiſe.</note>And this is it, which I meane in this treatiſe, to acquaint the reader with, namely, that the godly life, which is to be continued by the many helps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet downe, is neither left to men ſometime to be practiſed, and at other times may be neglected, nor generally (which is far off from Gods meaning
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:16851:161"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and will) but particularly in al their actions, and euery day, and throughout the day, to bee looked vnto and regarded. This is my meaning, and that which I ayme at in this preſent treatiſe: which is thought of many to be too ſtrict a tying of men to dutie, who are ſo giuen to ſeeke carnall libertie: and it is counted ſtrange that they ſhould be holden within bounds euery day and hower, who are not wont to call themſelues to any great account through the whole weeke or more: who if they be reprooued neuer ſo iuſtly once in a yeere; for it is to be feared, that few reproofes are vſed (to ſuch a point the world is come) they count them nice and too holie which rebuke them, they are ſo little vſed to it: Will they not (thinke we) ſtraine hard to caſt off this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> yoke of watching and obſeruing their liues, and (as they ſhall ſee cauſe) to finde fault with themſelues throughout euery day?</p>
               <p>I haue had experience how hardly ſuch haue been able to heare a kinde and friendly rebuke for fooliſh ieſting, ſwearing, vnſeemely talking, &amp;c. but they haue counted it preciſenes: there is no doubt, but they will impatient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare it, to haue their whole bad courſe controuled and brought within compaſſe.<note place="margin">Some good Chriſtians thinke ſtrange to be held in compaſſe euery day.</note> It is out of queſtion therefore (I ſay) that both ſuch as I haue here ſpoken of, and many better then they, and which haue the Chriſtian life in more reuerence, then many ſuch, hauing giuen themſelues much libertie in their liues, will thinke it ſtrange that euery day care ſhould be had ouer their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hearts and waies. But why thinke they ſo; but for that partly through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſecuritie, and partly through cuſtome in both, they haue long bin eſtranged and held backe from it, and ſo are vnacquainted with it? Alſo they ſee few examples to leade them to it. Among whom, yet (God be bleſſed) there are ſome, yea numbers, I am well aſſured, who if they knew better, would imbrace it.</p>
               <p>Such therefore, as are readie to caſt any miſts of fleſhly obiections before the eyes of the ſimple, and moſt of all to put out their owne light, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be hindred from ſeeing the pathway of this chriſtian direction, to the end they may not walke in it, I exhort to heare me patiently: To whom, as to all other who ſhall regard it, I offer a cleerer knowledge of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> will of God, which hath long been ſmothered by the bold contempt of ſome, and a ſafer way to their owne happines, then is commonly found of the moſt Chriſtians, that is, that as I ſaid, they muſt euery day looke to their waies and liues, and ſettle themſelues conſtantly therein, and not think they doe well till they doe ſo, but hold it for a great offence to God and a bold tempting of him (howſoeuer they offer him ſome manner of ſeruice:) and therefore ſhall pay deare for it, when they dare let any one day in the weeke paſſe by them without good regard had of pleaſing God.</p>
               <p>This was the principall end of my writing,<note place="margin">The end why this treatiſe was written.</note> euen to helpe to bring the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Chriſtian life into practiſe, and conſequently into price and eſtimation with profeſſors; yea with ſome good perſons and people, more then it is. For though in word many profeſſe themſelues followers of Chriſt, and that they ought ſo to doe; <hi>yet with their deedes they denie him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1.16.</note> 
                  <hi>and the power of godlines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</hi> And likewiſe though the Chriſtian life be in ſome account with others, yet it commeth to paſſe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that it is not in chiefeſt reckoning with them aboue other things, without the which it is neuer practiſed to any purpoſe. Which
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:16851:162"/>
is one great cauſe, why both many weake Chriſtians are not better then they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> be, and why the bad and vnreformed perſons pleaſe themſelues in their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and looſe eſtate, and make ſo ſlow haſte (as they doe) to amend and be changed.</p>
               <p>For they ſee in many hot profeſſors, that there is no euen and conſtant courſe kept in the practiſe of godlines one time as wel as another, and in one thing as in another. Generally we ſay all (as I ſet downe before) wee muſt liue godly:<note place="margin">Few doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to liue godly euery day</note> but in particular the godly life is ſeldome and hardly found, euen amongſt thoſe who ſay ſo. And as for any certaine time when this ſhould be practiſed (as no time ſhould be free from ſome part of it) though wee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that it ſhould be ſo to the end of our life, it is ſo little conſidered, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> is moſt cleere that ſundrie euen good men do ſhine but dimmely, &amp; are too often times, yea and too groſſely, out of the way. And as there are many which doe not honour God by a good conuerſation (as they know they might) if they would bend themſelues to it (for this point <hi>of wiſedome is eaſie to him that would vnderstand,</hi> Pro. 8.9) ſo a great number (who gladly would) cannot tell how to goe about it.</p>
               <p>For many a one may approoue of a Chriſtian life, and giue good precepts to another, finding them in the word, which he neuer followed nor practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his owne life. And thus, whiles it is not found nor ſeene by experience, what is the beautie, fruite, and comfort of this Chriſtian life, but amongſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> few, and they for the moſt part not of credit with the men of the world, to perſwade that which they know, it lieth dead in a manner: and ſo Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding kindnes in appointing vs ſuch an happie and ſweet way to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, is not onely not enioyed, but of the moſt counted weariſome and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.<note place="margin">Note.</note> I ſay more, it is vile and in no reckoning nor account with many, without which they forgoe a great part of their happines. It is not miſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, nor asked after, though it be the beſt of all other.</p>
               <p>It might worthily grieue him who knoweth the gaine, beautie, ſweetnes, and honour of it, to ſee ſo many hunt after all theſe, where they cannot bee come by; and if they bee attained, yet as a flower they ſoone fade and are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> gone: and to beſtow no labour for them, where they may all be had, and conſtantly kept and enioyed. And whereas it is graunted, that <hi>one day in the godly life is better then a thouſand elſewhere:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 84.10. Prou. 8.11.18.</note> yet what curteſie is amongſt men who ſhould begin to make proofe of it? and what holding backe is there, leaſt they ſhould doe too much? And therefore that this Chriſtian life may be brought into ſome more eſtimation and reckoning with men, then for a long time it hath been with the moſt, I haue taken ſome little paine to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and lay out this happie eſtate, and to teach a more ſound vſe of it, then the moſt that profeſſe, haue acquaintance with, by ſhewing how it is to bee made an euery daies worke, and to be brought into daily practiſe, that ſo the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> whole being ſeene in her parts, euery thing in it may be better perceiued and diſcerned, with the manifold priuiledges and benefits thereof; as a great houſe,<note place="margin">A ſimile.</note> when the ſeuerall roomes of it, are with their furniture particularly viewed, and not confuſedly beheld.</p>

               <p>And firſt to ſhew, that Gods word doth direct the Chriſtian beleeuer, how hee ſhould liue euery day (and therefore that it is to bee knowne and practiſed) all that liſt,<note place="margin">The firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, conſiſting of proofes out of the word. <hi>1.

                  </note> may eaſily ſee, by that which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> writeth, namely, <hi>that we (who call God father) ſhould paſſe the whole time of our dwelling here in feare:</hi> and that we <hi>ſhould ſpend as much time as remaineth of our life, not after the luſt of men, but after the will of God.</hi> Now therefore if we bee commaunded to liue in the feare of God and according to his will, <hi>the whole time of our dwelling here,</hi> vnto our end; then are we commaunded to doe this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> euery part of this whole time; and conſequently euery day, and throughout the day,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.12.</note> as we may attaine to it: Whereunto belongeth that which is written to the Hebrewes 3.12. <hi>Take heede that there be not at any time, in any of you an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill heart,</hi> therefore not any day.</p>
               <p>To the which moſt liuely agreeth that which wee reade in the ſong of <hi>Zacharias</hi> the father of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 1.75.</note> Luke 1.74.75. who teſtifieth that, <hi>God had ſworne that he would grant vnto vs, that we being deliuered out of the hands of our enemies might ſerue him in holines and righteouſnes before him all our dayes without feare.</hi> By all which it followeth, that we ſhould cal in our hearts and affections from carrying vs diſordredly, and againſt dutie euery day; and in one day as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> well as another to conſecrate our ſelues to God, and according to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to walke with him, whatſoeuer our workes, dealings, or buſines be, that therein wee may keepe our peace with him, and declare that we feare and honour him thereby: which is it, that I contend for, and ſeeke to drawe Gods people vnto, and would thinke I had obtained a great matter at their hands, if we agreed and conſented herein.</p>
               <p>For it is too manifeſt, that this is farre off from the very perſwaſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,<note place="margin">Many, if God be publikely worſhipped on the ſabboth looke no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> who are yet to be hoped well of, and yet reſt in this, that ſo as the ſabboth be paſſed in religious exerciſes, it is not ſo great a matter, if the other dayes be parted betwixt God and them: I meane, they looke not to be called to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſo narrow a reckoning, as to ſee their words and workes, eſpecially the thoughts of their hearts, to be framed after the will of God. Nay the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both it ſelfe is farre enough off from being had in due regard, euen of the moſt which goe for Chriſtians, but is ſpent idly and vnprofitably, if not in worldlines or vanitie, eſpecially a great part of it, euen almoſt as much of it, as is free from publike exerciſes; and yet I would euen that part of the day were not iuſtly to be complained of, that men did preſent themſelues reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently before the Lord to their profit <hi>when they come together,</hi> 1.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt let vs proceede to other reaſons: Therefore,<note place="margin">Prou. 10.9. Gal. 6.16. Pſal. 119.9.</note> for further proofe thereof, I ſay, that ſeeing it is commaunded vs in the ſcriptures that we keepe a certaine courſe in ſeruing God, and walke in a certaine and plaine beaten way, namely, after the word; and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſame courſe is commaunded there alſo, to bee daily and euery day: it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth therefore, that the Chriſtian life is a certaine, daily, and euery dayes directing of vs in our way, and not an vncertaine, generall,<note place="margin">VVhat is ment by this daily direction.</note> and confuſed liuing according to knowledge when we thinke good. By a certaine directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I meane, not that the ſelfe ſame particular actions and duties ſhould be euery day, but yet all euill auoyded euery day, and ſuch good done as in our calling and life ſhall be occaſioned.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing it is ſo, if wee diſpence with our ſelues to lay aſide this care any day (as though it were allowable before God, and lawfull for vs ſo to doe) euen that libertie taking is our ſinne, and that intermitting of dutie any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſuch day is a breaking off of our courſe, and a going out of the way, euen into croſſe paths and by-wayes; wherein the leaſt danger, is to returne backe againe: Which if it were but the loſſe of one dayes iourney (eſpecially when we goe about any matter of weight) would be no ſmall griefe, eſpecially, when our buſines is weightie and requireth ſpeede; and therefore much more in this Chriſtian courſe, being the high way to heauen, from whence when wee haue ſtrayed willingly, wee cannot eaſily come into the way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but rather goe further to our exceeding hurt and daunger. This with much inconuenience beſides, will follow, if the word of God requiring a daily walking with him after ſuch rules as hee giueth vs, wee notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſhall not regarde them, but walke at randon; and ſome day frame our ſelues thereunto, and ſome day not at all: or one day keepe compaſſe, and another day none: or be well occupied in ſome part of it; and in the other, doe what we liſt.</p>
               <p>But for proofe of both points of this reaſon ſomewhat is to be ſaid, that ſo waightie a matter, and ſo hardly perſwaded to many (namely, that euery day wee are to follow ſome certaine direction for the well ordering of our
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:16851:164"/>
liues througout the ſame) may not depend vpon my bare report and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt poynt therefore, that a Chriſtian muſt bee directed in his whole life,<note place="margin">The proofe of the firſt part of the ſecond reaſon, namely, That a certaine courſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in the word. <hi>Pſal. 119.9.</hi>
                  </note> and therefore may not be left to his owne diſcretion and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that which is written in the Pſalme doth cleerely proue it: when a queſtion was put forth by <hi>Dauid</hi> the man of God in the perſon of a young man (who of all other is hardlieſt kept in order) for the edifying of the whole Church, ſaying: <hi>By what meanes may a young man,</hi> who hath had his ſinnes pardoned, <hi>clenſe his wayes</hi> afterward, that ſo he may be bleſſed? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth the queſtion himſelfe, thus: <hi>Euen by taking heede thereto according to thy word,</hi> O God. And as he taught this in doctrine, ſo he brought his owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> example in the ſeuen verſes following, to ſhew that hee ſought to proue himſelfe happie the ſame way. And this all will graunt, that Gods word muſt be our guide: in generall tearmes this will be affirmed of the moſt, but what is this which they ſay?</p>
               <p>For they obiect through the ignorance that is in them, and other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities carrying them, <hi>as a whirlewinde,</hi> that they are not to bee vrged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this word of God ſo particularly; for it diſtracteth them ſore, but euery man in the ſtate he is in (they ſay) is to carry himſelfe, as he thinkes good in his common actions and buſines: they hope men be no children, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed what they ſhould doe: when yet, God ceaſeth not to ſound this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in our eares continually, 1. Cor. 10. <hi>Whether we eate or drinke, &amp;c.</hi> So that I may well anſwere them that God hath not onely left his Scriptures among vs, to the end we ſhould in ſuch a looſe manner looke after them, and fall into groſſe errors for not knowing them, and ſo become nothing the better for them: but he hath taught vs to draw (as it were) a copie, and a certaine platforme for our liues out of the ſame, the poore, the rich; the old, the young; the married and the vnmarried: all are (I ſay) to draw out of them, direction for their vſe.</p>
               <p>And what other thing is contained in the words of the Prophet? for in ſaying that <hi>we muſt take heede to our wayes,</hi> that is, our courſe of life and the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> actions thereof, doth he except any one more then another? So that it is manifeſt both by the doctrine of the word of God, as alſo by the examples thereof, that not onely there ought to be a generall guiding of Gods people by the word, but alſo a particular trying of their wayes thereby, and that this ought to be as a trade to be followed in one poynt as in another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the knowledge of euery one, and therefore to be made an ordinarie courſe, to ſeeke to haue direction in all things. So that in the more actions of our liues, that we are ignorant and to ſeeke, whether we doe them law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or no; the more wee muſt ſee our debt to God, and finde fault with our ſelues, that we may ſee the greater neede to ſue for pardon, which few <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> doe ſee. And therefore are the particular duties ſet downe almoſt in euery epiſtle, both which all Chriſtians ought to performe, and the contrary ſins, that they may ſee according to the occaſions offered, how to imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and alſo more ſpecially of men and women; old and young; rich and poore; maiſters and ſeruants; both inward affections, and externall actions: all which, to what end ſerue they, or why ſhould they haue been
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16851:164"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſet downe, but to teach this, that men muſt tie themſelues ſhorter, and denie many noyſome liberties, which now they take and runne after: and alſo to teach, that euery part of a Chriſtians life requireth direction, that hee muſt ſhun that which is naturall (I meane his owne) and be guided by that which is ſpirituall, namely, by the word of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is not to be counted as a common ſinne, but as the head of many ſins, that (as though the Scriptures were among vs but for faſhion, or for the deciding of ſome rare and hard doubts, and controuerſies in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is but one vſe of them) the moſt thinke themſelues by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall wit and skill, able to direct their waies: which opinion with their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> what doth it differ from that which is written of the Heathen Gentiles? <hi>God in times paſt ſuffered all nations to walke in their owne waies,</hi> Act. 14.16.

               <p>And as theſe and ſuch like Scriptures doe prooue that a godly life ſhould be alwaies and euery day: ſo in other places of the word, the ſame thing is ſet downe in another manner, as by that in the Pſalme may bee gathered: where the Prophet expreſſeth it by the meanes and helpes, whereby ſuch a life is led,<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.2.</note> that is, by prayer and praiſes, ſaying thus: <hi>euery day,</hi> or according to the Hebrue words, <gap reason="foreign">

               <head>CHAP. 4. Of the third reaſon of the daily direction.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Vrthermore, if ſo many parts of a daily direction, as will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently direct a man, be inioyned in the word of God, to be daily vſed, then a certaine and daily direction is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of God: but the firſt is manifeſt and cleere: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter cannot be denied. Now for proofe of this, that ſo many parts of direction, as may well guide a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian through the day, are ſet downe in the word of God, it is cleere: for we are directed there, how to begin the day, how to proceed in the ſeuerall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame, and how to end it, I exclude not any one. We are directed alſo how to carrie our ſelues in companie, how alone, how at home, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: how to beare troubles when they come, and to prepare our ſelues for them before they come: and how to vſe proſperitie, as health, friends, peace, libertie, goods, and whatſoeuer bleſſings beſides, God ſhall any day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> beſtow vpon vs.</p>
               <p>In al theſe (I ſay) with other ſuch, we are directed in the word of God, and how wee may euery day, as well as ſome one, ſerue God in them, as occaſion ſhall be offered, which ſhall more cleerely bee ſeene afterwards in ſundrie particulars. Which if it be ſo, what ordinary actions in any lawfull calling are to be done of a Chriſtian through the day, but God hath in his word guided him how to doe them, in ſuch wiſe, as hee by the helpe thereof, may with peace and comfort bring it to an end: and contrariwiſe, <hi>he that knoweth his will therein,</hi> and walketh not after the ſame, ſhall neither finde peace in his life, nor happines after. Which, if it were duly weighed and conſidered, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> would keepe Chriſtians in another and that more ſafe, well ordred, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly courſe, then they now are which know it not, or haue not conſcience to ſeeke experience of it: whereas without it, many, who might bring great glorie to God by their liues, and themſelues liue very ſweetly; yet becauſe they are ſtrangers from ſuch a daily courſe keeping, doe neither of both, or at leaſt, very meanely: and yet becauſe they haue no acquaintance with any better, are not content to be diſquieted, and rouſed out of that vnprofitable courſe wherein they are.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I thinke it will be looked for, that I ſhould prooue that by the Scriptures, which I haue ſaid of the parts of the direction, that ſo many as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> may well guide a Chriſtian throughout the day, are as well particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired euery day at our hands to be obſerued, as generally all our life long: I will therefore ſatisfie the teachable reader in that which hee deſireth. And firſt where I ſaid, that we are guided by the word how to begin the day, and how to goe through it; <hi>Salomon</hi> in one ſentence directeth to both: for when he had ſaid,<note place="margin">Prou. 6.22.</note> 
                  <hi>The commaundements and inſtructions ſhould be alwaies bound to our hearts,</hi> that is, had in continuall remembrance, <hi>and tied about our neckes,</hi> that is,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:16851:166"/>
as iewels had in ſpeciall account: hee addeth; <hi>that at our awaking, they ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> talke with vs, and when we walke, they ſhall leade vs.</hi> As if hee ſhould ſay, if the word of God be carefully kept in mind, and held in precious eſtimation, it ſhall guide vs from the morning to the euening, euen from our vpriſing to our lying downe: ſo that, God hath not left the gouerning of our liues in our owne hands, as though hee had taken no order for them, but hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his word how the whole day ſhould be paſſed.</p>
               <p>And further where I ſaid more particularly, that the Chriſtian life, which we are daily to leade, conſiſteth in a carefull <hi>declining from all euill,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe in well liuing, <hi>and bringing forth the fruites of faith and amendment of life:</hi> and alſo in the vſe of ſuch helps and meanes, by which this faith and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> holy life are nouriſhed, and preſerued: It is very true: For there are no meanes neceſſarily to be vſed euery day, nor any parts of godly life, which we are bound to performe daily, but the ſcripture doth particularly require the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vſed daily.<note place="margin">The parts of a godly life to be practiſed daily.</note> That which I ſay of the helps ſhal be proued afterwards. And for the parts of good life, which we muſt needes practiſe daily, they are, that we ſhould be daily occupied in thoſe good workes, which in our place and calling, we can ſee to bee required of vs: as brotherly kindnes, loue, ſobrietie, patience, iuſt dealing towards all, mercifulnes, meekenes, and ſuch like. And theſe be like neceſſarie all the dayes of our life, as in any one; ſo that it is our ſinne, when we doe the contrarie.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, the workes which muſt of neceſſitie be done daily, are to carry our ſelues both in proſperitie, and vnder all bleſſings rightly, that is, cheerefully, thankfully, and fruitfully: and in our afflictions patiently and with contentation. And who doth not know, that theſe both ſhould bee daily?<note place="margin">In proſperitie.</note> For, firſt that praiſes and thankſgiuing in our proſperitie are required to be daily, as long as that eſtate abideth, conſider what the pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>my tongue ſhall talke of thy righteouſnes daily,</hi> Pſalm. 71.24. and that meant Saint <hi>Iames,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.19.</note> Chap. 5.13. <hi>In our proſperitie to ſing praiſes,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhing vs <hi>to giue thankes in all things,</hi> bringeth vs to the ſame dutie euery day.</p>
               <p>And although the word (daily) be not there mentioned, and where he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſaith, <hi>reioyce in the Lord alwayes,</hi> Phil. 4.4. yet who doubteth that he can meane any leſſe then this, when hee ſaith, <hi>in all things:</hi> euen ſuch, as come to paſſe daily and euery day? and yet euen this word (daily) is in other Scripture vſed.<note place="margin">Lam. 3.23.</note> For <hi>as the mercies of God are renewed daily vpon his:</hi> ſo Gods people are in the example of the man of God (whoſe praiſe is ſo great in the Scripture) taught, that as they enioy them euery day; ſo they are euery day to ſound forth his praiſe thankfully and cheerefully, as ſuch who feele and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereby, the exceeding ſweetenes of Gods louing kindnes and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and that is to make the true and right vſe of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In afflictions.</note>And as daily praiſes are to be offered for benefits, ſo muſt the patient and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> right bearing of afflictions bee daily alſo, and earneſt prayers to God made for the remouing of them; as we reade the Prophet <hi>Daniel did daily, and three times in the day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired about afflictions.</hi> Iam. 1.5. 2. Chr. 20.3.4. Lam. 3.27.</note> Dan. 6.10. But about afflictions God requireth theſe two things of vs: the one that we ſhould prepare and make readie our ſelues to beare them as from him, in ſuch quiet manner, as that we be not vnſetled nor troubled at the heart by them, when we heare of them: the other, that when
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:16851:166"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they come, we ſhew our ſelues to be ſuch indeede,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.6.7. 2. Sam. 15.26.</note> and through the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement which we haue from him, we ſubmit our ſelues (euen as our necke vnto the yoke) willingly to goe vnder them. Now though no wiſe man doubts, but that Gods meaning is that we ſhould be patient and obedient in one as well as another, and one time as well as an other; yet that it may plainely be ſeene, it is to be knowne, that both theſe are giuen vs in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement euery day.</p>
               <p>For firſt God hath taught vs in the fourth petition <hi>(giue vs this day our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread)</hi> ſo to pray for all things needefull to this preſent life,<note place="margin">Firſt that we prepare our ſelues for them, before they come.</note> as his moſt wiſe prouidence ſeeth meeteſt and beſt for vs; and therefore if he in wiſedome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> doe ſee afflictions fit for vs, though we are not to pray for them, we offer our ſelues readie to receiue them, and take them as a part of <hi>our daily bread</hi>; or elſe we vnderſtand not what God teacheth vs to pray for, nor what we offer to him in making that prayer. For we deſire of God in it bleſſing fit for the time, wherein we are euery day: and therefore not onely in peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, the bleſſing of thankes, &amp;c. but vnder affliction, patience, contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch like graces, euen <hi>the thing of the day in the day, as Agur</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Prou. 30.8.</note> that is, euery thing in his time, and as the time requireth. For in proſperitie, the time requireth one bleſſing; in affliction another: that ſo wee may hang on God euery moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> By this it may bee ſeene, that Chriſtians ought euery day to prepare for troubles, and that is a ſpeciall part of their dutie in the day.<note place="margin">Second, that we beare them rightly, when they come. <hi>Luk. 9.23.</hi>
                  </note> The other thing about afflictions is, that wee beare them willingly when they come euery day. And this is that which our Sauiour Chriſt teacheth, when he ſaith, <hi>he that will come after me, muſt deny himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe daily:</hi> and this is an other part of our dutie in the day, ſo needfull to be looked vnto, as none more.</p>
               <p>So that God hath taught his, that whether their life be incombred with afflictions, or whether it be paſſed in the vſe, commodities and benefits, they ſhall in both eſtates learne of him how to be directed daily. Yea and to ſhut <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vp this poynt, and make it more full: not onely euery day he hath directed vs how to liue in both eſtates, but euen through the day alſo, according to that which is written by <hi>Moſes</hi> in Deuteronomie:<note place="margin">Deut. 33.12. Matth. 26.41.</note> 
                  <hi>The beloued of the Lord ſhall dwell in ſafetie vnder his protection all the day long.</hi> When Chriſt ſaith <hi>watch and pray, leaſt ye fall into temptation,</hi> what day, or part of the day, doth he war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant vs to be free from daunger, without theſe meanes, as experience alſo ſheweth?</p>
               <p>By theſe things which I haue now ſpoken of, namely, daily to be giuen to euery good worke, and to looke to our ſelues, that both in proſperitie and aduerſitie we be daily well ordered; we ſee that a Chriſtian may be able to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> gouerne himſelfe ſafely through the day, although hee had no further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But yet more particularly the word of God doth direct them how to paſſe the day in their calling, in company, alone by themſelues, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently in all the actions of the day. Which becauſe I haue appointed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to prooue it, and would auoyde tediouſnes in not repeating it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I will deferre it, till I come to the more particular handling of the daily direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:16851:167"/>But yet the meanes and helps, whereby a godly life is preſerued daily,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> as I promiſed before,<note place="margin">Helps to a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life are to be vſed daily.</note> and leaſt I ſhould not ſo particularly handle them in the direction following, I will in few words ſet downe: and ſhew, how God hath inioyned ſo many of them, as doe neceſſarilie helpe to the practiſe of godlines, daily to be vſed; and though not the ſame, yet one or other, as pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, meditation, <hi>exhorting one another,</hi> praiſe and thankes, attending to the publike meanes of the word daily, as oft as we may inioy it. Theſe meanes God doth not onelie inioyne daily to bee vſed, but alſo in ſuch wiſe, as he who weigheth how the commaunding of them daily to be vſed, goeth with the commaunding of the godlie life daily to be continued by the helpe of them, ſhall cleerelie ſee, that God meant not coldlie and ceremoniouſlie to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> haue them performed of vs; but that of them both, a true and holie ſeruing of him daily, ſhould bee framed: that ſo we might be one daie, as another, and not fickle and chaunging alwaies, as otherwiſe we muſt needes be.</p>

               <p>To the ſame purpoſe of daily looking to our waies,<note place="margin">The third.</note> our Chriſtian life is compared <hi>to a courſe or race:</hi> that as they which runne keepe their bounds and courſe, and goe not aſide out of the way: ſo ſhould they who runne in the Chriſtian race, looke before them, and ſee that they keepe in their way, and not runne on vncertainly, or wandring they know not where, whither, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> how, by peruerting their waies.</p>
               <p>It is alſo compared to an high way,<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> in the which if we guide and keep our beaſt, although it be loden, it commeth ſafely to the market with the cariage or burden: but if we ſuffer it to goe out of the plaine way into cartrakes, and to climbe vp to the browes and rough waies, it is caſt and wearied: ſo if we keepe in the knowne and beaten way, we goe on our Chriſtian courſe ſafely, although with ſome difficultie, and with many incombrances: but if wee peruert our way, and goe out of it, by and by we fall into daunger,<note place="margin">Prou. 10.9.

               <p>So it is compared to <hi>a rule, to guide vs:</hi> that as well in our talke with other,<note place="margin">The fift.</note> as alone by our ſelues, in our earthly buſines, as our ſpirituall ſeruice of God: in our affaires abroad, as well as our dealings at home, and in one thing as well as another, we ſhould haue certaine direction for euery part of it.

               <p>The ſame is to be ſaid of other faithfull ſeruants of God,<note place="margin">Gen. 5.22.23. Gen. 6.5.

               <p>So that it is manifeſt, both by the doctrine of the word of God, and alſo by the examples thereof, that not onely there ought to be a generall guiding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Gods people by the word, but alſo a particular trying of their waies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and a framing of them thereto: and that this ought to be as a trade, to be followed in one point as in another, according to the knowledge of euerie one, and therefore to be made an ordinarie courſe of them euery day, to ſeeke to haue direction in all things.</p>

For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all dutie to bee performed of vs, is either to bee ſhewed towards God or men: he to teach vs in what ſort and manner this is to bee done, hath thus ſet downe his will vnto vs, ſaying. Concerning my ſelfe,<note place="margin">A commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall rule to worſhip God by, daily.</note> for the ſixe daies throughout the weeke, yeare, your whole life, worſhip and ſerue me, both inwardlie and outwardlie, as in the three firſt commaundements I haue bound you; and on the ſeuenth daie, as the fourth commaundement inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. And this is your direction in all dutie to me for euer.<note place="margin">And to liue with men daily.</note> Concerning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> men, without any reſpect of any daie or particular time, frame your ſelues daily and alwaies, as the ſixe laſt commaundements doe require. Who doth not ſee, that the Lord, ſetting downe his minde in the commaundements af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, hath of purpoſe ſet downe a perpetuall direction for his people throughout their pilgrimage?</p>
               <p>For though all ſee it not, neither conſider it, what then? <hi>Shall the will of God be of no effect,</hi> becauſe of the ignorance of men? but they who ſee the will and meaning of God aright in them, ſee no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this, that I haue ſaid. Neither let any obiect here, that there is no other direction giuen vs, then generally to follow the commandements for our guide, ſeeing euery commandement is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> to be vnderſtood ſpiritually: and therefore reacheth to all particulars of that kind, yea euen thoſe which are inward. For he ſetteth downe more then that, namely, that both on the ſixe daies and euerie of them, one euen courſe of worſhipping and ſeruing him be vſed and aimed at in our particular actions; and on the ſeuenth daie, another perpetuallie to bee obſerued on the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both for euer, diuers from the former. And becauſe the duties that wee owe to men are in the ſixe laſt commaundements indifferentlie, on all the ſeuen daies to be performed: therefore indifferentlie on the one, as well as on the other (and not at our pleaſure when wee liſt, or as we thinke good) our care to practiſe and faithfullie endeuour after them, is to bee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and ſo the contrarie ſinnes in like ſort are to be renounced. Now in that many of Gods people ſee it not to be thus, nor make any ſuch vſe of it, it is by reaſon of their ignorance of Gods will in the commaundements, and vnwillingnes to take paine about the ſame, and vnacquaintance with a daily endeuouring and ſetting themſelues to the particular practiſing of dutie in euery commaundement, according to their knowledge, as euery one hath heard the ſame laid open vnto him.</p>

This daily direction then of a Chriſtian,<note place="margin">A deſcription of this daily direction.</note> is a gathering together of certaine rules out of Gods word, by which we may be enabled euery day to liue according to the will of God, with ſound peace: and therefore the following of ſuch direction is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and conſtant indeuour to pleaſe God in all things euery day, as long as we liue here to the peace of our conſcience, and to the glorifying of him. Let this deſcription be opened more plainely, and then I will ſet downe the parts thereof. And before I go further, I thinke meete to giue the Reader to vnderſtand, that I ſet not downe this, as preſcribing any other direction, then Gods word hath taught: but whereas through common ignorance and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> negligence in obſeruing that which God hath taught, the moſt do faile, this may be an helpe to bring them to ſee the light, after which they ought to walke. It is firſt called an indeuour to pleaſe God, to teach vs, that neither full perfection is required by God, nor to be looked for in the beſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor to be thought that it is intended of me to feare any weake conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with it, or thruſt it vpon him; but onely to ſhew, that the will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the heart, and the indeuour of the life in the beleeuer, is accepted of him through Chriſt, and as well pleaſing to him, as our actions themſelues ſhould be, when they cannot be performed. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.</p>
               <p>And if it were not ſo, what comfort could we haue, who ſee daily, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> we are holden backe from many duties, which yet becauſe we know we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire with all our hearts, and ſtriue to performe them, we haue peace to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? And thus are the places to be vnderſtood, which make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the commaundements, that <hi>they are bleſſed which keepe them,</hi> as Pſal. 119.2. and .8. Luc. 11.28. <hi>Bleſſed are they which heare the word of God and keepe the ſame</hi>: as is to be ſeene by conference of other places, as 1. Chron. 28.7. <hi>If Salomon thy ſonne ſhall indeuour to keepe my commandements, I will esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his kingdome for euer:</hi> And in Hoſea, 6.3. <hi>then ſhall we indeuour our ſelues to know the Lord.</hi> In which places, the keeping of Gods commaundements is interpreted by the holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures, to be an indeuouring to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> know and keepe them. And this indeuor is euery day neceſſarily to be found in vs to pleaſe God, euen as euer we did any day, neither can it be neglected of vs at any time but God is offended.</p>
               <p>For it is a neare companion to the feare of God, euen a fruite of it, which muſt be in our hearts continually.<note place="margin">Prou. 23.17.</note> Which is to be marked the rather, for that we ſee how commonly it is neglected many dayes of Chriſtians, and how they thinke it meere bondage to be tyed to this care of looking to their waies, without which yet,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.41.</note> they lye open to all the craft and malice of the diuel, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken of him at his will.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.14.</note> And therefore it is, that when the Apoſtle hath charged the Epheſians to take vnto themſelues <hi>the whole armor of God,</hi> he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>that they must ſtand faſt in it, and giue</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And although through infirmitie, which is in the beſt,<note place="margin">Although through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie we come ſhort, yet much eaſe ſhall vve find in ſeruing God, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing direct.</note> they ſhall neuer fully reape the fruite, which the rules do leade vnto, for they faile through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ouer-ſight, raſhneſſe, and by other naturall corruption are much feebled, and therefore muſt needs come ſhort in performing duty, as they ought: yet through the grace that God giueth his, they find and ſtill may obtaine by the helpe hereof, ſuch eaſe in the ſeruing of God through the day, as they thought before impoſſible, and neuer looked to inioy, that they may truly ſay, notwithſtanding the <hi>ſinne that cleaueth to them,</hi> that they haue oft moſt ſweete communion with God, and hold their ſinne in great ſubiection to their admiration, which was wont full ſore to imbondage them.

Now then, when his poore ſeruants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> come to know his mind, and will in them, and how he is affected to them: yea which is more, when they ſhall be further inſtructed, that his will is, that they ſhould daily occupie their minds in thinking of theſe and ſuch like things, is it any great maruell if they grow more heauenly minded, and be more conſtantly ſetled in an holy courſe? and ſo become acquainted with the practiſe of duty more vſually and continually then they were wont, when either they know not that any ſuch thing was required of them daily, or how to bring their hearts daily to like of it?</p>
               <p>And when they ſhall be well and throughly perſwaded (whatſoeuer the wandring and inconſtant courſe of the moſt be) that God requireth of them,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that euery day they ſhall warily ſhunne euill, waite to honor him in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per duties and ſeruice, which they owe to him, &amp; count it their chiefe worke to do ſo daily: to pray oft, and to ſpeake to him in thankſgiuing, daily renew their faith, and hope of ſaluation, and other temporall fauours of his; when, I ſay, they ſhall ſee that God commeth thus neare to them, whiles they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from him here on earth, and offereth them this familiaritie <hi>as his friends,</hi> and not vſing them <hi>as ſeruants,</hi> is it to be maruelled at, that they accept of it daily? and when they haue taſted once, that this may be their vſuall and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie diet (this ſweete communion with God, I meane, which was wont to be but their feaſting now and then) is it to be thought ſtrange, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſhould reach out their hand to this their welfare?</p>
               <p>No, no: if God once perſwade his, that they may walke in his fauour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie day, and with more acceptation and better welcome, then when they could haue but a ſmall glimſe of it, once in a weeke, moneth or quarter, they will not ſtarue when they may banquet,<note place="margin">Note.</note> they will not eate achornes with ſwine when they may be fed <hi>with Angels foode,</hi> they will not ioy in the company of wicked men,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.23.

               <p>Indeed I deny not, but whiles Gods people are tied ſhort of the cleare knowing their liberties, and are holden in blindneſſe and ignorance of theſe things, as many are, but that they are alſo kept in vnbeleefe, not being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that God affoordeth ſuch liberties to them: and then moreouer, the penury of good examples to go before them herein, do much hinder and hold them backe from inioying their part in them. But who doubts if they knew theſe things, &amp; were perſwaded of them, but that they wold be as ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to heare of this heauenly and happie newes, as they were to haue the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of ſaluation at their firſt calling, as being now better able to diſcerne the beauty of heauenly things then when they firſt beleeued?</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like, which God doth admit his deare children vnto, ſhould be taught them oft, and plainely, and wiſely, and fitly applied to them. Miniſters <hi>ſhould dwell in them</hi>:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.16.</note> and know by themſelues, who haue in a long

               <p>And yet (which is moſt pitifull to thinke) through this, that few are by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and ſincere preaching brought to Chriſt at all by true conuerſion, it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that there are very few, for the moſt part, in one congregation who are fit to heare or be taught this doctrine.

And it was one of the principall things that God meant to teach vs, by the morning and euening ſacrifice, &amp; prayer dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the lawe of ceremonies. But I would all good Chriſtians did as duly and conſcionably perfourme this dutie to God euery day, and bind themſelues reſolutely thereto, as the word of God doth clearely proue that they ought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to do ſo: as for them who may pleaſe themſelues in outward humbling of the bodie, and confeſſion of the mouth; in a word, they muſt know, that the chiefe glorie of it is inward.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point followeth, namely,<note place="margin">The ſecond point.</note> that euery day we ought to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto a cheareful and liuely beleeuing, that our ſinnes thus bewailed,<note place="margin">Forgiueneſſe of ſinne.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and repented of, are forgiuen, and freely remitted vnto vs, for and through the onely and ſufficient ſatisfaction of Ieſus Chriſt. And for the proofe of this, it is ſufficient, that theſe two are neuer parted, but go together, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith: <hi>Repent, and ye ſhall receiue the forgiueneſſe of your ſinnes</hi>: and in <hi>Hoſea</hi> the people were thus taught to ſeeke and come by it:<note place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> 
                  <hi>Returne vnto the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> Lord from your iniquities, and then ſay to the Lord, Take away all our iniquitie,</hi>

                  <hi>and receiue vs graciouſly: and he will heare your rebellion, and loue you freely, for his anger is turned away from you.</hi> And our Sauiour commanded his Apoſtles <hi>to abide in his loue,</hi> euen as they had taſted how ſweet it was.

Beſides, in that the Church of God is taught this for an article of her faith, to beleeue her ſinnes to be forgiuen; and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are firmely and conſtantly to be holden and beleeued, and all vnbeleefe

is ſinne at any time: therefore as we are to be raiſed vp by faith in Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that our ſins are pardoned now, euen ſo we are at other times, and one day as well as another to be ſo vpholden.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> and therefore for euery day, the word (<hi>this day</hi>) is expreſſed, ſeruing for euery day of our life; that wee may know, that there is no day of our life, wherein this prayer in effect is not to be made; no day wherein we pray not for our <hi>daily bread,</hi> euen all neceſſaries for this preſent life: ſo is there no day in which we aske not, and ſo in which we ought not to enioy it by faith, I meane, the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> And if euery morning Gods mercies be renewed,<note place="margin">Lamen. 3.23.</note> of which this is chiefe; then we alſo muſt in the ſame manner imbrace them by faith as our owne, and ſo partake them. So that this bindeth the conſcience alſo as the former, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day the true Chriſtian muſt be perſwaded of the pardon of his ſinnes, and that no day he ſhould looſe his part in ſo great a treaſure, though it is to be feared, that many good Chriſtians enioy it not. Neither indeed can this ſecond rule be faithfully obſerued and kept, but it will cauſe all the other to be well looked too and regarded. Bring we therefore our hearts daily to count it our treaſure, that ſo they may delight in it: (<hi>for where our treaſure is, there will they be alſo</hi>) and then we haue well and wiſely prouided for our ſelues in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that day, and our greateſt toyle is ouer (as they ſay) for the whole day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. And this will be done, if, as it is the greateſt of all other: ſo we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue, that none is greater with vs. To ſpeake more largely of theſe pointes here, is not my purpoſe, for that they haue bene handled before in the firſt and third treatiſe: onely thus much, to referre this beleeuing of pardon to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day. And this is here to be looked for of the reader, that euery one of the points and partes of this daily direction (the which I haue taught in other parts of this booke, how they ſhould be attained and come by) muſt be kept of a Chriſtian euery day.</p>
               <p>The third point is, that when we ſhall be ſtrongly haled after ſinne, (for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> we muſt know that euery day giues occaſion thereof) that we ſo account of the libertie of our hearts and minds,<note place="margin">The third point Preparation and arming of our hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt euill, &amp; readie to good.</note> to keepe them well diſpoſed and armed againſt all ſinne, and moſt of all, our ſpeciall infirmities, that we let them not looſe at any time in the day, to be <hi>hardened</hi> with <hi>the deceitfulneſſe of any ſinne,</hi> but <hi>kept with all diligence poſſsible,</hi> from the loue and liking thereof, that ſo our outward actions may be well ordered. Therefore is that charge giuen in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.12.</note> 
                  <hi>that our hearts be not made nought, and rebellious at any time,</hi> and therefore by conſequent on any day, whiles we ſuffer them <hi>to be hardened with the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne.</hi> And agreable to this, the Lord in Deuteronomie, aunſwering <hi>Moſes</hi> (when he brought him word, that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> people would willingly be ruled by him, although before they refuſed ſo to be) ſaid: <hi>This people hath ſaid well all that they haue ſaid</hi>: but <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 5.29.</note> 
                  <hi>oh that there were an heart in them, that they would feare me, and keepe all my commandements alwaies; then it ſhould go well with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we muſt ſee ſuch neceſſitie of holding maiſterie ouer our hearts, and keeping them in feare of offending, that we may make a daily practiſe of it, and ſo keepe them for continuance: neither can we otherwiſe ſhew our
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:16851:175"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſelues to regard that waightie charge of the Lord giuen vnto vs:<note place="margin">Mat. 22.37.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord with all thy heart and ſoule.</hi> For they who are euery while off and on, vnſetled in their harts, can neuer be long well ordered in their liues:<note place="margin">Prou. 4.18.</note> therefore the Lord requireth this conſtancie, that we muſt euery while be looking to them, euen alwaies, that ſo we may be out of daunger. Behold how needfull a thing this is, to keepe and hold this maiſterie ouer our hearts daily: when nothing goeth well forward, where they with the affections of them be not well ruled. But this ſhall be ſhewed in the next ſection follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Neither let men obiect their neceſſarie buſineſſe (though they will not pleade for carnall libertie, they ſay) and multitudes thereof, which will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> their hearts. I aunſwer, of multiplicitie of earthly dealings, which will hinder holy peace, let wiſe Chriſtians beware: and ſo doing, if (as farre as they are able) they ſet themſelues to haue care of all parts of Chriſtian obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, their hearts ſhall in good manner prouide thereby, for the well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their earthly buſineſſe alſo, which is one part of it, and none of the meaneſt.</p>
               <p>Now from this heart well gouerned,<note place="margin">The <hi>4.</hi> Flee euill,</note> the next two points (as two armes of a tree, from the bodie or ſtocke) do iſſue and come: The firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>5.</hi> Follow good.</note> that we ſhold euer keepe from euill: which ſhall not be hard, if alwaies and euery day we be held in feare of offending, as we are directed before. The ſecond, that we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> alwaies indeuour <hi>to pleaſe God,</hi> and therefore <hi>in all things</hi>; and as was ſaid in Deuteronomie, <hi>to keepe all his commaundements</hi>: which all may ſee, cannot be if we haue not our hearts ſo prepared to ſeeke the Lord, that we may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in one dutie as well as in another, to ſhew our ſelues obedient.<note place="margin">Deut. 5.29.</note> All which three, namely, 1. to haue a heart to feare God, 2. to flie euill, 3. and pleaſe him in all things, in that one Scripture before mentioned are required daily to be found in vs; ſo there is no man but may eaſily ſee reaſon, why it ſhould be thus: firſt, ſeeing the one cannot be without the other: ſecondly, the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of ſuch agreableneſſe betwixt our hearts and liues is our beautie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And on the contrarie, it is moſt harſh and offenſiue, when they which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> beare a faire ſhew, and are content ſomtimes to be gouerned, ſhal yet at other times be nothing ſo.</p>
               <p>I will ſay ſomewhat the more of theſe two, ſeeing it is one of the chiefeſt cauſes, why I entred into this preſent treatiſe, as may appeare by that which I haue alreadie ſaid: namely, that the Chriſtian ſhould be euery day free from all reprochfull euill: inſomuch as if by any occaſion he be turned out of the way, yet he ſhould ſpeedily returne, and alſo that he ſhould be daily <hi>giuen vnto euery good worke,</hi> watching his oportunitie thereto, that ſo he may haue a good conſcience in all things, and may bring foorth much fruite, that God may be glorified. Yet I meane not that he ſhould ſpend the whole day in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> prayer, hearing of Sermons,<note place="margin">A godly life daily, conſiſteth not onely in the exerciſes of religion.</note> or other religious exerciſes (excepting the Sabbath) but in one lawfull thing or other about his calling; or any other in ſtead thereof, which may be as well defended, and as pleaſing to God as the duties of his calling.</p>
               <p>More particularly to appoint or preſcribe is hard,<note place="margin">VVe may ſerue God in our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and meaneſt works.</note> and this is plaine enough for euery true beleeuer to vnderſtand, and apply vnto himſelfe: for I exclude not the commoneſt and meaneſt ſeruices and workes, ſo as they be ſuch as

               <p>And yet this I adde, that as theſe and ſuch like muſt be done, and in one or other of them the ſixe dayes muſt be beſtowed, yet (I ſay) this muſt be added,<note place="margin">They muſt be done by faith.</note> that all theſe lawfull workes muſt be done of them <hi>in faith,</hi> that is, they muſt know that God commandeth ſuch workes to be done of them,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and therefore they do them readily and willingly, not for neceſſity onely, or for feare of puniſhment,<note place="margin">Not for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſpects.</note> or ſhame of the world, or becauſe they would be rich: all which are carnall, ſenſuall and diuelliſh reſpects, as I ſayd before in forbidding all vitious affections in mens lawfull actions; neither do they pleaſe God which thus go to worke.<note place="margin">Committing the ſucceſſe to God.</note> And further they muſt do theſe lawfull workes in perſwaſion and confidence that God will bleſſe them therein, and giue them good ſucceſſe, and take that for their <hi>daily bread</hi> and bleſſing, which God in their thus-going to worke, doth beſtow vpon them.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, they muſt do theſe without adding the common ſinnes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which wicked perſons do vſe at their worke,<note place="margin">Auoiding the common ſinnes that prophane ones ioyne vvith them.</note> as ſwearing, lying, negligence, idleneſſe, falſhood and deceiuing, curſing, quarrelling, impatience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.

                  <hi>&amp; making melodie to the Lord in your hearts, with thankes for all things through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> In this ſort hath God allowed his ſeruants, who haue learned and are reſolued to obey him in all things, to reioyce, and go about their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> affaires; and in like maner, doth he allow them to vſe all their lawfull liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in this life: all which, he knoweth they haue need of, to allay the tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and aſſwage the painfulneſſe and griefe which through their afflictions are infinite wayes ready in all places to meete with them. And not to do law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full buſineſſe and workes thus, and with the three former rules ſet downe, but as the vnruly and diſordered people of the world do them, is to make the lawfulleſt and excellenteſt callings baſe and meane, and to the perſons themſelues moſt hurtfull while they ſtand forth againſt them as accuſations, for that they haue vſed them vnlawfully, which in themſelues are very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and lawfull: which I ſay, that I may anſwer the brutiſh and irreligious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſort, who ſay they know no difference betwixt thoſe who are counted god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and themſelues; ſeeing they are faine (ſay they) to worke for their liuing, as well as we, their godlineſſe will not feede them.

               <p>I haue alſo ſpoken this by occaſion, for the ſatisfying of the ſimple-harted, that they may not thinke that (in requiring that we ſhould liue euery day in a godly maner) I do vrge any to leaue off, and lay aſide their callings and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe: and yet this I ſhew to be required by the Lord; how, and in what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner thoſe lawfull workes ought to be done of them, that he therein may be pleaſed. And ſo I conclude, that the beleeuer ought euery day to arme and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> frame himſelfe to a godly life, and to caſt off all that ſauoreth not thereof (as in ſome which are moſt vſuall actions I haue ſhewed) ſeeing his whole <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation muſt beſeeme the Goſpell</hi>; remembring what the wiſe man ſaith:<note place="margin">Philip. 1.27.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſixt point:</note>The ſixt point of our daily direction in thankfulneſſe: I meane, a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this duty to the Lord euery day,<note place="margin">Thankfulneſſe.</note> that ſo we may ſtill ſee and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our ſelues indebted vnto him, and be the fitter to go vnder any of his fatherly chaſtiſements, which he ſhall lay vpon vs, which without it, will preſſe vs downe, and raiſe bitterneſſe in our hearts: and alſo that by it, we may the ofter call to mind Gods many kindneſſes, to cheare our harts, which are too ſoone forgotten of vs. The Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> forceth this daily duty to be continued of vs,<note place="margin">Lament. 3.23.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>that the mercies of God are renewed vpon vs daily</hi>: and what followeth vpon that, but this, that our hearts ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and our mouthes ſhould ſet forth and declare his praiſe accordingly?

               <p>Therefore, did <hi>Dauid</hi> the faithfull ſeruant of God force himſelfe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this duty as too ſlouthful in his owne iudgement, though we reade of none more continually occupied in it, Pſalme 103.3. ſaying: <hi>Praiſe thou the Lord, ô my ſoule, and all that is within thee, praiſe his holy name:</hi> and further he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſaith, <hi>that he will be euer ſetting forth his goodneſſe, and praiſe his name alwayes.</hi>

               <p>And yet that none may hinder this duty in vs by ſaying, we are not bound to follow, no not good examples in all things, let vs well weigh the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſeuenth point:</note>The next duty to be daily performed of vs,<note place="margin">VVatch and pray.</note> is watchfulneſſe and prayer: of which two, as the firſt ought to be continuall, euen to ouer-ſee our whole worke in and through the day, and to looke before vs that all may be done to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the glory of God (for as the eye-lids preſerue the tender eyes from annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſo doth this our life from offence, and <hi>our feete from falling</hi>:) ſo this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely prayer, is to be as an helpe and hand-maid vnto that.</p>
               <p>And although I preſcribe no certaine rule, nor ſet houre to the ſolemne performing of this duty,<note place="margin">1.

Both of them are ſo farre to be in vſe with vs, as we are deſirous to retaine ſound peace and quiet minds toward God, and to be free from, or at leaſt, not to be ouercome of temptations: which ſeeing we are ſubiect vnto euery day, it cannot be doubted of, but as the one ſhould not ceaſe, I meane watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but be working in vs continually, and keepe vs waking out of ſpirituall ſlumber throughout the day; ſo the other which is prayer, ſhould quicken and ſharpen it, and both of them ſtrengthen vs, being oft and vſuall with vs, againſt all occaſions, which might elſe ouer-match vs.</p>
               <p>And can any be ignorant, when our Sauiour taught vs to pray euery day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> for <hi>our daily bread,</hi> but that we ſhould pray euery day for grace to be guided aright and comforted, there being as great need of it, and more, then of the other? The ſame thing he meant, when he vttered a parable to them to this end, <hi>that they ought to pray alwayes, and not to waxe faint</hi>: but euer willing, though not euer able. So that the life of a Chriſtian is no day well paſſed, when prayer (as it hath bin before deſcribed) is not one member &amp; part of it.</p>
               <p>The laſt point of our direction is, that we by meanes of all theſe,<note place="margin">The eight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peace.</note> as our faith, and feare of diſpleaſing God, &amp;c. may keepe and hold faſt our holy and moſt ſweete peace with God, <hi>and our reioycing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Co. 1.12.</note> which is the fruite of this Chriſtian walking, and an vnſeparable companion vnto the ſame. I haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> taught this in generall before: onely now I ſhew, that it is daily to be kept and maintained of vs, in ſuch wiſe, that as we regard our bodily mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance while we liue here, ſo ſhould we prouide that this our <hi>peace, which paſſeth vnderſtanding,</hi> be not broken off betwixt God and vs. If it be asked how this ſhall be; the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>If we be iuſtified by faith in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> we haue <hi>and do inioy it.</hi> And we haue heard, that the Lord hath both giuen liberty, yea and commandement to his children, that they ſhould daily beleeue <hi>and lay hold on eternall life,</hi> and reſt themſelues in the aſſurance of his loue: and how can this exclude that peace which we ſpeake of?</p>
               <p>Nay, our reioycing in the Lord, which is rather a degree beyond this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> peace, we are commaunded to entertaine and retaine <hi>alwayes,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.4.</note> at all times, that none may imagine that I meane, we ſhould onely ſome one time in the day or other poſſeſſe and inioy it. Neither indeed is any part of our life any day pleaſant vnto vs without it. Therefore the Apoſtle doth very fitly meet with an obiection of ours in the forenamed Scripture, thus: that if any of vs dare not preſume ſo farre as to take our part in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual reioycing in the Lord, or if we ſhold thinke, that the Apoſtle was not well aduiſed in offering ſo great libertie vnto vs, he repeateth his words thus <hi>(againe, I ſay, reioyce:)</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, you who are carefull ouer your ſelues, and ouer others, (for to ſuch he ſpeaketh) <hi>be ye merry and ioyfull in the Lord</hi> from time to time,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.16.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> yea and ſo as no worldly ſorrowes do breake it off.</p>
               <p>Now I haue ſhewed what are the neceſſary graces which ſhould acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the life of the beleeuer daily, I wiſh him to view the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all at one ſight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to ſee if he may well be without any of them: as without certainety of the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes, without feare of offending God, a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, and chearfull watching and praying againſt euill, &amp;c. And he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walke voide of any of them, ſo yet: he muſt not thinke but that there are
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:16851:178"/>
other particular actions beſide theſe, but they be all to be well ordered and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> gouerned by theſe. And now ſomewhat I will ſet downe about them, not vnprofitable and needleſſe. I haue briefly proued, that ſome certaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of directing a Chriſtian daily, is required in the word of God, and that it is no fancie of mans braine, thus nearly and narowly to looke to himſelfe: and haue ſet downe a draught thereof out of the Scripture, and therefore men muſt know,<note place="margin">Aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Reader about the direction.</note> that it is their ſinne, when they are not guided by theſe rules in the daily courſe of their liuing: I ſay, when theſe accompany them not, whatſoeuer their calling is, or the actions which they are occupied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, it is their ſinne, whether it be of ignorance, that they know them not (which is the leſſe, if they be willing to learne:) or careleſneſſe, or wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that they do not, or will not, regard them; and being ſinne, it is to be reſiſted, ſeeing no ſinne is to be borne withall, or reſted in.</p>
               <p>And that it may be thought more neceſſary to be daily guided in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we muſt know, that theſe graces which I haue ſpoken of, are not at ſome one time or other of the day to be thought or ſpoken of (thinke not this to be my meaning, in ſaying we muſt haue them euery day) for ſo, we might poſſibly be litle the better for them (as if once in a day a man ſhould pray, giue thankes, looke to his waies, to his peace, &amp;c.) a man might do all theſe &amp; the like, and yet not of neceſſitie well guided for all that, through the day: but this I meane,<note place="margin">VVhat the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer is to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by the direction.</note> that this holy furniture ſhould cloath and beautifie our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſoules throughout the day, and haue their ſetled abode in vs; and not ebbe and flow as the tide doth, nor go and come as paſſengers that tary not; but home-dwellers: as for example, that our peace ſhould not be broken off by any occaſion,<note place="margin">Note.</note> our watching ſhould not ceaſe, we ſhould keepe our ſelues from euill the whole day, and ſo likewiſe be ready to one duty or other, and we ſhould cheriſh our weake faith from time to time,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb. 10.35.</hi> and caſt not away our confidence, Flowers for a Christian to ſmell on.</note> retaining minds thankfull, and walking in the ſtrength of our prayers, though we be not euer vttering and expreſſing in words either pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or thankes.</p>
               <p>So that our hearts may be well ſeaſoned with theſe, as the chiefe things,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which we ſhould regard and looke after, and yet neglecting no needefull worke that muſt be done, but doing it much the better by meanes of theſe; and ſo the froth of our owne braines, as endleſſe and needleſſe wandrings, vaine cogitations, and fooliſh and noiſome deſires, ſhall be much reſtrained and allayed in vs. This is it (all wiſe men do know) that moſt troubleth vs, and of the which,<note place="margin">The vnruly heart, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt trouble that a man hath.</note> we be euery day in greateſt daunger; I meane, the looſenes and diſorderedneſſe of our hearts: for they, as they be neuer vnoccupied, but prone to euill a thouſand waies; ſo if they be not bridled, holden vnder, and ſuppreſſed, they are ſo ſoone fixed vpon ſome obiect that commeth in the way, that they carie vs headlong after it, we being then impotent for the time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and vnable to reſiſt, when we haue let them looſe, and giuen them ſcope.</p>
               <p>

Now what is a like remedie

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> againſt this, and all other baites of this deceitfull world, which the diuell lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in our way,<note place="margin">Daily directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the chiefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie againſt it.</note> as to haue our hearts daily fenced thus with watch and ward againſt them, as I haue ſaid, to hold ſuch ſinne execrable alwaies, to keepe in loue with pietie and goodneſſe, to retaine hope and confidence that God will make vs ſtrong againſt them, to liue in his fauour ſtill that we may want nothing that is good, and to enioy moſt ſweet and ſound peace to comfort vs ſo to our liking, that we may not neede to haſt greatly or gape after ſuch allurements, which are no better then deadly poyſon? What (I ſay) is like this precious remedie, to keepe vs in ſafetie euery day? Which God hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> therefore giuen vs, that we may be preſerued from infinite fearefull dangers, which are in this world, and that we may alſo liue with much comfort; yea, he that <hi>giueth his heart to the Lord,</hi> that it may be taught all theſe rules of the daily directing of a Chriſtian, can tell how true this is, and what reward is found and enioyed daily of ſuch as take delight in them.</p>
               <p>But many Chriſtians, who beare a good affection to the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Some Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (ſay what may be ſaid) will go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in practiſe of religion, then they be already</note> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally meane well, yet will not particularly trouble themſelues (as they count it) to be brought in their whole courſe within a narrower compaſſe, and to a more neare acquaintance with the Lord, yea when they heare that it is to become by, but would faine beare themſelues in hand, that they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> well inough; when yet they are oft conſtrained to feare, yea and to feele the contrarie: for what do they find but much wearineſſe and griefe, checkes and accuſations, yea and are ſometime alſo noted of others, to be but cold and barraine profeſſors, when they haue followed ſo much and ſo farre the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and deſires of their owne hearts? And beſides this, how much detract they from the beautie and excellencie of the godly life, and what iniurie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer they vnto it, when they are able no further to commend it then as they find, (for as they find, ſo they will ſpeake of it) whereas it cannot ſufficiently be eſteemed and accounted of: neither can the ſeruants of God, who haue experience of the benefite of it, ſatisfie themſelues in ſetting out the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> I deny not, but there are many, who for want of knowledge, do not ſee that which ſundrie others of their brethren do, and yet are faithfull in that which they know: but they reſt not ſatisfied with their preſent eſtate, but long much to ſee the will of God more clearely, and deſire feruently to attaine to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meaſure of grace. And to all ſuch I know, how welcome it will be to haue more cleare direction, then as yet they haue found: and ſuch I would haue know, that for their cauſes I was perſwaded to vtter that, which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed to me ſo farre as concerneth them. But as for ſuch as like ſo of their preſent eſtate, that they haſt not to be acquainted with any better, (ſeeing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there is euer in Gods children a deſire to grow, and a longing to be better) whatſoeuer they thinke of it, and how highly ſoeuer they account of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in it, they ſhall go forward euery one his way, till they be as blind as the moule, <hi>as deafe as the adder,</hi> as dumbe as he that openeth not his mouth,<note place="margin">

               <p>And this is that which I go about, that in this ſhifting and godleſſe world, ſome who are very willing alreadie to be guided well, but are vnable to direct themſelues, may haue ſome helpe by this which I haue written: who if they ſhould be hindred thus, namely, that they thinke, for all that can be ſaid, yet there will be wandrings out of the way, earthlineſſe of mind, frowardneſſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and much rebellion, and therefore to ſmall purpoſe it might ſeeme to be, to take great paines for little profite: I ſay (by the grace of God) their profite ſhall be great, and their paines ſmall, for the benefite which they ſhall reape by it, yea in time it will become pleaſure to them, after they ſhall accuſtome themſelues daily to ſeeke the Lord in ſuch manner, as I haue here taught, and as his word preſcribeth, and they ſhal ſee their ſtrongeſt rebellions much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and euill deſires much abated and aſſwaged in them, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues prepared and made fit by this well ſeaſoning of their hearts to make the actions of their liues correſpondent.</p>
               <p>And to vphold our <hi>ſelues in holineſſe</hi> thus as it is required of vs, no leſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> helpe is needfull,<note place="margin">1.

For although while the heart is thus looked vnto, (as it wold be of vs, if we counted it the neceſſarieſt worke that we haue to do through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the day) while the heart (I ſay) is thus looked vnto, euery thing doth well follow our hands, and much good is done in our liues: ſo yet, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we make great prouiſion, that this worke may be daily and conſtant, we cannot chuſe, no not the beſt of vs, but we ſhall commit many things in our liues vnbeſeeming our profeſſion, and ſmally to our owne comfort.

               <p>For if it were mens pleaſure and delight throughout the day to be well occupied one way or other, and in all that they ſhould go about, to haue their hearts readie to guide them aright therein, all other gaine-ſaying deſires of the fleſh ſhould ſoone be withſtood and reſiſted, and the occaſions, by which they were wont moſt of all to be hindered and withdrawne, ſhould be ſhunned and auoyded. And this may much ſet them forward in this courſe, that if they ſeeke to retaine conſtantly any one of theſe eight rules,<note place="margin">Follow one of theſe rules throughly, and all the other vvill be fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which are ſet downe to guide them daily, they may know, that it will be no hard matter to enioy all the reſt with it, ſeeing they hang together as linckes of a golden chaine. For they cannot arme themſelues with a mind free from the loue of ſinne preſent, but they muſt be repentant for their ſinne paſt, and embrace forgiueneſſe by faith, and <hi>find reſt to their ſoules,</hi> and filled with thankes: and ſo I ſay of the reſt, if they know this point of Gods will, that he requireth it, that one of them ſhould daily go with the other, as indeed the one cannot be without the other.</p>
               <p>And if any ſay, belike I go about to make men perfecter and holier,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> then the Lord euer did, and to perſwade, that they may ſerue God without ſtrife <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and battell with their owne luſtes and the diuell: I aske them againe, if this courſe of daily keeping our hearts in frame, and ſpirituall gouernement can be without moſt diligent obſeruing of our wayes, and ſtrong ſetting of our ſelues againſt all aduerſary power? And further, I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> that I go about no other thing then this, that Gods ſeruants may be beſt fenced againſt the common <hi>corruptions which are in the world through lust,</hi> and may honour God in the beſt maner, and themſelues liue with the moſt comfort, and that they may know and be perſwaded, that he of his mercy hath prouided this ſweete path-way to heauen, for his poore ſeruants, who are deſpiſed in the world. And they who haue not as yet experience of this ſeaſoning of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> hearts with grace daily, I wiſh them to deſire it aboue all other things, and in no wiſe to hold themſelues contented without it, if they deſire to do well and to ſee good dayes. And let me obtaine this at the hands of all well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſtians, that they beleeue it.</p>
               <p>But now I hauing ſpoken of the foundation, that ſhould be layd in the heart of all Gods people, vpon which the building of a godly life euery day is to be ſet, and without the which (indeuored after of euery one) it can in no wiſe ſtand; and that is, an heart indued with the ſeuerall gifts of the ſpirit,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:16851:180"/>
which I haue ſet downe; I haue thought it very meete and neceſſarie to adde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> one thing to this which I haue ſaid: and it is that, which the diligent reader will require and looke for, eſpecially if he be not well experienced in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of chriſtianitie.<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> And this it is: why men are not directed how to leade their liues daily, and to gouerne their tongues, as well as to rule and beautifie their hearts, and why they haue not direction how to do all their outward actions daily: (for of theſe, they ſay, no rule hath bene ſet down in this whole treatiſe) but onely of the well ordering of the heart; whereas that toucheth but ſome part of mens duties in the ſight of God: but all other things are left (as it ſeemeth) to our owne diſcretion, which are to be done in the eyes of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> men.</p>
               <p>To the which I anſwere, that the heart of true Chriſtians being kept thus purged from euill,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> and ſeaſoned graciouſly, (as we haue heard) <hi>good life and behauiour will come from thence,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 4.23.</note> as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: and according to the diuers occaſions, which ſhall fall out to euery one daily, his knowledge ſhall and will guide him either in his calling, or in the ſupply of it, by other neceſſarie duties: but more particularly, they muſt not looke that there can be any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine direction giuen of the outward parts of our liues, which of them ſhold be done euery day:<note place="margin">No rule is nor can be giuen, what outward vvorkes are to be done daily, ſeeing they are variable and infinite.</note> becauſe the actions of our liues are variable for the moſt part and innumerable, as all do know; and therefore cannot all be done vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> any one day: and men are conſtrained by ſundrie occaſions to do ſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties one day, &amp; ſome on another: and oft it falleth out, that ſuch as they muſt of neceſſitie do on ſome one day, or elſe they ſhall ſinne; (as following their callings painefully and diligently) they cannot do on ſome other, but they ſhall ſinne; as to viſite their parents on their death bed, or make peace betwixt men, when it is required at their hands.</p>
               <p>But further, and to the more full ſatisfying of ſuch as would deſire it, this I ſay; that although there can be no certaine and perpetuall rules giuen more particularly, which are as neceſſarie one day as any, (except we would lay burthens on Gods people which he himſelfe hath not done) and thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the heart inwardly, not the outward conuerſation: yet there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine duties of the life perfourmed in the ſight of men more commonly and vſually, then ſome other; and they are ſuch as do concerne all true people of God, and for the moſt part, fall out euery day at leaſt one or other of them, if not al. Theſe therefore which ſhall be of ſo great vſe among Gods ſeruants, I thinke not amiſſe to ſet downe, and ſo to ſatisfie their demaund ſo farre as Gods word giueth leaue: not of neceſſitie to tye any to the practiſing of them euery day, (which I would haue well to be marked) but as euery one ſeeth that he is bound: yet ſome one or other of them muſt be done euery day, as we ſhall ſee afterwards. And for the other which do not bind the conſcience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> euery day, (which I do ſet downe now immediatly following) and yet are profitable, and helpfull to liue well and happily: let a Chriſtian vſe them, and ſo many, and as oft as he may, and as he hath occaſion offered him, and as he gaineth thereby in godlineſſe, and winneth peace to his heart, and knoweth not how to do better, ſeeing it is an hard thing for the moſt Chriſtians to ſee particularly, how to paſſe the day in the particular parts of it from one houre to another, (eſpecially when they muſt intermit the workes of their calling)
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:16851:180"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> but it ſhall be in an idle &amp; very vnprofitable maner, without ſome ſuch helpe and furtherance. A briefe ſumme therefore of theſe I will ſet downe, with ſome ſhort explication, and vtter my mind more fully of them afterwards. And they are neuer done aright nor in their kind, except they proceed from the heart well ordered, as I haue ſaid before. And they are in number nine: the firſt whereof is this:</p>

               <p>And becauſe we are not, neither can be, alwayes ſetled to abide at home in our owne houſes, where it were eaſier to keepe ſome euen and equall courſe in our liues, as we are directed by Gods word, yea and ſomtime we be forced to be taken vp both in the trauell of the mind and body, more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about ſome weighty matters, in which caſe we ſhal be ready much more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> eaſily to forget our ſelues, and ſo become vnſetled; therefore let this watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word be remembred and regarded: that if any ſuch thing fall out, as by haſty and long iourneys, attendance vpon ſuites or great perſons, change of dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place, or change of our eſtate from ſingleneſſe to mariage, from pouerty to wealth,<note place="margin">Note.</note> or the contrary (as vnuſuall matters do more eaſily vnſettle) that in theſe, I ſay, and ſuch like, when any ſhall fall out, we be more carefull at ſuch times to be fenſed againſt all ſuch occaſions, then when we be voide of them: and that we do this, as we loue our peace and communion with God.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I will proceed to the third point, namely,<note place="margin">The third part of this fourth treatiſe.</note> of the neceſſity, profit and comfort of the daily direction: and then more largely ſpeake of theſe nine duties, ſeeing a Chriſtian ſhall find ſo great vſe of them, that he may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> be in ſome ſort helped thereby daily. Of this third part I ſhall not neede to ſay much, if that be well marked and conſidered, which I haue ſet downe of the two former. For if it be graunted, that God directeth vs dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how to go through the whole courſe of our liues,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and that he teacheth vs what manner of guiding vs this daily direction is (both which haue bene proued vnto vs:) who can doubt,<note place="margin">The daily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of our ſelues, a great gaine to vs.</note> but that it muſt needs be a thing of great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and reckoning, and of ſingular vſe, and gainefull? eſpecially to all ſuch as being of an vpright heart, are yet not ſo exerciſed in the Scriptures, nor ſo experienced (by meanes of the darkneſſe and blindneſſe that yet is in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them, and of ſundry other lets and diſcouragements) that they are able by their owne priuate helpe to draw out of all their readings, hearings and knowledge which they haue gotten, any indifferent forme or direction to gouerne themſelues.</p>
               <p>Beſides, many ſuch inioy not the miniſtery of the Goſpell ordinarily, but as they get it by their painefull trauell abroad; and many (the more is the pity) do not tye themſelues conſcionably to preach the moſt neceſſary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to their people, yea (I may ſay with griefe) are altogether vnfit to do it: and the diligenteſt Preachers and beſt able (for the moſt part) tarie not long to ſeaſon the hearers throughly with ſuch matter; but by death,<note place="margin">Many things to hinder from daily direction.</note> or other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> occaſions, are quickly remoued, or ſo mightily diſcouraged by their people and the diuerſe kinds of crabbed, teachy, ſcornefull, hollow, proud, prophane, and the like ill qualities of them, or ſome other wayes, that rarely it may be found, (what an admirable and lamentable thing do I vtter in this golden time of 44. yeares peace, ſcarſely to be hoped for halfe ſo long againe!) yea rarely (I ſay) it may be found, that in all this time there are growne many able to guide themſelues with ſweete peace, through their troubleſome liues. And we who know, that men without direction by Gods word, wander and walke in vncomfortable darkneſſe, what can we better do for the eaſing and helping of them to their hearts deſire, and ſatisfying of their neceſſities, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  <hi>ſhew them the eaſieſt and plaineſt way</hi> to eſcape and come out of it,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.17.</note> as God hath ſhewed vs?</p>
               <p>And therefore for mine owne part, I haue endeuoured in this worke to do the ſame: and although neither fully nor perfitly to ſet downe in a litle roome that will of God which is diſperſed throughout the canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; yet, ſo farre as God hath reuealed vnto me, that, which I count the beſt treaſure and commodity, that God hath beſtowed vpon me in this tranſitory
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:16851:183"/>
life; and that which how ſmall ſoeuer it may ſeeme in the eyes of any, yet of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whomſoeuer it be imbraced and eſteemed, ſhall be no leſſe then I haue ſayd, that is, neceſſarie, gainefull and comfortable.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is great: for that, whiles we walked before without ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine direction, we were neuer long ſetled, eſpecially with religious minds, how to beſtow the day nor the parts of it, in the actions of our liues, neither how to begin, nor how to end it; and therefore were much wearied and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted with forgetfulneſſe and raſhneſſe (I ſpeake of good people) vnſetled oft, and yet knew not how, neither how to returne againe. But ſince we haue bene guided more clearly and particularly,<note place="margin">VVhat benefit it bringeth.</note> we haue ſeene much better how one thing commeth to be done after another, and one duty not neglected for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> another, and ſo haue bene deliuered from much toile and tediouſneſſe: by it we learne how to riſe out of fals, and to keepe well whiles we are well. It is profitable for all ſorts, in what lawfull trade of life ſoeuer they liue, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready begun to change their liues, and thereby being fit and meete to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it. And ſuch are all that by faith in the Sonne of God are ſet free from their ſinne, and aſſured of his fauour.</p>
               <p>No other can well ſet themſelues about it, but ſhake it off, as they do al other good things:<note place="margin">VVho are fit to vſe it.</note> which I thought meete to put the reader in mind of, that although he ſhall not ſee this doctrine commonly practiſed in the world, yet he may not thinke it for all that, any nouelty which Gods word doth not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> warrant, or therefore needleſſe for himſelfe to go about. For ſome (no doubt) will be ready to count it ouer-ſtrict and more then needeth, to be tied to any ſuch thing, and to perſwade themſelues, that they may with ſome few duties doing, pleaſe God as well as they, who ſpend their whole life in ſearching out infinite points of Gods will to practiſe the ſame: and they count that an eaſie way to heauen in compariſon of the other, which they thinke long and tedious.</p>
               <p>But let ſuch vnderſtand that they are not fit to make their vſe of it. They muſt be other maner of perſons whom I ſpeake to, or go about to perſwade: for they who will weigh things aduiſedly, ſhall conſent (I doubt not) to that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> which I ſay; and ſhall ſee further the daunger of theſe men, who content themſelues to ſtand at a ſtay, rather then to be led ſtill forward in a fruitfull and holy courſe: and ſo being much idle and vnprofitable, imagine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by and by, that it can be no otherwiſe with men, whiles <hi>they here on earth be abſent from God</hi>; and ſo likewiſe that the chriſtian life is not ſuch, or ſo pleaſant as the Scripture euery where affirmeth it to be; which is nothing elſe then to charge it with falſhood and lies: but many of Gods deare ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants do know it, and find by experience, that this Chriſtian life hath no match, abounding in delights; yea, and thoſe moſt ſound, permanent and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
               </p>
               <p>To returne therefore to them whom God in mercy hath called to aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their ſaluation, for they by ſuch direction as I ſpeake of, ſhall ſee the Chriſtian life more eaſie by many degrees, then euer they found it whiles they walked after no certaine direction before:<note place="margin">Particular vſe and benefit of it.</note> ſuch (I ſay) both poore and rich, Miniſter and people, one and another, may learne, and that euery day through their life, how to keepe company, how to be ſolitarie, how to be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:16851:183"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> in their labours, how to ceaſe from them, how to riſe and how to lye downe, and how to beſtow the other times of the day; not diſcouraged at night though they did not all duties, (which in one day cannot be) but quiet and chearfull, ſeeing they did thoſe which by good direction they ſaw moſt neceſſary. For they ſhall be taught by it to keepe a certaine proportion and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in their actions, that as one ſauoreth of Religion, and a godly mind, ſo may the other alſo: and as they ſpeake and heare the word well, ſo they may haue their thoughts good alſo, &amp; their harts purged from whence both theſe do come: and as in their prayers to be holily affected, ſo in their husbandry, houſwifery, feaſting, iourneying, buying, eating and other dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that ſo euery part of the day in the diuerſe actions of it, may haue the proper due thereof; which if it may be obtained, is not meanly to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, if we conſider how many thouſands, neuer taſt of this dainty through the yeare (which we may inioy euery day:) yea, and for the want of it, haue a wofull and a deceiueable paſſing of the time, and for the moſt part weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and tedious.</p>
               <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">Other benefit of it.</note> we may by the benefit of it ſo be occupied in our earthly and common buſineſſe, as from the ſame we may come readily and willingly to heauenly exerciſes (whereas the moſt come vntowardly:) and alſo in the ſame buſineſſe we may haue our minds heauenly, and therefore our actions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> which are done thereby to be there after.</p>
               <p>And whereas many euen of good hope are wont to complaine and ſay, that longer then they be in praying, reading or ſuch like exerciſes, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keepe in any well ordered courſe, any long time in the day together, but are diſtracted like others of the world which vſe neither reading, nor prayer: yet we by the helpe which God giueth vs hereby, when we neceſſarily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, and ceaſe from them for a time (being occupied in our calling or other profitable duties) we (I ſay) may hold a good and well ordered courſe in our other actions and buſineſſe in and through the day notwithſtanding.<note place="margin">A third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vſe and benefit of it.</note> And more then this, when we can bring our hearts to looke carefully to this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as to our harueſt, we ſhall get ſuch a diſtaſt in euill, in reſpect of that which we had ſometime, that we ſhall haue great liberty to forſake and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it.</p>
               <p>And here for the better incouragement of the reader to looke more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into this matter, and not to be diſmayed by the ſtrangeneſſe and vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomedneſſe of the thing to the which I perſwade,<note place="margin">An example of ſome vvho imbraced this doctrine, hovv they profited by it.</note> I will faithfully report vnto him the ſpeech of ſundry Chriſtians, long taught, and of the beſt ſort of ſuch as had profited by the preaching of the Goſpell (as farre as I could iudge) in thoſe parts. When they firſt heard of any forme of daily directing them, whereby men are taught to be euery day kept in the ſame holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that they ſhould be any day: ſome conceiued it not at the firſt hearing, ſeeing they had not bene acquainted with it: ſecondly, ſome ſmiled at it, as thinking it impoſſible to be brought into practiſe: thirdly, ſome confeſſed that their hearts did riſe againſt it, as perceiuing, that it was a certaine rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in great part of their former liues, which was a thing vnwelcome to fleſh.</p>
               <p>But it appeared to be a fault in all three ſorts, by this that they did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:16851:184"/>
correct themſelues. For when they ſaw further into it, and weighed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the benefit of it more deeply, they were of another iudgement, and ſayd as a fourth ſort did ſay when it came firſt to their hands; that they did highly approue of it, and that it ought to be ſo, and that for want of ſuch helpe and direction, they had bene much confounded and troubled in their courſe, and that they would haue thought themſelues happy if they could poſſibly haue attained to the practiſe of it; wiſhing that they had bene acquainted with it long before. For they ſaw in peruſing the parts of this daily direction, which I haue here ſet downe, that their hearts and liues ſhould be freed from many incumberances hereby, wherewith they were before annoyed: and that they ſhould ſerue God and liue with men, much more chearfully then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> they did before. And this is the ſumme of their firſt ſpeech, which diuerſe honeſt and well diſpoſed Chriſtians vſed: which I report for the further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging and perſwading of the Reader to a more free and willing receiuing of this courſe, which I offer and ſet before him.</p>
               <p>After this, they were aduiſed, and exhorted to go about the practiſing of it according to the ſeuerall points thereof,<note place="margin">Hovv to deale about the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to make it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</note> after the right and cleare vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and due conſidering of it; and to ſhew faithfully, how they felt it to helpe them forward in well paſſing the day, more then when they walked without it in the world: and which points of it, they found hard to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: and how they were letted, or what liberty they found more by it, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the gouerning of their liues, then when they looked not after it. Thus they were counſelled to make triall of it by the moneth, and ſo by the quarter of the yeare, and to ſignifie, whether any ſuch daily courſe might poſſibly be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened vpon Chriſtians, and with fruit, which (doubtleſſe) few are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. And after triall made priuatly by themſelues, they inioying alſo the publike Miniſtery to the further inlightning of them about the ſame, they confeſſed freely, to the praiſe of God, that they found and obtained more vſe of their knowledge, more conſtancy in their courſe, and ſweete de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſeruing of God then they euer looked for, or once could haue asked of God, before they did in ſuch particular maner looke to their waies, though <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> they <hi>had ſet their hearts to ſeeke the Lord ſome while before.</hi> For they ſayd, when they did conſider, that God ought as well one day haue his due at our hands as another (which they had not thought vpon ſo throughly; but now by the helpe of this, they began to ſee more clearly: and that it was nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the greatneſſe and goodneſſe of God, that he ſhould be ſerued by fits, and vncertainly; ſome day a litle, ſome day nothing at all) they confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they framed their minds of conſcience, to looke to their wayes more conſtantly and carefully, and that in one part of the day as another: and more eſpecially, that they did vſually conſider of, and call to mind Gods loue and kindneſſe in his many mercies much more often, then in times paſt when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> they thought of them but ſeldome. And hereby, they ſaw ſuch bleſſing of God vpon their labours and indeuors,<note place="margin">VVhat fruite theſe men rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the helpe of direction.</note> that they were able with chearfulnes and without tediouſneſſe to paſſe the day in their calling, and in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of other neceſſarie duties either at home or abroad as occaſion was offered, which they could neuer do before, for any long time together: they were not vnſetled by matters about family, nor ſo eaſily and readily paſſing
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:16851:184"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their bounds, and ouer-ſhooting themſelues, in dealing about their worldly affaires: they were not ſo ſoone prouoked to vnquietneſſe by loſſes or other of Gods chaſtiſements, nor to breake out into heart-burning, fretting and vncharitableneſſe againſt ſuch as offered them hard meaſure in ſpeech or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: they did now more narrowly view their deſires &amp; affections, which way they caried them, and what deceitfulneſſe was in them; which yet for many of them, they had not before ſuſpected, or at leaſt, litle laboured againſt them: and how oft they had ſmarted by them, when they had not this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard daily. They ſaw they could willingly do one good thing or other in the day, for the moſt part, or at leaſt keepe themſelues from euill, and were not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> maiſtered of idleneſſe, or buſying themſelues needleſly in other mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: they were not vſually ſo vntoward when they went to prayer, nor wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in many of their actions ſo looſely, as they well remembred they had done before: they now could find matter to ioy in, and make their ſongs of, (euen the many kindneſſes of God, which haue no end) whereas their ioy was wont to be in thinking of that which they had, or deſiring that which was other mens, or dreaming of long life, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And aboue the reſt, this did exceedingly comfort them, that whereas they had oft times before that, bene much ſhaken with feare, that they ſhould not with any peace perſeuer to the end: now their experience in ſubduing their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> vnruly affections, and ſetting themſelues to frame their liues to Gods will as they were able, and that for ſome continuance one day as another, did giue them ſtrong hope, that they ſhould much more eaſily do the ſame hereafter: yea and were perſwaded, that if the Lord ſhould exerciſe them with harder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, then they had as yet ſuſtained, that he would alſo vphold them euen therein; and that <hi>as they ſhould increaſe, ſo ſhould their comfort increaſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.12.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould be made able to beare them. So that this daily tying of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to record and thinke vpon Gods kindneſſes towards them, in that he had made them happie, both here, had giuen them ſure hope of happineſſe for hereafter, and the ſubmitting themſelues to be guided daily, did greatly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> amend them (as we ſee by their owne confeſſion) in their whole courſe. And what maruell though it was thus with them?<note place="margin">Great differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> betwixt a daily guiding of vs, and an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> For is there not (thinke we) a great difference betwixt a daily, and a ſeldome or vncertaine view of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate? betwixt a particular obſeruing our waies, and a generall courſe in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie? For although men may haue without ſuch like helpe and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, oftentimes their hearts well affected, yet will it be nothing like with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as when they do with a reſolute and conſtant purpoſe aboue all other things looke to this one, and not to be remoued from it, ſeeing it is the beſt of all,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 3.</note> daily and through the day <hi>to hold fast the profeſsion of their hope with ioy,</hi> and to be careful to pleaſe God in one thing as in an other. For then doth Chriſts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> commendation of <hi>Marie</hi> reach alſo to them, that they count <hi>one thing neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and they haue choſen the good part, and it ſhall not be taken from them:</hi> when they can teſtifie to their owne conſciences, that in their weightie buſineſſes and dealings, and in their matters of pleaſure and profite, they be thus indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently caried about them; that this one thing is ſtill counted needfull, that is, by faith to reſt in God, and ſtill to be ruled by his word.</p>
               <p>But to end my report of theſe Chriſtians, for proofe of that which they
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:16851:185"/>
ſay of the benefite of the daily direction faithfully obſerued: they alleadge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that it was not wont to be thus with them, no not ſince they had embraced the Goſpell, had hope of ſaluation thereby; nay, and that they were wont, as ſoone as they had bene out of their beds, by and by to haue their hearts ſet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſome light and fooliſh matter, or to haue falne into iarres and brawles, or to be caried into the world, and ſo earneſtly ſet vpon the ſame one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as that all goodneſſe was forgotten: yea, and this alſo euen ſince they had receiued ſome care to pleaſe God, and that prayer a ſpirituall dutie of all other moſt vſually intended to be frequented of them, yet by the leaſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was put by and omitted. And when the morning (which being the firſt part of the day, ſhould be conſecrated to the ſeruice of God, if in any conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> it may be) hath bene thus prophanely ſpent and taken vp, the whole day after (we may be ſure) hath bene ſutable for the moſt part and anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So that they haue not felt that ſweetneſſe in their liues, which by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had heard to be graunted of God to his people to enioy: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, they felt much weariſome paſſing of the day, and clogging of their hearts with their corruptions; which ſince they tooke this order, hath bene farre otherwiſe with them, yea euen in the new entrance into it (which we all know to be then weakeſt) much trifling out the time in companie by tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king needleſly of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of their dealings, was wont to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with them; and in ſolitarineſſe a ſpending of their thoughts and deſires after the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> like manner vainely, vntill they were able more wiſely to diſcerne how to giue euery dutie in the day his time, and how to occupie both the one and the other throughout the day. But they haue with heartie thankes to God proteſted, that after they had attained to this, they ſaw farre more clearely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the practiſe of Chriſtianitie, then euer before they did, and found the Lords yoke farre more eaſie to them, and themſelues ſetled with more ſound peace in the leading of their liues. This report of ſome Chriſtians, whom I know well, I haue ſet downe (where by this little, the reſt may be coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) for the better encouraging of the reader to be acquainted with a daily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for the courſe of his life, and that he ſhould not reſt in a generall and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> vncertaine obedience to God. And let nothing that I haue ſaid of them, be thought needleſſe or vnmeete for vs, as long as we can ſee good reaſon for this which they did.</p>
               <p>But know wee, that this kind of ſeruing God, both may bee, and is, and hath bene (God be thanked) vſed of many of Gods ſeruants, though I will not ſay in a like maner, and ought to be of the reſt, as euery one ſhall be able to ſee into it. And therefore I purpoſe to thruſt no fancie nor conceit vpon any, but that which all well aduiſed perſons muſt iuſtifie, to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God: and which bewrayeth too plainely, that many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpell haue not ſo much ſought for the ſound practiſe of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> godly life, by reading the ſtories of holy men in the word of God, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port generally that they haue bene holy; neither haue reaped that benefit by the Scripture, in enioying a ſweet life aboue other men, as the Lord in much mercie hath affoorded them.</p>
               <p>For though the ſect of the Family of loue, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie other lying ſpirits do fancie a courſe which the Scripture knoweth not,

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and ſome of them alſo fantaſtically haue for euery day in the weeke, deuiſed an order to be followed, as the reading of certaine taskes, nothing leſſe then proper to direct their liues: yet in this, which I here propound, namely, that we ſhould be daily directed in our whole courſe, I haue followed no fancie and dreame of man; but haue in all good conſcience ſpoken from God, and drawne it from the Scripture both for the learned and ſimple, high and low, one and other, and is neuer in vaine to the right vſer of it: although I deny not, but that a skilfuller handler of it, might haue ſet it downe farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely.</p>
               <p>But from whence is the difficultie that it is no more in practiſe, being a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> treaſure of ſo infinite value, and that ſo many pray, and ſome of them often, to leade a godly life; yet when and where they ſhould not, there they fauour themſelues, and ſay, they are weake and vnable? From whence I ſay is this,<note place="margin">VVhat is a ſpeciall hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing daily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</note> but from hence, that they will put no diligence thereunto, to obſerue their waies in which they proſper, and contrariwiſe? alſo there is no aunſwerable trauell, nor labour for skill and experience in this Chriſtian courſe, to that which is in all other; but euery litle is tedious to them and weariſome. They are ſeuen yeares at other trades to learne them, though they be apt to them, and forward in them, before they are thought fit to occupie by themſelues.</p>
               <p>But yet without ſeuen yeares or ſeuen moneths diligent exerciſing of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> rules of chriſtian life, (for before they be conuerted to the obedience of God, what reckoning is to be made of their profeſſing?) they will be thought fit to do as the beſt in this trade of chriſtian liuing, although it be cleane againſt their nature. Nay I ſay more, he is a rare man,<note place="margin">Note.</note> who can be perſwaded to be guided by religion and the rules thereof, but ſeuen weekes conſtantly, I may truly ſay ſeuen dayes: for if he who would but ſo long giue ouer himſelfe to liue by faith, and walke with God, he would neuer ſeeke to be looſened, and ſet at libertie againe to his old life, but would renounce it vtterly, ſo great ſhould his aduantage be in this courſe and trade.</p>
               <p>And as I know, that this is the maine and greateſt cauſe, why ſo fewe are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> lights and examples to others, ſo when people are taught the truth clearely concerning this matter, (for I am ſure that it is neglected of many through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance) let them either reſolue to be gouerned through the day, and from day to day, or let them looke to find ſmall reioycing in the chriſtian life with much vncomfortableneſſe, which otherwiſe need not to be. And therefore in the feare of God, let men thinke and iudge of themſelues as Gods word teacheth them: yea, let them profeſſe as they be, or let them looke to find as they be, and not as they profeſſe. But as the moſt do handle the matter,<note place="margin">Note.</note> they ſhall find it harder to practiſe a chriſtian life after ſeuen yeares twiſe told, then the hardeſt trade after halfe ſeuen. And as it is with many of them who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> learned their occupation well, that they are neuer skilfull in it, nor thriue by it as others do: ſo one eſpeciall cauſe why many neuer practiſe godlineſſe to the welfare of their ſoules, neither proſper nor be well liking therein, is: becauſe they neuer ſoundly learned how to liue godly for continuance, and conſtantly one day as an other;<note place="margin">Note.</note> but peeced and patched vp the ſame with here a good deede, and there another, and in being ſometime deuout and zealous, the moſt of their actions being vnregarded: and of many of them it
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:16851:186"/>
may truly be ſaid, <hi>the power of godlineſſe</hi> was neuer throughly rooted and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Theſe rules and the like for the daily directing of a Chriſtian, are to be well conceiued and approued in our conſcience to be ſuch as are very fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to guide vs, (the which, whoſoeuer hath the ſpirit of God, doth or may diſcerne) becauſe they are according to the word of God, and practiſe of his children, and ſo he yeeldeth to them: and of euery ſuch they are duely and daily to be regarded, ſo farre as God giueth him to conceiue of, and ſee into them: this indeuouring to practiſe them will bring a man increaſe daily of ſound libertie and freedome from bondage to his boiſterous paſſions and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly life, and recompence an hundred fold in ſweet peace all his loſſe in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> earthly and vaine delights, which he was wont to make the flower of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing they will worke vpon the ſimpleſt whoſe heart is vpright, and which the Lord hath opened to conceiue them, therefore when thou ſeeſt that thou art ſuch a one, and that thou haſt felt them, (theſe rules of directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I meane) to perſwade and draw thee on to follow them,<note place="margin">An exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vſe it, and againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> forgo not this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, neither fall from this holy beginning, neither quench thou this flame of grace: but cheriſh it in thee daily, and truſt not the fleſhly wiſedome of thine heart, (whereby thou mighteſt be diſcouraged) ſeeing thou haſt often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and found it deceitfull: but inquire into it ſtill euery day, leſt ſome poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſhould lurke ſecretly in any corner of it, to waite thee a miſchiefe, and to giue oportunitie to thine enemie to make thy hurt yet greater, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caſt it vp as vomite: and if, after thou haſt had ſome good vſe of this or ſuch like direction, thou ſhalt feele it to waxe common, and vnſauourie to thee, (vnleſſe thou art ſure, that thou chaungeſt for the better) take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vnto thy ſelfe, and caſt out that diuell <hi>by faſting and prayer.</hi> Prouide that thou mayeſt continue it, and happie ſhalt thou be both here and hereafter: and if thou thinke this be litle that I ſay, tell me how thou ſhalt ſpeede better any other way.</p>
               <p>Thinke not vpon the many yeares in the which thou art to continue it, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> diſcourage thy ſelfe thereby, as though thou tookeſt in hand a thing vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or toileſome, for the beginning is the hardeſt: and as young children are to be led here a ſteppe and there another, till they can go alone; ſo go thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it firſt by weekes, and ſo by moneths, till thou haſt gotten experience for a whole yeare or more: after which time, thy difficultie will be well ouer; and thou ſhalt find it a more <hi>eaſie yoke and light burden</hi> to thee by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, then thou wert wont. And while I exhort thee to the diligent regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this daily direction, I do not call thee either from ſeeking knowledge, or from the practiſing of any neceſſarie dutie which might be required at thy hand: but I encourage thee to both; as that thou ſhouldeſt ſo ſtore and ſtuffe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> thy ſelfe by all meanes as thou canſt, that out of this ſtore and treaſurie thou maiſt fetch matter daily to furniſh thy life withall, and be made <hi>fit vnto euery good worke</hi> in the day.</p>
               <p>This is ſuch a guide as is able to carrie thee ſafely, as I haue ſaid: howbeit, if it ſhall pleaſe God to bring to light a plainer and ſounder, be readie to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; but reſt thankefull to God in the meane ſeaſon for the helpe thou

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> maiſt haue by this. But for my weake brethrens ſake, whom (while I goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to helpe and ſet forward,) I would be loath to hinder and diſcourage, this I thinke good to adde: that they who cannot yet apprehend the whole, neither ſee it poſſible to be guided by euery of theſe rules which I haue ſet downe, let them be readie to do better then they haue done, as they ſhall be taught; let them be willing to adde ſomewhat to their hearing, reading, and prayers both in time to do them ofter, and in feruencie, to quicken them to indeuour more carefully to practiſe that which they ſhall be able. I know all cannot be partakers of the ſame meaſure of grace, and yet one and the ſame direction is fit for the ſtrong, and the weake; and he is in good way, who is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> willing to be directed: onely, this is the caueat which I giue to my brethren:<note place="margin">Note.</note> Let not that be deſpiſed in a ſcornefull manner, which men well vnderſtand not; nor vpon ſtomacke refuſed or miſliked, which they ſufficiently weigh not, and all becauſe it cutteth off many parts of bad behauiour, which they cannot readily caſt off, &amp; depriueth of vaine liberties, which they were wont to vſe when they knew no better. He that frameth himſelf faithfully to be led by any one of the fore-mentioned rules conſtantly, will deſire and ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a part in the reſt as I haue ſaid: although there be not preſent ſtrength to accompliſh that which he deſireth, ſeeing faith in him is weake, whereby he ſhould come by and attaine it. And to ſuch I ſpeak, not doubting to aſſure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> euen them, that God will giue them a bleſſed fruite of this trauell, how farre ſoeuer they feele themſelues off from poſſibilitie of taking good by the ſame.</p>
               <p>And as I deſire to helpe theſe, ſo I would be glad to ſatisfie others, as much as I can, though they be as yet further off from eternall life then they.<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> And therefore if any ſuch ſhall demaund (when they haue ſeene and conſidered theſe rules for their daily direction:) What ſhall men do through the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the looking to their waies and hearts, as is before ſet downe? for nothing (they will perhaps alleadge) hath bene ſaid of the ſundrie actions and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kinds of the dealings of men, which go through their hands in the day, which are things indifferent, and may either be done, or left vndone: &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it would be looked for (ſay they) that in a direction for the day it ſhould be preſcribed, how euery thing, yea the doubtfulleſt actions ſhould be done, and ſomewhat ſaid thereof, that men may ſee what to go forward with, and what to lay aſide.</p>

And whereas I teach Chriſtians in this place firſt, when they awake to be with God,<note place="margin">VVe ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome our ſelues to good thoughts at our awaking with God.</note> and to accuſtome their thoughts to be holy, I meane indeed ſo much: that ſo ſoone as they awake, they ſhould be taken vp about heauenly things, (<hi>for where their treaſure is, there ſhould alſo their hearts</hi> be) as to thinke of Gods kindneſſe and loue towards them, and that they abide ſtill in his fauour, as at any time before: the remembrance whereof at our firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> breaking off our ſleepe, what can be like ſweet and comfortable? euen as a priſoner condemned but to temporall death, doth on the contrarie, at his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking out of ſleepe, fall into moſt dreadfull thoughts and feare. They are alſo to thinke how they haue bene refreſhed by their reſt, and kept from the manifold dangers of the night, &amp;c. by the which many haue miſcaried. And all theſe and ſuch like meditations ſhould ſalute them, when they firſt awake, to this end, to reuiue that foundneſſe of heart, wherwith they lay downe the night before (if they lay downe as became them:) and alſo that no roote of bitterneſſe breake out of them to ſtaine their actions at their firſt entring into the day: which were very like to be, if it ſhould not be preuented, and held <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> out by ſome ſuch gracious thoughts.<note place="margin">Three good fruites of holy awaking with God.</note> Alſo by this meanes, they prouide well for the better keeping their liues in frame all the day after: without the which regard had, in purpoſe to performe it aſſoone and as well as they can, they are ſo ready to range and go aſtray one way or other, that although they did lye downe the night before in peace, and with quiet and meeke hearts; yet, the diuell (as we know it well) watching his oportunitie, they may eaſily be

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> vnſetled; and ſo, runne into ſundrie euils, which cannot be auoided.</p>
               <p>All which being conſidered, who doth not ſee, how great a meane this kind of awaking with God is, and how worthily it may be reckoned for one of our duties, to indeuour to take vp ſome time thus when ſleepe departeth? Neither let any obiect, that this is more then poore Chriſtians can attaine to (for all ſuch would faine attaine to that grace, if they were taught how, and directed) the Lord hauing framed and fitted them for it, euen by this, that he hath made them Chriſtians, and therewithall hath giuen them hearts, which are willing thereunto: but yet euery man in his meaſure, and as he hath receiued of God, <hi>which giueth to no man nigardly,</hi> who ſeeketh heartily. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> if this ſatisfie not ſome, who deſire to begin the day aright after their firſt perfit ſhaking off of ſleepe and awaking: let ſuch for their better direction, breake their minds to thoſe who through longer experience are better exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the wayes of the Lord then themſelues.</p>
               <p>Onely this caueat and watch-word I giue, that if through barrenneſſe in good things thou art not able to ſet thine heart a worke (when ſleepe is gone from thee) to faſten vpon ſomewhat that is profitable to thy ſoule,<note place="margin">Vſe vvhat meanes may be, to giue to God the firſt thoughts.</note> or to thy companion, if thou haſt any with thee: ariſe, if it be conuenient: if not, and that thou feeleſt thy heart to be caried vnto prophaneneſſe, or to cauſe thy mouth to ſinne any way, checke thy ſelfe, rebuke thine heart, and ſo take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> euen by thy euill, to do good: And remember him, who at his firſt awakings in the morning, did thus giue vnto the Lord the firſt fruits of the day, as I haue taught thee to do; as in the Pſalme, where he ſaith: <hi>O Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 5.3.4. &amp; 119.147.</note>

                  <hi>Wiſdome ſhall commune with thee when thou wakest, and guide thee when thou walkeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words of the Pſalme, although they be not to be vnderſtood only of the time of our firſt awaking, yet they include that time, as well as any other in the day: but that place of <hi>Salomon</hi> doth plainely ſhew, that it ought to be as vſuall and ordinary, to ſet our hearts on worke about ſome holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> things when we firſt awake, as it ſhould be, to looke to be guided by Gods word all the day through. And there is no doubt, but if this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ſuch like were beleeued, and well weighed, directly tending to this end, to teach Chriſtians to take vp their hearts in holy cogitations and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly deſires, before the diuell hath poyſoned them, and euilly imployed them: and further, if they would be willing to ſee this firſt letting looſe their hearts to ſundry ſinnes (as ieſting, vaine laughter, light and looſe talke, iar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, contention, depth of worldlineſſe, and ſuch like) to be one chiefe cauſe of an vnprofitable, yea an offenſiue life in the day afterwards; it ſhould be farre better with them then it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> I meane, if they would thus do, they ſhould find much more eaſe in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God, and fruite therein, and comfort thereby, both in the morning and all the day after: whereas I ſee with mine eyes, &amp; heare it with mine eares, that many paſſe the day very vnbeſeeming Chriſtians, who haue long ſought the Lord (though only in a generall manner indeed:) and others ſee, that it is not with them ſo well as both it might and they themſelues know it ſhould be: who do perhaps ſome one time in the day now and then go to prayer,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:16851:188"/>
but otherwiſe they haue litle regard of many their actions: &amp; yet their prayers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which they make, are not, for the moſt part, powred out to God, till their heads and harts both are ſo filled and fraught with the world and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they haue made themſelues in a maner vnfit to pray.</p>
               <p>And as for ſuch as ſay, they haue other matters to thinke on as ſoone as they be awake, and they cannot beſtow their time after that manner, it may pleaſe them to know, that as for the time (if their heart were ready and did know how to do this duty) it might very ſufficiently and well-nigh be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſo much time (for a need) as the Lords prayer diſtinctly vttered might be ſayd ouer in. For in ſuch a ſpace might a Chriſtian lift vp his heart to God, and ſalute him with an holy remembring of his fatherly kindneſſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and namely, for preſent preſeruation in ſoule and body, and confirme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his former ſound-hartedneſſe: which, if he did no more, were a true and right awaking with God, and the onely right way to thinke of other things as they ought.</p>
               <p>Therefore with thine heart thus ſeaſoned (if it may be) addreſſe thy ſelfe to be ready to any duties which thou haſt to do, and be ſtrongly perſwaded and confident, that God, who loueth thee ſo dearly (as in thy prayer thou beleeuedſt, and in thy thankſgiuing thou didſt acknowledge) that he (I ſay) will be with thee, to guard thee from all aduerſary power of Sathan and his inſtruments,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.16.</note> which might riſe vp againſt thee, and by the comfort of his holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſpirit keepe thee from euill: for he which hath all power in his hand <hi>looketh downe from heauen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Chro. 16.9.</note> 
                  <hi>and beholdeth all the earth, to ſhew himſelfe ſtrong with them, which are of an vpright heart towards him</hi>: and therefore be incouraged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, with confidence to ſet vpon any duty, and to withſtand any euill.</p>
               <p>And further, remember that thou art armed by God with all furniture meet for the ſeruant of God, with faith to beleeue all Gods promiſes, with hope to be kept from fainting, with righteouſneſſe to performe all duty, with ſincerity to do it with a ſingle heart, with knowledge of the word of God to direct thee aright, and with <hi>the preparation of the Goſpell of peace to be ſhod</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt troubles and dangers in thy voyage to Gods kingdome. Remember <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> all theſe, and that thou haſt not the right vſe of theſe, except thou beeſt ſetled againſt the diſcouragements, which might ſtand vp in thy way. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be chearfull and of good courage, although there are many things which may, one time or other, put thee to trouble; and many occaſions of vnquietneſſe and vnſetledneſſe may ariſe, which alſo would otherwiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſoreſhake thee. Thus before thou goeſt about any thing, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for thee to renew thy faith, that thou mayeſt reſt freſhly on God for his protection throughout the day, and waite to ſee it ſo, and obſerue that thou mayſt be guided by him, and make thy heart mery in him: conſidering, that he is more to thee then all the world beſide. And this for the declaration,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and further laying open of this firſt duty, as with any conuenience it may be done, to teach vs, how to awake with God.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow when thy heart ſhall after thy firſt ſhaking off thy ſleepe be lifted vp to thy God, ſet thy ſelfe to the next part of thy duty; prayer,<note place="margin">Dan 6.10.</note> confeſſion of ſins and thankſgiuing in ſolemne maner vpon thy knees; caſting off and renouncing ſuch fooliſh and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thoughts and fantaſies as were wont and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſtill may hold thee from this duty: and ſet vpon it, as ſoone as thou canſt conueniently, yea,<note place="margin">If it may be, begin the day vvith ſolemne prayer.</note> if it may ſo be, let it be the firſt worke that thou ſhalt take in hand in the morning ſeaſon (except in time of ſickneſſe, when thou keepeſt thy bed, and then ioyne it with the former rule, and make of both one: and pray ſhortly when paine giueth thee no further libertie, but yet feruently and more often.) But if it cannot be thy firſt worke, yet let not thy deferring of it be a breaking it off, if thou mayſt performe it: neither let a light occaſion cauſe thee to deferre it; for ſuch ſhall neuer be wanting, eſpecially thine owne vnwillingnes, or ſlouth: but when for ſome eſpeciall and weightie cauſe thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> doeſt deferre it, returne (if it may be) after thy neceſſarie buſineſſe ended to the performing of it, &amp; therwith, renew thy couenant of amendment of life.</p>
               <p>And to expreſſe my meaning about this more plainely, remember and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the kindneſſe of thy God in benefits daily and hourely receiued both to ſoule and bodie: and ſometime particularly,<note place="margin">And herein thankes.</note> that ſo thou mayſt be more nearly knit vnto him, and delight in him. For daily and oft thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to God is of great force to ſubdue thee vnto God, and to maintaine a thankfull heart in thee all the day following.</p>
               <p>And let another part of this morning worſhip of God adioyned to this, be an hearty recording and viewing of thy ſinnes,<note place="margin">And an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing of ſinnes.</note> a bewailing and confeſſing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them to God, and accuſing of thy ſelfe, with an eſpeciall remorſe for thoſe which haue moſt troubled thee, and be humbled vnder the burthen of them: that ſo thou mayeſt ſee thy ſelfe a wretched perſon, and infinitely indebted to God, and ſo withhold thy heart from inſolencie and ſecuritie, and be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-hearted, that thou mayſt the better abide ſo after. And with both theſe ſend vp loud cries vnto the Lord, through Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">And requeſt.</note> confidently looking for pardon of them, that thus thou mayſt find the death of Chriſt daily freſh, ſweete and ſauorie to thee, which the moſt do make too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and vnſauorie.</p>
               <p>And pray alſo in faith for grace and power to mortifie thy ſinne, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> direct thy wayes, and for all earthly bleſſings; and by thine owne neceſſities be moued with compaſſion towards thy brethren, euen the whole company of the militant Church, who haue the like need of Gods bleſſing as thou haſt: and (withall) that <hi>thoſe which are yet without,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.3.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſtrangers from the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Iſrael,</hi> may be brought home: that thus thou mayſt both teſtifie thy loue to them, and daily remember and conſider, how thy ſelfe and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do depend vpon him for whatſoeuer is good and neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:16851:189"/>And to helpe forward this dutie the better, ſome meditation or muſing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> vpon ſuch things as may aſſwage the bitterneſſe and corruption of the heart,<note place="margin">Alſo medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and ſeaſon it with grace, were a thing moſt requiſite, as euerie one may be brought to it. As for example: ſometime, of our mortalitie; of the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie and ſlipperie eſtate of all things vnder the Sunne; of the change of perſons, times, eſtates; of the glorie of the kingdome of heauen: ſometime of our ſaluation, to make it more ſure; of the duties we are to do in the day, and how we may keepe our ſelues from the defilements and ſinnes, which we are in danger to fall into; of the occaſions by which we are moſt like to be led to euill; and of the helpes and meanes, with the ſundrie priuiledges of a Chriſtian, which we haue to withdraw vs from the ſame; and ſometime of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> any particular branch of any of theſe, and the corruptions of the heart, and of the Chriſtian armour: of ſome of theſe or of the like matters, let meditation be raiſed before prayer be entred into, if it may be.</p>
               <p>And becauſe meditation is much out of vſe euen among Chriſtians, and therefore it will be found the harder matter to go about and take it in hand; I haue therefore ſet downe <note n="*" place="margin">In Treatiſe <hi>3.</hi> at the end of Chap. <hi>6.</hi> Of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</note> ſome meditations of all ſorts, both briefly and in larger manner to helpe thoſe, which without helpe cannot draw matter from their owne experience to meditate vpon, as I haue before ſet downe a ſhort Treatiſe about the ſame; that through the helpe of both, they may want nothing about this dutie and Chriſtian exerciſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſo that their hearts be framed and fitted thereto. This part of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, namely prayer, confeſſion of ſinne, thankſgiuing and meditation, being conſcionably and carefully vſed and gone about before thou entreſt into thine affaires and dealings in the world, thou ſhalt, in no meane ſort, be prepared and enabled to paſſe the day in thy ſeuerall duties doing, as thou art directed. All which may be well diſcharged and performed (after they be once well vnderſtood how they ſhould be practiſed) in one quarter of an hower, and leſſe if need be.</p>
               <p>And by this thou mayſt ſee, what this part of the dutie tendeth to, and what it requireth of thee, and how thou ſhouldeſt performe it. And as for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> them, which thinke that the doing of this ordinarilie, is more then is needfull, of whom euerie litle dutie done to God, more then they haue already or do vſually performe, is thought too much; let them know that the gaine is verie great.<note place="margin">The gaine of this is great.</note> And as concerning them, which make a light matter of it, ſaying: that they are not now to begin this exerciſe in the morning, but do and haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued it, and yet they ſee no ſuch fruit to come of it: To ſuch I anſwer, that I feare that to vſe it as I haue ſet it downe,<note place="margin">No common thing to vſe prayer aright.</note> is not ſo common in practiſe, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe do take it to be: or elſe they ſhould not ſay, that litle profit commeth by it. For all ſuch obiecters are vndoubtedly farre from the right vſe of it; and one of theſe wayes they ſwarue from it: that either they come not vnto it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> with an humble and well ordered heart; or they know not how to be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in it; or elſe ſome ſpeciall ſinne is in the way to cauſe that it cannot <hi>as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,</hi> aſcend vp to God. The leaſt of theſe faults may eaſily hinder the profit and darken the beautie of it.</p>
               <p>I doubt nothing, but that at ſometime diuerſe Chriſtians in an holy and right manner do diſcharge it: but reuerently and confidently to do it, laying
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:16851:189"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all other things aſide which hinder it, that I dare not affirme of many: which cauſeth the benefit of it, the leſſe to appeare to them. Which kind of men, if they cannot conſtantly tye themſelues to it with delight, when yet they may very well, they ſhould ſhame and put themſelues to rebuke, for omitting it through ſlouth and vnwillingneſſe; if by no other reaſon, yet by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of ſome of the deuouter ſort in popery: who although they ſerue God ſuperſtitiouſly, yet they obſerue their houres appointed to them after their blind maner (hauing only a confuſed and deceiueable hope to be heard, I ſpeake of the beſt of them) to the ſhame of ſuch as who knowing better how to worſhip God aright, thinke it too much to tie themſelues to any thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> more then they vſe to do: and that is, when they thinke good, or be driuen to it in ſickneſſe, feare, &amp;c. or in any other maner, (many times) that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the right and true properties of it: and then ſometime I graunt, and that in the morning (perhaps) they betake themſelues to it.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer it be with ſuch: the holy Ghoſt hath greatly helped the frailtie of Chriſtians hereby, who are by naturall corruption (cleauing faſt to them) prouoked in the morning as ſoone as they are vp, to be raunging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the world, and according to their delights, dealings and occaſions to be caried after them, either in vanitie of mind, and lightneſſe; or in vnqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, contention, quarrelling and worldlineſſe, <hi>minding litle</hi> for the moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> part <hi>but things earthly</hi>: and entring after this manner into the day, do for the moſt part go further fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God all the day after. For this cauſe the holy Ghoſt hath taught them, that they ſhould preuent theſe daily inconueniences, by taking vp their minds and hearts to farre better vſes: that is to ſay, that after their awaking with God, they ſhould (if it may be) repaire to God more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely, which is done by meditation of Gods power, mercie, &amp;c. by thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe for benefits receiued and promiſed, by freeing themſelues from guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of Gods wrath, by confeſſing their ſinnes, and praying for the benefit of forgiueneſſe, and for grace in the day againſt the euils thereof, and for good gouernement throughout the ſame; that they being well ſeaſoned thus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> in the morning, they may retaine the ſauour, and hold the ſtrength of ſuch a gracious beginning (as I haue ſayd) all the day after.</p>
               <p>And (to ſpeake more plainely) that they being thus well fenced with this ſpirituall reuiuing of their minds, and hartening of themſelues againſt all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, before they enter into the field with their enemie, they may be well armed againſt the batterie of temptations and prouocations, which will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly meete with them: and ſo keepe their liues from the force of them, and from hurt by them in farre better maner, then ſuch can do, who being naked and deſtitute of this furniture, do lie open vnto them, whatſoeuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt they haue of their owne wiſdome and ſtrength.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And this which I haue ſayd being well conſidered, I do not ſee what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception can be brought againſt this part of dutie, vnleſſe anie will further ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell about the time, which I ſaid need not be much, after we haue well learned how to beſtow the ſame. To the which I tye no man, hauing ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed what time the performance of ſuch a dutie doth require: and otherwiſe, I leaue it to all to conſider, whether their willingneſſe, ſufficiencie in gifts, and their leiſure will yeeld more time, or not ſo much; ſo as there be a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:16851:190"/>
diſcharge of the dutie, in ſuch ſort as they may reſt therein with peace,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and may feele themſelues more fit to walke warily, and ſtrengthned againſt the dangers which fall out in the daie: which they in no wiſe ſhould doubt of, if they do it ſincerely. And now I haue ſaid of this ſecond dutie what I haue thought conuenient to him which deſireth to vſe it to his profit; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him that is ignorant, how to practiſe it; and exhorting him that (through neceſſitie of importunate buſineſſe at ſome time) is conſtrained to omit it in the firſt beginning of the day, that yet afterwards he watch his beſt leiſure and oportunitie to performe it: and laſt of all, anſwered obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as I haue ſeene it expedient.</p>
               <p>This onely remaineth to be added: that we muſt conſider, that theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> (which here I ſet downe to be as oft performed as they may; and of which this is one) do ſerue to keepe &amp; ſettle vs in the practiſe of the daily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection before mentioned. Whoſoeuer therfore deſire to reape the fruit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by that which I haue ſet down, knowing how to vſe it, but yet being often neceſſarily hindered; let them performe it when and as oft as they can: but they which are free from ſuch buſineſſe, ought fully to reſolue and determine with themſelues, daily to performe it if they be able; and not ſlouthfully, nor for the fauouring of the fleſh to neglect it, as oft as they feele themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to vſe it: for then ſmall fruit is to be hoped for, as I haue ſayd before. Neither indeed, can any ſuch omitting of it be any way excuſed, ſeeing we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ought not at any time to be vnwilling to ſuch duties, (if it were alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to be with the Lord in this manner) vnleſſe we could proue to our conſciences, that we are taken vp in things more neceſſarie. Neither can this deſire be quenched in vs (which the ſpirit of God hath kindled) but by our owne fault, whiles we haue through lightneſſe, raſhneſſe, or in ſeeking ſome other vnlawfull libertie, expelled and baniſhed the ſame from vs.</p>
               <p>But for as much as all other duties go well forward, whiles the heart is kept in loue and liking with theſe holy exerciſes, and not otherwiſe (for pray well, and liue well; and contrarily:) therfore this grace and heauenly affection cannot, neither may well be wanting in the ſeruants of God. Inſomuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> that they which are not neceſſarily letted (as, by pouertie; or otherwiſe, as want of leiſure) are not to make this to ſtand in ſtead of their familie exerciſe in the morning (as being loath to beſtow more time in ſuch holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, then they muſt needs:) but rather they muſt begin the day with this after they are riſen, and afterward with their houſhold as the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie ſhall permit; I meane, as it will beſt ſtand with euerie ones buſineſſe in the familie. And eſpecially preachers and ſtudents, and thoſe which do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy many &amp; great means, and who are not holden downe with pouerty, and ſuch multitudes of outward calamities and hinderances, and whoſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements be but ſmall in reſpect of other mens; ſuch (I ſay) ſhould not offer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to God ſo nigardly ſacrifices, as they who can do no otherwiſe: but as they haue receiued more, many wayes then their brethren; ſo they ſhould render more then they, both in this and other duties: for otherwiſe, who ſhould be examples and patternes to the weaker ſort, if ſuch ſhould not? and yet that I may diſcourage none, he that ſhall offer but <hi>his mite</hi> (with the poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow) willingly, hauing no more, hath done as much as any other who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:16851:190"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> greater gifts haue made longer prayers. Now if after the declaration of this dutie in this maner, ought remaine doubtfull: let them ſeeke reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at their faithfull teachers hands, that ſo they may more freely and with more profite continue it.</p>

               <p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE third dutie concerneth our callings and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar trades, the which we may be fit and readie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon, when our minds be thus well prepared, as in the two former duties hath bene declared. Know we therefore that with this well ordered heart we are to take the ſame in hand, euery one as he is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, throughout the day ſo long as is expedient, that we may ſafely and comfortably bring it to an end. About the which argument my purpoſe is not to write a treatiſe of all matters appertaining hereto, but ſo farre to ſpeake of it, as I may ſhew that which I intended, namely this: ſeeing it is a great part of our life, to doe the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> workes of our callings, and a chiefe part of a godly life to do them aright, therefore to direct a Chriſtian how to pleaſe God in the ſame; contrarie to the opinion of many, (and thoſe not of the worſt) who imagine (but moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly) that their calling is ſuch a let to them from the practiſe of religion, that thereby (though they had no other) they are hindred from ſeruing God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. But they ſhall better be anſwered hereafter.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore I will proue,<note place="margin">Three points handled in this chapter.</note> that all Chriſtians muſt liue in ſome lawfull vocation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they muſt with practiſe of other godly duties, faithfully and diligently walke in the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Thirdly, (which will follow vpon the two former) that they who do ſo, which the children of God only can do, may highly pleaſe God therein, and find great helpe and furtherance thereby to paſſe the other parts of the day well and chriſtianly.</p>
               <p>And for the firſt of theſe three,<note place="margin">The firſt point: All muſt liue in ſome law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling. <hi>Gen. 3.19. Epheſ. 4.28.</hi>
                  </note> it is cleare by the words of the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (<hi>In the ſweate of thy face thou ſhalt eate thy bread:</hi>) that all men are bound to trauell and labour (though not with the hands) in ſome painefull eſtate of life, wherein they may ſerue God, and if need be, they may <hi>prouide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and theirs.</hi> At leaſt wiſe, they may be good members in the Church and Commonwealth, as is meete for them to be, not idle and vnprofitable. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Vnto the which rule the higheſt magiſtrates do ſubmit themſelues, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God to their places, that the people <hi>may liue a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſtie</hi>: and therefore very vnmeete it were, that any inferiour to them,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 3.6.</note> ſhould raunge and liue without compaſſe in the world <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately,</hi> as though they were exempt from the Lords gouernment. But I, as I haue ſet my ſelfe to do throughout this booke, will deale onely with thoſe who hauing ſubmitted themſelues vnto the will of God in other things, are
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:16851:191"/>
therefore readie to heare his voice in this.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/>
               </p>
               <p>All ſuch muſt know and religiouſly perſwade themſelues, if through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and long cuſtome therin they ſhold think otherwiſe, that they muſt of conſcience betake themſelues to ſuch an eſtate of life, leſt otherwiſe liuing without a calling, as rogues, theeues, couſiners, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon gameſters, paraſites, &amp; other diſguized perſons,<note place="margin">The daunger of not liuing ſo.</note> they ſhould loath labour, liue vpon others, &amp; waxe idle; and ſo runne either into hereſie, ſects, curious queſtions, and fond opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or elſe into looſe behauiour, and wicked companie: and then finding no ſauour in their religion, ſhould fall away from the truth, and grow ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, <hi>and frozen in their dregges and filthineſſe.</hi> As, not onely we may reade in the Scriptures, that ſome haue done, which alſo were members of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Church: but haue ſeene many carrying good ſhew of zeale, and hauing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good parts in them, whereof ſome became prophane and vaine in their liues: others held ſtraunge opinions, and ſeparated themſelues from the Church of God, amongſt whome they had liued familiarly before; neither were they to be blamed by men with any reprochfull crime, which might be like to bring them thereunto, ſaue onely this, that they exerciſed no calling, <hi>but went about from place to place,</hi> and ſetled themſelues in none, neither could be perſwaded by the deareſt of their friends ſo to do. But although a man could aſſure himſelfe,<note place="margin">All ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the liuing without a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> that he ſhould neuer fall to ſuch a depth of ſinne, through the neglect of a vocation and following of a lawfull trade of life (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> there ſeldome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth any better fruite therof:) yet, what man wold but ſo much as liue vnprofitably (if he may be well employed) when God hath made him for a farre more excellent end? and bring diſcredite and ill report, and that iuſtly, vpon himſelfe, hauing bene had in good account before of his godly neighbours and brethren; or liue inordinately, and ſo voide of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and that for neglecting the ordinance of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>2.</hi> point: Men muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour diligently therein.</note>But to ſay no more of this firſt point: the next and the nigheſt degree hereunto, that may be, is; that many walke looſely and careleſly in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and are ſlouthfull and negligent in the performance of the duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (whereas they ſhould faithfully and diligently be taken vp in their honeſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> and lawful vocation:) which comming either of the ignorance of their duty, or of a mind too much giuen to ſeeke carnall libertie, or of both; cannot be without daungerous diſcommodities. For what ſhould the multitude of Chriſtians do through the whole yeare, if they ſhould not euery one walke and be daily occupied in ſome certaine eſtate, ſome at home, ſome abroad, and therein haue triall of their faith, patience, and obedience? not that they might thereby waxe worldly minded and the further from God, but get en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſerue him better as ſhall be ſaid afterwards. For God in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing but one Sabbath of all the ſeuen dayes,<note place="margin">Men ought to be diligent therein, ſeeing they haue ſixe dayes thereto in the weeke, and but one Sabbath.</note> hath ſufficiently declared, that they cannot attend onely to ſpirituall actions, as prayer, meditation, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and ſuch like: and therefore hath for the moſt part of the weeke appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to ſhew foorth their knowledge and religious keeping of a good conſcience, in being occupied about things of this life in their honeſt calling, wherein they may haue worke enough to be employed and taken vp.

This regard muſt be had of all Chriſtians, and of all ſorts both of rich and poore, one and another, in their earthly dealings, (though it be a leſſon moſt hardly learned) that whiles we auoide ſlouth and idleneſſe on the one ſide; yet walking in our callings we be not worldly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the other ſide: that it may come to paſſe, that our calling being one part of Chriſtian obedience and dutie to God, may not onely for the time while we are occupied in it, witneſſe well to vs, that we pleaſe him; but alſo make vs more fit to other chriſtian duties after: and that we ſeeing this maner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of paſſing our time to be enioyned of God, (who hath promiſed bleſſing thereto, and ſeeth what is good for euery one) and conſidering duly with our ſelues the infinite fruite that commeth thereof, we may more willingly, and of conſcience betake our ſelues thereunto: that ſo we may find in this faithfull walking in our calling, a peaceable courſe of liuing here, which may bring happines with it in the end.</p>

               <p>Now to the end we may thus chearefully go about them, as knowing that God alloweth ſuch workes of ours, and ſo thereby be diſpoſed more readily to other parts of dutie, (which we ſee to be no common thing in the world) firſt this muſt be conſidered:<note place="margin">Ioſ. 1.8.</note> that it is the Lord that ſetteth vs in our callings, and hath promiſed to be with vs, and to giue vs good ſucceſſe in them, and to helpe vs beare all tediouſneſſe therein; and further,<note place="margin">By what means our callings may further vs in godlineſſe. <hi>Coloſ. 3.24.</hi>

               <p>But to leaue this, I may not omit one other obiection,<note place="margin">The third ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> which is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men: that whereas I haue taught, that if a man be neuer ſo good a labourer, and diligent husband, and ſo walke painefully in his calling, yet none of all this commendeth him to God, if he be not religious alſo; men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and ſay, that ſuch of all other are moſt negligent in their buſineſſe; as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> by name, who (they ſay) when their minds ſhould be vpon their worke,<note place="margin">Some vvill haue no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants that are religious, to do their vvorke.</note> are found oftentimes at their booke and at prayer; other of them ſitting idly, and litle regarding their maiſters aduantage: whereas they who occupie not themſelues about religion, but are held in by feare, or drawne on by hope of reward, are for their maiſters profit, and go to their worke luſtily. Wherupon ſome haue gone ſo far, that they haue vſually vttered this ſpeech: that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they make choice of ſeruants, they will neuer chuſe any which are reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. Which latter ſpeech (I anſwer) if it were not added,<note place="margin">Anſvver.</note> the former part might more charitably be interpreted.</p>
               <p>For it is not to be denied, but that as in other ſtates,<note place="margin">Many ſeruants that profeſſe, are hypocrites. <hi>2. King. 5.</hi>
                  </note> ſo there are many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> among ſeruants, who make profeſſion of religion, as <hi>Gehazai</hi> and many did whom we reade of: againſt whom I denounce by the word of the Lord, that they ſhall beare the puniſhment of their iniquitie: But to grow to this abſurditie from thence, that all religious ſeruants are ſuch, and that they would not chuſe ſuch to be ſeruants to them; the leaſt ſinne that it can be made, is: that it is a raſh and a carnall ſpeech, and ſo much the more faultie, by how much he that vttereth it, goeth for the better Proteſtant. For ſuch declare that ſo their buſineſſe be done, they can beare any rudeneſſe, brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſorder in their ſeruants, and ſo the diſhonoring of God thereby: for all ſuch behauiour muſt be looked for, more or leſſe, in ſuch as are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But commonly ſuch maiſters are iuſtly met with by the ſeruants, whom they ſo preferre before thoſe which are religious.</p>
               <p>Againe, whereas they in that ſpeech condemne all which profeſſe, it is well knowne, that there are manie ſeruants who in their particular calling, in that they are ſeruants; as well as in their generall, that they are Chriſtians, do glorifie God highly, and ſhine as lights in their places to the ſhame of their accuſers. And yet ſuch maiſters might iudge of their ſeruants religious and chriſtian practiſe by their owne, that all dutie is not by and by to be looked for at their hands, which haue ſome loue and liking of the Goſpell. Are they themſelues ſo vnblameable in their whole courſe, that others may not ſee as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> great wants and faults in them, as they ſee in ſeruants? It is to be feared, that ſuch (who will ſo ſpeake as I haue ſhewed) do not giue them alwayes the beſt example: but if they do; let them catechiſe them alſo, beſide the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke teaching which they inioy, who being alreadie willing to liue chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly, yet if they be not diligently and louingly taught, cannot ſo ſoone be brought to any great perfection.

                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:16851:195"/>Laſtly, of mens vocation this I adde: that I haue not ſo vrged the neceſſitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of laboring in it, but that if ſome through extreame pouerty &amp; want of ſtocke be inforced to giue ouer occupying, as hauing no other remedie (through the hardneſſe of their harts, who will forgo nothing to the reliefe &amp; ſetting vp of ſuch &amp; the multitude of other poore folke) if it be thus (I ſay) that they haue no other remedie, nor be able to labour in any lawfull calling, they may with the peace of their conſcience receiue almes &amp; pleaſe God therein, keepe their confidence in him, and grow forward in the further knowledge &amp; practiſe of their dutie, as other Chriſtians do (though this which I ſay, ought to be no ſhelter for the ſlouthful and idle.) Which thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g if many were perſwaded of (as it is pity that any ſhould doubt of) they ſhould beare their poore eſtate more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> indifferently; and the ſhame that many haue of it, more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentedly then now they do.<note place="margin">Note.</note> For that is now their calling to truſt in God, and to hope for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, which ſhall be ſufficient for them, as they did before their decay.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, neither would I haue any to thinke, that this which hath bin ſpoken, doth ſimply denie a chriſtian man libertie to alter and change his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: which although it ought not haſtily nor lightly be done (ſeeing it is very probable, that a man may be beſt able to deale in that, wherein he hath bene trained vp and experienced) yet vpon neceſſitie and the decay of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer trade<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 16.3.</note>, and vpon other ſufficient and waightie conſiderations (of which ſort there may fall out many) he may inioy libertie ſo to do: which to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſet downe in this place, were too farre a departing from the point in hand.</p>
               <p>And thus much be ſayd of this matter concerning mens outward vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whereby among other things this may be ſeene, that although the moſt do complaine that they are much hindred from a fruitfull walking with God, by their earthly callings; yet that is their error, or ſome way their great ſinne: for a man fearing God may preſerue faith and godlineſſe by a warie &amp; Chriſtian walking in them, &amp; practiſe many chriſtian duties in the ſame; as patience, &amp; truſt in God, &amp;c. and conſequently may pleaſe him therein to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of his owne hart. And therfore, if any man find his calling to be a let vnto him from ſeruing God religiouſly, and well ſpending of the day, let him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> know, that the hinderance of him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this is in himſelf: euen ſome vntoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, intemperancie, and rebellion of his hart, either becauſe he knoweth not how to vſe his calling aright; or elſe, becauſe he hath giuen himſelfe too much liberty to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> folowing that which he knoweth. But otherwiſe, if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor to incourage himſelf by the afore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to vſe it aright, he ſhal ſee euery day more clearly much cauſe to praiſe God for the proofe of his loue to him and bleſſing ſo many wayes therein (ſo farre off ſhall it be from being an encombrance vnto him, as moſt complaine that they find it:) yea, I dare be bold to aſſure him, and that by the Lords owne teſtimonie, (for to him that hath, ſhall be giuen, and he ſhall haue abundance) that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſhall find by a conſcionable diſcharging of dutie in it, much libertie and holy boldneſſe with God. So that, this third rule of a religious walking in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, reaching to ſo great a part of our life, though it may ſometime be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 8.18.</note> is (we ſee) much to be regarded; and other duties of equall neceſſitie, when that muſt wholly or in part be intermitted, muſt be performed. But this is to be vnderſtood according to the helpes and incouragements, that
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:16851:195"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> euery man hath one more then another, thereafter he muſt be more fruitfull: that none may be diſcouraged on the one ſide, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cannot do as he wold; or made ſlouthfull and negligent (when he might do much more) on the other. Thereafter (I ſay) ought euerie man both in his particular vocation, and in all other points of Chriſtianitie, bring foorth more fruite: as,<note place="margin">The miniſter hath more meanes to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him by his calling, then a priuate man.</note> the Miniſter in reſpect of his calling, which is to be occupied in reading and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of other, and whoſe labour is a meane to helpe him forward in a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, becauſe it is an acquainting of him with the Scriptures and the mind of God ſo properly, as cannot be ſayd of other mens labours: the miniſter (I ſay) in ſuch reſpects, oweth more dutie to God (which he may alſo be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> able to performe) then the priuate man. So the wealthy man,<note place="margin">So the vveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, rather then the poore.</note> in that he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not be carefull or penſiue about neceſſaries, (but it is his great ſinne if he be) hath more liberty to remember God, and to ſet vpon duty with chearfulneſſe, more then the poore; who is through meere neceſſitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to his great griefe, to cut off many times of reading, conference, and of publike hearing (which for the moſt part, the other need not:) though he be not thereby diſcharged from fearing to offend God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And whereas men alleadge, that the rich is letted by reaſon of his wealth, and therefore cannot ſo eaſily apply himſelfe to walke in a ſound courſe: not what he doth, but what he ought and may do, is to be conſidered. For as he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſhall ſhew himſelfe vnthankfull to God in groſſe manner, who ſhall thus go about to make Gods bleſſings, ſtumbling blockes and hinderances from har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie loue and obedience to him, and from libertie in his ſeruice more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can haue: ſo he ſhall neuer do it but to his great coſt. In like maner they, which dwell among many good neighbours, who are as watchmen to them, and haue an ordinarie teaching miniſterie that can build them vp, are to ſhew themſelues more rich and plentifull both in the exerciſes of religion, and in the particular duties which belong to Chriſtians, then they can do, which want either the moſt, or all of the meanes which others enioy.</p>
               <p>And according to this equitie, the auncient Chriſtian, who through long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> experience is better acquainted with the louing kindneſſe of the Lord, ought in better ſort diſcharge himſelfe of the fore-mentioned and other duties, then he who is a nouice, and a young ſouldier in this ſpirituall warfare. Therefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> writing to the elder Chriſtians to put them in mind,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 2.14.</note> vrgeth them by the ſame reaſon, ſaying: I write vnto you fathers, becauſe ye haue knowne him which is from the beginning. As if he ſhould ſay: Ye haue experience, that it is no labor loſt to ſerue him: but ye hauing had acquaintance with the godly life, and the bleſſed fruite of it from your youth, ye are able vpon ſo good and long triall, both to proceed conſtantly your ſelues in your courſe, and alſo to hearten on the yonger.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> And the ſame I ſay of all others, whoſe part hath bene greater in peace, health, freedome from diſeaſes, in holy fellowſhip (eſpecially of mariage) or in whatſoeuer other bleſſings of God:<note place="margin">Note.</note> they (I ſay) who haue inioyed more bleſſings of God then other of their good brethren, ought by good right to go farre before them as ſhining lights, both in variety of duties, and in more gracious performance of the ſame; and ſooner returne when they perceiue themſelues to haue wandred, and more firmely to ſettle themſelues to hold

And although a man may be both in his calling and in companie at once; yet, as I haue ſhewed how eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ought to be conuerſant in his calling, without reſpect had of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: ſo now I ſhew particularly, how companie ſhould be vſed without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of mens callings. Now as the companies be of many ſorts with which we are occaſioned to be occupied, and the matters infinite which fall out to be debated of in the ſame; ſo can there not therefore any certaine and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> rules be giuen to direct our ſelues in them: but yet ſome generall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruations may helpe vs much; the rather, ſeeing they to whome I direct my ſpeech and who may take profite by this, haue attained to the heartie deſire of keeping a good conſcience alreadie, and haue (for a great part of them) ſome meaſure of ſound knowledge of the will of God, which will greatly further them in the ſame.</p>
               <p>And becauſe all companies among men are not for and concerning traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke in earthly dealings, and matters about this preſent life, as bargainings and couenants:<note place="margin">Company meet in diuerſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects:</note> but ſome are among neighbours and friends, partly for the increaſing of loue, and partly to make merrie; and otherſome by other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and ſome by accident without any purpoſe thereof before: in all which kinds, we often take much hurt, and be in farre worſe caſe by them for want of good direction and heed-taking, then we were before we entred into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Firſt therefore I will ſpeake of thoſe companies,<note place="margin">Eſpecially two.</note> wherein we haue more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to benefite our ſelues one by another to God-ward, as hauing no weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dealings to hinder vs: and then of the other which belong to the affaires

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and dealings about this preſent life, how to vſe them.</p>
               <p>In both which generally,<note place="margin">A generall rule in both.</note> this is a generall rule to be obſerued in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies: That we feare daunger, and be harmeleſſe in them and without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, leauing no ill ſauour by example behind vs: but more particularly,<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in ſome.</note> the marke which we are to ayme at in all our familiar companies is this, That wee ſhould not ruſh vnaduiſedly into them as moſt men do, but determine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to do good in them to others as we be able, and to helpe them forward vnto eternall life by all good oportunities we can; or purpoſe to take good of others, as occaſion ſhall be offered.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> This rule (to make no doubt of the former, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.7.8.) is according to the Scripture, that as we ſhould draw vnderſtanding out of them,<note place="margin">Pro. 20.5.</note> whom God hath plentifully enriched with it: ſo we ſhould be moued with pitie and compaſſion towards them, who are ignorant and careleſſe: or though they were neither of both, yet many wants and infirmities at leaſt they haue, as we our ſelues haue;<note place="margin">Col. 3.12. 1.

               <p>And to what great purpoſe ſhall it be to inioyne watchfulneſſe ouer the other parts of our life, if in companie we haue not an eſpeciall regard of it, thereby to take all good oportunitie to make our companies profitable? For daily experience teacheth how many occaſions of offending God, and of troubling our ſelues are offered and occaſioned therein: and were we not better be abſent one from another, then in ſuch ſort meete together?

               <p>The moſt tolerable communication amongſt the reſt, which is vſed, is (as I haue ſaid) to be deepe in and about the world and matters of commodity;

               <p>And therefore what is more needfull about our companie, then to haue it euer in purpoſe to learne and get ſomewhat where we may in companie: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to helpe forward others, which we may do any good vnto, as we are able; or to make ſome other good vſe of it?

               <p>The ſimplicitie of the times hath bene ſuch,<note place="margin">Much more this ought to be infamilies.</note> as men haue met louingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this manner, prouoking one another thereunto: but it is iuſtled out with a proude conceipt of their owne wiſedome, who count it too baſe now to conuerſe together after ſuch a manner.

               <p>But ſeeing there ought to be no leſſe vſe of all theſe fruites of companie betwixt the godly Paſtor and his people,<note place="margin">Alſo betwixt the paſtor and people.</note> then amongſt thoſe whom I haue mentioned: therefore let the former rules moſt eſpecially be obſerued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſomewhat more; that is to ſay, mutuall conſent betwixt them, that their conference be of the things which are moſt fit for the eſtate of the perſons: which, by good warrant from God, (who requireth ſuch wiſedome, labour and loue) and approued experience of men, ſhould be after this manner: That ſuch as are ignorant, and yet willing to be taught, ſhould be taught (queſtion-wiſe) the grounds of Chriſtian religion, and the way how to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſaued, and to amend their liues.

with by them for their inſtruction, about any particular doubts in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whole religion and true worſhip of God; and in confuting the contrarie: or about any point touching conſcience in the practiſe of dutie. I will not ſay what gaine the teacher himſelfe might reape hereby, beſide the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, neither are many haſtie to proue: but oh times! oh dayes! yea, oh people to be lamented: ſo happie by the long raigne of thy Prince and continued peace, as thou mighteſt haue bene; and ſo litle of this fruite to be enioyed, or Chriſtian dutie practiſed! The beſt thing, euen the pearle and tidings of the kingdome, to lye as wares out of requeſt, not asked after, and that through vanitie and folly! Theſe and ſuch like, (as God hath giuen wiſedome to both parties) ſhould be endeuoured after betwixt the paſtor and people, when no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> other neceſſarie things do hinder: which maner of meeting were (no doubt) like to be as a ſtrong band to tye them in loue and chriſtian peace together. And this I haue ſeene, and that not in one place nor two: but I muſt ſay, as it bringeth a ſweet life, ſo the diuell layeth many blockes in the way to hinder it; that while they liue ſtraunger-like and conceipted one with another, or looſe, worldly and vnprofitably, they may be as others be, who haue no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Goſpell. For let men thinke and ſay what they will, there is not one halfe of the benefite that might be enioyed, no not of many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors themſelues, by the preaching of it.</p>
               <p>But to proceed: it is an harder thing for a man which feareth God, to haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> vſe of this rule before ſet downe,<note place="margin">Hard to make good vſe of meeting in ill companie.</note> that is, the libertie of good talke in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, when he ſhall by occaſion light among ſuch as are not of his owne mind; and the worſer the perſons be, the harder. It will be counted harſh, if not ridiculous, among ſuch whoſe tongues (as they ſpeake) are their owne, to vſe them as they liſt, though the beſt way be taken for entring into it.</p>
               <p>Here therefore, another conſideration is to be had of vs for the making of beſt vſe of the time:<note place="margin">How we ſhould go about it.</note> namely, that we waite for ſome fit occaſion to be offered by ſome of the company; which (though they purpoſe no ſuch thing) will from their talke ariſe, if we attend vpon it as <hi>Paul</hi> did before <hi>Agrippa</hi>: if not, then ſpeake we of the workes, iudgements or bleſſings of God which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> them, or freſh in memorie; by the which we may in as wiſe a manner as we can, vtter ſomewhat to the holding out of euill at the leaſt: and further it ſhal be expedient to like and commend that which is well ſpoken by them,<note place="margin">Act. 26.28.</note> the rather to faſten vpon it, ſo farre as it may be done without ſuſpition of flatterie, and hurtig of them. By which manner of dealing, I haue oft ſeene the euill which began among men, and appeared; to be ſtaied and ſuppreſſed: and attendance giuen to better communication, being wiſely and kindly offered.</p>
               <p>But here, loue towards them muſt ſhew it ſelfe, which will make our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſeeme ſmall to vs,<note place="margin">Note.</note> while we ſeeke all oportunities to winne them, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> whiles we are content to forgo our owne pleaſures &amp; liberties in other talke, that we may do good to them. To this purpoſe, it were meete that when we ſhould reſort to any ſuch company,<note place="margin">How to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our ſelues to that.</note> yea or any other, we ſhould bethinke vs of ſomewhat before; as of ſome good queſtions among them, of whom we might learne; and ſome other good matter fit for edifying, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhould require, it being ſuch as we might do any good vnto: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:16851:198"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſeeing godly communication is ſo ſeldome in place, but baniſhed vtterly from moſt companies. This may be thought of many, who go for good Chriſtians, ſomewhat too much, to haue ſuch regard of others: but it is (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) ſlouthfulneſſe and want of loue, not to ſeeke the good of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and ſelfe-loue, to ſeeke that which pleaſeth the fleſh, in trifling out the time, with the neglect of the good of others and our ſelues.</p>
               <p>The which if Preachers of the Goſpell eſpecially, and other Chriſtians would conſider, I know it would be farre better with the people, and much more good done in many places, then there is now for want of it, and they themſelues ſhould haue no cauſe to repent it. And though there ſhould be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> no great likelihood of any good done thereby for the preſent time,<note place="margin">VVe ought not to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying talke by any occaſion. <hi>1. Theſ. 5.11.</hi>
                  </note> yet ought we not for all that to be diſcouraged, foraſmuch as we are commanded to vſe edifying talke: and we ſee, that good things take not alwayes effect by and by, but afterwards in time, as the Lord ſeeth beſt, it may preuaile with them; as alſo we may ſee it appeare in many in ſome part of their life, and in others, (many times) at the day of their death: and yet if no good ſhould be done is it not to be liked that euill is remoued?</p>
               <p>But if men which feare God, be not reſolued to ſeeke ſuch profitable and Chriſtian vſes of their meetings, in ſome ſort when they may be inioyed: I would wiſh them to thinke,<note place="margin">Better to be at home in our calling, then abroad to do vvorſe. <hi>Eccleſ. 5.2. Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12.36.</hi>
                  </note> that it ſhall be better for them to attend vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> their familie and their affaires and charge at home, rather then frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany much abroad, ſeeing in much common talke there is much ſinne, and for idle words men ſhall giue an account. I graunt that neighbourhood and loue amongſt Chriſtian men, is nouriſhed by meetings; as, feaſtings together, and ſuch like: but theſe are not hindred but much helped, whiles our tables, after we are refreſhed and haue ſhewed tokens of loue therein, be ſeaſoned with good communication, and a carefull regard had to keepe out that which is euill and needleſſe: and if there be any to whom this is vnwelcome, who perhaps will not be thus directed in the vſe of company-keeping, let him ſet downe a better, and I ſhall be well pleaſed in his refuſing of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and direction, and with all my heart learne of him.</p>
               <p>And as for them which obiect: that they haue not bene acquainted with ſuch communication when they meete, and therefore looke not after it; they ſhould rather bluſh at their ignorance, and want of experience in ſo manifeſt a duty: for our talke ſhould be to the edifying of the company:<note place="margin">Col. 4.6. Ioſ. 1.8. 1. Tim. 4.12.</note> and all ought to follow their teachers in it, who are commaunded to be examples to their flocke in the ſame: <hi>Be an example in communication.</hi> Neither let any pleaſe themſelues in this, that they will not looke after ſuch preciſeneſſe: It were more to be commended and better to be liked, if they had ſayd, They were ſory, that they had not their benefit in ſuch a ſweete libertie,<note place="margin">A vviſe and ſauorie ſpeech of a learned man.</note> as God hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vouchſafed vs. It was the ſpeech of a learned godly man: I neuer depart out of company, where I haue wholly omitted good ſpeech hauing oportunitie, but I am checked and accuſed.</p>
               <p>But to go a litle further: if it ſhall fall out that we be to our griefe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as beſet with ſcornefull, prophane and brutiſh perſons, ſo that we ſee no oportunitie nor place for any good, it ſhall be our wiſedome to keepe our ſelues from hauing any fellowſhip with their vnfruitfull workes of darkneſſe;

               <p>And to ſhut vp this fourth dutie, let this be added: that not onely in our companies we be harmeleſſe and giue good example; but euery way and in all our dealings with men, whether they be priuie to it or no, innocent and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> iuſt to all, and mercifull and pitifull to the needie and oppreſſed:<note place="margin">Note.</note> and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that we are ſo naturally giuen to regard and ſeeke our owne profite, whoſoeuer ſuſtaine loſſe thereby; and therefore to be alwaies thus reſolued, that rather then any ſhould haue iuſt occaſion to complaine of our iniurie or hard dealing, we are readie to depart from ſome peece of our owne right, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did to <hi>Lot.</hi> And becauſe it is moſt mens calling,<note place="margin">Gen. 13.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.</note> euery of the ſixe daies to haue dealings with ſome other, therefore let the true Chriſtian arme himſelfe with this mind, euen thus to liue and conuerſe with them in all that they haue to do with them: for many of them are ſo deceitfull and vnconſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, that they will abuſe the moſt innocent and honeſt Chriſtians with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſlaunderous tongues and falſe reports, if they cannot get what they would at their hands.

I ſpeake to thoſe which haue vnderſtanding to iudge diſcreetly, and to whom nothing that I ſay, ſhould be harſh or vnſauorie; as hauing receiued from God a wiſe and vnderſtanding heart to diſcerne, and a promiſe of ſtrength, and therefore ſufficient incouragement to do his will in this part of their life readily and gladly, rather then to deſire with earthly minded perſons to range <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> after noiſome and vnlawfull liberties.</p>
               <p>Indeed I do not deny, but that as we cary fleſh about vs, which is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to weigh vs downe, ſo we ſhall neuer diſcharge this duty, nor ſo purely follow this direction for the well taking vp the time when we be alone, as were to be wiſhed: but yet for all that, we muſt learne and indeuour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the rules which are giuen vs, and that daily better and better, and not to ſuffer our ſelues to paſſe ſuch times ſecurely and without regard, or full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of well beſtowing the ſame as we are directed, although we ſhall not attaine fully to that which we would. For if this be intended of vs faithfully, as euery one is inabled of God, we ſhall not need to repent vs of the time ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> paſſed: but we may haue peace in that which we go about.</p>
               <p>And what ſhall we aime at in labouring to be thus directed, more then the deare ſeruant of God <hi>Dauid</hi> did,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.14.</note> who as he prayed God that the words of his mouth might be alwayes acceptable in his ſight in what company ſoeuer he ſhould come: ſo did he likewiſe, that the meditations of his hart might pleaſe him, whereſoeuer he ſhould become.

And let all know, that it commeth from a moſt dangerous cuſtome of giuing their hearts libertie, (when they are by themſelues alone) that they range af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> what fanſies and folly they liſt in company, and that they are ſo vntoward and vnwilling to betake themſelues to better vſes. And ſuch muſt do as they, who in eating and drinking haue ſtuffed themſelues ſo full, as that they are prouoked to vomite. And moſt lamentable it is, that after ſo long inioying of the Goſpell, there is ſo litle acquaintance with, or gouernement ouer the manifold diſorders and vnrulineſſe of the heart, when God hath giuen vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding hearts, to looke after and thinke vpon things which are excellent. But this complaint is made in another place.</p>
               <p>That which remaineth to be ſayd of this point (Vſing our ſolitarineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right) is, that as I haue ſet downe the rules by which we ought to be guided <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> herein: ſo I giue a ſhort caueat, or watch-word about the ſame.

               <p>Finally, for the vſe of ſolitarineſſe in renouncing things vnlawfull,<note place="margin">5</note> thou art to beware, if at any time when thou art alone thou entreſt into the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the manifold ſinnes which raigne in the world, and ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as do ſometime much ſnare and take hold of thee, that thou be not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> allured and drawne to like of ſome of them, whiles thou goeſt about to refraine and waine thy ſelfe from them by muſing on them.<note place="margin">2.

For thou art blind through thine owne ſelfe-loue and corruption: but eſpecially when the diuell goeth about any ſuch matter, he will blindfold thee more ſtrongly, that thou ſhalt ſee that which liketh thee, in ſinne;<note place="margin">Note.</note> but not that which will ſlea thee: and the ſtrength of thine affections, being ſet on fire by a deepe impreſſion of that which they like, will more forcibly hale thee forward, then a bare weake deſire to auoide the ſinne, ſhall be able to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hold thee backe. And if thou beleeueſt not this, thou haſt (I dare warrant thee) found it ſo alreadie; and howſoeuer thou thinkeſt that thou hateſt ſin, thou ſhalt be drawne vnto it againe, vntill thou perceiueſt that thou art woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, vnleſſe (which is worſe) thou be hardened.</p>
               <p>To this end remember, how <hi>Iuda</hi> going foorth about a lawfull and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thing, namely: to ſee his ſheepeſhearers, intending no euill;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen. 38.18.</hi> Euen while ſin is diſliked in ſome ſort, it is reuiued.</note> yet becauſe he went not armed, he defiled himſelfe by the way with an harlot. To the like end many more examples may be brought. And hereof it is (to illuſtrate that which I ſay, by an inſtance or example) that ſometime ſuch as haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in malice with their aduerſarie, do (vpon better conſideration) purpoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> to agree with him, and pray, that they may no longer beare hatred: but euen then (a thing worthie to be marked) the manifold iniuries, vnkindneſſes and indignities are ſo amplified by the diuell, which their corrupt heart alſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth full well to aggrauate, that they rather depart after their prayer with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing ouer their aduerſarie, then ouer their ſinne; and being ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt him, they be very ſlaues to their ſinne. So haue many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of good hope, oft times by themſelues reaſoned &amp; debated in their harts,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:16851:205"/>
how they haue bene haled and drawne to vncleane deſires, till they haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> bene checked for their ſinne, miſliked it, and accuſed themſelues for it, &amp;c. and yet at the ſame time, (ſo couertly Satan worketh) or at the leaſt ſoone after, haue either ſet forward and reuiued ſuch vnruly deſires, or (which is worſe) haue nouriſhed them and ſo runne further. So I may ſay of all other iniquities that which I haue ſaid of theſe, that while they purpoſe alone by themſelues to thinke how ſhamefull and odious their ſinne is: yet for want of good experience and due conſideration, they ſuſpecting no ſuch daunger as the diuell intendeth againſt them, he ſendeth them away many times either as ill armed to reſiſt it as they were before; or elſe ſo handleth the matter, that they grow to a further liking and entertaining of it.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>
               </p>
               <p>And is it any maruell? For when they are thus ouer-matched by Sathan, (that while they go about to thinke of the renouncing of their ſinne, they are brought contrarily to like of it) this diſadua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tageth them ſore much more, and holdeth them more ſtrongly in feare and perſwaſion that they ſhall ſtill liue in bondage and ſubiection to it, then if they had neuer at all gone about to reſiſt it:<note place="margin">A ſimil.</note> as he who maketh a fray, when he hath proued the ſtrength of his enemie, and hath felt and perceiued his owne weakeneſſe to be farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he looked for, is much diſcouraged from attempting the like another time. And many of theſe ſleights are in our common aduerſarie the diuell, which diuerſe true hearted (yet vnexperienced) Chriſtians not knowing nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> being acquainted with, are much aſtoniſhed when they firſt proue it to be ſo, and are diſcouraged for long time after when they ſee what hard ſucceſſe they haue had. And it muſt teach vs all to come better armed then that we ſhould thinke, with a bare deſire to ouercome our ſinne, or in hauing onely a cold miſlike of it: theſe weapons fray not ſo mightie and ſubtile an enemie. But we will take no knowledge of it, and that we haue neede to walke in feare alwaies: and therefore we muſt of neceſſitie ſmart, for that we would not be warned, till we ſay as many haue ſaid: Oh that we had bene wiſer. Therfore both at ſuch times when we enter by our ſelues into the conſideration of our ſinne, to the end we may grow further out of liking with it, and at all other <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> times let vs indeuour to follow that which hath bene ſaid concerning this point, namely: that we deale wiſely in our owne behalfe, as by the former cautions we haue bene aduiſed.</p>
               <p>Thus in ſome ſort I haue ſhewed how we ſhould looke to our ſelues when we are alone, and how we ſhould be occupied in that time of the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are free from the workes of our calling and from companie, that is to ſay: In keeping our ſelues from idleneſſe and vaine wandrings, and if it may be in doing ſome good, at leaſtwiſe readie and prepared thereto, that we may alwaies euen alone as in companie ſuſpect our ſelues, and paſſe our time in feare, and be mindfull of Sathans enterpriſes. Alſo ſuch caueats or cautions as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> I haue thought needfull, I haue added, whether we be occupied about things lawfull, or things which are holy in our ſolitarineſſe, or in auoyding things which are euill: and if for all that which I haue ſaid of directing vs to the well ſpending of the time alone, it ſhall not be able to perſwade ſome, I thinke it the beſt way to ſhame them with the examples of the heathen Philoſophers, and to ſend them to learne of them, who refuſe to be taught of the Scriptures.

               <p>But let vs heare another which was before <hi>Tully,</hi> whoſe example is recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of him, and of that wiſe man <hi>Cato,</hi> expreſſed in his owne words, thus: <hi>Publius Scipio African,</hi> the firſt of that name, was wont to ſay, That he was neuer leſſe idle or vnoccupied, then when he was free from buſines; and that he was neuer leſſe ſolitarie, then when he was alone. Which ſpeech manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declareth, that he did vſe to thinke of weightie matters, when he had laid the doing of them aſide for a ſeaſon; and that he was wont to commune with himſelfe, when he was alone.</p>
               <p>So that, neither he was idle at any time, and yet that he had no neede of companie to find him occupied. And whereas moſt men cannot tell what to do when they haue not ſome worke to ſet themſelues about, but become vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> idle, except their heads be running after ſome euill; he was both profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably exerciſed, and the better quickened and ſharpened by ſuch intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to returne to publike affaires and buſines againe. Therefore (as hath bene ſaid) he by the keeping of his mind occupied, and by ſearching out thoſe things which by muſing and contemplation he attained vnto, was neuer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone or vnoccupied. This was reported of <hi>Scipio</hi> a Heathen, who could occupie himſelfe in no better things then momentanie and earthly; as moral vertues, gouernment of commonwealths, and the ſearching out of naturall cauſes of things: which all are done by mans reaſon.</p>
               <p>But ô wofull people we, that the like cannot be ſaid or truly reported of vs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> who haue ſuch varietie of heauenly things concerning the immortality of our ſoules, the glorious riſing againe of our bodies, and the incomprehenſible and euerlaſting happineſſe, which God hath bequeathed and freely beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon vs to be enioyed of vs, ſome here and ſome hereafter in the world to come, and yet we are ſoone glutted with them! that in our ſolitarie refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and recreations of our minds, we can ſeldom looke vp aboue that which we may ſee with our eyes; as though ſuch heauenly matters had no ſauour with vs, but were weariſome and tedious! This <hi>Scipio,</hi> when he had bene much taken vp in ciuill affaires and dealings amongſt men, could with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight thinke by himſelfe alone of things profitable, of wiſedome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> learning, ciuill gouernment in warre and peace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But we, if we haue taken a litle paine in companie, we giue our minds the bridle in our intermiſſion &amp; ſolitarines, to thinke of that only almoſt which they deſire: and as for ſerious matters we bluſh not to ſay, We wil not meddle with them, but lay them aſide: whereas who doubteth but that (the end of all our knowledge being Vſe and practiſe to keepe our hearts in an heauenly manner ſubiect to our God from time to time) we haue farre greater neede

How rare are thoſe men, and yet ridiculous for their labour, who acquaint themſelues with this meditating of the law of God, and of the infinite varietie of holy things therein, although the man of God, whoſe praiſe is ſo great in the Scripture, could make it his worke both in the day and the night ſeaſon?</p>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing I can no otherwiſe helpe to redreſſe this wretched cuſtome of neglecting this benefite and libertie of oft meditating, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vſing of ſolitarineſſe in them, who might well vſe it: I will ſay no more but pray for ſuch as know not by experience how good and gainefull it is, in ſtead of all idle and vaine wandrings and fantaſies, wherewith they ſwarme <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> for the moſt part when they are alone.</p>
               <p>And I will not ceaſe to bewaile the vnhappineſſe of the men of our daies, who in the vſuall and daily trifling out of their precious time, declare that they are ignorant of their beſt portion, which is, to haue daily communion with God; but are wiſe to deceiue themſelues in forgoing it for folly and ſinne. And therefore it is no maruell, though of many wiſe and learned, yet there are ſo few, which both find an heauenly ſweetneſſe in their owne liues, and are fit to ſeaſon others therewith, becauſe they are not oft and vſuall dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Lord in their ſoliloquies, that is, in their communing betwixt God and themſelues in their prayer and meditation;<note place="margin">Exod. 19.20.21. and alſo ver. 9.10.</note> and in hauing recourſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to him, ſequeſtred from the companie of men, as <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God had.</p>

Theſe two parts of dutie are required, not at ſome one time in the day, (as the firſt and ſecond rules haue their certaine time, in which they are to be performed) but (as ſome of the other parts of daily dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) throughout the day: becauſe there is no part of our life in the day, but it is either exerciſed with ſome croſſe or with likelihood and feare of it; or it is free from both, and enioyeth ſundrie benefits of the Lords; or (that which is the moſt vſuall and common caſe of Gods ſeruants) it is mixed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of both: which of all theſe ſoeuer be our eſtate, we are in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if we be vnprouided for it: I meane; if we be not watchfull in either of them to carie our ſelues vprightly, and before the time of both if we pray not feruently with full reſolution to it. And to ſay ſomewhat diſtinctly and ſeuerally of both, (although it be my purpoſe to ſay as litle as I may, ſeeing I haue by occaſion ſpoken of both in another place:) of the firſt I will ſpeake in this chapter; and in the next of the other.</p>
               <p>It is not hard to vnderſtand what I meane by proſperitie: properly,<note place="margin">VVhat is meant by proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie.</note> euen all pleaſures and delights, which may lawfully be enioyed of the ſeruants of God in this life, as health, riches, friends, peace, mariage, and all that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> thereto, as wife, children, &amp;c. Theſe therefore which are things that a man would moſt deſire, with freedome from afflictions which might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the ſweetneſſe of them,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.23. Iona. 4.8.</note> we muſt know that it is a moſt difficult thing to poſſeſſe them without great daunger to our ſoules: and therefore the liuing in ſuch an eſtate, as to abound in many good bleſſings of God, (which the world counteth happineſſe) is compared to a ſlipperie way, in the which a man is euer ſliding and readie to fall. Now then,<note place="margin">An hard thing to forgo things which we loue well.</note> to looke to our ſelues daily that we be not hurt, what leſſe worke is it, then as if a man iourneying all the yeare through, yea and all his life long, ſhould be conſtrained continually to be looking to his feete and ſteppes? which thing how vnwelcome it would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be and weariſome, if it were but one day, who doth not ſee and perceiue?</p>
               <p>Now the caſe being like in this part of our trauell and ſpirituall iourney; therefore that we may be free from the hurt which might meete with vs herein, theſe two points ſhall be needfull to be conſidered and learned: Firſt,<note place="margin">The tvvo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall points of this chapter.</note> how hardly in proſperitie we walke ſafely from day to day towards the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen: ſecondly, how and after what ſort we may do it though it be hard, and how we may grow to the right vſe of the ſame: which who ſo
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:16851:207"/>
attaineth vnto, ſhall find no common, nor ſmall eaſe in his life ouer others do,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and paſſe by manifold and grieuous dangers which few auoide.</p>
               <p>And firſt, although a man ſhould much better performe all Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties euery day,<note place="margin">The firſt point in this ſixt duty.</note> who hath feweſt afflictions to draw his heart from them, and who hath moſt helpes by peace &amp; wealth, to ſet him forward therein: yet (as men go to worke) we ſee it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly cleane contrary. For by reaſon of this, that men are ſo readily caried to vſe all earthly things amiſſe, euen to their owne hurt and hinderance, and ſo hardly brought to be the better by bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; it commeth to paſſe, that it is found by experience with vs for the moſt part, as we read in ages paſt that it was with men then: that is, the more that a man hath of theſe earthly commodities,<note place="margin">Note.</note> the leſſe he is inriched with ſpirituall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> grace; and as they are increaſed &amp; multiplied, ſo this decaieth and is dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And yet I do not here ſpeake of the wicked of the world (as oft times I put the Reader in mind:) but euen of thoſe which go before others in the imbracing of the Goſpell. For euen of them, many are very faultie and blame worthie in this matter: and therefore they had need to be willing to take knowledge of it by the leaſt watch-word, and amend it; and not tary with the world, till they be ſhamed for it and confounded.</p>
               <p>Yea, and this is the more to be marked, becauſe ſome of theſe, whiles they haue bene vnder the croſſe,<note place="margin">The greater ſinne, to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull in proſperity, vvhen it hath bene purpoſed in affliction.</note> haue bene humble and kept within good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe in their liues, and haue had oft recourſe to God in their prayers (as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> haue confeſſed it was meete for them to do.) But why ſpeake I this? becauſe when the Lord hath giuen them deliuerance, they haue ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to haue bin no ſuch perſons as before, but haue ſoone gone from their former care and haue kicked vp their heele, waxing wanton in their proſperitie, euen as they were forgetfull of their former calamities, Pſal. 119.67. So that it may truly be ſayd, that few by earthly things are drawne on and incouraged to the loue of heauenly:<note place="margin">In ſundry kinds of Gods benefits, litle good done. <hi>Act. 9 31.</hi>
                  </note> which yet is the end that the Lord hath in giuing them. If they haue reſt from perſecution and trouble, and inioy peace in their daies, how many do with the Churches mentioned in the Acts, take the benefit of it; that is, to edifie and build vp themſelues the more ſtrongly in knowledge,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> faith and godlineſſe, and draw others thereto by their example?</p>
               <p>And if their plenty of Gods outward benefits be ſuch, that they may eate of the fat and drinke of the ſweete: yet how many find the Lords ſeruice more ſweete daily to them, then they find his outward benefits? But they do rather after the manner of others, begin to reſt in them many times and to ſay, Here is good being for vs: whereas the more men haue, the more they ſhould looke that they ſerue him with ioy for all their abundance. And further, if they haue time at will, wherein much good may be done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and others,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.16. Pſal. 90.12.</note> is this their chiefeſt care to redeeme it to euery good vſe becauſe the dayes be euill, and to apply their hearts to wiſedome, ſeeing they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> haue but a while to liue? Nay, that were too ſad a matter for them to heare of. But numbers of them take vp a great part of the day moſt commonly in the pleaſures and delights, which are by euill cuſtome in euery ſeaſon of the yeare affoorded.</p>
               <p>Wherein, for the ſatisfying of them to the full, if the publicke duties of Gods worſhip in the familie (which ſhould be daily continued for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

Which complaint, if euer, may now in this generation be made of the better ſort of Chriſtians, and that alſo moſt rightly,<note place="margin">Numbers through long peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity worſe then ſometime.</note> when many of the gentry of this land and others, who had for certaine cauſes iuſtly mouing them, for ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry yeares together baniſhed out of their houſes the vſe and practiſe of dicing and carding, with ſuch prophaneneſſe and diſorder as accompanieth the ſame, haue within theſe few yeares (as though they could no longer forbeare) brought them in againe: A lamentable fruite of their wealth, peace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> among many other ſuch. But if it be duly conſidered,<note place="margin">Oh vvhat good might haue bene done in the time of this long peace.</note> what good might haue bene done through our land in this long time of peace and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and how the oportunitie, euen the time of our viſitation (as fit for holy duties, as faire weather for harueſt) hath bene ouer-ſlipped, (that I ſay no more) it ought iuſtly to wring out plenty of teares for ſo great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
               <p>But I will containe my ſelfe.<note place="margin">Riches, one peece of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, hardly well vſed.</note> Our Sauiour ſpeaking but of one part or peece of proſperity, namely of riches, ſaith: Oh, with what difficultie ſhall they who haue riches, enter into the kingdome of heauen?

And what maruell, ſeeing a rich mans riches are his ſtrong city,<note place="margin">Prou. 18.11.</note> and thereby he is bold to do many things wilfully, which he durſt not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly do if he had them not.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> It was the laſt temptation that the Diuell attempted our Sauiour withall (The glory and wealth of the world, I meane:) to teach vs this, among many other things; That if the other two be ouercome, yet the Diuell looketh to preuaile by this. What ſhould I ſay of the innumerable hurts which euen good men ſuſtaine by theſe benefits and good bleſſings of God, as that they hate one another, contend with and deceiue one another, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſtrangers one to the other thereby: and (which is none of the leaſt euils among other) their harts are ſo knit to them, that they conſider not how they take in hand their worldly buſines, nor how they vexe &amp; trouble their poore brethren (if any fall into their hands;) but go to worke againſt them cruelly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> or at leaſt in raſhneſſe, with which nothing is well done. If we ſhould but conſider how they beate their braines about them euery way, who are yet wealthie alreadie, beſtowing all their wiſedome in deuiſing how to increaſe and bring them in, when it were to be looked for,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.27. Mat. 6.33. 1. Tim. 6.6.</note> that the great riches [god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe] ſhould be much more ſought after: If, I ſay, we ſhould conſider this, we ſhould enter into a very maze. By which, and many ſuch like, it may with bitter complaint be lamented (of the which we haue bin long admoniſhed:)
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:16851:208"/>
that Religion in theſe many yeares of our peace, hath brought forth much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> wealth to the Church, but the daughter hath deuoured and eate vp the mother.</p>
               <p>And that this which I ſay, may not be vnderſtood onely of riches, know we that all lawfull liberties do worke the ſame effects, that men, for the moſt part,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.67.</note> become worſe by them, as in the Pſalme the Prophet declareth: Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, that is, when I had my libertie: and therefore this ſhall ſerue to ſhew, with how much ado they which haue them, walke daily in a Chriſtian courſe; and the rather, the more variety of earthly delights they inioy with them. Now therfore it being thus, what cauſe haue all ſuch as are louers of the truth (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſuffereth to liue in peace, health and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to be wiſe and wary againſt ſo many dangers, and warned by the hurt of ſo many who haue gone before vs? and to learne how they may not be hindred nor holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> backe any way by their proſperitie; but ſet forward rather, and that many wayes, as it is moſt conuenient? The watch-word is not in vaine and needleſſe, which was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our fathers <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 6.11.</note>: When thou haſt eate &amp; art full: beware leſt thou forget the Lord. But I will proceed. Therefore as I haue now declared the one of theſe two points, that is, how hard it is, to vſe proſperity aright: ſo I will go forward with the other, namely how this maybe, that we may well vſe it, that it may be no ſnare nor hinderance to vs.</p>
               <p>And to this end we muſt conſider, how nearely we are knit vnto the ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> as hath bene ſayd,<note place="margin">The ſecond point in this ſixt rule.</note> how naturally we deſire to haue all that our hearts do long after without regard, whether it be good or euill for vs: which cauſeth vs to eſteeme of all ſuch things more highly then becommeth vs, and therefore to ſet our greateſt care vpon them, and to ſeeke to inioy them, whatſoeuer better things we looſe and depriue our ſelues of for them. This inordinate loue which we beare to any lawfull libertie or bleſſings pertaining to this life, muſt be by all meanes poſſible weakned and abated in vs, which we haue too much through our owne folly ſtrengthened and increaſed.

Few <hi>Iobs</hi> do know and find out the deceiptfulneſſe of riches, vntill after they haue proued it, they complaine too late, and in vaine begin to repent, and ſay: We are deceiued.</p>
               <p>Beſides,<note place="margin">The third.</note> it is an eſpeciall good helpe to weaken the loue of theſe earthly things, if we often record, that they are not our owne, but borrowed:<note place="margin">Luke. 16.12.</note> and therefore, as no wiſe man reioyceth for the ſtocke of money which he hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> borrowed of another man, (which he muſt returne home againe) as if it were his owne: ſo it is ſmall wiſedome for vs, who are appointed to ſaluation by Ieſus Chriſt, to delight in and ſet our hearts vpon the things of this life, which are but lent vs, and may euery day be required againe of vs: but our owne riches which ſhall neuer be taken from vs, as the knowledge of God, the loue of our brethren, ioy and peace by the holy Ghoſt; theſe ſhould ſo ſo make vs in loue with them, that the loue of the other might be ouer-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed thereby. Thus if we can thinke of all outward commodities of this life, &amp; hauing this iudgement of them, will daily meditate one time or other of the momentany condition of them with vnfeined prayer to God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and forſake our old loue and acquaintance with them; we ſhould find this knot more and more to be broken, and our thoughts not to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after them with ſuch earneſtneſſe and continuance.</p>
               <p>And if we could poſſibly thinke what hurt they haue done vs,<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> euen our ſelues alreadie (for what vnſetlings from a Chriſtian courſe do we (in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) ſuſtaine, but they are one cauſe of it, if not the onely?) I am perſwaded, if we could rightly thinke but of this one thing, we would abate our greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and put the knife to our throat, as the wiſe man wiſheth in the like caſe;<note place="margin">Prou. 23.2.</note> that is, to reſtraine our appetite. But as experience hath taught, that mens lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoughts are, for the moſt part, better then the former (as they may well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> be, ſeeing they come with more mature deliberation:) ſo it may be ſayd with griefe, that when we haue played the fooles, by letting looſe our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer thoughts to worldly luſts, and cheriſhing of them, we ſeldome haue the grace to light vpon the latter; that is, to digge and weed them out, vnleſſe (perhaps) vpon our death-beds we complaine, when yet oft times it is too late.</p>
               <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">The fift.</note> it would not a litle helpe vs forward to a ſlight and meane eſtimation of all earthly proſperitie, if we would daily accuſtome our ſelues to muſe vpon the examples of ſuch, as haue inioyed the ſundry commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as plentifully as any of vs do, and yet haue bene taken from them, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> ſome of them in their flouriſhing age vntimely; as leauing to the reſt of vs, who yet remaine, a manifeſt ſpectacle of our mortalitie, and a warning of vs to a moderate vſe of them, that we might not iuſtifie the worlds practiſe.</p>
               <p>And it is another ſpeciall meane to the contemning of the world (though it go againſt nature) to vſe to viſite them,<note place="margin">The ſixt meane.</note> as others alſo in their ſickneſſe (as we ſhall be able) and there marke how they then ſpeake of them; that ſo we may ſee, how litle good their commodities can do them, in compariſon of

               <p>Thus I haue in ſome ſort, ſhewed how and by what meanes the loue of all earthly things ſhall be weakened in vs, without the which we can neuer vſe the lawfull pleaſures and profits of this life moderately and rightly: this one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> thing being added, that this aduice be the more carefully and conſtantly regarded, ſeeing the danger were like to be great by the neglecting of it.</p>
               <p>And now vpon this which hath beene ſayd, it clearly and neceſſarily followeth, that if thus we get ſuperiority and dominion ouer our hearts and affections in the vſe of earthly things, then our actions and dealings about theſe lawfull liberties, ſhall be well ordered in the ſight of God and men, to the great quietneſſe and peace of our conſcience: for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is bold as a Lyon. For who doth not know, that as the heart is affected either well or ill:<note place="margin">Luke 6.45.</note> euen ſo it draweth the wordes and workes after it, to be like and ſutable? which is the cauſe why I labour to perſwade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> Chriſtians, to the ſubduing of the luſts and intemperate rebellions of the heart, and to haue in meane reckoning and price all things here below, that they may be the leſſe offenſiue in the whole courſe of their earthly dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. For when we be thus reſolued in our hearts conſtantly, watching thereto, that we (as God hath taught vs) will ſo farre forſake all, as we ſhall thereby be hindred from following our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in any point of his holy commandements; we are ſtayed from manifold abuſings of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as wealth, peace, preferment, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>And when we can containe and keepe our hearts from coueting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring any way to vſe our proſperity vnlawfully, we ſhall neither iniure others <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in any thing that is theirs, nor haue our commodities as ſnares, thornes and choakes to ſtrangle and hurt our ſelues; but in the inioying of all bleſſings of this life, ſhall be ſober and fruitfull in good workes, and more feruently lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging after the treaſures of the paradiſe of God. Which fruits of proſperity few do reape, but runne into exceſſe and paſſe their bounds one way or other: ſo truly it is ſayd, That as it was in the dayes of <hi>Noe,</hi> ſo it will be in and vntill the comming of the ſonne of man: They eate, they dranke, maried wiues and were maried, &amp;c. that is, they chiefly regarded theſe things rather then the manner how, or the end why; and more then they did conſider, wherefore the Lord ſet them in this world. And this be ſayd of the firſt branch of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> this dutie; that is, of the vſing of proſperity, and the lawfull liberties of this life rightly: and how God teacheth his children daily as their ſtate ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to do the ſame accordingly, as it is one of the duties which is of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to be obſerued daily of all that deſire well to beſtow the day, and to giue a good account thereof at the euening and end thereof.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> We are called (and that moſt fitly) ſtrangers: to teach vs, that we ſhould not be medling, nor intangle our ſelues here ſo, as we ſhould be vnready and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to go home. And that is a right ſtranger-like liuing in the world, and an inioying the lawfull liberties of it, that we be made more fit thereby for the heauenly life, and not to linger after any thing here or cling about it, ſo that we being tied to any lawfull pleaſure or profit we ſhould not as free ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of heauen be daily ſomewhat nearer it, and readier to go to it. And do we thinke that they are ſuch ſtrangers, who pleade for ſuch a liberty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing here, that their owne conſciences do tell them that they are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and readie to die? Are they ſuch ſtrangers, who are priuy in their owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> hearts, that their reioycing is moſt for the commodities and delights of this world, eating, drinking, paſtime, mariage, gaine and ſucceſſe in their dealings, &amp;c. who if death ſhould come vpon them, whiles they are in the middeſt of them, muſt needs cry out and ſay: O death, how vnwelcome art thou vnto vs who haue our pleaſure in theſe?</p>
               <p>It is the Lord that ſaith by his Prophet: <hi>Let not the rich reioyce in his riches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 9.23.</note> 
                  <hi>nor the ſtrong in his ſtrength, nor the wiſe in his wiſedome: but he that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, let him reioyce in this, that he knoweth me.</hi> And it is our Sauiour which ſaith: <hi>Woe be to them which now laugh, for they ſhall houle and weepe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 6.25.</note> 
                  <hi>woe be to them which are full, for they ſhall be hungry.</hi> And againe: <hi>Sonne,</hi>

                  <hi>thou in thy life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> time receiuedst thy pleaſure, therefore now art thou tormented.</hi> Laſtly,<note place="margin">Iob. 31.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Iob</hi> that was deare to the Lord, ſayd: <hi>If I haue reioyced for that my hands haue gotten much, and for that my riches are great, euen this were to deny the Almighty.</hi> Therefore know we, that our reioycing ought not to be earthly: yea, as a godly man may not be glad for that he hath much, going no further; ſeeing that were but to be tied to the creature, and to reſt in a broken and a deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtay: ſo neither may he reioyce in any other earthly thing whatſoeuer,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:16851:210"/>
but he ſetteth it as well as riches in the Lords place, from which it ought to be baniſhed. Now the heart of a Chriſtian is the Lords temple and dwelling place;<note place="margin">Pro. 23.26.</note> and he it is that muſt dwell there, as he himſelfe hath ſaid: <hi>Giue me thine heart, my ſonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That muſt be where the treaſure is: it muſt haue no other treaſure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen but him, nor any on the earth in compariſon of him. So that it may be ſeene of all ſuch as deſire to be ſatisfied, that God hath not giuen to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruants earthly proſperitie to naile their hearts to it;<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.25.</note> but to proue them, whether any thing be ſweeter to them then he himſelfe who hath giuen it, that is, whether the gift or the giuer be in greateſt requeſt with them; and that all which he giueth them, might be an occaſion to knit them nearer vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> him; who will yet giue much more to them which depend vpon him: to this end (I ſay) all Gods benefites ſerue.</p>
               <p>And I haue not denyed in all that I haue ſaid, but that it becommeth the beſt of Gods ſeruants to labour for earthly maintenance, that they may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to giue rather then to receiue, and that without any iuſt offence they may do it: and that they ought to acknowledge it for a great mercie of God, that he reacheth out his hand to helpe them with neceſſaries, euen here where they be ſtraungers, and to prouide for their bodily neceſſities; and therefore to be thankefull, yea and ioyfull in this reſpect, that they are freed from much care and diſtruſt, and haue the way made more eaſie thereby to the heauenly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> life: for want whereof many of their deare brethren are in much penſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſorrow. But yet may they not in any wiſe take ſuch ſweetneſſe in thoſe things, that they forget or neglect better: but alwaies remember, that they ſerue to a further end, that is, to ſeeke better; and are not themſelues the end of their hope, in which they ſhould reſt.</p>
               <p>And ſo to conclude: it remaineth that we in no wiſe reioyce, nor put our delight in any tranſitorie thing, but with moſt great diligence we vſe all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefites of God daily and throughout our life, moderately. And this is to enioy our proſperitie aright, and to make that part of our life ſweet and ſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to vs indeed which is paſſed therin. And this is that which I haue thought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> conuenient to be ſaid of this ſixt rule, namely: that it is a great part of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, euery day to looke to this with due regard, that we moderately and fruitfully vſe our lawfull liberties, and all the commodities earthly of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next part of our life not yet mentioned, is that which is vnder the croſſe and in affliction. Our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie here is, that when and ſo often as it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to trie vs therewith, and to chaunge the courſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of proſperitie or any part of it: yet that with the ſame well ordered heart, which I haue ſaid ſhould accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie our other actions and parts of our liues, with the ſame (I ſay) we be prepared to receiue it from him:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.12.</note> and count it no ſtraunge thing to be exerciſed with it; and the rather for this reaſon (as the Apoſtle admoniſhed the godly of his time) that we are predeſtinate thereunto,<note place="margin">Rom. 8 29. 2.

               <p>And all may ſee how needfull it is for vs to hearten on our ſelues by theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and ſuch like perſwaſions,<note place="margin">How we may beare our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions rightly.</note> to be willing to beare our croſſes meekly &amp; with chearefulneſſe, becauſe we do ſo ſoone ſhrinke backe at the hearing of them,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 11.8.</note> as the Apoſtles did when they heard that their maiſter would go into <hi>Iury</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, where the Iewes before had ſought to ſtone him; and ſeeing they be ſo vnwelcome to vs by nature, although we be ſubiect to many and ſundrie,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.11.</note> and that daily. It muſt not be with vs, as it is with the moſt: that is, that we loue not to heare of them when we haue bene awhile free from them, and ſo hope ſtill for earthly peace, of the which we haue no promiſe: but reſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded euery day, that our heauenly Father knoweth what is beſt for vs; and as he ſeeth affliction or freedome from it to be meeteſt, ſo he will alwaies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> bring it to paſſe.</p>
               <p>To this end we are admoniſhed of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Lament. 3.27.</note> to accuſtome our ſelues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to beare the yoke in our youth, that we may be the better acquainted with it when it ſhall be put vpon vs: that ſo we being tamed and ſubdued by it, and our proud and rebellious hearts brought vnder of him, we may beare it with the more eaſe and comfort; encouraged hereby, that if we be able to beare afflictions contentedly, and with quiet and meeke ſpirits, (which is the hardeſt part of our life) we may eaſily prouide, to haue our whole life ſweet and ioyfull.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, to this end that we may be readie to waite vpon the Lord <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> patiently in our chaſtiſements,<note place="margin">Iob. 1.6.</note> we muſt conſider that euery day Sathan inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth miſchiefe againſt vs, and he knoweth our weakeneſſe to be greateſt in bearing the croſſe, and therefore will not leaue vs vnaſſayed as much as in him lyeth: and not ſo onely, but alſo will terrifie vs with this perſwaſion, that they be greater then they are, and feare vs with the oft and much thinking of them, that our ſorrow may be increaſed. Againſt all which his curſed vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining of vs, we hauing ſo great encouragement from the Lord, ought to be
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:16851:211"/>
thus ſtayed: that ſuch of them as we can, we may auoide; and the reſt, we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> may go vnder contentedly, waiting for a good iſſue, euen as in faith we pray for it:<note place="margin">Reu. 3.19.</note> ſeeing our God will haue vs perſwaded, that of very loue and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he correcteth vs whenſoeuer we be corrected of him. But becauſe we faile many times in obſeruing theſe rules, and therefore find not grace then, to beare them aright, whiles they are vpon vs: nor afterwards get any wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, experience or comfort thereby; we muſt diligently and faithfully marke,<note place="margin">VVe muſt marke how we be affected in and vnder the croſſe.</note> how we be affected vnder them: that if we ſhould be oppreſſed with confuſed and vnprofitable heauineſſe, diſtruſt or any other daungerous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we might learne before, that they be no fit companions for vs; and ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner get out of them, after we eſpie them in vs, and ſo betake our ſelues to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> gouernment.</p>
               <p>And that this labour be thought no more then neceſſarie, we muſt know, that by Troubles we do not onely meane great &amp; vnwonted loſſes, long ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,<note place="margin">Not only great troubles, but alſo thoſe which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, muſt be borne meekly.</note> perſecutions, and ſuch like: but thoſe alſo which fall out verie oft and commonly, as vnkindneſſe and diſcourteſie in neighbours; vnthriftineſſe, vnrulineſſe and diſobedience in children; vnfaithfulneſſe and negligence in ſeruants; diſcommodities and harmes in family matters; with ſuch like: all which to beare, without vnquietneſſe, impatience and vnſetling our ſelues out of the Chriſtian courſe, muſt be thought no meane nor ſmal gift of God; nor without daily and continuall watchfulneſſe and wiſe regard to be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> vnto.</p>
               <p>And I do the rather make mention of theſe troubles, which for the moſt part ariſe in our families as well as other waies, becauſe many Chriſtians do thinke through ignorance, that we are not to be directed in theſe common things, nor to be called to our reckoning and account for offending by impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, anger, back-biting and heart-burning againſt any man, and for ſuch like paſſions: which declareth, that as it is an hard thing for Chriſtians to walk in the vprightneſſe of their hearts,<note place="margin">Pſal. 101.2.</note> by perfourming other duties in the midſt of their houſes; ſo it is no leſſe hard and rare in this bearing of diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and other troubles, to ſhew themſelues lights and examples to the reſt of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> their familie. But theſe vnquietneſſes, which are counted ſmall, are not to be admitted at any time in our liues, ſeeing they vnſettle and draw vs out of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> courſe. Therefore that neither one nor other kind of affliction become vnſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of vs, this counſell we muſt take from the Lord, which I haue now ſet downe:<note place="margin">Luc. 9.23. Iam. 5.10.11.</note> that euery day we arme our ſelues againſt the feare of ſuch as may come, and againſt impatience by ſuch as alreadie are come vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Let vs thinke it no toyle to watch and looke to our ſelues thus, if we may by this meanes be rid of that which is toile indeed, yea greater toile; and eaſe our ſelues on the contrarie, an hundred fold. For we ſhall not onely prouide well hereby,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.5. Pſal. 120.1.</note> againſt thoſe which are preſent: but as experience and proofe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of Gods helpe bringeth hope which maketh not aſhamed; ſo by our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we ſhall find the like in our troubles to come. What ſtrength got <hi>Ioſua</hi> by this,<note place="margin">Experience is a great helpe in trouble.</note> that he had oft times beleeued Gods promiſe, and found that he neuer failed him truſting in his word which he had ſpoken concerning victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ouer his enemies, or deliuerance from them? Inſomuch that he after ſome proofe of Gods keeping promiſe with him, in bringing him ouer the riuer
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:16851:211"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Iordane, in giuing <hi>Iericho</hi> and the citie <hi>Ay</hi> into his hands, in the battell againſt the fiue kings of <hi>Canaan</hi>; he triumpheth in his hope of conqueſt, (the Lord hauing promiſed to him victorie ouer them) and therefore ſaith to his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and men of warre, before he ouercame them:<note place="margin">Ioſ. 10.19.</note> The Lord hath deliuered them into your hands, and therefore be of good courage.</p>
               <p>And what other thing made the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> in great afflictions to ſtay himſelfe vpon God, and to caſt his care vpon him, but this experience and long proofe which he had of Gods tender care ouer him. It was (I ſay) that which made him expreſſe the ſame in theſe words:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.10.</note> God hath deliuered out of great tribulations, and doth deliuer daily, and I am ſure alſo that he will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> deliuer in all time to come. This experience if we haue (as who may not haue it in many afflictions, if he haue reſted vpon God therein?) it ſhall be a ſtrong weapon to defend vs from fainting, diſtruſt or diſpairing, and to keepe vs from vnſetlednes, and able to vphold vs in an infallible hope of a good iſſue, euen before it come. But to this end we muſt hold our ſelues faſt to the prop of Gods promiſes, and lye cloſe to them, as an anker: and thus we being armed, we ſhal ſee the Lords deliuerance for vs, as clearely as we may diſcerne the arrow to flie in the ayre.</p>
               <p>It is a great point of wiſedome, to learne of God,<note place="margin">Jt is our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God in bearing our troubles. <hi>Heſt. 4.16.</hi>
                  </note> thus to beare our trials and troubles, that firſt we commit the ordering and diſpoſing of them to him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> as <hi>Heſter</hi> did, by faſting and prayer of faith: ſecondly, that we vſe all lawfull meanes whereby we may haue a good ſucceſſe and end, as ſhe did in going to the king for helpe againſt <hi>Hamans</hi> diuelliſh deuiſes: and then the third will follow, that God will turne them to the beſt. Theſe three in one ſhort verſe the Prophet ſetteth downe together, ſaying: Commit thy way to God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.5.</note> and be thou doing good, and verily he will bring it to paſſe.</p>
               <p>But if we will not be directed by the Lord in bearing our afflictions, (as the rebellious heart will be ſoone readie to caſt off his yoke) but will take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of fleſh and bloud, as <hi>Saul</hi> and many ſuch haue done,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.3. &amp; 4</note> yea and <hi>Dauid</hi> at that one time (though ſmally to his comfort:) then this ſhall follow, either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> for want of preparing our ſelues meekely for them before they come, or for not thankfully receiuing them when they are come, they ſhall ſore flaight and aſtoniſh vs, and raiſe in our hearts ſuch paſſions and diſtemperature, as will vnſettle our whole courſe and bring vs out of frame. In which eſtate as we ſhall be vtterly vnfit to any ſeruice of God: ſo ſhall we be alſo vnmeet for any Chriſtian ſocietie with men, we being ſo confounded in our ſelues for our vnwelcome troubles, and ſo diſguiſed in our ſpeech, countenance and behauiour, by yeelding and giuing place to the frowardneſſe and vnbridled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our hearts. By all which, who doth not ſee,<note place="margin">How we adde new troubles to the old.</note> that we do both adde new troubles vnto the former, and make them which God ſendeth vpon vs, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> farre more grieuous then otherwiſe they ſhould haue bene? For all who haue experience, can tell, that the intemperance of our hearts, and the impatience which is ſuffered to beare ſway in vs, do raiſe many diſtractions and vexations in our liues, which we might elſe haue bene voide of: and the Lords trials and fatherly chaſtiſements are thereby made farre more irkeſome vnto vs.</p>
               <p>And of this ſeuenth dutie thus much: whereby we may ſee, how neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie it is for vs daily, beſide the well beginning of the day and care for right

               <p>And that we come the oftener and more chearefully hereunto, as oft as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it ſhall behoue vs, we muſt know and conſider, that we haue therein commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and fellowſhip with the Lord, and are admitted to ſpeake and breake our minds vnto him, and ſo haue our ſoules moſt ſweetly refreſhed thereby, as if we met before him publikely. And what is like vnto ſuch libertie, that in a reuerent ſort we may be admitted to ſpeake vnto the Lord, and to haue him make aunſwer to vs againe? So that, it ſhould not be hard for vs to be brought to enioy ſo great commoditie, but rather to count our ſtate the more happie the ofter that we may be partakers of ſuch a benefite.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is meete that we ſhould in this ſort haue our recourſe to him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> daily, to the end that our whole conuerſation may ſauour of him; that as all aboundance of heauenly odours (that is, of ſpirituall grace) do flow from his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Maieſtie to all that are about him and by the prayer of faith come neare him, more fragrant then <hi>Aarons</hi> ointment: ſo we being conuerſant with him in this heauenly manner, may hereby, as by a ſweet preſeruatiue, keepe our ſelues from all annoyance of Sathan and the world. And therefore it is no wiſedome for vs to be long from him in this manner, eſpecially hauing ſuch free acceſſe vnto him whenſoeuer we liſt. This reaſon ſhould the eaſilier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs, becauſe we ſee how by occaſion of earthly dealings, our earthly
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:16851:213"/>
minds draw vs to be altogether earthly: in our talke one to another, churliſh,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> hote, bitter, or light, prophane, raſh: and ſo in our behauiour teſtifying no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a worldly mind. And is any thing more to be deſired then the chaunging of this courſe? But what is fitter then this, when we ioyne daily together in ſuch holy manner againſt it, euen there where the faults are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? And thus I hauing ſhewed, that there is no cauſe why we ſhould thinke much to tye our ſelues daily as we ſhall be able to theſe duties, weigh now a litle what companions we haue in the Scriptures in the performance of them.<note place="margin">Examples.

                  <hi>Abraham</hi> is renowned of God for his diligence and faithfulneſſe in the perfourming of theſe exerciſes of religion in his familie: for inſtructing them, and therefore (no doubt) praying with them, ſeeing all things are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſanctified by the word and prayer,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Act. 10.2.</hi> Cornelius.</note> thankes, and the teaching them their duties. And <hi>Cornelius</hi> hauing this commendation in the Scripture, that he feared God with all his houſhold: and beſides, that he was giuen much to prayer; hath left ſufficient teſtimonie, that both he prayed with his houſhold as well as priuately by himſelfe alone, and alſo that he laboured and vſed the meanes of inſtructing the ſame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might bring them to that feare of God which was in them. Therefore ſeeing ſuch worthy ſeruants of God haue gone before vs in the performance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of theſe duties in their families; and ſo haue continued them (as there is no doubt) as they haue ſeene their daily neceſſitie to require, and that they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſingular fruite thereby: therefore it ſhall be neceſſarie for vs, oft and vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to meete together for the priuate worſhipping of God in our familie the whole together, be it ſmall or great.</p>
               <p>For this may all ſee and eaſily know, that God hath commanded that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and fathers of families ſhould rehearſe his lawes continually vnto their children,<note place="margin">Deut 6.7.</note> and (as it were) whet their memories with them by talking of them in their houſe, and when they lye downe, and when they riſe vp, and to bring the word of God into familiar acquaintance with them: which is no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> more then he ſaw neceſſarie for them.</p>
               <p>By the which commandement we may ſee, how this latter age of ours is degenerated from the holy cuſtome of religious exerciſes in our families, which were in vſe ſo many thouſand yeares agone. For there can be no time found throughout the day, nay the whole weeke, in many Chriſtians hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to be occupied about ſuch matters; and yet (which maketh their ſinne the greater) how are they letted from them? by more weightie occaſions? No: but partly through ignorance, ſo that they could not; through the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling out of the time in idle and vnneceſſarie talke or folly: and partly through continuall taking vp of it in one worldly thing or other, or nouriſhing tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chineſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and ſuch like;<note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.7.</note> by which their prayers (as well as all other good things) are broken off: whereas they ſhould do it by themſelues alone alſo, rather then neglect it with their houſhold; the Lord ſo requiring of vs the one, that we ſhould do the other alſo; and not ſo tyed vs to one time, that we ſhould looke after it at no other, (for it ſhould be oft times, as we heard in Deuteronomie:) but thereby teacheth vs in wiſdome to appoint to our ſelues
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:16851:213"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſome certaine time or other for that his ſeruice, leſt we ſhould obſerue no time but omit it altogether.</p>
               <p>And as for the fruite of this dutie, if it be perfourmed with reuerence of vs as the Lord himſelfe hath taught vs,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.24.</note> it is an opening of the doore of his treaſurie vnto vs; as we who haue any experience, can truly ſay: That by it we haue not bene meanely enriched. So that ſuch prayer and holy exerciſe is ſutable and anſwerable to the other parts of chriſtian dutie which are to be perfourmed throughout the day, as by the other duties before mentioned may appeare. And ſo our prayer (as I ſaid before of the vſe of it in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) ſhall be an helpe to godly life, to make vs liue better: and our good life <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> an helpe to our prayer, that we may pray more feruently.</p>
               <p>Therefore (to ſay no more of this point) becauſe I haue before ſet downe after what manner we ought to pray, and preſent our ſelues before God in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Chriſtian exerciſe, if we purpoſe and indeuour conſtantly to continue the ſame about euening and morning; there remaineth no more but this, that we take heede to our couenant indeed, and that we breake it not off by euery light occaſion: neither giue place to ſuch lets as Sathan will raiſe vp in our way; as, by the vntowardneſſe of our heart, by ſleepe and ſlouthfulneſſe, the comming in of ſtraungers, and occaſion of ordinarie buſineſſe; neither vſe it for faſhion: yea and this let vs know, that if the ruler of the family performe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not this dutie, yet is the Chriſtian familiſt to perfourme it by himſelfe.

               <p>The words of the Lord, which I alleadge to this purpoſe are theſe: <hi>Be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie,</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A reaſon.</note>Now we know, that other ſinnes are in a like deteſtation with God that anger is; and therefore that they muſt be no more ſuffered to abide within vs then it: and conſequently, if we be priuie in our ſelues to any like ſinne that we haue offended, we ſhould expell and driue out the ſame as poiſon, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> lodge not, nor remaine with vs. And to doe this, it is neceſſarie that we take ſome conuenient time to vs, both to ſearch and enquire what we haue done, and withall to purge ourſelues from it accordingly.</p>
               <p>But here if any thinke that this was not intended of the Apoſtle, that wee ſhould before we fall aſleepe, conſider how we haue paſſed the day; neither will I preciſely vrge the houre or time ſo particularly: (for indeed he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

And is any time ordinarily and for the moſt part fitter for that buſineſſe, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue ended the day? except ſome ſpeciall ſinne committed in the day do require a more ſpeedie examining of our ſelues before.<note place="margin">Iob. 1.9.</note> And if <hi>Iob</hi> (as we read of him) did euery day of his childrens banquetting together, offer ſacrifice to God and pray for them, and commaund them to cleanſe their hearts and ſanctifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, (for ſo it is ſaid that <hi>Iob</hi> did euery day) adding this reaſon, Leſt they might therin offend God: is it any maruell, if we in our own perſon do retaine this care euery day, and vſe this practiſe?

There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt this dutie ſo much, as the prophane cuſtome of the world, to whom all goodneſſe and controlling of their licentious courſes is vnſauourie, and therefore vnwelcome and ridiculous. But let ſuch go: know we, that if we deſire to giue an eaſie reckoning to God at our latter end, it is our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and the beſt prouiſion we can make for our ſelues, to yeeld with all conſcionableneſſe, a reckoning to the Lord at the end of euery day: and ſo much the rather, becauſe we loue no after reckonings to be brought againſt vs; which may iuſtly be feared, when we haue not indeuoured faithfully to do the ſame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day to day, but are accuſed by our conſciences,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that we haue dealt too ſlightly; yea hollowly ſomtime, &amp; too much fauouring our ſelues in paſſing by many particulars, which we were willing to be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; buried.</p>
               <p>That which we may reade in heathen Poets, as <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and others concerning this matter,<note place="margin">The heathen poets did vrge it.</note> may and ought worthily to put to ſhame a number of Chriſtians. They wrote, that a man ſhould looke backe at the end of the day, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> how and in what manner it hath bene ſpent and paſſed: which cogitation (it is to be feared) hath not once entred into the heart of many, which profeſſe to know God in Chriſt. For ſuch as ſee any cauſe of going about it, this I will ſay to helpe them forward: that the more circumſpect they haue bene in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of their wayes, and the more diligently the gouerning of the hart and life be kept throughout the day; the more readily and willingly ſhall they go about this view of the day-ſpending at their lying downe: neither ſhall
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:16851:215"/>
it be caſt off, or neglected and vntowardly taken in hand, but when they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> haue bin too ſecure &amp; ſlight in doing the duties of the day. Neither would I lay vpon any a burthen, which they be not able to beare: calling God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that I ſeeke in this as in the reſt which I haue ſayd, onely the glory of God, and the further peace and comfort to all the faithfull, and the high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and eſtimation of a godly life, which will be much ſet by where the life is ſo looked to in the day as I haue wiſhed, and at our lying downe viewed in this manner: and therefore wiſhing euery one according to the light and grace which he hath receiued to conſider, whether he can ſay any leſſe but that they walke moſt ſafely &amp; moſt confident, who go about (as they ſhall be able) to make an end of the day in this maner. And the reaſon why this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> as the laſt worke beſide prayer in the familie, is, becauſe a Chriſtian hath ſomewhat to mention and deale about, and complaine of particularly concerning himſelfe, which he cannot ſo well be ſatisfied in, when he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in company. And he that hath moſt warily looked to himſelfe in the day, and ioyned with the family in duties of humiliation at night, ſhall ſee cauſe inough to adde this duty to both: as we reade it written of Maiſter <hi>Bradford,</hi> (who had much inward communion with God) that he was neuer ſatisfied in the duties he did through the day, and namely in praying at the Chappell (when he was fellow of a colledge) and in his chamber with his puples, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he had alſo powred out his heart to the Lord by himſelfe alone. But yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> notwithſtanding this which I haue ſayd, ſpeciall regard ought to be had of the many bodily infirmities, diſeaſes and ſickneſſes, with the feebleneſſe of mind, ignorance and other incomberances, which Gods deare children ſhall be afflicted with: for they cannot doe as other may, and therefore as euery one ſhall be more oppreſſed then other, ſo he muſt needs be the more reſpected. For in ſuch caſes the bare lifting vp of the heart to God ſincerely, is as much; and mercy (I know) is better then ſacrifice: but withall, this muſt be graunted, that the more godly euer one is, the more he will bewaile his wants, and ſo this among the reſt; which doth no leſſe in a well ordered heart, then a kind purgation, diſcharge the ſoule of all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſuch droſſe as remaineth to waite him a miſchiefe. Thus I haue more largely, as I haue thought it expedient, gone ouer theſe parts of the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, which for the moſt part are euery day to be done, the better to direct him therein: and ſo likewiſe I haue ſayd that which I intended of this whole Treatiſe. It remaineth now to ſee how the practiſe of it is by Sathan and our ſelues broken off and hindred: which is in the next Treatiſe to be ſet downe and handled. But firſt, I thinke good to adde theſe two things: The one, that as I haue ſet downe rules for daily direction: ſo for the helping of the weaker ſort ſome example alſo be ſhewed vnto them thereof: The other, what vſe is to be made of the whole Treatiſe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is the loue of God, which conſtraineth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth vs to loue him, and therefore to indeuour to obey him; ſo the wicked who are not beloued of him, cannot loue nor ſerue him: therefore it were infinite, and not to my purpoſe here, to make a large diſcourſe of this, What lets hinder them from the ſame, ſeeing it is no one particularly, but many which hold them from a godly life, as alſo from faith. But ſeeing the moſt of the impediments which hinder them altogether, are alſo ſtops and ſtayes to Gods deare ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, ſo that they be not ſo cleare lights in giuing good example as they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> might, and as were meete for them: therefore for the better furthering of them in the way to a godly life, I will by that occaſion lay foorth ſome of them which hinder both: but chiefly I will ſhew how the poore children of God be holden backe, and ſo become more offenſiue; and giue ſuch helpe as I can againſt the ſame: for that is the point which I propound in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to acquaint the Reader with. And firſt to ſay ſomewhat generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed.</p>
               <p>He that faithfully vſeth the daily direction ſet downe before, or the like,<note place="margin">He that is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doctrine is in litle dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> ſhall be furniſhed daily with the munition that a Chriſtian ſhall need againſt his greateſt enemies, and (as I haue ſaid) ſhall find reſt to his ſoule daily: which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> otherwiſe is not to be found nor enioyed conſtantly of any, neither the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and felicitie of a godly life in any ſort poſſeſſed as it may. For though I dreame of no perfection in this life, yet he that walketh in this royall way, ſhall not doubt where he is, and whether he be out of his way; as other ſhall from time to time: he ſhall be accompanied throughout the day and from day to day, with faith, hope, loue, humilitie, meekeneſſe, righteouſneſſe, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, patience, temperancie, ſomewhat armed againſt trouble, hauing
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:16851:220"/>
the word (according to the meaſure of his knowledge and faith) readie to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> guide him what to follow and what to refuſe.</p>
               <p>Now therefore it might ſeeme needleſſe to ſay any more about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And indeed this I ſay, that he who is ſetled firmely in the practiſe of that which is before ſet downe, ſhall find euery day leſſe to hinder him then other, and the Chriſtian life more eaſie to him. But becauſe we are not ignorant of Sathans enterpriſes (who,<note place="margin">But they muſt know what dan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers will be in their way.</note> as he is firſt hardly caſt out, and with much ado: ſo he is afterward more fierce and ſubtill to hinder ſuch as haue eſcaped his hands) therefore I will not beare the reader in hand, that this direction, or the like, will be as eaſily obſerued and kept conſtantly, as read and learned, leſt he finding it otherwiſe, ſhould be diſcouraged and ſet further backe: but as I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> haue ſaid of the parts alreadie, with how much ado they ſhall be practiſed; ſo I ſay much more of the whole, that ſeeing it is a chaining vp of the vnruly thoughts and deſires of the heart, it will at the firſt ſeeme the more difficult. But although they eſcape that firſt plunge (I meane, not to renounce and caſt off the practiſe of it altogether through the difficultie and hardneſſe which ſeemeth to be in it, but will conceiue hope that God will ſtrengthen them to abide conſtantly therein; which is a great conqueſt:) yet they muſt know, that there will fall out very many lets to hinder and hold them backe one time or other, and one way or other, to make the doctrine which ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, without fruite vnto them. The diuell (as I haue ſaid) will lay ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> blockes in their way, to hinder them from going forward in and after this courſe of liuing by faith daily.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, there are ſome which deſire to pleaſe God from their harts though not acquainted with any direction how to be guided, but come farre behind them:<note place="margin">The weaker and the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Christians must be helped.</note> we muſt therefore ſeeke, how to proppe vp and bring on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are thus weake, as well as giue rules to the ſtrong; and indeuour to bring them by litle and litle to this eſtate, as well as teach the other how to keepe in the good courſe which they haue attained to. Finally, we muſt in a wiſe and tender regard of their frailties (as forgetfulneſſe, earthly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">Chriſtians must learne how to returne when they are gone out of the way.</note> coldneſſe, ſlouthfulneſſe, alſo of their ignorance and other wants of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> experience) teach them (as God hath taught vs) how to riſe when they are fallen, &amp; to come into the way when by occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are gone out: that thus they may not be too much diſmayed by their infirmities, but rather ſtrongly encouraged to haue better acquaintance with the life of a Chriſtian, ſeeing there are ſo many helpes, meanes and incitements thereto granted to them by God. Alſo to make them better ſee themſelues, the vileneſſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in them, and Sathans malice and other of his properties, how many things he layeth in their way to make them ſtumble thereat: that the reading of theſe may hold them from ſecuritie, and from faintneſſe and wearineſſe (in their Chriſtian courſe) whereto they are moſt inclined of themſelues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> though they were ſet forward thereto by no other.</p>
               <p>Now although, as oft as a man practiſeth not this or the like daily directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is certaine that he is letted; yet euery one ſeeth it not to be ſo by and by, neither how or by what he is letted; much leſſe how to redreſſe it: therefore is this place and treatiſe of the lets moſt needfull, to ſhew what lets will lye in our way to hold vs from following good direction, and from practiſing
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:16851:220"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> of the Chriſtian life daily; that they being knowne, may be preuented and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided, ſo farre as we may haue peace, (which ſhall be, if the rules for dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting vs be carefully obſerued:) or at leaſtwiſe if we be hindred any manner of way, yet we may ſee how, and ſo hauing remedies at hand, we may be glad to repaire ſpeedily vnto them, and thereby returne into the way againe.</p>
               <p>And therefore I haue thought it expedient to ſignifie the ſame in this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, and that my purpoſe is, to ſpeake in the whole treatiſe following, of theſe and ſuch like matters of purpoſe, for the helpe and comfort of ſuch as cannot yet find the Lords yoke to be eaſie, nor his commaundements plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſweet vnto them at one time as another, in one point as in another, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but toileſome and burthenſome. So that although I haue in the firſt treatiſe ſaid ſomewhat particularly for their ſakes, as I could take fit occaſion to do: yet becauſe I know that many who are willing to liue well and chriſtianly, do make a toyle thereof, and do not find any great pleaſure in the duties of it; and therefore make queſtion oftentimes (ſeeing they find it ſo hard) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were beſt to go forward, or no; eſpecially when they haue bene driuen to commit any ſhamefull ſinne: therefore I thinke it very expedient to remoue theſe daungerous thoughts, and ſhew them ſome way to come out of this vncomfortableneſſe.</p>
               <p>Now the maine and chiefe lets are, the diuell with all his force, ſubtiltie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and malice; and our euill hearts ſo farre as they are vnreformed: and by means of both, all things in the world, though not in their owne nature, but by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made occaſions to vs of falling and offending God. Whereby may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what I meane by lets and hinderances in this treatiſe,<note place="margin">VVhat is meant by lets.</note> euen whatſoeuer may hold vs backe from peace with God. Now all theſe and euery of them is able to breake off our courſe in godlineſſe, that we ſhall not bend our minds otherwiſe then in ſome generall ſort and manner to worſhip God, and liue with men: and although they preuaile not ſo with all, that they breake off their courſe altogether, yet ſome one part or other of the godly life ſhall be neglected; and ſo one day after another, it ſhall continue with them in ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> wiſe, that their reioycing in the Lord ſhall faile, neither ſhall their light ſhine amongſt men, whereby God might be glorified. In this darkneſſe and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage the moſt part of Gods people are holden: ſo that although they haue ſome litle ſight of redemption, and dimme hope at ſome times that their ſinnes are forgiuen them, yet neither enioy they their part in this any long time, nor their ſweet libertie in godlineſſe, which they ſhould haue in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; both which the Lord hath graunted to enioy, as I haue ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They muſt therefore learne carefully to reſiſt all ſuch lets, as they ſhall know to ſtand vp in their way to hinder them: of theſe therefore I meane to giue a taſt, and of the chiefe and moſt of them, that we may ſee and diſcerne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> them, and ſhew ſome helpe againſt them.</p>
               <p>And firſt generally I will ſet downe the properties of the diuell, as,<note place="margin">Firſt, of lets in generall.</note> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, ſubtiltie, crueltie and the like, by the which in ſundrie ſort he worketh vpon the hearts of poore Chriſtians, and deceiueth them infinite wayes: and together with theſe, I will ſet downe the encouragements which God hath giuen them againſt the ſame, which be farre greater then many of them do thinke.</p>

And hereby it is alſo, (of him I meane) that we can deale about nothing but we may poſſibly, and be oft times, ſnared with it: he knowing how to vſe all outward objects to our hurt,<note place="margin">Both by proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſnare vs and by croſſes to vexe vs, at home and abroad,</note> as wealth, beautie, friends, libertie, peace, and all bleſſings; and contrarily, loſſes, ſickeneſſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, &amp;c. If that we be at home, he workes by domeſticall affaires: if abroad, he taketh occaſion from thence. So that whereſoeuer, or whatſoeuer we do or be occupied in, the Scripture teacheth vs, that he is about vs how good ſoeuer we be, if not in vs as in the men of this world: and that which is moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> daungerous of all,<note place="margin">VVhen we leaſt ſuſpect it.</note> he doth moſt craftily deceiue vs when we do leaſt ſuſpect it.

And this is the eſtate of the world at this day; euen thus are all vnbeleeuers deceiued, and holden (as it were) in bands; and cannot, either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſeeke or deſire, or know how to get out. But if any be more expert, and haue their hearts exerciſed in diſcerning good and euill, &amp; how both are wrought and what hindereth both; if God teach them to know this myſterie and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, of Sathans caſting miſtes before their eyes to rocke them faſt aſleepe in ſinne, and haue had proofe of theſe things in themſelues; they ſhall farre more eaſily ſee into it, and know by the helpe that God hath left them, how to

               <p>It is not to be denyed, but that in this manner, Sathan beſetteth all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (though litle obſerued and ſeene of vnbeleeuers) and moſt of all, vs,<note place="margin">Luc. 22.31.</note> whome he is openly and reſolutely ſet againſt.

                  </note> Indeed, this is to be graunted, that euen their weake faith which they haue, is ſweet vnto them; and God doth ſometime ſhew them, how happie a thing it is to be in his fauour and freed from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> thus ſpeaking to them: I write vnto you that beeene, that you may know ye haue eternall life.

               <p>But this I haue ſpoken firſt, that I may admoniſh thoſe who haue found themſelues deliuered from the feare of Gods wrath ſometimes; yet,<note place="margin">Let all weake beleeuers take heed of the leaſt preſumption.</note> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of all boldneſſe and preſumption in the leaſt maner, and to looke care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the preſeruing and maintaining of their faith by all means, and learne to liue by it while they haue Gods word a light to their ſteps: for by it they abide in Gods fauour, and are further vpholden in their Chriſtian courſe; and without it, if they will be bold to venture as litle children without a ſtay, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they ſhall ſoone ſee to their coſt what danger they may grow vnto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they may aduiſedly conſider (their faith and confidence aſſuring them of ſo great good things from God daily) that this loue of God conſtraineth them to giue themſelues ouer to God as they are able: and therefore in reuerence and holy feare to carie themſelues ſo, as they haue the word a lanterne and light to their ſteps,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.105.</note> and to ſuſpect all other boldneſſe to be raſh preſumption; which the Diuell according to his wonted maner and cuſtome laboureth to draw them into, that he may hinder them as much as he can, from inioying the full fruite of their faith here, although he cannot altogether depriue them of ſaluation it ſelfe. In humilitie let them thinke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> baſely of themſelues, that they may keepe farre from this bold preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
               <p>And let not this be ſpoken to the weake Chriſtians onely,<note place="margin">Let ſtronger Christians alſo be vvell armed againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> although they are moſt eaſily deceiued thus for want of knowledge or ſound experience: but let the beſt alſo know, that it falleth out oft times in one houre or day, when men waxe ſomewhat more careleſſe in vpholding faith and a good conſcience, which commeth not to paſſe in manie yeares.

in feare and danger of this,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.27. &amp; 28.

And this let all ſuch take for their remedie againſt that ſubtiltie of the Diuell in drawing them to preſumption.</p>

               <p>And from hence it is, that among holy Chriſtians, (though weake I muſt needs ſay) theſe ſpeeches are heard: What muſt we euer beleeue, and daily hold our faith? as though this were a matter not heard of, and a ſpeech doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17.</note> when yet the Scripture ſheweth plainely, that <hi>we muſt walke from faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to faith daily</hi>; and that, not onely to more aſſurance of iuſtification, but to a greater meaſure of ſanctification alſo: that our life may be a liuing by faith, according to that which the Apoſtle ſaith to the Galathians:<note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note>

               <p>And as the people of Iſraell in that one part of their life daily roſe vp per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that the wals of Iericho ſhould fall after God had foretold it them;<note place="margin">Ioſ. 6.14.</note> and for prooſe thereof did euery day compaſſe them, blowing trumpets of rammes hornes, as they had beene commanded: ſo in our longer conflict not with Iericho but with him, who is called the Prince of the world, this our faith is to lie downe with vs, and to riſe vp with vs, and through the day to accompany vs. And nothing is more to be lamented then this:<note place="margin">Though there be but little faith, yet it is not miſſed.</note> that though it be rare and ſeldome found in the earth (the Diuell holding men in vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe ſtrongly, as it were in bands) yet it is not wanted or once miſſed: and the godly themſelues (for the moſt part of them) ſcarcely haue any great vſe of it, in reſpect of that which they might haue.

               <p>If theſe three be not in our way, I ſee not much which may greatly hinder vs. For if we be reſolued to conſecrate our ſelues wholly to God while we liue; and indeuour to nouriſh and preſerue that feruencie which at our firſt calling God wrought in vs, ſo that ſuch holy ſparckles be not quenched; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> then that we haue the word of God ordinarily to blow vp and cheariſh the ſame: doubtleſſe, we are in the ſafeſt and beſt way to liue happily that in this life can be inioyed: although all haue not the like meaſure of grace and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, by meanes whereof it cannot be alike with all, though they be voide of theſe fore-mentioned lets, (as I ſhall haue occaſion to ſhew after) namely, what trouble and diſquietneſſe the Diuell raiſeth in ſome weake, yet deare ſeruants of God, by occaſion of ſome want of graces in them which others haue.</p>
               <p>But while I ſhew how the Diuell hindreth vs,<note place="margin">Sathan hath no abſolute povver. <hi>Iob. 1.12. Math. 8.30. 1. Pet. 5.8.</hi>
                  </note> I do not meane that he hath any abſolute power or authoritie of himſelfe, but as God giueth it him for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the triall of his, and the puniſhment of his enemies: but the power which he giueth him, he doth moſt cruelly, ſubtilely and malitiouſly exerciſe with all diligence, that he may deceiue euen the beſt, and ſo deſtroy them if it were poſſible. Neither let any aske how he can thus deceiue and bewitch vs? for the ground of all temptations being our owne weakneſſe, he being a ſpirit hath acceſſe vnto our ſpirits to trouble them: and through long experience knowing our nature, and practiſing our miſerie from age to age, he is able with eaſe to worke our annoyance in all reſpects.</p>
               <p>And this giueth him knowledge of our minds more fully, who vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſame by the leaſt ſhew and inclination of our affection and will; not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that he knoweth our hearts perfectly,<note place="margin">He knovveth not our hearts and thoughts.</note> (for that is proper to God onely) but by his long acquaintance with our nature from <hi>Adam</hi> to this day: this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him not onely to expect any outward ſignification of ſpeech or geſture to conceiue our intents and purpoſes by; but alſo out of our vniuerſall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (whereof he hath continuall proofe) to diſcouer the vanitie of our minds, and the thoughts of our hearts: which after he hath found, he ſetteth vs forward (as he ſeeth occaſion whereto we muſt inclne) to diſobey God and his holy commandements.</p>
               <p>But I will returne to the lets whereby the Diuell deceiueth the ſimple, that they ſhine not as lights to honour their profeſſion in a godly life.<note place="margin">Yee first ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall let in the godly from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, ariſing from VVant. They tie not themſelues to any direction. <hi>Math. 5.19. Pſal. 50.23. Phil. 1.27.</hi>
                  </note> The firſt of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the three (I ſayd) is by holding them from being ſetled in an holy courſe. As for example: he ſo handleth the matter, that many true hearted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhall not know how, or not thinke it meete, to tie themſelues to any rules or order of paſſing the day and leading their life, but walke (as it falleth out) with ſome generall care, and a good meaning at ſome time; whereas the Scripture teacheth vs to be directed particularly in our thoughts, words and deeds touching euerie commandement, that our whole conuerſation may
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:16851:228"/>
beſeeme the Goſpell. Now therefore if we paſſe the day, and looke not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> vs what we go about, that we may be caried with care for the right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of our duties; who ſeeth not, that euen this one is a ſufficient let to him who is holden vnder of it, as not being able to anſwer for many of his actions done to the offence of God and men in the day, as he might haue bene? For in that experience which I haue, I cannot ſay that this one let is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from very many, euen of thoſe which giue good hope that they would do well; and therefore it blemiſheth many of their actions.</p>
               <p>Some do propound to themſelues a courſe of paſſing their time and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their liues in ſome points commendably, (as for example: in their calling to be occupied in ſome labour) but do not religiouſly behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> therein, ſhewing patience where they ought and as they haue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nor iuſtice and innocencie, and ſo walke in the feare of God; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not find the ſweetneſſe which a godly life yeeldeth, whereas that were a right and good directing of them: but herein they rather followe the example of others in thinking they do well, then are led by any commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, or warrant of his word; and therefore they not wiſely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing how many wayes the Diuell will go about to hinder them euen in that, are ſoone broken off from that good purpoſe which they made, and are vnſetled againe: whether it be by their ignorance and folly, or pretence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions; whatſoeuer was the meane thereof, the Diuell was the worker <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> of it.</p>
               <p>They are no wiſer nor deſerue any greater commendation then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who at ſome times and for a ſeaſon keepe and obſerue ſuch order and direction to leade their liues by, as they haue learned out of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;<note place="margin">It is ſlightly done.</note> but by litle and litle they fall to do it in a ſleight and common manner, euen for faſhion in great part, and rather through cuſtome and for ſhame (and ſo waxe ſoone veary) then with delight and comfort: and all becauſe their hearts go not with their actions conſtantly, neither do they regard or looke to their conſciences in one thing as in another, that they may be kept in peace. In all which though they cannot ſo much be blamed for any great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> euill they do, yet their inconſtancie in declining ſo ſoone from their good beginnings, is no ſmall blemiſh in them, although they lie not long therein. Whereby who doth not ſee that the Diuell watcheth them narowly, that he may ſpoile them of their liberties and bring them into ſore dangers; although few of them giue themſelues to know by whom this is wrought, neither marke what letted them, or put them out of their courſe, much leſſe preuent or reſiſt them? Nay, which is more to be maruelled at, ſome are ſo groſſely deceiued by him, that they are not grieued (for the time) that they were let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but glad to haue excuſes for their breaking out. Againe, when they are diſtempered in their courſe and fallen into euill thereby, yet know they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> not how to recouer, but fall further; or be afraid to go about their recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Some, when God giueth them an inckling of his diſpleaſure, yet go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward till he ſtrike them with more maine blowes; and then they become blockiſh vnder great afflictions: as we reade of <hi>Ionas,</hi> when he fell aſleepe notwithſtanding his ſinne,<note place="margin">Ionas 1.3.</note> after he was told of the great danger which did then hang ouer him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:16851:228"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> Theſe and ſuch like, whiles they are ſecretly brought vpon the people of God, do they not (thinke we) manifeſtly proue that Sathan hath beguiled them? And whiles he bringeth them to this point, doth he not greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the beautie of a godly life in them? Do not ſome of them feare, that they are departed from God vtterly, no more to returne, though this (I ſay) ſhould not be? And they who go not ſo farre from ſound iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, are they not yet much appalled? where is their former peace and ſpirituall reioycing in God their portion? what is become of their conſtancie in watchfulneſſe, and holy care?<note place="margin">Heb. 10.35.</note> where is their ſtrong confidence which they ſhould not caſt away? their feruent prayers, their fruitfulneſſe in ſundry duties when they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> feele themſelues neither fit to be in company, nor to be occupied in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor without danger to be alone by themſelues? I thinke theſe are the fruits of lamentable wants in ſuch good things as ſometime they inioyed: and not bare wants; for ſuch ſhall the beſt of vs haue whiles we liue, and yet not be without peace, nor vnſetled: but theſe which I haue ſpoken of, both vnſetle and diſtemper them whom the Diuell oppreſſeth with them. So that it may truly be ſayd, that this is one ſpeciall kind of lets whereby he hindreth the going forward of Gods people, euen in holding them from conſtancie and ſtedfaſtneſſe in liuing godly from day to day, and from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing their couenant with God from time to time: without which grace it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> not poſſible for them to be free from ſore blemiſhes, and inward vexation, and outward reproach thereby, which the beloued of the Lord ſhould be farre from. And although through Gods tender kindneſſe, (whereby he keepeth them that they be not vtterly forſaken, and will keepe them to the end) although (I ſay) through this goodneſſe of God, all theſe turne to their good; yet that is not long of them or of their ſecuritie and ſleight ſeruing of God, the Diuell intending no other thing thereby but the diſhonor of God and their ouerthrow. If any ſhall ſay, There are none but go aſide theſe waies: I anſwer, It is therefore the more neceſſarie that we ſhould be warned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and fenced againſt them. And by this it may appeare, what a maine let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and hindrance this is to Gods people from a Chriſtian life: to be deſtitute of direction how to pleaſe God, and thereby to be vnſetled and wander in their courſe of liuing, as though there were no certaine way appointed them of God.</p>
               <p>The remedie to all theſe is appointed by God,<note place="margin">The remedie</note> and brought to light by his word, and inioyed and practiſed of ſundrie of his faithfull ſeruants, who were ſometime kept voide of it by the enuious man, as euen many thouſands of them are ſtill by his malice depriued thereof vnto this day. And this remedy is, firſt that we ſuffer our ſelues eaſily to be perſwaded that all our ſpeeches in the commendation of a godly life in generall, are but wind, except we faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> indeuour to bring it into practiſe euerie day;<note place="margin">Is, to be daily well ſetled.</note> and therefore prouide (as we may be taught) and that aboue all other things, to giue to euerie part of the day ſome duty; or when we be weakeſt, that we mind no euill, (as in the former Treatiſe of my booke I haue proued) ſeeing the Lord in appointing the day to the ſeuerall actions which are to be done in it, doth not paſſe by and omit theſe (wherein men thinke they haue greateſt libertie to forget God) namely, eating and drinking; but yet with them extendeth his charge

If we find this impoſſible in all points, ſhall we therefore yeeld and giue place, and ſeeke ſhelter for our vntoward hearts, which would do no more in the ſeruice of God, then we haue done in times paſt? or ſhall we ayme vnto no further perfection then we liſt? And if there be hardneſſe in practiſing ſome part of chriſtian duties at the beginning, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> let there be no reſiſtance againſt it, but our wants acknowledged, that we may ſee the greater cauſe to grow forward: yea, and know we, that the worke that we haue euery day to do,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>For ſuch as cannot better direct themſelues, I haue indeuoured to be ſome helpe vnto them in the former treatiſe,<note place="margin">By the doctrine of the former Treatiſe.</note> vntill a perfecter may be come by. This or any other which thou approueſt in thy conſcience, vſe reuerently and acquaint thy ſelfe with it, and thou ſhalt find it ſweet and gainefull: leaue not off the practiſing of the rules of it, or the like, by litle and litle; for then ſhalt thou neuer gather any ſound experience of the good that is gotten ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> but as thou mayeſt, obſerue it better and better, and ſo become more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in it: ſo doing although thou ſhouldeſt ſometime be turned out of the way, yet thou ſhalt by one part or other of it, learne how to returne againe. <hi>For doth a man go out of the way,</hi>

               <p>This confidence being preſerued, and heartie prayer oft vſed, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> againſt thine eſpeciall infirmities, with oft and due conſidering what a precious treaſure this courſe of life is, ſhall preſerue thee againſt this wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring courſe which Sathan intendeth to bring thee into; by which thou ſhalt be vnſetled in the ſeruing of God, the leaſt euill whereof, is vnquietnes of mind, or idleneſſe and vnſetledneſſe, if not hardneſſe of heart.

               <p>And that do they proue vnto vs, who although they are not altogether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> voide of them, yet they thinke it too much to make them daily armour vnto them; alleadging for themſelues, that this is euen to deny to Chriſtians the libertie which God hath giuen them. And therefore at this ſtay they keepe, and will not be drawne from it, till God bewray to them more clearely the diuels ſubtiltie in holding them there, and what they haue loſt by the hote maintaining of their vaine liberties; that which they loſe for them, being far

               <p>If therefore through our neglect of theſe we be otherwiſe fallen into Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans hands then we were wont, there is no other remedie but that we beare our puniſhment for a ſeaſon, euen heauineſſe and reproch, becauſe we haue ſinned: but although we haue thus fallen, yet let vs riſe againe,<note place="margin">Micah. 7.8.

               <p>I ſtand the longer in this point, becauſe I haue experience by many, how hardly they dare or can be perſwaded to craue pardon with confidence, after that they haue bene caried by their rebellious hearts to offend in ſomewhat,<note place="margin">Pſal. 32.5.</note> which they knew to diſpleaſe him.

(But otherwiſe, where there is boldneſſe in ſinning, there is no ſtrength in beleeuing.) Thankes be vnto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> God for his vnſpeakeable mercie, that many of theſe times fall not out to his deare ſeruants, who are reſolutely prepared to ſtand vpon their watch; for it is an heauie worke when that betideth vs: and they who ſee not this, ſee litle in the myſterie of godlineſſe. And as I would haue my good brethren farre from lying ſtill, and abiding in vnbeliefe at ſuch a time when they haue caſt themſelues into it by their owne default; ſo yet to let all bold preſumers vpon God, and abuſers of his mercie vnderſtand, that Gods bountifulneſſe is not ſet foorth in the Scriptures, to adde drunkenneſſe to thirſt in men,<note place="margin">Deut 29.19.</note> and to giue them libertie to ſinne who are alreadie too forward that way; this I ſay: That as the people of Iſrael perceiuing God to be iuſtly diſpleaſed with them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for their treſpaſſe of the calfe, and therefore remouing the tabernacle where his preſence was, a farre off from them and their tents,<note place="margin">Exo. 33.8.10.</note> they durſt not preſume to go to the tabernacle to ſeeke the Lord, who in diſpleaſure was departing from them; but they ſought him a farre off, that is, ſtanding in their tent doore and worſhipping: ſo let thoſe who ſee their ſhame and nakedneſſe by ſinning againſt God, bluſh and be aſhamed; yet, becauſe he neuer taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his louing kindneſſe from thoſe whom he loueth, let them ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

               <p>Now then, to come to our purpoſe, when this loue ſhall waxe cold (as here our Sauiour chargeth many with it, and many now a dayes are iuſtly to be charged for it) is it not an intollerable trecherie? When we ſhal let ſlake in vs the conſideration of ſuch loue of God to vs in Chriſt, which neuer faileth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.1.</note> nor chaungeth towards vs; and we thought ſometime, that it could neuer be forgotten of vs: is not this ſlaking of our loue towards him, a iuſt cauſe of complaint againſt vs? And do we not declare thereby, that either we be growne dull, ſlouthfull: forgetfull, or that we thinke, that the Lord hath ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be mercifull? Is it not a plaine teſtifying, that we thinke we are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded and prouided for by him, ſo as we may continue all wonted duties and ſeruices towards him? Yea rather, are we not iuſtly to be charged that we are couenant-breakers,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 1.</note> or haue (as adultereſſes) broken our faith to our firſt husband?</p>
               <p>Whereas we hauing ſo long enioyed the priuiledges of his people and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, ſhould now much more do ſo, and looke confidently for the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reward, <hi>our ſaluation being now nearer then when we firſt beleeued.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.13.</note> For why ſhould pleaſure or profite, wealth or fauour, things preſent or to come, put out of place that loue of God in vs, or cauſe vs for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be rebuked?

               <p>For in many it may be ſeene, of whom it may as truly be ſaid, that they are nothing like the people which once they were, when they firſt embraced the Goſpell.<note place="margin">Giuing iuſt cauſe to others to lament their caſe.</note> I might iuſtly make the complaint of any which haue bene but aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their zeale and feruent loue of good things, (of which ſort there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable:) but I would I might not alſo charge numbers that they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, being ſo farre off from forward and zealous profeſſors (which once they were) that (as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> complaineth of the Corinthians) <hi>they are now full</hi> ; yea, they thinke it meere fooliſhneſſe to hunger after knowledge,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>For it is to be lamented, to ſee how few can rightly vſe ſuch liberties and make their profite of them while they inioy them: as to draw out of their teachers, vnderſtanding, and humbly pray and labour for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wiſedome whereby they may haue the right vſe of their knowledge in euerie particular action: and in the ſpirit of meekneſſe to helpe build vp one another, and to be lights to the ignorant by giuing good example; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> but worldly minded, or contentious, or paſſing their time vainely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely.

Finally, the want of our whole armour, or any part of it,<note place="margin">The vvant of daily keeping on the armor, is a great want.</note> whereby we defend <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our ſelues from euill on euerie ſide, this (though all the other were preſent) ſhould ſenſibly appeare to be wanting, for the daungers and fals which we ſhold ſuſtaine for want of the ſame. The remedy againſt the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the word preached, is to relieue our ſelues with it, where we may with moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy inioy it: but rather that we ſue eaneſtly to liue vnder it: which would be more generally granted of God, if it were (as a benefit which cannot be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſought for &amp; deſired.

               <p>The remedy of all the other wants, ſeeing it is a faithfull practiſing of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> daily direction, of the which I haue ſpoken largely alreadie, or any other ſuch: therfore it is ſufficient to ſhew the Reader; that all theſe wants the Diuell will hinder him by, to the end that he may hold him back from the practiſe of the godly life,<note place="margin">Prou 23.23.</note> and conſequently from the ſweete fruite which he might inioy thereby. The which I ſpeake to this end, that he may be on the other ſide more incouraged reſolutely to giue ouer himſelfe thereunto daily: ſeeing thereby all theſe euils and perils of this life ſo vnwelcome and ſo much fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, may be in great part auoided.</p>

of the firſt kind of lets, whereby the Diuell hindreth vs through wants in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> good things; he taking occaſion from the corruption of our nature, whereby we are prone to euill and vnapt to good, to ſtrengthen ſinne in vs.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Many vveake ones troubled with feare of their owne vvants, vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe.</note>Now I haue ſhewed how the Diuell troubleth many weake Chriſtians by the wants before mentioned, here I thinke not amiſſe, to ſhew how ſome are troubled by feare of their owne wants without cauſe.

And among the manifold hurts which he bringeth by meanes thereof to many weake Chriſtians, this one is not to be omitted: what grieuous and ſore diſcouragements he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth many tender conſciences with, while they eſpie ſome gfts of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> in other, which they thinke be not in themſelues; though they ſeeke aboue all things to pleaſe God, as hauing had ſome ſweet feeling of his fauour through faith.

               <p>In which ſtate he driueth them to find out in themſelues many diſorders and fals, ſundrie out-ſtrayings from their Chriſtian courſe, and how they cannot preuaile ouer their corruptions; and ſo maketh the innocent ſoules, not onely to thinke that they be farre worſe then they are, but alſo troubleth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and diſquieteth them beyond meaſure: inſomuch that they haue bitter ſobs, and make ſore complaints againſt themſelues; in the meane while forgetting (through vnthankfulneſſe) Gods manifold kindneſſes towards them, and what cauſe of reioycing rather, and thankſgiuing they haue offered vnto them.<note place="margin">Some are long troubled in this manner.</note> And in this caſe he keepeth ſome of them many yeares together, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading themſelues that none are ſo bad as they, nor ſuch hypocrites, &amp;c. when yet the things whereof they do moſt accuſe themſelues, are meere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and not any groſſe or palpable treſpaſſes. This deſcription of them (that I ſay no more of them) who ſeeth not how apparently it bewraieth the Diuels malice and ſubtiltie in hindring, yea ſnaring them (as I may ſay) in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſuch ſort, as they cannot wind out any way? when yet (as hath bene ſayd) there are no ſincerer-hearted Chriſtians then they, nor who ſeeke the Lord more hartily, for that meaſure of knowledge &amp; experience which they haue.</p>

and haue gotten ſome ſtrength in a good Chriſtian (though that be neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> without his owne great fault) how doth it trouble and diſquiet him, yea wound and accuſe him, he thinking it the loathſomeſt and moſt ſhamefull of all others (as indeed there need no worſe thing to annoy and diſturbe him;) and it cauſeth him oft to ſay: Oh, what can be more irkeſome, vnſauorie and ſhameful then this?<note place="margin">1. Sam. 12.19.20.</note> Euen as the people ſaid in <hi>Samuel</hi> of their wilfulneſſe: <hi>We haue ſinned many other waies, but eſpecially in asking a King:</hi> ſo I ſay, that ſin ſeemeth to a penitent chriſtian (when he commeth to himſelfe) moſt odious, wherewith he hath felt his heart moſt intangled. But to proue that true which I ſayd; ſo doth he cry out of the reſt, when he remembreth how he hath beene deceiued by them: a worldly and greedy mind ſeemeth moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> weariſome and vnbeſeeming of all other to him, and biteth moſt deeply, when that hath poſſeſſed him: and when he hath offended by anger, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, feare, impatience, peeuiſh conceitedneſſe and the reſt, he ſaith the ſame of them; euerie one for the time wherein it hath bene the chiefeſt prouoker of him to offend, is moſt cried out of, euen as if there were no other to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with it: thus he ſpeaketh of them, I ſay, when he repenteth. And by this it may appeare, (when there are many of theſe euery while aſſaulting and, as it were, arreſting a poore Chriſtian; which ſuffer no other good thing to be in place where they be) that if he be not ſtrengthened &amp; armed againſt theſe and ſuch other of that kind, he can neuer keepe a ſetled courſe and daily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> continue the ſame in a godly life. Of theſe therefore, as I ſayd, I will mention ſome, that the beleeuing Chriſtian may the more carefully auoide them. And herein this aduice is not vnprofitable, that euery one marke, with which he is moſt incombred and moſt eaſily ouercome of: as feare, anger, vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe, &amp;c. and by what occaſions he is readilieſt drawne to them: that he may the more preuaile ouer them by ſuch helpe as he ſhall haue miniſtred to him. The remedies ſo farre as I ſhall adde here, ſhall either be ſet downe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally with the ſeuerall lets, or one remedie for ſundry lets: or where neither is, know that the daily direction which we haue beene moued to practiſe, ſhall be the remedie in ſuch a caſe. And among the vnmortified affections I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> will begin with that which troubleth the moſt of them,<note place="margin">The first kind of them, is feare and doubt of perſeuering, by meanes of afflictions, &amp;c.</note> till God giue them releaſe or deliuerance: and that is, A fearfull doubting of their perſeuerance. I meane, that poore Chriſtians ſhall not ſo ſoone begin to be drawne out of the world, to any liuely hope of ſaluation and care of pleaſing God, and ſo haue eſcaped one bondage, but he plungeth them into another; holding them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dreadfull feare and diſtruſtfulneſſe, that they ſhall not perſeuer to the end of a godly life, eſpecially in ſore trials, and when perſecution and ſtrong temptations ſhall come.</p>

                  <note place="margin">It eaſily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hold of vveake ones.</note>And this feare he doth faſten vpon them the more eaſily, ſeeing that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of feare is moſt nearly glewed to them: and beſides, when they ſee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of faintings in many profeſſors; and how cruel the vngodly, prophane ſcorners, Atheiſts, Papiſts and perſecuters are, among whom they liue, this feare is ſoone ſtrengthened and confirmed in them. For which cauſe our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour forewarned his Diſciples of it,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> ſaying: <hi>Feare not them which kill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but are not able to kill the ſoule: but rather feare him, which is able to deſtroy both ſoule and body in hell</hi>:<note place="margin">Phil. 1.28.</note> and Saint <hi>Paule: In nothing feare your aduerſaries, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> For this cannot be predominant but it feebleth vtterly the powers of the mind, (as the raiſing of the mudde in a ſpring,<note place="margin">Hovv it letteth them.</note> troubleth the pure water) and conſequently holdeth backe the inſtruments of the body from practiſing well any kind of dutie. In theſe fetters therefore of feare, and moſt painefull and irkeſome ſtreights, he holdeth them: or if any eſcape, and ſo begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in their hope againe; yet ſhall they not attaine thereto, nor grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (diſtruſting themſelues, and reſting in the promiſe of God) nor be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of their feare but with much difficultie and ſtriuing: and yet if they be, it ſhall not be at once, but by litle and litle; while the word of God ſoketh into their hearts, as the ſoft raigne into the hard ground.

               <p>And this is ſo true, that euen the beſt after they haue renewed their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with the Lord to be more fruitfull and conſtant, &amp; alſo do purpoſe the ſame with full reſolution: yet by litle and litle, they ſhall feele that feruencie of theirs weakened and cooled, and ſenſibly declining, euen as the Sunne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his going downe. For which cauſe, the Apoſtle doth oftentimes ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fence the Chriſtians againſt it: ſaying, Be not wearie of well doing.<note place="margin">Gal. 6.9. 1. Cor. 16.13.</note> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: Stand faſt in the faith: quite you like men, be ſtrong. And thus if we curbe not in the vnruly affections and luſts, which would ſoone faſten vpon vs, and do not oft record our many ſweet liberties which we find in ſeruing God, (which ſhall alſo be greateſt, when we haue continued longeſt:) we ſhall find this too true by our owne experience, namely, what wearines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> groweth vpon vs now and then eſpecially, of holding on chearefully and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in our Chriſtian courſe.</p>
               <p>For as the diſeaſes in the nether parts of the bodie do make the heart hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and the head to be diſtempered, and they being healed do eaſe and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both: euen ſo, theſe vnmortified affections of ours being out of order, do trouble the ſoule and diſquiet it; &amp; therfore the well ordering of them, is a ſingular chearing and comforting of the ſoule and mind.

But becauſe the matter ariſeth more large then I looked for, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſtudie with all breuitie to ſet downe the diuerſe kinds of vntamed affections, barely with their remedies) I will therefore ſhut vp this ſecond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſort of lets with naming the particulars onely, which are not alreadie mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: that the reader may know, and ſo be able to diſcerne them, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of them as of the reſt.</p>
               <p>So he ſometime prouoketh vs to vniuſt anger, (which is no better then a ſhort madneſſe) eſpecially when we can ſay,<note place="margin">The laſt of this kind of ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections here mentioned, conſisting of many.</note> we had cauſe offered vs: ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he turne our affections againſt vs, which God teacheth vs to vſe to good ends and purpoſes. At ſome other time, he poiſoneth vs with deadly conceipts and heartburnings againſt ſuch as we diſlike; alſo with looſeneſſe and lightneſſe of heart; alſo with raſhneſſe and haſtines, wherein we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well; with lumpiſhnes and melancholie, and with diuerſe ſuch like:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the beginnings and firſt riſinges of the which, although our owne hearts do breed, yet the ſtrength of them is of Sathan. By all which, as he ſeeth his beſt opportunitie, he ſo poſſeſſeth our hearts, that they are no more fit (in that ſort, being vnſetled) to be employed in any part of Gods ſeruice; then the running water when it is ſtirred and troubled in the bottome, is for our neceſſarie vſe. And thus it may appeare, how many of Gods deare ſeruants are holden backe by occaſions of their owne corruptions (the diuell adding ſtrength thereto) from ſhining as lights in a chriſtian courſe: and when God hath mercifully begun in them the life of godlineſſe, how they do afterwards (though it be litle to their commendation or reioycing) breake off or hinder <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> their growing forward in the ſame, through ſome great fault of their owne; not ſubduing their rebellious hearts, as God teacheth them, neither ſtirring vp and cheriſhing the good gifts of God which were giuen them before, as they might with eaſe haue done, being taught and ſhewed how: eſpecially, their fault is this, that they haue giuen themſelues to many fond and vaine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, both in ſpeaking, thinking and liuing; which to be pulled from, it

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> would ſeeme to them (when they ſhould but euen heare of it) to be as the cutting off a peece of their fleſh. I ſpeake not now of the vnreformed, for their vſuall courſe is ordinarily thus, neither are they in any order before men except they haue their owne mind ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>For the remedying of theſe and ſuch like, this is no ſmall helpe, that they ſet themſelues to marke their diſpoſition and inclination better, to what ſinne they are moſt prone: and beſides, except they haue a wiſe care to keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues beſeeming the Goſpell, eſpecially in thoſe parts of their liues which lye open to greateſt daungers, that therein they be beſt furniſhed: and if they take a foile and ſuſtaine a checke to their conſcience, yet to ſeeke the curing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and eaſe of it by due humiliation ſpeedily. But this will not much preuaile, except their owne hearts haue bene brought to take ſound delight in the chriſtian courſe, and waine themſelues from that which they ſhall know to be againſt it, and to be glad to be aduiſed and directed how to recouer. But of this ſecond kind of lets thus much.</p>

               <p>I meane by theſe, all ſorts of worldly luſts, which are more noyſome and daungerous then the euill affections mentioned before: though (one would think) we had litle need to be ſhaken and diſtempered with greater then they, but rather ſtudie how to make them weakened and ſubdued in vs. Theſe worldly luſts, are luſts of the fleſh which belong to the preſent ſtate of this life and world: as the exceeding loue and deſire of pleaſures, riches and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> or honor, &amp;c. For if he can faſten our delights on theſe, we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried headlong, as the chariot by wild horſes is ouerturned. I will ſhew the daunger we are in by meanes of theſe worldly luſts in two kinds: The luſtes of the fleſh, properly ſo called; and the inordinate deſire of riches and cares of the world. How a true Chriſtian may poſſibly be diſguiſed by theſe, (I ſay) that he ſhall be thereby as another man, and ſometime groſſely ouercome of them, I will firſt ſhew, and then adde ſome remedies againſt them.

This thorne where it groweth, it ſuffereth no good thing to grow by it, but choaketh it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſhadoweth any other gifts of God whatſoeuer.

For he who doth not yet ſee the deceiptful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of richs, how they blindfold the heart that it cannot ſee clearely the beautie of chriſtianity; alas, how is he led about of his fantaſies (like a foole) to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> dreame of the happineſſe of his outward eſtate? Oh, what pleaſure is it to him to thinke of that which he hath? How is his heart made drunken with the fleſhly reioycing in his wealth and welfare? How doth it delight him to think what libertie he hath in the world by reaſon of his abilitie, to pleaſe himſelfe in that which his heart carieth him to, or his eye luſteth after? when yet he is ſo much the more miſerable, becauſe he hath nothing to reſtraine him from ſuch libertie. How doth he caſt in his head what he will do hereafter, and within ſome few yeares how conueniently he will haue all things about him, (I ſpeake ſtill of a Chriſtian: for euen ſo may ſuch an one be beguiled for a ſeaſon;<note place="margin">Luk. 12.20.</note>) and before the time be expired he is taken away from all, like the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> foole in the Goſpell, and laid in the earth?</p>

               <head>CHAP. 11. Of the remedies againſt this worldly luſt: namely, Couetouſneſſe and exceſsiue loue of riches.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt to ſet downe ſomewhat more clearly and diſtinctly for helpe and redreſſe of this ſinne of couetouſneſſe and worldly luſt, becauſe I haue ſomewhat largely ſpoken of the ſame: I could wiſh that the remedies and reaſons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to redreſſe theſe many and dangerous ſinnes, (and to preuent the ſame,<note place="margin">The ſecond point about this matter, hovv to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſse it.</note> where they haue not as yet broke out in many of Gods people) that the remedies (I ſay) and reaſons againſt them were well marked, and alſo the direction how to vſe them both, (as followeth) duly regarded. And to begin with the remedies which I will here ſet downe, they are foure, euen as the reaſons alſo are. Firſt, he that deſireth to be free from great blame and offence by the vſe of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods, and conſequently to hold faſt his peace with God thereby, (as I know not what morall action is more to be deſired) let him looke to this as he would to the auoiding of the collicke or ſtone:<note place="margin">The firſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</note> That no man be hurt or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſuſtaine loſſe and danger by him; but let him throughly be perſwaded of it indeed, that he ought to do thus: as we are ſtraightly charged by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle:<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>See that no man oppreſſe or defraud his brother in any matter.</hi> So that, as we will be ſure that none ſhall wrong vs, ſo farre as we be able to reſiſt it, (and therefore we need not be bidden to regard our ſelues:) ſo becauſe few of vs will be carefull to ſee others with whom we deale, to inioy their right, but will be ready rather to plucke from them; therefore is this charge giuen vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others (not a litle foiling to this ſinne of worldlines, if it be regarded.)</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The benefit of this remedy.</note>For then we ſhall be free from all the ſinnes againſt our neighbour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the eighth commandement (as far as we can diſcerne them) both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in bargaining, (which are not a few) and alſo in other dealings with men, (which are almoſt innumbrable:) neither ſhall we deſire it in our harts, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure them, ſeeing the law that bindeth vs is ſpiritual. And what a treaſure were it, ſo to mind this charge in all our dealings with men through the day, that we might haue the bleſſed and ſweet fruite of it at night, when we are to lie down? Oh, what liberty may ſuch haue, as look faithfully to this? (In like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, do not ſorowes inough abide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who reſtraine not their harts from ſuch iniurying of men with full reſolution?) Again, he who will be ſubiect to this charge of the Apoſtle, and couenant holily, to vſe this firſt remedie through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his life, namely, that none ſhall ſuſtaine wrong or hurt by him; ſhall be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> free from many branches of couetouſneſſe: yea, he that is armed to do no euill this way, or if he haue, doth correct and redreſſe it, ſhall ſhew himſelfe to be a man that hath ſtrugled commendably with the world and earthly goods, and alſo to haue gotten great victory thereby. And therefore are there few ſuch; becauſe few do tie themſelues to ſuch couenants. Which kind of men, if they could be free from blame in many other things, yet

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſhould they ſufficiently be branded for worldly and couetous, if they be found vnarmed againſt this.</p>
               <p>The ſecond remedie is: not onely that we hurt them not,<note place="margin">The ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie: To do good to all.</note> but alſo that we do them good. Which is to be vnderſtood of all with whom we haue to do. Euen as that Scripture teacheth, confirming this rule: namely, That we ſhould owe nothing to any, but this, That we loue them.<note place="margin">

For breuity ſake to our Chriſtian Prince we owe tribute and other duty by our goods,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.7.</note> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we ſee it to be required of vs both in peace and warre. About which I ſay no more but this, that as all drawing backe and vnwillingneſſe to performe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties neceſſarily impoſed, is euill: ſo this is not a ſmall blemiſh, when ſuch as go for good Chriſtians, do commonly contend and raiſe ſtrife about their payments, and do not rather proportionably diſcharge the ſame with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe. The next is,<note place="margin">

Gal. 6.6.</note> to the vpholding and maintaining of the Miniſterie and the Goſpell preached: which due, they who being able, are not ready to diſcharge, but draw their neckes out of the coller: beſides that, they ſhew they are neither friends nor fauourers of that holy ordinance of God; ſo they proue, and that too truly, that they reape ſmall benefite by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> preaching of the glad tidings of it.<note place="margin">The poore mans duty in this caſe.</note> So that euen the poore who are able to giue nothing, are in no better caſe, if they be not in affection and good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the beſt and forwardeſt, in token, that if they had abilitie, they would not be behind others in that duty.</p>

And this briefly be ſayd of the ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie againſt a worldly and couetous heart: which being layd with the firſt, ſhall not be found a ſmall meane to diſfigure and maime ſuch a ſinne: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when they ſhall both go with the other two which follow.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.

And this they may do, as well in thoſe that haue them, as they may in them who ſeeke, and cannot come by them. In thoſe who haue and inioy them, the danger is to be feared, which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of: that they be not to vs as they be to the moſt, our ſtrong holds. The <hi>riches of a man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 18.11.</note> ſaith he, <hi>are his ſtrong holds:</hi> and make him, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>to be high minded.</hi> For thus he writeth to <hi>Timothy: Charge them who are rich in this world,</hi>

                  <hi>that they be not high minded.</hi> For if they puffe vp our minds, and make vs ſwell, they will draw vs on to any ſinne: as licentiouſneſſe, idleneſſe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and boldneſſe in euill, whiles we thinke we haue that which will beare vs out, and hold vs vp againſt any which might riſe againſt vs; vntill the fruits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of them breake forth in vs more bitter then gall or wormewood. Againe, they will make vs worldly, prophane, nigardly, diſcontented: for he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſiluer, ſhall not be ſatisfied with it: and he that loueth riches, ſhall be without the fruite of them, Eccleſ. 5.9. Alſo they will fill vs with ſlauiſh feare of loſing and forgoing them: and what will inſue of this bondage, but a weariſome and tedious troubleſomneſſe? that they will not ſuffer vs to reſt; but (as the flies of Aegypt, which with no beating off, did ceaſe to diſquiet the people) with care and penſiueneſſe will torment vs waking, and with fearfull dreames ſting and wound vs ſleeping, yea breake off our ſleepe alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when we ſhould take and inioy it: till, as a moth, which taketh away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the beauty of a garment, they conſume and eate vp all the ſpirituall grace that was in vs?</p>
               <p>This is ſome part of the hurt that riches may do vs, euen as they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and bring all theſe with many other to the men of the world; as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>Salomons</hi> words:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.12.</note>

All which,<note place="margin">Hovv to auoid them.</note> true Chriſtians muſt learne to reſiſt and withſtand, and to ſee what allowance God affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them, and not what their greedy appetite would deſire.

For firſt, they haue more time and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then theſe, to all exerciſes of religion and the worſhip of God, both publicke and priuate: I meane, they may ofter inioy the preaching of the word, haue recourſe to reading, Chriſtian conference in good company, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> meditation alſo and prayer: (which, how great helpes they be to the keeping of a ſetled courſe in godlines, hath bin before ſet downe:) whereas the poore, beſides that they ſhall looke to themſelues commendably, if they be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and made impatient by their wants; ſo they cannot for the moſt part, take the benefit of the afore-mentioned helpes in any ſuch ſort as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may.</p>

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:16851:245"/>
as men go to worke in the world who haue receiued great riches at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Gods hand, it is hard to proue, that they be moſt fruitfull: but let ſuch know that their account ſhall be the greater. Therefore, the obiection being thus anſwered, it remaineth cleare and without controuerſie, that men who haue receiued greater outward benefits of God then others, may and ought to be the better for them to God-ward (as from whom iuſt cauſe of care and thought taking is remoued) then the poorer ſort, who lie open to them both.</p>
               <p>This good therefore we muſt ſee that we do to our ſelues, who haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of him the commodities which many of his deare ſeruants do want,<note place="margin">As vve proſper outwardly, ſo ſee that our ſoules thriue.</note> that we hold the profeſſion of our hope with ioy from day to day, that we may ſay it truly, that our ſoules are much more well liking by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> or neceſſaries of this life which we haue: or elſe, we ſhall neuer be able to free our ſelues from the blemiſh of worldlineſſe.

               <p>But to go further: our riches ſhould do vs other good, beſide that which I haue ſpoke of.<note place="margin">VVhat further good our riches may do vs. <hi>Luke 16.9.</hi>

For thus, we giuing them to the poore, do lend them vnto the Lord, and do (as it were) put them in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> hands: and ſo whatſoeuer we lay out, ſhall plentifully be payed vs againe, <hi>euen an hundreth fold,</hi>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues drudges for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> And it will one day be wiſhed, that we had thus done good to our ſelues by them, rather then to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſeruants, yea ſlaues to our children in prouiding greedily for them, (for it ſo falleth out with the moſt) while we dare ſcarcely take any part of our goods to honeſt and neceſſarie vſes, leſt we ſhould thereby plucke from them: therein verifying the ſaying of the wiſe:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.15.</note> 
                  <hi>This is an euill ſickneſſe, that in all points as we came, ſo ſhall we go: and what profit haue we, that we haue trauelled for the wind,</hi> that is, in vaine and for nothing? Oh the good that many might do with their goods (I ſay not, to others, but euen to themſelues) if they were carefull to beſtow well but ſome part of that which they haue!</p>
               <p>But this is no place to bewaile ſuch caſes: neither haue men almoſt any eares to heare, or hearts to lament ſuch neglects of duty. To conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> this laſt remedie againſt couetouſneſſe and worldlineſſe, the monſter of many heads: euen this good, which I haue ſayd, we might do to our ſelues with our riches (euery one in his ſeuerall eſtate, who is able to giue and hath no need to receiue:<note place="margin">The fruite of all theſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note>) which if we did carefully looke to, who ſeeth not, how it would chaſe away the groſſeneſſe and daunger of this foule ſinne? And therfore much more if all theſe remedies be vſed: (1) that we do no man hurt:
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:16851:245"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>(2) but good, as occaſion ſhall be offered: (3) nor hurt our ſelues by them, but benefit our ſoules; we may be bold to aſſure our ſelues that we ſhall diſgrace couetouſneſſe in vs, one of the greateſt miſchiefes that the Diuell can worke vs. For if we did take heed, that no man in any dealings might charge vs iuſtly with vnmercifulneſſe or iniuſtice; nor our owne conſciences: if our hand and our heart did go where we are bound to releeue and diſcharge du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:<note place="margin">Note.</note> and if we did wiſely ſhunne the ſinnes which by riches we are prouoked vnto (as needleſſe ſpending, and nigardly ſparing, and their affinities) and take benefite to our ſoules, and by more religiouſneſſe looke after the life to come; we ſhould bind this ſinne in bands and chaines, which will otherwiſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> breake our hearts with griefe, and drowne both ſoules and bodies in vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>And the poore (whom in this argument I haue litle mentioned:<note place="margin">Direction for the poore.</note> who are not therefore free from couetouſneſſe, though they haue no great ſtore of riches) ſhall beſt teſtifie, that they be not (as the moſt of their condition) tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this ſin, if they hold faſt innocency, contentation, yea thankſgiuing: that is, if they hurt not others by ill ſeeking goods; but be content with their eſtate, though it be meane, and thankefull to God for it, ſeeing they deſerue not euen the pooreſt eſtate. For of both, this may be ſayd: <hi>If their conuerſation be in heauen,</hi> that is, gouerned by heauenly rules, then may they well go <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> through their dealings on the earth. And ſeeing <hi>the ſnare is in vaine ſet for that which hath wings</hi>: therefore, they flying and mounting with the wings of watching, meditation and prayer, ouer the ſnares which are layd for them, ſhall ſafely auoid the deceipts of him who ſeeketh to intrap them. And this be ſayd of the remedies againſt worldlineſſe and couetouſneſſe: the reaſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low briefly, which ſhould diſſwade vs from the ſame.</p>
               <p>The firſt is: ſeeing we cannot inioy them long,<note place="margin">The firſt reaſon. VVe cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy our wealth long. <hi>Luke 16.2.</hi>
                  </note> but either they ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from vs, or we from them: and yet this ſhort time is alſo vncertaine, as in the parable of the ſteward is declared, to whom it was ſayd (euen as it were vnlooked for:) <hi>Come, giue an account of thy ſtewardſhip, for thou mayeſt be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> no longer ſteward.</hi> This is the ſlipperie eſtate of all things here below: as by Scripture is proued, <hi>all to be vanity</hi>;<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.1.</note> and by experience which teacheth what alterations and changes there are euery where, both by death and otherwiſe: which while it is layd to heart, and ſeriouſly thought on, doth much quaile the pride of life in vs: and therefore alſo will weane vs from the loue of the world, and to the contempt of it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is: ſeeing the riches of this world are not our owne,<note place="margin">Riches are not our ovvne, but borrovved. <hi>Luke 16.12.</hi>
                  </note> but borrowed, as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith: <hi>If ye haue not bene faithfull in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans goods, who will giue you that which is yours</hi>: where he likeneth them to things that a man borrowes of his neighbour. Now we ſee, that no man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> maketh reckoning of that which is another bodies, as his goods &amp; ſubſtance: if he valew his eſtate, he counteth himſelfe neuer the richer for that which he oweth, and is euer about to pay it backe: and the honeſter man will be the more carefull to reſtore it: but to flouriſh and beare it out with another mans goods, and occupie with them when they are required and called for, it is neither the part of a wiſe man, nor of one which loueth quietneſſe and peace. Now then, for vs to buſie our ſelues endleſſely and griply about
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:16851:246"/>
wealth, as though it were our proper heritage, when the owner is euery day <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> calling for it,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.6.</note> what madneſſe is it to be counted? And yet if it were our owne, it were the ſmaller riches; <hi>godlineſſe is the great</hi>: and though we are occupied about many things, yet that one is neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.4.</note>And if he that goeth to warre, <hi>doth not intangle himſelfe with the affaires of this life</hi>: ought not we much more to be free from ſnaring of our ſelues with the goods of this world, when neither they are our owne, and when we are called to another maner of battell, where they are ſure to get no victory who are intangled in the world? But theſe words [mine and thine] are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in our mouths, that we giue manifeſt proofe thereby, that although we know that our goods be borowed, yet we do not greatly remember or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> thinke vpon it; and that we are tied with ſuch loue and liking to them, that we price them farre aboue thoſe which are our owne proper goods indeed, I meane,<note place="margin">Knowledge and grace, our proper goods.</note> knowledge and grace. But let this be inough to the wiſe, that for this very cauſe they ſhould loue them litle: becauſe they be but borrowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>3</hi> If vve be not faithfull in the ſmaller, much leſſe are we in the greater.</note>The third reaſon, which ought to perſwade vs to vſe the world ſoberly, that ſo we may not be tainted with worldlineſſe, is this: For that if we be not faithfull in this, (which is but litle in reſpect of the great and pretious treaſures of ſaluation and happineſſe) we will not, neither ſhall be faithfull in them, but ſhall ſhew our ſelues not too meane as we beare the world in hand when we profeſſe, that we ſeeke eternall life by the Goſpell preached: but ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> proue that all our prayers, confeſſions of our ſinnes, and hearings are in vaine, and that we ſhall be neuer the better for them. And what a point of madneſſe were that?<note place="margin">Luke 16.10.</note> And yet our Sauiour affirmeth it to be ſo, ſaying: <hi>He that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the leaſt, he is alſo faithfull in much: and he that is vniust in the leaſt, is vniuſt alſo in much.</hi> And who doth not ſee it to be ſo? For he that will wound and trouble his conſcience for a litle commoditie, will he not much eaſilier do it for a greater? and he that will ieopard his ſaluation for a penny, will he not much more do it for a pound? and he that will hazard it for a pound, will he not do as much for an hundred?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obiection.</note>Neither let any obiect this: That ſome will indanger themſelues by a great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> robberie,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> who will not haue their hand in ſmall pilfring. For, as that is no proofe of faithfulneſſe in the perſons: ſo it cannot ouerthrow Chriſts words which cannot be reſiſted, that is to ſay; If a man will make ſhipwracke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and credite for a ſmall benefit, he will do it much more for a greater. A great and maine reaſon doubtleſſe,<note place="margin">The abuſe of riches, a heauy vvitneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt men.</note> why a man ſhould be true and truſtie, plaine and ſimple in and about worldly things, and commit no vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neither offer any iniurie to inrich himſelfe thereby; when that ſhall be an vtter diſcharging him of the fauour of God, and a fruſtrating of all his hope of heauen and happineſſe. Therefore if we looke for any benefit by Chriſt, any comfort by the Goſpell, and any communion with the Saints, and in a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> word, if we looke to reape any fruite of our holy profeſſion; looke we to it, that we be reformed in this part of our conuerſation; and if we deſire to vſe well and rightly things ſpirituall which are the chiefeſt, let vs not be looſe, or (which is worſe) vnconſcionable in theſe earthly things which are the meaneſt.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt reaſon to perſwade hereto, is this: that we ſhall giue
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:16851:246"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> an account, as of other things which we haue done in our life,<note place="margin">VVe ſhall giue an account.</note> whether they be good or bad; ſo eſpecially of our getting, vſing and forgoing of our goods and commodities: as appeareth by the parable of the talents,<note place="margin">Math. 25.14.</note> deliuered to be occupied, till it ſhould be demanded how they were imployed:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke 16.2.</hi> Hovv it ſhall be demanded.</note> and by that of the ſteward, who was called to giue an account of his ſtewardſhip. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which ſhall then be demaunded, ſhall be according to the doctrine which hath bene ſet downe in the foure remedies: namely, whether we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> haue not vſed them to the hurt and iniurying of others: and how long, and wherein. And ſecondly, whether we haue done good with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as we in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> haue ſeene our ſelues bound to do, and as occaſion hath bene offered. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Thirdly, whether we haue not our ſelues yeelded to commit ſome noiſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and fearefull ſinnes, for and by occaſion of them, which we ſhould not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe haue bene bold to do. And laſtly, whether we haue bene furthered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> by them to euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>By this we ſee, we may not deale and behaue our ſelues about theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodities, as we ſhall thinke good: for we are but ſtewards and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of them, as the owner our Lord and maiſter hath appointed. Wherein as we haue failed, we ſhall haue litle cauſe to reioyce, conſidering that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we haue gotten and gained, yet the worſt is behind:<note place="margin">Note.</note> euen our account giuing, which we ſhall not be able to yeeld, no not one of a thouſand. And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> though I deny not, <hi>but there is mercy with the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 130.4.</note> and plentifull redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet it is, <hi>that he may be feared</hi> of vs for the time to come, in occupying our goods and talents as he hath commaunded: and it is alſo for them that tremble, when in remembring and thinking how ill they haue vſed them,<note place="margin">Ier. 8.6.</note> they ſay penitently within themſelues, <hi>What haue we done?</hi> But to the reſt ſhall be tribulation and anguiſh, when they not wiſely caſting their recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before, ſhall be vrged to it by the Lord, they being vtterly vnready for it. In this regard therefore, as in all the former, we ſee good cauſe to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand carefully this ſinne of worldlineſſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the remedies,<note place="margin">Direction how to vſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies and reaſons.</note> and reaſons which perſwade to giue a foile to this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> couetouſneſſe: now heare the direction in few words, how to vſe them both. For although we know them, yet if they do but ſwimme in our braine, and be talked of now and then, they ſhall be ſo farre off from doing vs the good they may do, that we ſhall the rather deceiue our ſelues with a falſe conceit of practiſing them, when yet we remaine drowned in ſome groſſe point of worldlineſſe ſtill. Therfore it is neceſſarie, that we nouriſh and retaine a mind willing to ſee and find out what is amiſſe in vs this way: and then, as the ſins of this kind are moſt daungerous and many; that therefore we force our ſelues from day to day to ſtoupe and ſubmit our ſelues in an honeſt and good heart, to vſe theſe remedies, and be perſwaded by theſe reaſons, till we find <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> eaſe by them, through practiſe of them: that is, a ready mind to vſe the world ſoberly and aright, and deſirous (leſt we ſhould deceiue our ſelues through ſelfe-loue) both to learne by the publicke miniſterie, and by our priuate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as alſo by the helpe of any faithfull brother, (which can ſhew vs) what blemiſh remaineth to annoy and hurt vs. Thus vſing both remedies and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from time to time, (for this muſt be no worke of a dayes or a yeares continuance) with feruent prayer to God both to ſee and caſt out ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:16851:247"/>
we ſhall not need to doubt, but that we ſhall be bleſſed in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A preoccupier.</note>And yet this I will adde: (becauſe I know that the matter which I haue ſet downe for the redreſſe of couetouſneſſe, will ſauour but harſhly in the taſt of worldly minded Chriſtians) that I do not in all that I haue ſayd, ſpeake or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt any libertie that God alloweth his people, about the vſe of the world (for ſome will be ready ſo to gather.<note place="margin">This forbiddeth the vſe of no lavvfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</note>) For concerning skill and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in mens trades, dealings and occupyings, I am ſo farre from counting them points or properties of couetouſneſſe, that I hold them for comely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, if they be not choaked and ouer-growne with the weedes of their corruptions.<note place="margin">As in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</note> Yea I ſay more, that ignorance and vnskilfulneſſe (if ye except <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the contrarie extremities: ſubtilty and craftineſſe) is one of the greateſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of euill dealing among men. Alſo I deny not but that forecaſting and thrifty prouidence in a familie,<note place="margin">Gen 41.35.36.</note> is both lawfull and meete, and that no more be ſpent, then for neceſſarie and comfortable vſe; to make prouiſion alſo of things needfull in the fitteſt time, ſo as it be without fraudulent dealing in fore-hand bargaines; alſo good husbandrie, warineſſe in their doings, ſure bindings of men in their contracts and couenants; and ſufficient ſecuritie (for mortalitie ſake) euen betwixt the beſt, by writings or witneſſe; and a taking heed of ſuretiſhip (as <hi>Salomon</hi> willeth) that one be not vndone by another;<note place="margin">Prou. 6.1.</note> diligence alſo in mens callings; with ſuch other like: religion and Gods word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> alloweth them all.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Note.</note>And all to this end, that the more outward dangers a man can auoide, the more free he may be to liue godly.

he is taught;<note place="margin">1.

               <p>But let Gods louing kindneſſe ſhewed to our ſoules, (becauſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed vpon vs euery day) prouoke vs in all eſtates, to be true and faithfull to him: and let vs not ſerue him for his outward benefites; although I deny not but that we may haue more libertie thereby, both to doe our duties to him and to our brethren, and that more plentifully then in wants and neceſſitie. And as it behoueth vs thus to vſe proſperitie, as that we may not abuſe it: ſo,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> if we haue (by any occaſion) bene turned out of the way, let vs ſuſpect our falſe hearts the more afterward; to withdraw them further off from the loue of the world, and in token of our repentance and pardon obtained, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge our ſelues;<note place="margin">Luk. 19.8.</note> yea, if there be cauſe, to make reſtitution as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did.</p>
               <p>But to proceed: Another occaſion the diuell taketh of quenching grace in vs,<note place="margin">Another let, is by family-matters.</note> by family-matters: about the which he ſo buſieth and occupieth our heades, that right good Chriſtians do perceiue themſelues ſooner to take hurt thereby,<note place="margin">Note.</note> then they can eſpie it; and ſee themſelues vnſetled thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are aware. And that is, in the varietie and multitude of worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> when either they are more then with the practiſe of chriſtianitie we can looke to; or being not ſo, yet they being ſundrie and diuerſe, our hearts are wholly taken vp with them, and ſo they become vnſetled and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, eſpecially becauſe we are wont to deale raſhly, looſely and vnaduiſedly in the moſt outward things we go about. For otherwiſe, we taking our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full workes in hand aduiſedly and watchfully, and walking circumſpectly in our diuerſe affaires, the diuell cannot ſo eaſily preuaile againſt vs, whiles we are carefully taking heed to our wayes, and confidently perſwaded, that God alloweth vs and is pleaſed with vs in the doing of them. But (to ſay the truth) the moſt part euen of good Chriſtians,<note place="margin">The better ſort ouertaken this way.</note> attaine not to this grace in houſhold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> affaires and matters about their maintenance, thereby ſo moderately and warily to carie themſelues, as that they auoide the common hurts which the moſt men do ſuſtaine, that is: an vnquiet mind, diſtracted or vnſetled with ſome other corruption by occaſion of ſo many dealings. In which caſe they make themſelues (as I haue ſaid before) vtterly vnfit to do any good for a time: yea and ſo abide for a long ſpace, if they haue not the more tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:16851:249"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to call them backe the ſooner.<note place="margin">A cauſe therof.</note> For both they themſelues haue bene wont through cuſtome, to be haſtie, forgetfull and vnwatchfull in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and haue ſeene it ſo common a thing with others to do the ſame, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they come euen from prayer, or from a Sermon, yet can they hardly ſpeake or do any thing about their buſineſſe and dealings, but they ſhall too eaſily ſhew and bewray, how farre they be from hauing their conuerſation in heauen, while they are occupied here on the earth; and that, it being a thing ſo common to be vnſetled, wounded and ſore ſhaken by earthly dealings and commodities.</p>
               <p>And another great cauſe there is of this ſinne, and that is:<note place="margin">Another cauſe.</note> a perſwaſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> rooted in them, that no man how godly ſoeuer he be, can go about them with an heauenly mind; and that a Chriſtian is not tyed to meaſure and ſquare out his earthly and domeſticall affaires after the rules of Scripture, but that euery man is to do herein as he ſeeth good; &amp; that he can do ſuch things of his owne head, without helpe of the word of God. Which opinion is ſo deeply ſetled in mens minds through ſathans crafty beguiling of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the moſt euen of thoſe who be of good hope, are both at home, and about their dealings in the world, with wife, ſeruant, neighbour or ſtraunger, oftentimes more like bruite beaſtes or franticke perſons, then ſober and religious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. And it may be eaſily gathered, that they tye all religion for the moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> part, to the publike place: that is to ſay, to go to the church once in a weeke, to do as others do there, and to order other matters after their owne diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So litle do ſuch conſider what the Apoſtle hath taught:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.31.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether we eate or drinke, &amp;c.</hi> And againe: <hi>Do theſe things, as though ye did them not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when men giue this libertie to themſelues, not to be directed by God in their moſt common dealings, and when the diuell hath brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this point: who ſeeth not, how euery thing which they are occupied about,<note place="margin">Fruites of the heart vnſetled, by occaſion of family-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> is made a let and a ſnare to them, and becommeth a blocke in their way, which they ſtumble at? A man ſhall not ſpeake to his wife, but he breaketh into frowardneſſe: one neighbour contendeth, falleth out with, and raileth at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> another for a matter of nothing: and one is vnquiet with ſeruants, vexed at children, yea curſing them that euer they were borne, impatient and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at euery thing which goeth againſt him: fretting, if any man ſaue a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie by him, though it be by good and lawfull dealing: reioycing, if he can pull ought to himſelfe from any: and infinite other ſuch. And this is the life of many: yet, who is wiſe to ſee and marke this, but that the diuell may leade the moſt (as it were) blindfolded, whither ſoeuer he will?</p>
               <p>A wiſe man will therefore (I hope) better conſider this,<note place="margin">How to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die it.</note> and learne to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden himſelfe of multitudes of worldly dealings and buſineſſe, ſeeing they ſuffer not the mind to be free: and to ſubdue his affections, ſo (as I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> taught him) that he may haue them ruled and vnder gouernment, in one part of his life as well as in another, and about family-matters as well as thoſe which are moſt weightie.

                  <hi>to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and his way.</hi> This I haue ſayd, that the Reader may ſee what manifold lets there are, firſt in our ſelues through the corruption that is within vs: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> then without vs, by the Diuell raiſed vp againſt vs, (which is not perſwaded to many, as were meete it ſhould:) that we may ſee iuſt cauſe to be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the armour of Chriſtians and other helpes before mentioned, by the which onely God hath appointed ſafe deliuerance from theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned lets and annoyances.</p>
               <p>He who ſhall be found willing to liue after a Chriſtian direction daily, ſhall more eaſily be brought to feare, and ſo withſtand theſe and like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that they diſguiſe him not, making him to ſeeme as other men, who feare not God. Wherein more ſpecially, we muſt looke to our ſelues, that we wiſely auoide and preuent the occaſion of theſe, ſeeing we know how we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> haue ſmarted by them: and when we cannot altogether auoide them, yet to arme our ſelues by reſolute couenant and feruent prayer againſt them; and when we haue bene ouercome by any of them, we muſt ſee it, and marke our weakneſſe, and pray more earneſtly, and giue not ouer: and Gods grace ſhall be ſufficient for vs, both to quiet our minds by hope of pardon, and to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our ſinnes afterwards.</p>
               <p>And by theſe impediments from the conſtant holding out in a godly life,<note place="margin">VVhat obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations are to be gathered from this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the lets.</note> it may be ſeene, that it is no idle occupation to be a true Chriſtian, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo: and that his worke is not a ceremonious tasking of himſelfe with reading ſome prayers or other things, when he thinks good or be inioyned it; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which yet (as litle labour as it coſteth men) would be neglected oft,<note place="margin">The firſt.</note> both of miniſter and people, if they were not tied to it.<note place="margin">The ſecond.</note> Alſo we may ſee what need the ſeruants of God haue, to guard themſelues ſtrongly, and ſo to abide, as hath bene ſhewed before: and to be acquainted with Sathans crafts and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, and by what means they be repelled and reſiſted.<note place="margin">The third.</note> And that their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are ſomtime ſo forcible, that they are not ſubdued and ouercome,<note place="margin">The fourth.</note> but giue them a fall into ſome open ſinne, (for the which cauſe S.<note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>Paul</hi> admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, that men quench not the ſpirit, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19.) yea into the ſame ſinne after repentance; but to the end they may riſe againe by the remedies appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them by the Lord himſelfe in that behalfe. And here we may ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> therefore, how they be toſſed as the ſhip by the waues of the ſea:<note place="margin">The fift.</note> ſometime aloft in vaine hope and confidence, that they are ſafe and in good eſtate, and yet nothing ſo: and at other times, caſt downe and plunged into the depth and bottome of feares, yea of very diſpairing: which was the eſtate of <hi>Peter,</hi> when neither he, nor any other (when he forſware his maiſter) thought he could haue bene pardoned. And this is their miſerie, that they are euer for the moſt part caried (when they be not well ſtayed and faſt ſetled in faith and
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:16851:252"/>
hope) into extremities. And yet (a thing moſt admirable) they are neuer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they are thus exerciſed. For as the yron that is vnoccupied, doth ſoone waxe ruſtie, and the ſtone that lieth ſtill, is couered with moſſe: ſo they, if they be not examining and obſeruing themſelues, conſidering their ſtate, watching ouer their hearts, fore-ſeeing dangers comming, and learning experience by things paſt, and in ſuch like maner occupied for the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, they waxe barren and vnprofitable, euen the beſt; and in time, do breake out dangerouſly.</p>
               <p>And as they are in no eſtate ſafer, then when they are thus exerciſed: ſo would not they themſelues be put out of that courſe, neither are weary of it, though they depriue themſelues of many liberties thereby; but deſire to hold <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> conſtantly in that well fenced and ſafe courſe, (this being added, That they may haue the grace which is ſufficient for them.<note place="margin">The ſixt.</note>) Furthermore, by theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments with their like, ſo many and ſore, the faithfull may ſee what they are beholding to God, &amp; how deeply they be indebted to him, that for all the rage and violence of their temptations; yea ſo ſore, as ſometime they may commit a ſinne of preſumption,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.13.</note> and be in ſome kind of diſpairing: yet God ſendeth a calme againe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.11.</note> and a deliuerance out of their deepeſt ſorrowes and feares. For as <hi>Iacob</hi> wraſtled with the Angell; and when he was hurt, would not depart til he had bleſſed him: euen ſo, the ſeruants of God haue conflicts with the Lord himſelfe:<note place="margin">Gen. 32.28.</note> who keepeth them downe with one hand and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> them vp with the other, that ſo he may exerciſe their faith, that it may not be vnoccupied. Laſt of all, by this doctrine of the lets of faith and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the children of God that they ſhine not out ſo clearly in them, we may ſee, that they behaue not themſelues in their ſtriuing againſt ſin and in going vnder their afflictions, as the wicked do: (who the more loade the Lord layeth on them,<note place="margin">Exod. 8. Pſal. 23. Iob. 13.</note> the more they murmure and rebell:) but they when they haue the greateſt ſufferings, they ſtriue to truſt in him, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure do ſo; and are ſtrengthened with greater power of Chriſt, and ioyfulnes: <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. Alſo they, though they feele the power and rebellion of ſinne, as well as the other,<note place="margin">Pſal. 130.1. &amp;c. Prou. 9.17.</note> yet they hate it with a perfite hatred, and would not be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> drawne with the coardes of it at all, and ſo looke to Gods mercy through Chriſt: But the other, would not let go their hold of ſinne, the taſt thereof is ſo ſweet to them: if they breake off, it is againſt their will, and for feare of Gods wrath,<note place="margin">Math. 7.22.</note> neither lay they hold indeed of pardon. Theſe obſeruations Gods ſeruants may make by this doctrine of the lets, and many other ſuch, to their ſingular benefit. And what ſhould I ſay more? For it were infinite almoſt, to ſay all that might be ſayd to the like purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now it remaineth, that in few words they be put in mind, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themſelues better and better with the Chriſtian life; and daily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and ſolace themſelues in it, I meane, in one part or other of it (for it hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> great variety.<note place="margin">The great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt them all.</note>) For howſoeuer there fall out many difficulties in their liues; yet know they, that they ſhall be fewer and weaker, as they themſelues grow more in knowledge, and ſtronger in faith and other grace. And although before they be brought to yeeld themſelues to them, many darke miſts are caſt before their eyes, to extenuate and make ſmall the ſinnes which they ſhould commit, both by hiding the puniſhment, and couertly obiecting the
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:16851:252"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> mercy of God: yet let them know, that if they haue once committed them, they ſhall be aggrauated as faſt on the other ſide, as that there is no mercy for them with God. And let it be remembred, that occaſions to prouoke to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſhall neuer be wanting, nor in no place, but ſhall be miniſtred, rather then not at all, euen by things not euill of their owne nature (as hath beene ſayd) as ſhall be fit for the diſpoſition of euery man, yea euen in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Gods people, that they may not be bold at any time to caſt off feare of danger. But let them fight the good fight of faith, and lay hold of eternall life, and follow ſuch good helpe as they haue receiued and learned of God: and ſo doing, though they find not the comfort ſome time, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but feare, becauſe of their preſent ſtriuings and conflicts; yet I dare aſſure them (the Lord hauing ſpoken it) that they know not the happie fruite and end of that which ſeemeth their greateſt miſerie: for they ſhall reape the fruit of righteouſneſſe in peace, when they haue bene exerciſed with their trials, and haue waited a while with patience.</p>

               <p>In the yeare 1588, there met in a Chriſtian mans houſe certaine well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſons, which dwelt in one towne together, with whom alſo the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the place did meete at the ſame time. Their meeting was for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of loue, and for the edifying one of another, after ſome bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt &amp; refreſhing. And yet know, that they were no Browniſts: for they were diligent and ordinarie frequenters of publicke aſſemblies with the people of God. Neither were their meetings Conuenticles, for the diſturbing of the ſtate of the Church and peace thereof; as many imagine that there can be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> no priuate fellowſhip among Chriſtians, but it is to ſuch ends: the contrary may be ſeene by their conference. Theſe with one conſent, fell into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication how the caſe ſtood betwixt God and themſelues.</p>
               <p>Some accuſing and complaining of themſelues, that they had not vſed their long continued peace and libertie of the Goſpell to the end for which God did ſend both: but that they had bene dimme lights. The reſt conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and by occaſion offered among them all (well nigh twentie perſons)
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:16851:253"/>
ſundry reaſons and proofes were ſet downe, to make their complaints more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> weighty; and alſo what euill fruite they did ſee to proceed from ſuch a dead and vnprofitable courſe of liuing: and yet the perſons ſpoken of, did as farre exceed the common ſort of them that profeſſe the Goſpell, as the common profeſſors do exceed them in religion, which know not the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>When they had proceeded thus farre, it was demaunded, whether there were no way to come out of this weariſome and vnprofitable life, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming ſuch as imbraced the Goſpell. If there were any: what might be the fitteſt and beſt remedies to come out of ſuch bondage (for they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it no better:) and betwixt them they agreed vpon certaine, with ſuch good liking, after they heard and conceiued them, that it might appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> be ſeene, that their heauy hearts were much eaſed, when they did but ſee a way to be deliuered from that yoke of bondage; whiles their plentifull teares were turned into chearfull countenance. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was this, they did couenant faithfully and ſeriouſly, to ſet vpon theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies forthwith and ſpeedily; thinking that ſuch a weighty matter had need of no delay: and thereupon, deſired the Preacher to ſet downe the ſumme of their conference and communication together, for the better put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them in rememberance of it to practiſe it; as alſo that they might ſee what the ſumme of their conference was: which, ſeeing they agreed vnto, they called a Couenant.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>

               <p>Now it may be, ye looke to heare what fruite there came of this: ſurely euen this meeting was a great whetting them on to inioy the publicke mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie more chearfully and fruitfully afterwards: and this meane with others, both publicke and priuate, did knit them in that loue, the bond whereof could not be broken, either on their part which now ſleepe in the Lord, whiles they here liued; nor in them which yet remaine, by any aduerſary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer vnto this day.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> our ſelues, who yet had hope, and that not ſmall, that we had a part therein: we ſaw iuſt cauſe why we ſhould confeſſe, that we had bene much wanting herein, and that the patterne of our life was farre vnlike this rule, when we compared the one with the other: and therefore complained with bitternes, that we had fallen into a deepe ſlumber, being rather ready to thinke our ſelues in ſafety, then carefully looking to thoſe teſtimonies in our ſelues, which might indeed aſſure vs of it. Whereupon we fell into an heauie and bitter complaint in this maner, with plenty of teares: Oh, we ſee now,<note place="margin">The complaint.</note> that we haue not walked with the Lord, as by diligent marking the examples of other deare ſeruants of his, we haue found that they haue done: nor hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> our God in the courſe of our life, according to the mercifull occaſions and incouragements which he hath giuen vs. The feruent care and earneſt zeale which we ſee required in the people of God, hath bene much wanting and cold, in reſpect of that which we might well haue attained vnto. And as we ſee now more clearly, that our blockiſh and vnprofitable life was not glorious to God, nor beſeeming vs who ſhould haue ſtood foorth among the reſt of Gods people to giue light vnto others: ſo we did many times feare it before, and thinke, that whatſoeuer vnprofitableneſſe and coldneſſe is to be ſeene in many other weake Chriſtians who behold and liue with vs, it might rightly be imputed to vs, from whom and ſuch other they commonly take <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> direction. This and the like we complained of: and leſt we ſhould ſeeme to make it a matter of courſe, and to ſhew no manifeſt cauſe hereof, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſuch proofe of the ſame, as our wofull experience hath yeelded and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorded.</p>
                  <p>That this complaint therefore may iuſtly be made,<note place="margin">The firſt proofe of the iuſtneſſe of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</note> it appeareth in all thoſe duties pertaining either to God or man: our ſelues or other. For in all we haue failed manifoldly: whereas yet by meane or indifferent heed-taking, in great part we might haue done better. Concerning God, we haue not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed ſuch glory to his name, and ſhewed foorth his louing kindneſſe to the ſonnes of men, as we ought and might haue done: neither glorified his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as, if it ſhould haue bene taken from vs, we would haue promiſed to do.<note place="margin">The ſecond proofe.</note> Further, it may appeare hereby, that we ſee we haue not profited in the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge of the will of God anſwerably to our time, and to the helpes which we haue inioyed for that purpoſe.<note place="margin">Seeing the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ſeeking of knowledge by studie, is one meane to come by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we must not ceaſe, till we can haue delight in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> For many of vs are as yet but weakly ſetled in the chiefe points of chriſtian religion: much leſſe are we fit hearers, with ready minds to put in vre any doctrine which ſhall be neceſſarily, ſoundly and faithfully deliuered vnto vs. Nay, we muſt needs confeſſe to our ſhame, that the meanes to come by knowledge, haue bene very negligently vſed of vs: as, ſeldome reading; and in hearing, not vſually preparing our hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come, with caſting off the ſinnes which might hinder vs, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> with meekneſſe: neither in hearing, haue bene diligently attending and hearkning to the voyce of God; neither after our hearing, haue vſually meditated or communed with other of that which we haue heard.<note place="margin">The third proofe.</note> So that this hath not bene our delight, but with much vnreuerence (for ſo holy and heauenly a ſeruice) gone about. Moreouer, we haue not ſo tamed our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, and ſo ſet our ſelues againſt the ſame in many particulars, ſo as we haue preuailed ouer it in our temptations: (for we haue thought

this too tedious and irkeſome for vs:) but we haue fauoured exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and giuen too much libertie to our ſelues in our ſinnes; not readie to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and withſtand the ſame, as either ſome of vs ſometime haue done, or as we haue ſeene other of Gods ſeruants to haue done as <hi>Ioſeph (Gen.</hi> 39.) did in onetime; <hi>Moiſes</hi> (Hebr. 11.24.) in another. Yet the meanes which we vſe ſometimes to obtaine grace, if they were continued, would bring to paſſe ſome effects this way not to be complained of: therefore ſeeing we thus faile herein,<note place="margin">The deſire ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, doth (vvithout great grace) make a man more ſecure and in greater daunger.</note> we muſt needes complaine bitterly. And what is like to be a greater hinderer of true godlineſſe in vs, then this tender bearing with our ſelues in our ſinnes, as being hardly brought to offer any violence vnto them: when yet we know, that the ſmalleſt euen of our euill luſtes, do fight againſt our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſoules, are ranke poyſon vnto vs, and haue need to be driuen out with moſt ſtrong medicines?</p>
                  <p>And as concerning the daunger of fauouring our ſelues in our ſinnes, though ſecret and ſmaller then many ſinnes ſeeme, theſe fearefull effects haue followed: that hauing winked at the ſmaller, we haue ruſhed and bene plunged into greater: and not chaſing away light and wandring deſires, we haue fallen into deeper and more dangerous delighting in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">The daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fruite of fauouring our ſelues in our ſinnes.</note> which hauing once taken hold of vs, could not with ten times ſo much ado be remoued: yea by this ſleight ſtriuing againſt ſome, we haue bene ouercome of many and ſundrie other. Some haue taken great hurt by worldlineſſe, decaying as faſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in grace and goodneſſe, as they haue gone on with too much intemperan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and exceſſe in that deceiueableneſſe: ſome haue growne into great cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in apparent ſecuritie haue not eſpied their eſtate once to be chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; but haue kept a kind of perſwaſion, that they haue bene in as good caſe for all this, as euer they were when greateſt care was in them: ſome haue bin readie with conceitedneſſe and froward iudging to breake off their courſe of Chriſtian walking ſometime, and their fellowſhip and communion with their brethren. Oftentimes ſuch an acquaintance hath growne by this fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our ſelues in ſome one, with falling into many, yea and thoſe very perillous, (as ſtrangeneſſe betwixt neighbours, hollowneſſe, vntruſtineſſe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> iarrings, a growing after the common ſort, ſlow growing on in that which yet was our profeſſion, with many other ſuch annoyances) that it may well be ſaid, that fearefull effects haue followed this bearing of our ſelues, euen in vs who haue bene thought to be of the forwarder ſort. Now when theſe and ſuch like vnſauourie fruites haue come from vs, and that we haue in ſuch like manner (as hath bene ſaid) walked in the world, what hath bene our eſtate and condition, but that which might well enough beſeeme ſuch as haue in no carefull ſort bene profeſſors of religion?</p>
                  <p>Our comfort hath bene flatterie, and deceiuing of our ſelues: our feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and zeale, which ought ſtill to haue increaſed, hath bene benummed and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> turned into ſenſleſſe bockiſhneſſe: our companie vnprofitable, if not hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dangerous: and when we haue in any manner looked into our ſelues, wound of conſcience and terror hath bene found within vs, ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch hath bene without; or (which is worſe then both) hardneſſe of heart hath ouergrowne vs. As for the Lord, neither could we, neither durſt we haue our recourſe vnto him: and from any beſides him, we knew no
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:16851:254"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſound co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort could be attained. To forget this our miſerie, was impoſſible; &amp; to be thinking of it, intollerable: and ſo betwixt the one and the other we could not be (when we were at the beſt) but moſt vncomfortable. But yet we liuing through Gods goodneſſe, vnder the miniſterie of the word, could not be ſo forgetfull of that which had bene in vs, nor ſo blockiſh in thinking and conſidering of that which was taught vs, neither all religion ſo vtterly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in vs, but that the ſparkles of zeale which were in vs, muſt needes be kindled one time or other: by meanes whereof, we were enforced to ſee a maruellous decay of godlineſſe, and a chaunge from that which had bene in vs; and thereby were driuen into exceeding heauineſſe, to behold from what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> we had falne, and yet vtterly vnable to recouer our ſelues againe for the time. If ſometime by more earneſt ſtirring vp of our ſelues, we could obtaine this of our ſelues, to humble our hearts before God by prayer, confeſſion of our ſinne, &amp;c. (which yet in ſuch a caſe we were brought to very hardly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we had greateſt need:) yet we may behold here what a bitter fruite we reaped (and that alſo long continuing with vs) of our forenamed liberty ſeeking, and for giuing the beginnings of ſinne ſuch intertainment within vs.</p>
                  <p>Another proofe, that this our complaint is iuſt, is:<note place="margin">The fourth proofe.</note> that we haue not ſo growne in grace and in the fruites of godlineſſe, that we haue bene hereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable in the eyes of God and of his good ſeruants, neither haue we taken vp <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> our delight in labouring after them: as for example, In our afflictions and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als we haue not felt our ſelues contented, that the Lord ſhould exerciſe vs as it hath bene ſeene good to him: we haue not ouercome impatience in them, much leſſe reioyced in bearing them, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. We haue not taken occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by Gods bleſſings, of libertie, peace, health, fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, proſperitie &amp; ſuch like, to be more fruitfull and chearefull in doing all good duties, as occaſion hath bene offered: lowlineſſe, meekeneſſe, kind-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe, faithfulneſſe to men, ſinceritie to God in the good things which we haue done, haue oft and much bene wanting: very ſparie and niggardly we are in prayer, meditation, triall of our ſelues, and labouring to know ſinne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> better, and confeſſing againſt our ſelues that which we know: ſoone wearie of well doing, yet not grieued at it; vnwearied in things needleſſe. We ſo hardly and ſlightly ſee the neceſſitie of practiſe of many duties and precepts, which by doctrine are commended vnto vs, that we reſt in that which hath bene, and coldly ariſe vp to any new or further proceeding. Our crucifying of our ſelues to the world, that we might be content to be deſpiſed and of litle account in it; or our crucifying of the world vnto our ſelues, that it might not bleare our eyes with the vanitie and deceiueable inticements and baites of it, hath bene very faintly gone about of vs: our experience in marking the courſe of Gods dealings towards vs, in comforting vs after well doing, in letting vs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> feele that an hundred fold for the forſaking of any part of our will: alſo in this chaſtiſing of vs for our ſecuritie or other defaults, alas it is very ſmall. So that neither may it be ſufficient for vs to encourage others to a godly life vpon our owne triall (it is ſo weake;) neither is it ſuch, as miniſtreth any great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or direction to our ſelues to hold on in a good courſe: and yet how frozen and faint our perſwading and encouraging of others is, when we are not well ſetled our ſelues; it may be conſidered with griefe enough to him
<pb facs="tcp:16851:255"/>
that liſteth to weigh it. Our litle watching of our hearts againſt folly, or of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whole life, that in our ſolitarineſſe we might commune with the Lord and our owne hearts, in companie be fit to do good or take good, that euill might be farre from vs; may iuſtly ſhame and feare vs to thinke of: our litle labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring through loue (as our callings will permit) to be fruitfull and occupied in that which might increaſe our peace, and vphold our chriſtian eſtate, is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable. And thus by this, and ſuch other like, it may eaſily appeare, that ſeeing we may charge our ſelues in this wiſe, we haue good cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that it is not with vs as it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The fifth proof.</note>And from theſe accuſations ariſeth another: that we take too liberall an vſe of lawfull things; neuer ſuſpecting that any hurt or daunger can thereby <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> come vnto vs; as in diet, apparell, ſleepe, the vſe of mariage, dealings in the world, and talking thereof: forgetting that which the holy Ghoſt hath taught vs; that is, that theſe lawfull things, namely, pleaſures and profites, are called ſnares, and therefore eaſily able to intangle men and hold them faſt; ſo as it ſhall be hard for them to runne the race of chriſtian dutie required of them: and that they are ſaid to preſſe men downe; that by meanes of them, they cannot with ſuch chearefulneſſe and fruite liue vnto God. Wherein to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, this may ſerue vs for a rule: that as euery one of vs can ſee what is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ſo we beſtow no more time about the world then we needes muſt, neither in talke nor other dealings: fearing withall, leſt we ſhould be caried <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to loue it too much: wherein the more that euery man laboureth to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come himſelfe, that his chearefulneſſe in good duties may not be hindered; ſo much the more he ſhall haue to reioyce, that he hath bene content to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge his owne delight for better things.</p>
                  <p>Another proofe of this our iuſt complaint, is: that we haue had litle fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the wants and miſeries of others.<note place="margin">The ſixt proof.</note> To ſee how many thouſands walke ignorantly; other many, in ſecuritie, hypocriſie, ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. many to haue fallen away vtterly, after they had receiued a taſt of the Goſpell: who ſhould not be moued at the beholding of it? and pitie them, as much as in him ſhold lye? and not to be content, that we our ſelues ſhould do well, whiles we ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſo many in calamitie. But it cannot be denyed, but that their eſtate, either of the deſolate beyond the ſeas, in many countries; or of the diſtreſſed ones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, doth litle touch or come neare vs: whereby as our prayers are weake which are made in their behalfe, ſo are the other fruites of our compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſmall and few. For as liberalitie is cold in reſpect of the abilitie which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue, ſo few of vs are grieued at their euils, or go about to call backe and reclaime ſuch as we may: we haue not much ſet our minds on this, how we might beſt preuaile with, and draw our kindred, acquaintance, familiars, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, &amp;c. neither of purpoſe to order our wayes ſo, as we might by our holy conuerſation winne either theſe, or ſtraungers to God: neither to ſtrengthen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the weake, and helpe forward ſuch as haue bene at a ſtaggering. And that which is more, if we haue done any of theſe, yet we haue done it more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerly and coldly, whether with our families, or other with whome we haue had to do that way:<note place="margin">The cauſes of theſe defaults.</note> not in meekeneſſe, loue, compaſſion, bearing as there hath bene cauſe with them, or heartily ſeeking to winne them vnto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The firſt.</note>The cauſe hereof was no one; but yet chiefly our euill hearts: which for all
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:16851:255"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the taſt of holy doctrine, and light which we had of the life to come, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleanſed and renued but in part, were euermore in reſpect of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prone to euill, and vnapt to goodneſſe; ſo that, not onely after good meanes vſing, they caried vs to a forgetfulneſſe of that good which was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vs, either in prayer, conference, or the miniſterie of the word, and to a ſenſible deſire at leaſt of ſome declining; but euen in the time of our enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, our hearts deceiued vs, that we could not make (I ſpeake of the moſt times) any great vſe or profite of them at all. But that the euill of the heart may the better appeare, and ſo the cauſe of our vnprofitableneſſe the more clearely be ſeene, it ſhall be good to ſet downe ſome of the particular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> corruptions of it, and how eaſily they breake foorth and ſhew themſelues by the ſmalleſt occaſions. Now the heart is deceiptfull, whereby when we are towards or in the way to great daunger, yet we are not willing, or not able to ſee and decline it.

It is alſo idle and ſlouthfull in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> going about dutie: yea and vntoward in the ſame. It is fraught with ſelf-loue, which is, when we fauour our ſelues too much, and pleaſe our ſelues in our ſinnes, when yet the ſmalleſt prouocations thereto, ſhould diſpleaſe vs.</p>
                  <p>Earthly-mindedneſſe is another ſtreame running from this fountaine, when we are drawne to the loue of the commodities of this world, and are led with a deſire of growing rich: which ſnareth vs, and calleth backe our minds from liuing holily, and cauſeth ſuch as wiſely reſiſt it, not to haue their treaſure in the earth. In prayer great coldneſſe and wearineſſe of wel-doing poſſeſſeth (as it were) this heart of ours, when by any occaſion we haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it: anger, malice and reuengement, in degree one exceeding the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> do eaſily appeare to haue their abode in this hart: pride of heart, though ſometime priuie, is one among the reſt, which poyſoneth our beſt actions, and ſoone ariſeth when any good hath bene done of vs: the repining at the gifts of other, doth many times aſſault vs: what barrenneſſe and emptineſſe of Gods grace is too commonly found in vs, our wofull experience doth cauſe vs to remember: vncleane deſires (among the reſt) are here: an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable rabble of other vnſauourie, daungerous and carnall thoughts do ſwarme in vs: and temperancie and moderation is ſo meanely reached vnto, that we can hardly be merie without lightneſſe; ſad without vnfruitfull dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhneſſe; beleeuing God without preſuming; or feare him without ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> doubtings and inclinings to diſpairing. Theſe here ſet downe, with others many like vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing place in our harts, &amp; long continuance, without any occaſion offered do ſet themſelues a worke in vs; but eſpecially by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions do fearefully breake out from vs, we being (if we could marke it) not long without ſome of them whatſoeuer we go about. What maruell though other cauſes did not go with them, if by meanes of theſe we ſhould haue our beſt actions blemiſhed, yea poyſoned, and our common behauiour and

                  </p>
                  <p>But now, when theſe ſhall be let looſe in vs, when they are not holden in as it were with bit and bridle, when they ſhall gouerne vs, and not wee them,<note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe.</note> but we become ſlaues &amp; ſeruants vnto them: how can it be otherwiſe, but that our liues ſhould giue litle light vnto men and glorie to God; and for all our profeſſion of the Goſpell, and the account that we make of it, yet that the fore-mentioned offences be found in vs? And this is the ſecond cauſe why we bring foorth no greater fruites of amendement. For when our harts which in themſelues are too euill, ſhall wander where they will without checke, and feed themſelues by occaſions without controulment, litle wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ouer them, or keeping in of them with diligent care and obſeruing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> them; full eaſily and right ſoone is this vnſetledneſſe and vnprofitableneſſe, which we complained of, ingendred in vs: and ſo, bringeth foorth fruite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, euen like vnto it ſelfe, as hath bene ſaid. Now for our owne parts, we cannot but confeſſe and remember againſt our ſelues, that we haue either not knowne many of theſe forenamed corruptions; and therefore could not vſe any violence againſt them: or if we haue ſeene them in our ſelues, yet haue we made light matters of them, dallied with them, and delighted in them; and if time or other dealings haue not brought vs into the forgetfulneſſe of them, yet with ſome ſodaine ſighes and weake miſlikings, they haue bene beheld of vs: which hath bene no decaying nor cutting off of ſo ranck corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> but that they haue budded foorth againe immediatly, and ſo haue ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our actions with their bitter leauen moſt daungerouſly. Whereas, if we had bene iealous ouer them, if we had firſt cleanſed and purged our hearts of them; if we, knowing that the greateſt offences before men, are firſt nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heart to the prouoking of God, and therefore had ſet our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: we ſhould haue ſeene, that with much comfort to our ſelues, in ſound practiſe of dutie, we ſhould haue proceeded in our chriſtian courſe, as being hereby at libertie from ſuch bondage to our luſts; according to that which is written: <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. Reſiſt the diuell and he ſhall flie. And in this eſtate we haue pleaſed our ſelues moſt commonly,<note place="margin">A cauſe of the former cauſe.</note> becauſe we haue ſought eaſe to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the fleſh, and haue bene loath to take ſuch paines, as to abridge and cut off our manifold vaine delights and fleſhly liberties.</p>
                  <p>Oh, it hath bene a death to vs, when we muſt be rowzed out of our luskiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and be enforced to graunt, that ſuch a life hath bene but meere ſecurity: when we muſt confeſſe much againſt our ſelues (which hardly we haue bene brought vnto;) and yet not reſt there, till we haue alſo obtained of our ſelues to caſt it vp as an vnſauourie gorge. For when in our decay in grace we haue feared ſecretly, that all hath not bene well with vs; and yet for all that, becauſe we would feele no ſmart, and it was irkeſome and tedious to vs, to thinke that we muſt enter into a ſtreighter courſe: we haue lyen ſtill in it as long as we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> could or durſt:<note place="margin">Prou. 1.32.</note> ſo truly is it ſaid, That eaſe is a ſweet poyſon and ſlayeth.

This eaſe it was which would haue ſlaine our ſoules, and was the cauſe of our ſo great looſeneſſe. An eſtate of life full of daunger, and full of deceiptfulneſſe: with which (yet) none haue euer ſo beſotted themſelues, (being holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> captiues of the diuell at his pleaſure) but they who haue eſcaped the daunger of it, haue as highly reioyced; and, as from a bottomleſſe dungeon, haue kept themſelues with all care, from falling againe into it.</p>
                  <p>Now we falling into this fond eaſe, loathed to take ſuch paines in running <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the race of chriſtianitie, and in labouring to keepe in, our ſelues vnto dutie. When we had bene any time vnexerciſed with croſſes and afflictions it was bitterneſſe to thinke, that againe we muſt come vnder them (ſo litle did we hope for any comfortable or fruitfull vſe of them:) and when we had bene proued with them, for the moſt part we were vncomfortable in them. Wherby it appeared, that whatſoeuer we thought of our ſelues and of our great profiting, that our ſtrength was neuer great, becauſe we were found weake in trials, <hi>Prou.</hi> 24.10. Hitherto it belongeth, that we were ſo vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the vſe of any good meanes: I ſpeake not of the looſe and negligent vſing of them, which was a fruite of this vntowardneſſe, (for that hath bene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſpoken of before) but of our great vnwillingneſſe to breake off our luskiſh and ſottiſh courſe of life. As for example: to priuate prayer vtterly vnapt, when we ſhould yet ſee much neceſſitie of it: as being loath to awake our ſelues out of our ſpirituall ſleepe, and loathing the painefulneſſe of going about it. Againſt publike meetings we felt ſenſible rebelling, as ſeeing that the looſeneſſe and libertie which we delighted in, muſt be made odious to vs, and our ſelues thereby diſquieted: we feared, and were in a iealouſie of our good brethrens companie, by reaſon of an euill conſcience, thinking that we muſt be of one mind with them; and that could not ſtand with our vnſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie liking. And what a ſlauerie is it, that we ſhould bring our ſelues to ſuch a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> point, that we muſt obey our filthie luſtes, and become ſeruants to our vile rebellions? What madneſſe is it, that we ſhould depriue our ſelues of the beſt things, and yet contented to abide ſo ſtill? And by this it may appeare, how many defaults are like to breake out from our liues, when ſuch daungerous eaſe and looſeneſſe haue their harbour in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>And yet another cauſe why ſo litle good hath bene done,<note place="margin">The third cauſe</note> we may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to haue bene, that we haue looked ſo narrowly to the liues of others, to gather hurt thereby; not remembring that we ſhould follow none further then they follow Chriſt: of which, ſome being of the better ſort, and others of the common, we haue taken exceeding great hurt by them both. For theſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> latter, when we ſee how they haue many times continuance in outward peace and proſperitie, ſo that they are merrie, and take no thought about prouiding for the iudgement day, neither are withholden from any intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancie of liuing; though we become not like vnto them, yet as men not ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwading our ſelues of their miſerie,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.12.13.</note> we begin to thinke that it is but vain for vs, to labor greatly after innocencie, &amp; to ſhine as lights, which (we ſee) is litle regarded. And ſo we grow to iuſtifie our owne courſe of life, as very ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb facs="tcp:16851:257"/>
and well liking to the Lord: yea and beſides this, we gather ſome rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and ſcurfe from them, by beholding, by dealing, and being too conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with them. And if of theſe, ſome be leſſe euill then others, and retaine ſome points of honeſtie, and of better behauiour in them; yet what a groſſe bewitching of our ſelues is it, to compare our ſelues with thoſe, of whoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe we haue no perſwaſion? Now as the liues of this bad ſort of men are laid too neare vs, &amp; we may ſee that we are weakened in our courſe by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo the liues of the firſt ſort, euen right good men, we either litle or not at all doe profite by; or (that which more is) we many times take hurt by them.</p>
                  <p>For as concerning their beſt actions and moſt commendable duties, we do not vſe to haue them in reuerent admiration, eſpecially if the perſons be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> daily amongſt vs: but we count them common things, and meeter for them then for vs. Yea and we thinke, that we haue ſome other gifts and parts of our liues comparable to them: ſo that we can be content to go without thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to loſe the benefite of ſuch good examples: which yet for this cauſe God ſetteth vp as lights amongſt vs: that we might neuer pleaſe our ſelues in our liues, till we had wonne this at our owne hands, To frame our ſelues after their examples, which are moſt gracious and godly amongſt vs. And further, we will not thinke, but that euen ſuch men haue alſo manifold infirmities in them; though we know them not. But if we do, it is enough to perſwade vs, that euen then when many things ought iuſtly to be remoued out of vs, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> we are to be well thought of, and to be accounted commendable.</p>
                  <p>And theſe are the ſpeciall cauſes, that ſo iuſtly much fault may be found in our liues;<note place="margin">The fourth cauſe, which is compounded of many.</note> vnto the which briefly theſe may be added: that we haue not bene carefull to be ſtraungers to ſuch companies, where we might be eaſily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, or cooled and diſcouraged: neither taken occaſion to be in good companie, or to haue made profite of the ſame when we were in it: but in a common manner ſpent ſuch times, either in endleſſe or needleſſe worldly talke, or ſome other way vnprofitably; rather framing our ſelues to their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and to approue of their euill cuſtome, then bethinking our ſelues how to ſtop them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fifth cauſe hath bene: that we haue not laboured to nouriſh our delight and ioy in the benefite of our redemption:<note place="margin">The fift cauſe.</note> but diminiſhing the price of it, as though it were nothing ſo great and precious as it is commended to be: or ſoone forgetting it, for that it is of ſmall account and litle reckoning in the world; do feede vpon vaine and deceiueable pleaſures: and ſo taking part with the world, do alſo with the world grow vnſeaſoned with grace: and therefore euery ſuch man after his manner becommeth vnprofitable. For when we begin to make a common thing of that aſſurance of our ſaluation, (which without compariſon is the chiefeſt and moſt precious treaſure of all other) and do not maintaine and preſerue the preciouſneſſe of it by all good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> meanes, we muſt needes in ſtead thereof, make account of other vaine reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and ſo the care of godlineſſe waxeth ſmall.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, that we hauing ſometimes felt our ſelues vnfit to be well occupied,<note place="margin">The laſt cauſe.</note> we haue fallen to idleneſſe: and therewith acquainting our ſelues, haue (for the time) neither eſpied it to be a fault, and ſo reſiſted it in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, by miſlike of the ſame; neither haue betaken our ſelues to our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:16851:257"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to the hindering of the ſame; as being miniſters, to attend to reading; or being priuate men, to labour euery man as it hath behoued him.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW foraſmuch as in the weighing of the truth of theſe things, we could not but be grieued heartily: (as who can behold ſo great depth of corruption and the fruite of the ſame, ſo many wayes with deadly vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe threatning his confuſion, but muſt needs ſeeke and vſe all poſſible meanes, ſpeedily to pull himſelfe out again?) we therefore immediatly after the due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our wofull condition, turned our ſelues to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke vs, what remedies we might apply to this fall, if thereby we might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> poſſibly recouer our ſelues againe: and alſo make them helpes for hereafter, that we may as well continue in a fruitfull and cheareful courſe vnto the end of our liues; as at all, to returne into the right way againe. Firſt therefore,<note place="margin">The firſt remedy</note> we thought thus, and tooke order as followeth: that ſuch of vs, as did find our fals to be ſo great, and our offences ſo dangerous, that either for our too too great delight in them, or long lying therein, we could not by our vſuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and humiliation, or by helpe of any ordinarie and daily practiſes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by hearing the word and preparing our ſelues for the Lords ſupper; come to peace of conſcience, and obtaine confidence and godly boldneſſe with the Lord: ſuch (I ſay) ſhould humble our ſelues before the Lord with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> faſting and prayer, without which meanes ſuch diuels are hardly caſt out. Eſpecially, becauſe we had let go the hold of our faith, and had ſuffered the ſame to faile in vs; (which when it commeth to paſſe, what can there be in our life but meere vnſauourineſſe; to ſpeake of the beſt?) our faſting tended to this, that we might more forcibly pray for the recouerie of our faith, and cleare beholding of Gods louing kindneſſe reſtored to vs againe. That in ſuch manner we being abaſed in his preſence (as there is iuſt cauſe that ſuch ſhould be) and beleeuing againe his old accuſtomed mercy, we might in ſome good meaſure be purged from our former vnſauourineſſe, yea noyſome vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and ſo made fit to renue our couenant with the Lord againe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> more holy walking with him. And if we ſhould find, that our hearts might be brought to vnfained diſpleaſure with our ſelues for our former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults, without faſting: then we determined to turne vnto the Lord with all our hearts in ſinceritie, ſo as we might obtaine comfort and releaſe at his handes, as if faſting had bene adioyned thereunto.</p>
               <p>After this, our couenant was to know our hearts better: how euill they are: what falſhood, fickleneſſe, lightneſſe and ſuch like naughtineſſe,<note place="margin">The ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</note> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
<pb facs="tcp:16851:258"/>
of corrupt affections we carie about vs; that thereby we may be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to take more paine to weaken them daily. For we ſaw, that if we be not diligent to ſearch them out,<note place="margin">An euill heart marreth all.</note> as by occaſion we ſhall be moued to do, we ſhall both walke in continuall vnſetledneſſe, and in an vncomfortable eſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can go about nothing, but ſome one of theſe or other ſhall be eſpied to carie vs ſome way amiſſe in the ſame. And thus we purpoſed to note and find them out in vs, by a diligent view of and taking heed vnto our waies, that ſo we may be in daily combate with them. A worthie worke therefore and commendable we ſaw it, to take knowledge of them, and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be blind in the beholding of them (becauſe we are neither eaſily brought to confeſſe and ſee them; and yet that he which hideth them ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> not proſper): that ſo we may behold more filth and venome in them, then we would haue thought could haue bene in vs. And we agreed, that if we ſhold be vnwilling to diſcouer this packe, that euen this willingneſſe to hide them, is one of the moſt daungerous euils among the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now further, becauſe the knowledge of our hearts, (if we ſtay there) I meane,<note place="margin">The third re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</note> of the manifold euill luſts of them, doth make vs the more headie and greedie to fulfill them, when we know them by the lawe of God to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in vs: we haue further faithfully determined to watch ouer them with all diligence, that neither any of thoſe which haue alreadie bene men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, neither any other (as farre as we may know them) may lurke or haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> their abode within vs with our liking, but that we may purge them out: and not thoſe only which are apparently groſſe, but euen ſuch as are more ſecret, being not yet come neare their ripeneſſe: and therefore whereſoeuer we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or in whatſoeuer we haue to do, not to neglect this part of Chriſtian dutie; but eſpecially there and then, where and when we ſuſpect or haue cauſe to feare more danger thereby: as in vehement and ſtrong temptations, and grieuous and long continuing afflictions, there to ſtand the more vpon our watch, &amp;c. So that whether we be in companie or alone, in dealings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad or matters at home, by one occaſion or by other, yet ſtill to haue this purpoſe fixed in vs, that as farre as our fraile memorie will ſuffer vs to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> it, we may go forward in the watching and obſeruing of them. Which muſt the rather be done; becauſe, as the heart is the fountaine of life, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence we haue it, That we liue; ſo from thence we muſt fetch the beginning of well liuing: from an euill and vncleane heart, commeth no part of good life, no more then good fruite from an euill tree. But all the abhomination of the life, euen the moſt odious and vile, (as adulterie, murther, idolatrie, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, &amp;c.) they haue their beginning there, they are conceiued and nouriſhed there, they haue their proceeding from thence; and God is long and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly diſhonoured there for the moſt part, before man by the fruite of it can be or is offended.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
               </p>
               <p>So that as by the Romains law, it was ſtreightly enacted: that their ſprings ſhould be carefully preſerued from all filth which might attaint and poyſon them, that their riuers and water conduits might be ſweet and wholeſome: ſo it muſt neceſſarily be, that the heart of man being once renued and made cleane, it ſhould be kept and continued ſo; that being a good treaſurie, good things may be brought out of it continually of all ſorts, as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:16851:258"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> For here we take it as graunted, that all which ſhall haue their part in this couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or haue already deſired to haue, muſt be renued in their minds, and haue their hearts purged and made cleane by faith in the Sonne of God; whereby their ſinnes may be defaced and all their old conuerſation pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, their ſoules through the ſame with moſt comfortable and ſound peace enlightened; and ſo their hearts purified, both to will and alſo to liue well and godly. Of the which making cleane and purging the heart, as this is no fit place to ſpeake: ſo they muſt haue learned it and haue attained to it who are here mentioned, that is, ſuch as haue couenanted vnfainedly to watch and obſerue the ſame. Therfore (to returne) ſeeing the heart is a deepe dungeon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and pit, full of all vncleane thoughts, and yet deceiuing men; ſo that they ſhal thinke farre otherwiſe, and ſuſpect no ſuch thing (as 1. <hi>King.</hi> 15.8.) ſeeing in all their actions ſome one or other portion of it is readie to corrupt and ſtaine euen the beſt of them, ſo that not the holieſt parts of Gods worſhip can pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and holily be fulfilled without the careful holding in of it: it is worthily and for iuſt cauſe, made one part of this wholeſome remedie of the well ordering of our liues. So that, if any be giuen to ſeeke the libertie which God hath not allowed him, to let looſe his heart after any folly and vanitie, and counteth it too great ſtreightneſſe and preciſe curiouſneſſe to keepe a dominion and a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie ouer it, ſo as he might thereby bring it into ſubiection; he is iuſtly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to be pitied, if he cannot be otherwiſe perſwaded: but if he thinke that way to build vp a godly life, vntill the Lord call backe his word (which now ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for a perfect direction of well liuing) he ſhall neuer attaine to that which he ſeeketh.</p>
               <p>Now this watching ouer the heart, that it may be with the more fruite,<note place="margin">VVith watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there muſt go feare of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending. <hi>2. Cor. 7.2. Deut. 5.29. Pro. 28.14.</hi>
                  </note> muſt haue accompanying it a ſuſpitious and iealous feare, leſt at any time it breake forth into ſuch delights as are worldly, carnall, &amp;c. Of the which feare, for the great good that it doth thoſe who are ledde by it, the wiſe man ſaith: <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes,</hi> that is, his euill heart in one point or other, and therefore taketh the more paine about it. This being ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> farre to be vnderſtood and practiſed, as our weaknes will giue leaue, (i. ſo as we do not willingly nouriſh idleneſſe and vnprofitable liberty and looſneſſe in vs) we are to take view of the fruite which it bringeth vs; and to meaſure by dayes, by weekes, and ſo forward, what eaſe to our conſciences, what chearfulneſſe to our ſoules, and what better fruit in walking in our callings more then we were wont, is reaped of vs and inioyed. And when we ſhall ſee that there is no compariſon betwixt the one and other: that is, betwixt a wandering heart, and betwixt a circumſpect care, we may more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be reſolued to hold out in this courſe ſtill: becauſe although much fooliſh and fleſhly licentiouſnes is forgone, (which is naturally moſt deſired) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> yet it frameth and maketh vs fit for the Lord, &amp; weaneth vs more and more from the world, and is a meane by which with great eaſe and readineſſe wee go on in our Chriſtian courſe. For this is that which we hope for hereby. And there ſhall be no doubt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.14.</note> but when the meditations of our hearts ſhall pleaſe the Lord, that the wordes of our mouthes, and the practiſe of our liues ſhall alſo be acceptable in his ſight. To conclude this point: it is againe to be remembred, that we weane our heart from earthly delights: which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb facs="tcp:16851:259"/>
tickling it with a pleaſant ſweetneſſe, do ſteale it away from heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> things, and hold it here below: and ſo by little and little bring it to find a contentation here, and breed a weariſomneſſe in that godly life. And further, that we be very wary that our hearts be not ſtolne from a liking of good waies, neither brought out of frame by loathing our duties, and ſo depriued of their peace: eſpecially, that we be not hurt nor wounded that way, where there is greateſt cauſe of feare and daunger: nor brought into ſubiection to thoſe ſinnes, to the which by nature we be moſt inclined: as to the loue of the world, vncleannes, breaking off of brotherly affection, &amp;c. And here, if at any time we ſhould be ouertaken, (which is not to be doubted of, no not of the moſt circumſpect and beſt aduiſed) we reſolutely purpoſed not to ſleepe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> nor ſlumber in our ſinne, neither promiſe to our ſelues forgiueneſſe too eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:<note place="margin">Note.</note> but firſt to awake our ſelues, to be amazed that we ſhould let go the ſtrength and hold which once we had; to rebuke and checke our ſelues ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, till ſhame and ſorow for ſo offending, may humble vs: and then we may be bold to aſſure our ſoules, hauing an aduocate with the father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous, that we are receiued of him againe.</p>

And contrarily, to be carefull to continue with diligence and delight, not onely the exerciſe and vſe of ſuch holy meanes of meditation and prayer, as well by our ſelues as with others alſo, reading, hearing and conference, &amp;c. but alſo with minds to reape fruite by the ſame: which is not alwayes intended, nor ſought for ſo oft as the things themſelues are vſed. As for example: ſeeing the readieſt and beſt way to nouriſh and continue this holy deſire, and carefull watching ouer our hearts, is increaſe of knowledge, by the helpe of hearing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> (for zealous and holy affections are like a flame of fire, which without the adding and putting to of wood, as new matter, will ſoone be quenched and extinguiſhed; ſo will our looking to our hearts, and obſeruing of them, be looſely and lightly continued:) it is our purpoſe to ſtir vp our ſelues with more earneſtneſſe hereunto, becauſe we know that we ſhall otherwiſe fruſtrate and make vaine our whole couenant.</p>
               <p>That is to ſay, as foloweth: We do acknowledge, that our negligence and vnreuerence in theſe, haue ſo greatly depriued vs of fruite in vnderſtanding and iudgement, as well as other wayes, that before our hearing we truſt we ſhall prepare our harts by caſting off that which would hinder vs: namely, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> gainſaying the truth, ſecurity, hardneſſe, worldly affections, &amp;c. that with meekneſſe and teachableneſſe, we will bring honeſt and good hearts to the hearing of the word; &amp; in the action it ſelfe, be attentiue, and marking that which ſhall be taught, ſo as it may worke in vs, and raiſe vp anſwerable affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to that which we ſhall heare; as ioy by comfortable doctrine, feare by that which moueth fear, &amp;c. &amp; after we haue heard, we wil beware that it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh

And when we ſhall haue learned to put in vre this part of the remedy, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to marke how this with the former doth bring our minds better in frame: that we may both take incouragement (in beholding any fruit) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it; and in ſeeing the contrary, to marke where the fault lieth, that it may be remoued.</p>
               <p>And to ſharpen our deſire to heare and reade the more willingly, ſeeing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> there is much vntowardneſſe in our nature to ſuch exerciſes, and we haue ſtrong temptations to perſwade vs that it is as needleſſe, as we feele it irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: we haue ſeene it neceſſary for vs to ſtirre vp our dulneſſe, not onely by the commaundement of God, that we ſhould ſearch the Scriptures, (and ſo, reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) &amp; that we ſhold giue eare daily to the Apoſtles doctrine, (and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heare the ſame in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, that by both, the word of God may dwell plentifully in vs;) but alſo to haue in freſh memory the power of the Scriptures: which, beſides that they are able to ſaue our ſoules, ſo they can fill vs with goodneſſe and comfort euery way, as we ſhall haue need, and haue done ſo often in times paſt vnto vs. For many times we haue bene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> brought ſo low in feeling of any preſent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort; to ſuch a barrenneſſe &amp; emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of all good inſtructions; ſometime (which was worſt of all) to ſuch an vnſauourineſſe in the good things of Gods word, and ſo vnapt and vntoward to them; that we thought in our weakneſſe it would neuer be otherwiſe with vs: yet when we haue come againe to the miniſterie of the word, the Lord hath ſcattered our darkneſſe, raiſed vs out of our deceiueable dumpes and drowſineſſe, and ſhewed vs ioy and comfort againe: ſo that we haue bene taught thereby, that this is the fountaine which refreſheth vs in our vnſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thirſts, and cooleth the heate of our ſinne; and finally, giueth greater grace, then Sathan for all his ſubtilties and tyranny.</p>

Many outward diſcouragements alſo and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances will be readie here to ſtand in our way; as houſhold troubles, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe by them, diſorder in ſeruants and children, vntowardneſſe and ill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſucceſſe in buſineſſe, want of bleſſing ſomtimes where it was hoped for, loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp;c. alſo much toyling &amp; occupying our ſelues about theſe things below, with neglect of our heauenly and chriſtian calling.

                  <note place="margin">An admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that this dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left off, nor vſed for cuſtome onely.</note>After this, we ſaid: that if we with diligence continue it, we muſt beware we make not a common thing of it; ſo as, though we vſe it, yet no fruite nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> bleſſing returne to vs by it. The which as it falleth out moſt vſually in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good things, ſo in this the beſt of others, it is moſt to be feared. In the firſt ſetting vpon many duties ſome chearefulneſſe may be ſeene in vs, and ſome time and trauell beſtowed: but alas, within a very ſhort time, we grow full of them: they become irkeſome and tedious to vs; and though we do not vtterly breake them off, yet we may perceiue, that without any great ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and delight we go about them. The reaſon hereof is, that our fleſhly hearts can like of no good thing long. If therefore either of theſe two wayes, we depriue our ſelues of the benefite of growing forward by theſe forenamed remedies: that is, by the negligent vſing of them, or the leauing off of them; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> yet the fault muſt be quickly eſpied, and not long lyen in: for that is more dangerous, then can eaſily be beleeued.</p>
               <p>To the better attaining hereof, we may vnderſtand, that we may grow to a commonneſſe in a good thing two wayes: either when we be in proſperity; in which eſtate, it will be very hard to ſee our great need to vſe feruencie and zeale in holy duties and ſeruices of God, when we ſee varietie of earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:16851:261"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſet before vs to enioy; and we without controulement of any perſon, may take our fill of them. Therefore if in this eſtate, we perceiue any loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſſe of well doing to grow vpon vs, we muſt charge our ſelues with fickleneſſe, inconſtancie, falſhood againſt God, ſecret diſſembling, vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, &amp;c. If we ſhould be content thus to fall from the Lord; and if we be not readie without contradiction to ſtirre vp our ſelues to a fruitefull and chearefull vſe of chriſtian meanes againe; yea, if we be the worſe for Gods benefites: we muſt looke that he wil take them from vs, and cauſe vs to yeeld him other manner of fruites by the want of them. Alſo we muſt here call to mind, whiles with delight we ſerued the Lord, what comfort and godly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> boldneſſe with him we found: which now, if we begin to decline from him, we can enioy no more, but may looke for ſome ſuch recompence as ſhall be meete for reuolters: yea and we muſt tell this (we ſaid) to our owne hearts without flatterie, that if we waxe wearie of the Lord at our pleaſure, it is to be feared, and that iuſtly, that he will ſhake vs off in our feare and neceſſitie, &amp; we ſhall not dare to ſet vpon this chriſtian care again, if once we be glutted with it; and though we do, yet ſhall we not find it eaſie for vs to go forward, although we ſet vpon it againe, but that one time or other we ſhall be like to be driuen backe: which iudgement is fearefull aboue many, and next vnto deſpaire. We muſt thinke that the Lord dealeth tenderly with vs, if we may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> haue libertie to glorifie him by manifold encouragements, in outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: whereas many haue thought it a ſingular priuiledge and great kindnes of his towards them, that they may do it in impriſonment, in bonds, in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, in reproch, &amp;c. And generally, we ought to thinke, that if we thus vſe his benefites, that we grow more vndutifull towards him then many which want them, it is time for him (as hath bene ſaid) to take them from vs, and to beſtow them vpon ſuch as will yeeld and render vnto him better fruite of them. And if this ſhould be any occaſion of licentiouſneſſe to vs, that many, yea, the moſt of ſuch as haue a great portion in earthly commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, do delight in them, and take them not to be giuen them of God to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> end that they ſhould liue more holily, or be the fruitfuller in chriſtian duties by them: we muſt anſwer to our ſelues thus againe, that we neuer were taught it of God, to follow examples, no not of the beſt men, contrarie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe rules of Scripture; much leſſe, the euill examples of the multitude, and common ſort of ſuch as reiect all Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now though we fall not this way by meanes of our proſperitie, (for that were very groſſe) yet if we ſhould more couertly deceiue our ſelues by thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus, that we haue ſufficiently profited by this direction now, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may ceaſe; and neglecting to ſee our wants, daungers, infirmities and diſcouragements which are in our way (as in time paſt) and ſo caſt off this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> againſt theſe deceiuings of our hearts, we muſt reſolutely be perſwaded of the manifold perils outward and inward, which are in our liues; which full ſoone (if we grow cold and remiſſe in a godly life) do begin to take hold of vs: &amp; therfore to keepe our ſelues well whiles we be well. And thus we muſt vſe our ſelues, as hath now bene ſet downe, that we may not vſe the practiſes of godlineſſe after a common manner. But many, whiles the Lord reacheth foorth encouragements to them, and filleth their liues with outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:16851:262"/>
do accuſtome themſelues to ſome commendable courſe: who when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> God chaungeth their proſperous eſtate, do immediately chaunge with it; that is to ſay, whiles daungers and great afflictions take hold of their liues, they are ſo diſtreſſed and grieued for them, that they grow froward, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and diſquieted thereby, and are vtterly vnfit to continue ſuch godly meanes as before they vſed, for the growing forward in a godly life. Hereby is great daunger to be feared: therefore if poſſibly by any of Gods chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we ſhold fall thus farre; yet we muſt confeſſe ſuch ſlippes with griefe, and with ſhame and aſtoniſhment behold our falles, and ſettle no peace in our hearts, till we haue returned and recouered our ſtrength againe, and ſo returne to our firſt eſtate againe: which alſo moſt certainely we ſhall, if with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the ſeruants of God in all ages (as the Iſraelites, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Heſter</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docheus, Heſter.</hi> 4. <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 20. and others) we confeſſe our ſinnes with melting and broken hearts, yea our particular ſinnes of murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, impatience, fretting and ſuch like; that ſo we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of our heauenly father for his Chriſts ſake, to mercie and forgiueneſſe.</p>

Cor. 5.1.</note> in his militant church heere) and haue an houſe not made with hands, but eternall, in his triumphant heereafter? who doeth not ſee, as the former ages haue found and felt, and they who yet remaine on earth ſhall finde, that to all other things, euen the beſt, there is an appointed end? And therefore the ioy that men conceiue for them, is but flitting and momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, not vnſpeakable and euerlaſting. So that the peace and ioy which ariſe from the certeinty of our ſaluation, is woorthely rekoned as a ſingular pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, in as much, as it doeth not onely exceed all worldly treaſures; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> alſo, becauſe it is proper to the children of God,<note place="margin">Reu. 14.3.</note> and the other haue no part in it.</p>
               <p>And further, this ſhould better appeare,<note place="margin">This priuiledge is the greater by conſidering the woe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, who want this.</note> how great a priuiledge it is to be beloued of God, if we could poſſibly conceiue the dreadfull feare of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate in deſperation, and how little comfort ſuch an one taketh in all his wealth and delights which he hath in this world (in whatſoeuer price and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they are with fooles:) but would giue them all for one quarter of an houres feeling of Gods louing kindneſſe and ſweet countenance towards him, if it could be inioied, and the ſound peace and comfort that commeth with it. And therefore if any will know the benefit and greatneſſe of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> let him aske of them, who hauing hardned their hearts through vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, are growne into deſpaire: who with weariſome ſighes and groanes, that cannot be expreſſed, doe thinke with themſelues and ſpeake many times: Oh how happy are thoſe which are ſaued? yea, and what would they giue, if they had it, how many thouſand worlds, for a part in Gods kingdome? Or if the damned ſoules in hell could ſpeake, they would tell you, whether this be a prerogatiue, to be kept ſo ſafely from the torments thereof, and honoured
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:16851:265"/>
with the aſſurance of heauen and happineſſe; as partly may be gathered by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> writeth of the Epicure in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Luc. 16.24.</note> ſaying: Oh that the tippe of a finger were dipped in water to coole my tongue; for I am tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in this flame.<note place="margin">For want of the ioy of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, the vaine delights of the world are hunted after. This priuiledge is yet greater, ſeeing it may be inioyed dayly and to our end.</note> And without it, (I meane, where this is not inioied) I doe maruell, that vaine, deceiueable and tranſitorie, yea loathſome and filthy pleaſures are ſo hunted after, as they be: euen till they iuſtle out all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and regard of heauenly things altogether. And this ſweet liberty peculiar to Gods children, which I now ſpeake of, is ſo much the greater by this, that we may inioy it all the day long, and ſo throughout our life, and are not ſtinted nor tied to one houre or time wherein we may poſſeſſe it: and alſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> becauſe the longer time we be partakers of it, the ſweeter it is vnto vs, ſeeing we doe the better know the benefit of it, and that none hath power to depriue vs of it. And thus much of the firſt priuiledge; namely, The certeintie of our ſaluation, whiles we are in this life: which, if we weigh throughly what we haue beene and what we haue deſerued, will (I thinke) be thought no ſmall nor meane gift, but great and woonderfull, and yet proper to the beleeuers: ſo that all people which ſhall vnderſtand it, may woorthily and for good cauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Chriſtians life, to the which it properly perteineth, and wiſh and trauell to imbrace and be partakers of it moſt willingly; euen as we read, that in ages paſt it was ſaid by the Lord, that ten men out of all languages of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> nations, ſhall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Iew, and ſay: We will goe with you, for we haue heard that God is with you, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.23. And if there were no other priuiledge, but this one to be inioied, whiles we liue heere; yet were our porcion exceeding great, ſeeing ſo many thouſands who heare of it would thinke their eſtate right happy and good, if after many yeeres paine and heauineſſe in ſeeking it, they might inioy it.</p>
               <p>But, glory be to God on high, theſe are not all the precious benefits and prerogatiues, which God hath willingly bequeathed his ſeruants, beſides all other outward bleſſings which they haue in common with the vnbeleeuers. Of theſe therefore, or ſome of them, which either they doe, or may enioy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> daily in the ſeuerall actions and parts of their liues, to make the ſame well pleaſing to God, acceptable to men, and more eaſie and ſweet to themſelues then the moſt doe finde them; of theſe (I ſay) it followeth next to ſay ſome thing.</p>

               <p>I graunt, that all gods children inioy not this, neither ſay I any ſuch thing: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> but this I ſay and affirme freely, that to every age in Chriſt, both the weake,<note place="margin">Why they inioy not this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly.</note> the ſtrong and the middle age, there is more granted by God, then is inioied of them: not that God doth in words ſeeme to offer that,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which he meaneth not to performe, but becauſe men either know not, or beleeue not through ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans malice, what their liberties are: or if they doe,<note place="margin">Men not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or but faintly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, depriue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of much comfort that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly enioy.</note> yet it is ſo faintly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that they are holden backe by euery occaſion almoſt, to forgoe and be diſpoſſeſſed of them. Which all muſt grant to be through their owne fault, which may eaſily appeare to him who is willing to ſee it, thus: whereas the ſpirituall riches, which beautifie the ſoule, are the greateſt riches, and therefore ſhould moſt be ſought after, eſteemed and delighted in: many euen of good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> hope, which will grant this with vs, will not yet beſtow any more trauell for the ſame (be they neuer ſo great priuiledges which god offereth them) then they did in times paſt; that is, with leſſe delight and feruency, then they ſhew in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and looking after their earthly commodities.

               <p>And this in few words is the chiefe cauſe, why not only earthly minded men attaine to nothing, but euen ſome ſuch as haue receiued the firſt fruites of the ſpirit, grow not to any great experience what the excellent eſtate of a chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is, and how great priuiledges God granteth many of them to inioy.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt that it may better appeare how great this priuiledge is, (and ſo I may proceed vnto the reſt) let vs further heare, what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and ſingular fruits doe flow from this fatherly eare and moſt louing prouidence of God ouer his, and accompany the ſame thorowout their liues; which though they ariſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the former, yet I will ſet them downe as particular priuiledges diſtinctly by themſelues. And becauſe it is not ſo eaſily ſeene and conceiued of many, much leſſe beleeued, I will more particularly lay forth the ſame: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> firſt this third; the ſumme whereof is this, that who ſo are thus cared for of God, he beſtoweth this grace vpon them, that they learne of him that which none can learne elſewhere, nor any but his choſen ones can learne, that is how to liue, and goe through their whole pilgrimage according to his will; and how to die, and goe from this vale of miſeſy, that they may afterwards be taken vp into glory: euen this prerogatiue he granteth them. And it hath theſe
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:16851:267"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> two branches: the one, that they may be fruitfull in good life; the other, that they may be kept from foule offences.<note place="margin">The firſt branch of it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning the firſt; namely, the holy life which God teacheth them to lead, this is not the leaſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They haue grac to liue well.</hi> Mat. 11.29. 2 Pet 1.8. 1.

Now that they may be able to doe this, to be ſetled conſtantly in a godly courſe, and wiſe to preuent and auoide the hinderances <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that lie in their way, and to aime at the commandements of God as at a marke, that they may keepe them: is not this a benefit,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119.1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Pſ. 1.2.</note> yea a ſingular priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when the prophet calleth him an happy man that is inabled of God thereto? and Chriſt himſelfe teacheth, that it is the chiefe happineſſe which can be inioied in this life, to keepe the word of God which we heare,<note place="margin">Luc. 11.28.</note> that it may direct &amp; guide vs? yea, that one day in his houſe,<note place="margin">Pſ. 84.2.</note> that is ſpent and paſſed in the militant church and as his ſeruants doe, is better then a thouſand in any eſtate beſides?</p>
               <p>And although it be an eſtate full of happineſſe, yet let no man maruel that I ſay Gods beloued ones may haue this liberty and prerogatiue to walke and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> liue in it:<note place="margin">Phil. 4.13.</note> for the Lord inableth them thereunto by whoſe power they can doe all things; he giueth them an heart not defiled and vncleane,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.27. <hi>The reaſon.</hi>
                  </note> as it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, but purged and clenſed in good ſort, and therefore now it is able to like and loue his will which ſometime it loathed: and they who beleeue and are perſwaded, that God will beſtow and doth daily offer this grace of ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto them, they receiue it, and thereby are ſtrengthened to doe that good in their life, which they can loue with their heart, and which they approoue of and allow in their iudgement.</p>
               <p>Now if this liberty of Gods ſeruants be not either knowen of ſome good Chriſtians, or not beleeued,<note place="margin">Why ſome good people inioy not this. <hi>Pſ. 77.7.</hi>
                  </note> I deny not but euen they (as yet) may goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this priuiledge in great part, accordingly as we may ſee in many. But this need not be, if they knew and were perſwaded of Gods liberality and bounty towards them, as ſome others are, who is ſo farre from denying grace hereto, that he hath pleaſure to ſee them vſe it well to whome he granteth it. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this be, that they draw by faith daily ſtrength from Ieſus Chriſt to ſubdue their luſts, they cannot obtaine to finde the Chriſtian life eaſie to them, as ſome others doe, but goe to worke by their owne ſtrength in all their duties, and by the vertue of their praiers hoping to preuaile againſt their ſinnes; which indeed are not conquered by any ſuch meanes, but remaine in their old ſtrength ſtill: the which they ſeeing, that for all their labouring and ſtriuing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> againſt them, yet they doe not finde that they are weakened or abated in them, but that although they toile themſelues much, yet they profit little; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be diſcouraged and faint, euen in vſing the meanes which they did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding how they ſticke faſt ſtill in the mire wherein before they lay: and ſo they being diſcouraged, fall into ſome great ſorow, or which is little differing, breake out into ſecurity and looſeneſſe.

<pb n="504" facs="tcp:16851:268"/>
to beleeue the promiſe of God, (which is, that he will ſtrengthen them againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> their ſpeciall infirmities) doth play the Lion, holding them vnder with vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe.</p>
               <p>Againſt the which their remedy muſt be this, that they reſiſt ſtedfaſt in faith:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.7.</note> that is, that they yeeld not to this diſtruſt, which long hath oppreſſed them, but by little and little ſuffer themſelues to be perſwaded that their caſe is farre better then they conceiue (which ſhall neuer be hard to perſwade them:<note place="margin">God hath not taken care of his, to leaue them in the midway. <hi>Ioh. 14.18.</hi>
                  </note> who found true deliuerance from the ſpirit of bondage) and that the Lord hath not taken them into his fauour to leaue them at ſix and ſeuen (as they ſay) in the world, and to make them ſhift for themſelues as orphans, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to truſt to their owne wiſdome and ſtrength to preſerue them from ſathan and ſinne: but that he as a father caring for them, hath ſufficient power in his hand to ſtrengthen them, and requireth this of them, that they ſhould beleeue it: which they cannot doe but thereby they are mightily ſtaied and vpholden,<note place="margin">The beleeuer ſhall be ſet at libertie from his ſpeciallest ſinnes.</note> and by the ſame faith ſhall more and more be vpholden daily; vntill they ſee themſelues ſet at great liberty, and that it was the diuill who before held them in feare and bondage.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obiection.</note>The common obiection will heere be put foorth vnto me: that they would (if they durſt be ſo bolde) beleeue with all their hearts, that God will ſubdue and ſlea their ſinne and lead them forward to liue godly, if they could firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſome particular ſinnes which doe moſt trouble them: but as long as they preuaile in them they dare not thinke (they ſay) that God will giue them that grace,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> which he doth vnto others.

I conclude therefore, that Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> children (who pardoneth their infirmities through Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſ. 130.3.4.</note> and will not looke ſtreightly vpon them) haue this prerogatiue, that they may lead their liues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him:<note place="margin">What the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is that he may and ought to attaine vnto.</note> and if they be carefull to know, what liberty he hath giuen them whereby they may obtaine ableneſſe thereto, they may walke woorthy the Goſpell indeauouring to pleaſe him in all things, and ſo to be vnrebuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the middeſt of a wicked and froward generation; although (as I haue ſaid) through the deuils tirannie and the vnbeliefe of their owne hearts, many euen of them, are farre from inioying this priuiledge.</p>
               <p>The which, as it is accompanied with happineſſe it ſelfe, ſo that it may be ſeene to be a priuiledge indeed peculiar to them, know we, that as for other it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> ſhall not neither can be ſo with them; they haue no part in this treaſure, no not euen they,<note place="margin">No wicked man can liue godly.</note> which at ſometimes will ſeeme more holy then the reſt. The wicked (I ſay) haue no fitneſſe nor aptneſſe to receiue this grace [To liue godly] no more then a dead man is fit to riſe againe and walke, or the blacke Moore by waſhing to change his blacke skin. And therfore although they like well enough of the name of it, yet that they are ſuch as deny the power of it,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:16851:268"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> heereby it may appeere, that as the worſt ſort of them like dogges and ſwine tread it vnder feete and ſcoffe at it; the common ſort count it and tearme it preciſeneſſe, and loue to be conuerſant with thoſe that are of their owne mindes: ſo the beſt ſort of them are ſuch as finde in themſelues and know, that they haue no pleaſure in it. No better is the patched life of the beſt ſort of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who liue not by faith, but pleaſe themſelues in this, that their works are good if they doe the outward works which God and their church commend.

               <p>

And as the godly way is become eaſie to them and daily regarded of them, after that it once waxeth pleaſant to them: euen ſo their old delights, I meane the luſts of their ignorance, grow loathſome, which they once thought impoſſible.

               <p>But this which I haue ſaid of the remainder of ſinne and of rebellion of nature abiding ſtill in the beſt of Gods ſeruants, I would haue well to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, for that many will be ready to take occaſion otherwiſe to cauill and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> againſt that which I haue ſaid, namely, that God hath giuen this priuiledge and liberty to ſerue him with delight.<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> For thus they reaſon: If you can goe forward thus eaſily in a Chriſtian life that you can take pleaſure in it, which to ſo many Godly people is toile, it ſeemeth that you are not hindered, nor clogged with the rebellion of the old man, which is our corrupt nature, but that his force and ſtrength is extinguiſhed and killed: whereas the ſcriptures tell vs farre otherwiſe;<note place="margin">Pſ. 51.5.

For as we ſerue God with delight now, and may (God be glorified) do ſo for the moſt part: ſo we ſhould (but for the ſinne that ſticketh faſt in vs) doe ſo, perfectly and continually without intermiſſion and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.</note> as the heauenly ſpirits do. And as our Sauior Chriſt, ſeeing he could neuer be conuicted of any ſinne when he was heere vpon earth (as his words prooue, <hi>Which of you can accuſe me of ſinne?)</hi> therefore when the Prince of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> world (namely, the Deuill) came, he found nothing in him which he looked for, namely, ſinne: euen ſo ſhould it likewiſe be with vs but for this fountaine of ſpirituall leproſie, whereas now we finde through the vncleanneſſe of our hearts, that there is imperfection and weakneſſe euen in our beſt actions, that I ſay nothing of thoſe which are common.</p>

                  <hi>who ſhall deliuer me from the body of this death?</hi> So that the olde man is not killed, nor his ſtrength extinguiſhed: we ſay no ſuch thing, but abated indeed and weakned much, aſwell as pardoned, through the grace and power which wee receiue dailie from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt by faith.

For is it a ſmall thing to finde pleaſure and the greateſt reioycing, in the ſubduing of our euill hearts, and in the forgoing of our vnlawfull liberties, which other men fight for with tooth and naile, and would count their life worſe than any death except they might inioy them?</p>
               <p>Nay, is it not an high degree of honour, that we may from day to day be admitted to reioyce before the Lord in the duties which we doe, euen all that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we ſhall ſet our hand vnto: when yet others are ſo farre off from it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that they would chuſe to lie in priſon all the daies of their life, rather than they would be thus yoked, as they account of it? O therefore, praiſe the Lord, all ye ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; the Lord I ſay, who doth ſo wonderfull things for his: for in this is that Scripture fulfilled, which ſaith: <hi>Honourable things are reported of thee,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Pſ. 87.3.</note> which thy God hath done for thee, <hi>O thou citie, or people, of God.</hi> And if it were not ſo, that the Lord hath done ſo great good things for his people, how could that be true which is ſaid in another place, of their happie eſtate; that it is better to be a doore-keeper in Gods houſe,<note place="margin">Pſ. 84.11.</note> becauſe we are there in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and vnder his gouernment, than to dwell in the tents of the vngodlie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> whereſoeuer, yea though it were in the palace of Princes?</p>
               <p>If it be further demanded: Where are ſuch as inioy this prerogatiue in their liues?

I meane, that all true Chriſtians may obtaine willingneſſe and cheerefulneſſe in their daily duties doing, and to be much freed from the contrary vntowardneſſe and vnfitneſſe, which is the greateſt let that can ſtand in their way: if (I ſaie) God haue prouided ſo mercifully for his, that they may with delight walke in his waies, ſet themſelues to watch againſt their infirmities, and ſo in their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> common dealings and actions practiſe a godly and innocent life, and that they may doe earthly buſineſſe with heauenly minds,<note place="margin">An vnualuable priuiledge, to forme earthly buſineſſe with: heauenly minds.</note> (which the vnreformed cannot in the leaſt manner attaine vnto) I conclude this priuiledge as the former, that the Lord hath in giuing this gift vnto his children, beſtowed an vnualuable bleſſing and prerogatiue vpon them: and let vs waite for and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it; and when we faile moſt, acknowledge ſuch weakneſſe, that we may find releaſe of it from God: and if any of his finde it not, neither ſee it to be ſo, it is their vnbeleefe which depriueth them of ſuch a treaſure; but when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Gods ſanctuary, they ſhall ſee it farre otherwiſe.</p>

For in that he thought, he could by no other meanes be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> deliuered from thoſe ſo great euils which he ſuffered, but by death; it ſhewed that he did not throughly nor ſufficiently weigh the power and might of God. In that he wiſhed either that he had neuer beene borne, or together with his birth to haue died, it muſt needs be granted, that it was a ſpeech of a man little conſidering what he ſaid; but which had forgotten what great mercies he had receiued, yea what he himſelfe had ſometime vttered (.i. If we haue receiued proſperitie from the Lord, why ſhould we not ſuffer aduerſitie?) in that he
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:16851:272"/>
earneſtly wiſhed deliuerance from his ſuffrings, but asked it not of God, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraied <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> a minde in him ſore troubled. And laſtly, in that he had regard onely to his owne quiet and eaſe, and thought at that time, death to be the finiſher of his ſorrowes; it might haue ſeemed to giue him place among the Epicures (who take their pleaſure whiles they liue, looking for nothing after death) but that he declared himſelfe at other times, to be of a contrary minde. But all theſe (as I haue ſaid) proceeded from mans frailty, as we may afterwards heare <hi>Iob</hi> himſelfe to confeſſe. For who doth not maruell, in that ſo great trouble and anguiſh of his, that he vttered not one word either againſt his wife, or againſt his friends dealing ſo vnwiſely with him, and ſo ſore prouoking him,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> as furious and raging men are wont to doe in ſuch a caſe? So that we ſhould not ſo much maruell,<note place="margin">The weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Iobs affliction conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, argueth his patience to be greater then his impatience.</note> that he could be moued to any impatience at all, being ſtricken downe with ſo many and weighty blowes of ſorrow; as that he could keepe any meaſure therein, that he neither brake out into rage againſt them which ſo vexed him, nor into blaſphemie againſt God (which ſathan labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt eſpecially to haue brought him vnto.) Neither is he to be counted an impatient man, who doth not by and by reſiſt and ouercome all vexations of body and torments of minde, with ſuch ſtrength and conſtancie as were to be wiſhed; but he, who ſo goeth to worke, that the helliſh ſpirit in the end preuaileth ouer him and hath the vpper hand. Therefore, moſt wiſely and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Iam. 5.</note> doth the apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> admoniſh: that in iudging about <hi>Iobs</hi> conflict, we conſider not ſo much, what came to paſſe in the combat and fight, as we marke the end of the battell, that is to ſay, that God did inwardly vphold his ſeruant, and pronounced him an happie man: and though he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to be very grieuouſly tempted, yet neuer beyond his ſtrength, which he in moſt fit time and ſeaſon did ſupport him with. And what one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Saints of God hath not prooued and found this true, if we marke and conſider their words and their liues? Let thus much be granted therefore, that the fleſh raged in <hi>Iob,</hi> and ſo, that he offended grieuouſly; and no maruell, for he was a man: but yet (God himſelfe being iudge of this matter) he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> wholly gaue place to the fleſh: but (although it was not without manie wounds receiued in the battell) yet the ſpirit preuailed, and had the vpper hand in him.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe this is to be ſaid: As the Lord <hi>Ieſus</hi> had done much for him, and giuen him many priuiledges, euen as to other of the Apoſtles he had done; yet in that dangerous plunge of his, being the greateſt downefall (a man would think) that euer any good man might ſuſteine, he neither ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, neither was wholly drawen from his holde, and ſubdued by Sathan.<note place="margin">Peters deniall of Chriſt was onely in word, his heart not conſenting. The cauſes of it were two: Raſhneſſe and feare of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> For although he denied in word, that he knew Chriſt, yea and that with a curſe called for vpon himſelfe, if he knew him; I ſay more, though his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> conſcience did burne within him at the ſame time, yet did not his minde goe with his mouth, neither did he change his iudgement with his ſpeech: but he was brought vnto it, partly by that raſhneſſe of his, which was too readie at hand with him in many of his actions; and partly, by the feare of that danger which was at hand, if he had confeſſed <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But in the meane ſeaſon, that ſpirit which had taught him that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the ſonne of the liuing God; and
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:16851:272"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſo taught it him, that he loued nothing more dearely than his maſter: that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (I ſay) dwelling ſtill in him, was not caried to ſuch outrage, but either was ſilent in him not conſulted withall (as in heady and boiſterous affections it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe;) or els, it ſecretly rebuked the tongue, though no ſuch thing appeared. And ſo likewiſe the faith,<note place="margin">Peters faith neuer loſt.</note> for which <hi>Chriſt</hi> praied that it might not faile nor be ouercome, was not extinct in him, nor vtterly loſt. For if it had beene ſo, he would haue ioyned himſelfe in familiarity with the Iewes, and haue complained, that he had all that while beene deceiued of his maſter: whereas on the other ſide, he went forth and wept bitterly, and declared many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> waies how deeply he was diſpleaſed with himſelfe for that his offence. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet doe I ſpeake this of <hi>Peter,</hi> as though I went about to make his ſinne ſmall and light; which (ſurely) I am perſwaded, did deſerue eternall death a thouſand waies: but that if any haue ſinned of infirmity or in any ſuch maner, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, (and yet, beſides the vnpardonable ſinne, one would thinke that none could be greater) yet that they ſhould not caſt away all hope, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire; but that they ſhould be perſwaded, that the way is open to ſaluation, if they haue the faith and repentance which <hi>Peter</hi> had.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Dauid</hi> and others, the like may be ſaid; but I haue ſtaied too long in theſe examples. I will returne now to the priuiledges and liberties which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſeruants of God haue proper vnto themſelues from other men, that they may not coldly and vnwillingly deſpiſe the world, and cleaue to the Lord without fainting. I truſt, now the hardeſt obiection is anſwered which can be brought againſt their welfare and proſperitie, and that it cannot be taken from them by any ſubtiltie or malice of the adverſarie; as it is written:<note place="margin">Matt. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt them</hi>: and therefore I may be bold to affirme,<note place="margin">Luc. 10.</note> that they hauing their names written in heauen already, and this being teſtified of them by the Lord himſelfe, That they ſhalbe kept ſafe vnto the reſurrection day, &amp; that none ſhall take them out of his hands; that they are in great account with him, and highly eſteemed of him, as was ſaid before. And howſoeuer the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> world thinke and ſpeake of them, becauſe they know them not:<note place="margin">They that are honored of God are moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</note> yet is their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate moſt honourable, becauſe they are honoured of the Almighty, and from the greateſt feare of danger they are deliuered. Is a valiant and noble gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in diſgrace, becauſe (whiles he goeth vnder great perils for his countrey, &amp; hazardeth his life for his Prince, and goeth thorow many hard aduentures) he is reported of to be confederate with the enemie: when yet he is beloued and renowmed (and that for iuſt cauſe) of Prince and Peeres? No more is the ſeruant of God to be reputed vile, and his eſtate contemptible, for that (whiles he goeth about to honour his God, and in his life to expreſſe his exceeding kindneſſe) he is both then and therefore ſet againſt by the deuill and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and by their malice and ſubtiltie drawen into ſome action, which might cauſe ill report and breed a doubt of his godlineſſe, when yet his faithfulneſſe is approoued of the Lord his God. Was <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he was buffited by the meſſenger of Sathan, that is, after great exaltation and glory a little before, now immediatly not only depriued of the feeling of it, but brought to ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie an eſtate, that he was deeply aſhamed to thinke he had beene ſo high; was he therefore depriued of that which yet he was made to hope for? Nay,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:16851:273"/>
therefore the Scripture putteth it out of all doubt, ſaying after: That he trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ouer ſathan in token that he had found nothing in him to ouerthrow him,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.7.8.</note> as he ſaith himſelfe: <hi>I haue fought a good fight, I haue finiſhed my courſe, I haue kept the faith: from henceforth is laid vp for me a crowne of righteousneſſe.</hi> Therefore we ſee, how God keepeth his from ſhamefull euils, while they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he will do ſo, and maketh an holy and Chriſtian life their comfort. And yet all theſe and other ſuch excellent priuiledges which appertaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,<note place="margin">This and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuiledges are no more, then euery Chriſtian hath need of to paſſe through this vale of teares.</note> are no more then God did ſee they ſhould ſtand in need of (as I ſaid in the former priuiledge) to helpe them beare the burden of tribulation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch and other diſcouragements which heere meet with them: which would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſhake them ſo, as they would make them to faint vtterly if they were not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden with props and ſtaies moſt mighty.</p>

And yet I ſpeake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> not this, as though I went about to debar ſuch from imbracing Gods mercy offered them: who I exhort earneſtly, to ſeeke it ſpeedily. But as for the other, there is no iuſt cauſe why they ſhould caſt away their confidence, and doubt or feare that the Lord hath forſaken them, as the moſt of them through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and vnbeleefe doe too readily conceiue and perſwade themſelues. For if any of them ſinne, they haue an Aduocate with the father, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the righteous,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Both which reſpects becauſe they are woorthy to be regarded alwaies in this caſe, and for that an example very fit for this purpoſe commeth to my remembrance, I will in as few words as I can, lay foorth the ſame. In the booke of <hi>Ezra</hi> the prieſt,<note place="margin">Ezra. 10.1.2. &amp;c.</note> we read, that he and many of the people of the captiuitie after their returne home, caſt themſelues downe before the houſe of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Lord, praying and confeſſing their ſinnes with teares in aboundance, and chiefly this ſinne, in that they had taken to themſelues wiues of ſtrangers; which was a grieuous breach of the Lords commandement. <hi>Zechania</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iehiel</hi> a godly man, anſwered and ſaid vnto <hi>Ezra: It is true; we haue committed a moſt heinous and wilfull offence, in ioining our ſelues to ſtrangers, and marying wiues out of them:</hi> but yet, that we caſt not our ſelues into deadly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire,<note place="margin">Two points are principally to be obſerued.</note> (as ſuch a tranſgreſſion of Gods law might eaſily carie vs vnto) let vs know, <hi>that there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing.</hi> Wherein, theſe two points I obſerue principally among many others:<note place="margin">First, Gods mercies are not ſleightly to be ſought for.</note> that as neither <hi>Ezra</hi> who had great knowledge in the law of God, nor <hi>Zechania,</hi> nor the people which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> feared God, durſt in ſuch an offence lightly and in a looſe manner, heale vp their breach of Gods commandement,<note place="margin">Secondly, when God is rightly ſought vnto, there ought to be no doubt of obteining mercy.</note> although they knew that there was hope to be conceiued of pardon; but ſaw cauſe to humble themſelues before God in the confeſſion of their ſinne, and praied for the remiſſion of it with teares, and made a firme couenant to put away their ſtrange wiues: ſo yet, when they ſought vnto God after this holy and hearty manner, then did they

for this trueth and doctrine with all their might, it is becauſe they are not they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> whom they would be taken to be, that is, ſound-hearted.

               <p>And thus (to drawe to an end of this matter) I truſt it doth appeare what a ſingular priuiledge this is, that the Lord graunteth free acceſſe to thoſe, who after their conuerſion haue ſinned any way againſt their conſcience, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile their ſinne before him, and to be perſwaded of forgiueneſſe of the ſame: which being knowen of them, they need not hold backe from him, as manie of his deare children for a long time haue done; but come home againe, and that earely, ſeeing God who hath ſmitten them, will heale them; and he,<note place="margin">Exod. 34.7.</note> who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> hath called himſelfe a God of great compaſſion and mercy, would haue his poore people to feele and inioy it.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll this that hath beene ſaid of theſe foure priuiledges laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, will be graunted in generall to be true I doubt not, for all profeſſors are literall and ſpeculatiue Chriſtians: they ſay, and doe not. But when this doctrine ſhould be brought to vſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of them in particulars, and when they are to be preſſed with the practiſe of it, then many will anſwer: They hope that it doeth not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to them, neither are they able (they ſay) thus to hold ſtedfaſtly the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of gods fauour by faith, and to ſubdue and ouercome their ſinnes, to lead a godly life, nor to riſe vp againe when they haue fallen dangerouſly: (thereby ſhewing, that they doe not looke to be ledde by the word in their actions:) but I go not about to perſwade ſuch, that they haue any part in theſe priuiledges. And they might ſpeake with good reaſon, obiecting thus of all other as well as of themſelues, if God had not appointed and taught them by what helpes and meanes, they may doe this. But therefore we are to know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> that God hath beſtowed this priuiledge vpon his children, ouer and beſide the former, that by ſuch meanes and helpes as he hath acquainted them with,<note place="margin">It is a great priuiledge, to vſe the helpes which God hath giuen to his.</note> and taught them to vſe, they may be able to inioy the foreſaid liberties (which without them, and by their owne ſtrength they can not ſo much as go about) and to preuaile ſo farre by inioying them, that they may finde their liues more ſweet and comfortable, then other can in what eſtate or condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, if they haue not their part in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="520" facs="tcp:16851:276"/>And that it may be ſeene that theſe helpes are priuiledges, (as I haue ſaid)<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> behold it briefely in the particular helpes, and eſpecially ſuch are to be vſed daily;<note place="margin">And namely praier:</note> as for example: What a benefit is it, that by praier we may come vnto our God for whatſoeuer we haue need of that is good for vs, and may obtaine it? that we may come to him, (I ſay) breake our minde, lay open our griefe and commune familiarly with him as with a friend, when we will: he neuer being wearie of vs,<note place="margin">Ioh 15.15.

But this is yet more, that we know how to come before the Lord with confidence and reuerence,<note place="margin">If we know how to pray.</note> ſo as we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> need not doubt but he will heare and regard vs, and ſo to come with delight; when yet praier is counted a cold helpe to men of the world to be vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by.</p>
               <p>Of watchfulneſſe to ſay a little alſo: what a treaſure is this, that whereas the diuill deceiueth thouſands,<note place="margin">Alſo it is a goodly priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be watchfull.</note> they being not wiſe &amp; wary to eſcape his ſleights; yet he teacheth his, farre greater wiſdome and care to take heed to themſelues? for he draweth ſome to whoredome and vncleaneſſe: ſome to vaine and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous expence of the precious time in play and folly: ſome to hunt after the wealth of this world, with pined and hunger ſtarued ſouls: and vndoeth others after ſundry other waies; when yet we may by watchfulneſſe ſhift and ſhunne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> them, and not be taken in the ſnare, as others are; and the oftener that we haue preuailed, we may be the better able to preuaile ſtill for heereafter: and that we thus reſiſting and ouercomming in the greateſt danger, we may much more auoide the ſmaller. But neither our gaine by it, nor their loſſe who are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, is greatly conſidered of them till they haue throughly ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the neglect of it.</p>
               <p>And ſo I may ſay of the viewing of, &amp; looking backe vnto our whole courſe of life in the day,<note place="margin">An other is, to view the day at our lying downe.</note> when we are ready to lie downe at night: What a ſweet liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is this, that whereas the moſt are either ſtung or wounded at night with the remembrance of their euill ſpending of the day or a great part of it, or ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> euill that they haue done in it; or elſe, thinke not of it at al, but digeſt it merily and forget it (which, of the two, is farre more dangerous, as that which ſurfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them:) yet we may by this priuiledge of looking backe to our beſtowing of the day, auoid both the one and the other of theſe daily ſickneſſes; or if we remember any thing to haue eſcaped vs amiſſe, we are ready to bewaile and acknowledge it to our God, and to pray for pardon in faith, and renounce our ſinne: and yet who ſeeth not, that for the moſt part, we may be ſure to finde little to accuſe vs then at our lying downe, or to hinder our ſleepe, becauſe we were watchfull againſt it through the day, while we were awake? The ſame I may ſay of the reſt.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/>
               </p>
               <p>For as he hath promiſed to bleſſe the vſing of theſe helpes, ſo he draweth our hearts to beleeue it that he will doe ſo indeed,<note place="margin">For we beleeue that which God hath promiſed. <hi>Ioſ. 1.3.</hi>
                  </note> and thereby to looke for the accompliſhing of his promiſe euen as certainly, as if it were already perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; as <hi>Ioſua</hi> did in all the Lords battels which he fought for the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, when God had ſaid of the whole land of <hi>Canaan: I haue,</hi> or (which is all one in God) <hi>I will giue it into thy hand</hi>; he beleeuing that he would doe ſo
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:16851:276"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> indeed, was incouraged thereby to fight for it, and to goe againſt their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and make warre with them, in an other maner of proceeding, either in cheerefulneſſe or confidence, then they which came againſt him. And ſo (to ſay the ſame of the particulars) when the Lord ſaid: <hi>I haue giuen</hi> Iericho <hi>and</hi> Ai <hi>into thy hands, the king of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>with his band of other kings and their men of warre, the king of</hi> Haſer <hi>with all the kings and people that came with him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioſ. 11.6.</note> 
                  <hi>whoſe multitude was as the ſande of the ſea ſhore</hi>; what was his munition or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, but his faith? wherein lay his ſtrength but in this, that he beleeued, that the God of heauen and earth was ſtronger then all they; and that he which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> had promiſed, would alſo doe the ſame although he was inuiſible? For the which cauſe, it is written in the ſcriptures,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.30.</note> that by faith the walles of <hi>Iericho</hi> (a thing in reaſon moſt abſurd) yet by faith, and not by battery or ſtrength or pollicy, they fell downe. The ſame I might (but for auoiding tediouſneſſe) ſay of many other; who beleeuing, that God would bleſſe the ſame meanes, which he commanded them to vſe, haue with great courage interpriſed them:<note place="margin">Gen. 6.22. Hebr. 11.17.</note> as <hi>Noah</hi> in making the arke, <hi>Abraham</hi> in offering to kill his ſonne; who if they had not beleeued, that God would bleſſe their indeuours and turne them to their great good, would neuer haue attempted the ſame.</p>
               <p>And thus hauing made this matter plaine by examples, I will now proceed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in applying them to the preſent occaſion. Therefore, as <hi>Ioſua</hi> hauing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes giuen him of God, beleeued them and thereby preuailed againſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſcouragements: ſo Gods ſeruants hauing the like promiſes, are ſtrengthened by God to beleeue them, as he was, and by beleeuing them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that which is promiſed. For God promiſeth,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.4.</note> that by the helpes which he hath giuen, he will inable his people to get victory ouer their ſinnes, to leade a godly life: and when they fall by any infirmity,<note place="margin">Mich. 7.8.</note> not to ſuffer them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to faint and diſpaire of forgiueneſſe, on the one ſide; or to make light of their ſinne and to be careleſſe about it, one the other ſide.<note place="margin">Dan. 9.5. 1. Sam. 12.19.</note> Theſe promiſes therefore whoſoeuer beleeue, they by the helpes which they vſe, obtaine the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> bleſſing, namely the thing that is promiſed. So that it is not the bare vſing of theſe helpes which effecteth, much leſſe meriteth any ſuch fruit or bleſſing; but that they are vſed in faith, and the parties who vſe them, looke conſtantly for bleſſing vpon the ſame, and power and ſtrength from God to helpe their weakeneſſe.</p>
               <p>This was neceſſary for me to ſay, how and in what caſe the meanes and helpes, which we vſe to the conſtant practiſing of a godly life, become effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnto vs; namely, when we beleeue God that he will bleſſe them to vs.<note place="margin">No fruit of the beſt helps, if we vſe them not in faith. <hi>Iam. 1.6.</hi>
                  </note> And indeed otherwiſe, let not men looke to receiue any thing thereby; which the apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> affirming of one eſpecial helpe, namely of praier, is as truly ſaid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of all the reſt: that he which doubteth and wauereth (when he ſhould beleeue) whether by thoſe helpes he ſhall be furthered and bettered or not; let not that man looke to receiue any thing. Therefore we muſt learne to be acquainted with faith, euen as we deſire to be acquainted with God (for by no other meanes can we know him, or haue acceſſe vnto him:) and thereby we receiue power and ſtrength through the helpes which we vſe, to liue well and godly. Theſe helpes what they are, and which ought to be vſed euery day, and which
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:16851:277"/>
by other occaſions, I haue before ſet downe in the third and fourth part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> this treatiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Now, foraſmuch as God hath giuen this liberty, as a ſingular priuiledge to his people, to vſe theſe helpes conſtantly and continually, it is our part to ſee, whether we doe ſo or not;<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.17.</note> or whether we ſuffer our ſelues to be plucked away with the errour of the wicked, and ſo fall from our ſtedfaſtneſſe. For if we finde not our liues, and our whole courſe in all dealings and affaires through the day, to be ſo paſſed as that we haue peace to God-ward throughout, and with peace lie downe at euen, it is our owne ſinne; God hath taught vs, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo prouided how it might haue beene otherwiſe with vs, if we had beene but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> as carefull to finde it, as we were carefull about our liuing and maintenance, or to ſeeke vp a ſtraied beaſt which we had loſt, and to bring it into the paſture againe.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeake more plainely, if we doe not ſo begin the day with thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing,<note place="margin">How the day is to be begun and continued.</note> confeſſion of ſinne, and praier when we may doe it conueniently, and ſo arme our ſelues with the whole armour of a Chriſtian, ſo watch and pray after, ſo vſe Chriſtian exerciſe in family, and remember Gods bounty towards vs; and laſtly ſo looke backe to our paſſing of the day, that we may ſee by all theſe that we haue beene guided by God, and that we haue beene holden in our courſe without any iuſt cauſe to wound our conſcience: then it is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> who hath detained and kept our right from vs, and depriued vs of ſo good a portion as our God hath bequeathed vs, when he ſhewed himſelfe willing to haue had it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>And whither through ignorance, we know not how to be ſafely led through the day; or that which is little better, although we know, yet for ſlougth, or for that we loue darkeneſſe more then light,<note place="margin">What it is to neglect duty, or to commit offences.</note> we let paſſe many knowen duties, or ſuffer ſundry offences to paſſe from vs in the day: it is all one, as if we would ſuffer our ſelues to be depriued of our owne proper inheritance by ſome couſener, who ſhall tell vs that it belongeth not vnto vs, when yet we are able to ſhew cleare and ſufficient euidence for it. For when the Lord ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſay:<note place="margin">Reuel. 3.11.</note> Let no man take away your crowne; then the diuell ſheweth himſelfe manifeſtly in detaining it from vs. And therefore we muſt remember that to vſe theſe helpes rightly,<note place="margin">The ſweeteſt liberties of a Chriſtian are wretched bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to a man of the world.</note> is no bondage nor ſeruitude, as men of the world count them, who ſtraine themſelues and ſtriue mightily to be deliuered from the holy and ſpirituall vſe of them, and not to be tied thereto: we muſt rather be perſwaded, that they are moſt precious liberties, peculiar to gods deereſt ſeruants; and a ſingular benefit of God, that in ſuch a dead world, and frozen age as we liue in, we may be counted meet, and made able to honour our God, (which to moſt men is tedious) and to haue peace with him through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the day; and that we may be taught of him to vſe the helpes thereto, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> others are well content not to be acquainted with.</p>
               <p>And if we be throughly perſwaded of this, that it is a libertie, a benefit, and honour to vs, to hold our mindes willing from day to day to the reuerent vſe of them; and be reſolued, that we haue no worke more needfull to be done of vs any day then this: we ſhall not need to doubt of ſuch fruit heereof, as is not to be repented of; euen ſuch, as will cauſe vs to confeſſe that the meanes and

               <p>For be this knowen to the profaneſt and proudeſt contemner of God,<note place="margin">The beautie of the worſhip of God is too glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for the armeyes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons to beholde.</note> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſeldome, and onely for faſhion doth pray or heare a ſermon, that theſe helps, whereby we grow conſtant in a Chriſtian life, are not of little account becauſe they are ſo with him; but that they are ſo glorious that he is not woorthy of them, nor to reape the profit that commeth by them: his light eſteeming of them cauſeth me to ſet the more by them: his vnſauourineſſe that he findeth in them and wearineſſe of them, cauſeth me to commend them the more highly, and the more to admire the Lords kindneſſe to me, who maketh them ſo ſweet and gainfull to me, which are to him very gall and wormewood.<note place="margin">That which is common to all, is no priuilege.</note> For otherwiſe, how could they properly be called priuiledges, if they were a like precious to good and to bad? or were in as good reckoning with the one,<note place="margin">Note.</note> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with the other? For, the euill ſort are not perſwaded thus of them, therefore they finde nothing. They either know not theſe helps, (which may truely be ſaid of the moſt of them) or if they doe, yet they know not how to vſe them in faith, eſpecially (I may ſay) not conſtantly, one day as another, or one of them aſwel as another, (that it may go better with their ſoules thereby:) but thinke, that though they vſe them not at all, it is no great matter; and if they doe vſe them, though it be but in ceremonie and neuer ſo houerly, then they thinke, that euen for that very cauſe they highly pleaſe God. Which maner of vſing them, is neuer able to proue to them, what fruit and benefit may be reaped by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But we who beleeue in him, may know them, and rightly practiſe them,<note place="margin">Who they are, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the ſeruice of God.</note> (though full weakly at ſome time we do it) and looke for fruit by them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it: and when we ſee what bleſſing he giueth vs therof, (as he doth, and that very great, to the end that we may haue the better experience how manie waies he keepeth promiſe with vs, and how he inricheth vs) then we waxe more conſtant therein, and are the more hardly withdrawen by any occaſions from holding out in the ſame. This (I ſay) we may do, although with griefe it may be ſpoken, that many euen of vs, are too farre off from inioying this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie as we might do. But let all ſuch know, that it is their owne ſinne, who cannot therefore praiſe God for this ſweet helpe, while they be not the better <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> for it. Therefore to ſhut vp this point, let this be perſwaded to all Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruants, that he hath of ſingular fauour giuen the helps which ſettle them in a Chriſtian life, as a great prerogatiue and priuiledge: and therefore, when vnder colour of weakneſſe we yeeld to the waiwardneſſe of our hearts, which are ſoone vntoward to theſe gracious helps, and wearie of them, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of ſuch vnthankfulneſſe, and of the nouriſhing of ſuch fleſhly libertie as ſhaketh off ſo needfull dueties.

               </p>
               <p>Now I would haue proceeded to lay foorth before the Chriſtian Reader an other priuiledge, which in this place would very fitly come in; and that is, that God hath ſurely prouided, that they who are thus farre beautified and bleſſed of him, ſhall thus continue vnto the end: but ſeeing it is the laſt that is inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this life, it ſhall haue the laſt place among the temporall priuiledges.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow the next priuiledge that I thinke may moſt fitly be ioyned with the former, is: how the Lord hath taught his the right vſe of proſperitie and aduerſity, and how they may cary themſelues in peace, and be vpright in both eſtates: two of the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> parts of our life, ſeeing the greateſt part of it doth goe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row them: for the moſt of it is accompanied with bleſſings or chaſticements. The right vſe of both, although in ſome ſort and in generall may be gathered out of the former diſcourſes, and namely, of the third priuiledge: yet becauſe they are diſtinct points, and it is hard to vſe them aright, and as precious as it is hard; I know it is very neceſſarie to make a particular Treatiſe thereof. And firſt, more clearely to ſpeake of the one, I ſay: God hath exceedingly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his mercie and kindneſſe this way to his people, that although proſperitie be a ſlipperie path,<note place="margin">Proſperitie a ſlipperie eſtate.</note> and riches and honour, health and friends, with all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawfull pleaſures, profits and liberties of this life doe deceiue and vndoe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the greateſt part of the world which inioy and poſſeſſe them; yet the beloued of the Lord may be free from this danger,<note place="margin">God teacheth his to ſtand in this ſlipperie way.</note> and ſo directed that they need not be taken in theſe ſnares, nor make them their bane which are giuen them as bleſſings: this grace therefore if any ſhall be found to inioy, they may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely ſaid to be priuiledged aboue other men. Now to proue this, that Gods children may vſe the world rightly (which is impoſſible for any other to doe:<note place="margin">The wicked cannot.</note>) I doe not meane, that becauſe they haue right vnto earthly things through Chriſt, and are heires with him of the bleſſings of the world, that therefore they doe ſoberly and as they ought vſe the ſame; for many euen of them, are (I confeſſe) farre from it, and therefore that which they want I labour to helpe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> them to: but as they are the perſons which may be perſwaded and brought to the right vſe of theſe outward liberties (and not the wicked;) ſo God draweth their hearts thereunto by his mighty power, whereby he is able to doe all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">How he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his to do it.</note>For when he cauſeth this doctrine to be taught them: Of the contempt of the world, of contentation in their eſtate, of moderation and ſobriety in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> pleaſures and profits &amp;c. he imprinteth it in their hearts by the holy ghoſt: he maketh them able to beleeue that it is ſpoken to them,<note place="margin">Firſt by the ſcriptures:</note> and therefore to apply it to themſelues: he maketh them prooue how this doctrine worketh in them, and try themſelues by it, that where they ſee themſelues to haue gone beyond their bounds, they may returne and bring their feet backe into the way of his teſtimonies: he, through the ſame doctrine, ſeaſoneth their hearts, and wholly poſſeſſeth them with the loue of it, that ſo their wants may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and they thereby may grow better practiſed in this ſobriety. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the inioying of earthly commodities be an alluring baite,<note place="margin">Luc. 14.18.19. Dan. 4.27.

And as they grow daily to ſee more cleerely their gaine heereby,<note place="margin">By meditation alſo of their gaine heereby.</note> and that without theſe meditations vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> examples and doctrine of death and mortality, &amp;c. they cannot keepe their heartes freed from infection by the world and earthly dealings: ſo doe they more reſolue with themſelues daily, to thinke of them ſtill; and to purge out their old and accuſtomed delightings in worldly things, their dreames of long life, deſire of eaſe, and increaſe of earthly commodities: with all which the diuill ſtuffeth and filleth their braines, that while they begin to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer to theſe, they may be perſwaded ſtrongly that there is no other happineſſe to be attained vnto; and ſo therby, deſtruction may ſuddenly come vpon them.</p>
               <p>Thus (I ſay) the Lord frameth his, to the contempt of the world,<note place="margin">The effect heereof.</note> and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> temperance and contentation, to deſire no more then their moſt wiſe &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident father thinketh meet for them, nor no longer to inioy any of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall liberties, then he ſhall ſee it to be expedient. Thus he teacheth them both in wanting, to thinke themſelues (yet) neuertheleſſe beloued of God; and in the inioying of aboundance, not to thinke themſelues the better for it nor to be proud of it: I ſay, he teacheth them; for neither bring they this grace with them from their cradle, but learne it; and ſtudy how to learne it ſo, as they may practiſe it: and yet they learne it not by their owne wiſdome, but by God, who is onely able to teach it them: who by the meanes that I haue ſhewed, doth bring to paſſe, that they ſo buy, as if they poſſeſſed not; and ſo vſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the world, as that they abuſe it not; ſo vſe mariage, as they are not hurt nor hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from godly life by it, more then if they were vnmaried, but much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and helped by it, neither neglect they thereby the caring for the things of the lord: but as two are better then one, ſo finde they (as God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) much helpe thereby vnto euery good worke. Neither, though they haue much in the world, do they therfore loue it much; but are glad to follow holy <hi>Iob</hi> in that, when he ſaid: <hi>If I haue made gold my hope,</hi>

               <p>But when all this is ſaid, me thinkes I heare diuers to obiect thus: We doubt nothing of the trueth of all this, but that there haue beene ſuch mentioned in the Scriptures: but what is that to vs? where are they in this our age who may be brought foorth for ſuch examples? I ſay, if the men could not eaſilie be found, yet that hindreth not the doctrine to be true: but further I ſay as the trueth ſaith, <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 1.5. As God hath done to others, ſo he will doe to vs; and his goodneſſe is not abated towards vs, more then it was in the ages paſt: yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Eſa. 59.1.</note> we haue more neere acquaintance with the will and minde of God, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> many of them who are highly commended in the Scriptures; and in this latter age,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.11. Act. 2.17.18.</note> God hath viſited his people in a moſt gracious maner, beſtowing his gifts and powring out the graces of his ſpirit vpon them aboundantly. All which laid together, what can be gathered leſſe then this, that when his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren heare by the preaching of his word,<note place="margin">Note.</note> all things vnder the ſunne to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie, vaine and ſoone flitting away, and themſelues alſo with them daily drawing vnto an end, riches vncertaine, beautie deceitfull, health euer chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, friends alwaies dying, &amp;c. but that he cauſeth them to beleeue it, and therefore not to reſt vpon them?<note place="margin">It is moſt falſe that ſome ſay: My goods are mine owne, and therefore I may do with them as I lift.</note> So when they heare, that they may not vſe them as they liſt, (no not the lawfulleſt of their liberties, as poſſeſſions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> friends, time, &amp;c.) that is, to pride, wantonneſſe, idleneſſe, exceſſe, the wronging and hurting of others, but as helpes to themſelues and many others vnto godlineſſe; they are glad to heare their ſhepheards voice, and they know it and beleeue it and follow it, vſing theſe lawfull benefits of God accordingly: I ſay, when they know by Gods word, how they may vſe them which ſometime they did not know, and that God giueth ſuch grace to his, (and cauſeth the ſame to be publiſhed and preached) whereby they may be able to vſe all theſe outward bleſſings of God to their right ends, and ſo, as they become not baits and ſnares vnto them; they reioice and beleeue the ſame with thankfull hearts, and ſo are made able to doe the ſame, vſing their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> praiers and watch with their other helpes, to practiſe this point of godlineſſe (namely, moderation and the true vſe of their lawfull liberties) as they inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour after all the reſt.</p>

<pb n="527" facs="tcp:16851:279"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> there is no ſtronger diſmaier of them, then when they ſet vpon either this, or any other part of Gods ſeruice by their owne ſtrength; that is, not knowing whether they may be bolde to beleeue and be perſwaded, that the Lord will giue them power and harten them vnto the right performance of it, (for of that point the moſt of Gods poore children are ignorant or not ſetled in faith about it) and therefore they doubt and feare, that they ſhall neuer come neere or attaine to that which they ſeeke: by occaſion of which weakneſſe, the diuell holdeth them in great diſcomfort; that although they would doe the will of God in that which they goe about, yet they ſtande at a ſtay, and are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> holden vnder many heauy diſcouragements for a long time. And yet are theſe farre more faithfull and ſimple hearted, howſoeuer they are feared by their owne weakneſſe, then they who thinke they pleaſe God highly, if they doe any thing in their owne opinion more then others, how little warrant ſoeuer they haue for it.</p>
               <p>But to returne to that which I ſaid,<note place="margin">How the godly doe rightly vſe their lawfull liberties.</note> that the Lord inableth his to gouerne themſelues in the vſe of their goods and lawfull liberties (which is a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge:) that I be not vnderſtood amiſſe, I thinke good to expreſſe my mind more cleerely. If any ſhould gather or thinke, that I meane all Gods people do inioy this libertie and prerogatiue: I anſwere, that I am farre from that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> iudgement. But as may be well ſeene by that which I haue ſaid,<note place="margin">Who ſhall enioy this foreſaid priuiledge.</note> they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, that God will make them fit for it how vnfit ſoeuer they are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, they ſhall inioy it. I haue propounded to proue no other thing. For by this it may appeare, that ſeeing Gods children may be made partakers of ſuch a treaſure, which but few of them do inioy (and of the vnregenerate not one can:) therefore they beholding what he hath bequeathed them,<note place="margin">They that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not to this benefit, prouide ill for themſelues.</note> they ſhall ſhew, that they prouide ill for themſelues, if they attaine not to that, being ſo great a benefit which God hath ſo freely beſtowed vpon them. There ſhould need no more vnto ſuch, but this: that they may know, that he hath granted it out vnto them freelie, and calleth them euery where, to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> partaking of it: which being ſo, what ſhould holde them backe from inioying it? that whereas the moſt are as bruit beaſts, ſeruants to their luſts, yet theſe (of whom I ſpeake) may captiuate and ſubdue them: eſpecially, ſeeing it is greater honour to them, to ouercome their vnruely paſſions,<note place="margin">Pro. 16.32.</note> than to winne a citie.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe who count this honour, preciſeneſſe; and this imbondaging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of their vnruly affections to be more than Chriſtians need to be vrged vnto: what haue I to do with them? They are the enemies of the croſſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3.18.19.</note> they turne the grace of God into wantonneſſe, they make lawfull liberties to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnlawfull through their ill vſing of them. Of whom this I ſay,<note place="margin">The cauillers at this doctrine are vnder heauie and ſpeedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</note> which I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> will only ſay: that they will bring vnto them the ſwifter damnation. To which kind of people, &amp; to their like obiecting thus &amp; demanding: What? do theſe whom you commend ſo highlie for their good gouernment and temperance in the vſe of lawfull things, alwaies keepe one and the ſame courſe? I ſay, they moſt of all indeauour after that; and how full of ſadneſſe ſoeuer it be and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to others, yet to them it is ſweet and pleaſant: inſomuch, that although they be ſometime deceiued by the deuill, and driuen from their holde, yet as
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:16851:280"/>
ſoone as they perceiue that they haue gone too farre, and haue paſſed their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> bounds in their lawfull liberties, eating, drinking, recreation, vſe of mariage, pleaſuring in goods, truſting in friends, and making fleſh their arme; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne ſpeedily as out of open and manifeſt ſinnes, and thereby become more carefull another time: and when they ſee how many buffets light vpon others, who haue ſmall regard of ſobrietie or meaſure keeping; they ſee their portion to be great in reſtreining themſelues from that exceſſe in lawfull things, which they keepe no meaſure in. And thus much be ſaid of the firſt part or branch of this priuiledge. Wherein may be ſeene, that the Lord hath offered great fauour to his children, (to ſo many as eſteeme of it) that the glorie of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> preſent things and proſperitie in this world (which vndoe many) ſhal (yet) not bewitch nor deceiue them; but they ſhal be able to eſcape theſe ſnares by the ſpirituall wings that he hath giuen them for that purpoſe, to mount aboue them, as godly <hi>Ioſeph, Moſes</hi> &amp; many of Gods deare ſeruants did before them.</p>
               <p>But if it be asked: Why hath he giuen them to one and not to another? I anſwere: Seeing one ſetteth more ſtore by it than another. I ſpeake it to the ſhame of thoſe who giue occaſion, though they be otherwiſe well to be hoped of. For the cuſtome and boldneſſe in this ſinne of intemperancie and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines which we ſee in the moſt men, doth draw after them and their example, ſome euen of thoſe which are religious; cauſing them to haue their teeth ſet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> on edge, ſo eagerlie to follow them in their prophane courſe: and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of iniquitie doth coole their feruencie in ſeeking to weane their hearts from ſuch poiſoned and deceitfull baits and dainties as they ſee them ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to deuoure. For otherwiſe, though they are fraile, yet hauing receiued a taſte of the heauenly doctrine, which is the onely mother and nouriſher of true ſobrietie, they ſhould not ſo eaſily forget themſelues and be ouercome of their vaine deſires. For if popiſh dreames and fantaſies without all ground of Gods word, haue ſo inchanted princes and other perſons of great poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they haue drawen them from their pompe and many ſolemnities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Monaſteries and Nunries for the deceiuable hope of ſaluation: ſhould not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the word of trueth much more preuaile with them who haue had a right taſte of it, to renounce dangerous and vnlawfull liberties? And although they were led from one errour to another; yet if errour might doe ſo much with them, ſhould not the trueth doe much more with the children of the trueth, to abide in it and be gouerned by it? It is pitie, that any of the Lords beloued ſhould offer ſuch diſhonour to the glorious word of God, as to refuſe the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and giue occaſion to the vnbeleeuers to ſay: That God dieteth his people ſo meanly in his owne houſe, that they be driuen to eat with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate at their table (as it were) their poiſoned dainties. But let this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe make any ſuch of Gods ſeruants aſhamed, as haue giuen occaſion of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> it: and let them not follow the exceſſe of ſuch as know no better. And when they ſhall finde this doctrine hard to be practiſed, that is, to vſe their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie rightly and ſoberly; if then ſuch matter as this is, were read and well weighed of them, and the examples of thoſe which are contrarilie minded, what bondage they are in, I doubt not, but that the hardneſſe which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of, ſhould in good meaſure be aſſwaged.</p>

And thirdly, he teacheth them, aright and well to beare them, when he thinketh it not meet to deliuer them. And of theſe three, I will handle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the firſt in this chapter.</p>
               <p>Concerning the which point, it may eaſily be gathered by that which hath beene ſaid of the former priuiledges, how true this is:<note place="margin">The godly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape many troubles altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> that many troubles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer take hold of ſuch as walke after thoſe rules which I haue ſpoken of, and which inioy the ſaid priuiledges: and ſeeing all Gods children be ſuch as may doe ſo, therefore euen they may be deliuered from many troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (one as well as another) which yet the vngodly and vnregenerate cannot eſcape. For they whoſe hearts are cleanſed and ſanctified, ſo that they truely hate all maner of ſinne, and more ſpecially renounce in their liues the ſinne which they know; who indeauour to haue a good conſcience in all things, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> and doe all this with delight; and with delight alſo doe daily vſe the meanes to grow forward in this courſe: how can the plagues and calamities take hold on them, which doe on other men who are ſtrangers to ſuch a courſe? For the greateſt and ſoreſt puniſhments and troubles that fall vpon any, are brought vpon them by their ſinne (contrary to the erronious opinion of them, who thinke that religion is the chiefe cauſe of troubles) &amp; they are nothing els but the fruite thereof; and the greater ſinners that men are, the ſharper and heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er iudgements outward or inward doe meet with and take hold of them,<note place="margin">The greateſt ſinnes bring the greateſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</note> and the deepelier doth God drawe his bowe againſt them: and wherein is the ſcripture more plentifull, then in this argument and matter? For ſinne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> came the firſt puniſhment into the world, namely, death and Gods curſe,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.17.24.</note> which without ſinne had neuer beene knowen in all the world, with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting off our firſt parents and their poſteritie out of the fauour of God. Through ſinne, came all kindes of plagues and puniſhments vpon men;<note place="margin">Deut. 28.44.</note> as hunger, nakedneſſe, diſeaſes, the peſtilence, bondage to enemies and inuaſion of them, impriſonment, loſſe of goods, loſſe of life, and ſuch like. For ſinne, both perſon and place, whole cities and villages haue beene deſtroied:<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> from
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:16851:281"/>
the king to the begger, both <hi>Pharao</hi> and the raskall ſouldiers that peirced <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Chriſt through and platted a crowne of thornes vpon his head, and <hi>Iudas</hi> the purſebearer who was alſo the traytour; euen all theſe did by ſinne purchaſe to themſelues the reward of iniquity. All which plagues, they which were voide of thoſe ſinnes and the like which they committed, were freed from.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall not need to ſay much of this matter which is cleere in all mens eies: and yet I muſt ſay that which I doe in this place, becauſe it is the ground of this diſcourſe. For if this be true, that troubles and puniſhments are the fruite of ſinne, and that they who decline and goe aſide from the way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,<note place="margin">The freer from ſinne, the freer from trouble.</note> ſhall not taſt of them; it followeth that the children of God who doe ſo,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> haue a ſingular prerogatiue aboue others, &amp; may be free from many ſore vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. Neither ſhould this ſeeme ſtrange or admirable, foraſmuch as they forſake many vnlawfull liberties and vaine pleaſures which others hunt after.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But as I haue ſaid in handling the former priuiledges, ſo I muſt ſay in this: that the ſeruants of God may inioy this liberty; but not, that all doe ſo. For experience prooueth the contrary:<note place="margin">All the godly doe not avoid the ſorrowes which they might doe here.</note> namely, that ſundry of Gods people doe draw vpon themſelues many troubles through their owne default, which they might haue beene voide of, and doe trouble themſelues when God doth not trouble them: and it is one cauſe why I did enter into this worke, to teach ſuch how they may liue more at eaſe and in ſafety and without many incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> in this world, then they doe or many thinke they may poſſibly doe. For a great number,<note place="margin">Note.</note> euen of Gods children, do perſwade themſelues through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſcriptures (<hi>Math.</hi> 22.29) that foraſmuch as they heare, that we muſt goe through many tribulations to the kingdome of heauen,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.12.</note> therefore it can be no otherwiſe with vs, but that we muſt of neceſſity ſmart and be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted as oft and as many waies as we are; which is nothing ſo: for many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and dangers we might ſhun and avoide by taking heed to our ſelues, as Gods word teacheth vs, yea and as his ſpirit inableth vs alſo to doe; which yet through our folly, ſecurity, ſlougth and ſuch other faults of ours, too often doe vexe and diſquiet vs, and make our liues vtterly vnſavory and vnpleaſant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> vnto vs. For who can deny this, that many honeſt Chriſtians as well as worſe perſons,<note place="margin">Many trouble themſelues greatly by their corrupt affections:</note> doe cauſe a great part of their liues to be filled with vnquietneſſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and irkeſomneſſe, (then the which what can be reckoned greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles) and that, through impatience, anger, fretting, raſhly medling in other mens matters, and intemperately folowing and dealing in their owne; which vnbridled affections others of their brethren wiſely and carefully ſeeking and labouring to reſiſt, preuent and gouerne, are not moleſted nor troubled with?</p>
               <p>Or who ſeeth not this: that, euen men who deſerue to be well thought of for many cauſes,<note place="margin">And many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with thoſe which ouerrule them another way.</note> yet in ſome particular things refuſing to be directed aright, and following their owne will, and caried by their euill affections, take libertie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> to themſelues to miſſpende the time in fooliſh ieſting, idle and harmefull talking, in lightneſſe, in wantonneſſe of the eie, euill companionſhip, &amp;c. for the which ſweet meat they haue afterwards ſoure ſauce: and by thoſe meanes onely, raiſe vp in their hearts ſecret accuſations, checks of conſcience, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and feare of death and the iudgement day, quenching of the ſpirit of God, and ſuch like; and the better men they be, the ſooner and certainlier
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:16851:281"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they are thus rewarded. Are not theſe troubles? which if they had beene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to auoide, they might haue liued merily and with good contentation, as other good ſeruants of God haue done, and doe, who haue ſet more by true peace and quietneſſe with holineſſe, (without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord) then to looſe it for a little peece of their will,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> and for the inioying of the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>But theſe troubles becauſe they are inward, are not of ſo many nor ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſeene and diſcerned as were to be wiſhed, although too many, both god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wicked, doe oft both finde and feele them.<note place="margin">They bring alſo vpon themſelues outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles by their ſinnes.</note> I will therefore ſhew this in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> outward troubles; how many Chriſtians doe as well through their ſinne trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incomber their liues with them, as with the other kinde. For by their ſinne (as wilfull blindneſſe, careleſneſſe and vnbrideled affections) euen they as well as men vtterly vnreformed, doe bring vpon themſelues ſhame, ſutes in law, pouerty, debt, diſeaſes, impriſonment, loſſes, ill report, wicked poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, &amp;c. Theſe &amp; ſuch like (I am ſure) the ignoranteſt and worſt ſort of people doe count troubles and miſeries, and crie out of them, till they doe ofttimes depriue themſelues of life to the end they may be ridde of them.<note place="margin">It is prooued by many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note> But to prooue that they trouble themſelues with all theſe by their ſinnes, is it not a ſhame to them, when they be found to haue beene deceiuers, liers, boaſters, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſlaunderers, and in ſuch other behauiour offenſiue and ſcandalous? and doth not the ſame bring ill report with them alſo? doth not raſhneſſe, hot and haſty ſpeeches, prouoking one another cauſe ſutes and controuerſies which need neuer haue beene, and rendering like hard meaſure againe, as hath beene offered? doe not debt and pouertie ariſe of needleſſe and exceſſiue ſpendings, going aboue our abilitie in diet, apparell, purchaſing and building; and doth not he which loueth paſtime, prooue a poore man?<note place="margin">Prou. 21.17.</note> So by ſurfeiting come diſeaſes; and ill poſterity by ill education, with too much conniuencie and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie giuing; and by raſh and vnequall marriages as haſtie repentings for their conceiued griefes, if not departings one from the other; and an haughty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> minde cauſeth him that nouriſheth it, oft times to take vp his abode within the priſon walles. Theſe are a few of a great many which might as well be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned vp, but that I would ſay no more then I muſt needs.</p>
               <p>And what are the troubles of the world, if theſe be not? and yet who ſeeth not, that all theſe and their like are drawne vpon many Chriſtians by their ſin, as ſore corrections from God, ſeeing they do, &amp; may eaſily, through want of care and watchfulneſſe, oft offend thus. And true it is, that they might be well auoided, if ſinne were taken heed of and reſiſted, and by labour and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe the vnruly heart ſubdued. Neither let any anſwer me, that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained: for I affirme,<note place="margin">God giueth grace to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come theſe ſinnes.</note> that God giueth ſuch grace vnto fraile men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> whereby it may be atteined to, and teacheth how; and many there are (God haue the glory thereof) which comfortably finde it, who becauſe they hate to be ſeruants to any ſinne (although they cannot walke without ſinne) receiue no ſuch wages of ſinne and iniquitie as others doe.<note place="margin">Note.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And by this which I ſay, let it be conſidered, what eaſe and peace and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from many troubles this ſort of men inioy in their liues, which others goe without; and what ſorrow and calamities ſome fill their daies with, which
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:16851:282"/>
both they themſelues, and many others might be voide of. So that it is not as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> many haue ignorantly thought, that their troubles cannot be auoided; but (as I haue ſaid) many of them might be ſhunned,<note place="margin">What quiet ſome finde in their liues more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and how.</note> and their liues might be many waies and in ſundry reſpects more pleaſant and quiet then they be: which cauſeth ſome that ſee it to be thus with diuers Chriſtians, (and yet that theſe their troubles are not for well doing, but by their owne folly and procuring) cauſeth them (I ſay) to be ſo farre from the loue of true religion as they be: for whoſe ſake,<note place="margin">Note.</note> if we will not doe it to make our owne liues more comfortable, we ſhould abſtaine from offences; ſeeing the woe that is pronounced, will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,<note place="margin">Math. 18.7</note> certainly come vpon vpon vs: Woe to him that cauſeth another <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obiection.</note>But ſuch men are ready to excuſe and anſwere for themſelues, ſaying, that all cannot be alike, nor all cannot doe as ſome may: which obiection vnleſſe it be of pure ſimplicity, is a ſigne rather that they will goe forward, then ſeeke to recouer.<note place="margin">Anſwere.</note> But whatſouer, or whoſe ſoeuer it be, I anſwer, Let the weake indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to follow the ſtronger: and if any haue attained to more then other, in knowledge and experience of the minde and will of God, of them let others learne and take ſuch for their example: but let none pleaſe themſelues in that which they doe, as though they could not attaine to any better, but aime at further ripeneſſe and meaſure of perfection, deadly diſliking their ſmalleſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſinnes, rather then excuſing and defending thoſe which are great: and then it ſhall be verified that is written, to their no ſmall comfort: <hi>To him that hath, it ſhall be giuen,</hi>

               <p>And as for the troubles which we ſpeake of, let no man thinke that we may reioice in them,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.2. 1. Pet. 4.15.</note> ſeeing we are dehorted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> ſaying: Let no man ſuffer as an euil doer; ſeeing they are for iuſt cauſe vpon vs to vexe &amp; diſquiet vs, rather then that they can be any matter of ioy and gladnes to vs, except by godly ſorrow they bring vs to repentance, which (alas) is the leaſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> part of their thought who commit them. The Lord taketh no pleaſure in ſeeing vs to trouble our ſelues, and by our ſinnes to bring vexation into our liues; but ſheweth vs in his worde how much it diſpleaſeth him, that we ſhould be ſo much our owne foes, and vnwiſe for our owne good, and that we ſhould by our ſinnes hold ſo many good things from vs.<note place="margin">Ier. 5.25.</note> For ſo doth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet tell vs, that our ſinnes keepe many bleſſings from vs. And if they be our ſinnes, that is, our knowen ſinnes, our wilfull ſinnes, and thoſe which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through our owne default and folly, then let vs thanke our ſelues, and let vs charge our ſinnes, and not the Lord; in that, while we ſuffer ſo great and many troubles by them, we haue reaped thereby the iuſt fruite of our owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> labours. And ſeeing the ſinne might and ought to haue bene auoided; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch troubles as they haue cauſed, might alſo haue beene preuented.</p>
               <p>And this is that which I haue gone about to prooue, for the comfort of my bretheren: that many of vs who belong to the Lord, doe finde more troubles and afflictions then we neede to doe, and that through our owne ſinne. And therfore I conclude, ſeeing it is ſo: that the Lord who guideth his ſeruants in a
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:16851:282"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> more holy courſe then many of the other ſort are content to be guided in, doth thereby grant them this priuiledge and liberty: that they doe eſcape and are deliuered from infinite troubles and calamities, which others who count godlineſſe to ſtrict and preciſe a courſe for them, doe oft ruſh and runne into.</p>
               <p>Oh that this might enter into them deepely and doe them good,<note place="margin">To whom chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the comfort of this doctrine doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> for whoſe cauſe chiefely I haue ſpoken it; I meane, many of Gods people: who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue ſome loue to their brethren, and imbrace the goſpell hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely and reuerently, and haue many other good things in them, (it behooueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> me ſo to iudge of them) yea generally they propound to themſelues a good courſe, namely to liue after the goſpell: yet particularly, are ſuch in their liues as bring ſmall glory to the goſpell, but paſſe ouer many parts of their liues with very ſleight examination, as they doe alſo the gouernment of their hearts. Which faults notwithſtanding they be conuinced of, yet will they not yeeld, but goe forward in them ſtill: and as for thoſe things which they may lawfully doe, although they offend neuer ſo manifoldly in and about the ſame in maner of doing them,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 8.19. <hi>compared with</hi> 12.19.</note> yet will they by no meanes be counſelled to redreſſe that which is amiſſe: in whom it is no hard thing to ſee, how deare they pay for their liberties, which they will haue whatſoeuer they coſt them. They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> would hold peace with God, and ſometimes finde comfort in good things; but when that faileth (as it doth very oft) their liues would become very irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and tedious vnto them, if they made not themſelues mery in ſome earthly and tranſitory thing: and ſo they make fleſh their arme, which is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Almighty.</p>
               <p>Their defence,<note place="margin">Excuſes for mens ſinnes.</note> for that they doe not more particularly direct their waies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, is; that Ieſus Chriſt hath giuen them liberty and ſet them free; and that they haue no diſcretion, who vrge their bretheren ſo ſtrictly; and ſuch like: which all are but figge leaues to couer their nakedneſſe. For they ſee (though they would not) oftentimes, that thus liuing they pleaſe not God: neither (if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> they aduiſedly marke it) doe they pleaſe themſelues. Their diſquietneſſes, checks of conſcience and ſecret accuſations they cannot but feele, and many outward troubles do meet with them, as hath beene ſaid: and while they ſeeke the cauſe afarre off, beholde, it is neere vnto them; yea at hand, euen within them: their will, their vntamed affections, the ſturdineſſe and vnrulineſſe of their hearts and this their ſinne hath found them out.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore I exhort to conſider with no worſe minds than I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, what hath beene ſaid: and the Lord giue them grace ſo to doe: yea, and let ſuch godly Chriſtians whoſe teeth yet do ſometime water at the dainties of thoſe, though they ſee what ſorrow and reproch they ſuſteine for them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> thanke God heartily that they taſte not of ſuch poiſoned dainties with them.</p>
               <p>But now that I haue ſhewed, how the Lord doth preſerue them from ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, yea infinite troubles,<note place="margin">Many ſhun to be truely reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, becauſe they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid trouble. <hi>Luc. 16.25.</hi>

                  <hi>They will reioyce in their youth, and inioy the delights of ſinne, though it be but for a ſeaſon.</hi> But they marke not that anſwere to him in the Goſpell: <hi>Thou in thy life time receiuedſt thy pleaſure, therefore now thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented</hi>; nor to the yong man, by the Preacher, what was ſaid: <hi>Know, that for all theſe things, God will bring thee to iudgement.</hi> No ſuch thing (I ſay) they do conſider; but all that they obſerue, is this: How the better that men are for the moſt part, the leſſe they are ſet by, as it is ſaid: <hi>I haue ſeene the iuſt to periſh in his iuſtice:</hi> and the leſſe men faſhion themſelues after this preſent world, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> leſſe they may (they ſee) depart from a good conſcience, and be merrie after the common maner; which theſe obiecters count an irkeſome and tedious thing.</p>
               <p>Againe, they ſee that as the moſt part of men among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the godlie liue, haue them in ſome indignation and vile acount; ſo that they doe by meanes thereof,<note place="margin">The fooliſhneſſe of them that do ſo.</note> ſuſtaine mocks, taunts, checks and complaints before their betters, with cruell threatnings, and in perſecution times that they are conuented, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, railed on, yea and oft times put to death. Theſe things (I ſay) they only looke at with carnall eyes, and therefore are eaſily brought to beware, that they come not neere their courſe: but they neither conſider, that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> for righteouſneſſe ſake,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.12.</note> and therefore that they are bleſſed; neither, that they themſelues and ſuch as they are, liue in darkeneſſe and after the luſt of their eie and heart,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.8. Iob. 21.13.</note> and that their pleaſures wanze away as the cracking of thornes vnder a pot, and afterward they muſt come to their heauie and vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come account. Beſides this, though they haue ſorrow and vexation dailie in their liues, by meanes of their ſinne, vnleſſe they breake it off through fooliſh mirth and vanitie for a while: yet partly they ſee it not, neither count it any; as to be caſt into fretting, frowardneſſe, ſtrife, debate, &amp;c. And if they doe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe any trouble by their deſerts &amp; ill doings, as ſhame, charge by the purſe, and other puniſhment; yet they will chuſe to ſuffer much this way, rather than <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> they will be driuen from their will, and the inioying of their fond liberties.</p>
               <p>And now let all wiſe men iudge, what theſe kinds of men haue gained by following their ſinfull courſe: let (I ſay) the vttermoſt of their gaine and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure be conſidered, and what troubles they haue ſhunned in ſhunning to liue godly.<note place="margin">Pſ. 32.10.</note> But when they haue done, ſeeing the Lord hath ſufficiently confirmed this:<note place="margin">Num. 32.23.</note> that plagues abide the vngodly, &amp; (that they may be ſure of it) that their ſin ſhall finde them out; let none looke to prouide well for himſelfe that way, namely, to ſhunne and be farre from the ſincere practiſe of a religious and godly life, to the end he may be free from troubles: for he can no other way more certainly and ſpeedily multiplie them. And whereas it is obiected, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> the beſt of Gods ſeruants are not free from troubles, but ſuffer much for their profeſſion and a good conſcience: it is granted. But their troubles for thoſe cauſes, are of another kinde, namely, fatherly chaſtiſements to holde them in from periſhing with the world; or trials of their patience, faith and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God in them;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.32. 1. Pet 1.7. Iohn 16.20.</note> or ſuch as they ſuffer for good cauſes; and ſo weepe and lament, when the world is iocund and mery: and therefore they turne euer
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:16851:283"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to their profit,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28. Eccleſ. 8.12.</note> as I ſhall haue occaſion to ſhew more plentifullie in another place more fit for that purpoſe. And to conclude, let all know this, that though a ſinner doe euill an hundred times, and God prolongeth his daies; yet that it ſhall be well with them that feare the Lord, and doe reuerence before them. And thus much of the firſt point in this ſecond branch of this priuiledge, that the godly may liue void of manie and great troubles: and therefore, that ſuch as doe not, may thanke themſelues for it, whether we vnderſtand inward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt and feare, or outward puniſhments that are fruits of ſinne.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond point is, that they may alſo aſſure themſelues, that the Lord will deliuer them (and that of very fauour) out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles, though they ſee not how: euen as I haue ſhewed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> that ſome ſhall not touch them at all. For although they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſee not how, nor any other likelihood but that they ſhall long oppreſſe them, yea vtterly conſume them; yet euen then doth the Lord know how to deliuer them, and hath many waies, which we could not ſee, to rid them out of ſo great calamities: and ſo he doeth,<note place="margin">God oft deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</note> either before they haue long lien vpon them, or at leaſt, before they haue beene driuen to any extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie by them, and before they haue had their courſe; as in the deliuerances of <hi>Dauid,</hi> mentioned 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.20.23.24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. chapters thorowout, is to be ſeene. And this he doth as oft as it is expedient:<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.7. 2. Cor. 12.9. Prou. 11.8. <hi>And the wicked come in their roome.</hi>
                  </note> when in the meane ſeaſon he dealeth not ſo with the vnbeleeuers, but when the other eſcape, they come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> many times in their roome, as the wiſe man ſaith: <hi>The godly eſcape out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the Lords deliuering of them, and the wicked are come in their ſtead.</hi> Now for proofe of that which I ſaid [that God deliuereth them out of many] what is more plaine then that which the prophet ſaith:<note place="margin">Pſal. 124.1.</note> 
                  <hi>If the Lord had not beene on our ſide, (may Iſraell now ſay) if the Lord had not been on our ſide when men roſe vp against vs, they had then ſwallowed vs vp quicke, when their wrath was kindled against vs, &amp;c. But praiſed be the Lord, who hath not giuen vs a prey vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their teeth. Our ſoule is eſcaped as a bird out of the ſnare of the fouler, the ſnare is broken, and we are eſcaped.</hi> The Apoſtle prooueth it alſo in his words:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>We would not haue you ignorant (brethren) of our affliction which came vnto vs in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Aſia, how we were preſſed out of meaſure, paſsing ſtrength, ſo that we altogither doubted euen of life: but God deliuered vs from ſo great a death, and doth deliuer vs; in whom we trust alſo that he will deliuer vs.</hi>

<pb n="536" facs="tcp:16851:284"/>
before it could be effected, how did the Lord at the humble ſute of <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> and the Queene <hi>Heſter</hi> in prayer and faſting, ſeeking vnto him, turne away the plague from them, and deliuering them, bring their enemies and <hi>Haman</hi> the firſt of all the reſt (as he was the chiefeſt) into their roome? euen as <hi>Daniel</hi> was deliuered out of the lions denne (the Lord ſhutting their mouthes that they ſhould not hurt him:<note place="margin">Dan. 6.23.</note>) <hi>but his accuſers being throwne in after that he was deliuered, the lyons had the maſtery ouer them, and brake their bones or euer they came at the ground of the denne.</hi> The whole ſtory of the Bible is full of ſuch examples: wherein this is moſt cleerely to be ſeene, how God hath deliuered his, truſting in him, from and out of many and great dangers and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> calamities. So that if God doe this for his, then his ſeruants may aſſuredly looke for it.</p>
               <p>And yet I would all ſhould know, that I doe not bring theſe, as I might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others to this end, onely that I might prooue that God hath deliuered his children out of troubles:<note place="margin">Gen. 21.15. 1.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The wicked not ſo.</note>And thus are Gods ſeruants onely deliuered out of their troubles: the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly haue no part with them in this fellowſhip.

               <p>I anſwere:<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> That God doth not indeed ſpeake to vs after that maner that he did to our fathers, as we are certified in the epiſtle to the Ebrewes;<note place="margin">2.

                  </gap>s, but generall promiſes which were made to all the faithfull (excepting that for ſome eſpeciall cauſes ſome particular promiſe of deliuerence was made to ſome certaine perſons, and for waighty cauſes; and yet thoſe were not made for all times,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 15.25.</note> nor in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> troubles:) as may be ſeene by the anſwere of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who being driuen out of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> by his ſonne <hi>Abſolon</hi> riſing vp againſt him moſt traiterouſly &amp; vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, ſaid vnto <hi>Zadok</hi> the prieſt, Carry the arke of God againe into the city: <hi>If I ſhall finde fauour in the eies of the Lord, he will bring me againe, and ſhew me both it, and the tabernacle thereof: but if he thus ſay, I haue no delight in thee; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold heere am I, let him doe to me as ſeemeth good in his eies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It it cleare by this, that <hi>Dauid</hi> in his trouble did not know whether God would deliuer him or no; neither did he know what the end ſhould be; nor had any promiſe from God, that he ſhould returne againe to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in peace, and behold the arke and tabernacle any more: yet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſought to the Lord, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and humbled himſelfe, and was not ſo amaſed with the affliction (as ſtrange as it was) but that he remembred the Lord, and praied to him, and worſhipped in token that he had made God his ſtay and defence, whatſoeuer the iſſue of his ſore triall ſhould be. The like is to be ſeene in the example of <hi>Sidrach, Miſach</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi>: who when they heard the ſtraight charge of king <hi>Nabucadnezar,</hi> That whoſoeuer ſhould not at the ſound of the inſtruments of muſicke fall downe and worſhip the image which he had ſet vp, ſhould be caſt
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:16851:285"/>
into the midſt of an hot fiery furnace immediately, anſwered the king and ſaid:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> 
                  <hi>O Nabuchadnezar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>we are not carefull to anſwere thee in this matter. Behold, our God whom we ſerue, is able to deliuer vs from the hot fiery furnace, and he will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs out of thy hand, ô king; but if he do not, be it knowen vnto thee (ô king) that we wil not ſerue thy gods, nor worſhip the golden image which thou haſt ſet vp.</hi> We ſee they knew not whether God would deliuer them or no: but this they were perſwaded of, that he had a moſt tender &amp; fatherly care ouer them, and would ſhew the ſame in the time of their need; and if it were for his glory he would deliuer them. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now (to returne to our ſelues) if we in our tribulations be thus vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> by the generall promiſes of God, if we ſue and ſeeke to him with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be deliuered [If it be expedient in his eies] indeauouring to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that which ſhall fall out on either ſide,<note place="margin">Note.</note> we haue behaued our ſelues as it became vs, we haue ſought to him aright as his word teacheth vs: and if we after this obtaine deliuerance, God hath heard vs, he hath kept pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with vs, and we haue receiued good proofe of our faith. And who can deny, but that it is a great priuiledge when we obtaine deliuerance thus? and thus doing, although we be not deliuered, yet we reſt perſwaded (howſoeuer our weake nature hold backe) that the Lord hath done iuſtly and well; hoping with ſuch confidence, as of fraile fleſh may be obtained, for anſwerable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſtrength and conſolation vnto the meaſure of our afflictions in our greateſt neede. And if men ſee no great matter in this, let them wade a little deeper, and weigh how they are vpholden by their faith that they fall not to ſhifts and vnlawfull meanes (when otherwiſe they ſee no way to eſcape) as the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers doe;<note place="margin">1. Sam. 28.7. Iona. 2.8. 1. Sam. 25.37. Math. 27.5. Pſ. 73.13.14. Iona. 4.4.</note> and namely, <hi>Saule</hi> with other, who waiting vpon lying vanities, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke Gods goodneſſe: neither are ſtriken with deadneſſe, as <hi>Nabal</hi> when he heard heauy tidings; nor with diſtruſt and diſpaire, as <hi>Iudas</hi>; neither with complaining and murmuring at God, as his owne children ſometime when they are not vpholden by faith, are forced to doe. And yet if we haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance any other way, as by carnall pollicie, ſubtill ſhifts, or the like, (as I doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> not deny, but by ſuch meanes it may come) it is ſo farre off that we ſhould count that a priuiledge or any matter of reioicing, that it maketh our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on double, yea ten-fold thereby, which was in a maner none at all before.</p>
               <p>And thus I conclude this other point, affirming, that as it is a ſingular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue to vs, that we may be kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many troubles altogether, which other cannot be freed from: ſo it is no leſſe honour, priuiledge and fauour, that we may be deliuered out of many (which others ſhall not be deliuered from) as I haue ſhewed and prooued in this preſent point; but yet then onely it is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge (as I haue ſaid) that we may be deliuered, not when we vſe vnlawfull meanes for it, but when we looke for it thus: [If God will: if he ſee it good and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> expedient] and therefore doe waite patiently vntill he ſend an iſſue: which grace the vnbeleeuers neuer haue, neither can haue: onely Gods children are capable of it; but for all that, few euen of them inioy it, as either neuer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing learned it ſoundly and cleerely, or not beleeuing that they may poſſiblie attaine to it: which cauſeth ſo much vnchearefulneſſe, diſcontent, &amp;c. in our troubles, as grudging againſt God, yea &amp; indirect ſhifts to auoid them; and

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> much hollowneſſe, coldneſſe and negligence in the ſeruice of God and Chriſtian cariage of our ſelues before trouble commeth,<note place="margin">Note.</note> for feare that when it commeth we ſhall be inconſtant: whereas, if it were otherwiſe, much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly comfort might be reaped in our liues, which now is not.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He third point of this ſecond branch now followeth, which is no leſſe then a great priuiledge it ſelfe beſide the two former, and that is: that the Lord teacheth his children aright and well to beare thoſe afflictions, which he thinketh meet to try them with and to hold them vnder. So that they may not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and goe vnder them patiently and contentedly,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119.71.</note> but alſo receiue much good by them, as they themſelues be conſtrained to confeſſe. And as the Lord teacheth his people to make this vſe of their afflictions:<note place="margin">Iohn 16.6.7. 1. Pet. 1.5.6.</note> ſo euery one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> his, may alſo learne the ſame, if they be wiſe enough to thinke ſo; that is, to be reſolued that for their exceeding benefite and profit he ſendeth them. For then and neuer till then, they frame and addreſſe themſelues to receiue them from God thankefully and meekely, when his word hath throughly ſetled this thought and perſwaſion in them: which wiſdome few haue or attaine vnto, thus to thinke, but their owne fooliſh reaſon; which (while they ſeeke nothing but eaſe and freedome from trouble) leadeth them a cleane contrary way, that is, to be vtterly vnwilling to beare them, euen diſcouraged and heauy hearted as oft as they thinke on them. This wiſdome therefore muſt be ſought for, euen of the good ſeruants of God:<note place="margin">Luc. 9.23.</note> that they looke for them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> daily, and be ready to receiue them from God. This it is, that muſt ſuppreſſe and checke all contrary power of carnall reaſon, which will be otherwiſe in the way at all times to annoy them.</p>
               <p>It followeth therefore next and moſt conſequently to declare, how the poore people of God may come by this wiſdome: &amp; then to ſhew, how it gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to make ſuch profitable and good vſe of their croſſes and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as no other but they are able to doe the ſame.

And then he goeth forward to teach them, how they might come by it; and that he teacheth them thus:<note place="margin">Ia. 1.5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man want wiſdome let him aske it of God, who giueth to euery one plentifully, and caſteth no man in the teeth:</hi> but this watchword he giueth: That they muſt ſee, they aske in faith, and they ſhal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it.

And let it not be thought much that I ſay, He hath no worſe end in afflicting vs: for we ought to be perſwaded throughly of this, that the Lord our God louing vs, he cannot intend our hurt in the leaſt maner, howſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe him to exerciſe vs.<note place="margin">Lam. 3.33. 1.

               <p>But to ſatisfie ſome, (who, I know, are many) which looking to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles words [<hi>that all turneth to the beſt to ſuch as loue God</hi>] and looke no further: whereupon they conclude, if God will haue our troubles turne to our good, what need we take any further thought about the matter?

               <p>But if they beleeue that Scripture to be written for them, and applie it; then

They ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> teach them alſo experience of greater acknowledging Gods fatherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which worketh and bringeth forth theſe ſweet graces in them, by as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely occaſions, as the ſoft waters guſh out of the hard and ſtonie rocke: for in others, what doe afflictions cauſe for the moſt part that haue them, but rage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and fretting and ſuch like? Beſides, in thoſe who are rightly exerciſed in the bearing of them, they hold them from many ſinnes which others runne into: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4.5."/> they make them more humble and thankfull: they hearten them by cuſtome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> therein to beare greater,<note place="margin">Lam. 3.27.</note> yea greater than they thought poſſible that euer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> they ſhould haue gone vnder: and with all theſe commeth moſt ſound and exceeding comfort,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.2.

               <p>Therefore if the ſeruants of God may inioy theſe with many other ſuch commodities by their afflictions, and haue ſo good liking of the Chriſtian life that they will not forſake it for the greateſt of them, I conclude this third branch as the two former: That the Lord hath not left their afflictions vpon them to vexe them, and make their liues weariſome and vnpleaſant to them; but that they ſhould receiue much good and benefit by them. And although they be not without ſharpneſſe, yet the Chriſtian life hath ſo many ſweet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> fruits of them therewith, that as men are not wearie of the pleaſant ſpring time though it be anoied with the flea: ſo we do not loath our afflicted eſtate being ſo many waies gainfull, for ſome bitterneſſe that accompanieth the ſame: for holy ſecuritie through the favour of God, a good conſcience, and confidence of our cauſe that it is good,<note place="margin">Animi ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, conſcientia bona, cauſae fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducia, plurimùm valent ad ſuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendas afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones.</note> maketh euen a hard ſtate eaſie, or at leaſt tolerable. And theſe priuiledges which I haue now ſpoken of, who can ſufficientlie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that our glorious God doth communicate to mortall men, yea vile ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which were once without God in the world?

And yet ſo much the greater they are, and better to be accounted of, inaſmuch as the longer they be inioyed, the more fruit and comfort they bring to him that hath his part in them. And when we finde not this doctrine ſauourie and ſweet to vs,

God giueth to his, greater grace then they could aske:</note> and will giue more grace and greater meaſure of his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gifts, then they before they had them, could either aske or thinke. And this is woorthy to be conſidered with the former, as a further increaſe and higher degree of the fruits of his loue, that he doth ſo largely and bountifully reach out his hand vnto them, that thereby they may be inriched as farre beyond the beginnings of their true happines, as their beginnings were beyond their firſt condition before it in the iudgement of all men.</p>
               <p>For cleerer proofe heereof, we are to know,<note place="margin">As in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar may be ſeene.</note> that he maketh them to grow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> in ſounder vnderſtanding of his wil, in more aſſurance of faith and ſtrength of hope, in more patience vnder the croſſe, more moderation in the vſe of their lawfull liberties and benefits of this life, he giueth them better rule ouer their hearts and affections, and that in more things then at the firſt,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and ofter &amp; ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilier; and ſo ouer their liues and actions, their tongues, their hands, their eies, their eares.

And (to comprehend much in few words) the whole courſe of their life is much better gouerned then it was wont to be, and the image of God more liuely and cleerely reſtored. And are not theſe (thinke we) priuiledges farre aboue their expectation, and greater then they could looke for?</p>
               <p>All which the Apoſtle, knowing that they were dainties prepared for the Lords beloued ones, and a great treaſure, (although hidden from the world) did daily wiſh and pray for, that they might be giuen to the church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſa, as he ſheweth in theſe words: <hi>After that I heard of your faith in Christ Ieſus, and loue towards all the Saints, I ceaſed not to pray for you,</hi>

that the graces which he put them in hope of,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.13.</note> and incouraged them to looke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> for, were not more and farre greater then they might poſſibly be partakers of?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Examples.</note>Which thing may liuely be ſeene in <hi>Moſes</hi> example, if we compare the time wherein God did firſt call him to goe to <hi>Pharao</hi> to bring away his people from the bondage and ſlauerie in the which he held them in Egypt, with the daies which came after, when he brought them from thence. For when he ſhould firſt goe, he ſhewed great weakneſſe to be in him; himſelfe an vnmeet perſon to go before a king;<note place="margin">Exod. 4.11.</note> and the burthen too great for him to go vnder; as by his owne words may appere when he ſaith: <hi>Who am I, that thou ſhouldeſt ſend me vnto</hi> Pharao, <hi>and that I ſhould bring the children of Iſraell out of Egypt?</hi> But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> afterwards, how boldly did he his meſſage vnto the king, neither fearing his threats nor countenance:<note place="margin">Exod. 10.17.</note> but rather (as it plainly appeareth) <hi>Pharao</hi> was ſore afraid of him; as in that he confeſſed to him (in great anguiſh of heart) his ſin, and deſired that he would ſue vnto the Lord for him (acknowledging that he could much preuaile with him) that his plagues might ceaſe. Behold heerein one of the greateſt matters (as is the feare and face of princes:) he which was afraid to looke <hi>Pharao</hi> in the face at the firſt; was afterward, through ſtrength of faith by cleauing to the Lords commandement and promiſe, able to do his meſſage to him with exceeding courage &amp; boldneſſe. And if in this one grace and gift of God he ſo increaſed, (which of all other ſeemeth the hardeſt) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ouercomming that timorouſneſſe and faint heartedneſſe which would (if it had not beene by ſpirituall manhood and courage expelled) haue made him vtterly vnfit for the diſcharging of ſo weighty a duty; what doubt is there, but that in other graces of God he increaſed alſo proporcionably? Which doth further confirme that which I haue taken in hand to ſhew: that is, that the Lord giueth that grace vnto his beloued, from which they were moſt far off both in their owne ſight and in the iudgement of others, and therefore (as I haue ſaid) more then they ſometime could aske or looke for.</p>
               <p>And no other thing did our Sauiour Chriſt meane, when <hi>Nathaniell</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him to be very God for that he ſaw a token thereof in him,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> he ſaid: <hi>Nathaniell, becauſe I ſaid: [I ſaw thee vnder a figge tree] beleeueſt thou?

Such therefore as ſee themſelues faultie and weake this way, let them learne of them which haue better experience in the waies of God than themſelues, and which doe more chearefully go before them: that they by their example may more ſoundly and conſtantly goe forward.

And to be ſo farre beyond our firſt beginnings in louing and obeying that which we know, that as we were then readie and forward in a little (when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> we knew no more:) ſo we may now giue occaſion to many to praiſe God for vs, whiles they ſee the ſame readineſſe and forwardneſſe to continue in vs, as our knowledge is increaſed? And as we were then carefull ouer other for the good of their ſoules: ſo why ſhould we not be ſtill of the ſame minde, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another daily with comfort, &amp; prouoking to loue &amp; to good works, and not neglect that dutie for the care of our bodies and wealth? The which I

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> heartily wiſh were done but with that alacritie and cheerefulneſſe, which I my ſelfe haue ſeene many yeeres agone.</p>
               <p>But alas, how rare a thing is this to finde either in the one or in the other? which cauſeth this and ſuch other worthie prerogatiues of the faithfull, as are ſpoken of in the Scripture to be in ſmall account, ſeeing few examples are found of this practiſe. And by this it may be ſeene what is to be vnderſtood by growing, and what this priuiledge is, in the laying forth of the which I am now occupied: namely, that a true Chriſtian may be able to ſee and in trueth to affirme, that he inioieth farre better liking, greater freedome, much more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> eaſe and ſweetneſſe in ſeruing God, and in the Chriſtian courſe, then ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he was able to doe or euer looked for. That he ſeeth farre greater light in the will and word of God, and bewty in the Godly life; and hath much more conqueſt ouer his rebellious heart in ſubduing the affections thereof, then euer he thought had beene poſſible for him; which who ſo inioieth not, is vniuſtly depriued of ſo great a commodity, as beſide the ſaluation of his ſoule, hath none like it vpon the earth: and yet cannot be ſeparated from that neither.</p>
               <p>And yet as great as it is,<note place="margin">The Lord thinketh it not to great for his.</note> I haue ſhewed that the Lord thinketh it neither too great nor too good for his children, but hath bequeathed it vnto them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them free graunt of it; and ſo they may haue their part in it, although the greater the benefit is, the more ſtrongly the diuill keepeth men backe from poſſeſſing it, yea euen many of Gods deare children themſelues, whom he holdeth in the cordes of ſinne and baites of vanity: ſo that thereby they loſe and forgoe a great part in this heauenly priuiledge and liberty. But how he and they doe ſtop their proceedings in grace and Godlineſſe, may be ſeene in the former treatiſe of the lets. Yet I cannot omit here to put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this one let againe, that without great heed taking they ſhall weaken their loue to their brethren through conceites and taking of pritches one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an other, and that oft times without any iuſt cauſe: ſo that they ſhall be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> much feebled therby from duties of loue, which (if it were well conſidered) had little need to be ſo, being ſufficient to hinder euery good enterpriſe, then the which their need be no greater.</p>
               <p>But if theſe and ſuch like be not their ſtops and ſtaies, let not any obiect and ſay: that they deſire with their hearts to be partakers of this priuiledge and benefit, if they knew how: for if they were willing to be perſwaded, to vſe thoſe meanes with that free and ready heart, conſtantly and daily, which they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are willing to doe, their deſire ſhould quickely be accompliſhed, and they made partakers of that which they wiſh; and that is, alwaies to make rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of that to be their chiefeſt treaſure, To grow in grace and in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of Chriſt: and therefore without ceaſing to keepe their hearts vnto it,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and to thinke there is nothing more to be regarded, nor of greater weight and neceſſity, then to beſtow the day and the ſeuerall parts of it as they are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and as many of them alſo haue done ſometime, that they may ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to goe forward.</p>
               <p>I appoint to them no new or ſtrange way; but faithfulneſſe and conſtancy in keeping of that which already hath beene ſhewed them; and the ſame or
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:16851:290"/>
like direction for the daily gouerning of themſelues, which hath already bene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſet downe to them; aſſuring themſelues, that God will not be wanting from time to time in bleſſing the ſame, vnto them. Then as the corne rooted in good ground, through the bleſſing of God by ſeaſonable weather, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth farre vnlike that in few moneths, which it was at the new comming vp and appearing aboue the ground: ſo ſhall they by the ſame meanes daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued reuerently and in faith, become farre vnlike themſelues, which they were at their firſt beginning; and they ſhall finde (as I haue ſaid) through the ſame ſhine and dew of Gods bleſſing, that increaſe, which before they neuer looked for.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/>
               </p>
               <p>But ſeeing there are many of Gods deere ſeruants, who being by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the diuill either altogether depriued of teaching, or ſeldome taught, or not ſo taught that they may grow; heere I am inforced to bewaile their eſtate, and mourne with them, exorting all ſuch, that as they ſee any further light and liberty then in times paſt:<note place="margin">All muſt be ready to grow to that grace which they may attaine to.</note> ſo they indeauour to goe forward, though they cannot attaine to that which others may. And withall I ſay vnto the other which may profit better, as hauing greater helpes, that they forſlow not the time, nor neglect to reape the benefit daily which thereby is offered them. For as in the glory of the kingdome of heauen the higheſt degree of happines ſhall be inioied, becauſe men ſhall then be wholly ſubiect vnto God, and obey <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> him willingly in all things: ſo the next is, to be more ſubiect to his will, and in more things and vpon better ground; and to be better acquainted with the minde of God and his ſecrets, then in times paſt: which may make them more forward, then when they firſt beleeued.</p>
               <p>As for them, which thinke there is no nearer fellowſhip to be inioied with God, while they are heere on earth, then they themſelues haue attained vnto; nor any greater meaſure of grace then they are partakers of: let them inioy their opinion alone, till they be aſhamed of it: let vs rather hope (to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorifying of God) to ſee that to be our ordinary diet,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which hath beene ſometimes our banquetting cheere; I meane, to be able better and better <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> to reioice in all things that we goe about through the day, whereas ſometime we could ſcarſely doe it at any time in the day; and in nothing be diſcouraged whiles we haue the Lord both in precept and promiſe to goe before vs. Little perſwaſion ſhould need heereunto, if mens hearts were ſet vpon this Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an courſe, as they are vpon deceitfull vanities. It is not ſeene with bodily eie, and therefore ſlender credit is giuen to it. It is almoſt vnknowen, what bewty and contentation the beleeuing ſoule findeth in it, and therefore in ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, no not with many of the better ſort: and therefore few grow vp to that which they might. But ô earthly peace and proſperity!

                  <hi>Hee which hath begun this good worke in his, will alſo finiſh and make an end of the ſame.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Agreeable heerunto is that ſaying of our Sauior:<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.39. &amp; 10.28.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the Fathers wil which hath ſent me, that of all which he hath giuen me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it vp againe at the laſt day.</hi> And againe: <hi>None ſhall take them out of my hands.</hi> Therefore if God will finiſh the worke that he hath begun in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if he will keepe them ſafe vntill all danger be paſt; that is, to the day of the reſurrection; and if none ſhall take them out of his hands: it is manifeſt that all ſuch as are grafted into Chriſt by faith, and who haue beene effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called into the number of Gods children through the preaching of the Goſpell vnto the ſure and certaine hope of eternall life, ſetting their faces dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly toward the ſame; ſhall be ſafely conducted home, and abide in the ſame <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> eſtate vnto the end.</p>
               <p>But as great a benefit as it is, That they ſhall continue to the end;<note place="margin">God letteth them know it that they ſhall:</note> yet if the Lord would hide it from them, and keepe them from the knowledge of it, it ſhould be much leſſer: and therfore this is further to be added, that they which know themſelues to be the Lords; may alſo know, that they ſhall be preſerued and kept ſafe againſt all aduerſarie power of the deuill and his inſtruments, and ſo perſeuere vnto the end. For although it ſeeme to be a myſterie and a ſecret, that the determinate will and counſell of God concerning this matter ſhould be knowen;<note place="margin">Though it be a ſecret to the world. <hi>2.

So it may pleaſe God for cauſes beſt knowen to him (but yet alwaies iuſt and moſt certainely for his owne glory) to take away ſome of his good ſeruants ſuddenly: and to viſit ſome other of them with loſſe of their inward ſenſes, vnderſtanding, of the vſe of reaſon, memory, &amp;c. for ſuch effects ſome kinde of deaſeaſes doth worke; ſo that, in that eſtate they ſhall ſpeake they wot not what.

               <p>Which I doe not ſpeake, as minding in the leaſt manner to mooue men to thinke, that it is but a light and ſmall matter to cut off vnnaturally the naturall life,<note place="margin">He that doth ſo aduiſedly, is a murtherer in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</note> which God as a moſt ſingular earthly benefit hath giuen: for as it is feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſo much as to heare it named; ſo all they that doe it, being in perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and knowing what they doe, ſhall be ſure to ſmart for it, as for committing the higheſt degree of murther.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/>
               </p>
               <p>But as no man blameth a yong infant, nor rateth it for caſting the hat or coat into the fire, as he would a childe of fiue or ſixe yeeres of age; the one hauing ſufficient diſcretion to know it doth euill, the other not: ſo it is with the two kindes of people, which may poſſibly depriue themſelues of life: the one knoweth what he doth, and therefore ſhall be ſure to pay deare for it; the other doth not: and hauing before that pange and diſtraction in times paſt witneſſed an holy and chriſtian heart by an vnrebukeable conuerſation, he is not to be iudged according to that one action, the which he alwaies abhorred when he had perfect and ſound remembrance; and when he did it, did he knew not what.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
               </p>
               <p>And if we doe what we can to comfort him, which againſt his will and through the malice and tyranny of the diuill, was ſuddenly forced to vtter ſome blaſphemous word againſt the maieſty of God; and thinke that by good right we ought to doe ſo: how much more ought we to haue a charitable iudgement of him, who hauing euer ſince he firſt gaue profeſſion to the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, beene well reported of the brethren and of the trueth it ſelfe; hath at one time when he wanted his right and ſound iudgement, fallen into this hainous treſpaſſe?</p>
               <p>And thus I hauing anſwered that which might ſeeme to breed greateſt queſtion of the perſeuerance of the godly in the fauour of God, (which caſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> through Gods goodneſſe doth not fall out very oft:) I may much more boldly affirme of any other of Gods children, that he will neuer forſake any of his: no, although he load them with ſome hard burden of ſorrow and paine, yet will he not forget them (they being deare vnto him;) neither doth he forget himſelfe in bringing a more ſore death vpon any of them, but theereafter he maketh their conſolations to increaſe alſo.<note place="margin">2.

For neither is any death more happy,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.10.</note> then to ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake: and the paine of body vpon the death bed hath beene found farre to exceed it.</p>
               <p>But if corrupt and ſlougthfull fleſh ſhould thinke it great gaine to accept of life in that danger through denying Chriſt and renouncing the trueth,<note place="margin">No cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to liue, when we muſt needs diſhonor God.</note> we ſhould conſider, what anguiſh we ſhould liue in and what a hell, when we haue depriued our ſelues of all comfort from God, as hauing renounced him; and when we could not liue but with thoſe, who ſuppreſſing and perſecuting god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> muſt needs make our life more tedious and vncomfortable then any death: which being conſidered, what ioy (thinke we) is this to a godly ſoule, to ſee that day when an end of all miſeries is come? when he ſeeing that his departure is at hand, may ſay: This day is that,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.1.</note> which is better to me then all that are paſt, ſeeing I am now going into euerlaſting glory?</p>
               <p>Laſtly it ought to be conſidered, that as the three children ſaid: <hi>We haue a God that can deliuer vs: but if he doe not, yet we will fall into his hands, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelues vnto him, as vnto a faithfull keeper,</hi> not being vnmindefull of his promiſe, which is: <hi>Call vpon me in the time of need, and I will deliuer thee</hi>:<note place="margin">Pſ. 50.15.</note> And againe: <hi>When they ſhall draw you before rulers, for my ſake,</hi>

               <p>So that in the partaking and inioying of all our priuiledges, we ſee, that this faith is required to be as the hand by which we ſhould receiue them, and whereby we hold and poſſeſſe them and all the comfort that commeth with them: and without it, we haue no part nor portion in any of them; neither thoſe which more eſpecially concerne the life to come, as the ſaluation of our ſoules; neither this preſent life, as the other fruites of the ſpirit, which I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> haue already ſpoken of; ſeeing the word which propoundeth theſe from God vnto vs, muſt be mixed with faith: for we haue not more vſe of the aire,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.2.</note> fire nor water, then we haue of it.</p>

               <p>Secondly, that we vſe oft to meditate of the vanity of all things, and of the contempt of the world, and ſet our mindes on things heauenly;<note place="margin">Col. 3.1. &amp;. 2.</note> that ſo we may preſerue and continue that liberty.</p>

I will not (I ſay) wade further then I may wade ſafely; what the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> kindes and varietie of pleaſures are particularly which the righteous are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of, the Lord hath not reuealed vnto me, and therefore I am not aſhamed to ſay,<note place="margin">The ioyes of heauen cannot be conceiued.</note> I know not: It is enough, that I am ſure they are ſo great and many, that they cannot be once thought of according to their woorthineſſe, no not of the wiſeſt, who can ſee furtheſt and enter moſt deepely into matters.</p>
               <p>Onely this I will ſay, and with this I will end: That the Lord ſhall there wipe away euery teare from the eies of his children; and they which ſowed in teares before heere on earth, ſhall there reape in ioy; death ſhall no more raigne, neither ſhall there be any more lamentation, nor crying, nor ſorrow:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and for the glory, beautie, pleaſure and eternitie which ſhall be found there, it is compared vnto a goodly citie; whoſe ſhining is like vnto a ſtone, moſt precious as a Iaſper ſtone,<note place="margin">Reu. 21.11. &amp;c.</note> cleere as chryſtall, &amp;c.

But oh, that it were ſo accounted of, euen among ſuch; and yet when I, or any haue ſaid what we can, we haue ſaid but a little: for it is farre greater then we can ſet it out to be.

               <p>And as all theſe priuiledges are great, and we haue good proofe that God hath giuen his deare children liberty to inioy them: ſo this further commends <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> their happy condition, that they may know that all theſe belong to them, and they haue the word of God among them, and they may alſo approoue of, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and delight in the ſame; and be able to ſee thereby, how they are made partakers of them all by faith, and how thereby they haue moſt ſweet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him and with Chriſt by his ſpirit,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.17.</note> (which the world cannot haue) and moſt heauenly comfort and peace thereby; and hauing learned experience

               <p>And therefore the Lord ſaith in <hi>Ezekiell,</hi> that he will take away from his children their old hearts and giue them new; and write his law in them, that they may ſee the excellent things and wonderful which are contained therein: which others do not. So that, although the vnbeleeuers and vnregenerate may haue knowledge in the letter;<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28.</note> yet are they not led after it by the ſpirit which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the life of it. For what will not hope of promotion, liuing and credite doe, euen with naturall men, in drawing them to take paines to ſeeke for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; as experience in all ages hath and doth teach? when yet, for any great matter of ſound practiſe &amp; comfort that many of them haue by the ſcriptures beſides, it is not worth the ſpeaking of. For when by ſtudy and learning they haue gotten the wealth and glory of this world, they haue that which they ſought: and as for the ſcriptures and the power of godlineſſe,<note place="margin">Pſ. 50.16. 2. Tim. 3.5.</note> though they haue a ſhew of it, their hearts tell them, that they are not the matters which take them vp in the delight of them, for they hate to be reformed by them; neither are they ſo precious in their eies, as that which they haue gotten by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> them, though it be but baſe and temporary.</p>
               <p>Whereas the word of God that reuealeth his will about all theſe,<note place="margin">Pſ. 19.10. Pſ. 119.35.</note> is more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſweet to his ſeruants, then the hony combe; yea, all the pleaſures of the world are not in their account to be compared to the wiſdome thereof:<note place="margin">Pſ. 119. part 2.</note> but that which is ſaid of the man of God, That he had more pleaſure in the word of god then in al maner of riches, and that they were the ioy of his hart, his matter of ſong and his companions to talke &amp; ſolace himſelfe with; it is far from them.<note place="margin">Pſ. 1.2.

               </p>
               <p>And is not this a roiall gift then, that whereas mens hearts naturally can take no pleaſure in the heauenly Manna of Gods word, but ſoone loath and waxe weary of it; that Gods people who know the price of it,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119 54. Pſ. 119.77. &amp; Pſ. 16.3.</note> may make the ſame their ſong, their ioy and their delight: that ſo they may draw out of it all good things as they haue opportunity? Which ſeeing others cannot doe, therefore they ſeeke vaine delights to pleaſure in, and that which miniſtreth
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:16851:296"/>
found delight indeed, they can in their greateſt need and heauineſſe haue no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> benefit by it.</p>
               <p>And through this knowledge and delight that they haue in the ſcriptures, which certify them of all theſe heauenly prerogatiues, they get experience in themſelues of the things which they leame therein, what is the happieſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of life that heere can be inioied,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.8.</note> euen that, which hath the promiſes of this life and of that which is to come.<note place="margin">Mat. 5.18.</note> They grow wiſe in obſeruing, that God verifieth indeed all that he hath ſpoken in his word, and not a iotte thereof doth faile; and therefore they become more reſolute euery day againſt all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and ſinne,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119.101.</note> becauſe they ſee that God will be reuenged vpon euery euill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> way; and that it is certaine, if they ſinne as others doe, he ſmiteth: and they grow to ſee,<note place="margin">Pſ. 89.31.</note> that he keepeth promiſe towards his, who reſt on him, euen in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> their greateſt ſtreights. Which how great a benefite it is, may be gathered by this, that it bringeth moſt neare communion with God by his ſpirit, which worketh in them (and which the world cannot receiue) as our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>He that loueth me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 14.21.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall be loued of my father, and I will loue him, and will ſhew my ſelfe vnto him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>He that keepeth my word, as he ſhall be loued of my father, ſo we will come to him, and abide with him:</hi> whereby he meaneth, that he will make knowen his minde and will to them as familiarly, as they which vſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe one with another, and eate and drinke together: for the which cauſe alſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> he calleth them his friends, which doe the things which he commandeth them, as to whom he will open euen his ſecret, as men vſe to doe to their friends,<note place="margin">Pſ. 87.2.</note> and not to ſeruants. For he loueth <hi>Zion</hi> (his militant church which he hath choſen, and will dwell there and delight in her) more then all the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that is, then all other beſide it.</p>
               <p>And what fruite this neare communion with God doth bring, which his faithfull ſeruants haue offered them, it may eaſily be coniectured; becauſe, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith:<note place="margin">Prou. 18.24.</note> 
                  <hi>The heart of a friend resteth in his friend; and a friend is nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer than a brother:</hi> and if the perfection of loue be ioy, there muſt needs be great ioy to Gods faithfull people, when they are ſo deare to the Lord and he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> beloued of them ſo intirely. Therefore, as God giueth to his, many comforts, and that alſo he doth many waies,<note place="margin">Luc. 10.20. Iohn. 16.24. 2. Cor. 1.12.</note> and in many reſpects, through the hope of eternall life, through true praier, and by a good conſcience (as hath beene ſaid:) ſo, in that they know his will and haue proofe of his familiarity with them, (as it pleaſeth him to call it) their ioy is yet more increaſed, eſpecially after a longer continued acquaintance with the Lord in his word. And what is happineſſe (ſuch I meane as in this preſent life may be inioied) if this be not; namely, to partake all theſe with him? thus to goe in and out before the Lord, and to haue him thus the ſtaffe of our comfort in al eſtates? Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ready to die and fit to liue, and giueth greater gaine in both, then in any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> other condition or courſe can be found and inioied: yea this maketh the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioiers of it happy heere, and certaine, that afterwards they ſhall be happy for euer; and though ſathan doth much quaile this by occaſion of troubles and our frailties, yet it is certaine, that it ſhall be recouered againe.</p>
               <p>This in few words is that which I wiſh the true Chriſtian reader to meditate on and conſider, which all Gods people haue ſo great need to inioy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:16851:296"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> by faith, as it muſt needs grieue all that doe vnderſtand and loue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of it, to ſee ſo many to be void thereof, to whom yet the Lord hath graciouſly and freely bequeathed it. And I pray God in moſt feruent maner, to inlarge the hearts of all his good ſeruants, that ſeeing many mourne in <hi>Sion,</hi> and are holden downe with ſundry and ſore afflictions till they faint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, (as though there were no comfort to be found for them, to the eaſing of their heauy hearts) that they may conſider what the Lord hath prouided for the eaſing of them, euen this: to beleeue, that all the forementioned priui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledges belong vnto them: that though their ſorrowes be many and great, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> they may not driue them from hope in God, but ſend them more earneſtly to grone to him by praier, that they may receiue and take theſe things to their comfort, which he for that very cauſe hath committed to writing; that thoſe his children which are brought low, and into diſtreſſe, and almoſt to vtter deſpaire, may lift vp their heads, and reioice for ſo great hope of redemption and deliuerance at hand comming towards them.</p>
               <p>And this will recompence, aboundantly all the labour that hath beene taken, and need no more be loſt when it is once inioied. And therefore if the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers may know by Gods word, that they haue a part in all the forementioned prerogatiues, and therefore delight in his word which bringeth ſuch tidings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> to them; if they may thereby be made acquainted with that maner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation which pleaſeth God beſt, and maketh moſt for their owne comfort, and by his ſpirit may haue communion with him (which the world cannot haue:) I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude (I ſay) that the beleeuers haue great prerogatiues bequeathed them, and that the priuiledges which God hath granted out vnto his beloued, are moſt precious, and worthy all labour and trauell to be come by.</p>
               <p>And that I ſay no more of this, it is no hard matter to conceiue, what ſweet conſolation a beleeuing heart inioyeth which hath experience of this: for he beleeuing the promiſes of theſe things, from day to day, and hauing moſt ſweet peace of conſcience with confidence, as a fruite of beleeuing them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> how great muſt his comfort needs be, which ariſeth from both, and eſpecially for the hope which he hath of that which is yet to come?</p>
               <p>Oh that all who feare God did beleeue this, as they may boldly and ought confidently to doe, that they might inrich themſelues by hauing their part in it from time to time.<note place="margin">All theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent priuiledges as they may, ſo they ſhould be knowen by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</note> So that nothing is more to be lamented in the world then this: that God hauing called men to be partakers of ſo excellent priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and appointed for them ſuch varietie of bleſſings, (whereof I haue mentioned but ſome part) that they ſhould be ſo ignorant, as not to deſire to know them; ſo careleſſe as to reiect them; ſo obſtinate as to tread them vnder foote: and ſo to lead a life (I may truely ſay) full of miſery for want of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> But whiles I ſet downe this, me thinkes I heare ſome obiecting thus:<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> How can we be perſwaded that God hath prouided this liberty for his in this world,<note place="margin">Pſ. 126.5.</note> when both Scripture calleth our life heere (when we be in greateſt proſperity) a wandring vp and downe heauily, as in a pilgrimage or wilderneſſe? and a ſowing in teares, that is to ſay, full of griefe? and Chriſt telleth his, that in the world they ſhall finde tribulation, and that by many afflictions and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we muſt enter into his kingdom?

For all of vs muſt needs faint, if we did not confidently beleeue, that he ſetleth our hearts in moſt ſound ioy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; partly by the teſtimony of a good conſcience, which is a continuall feaſt, and an experience of his fatherly loue towards vs; and partly through the daily ſucceſſe and bleſſing which we looke for from him, the hope where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maketh vs not aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſeeing God of his vnſpeakable loue hath bequeathed to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo large a portion, euen a taſte of the heauenly ioies in this life, which maketh his chaſtiſements ſweet, and the yoke of his commandements eaſie vnto them, and all difficulties to be ouercome of them, and poureth ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> great peace and comfort into their hearts that loue him, and this from day to day, reſtrayning them of it at no time (except it be more expedient for them to want it:) what ſhall I ſay more, but bewaile that ſo few finde it; and pray God to inlarge their hearts, that they may be able to comprehend, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it, and to giue all praiſe to his maieſtie, who hath thought no heauenly comfort too good for his, euen in this world, which is a vale of miſery?</p>

As I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> nothing doubt, but whatſoeuer ſhew of reaſon may come in the way againſt it, ſhall be ſeene to be but the froth of mans braine, and carnall. And I likewiſe hope, that ſuch as ſhall be acquainted with the doctrine before ſet downe, ſhal not onely be incouraged by theſe anſwers to practiſe it, but alſo inabled and perſwaded to continue therein till more light be giuen them for the well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning of themſelues, and that in a more perfect maner than I can ſet downe: in the meane ſeaſon, that this which I heere haue propounded, may helpe to direct the common ſort of Chriſtian people, as the godly learned haue bene taught of God to direct themſelues. For who knoweth not this, that euen many of Gods deare children doe and haue through ignorance and for want <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> of direction, very dimly ſeene into the beauty of a godly life, and vncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blely gone about it, and haue made a meere toile of the ſeruice of God, which ſhould be the greateſt pleaſure? Therefore as it is not to be doubted, but that numbers will rebell againſt the doctrine which rangeth them within holie compaſſe, and will refuſe to be ſubiect to it; and that they which doe ſo, will frame their iudgement to their practiſe, to excuſe and defend that to be good which they doe; and beſides, there is no doubt, but that queſtions will ariſe in

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd firſt, if any doe maruell why I write any direction at all as though God had not ſet downe in the ſcripture a way for vs all to walke in: to this I anſwere, That if that were a good reaſon why no helpe for mens weakeneſſe ſhould be ſet forth in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe it is the ſame which is in the ſcripture; then it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> ſhould follow with as great reaſon, that nothing ſhould be preached, becauſe all that which is preached (if we preach in the name and by the authority of God) is out of the ſcripture. But ſeeing there can be no doubt made of that, &amp; therfore that both preaching &amp; writing are ſingular gifts of God for the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of his church; &amp; that al helps are not enough to hold vs on ſtill in our Chriſtian courſe: therefore all men ſee that this doubt is ſoone anſwered, &amp; will grant, that it is neceſſary to haue daily direction for our liues drawen out of the ſcriptures, though we haue them extant among vs. This being ſo, I will proceed to ſhew the cauſe, why I haue taken in hand any ſuch thing in this booke: and will anſwere particular queſtions and obiections afterwards. I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> haue conſidered,<note place="margin">The cauſe why this worke was taken in hand.</note> being conuerſant among the people, of whom, many haue receiued the goſpell gladly, what great wants and infirmities are among them: and as diuerſe of them conceiue and vnderſtand that which is taught them with much adoe; ſo they as hardly keepe it in memory, and therefore make the leſſe vſe of it. So that, although all things neceſſary to ſaluation and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, be taught one time or other, where an ordinary miniſtery is; yet, as I
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:16851:299"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> haue good proofe, it muſt be a very long time to bring the moſt part, euen of the forwarder ſort, to be able to guide themſelues, and to lay together in one ſumme thoſe things, which haue beene taught them at many times: I did therefore indeauour my ſelfe, to lay before them a ſumme of that in one view, which they haue bene learning many yeeres: that they hauing the ſame brought into ſome eaſie and familiar kinde of order, may through the bleſſing of God finde helpe and eaſe by it.</p>
               <p>And beſides, I haue knowen many of great forwardneſſe and ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any profitable leſſons,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 3.4.</note> (euen as the Theſſolonians were) who hauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> long wandered in ſorrowfulneſſe of heart, and found much vntowardneſſe in their life, haue complained bitterly; wiſhing moſt willingly,<note place="margin">Many for want of direction, walke vnſetlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> that they might haue found ſome direction to lead them into their way, and to hold them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in the ſame. And this they haue done, for that they were ſo ſoone vnſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and waxed looſe hearted in a ſmall time and ſhort ſpace, although a little before they felt themſelues in ſome good caſe, euen ready and willing to ſerue God: which men being directed how to keepe conſtant, ſhall not a little be eaſed. And if you will ſay, They may heare their preachers and ſo learne to ſtay themſelues: who doth not know, that they muſt proceed in their teaching as occaſion is offered by their text; which doth not fall out commonly ſuch or in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſuch maner to be handled, that it ſatisfieth thoſe which be in this caſe, being parhaps but touched briefely? and though it doe ſomewhat comfort them which they heare, yet it abideth not by them, through forgetfulneſſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions; and yet there are very many that neuer heare any ſuch thing taught them at all, or to very ſmall purpoſe: and therefore if ſuch may haue ſomewhat lying by them, to guide them in that their ſo great neceſſity, ſhall it not be (thinke we) great helpe and contentment to them?</p>
               <p>Now if you aske,<note place="margin">Men loth to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their griefs.</note> why they doe not open their caſe and make their griefe knowen to their teachers: I ſay, ſome of them are aſhamed, ſome are affraid to ſhew their eſtate to others, the diuell holding them in ignorance and diſtruſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Againe, many of their miniſters, to whom they may haue acceſſe, either for want of knowledge, or of experience, or both, are not able; and others of ill conſcience are not willing to reſolue them, nor ſtay their mindes, but wound and vex them with mocks &amp; diſcouragements rather, (as the watchmen which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of (calling them fooles for medling with the ſcriptures: and this is the comfort which they finde at their hands.

               <p>And to ſpeake plainly, (if it be expedient to ſpeake thus: for the loue of Gods people conſtraineth me) I haue my ſelfe languiſhed long,<note place="margin">The Authors owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

By the which whatſoeuer I haue attained vnto, I will not ſay, but I dare warrant the carefull and faithfull obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of it (the Lord being true of his word,<note place="margin">Great gaine of the direction.</note> who bleſſeth the meanes, which are vſed in ſimplicity) that his labour in the practiſe of it, ſhall be plentifully recompenced, yea his gaine by many degrees ſhall be greater then his trauel.

               <p>I haue ſpoken much of the priuiledges of a godly life, though no tongue of Angels can ſufficiently ſet out the ſame: yet many (no doubt) of good hope haue not found it ſo,<note place="margin">Priuiledges not inioied without ſuch direction.</note> for that they haue had but weake helpes to ſet them forward, in hauing their part in them, but are ignorant rather of the variety of

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> the good things, which God hath prepared for them that loue him, and therefore their faith and comfort are weake, when yet their diſcouragements and hinderances haue beene ſtrong and many. Theſe at ſome time haue felt the fauor of God ſhed into their harts, that they might not turne from him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together: but if they haue not attained to ſome good order and ſetled courſe to direct themſelues by, they muſt needs taſt the more of the corruption of the world, be the more in ſubiection to their rebellious affections, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the leſſe feele the benefit of a Godly life.</p>
               <p>For from whence are there ſo many heauineſſes, complaints of vnſetlednes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> inconſtancy, yea &amp; halting with God, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence in great part, that they do quench the worke of Gods ſpirit in themſelues, &amp; cannot tel how to quicken vp themſelues againe, nor to ariſe when they are fallen, &amp; to return when they are gone out of the way, nor to guide themſelues from one duty to another?</p>

The husbandman cannot yeeld his rent, nor reape his yearely harueſt without his daily and continued labour: neither can the captaine mainteine warre againſt his enemie except he renue his band, and cauſe daily attendance to be giuen by the ſame, and neceſſary prouiſion to be in a readineſſe; and ſo I may ſay of the reſt. In like maner, the Chriſtian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> looke to continue faithfull vnto the end, if he ſet not himſelfe of purpoſe to continue daily his diligence in reſiſting his ſinne, and if he gather not dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrength, by the continuance of ſome good meanes againſt the euils there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Inſomuch, that if a man had all the knowledge that many men haue, and ſhould be ignorant of no neceſſarie point of dutie: yet if he ſhould not with a well ordered minde, prouide and carefully looke for the right vſe of his knowledge euery day, as he ſhall haue occaſion to practiſe it; he might quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:16851:301"/>
be too farre gone out of the way in ſome groſſe diſhonouring of God:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which though it doe not pricke and wound them by and by, yet a time will come, when he ſhall wiſh he had borne the yoke of Chriſt, and kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe; for the end of a thing is not like the beginning.</p>
               <p>If any ſhould thinke me vnaduiſed to call in this earneſt manner, for daily directing of men priuately,<note place="margin">Though pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like meanes be of an excellent vſe, yet priuate neceſſary.</note> as though I ſet little by, or made ſmall account of the helpes which they haue in publike aſſemblies; I haue ſaid before, that I preferre theſe before the other: yet it may pleaſe them to vnderſtand, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the benefit of them, which is very great and ſingular, euery man ſhall finde it more then neceſſarie, that they be not idle nor vnprofitable at home <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> about the well gouerning of themſelues in the ſeuerall and manifold affaires of the day; and yet ſhall not this be any derogating from the other, but the fruite of it, euen as neceſſary for the ſoule, as to haue a daily good diet and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary for the body although it haue a feaſt once in the weeke. This I haue ſpoken generally hitherto, to perſwade many that feare God, (and yet for want of knowledge doe ſerue God very vncerteinly, and ſee not therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and price of the eſtate that he hath called them vnto) that he hath not left vs ſo deſolate and ſtranger-like from him heere on earth, that we ſhoulde but ſeldome thinke of or heare from him;<note place="margin">We are not left as ſtrangers to heare ſeldome from God, but to walke with him.</note> but ſhould haue daily recourſe to him, and throughout the day be with him, and not as the wandring man, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> hath loſt his way, ſo to be at any time out of his gouernment. And that it is not onely his pleaſure, but alſo his commandement, that we ſhould ſo liue in the world, and ſo haue to doe in it, that yet all the day long (as our frailtie doth permit) we may haue our meditation on him, and on our happineſſe in conuerſing and walking ſtill with him.</p>
               <p>If this ſtate be thought too preciſe by ſome; let them conſider the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of thoſe who are commended in the Scriptures for their conſtant walking with God:<note place="margin">

Alſo they ſay: It were a ſtrange world to ſee men liue now after ſuch a ſort, and a bringing in of Monkery againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Theſe and ſuch like obiections although they proceed from very euill men, and are vttered of them with a ſcoffing ſpirit; yet for want of knowledge and due conſideration, they may be at the firſt, the thoughts of many ſimple well meaning men: for whoſe cauſe I will anſwere them, becauſe I would be loath to leaue ſuch in any doubts, which might trouble and hinder them. But they who obiect thus, might more iuſtly haue alledged other reaſons, why they thinke it ſo hard to keepe any ſuch daily direction: that is to ſay,<note place="margin">The true lets which hinder many from this courſe.</note> partly their owne ignorance, vnacquaintedneſſe with this courſe, &amp; vnableneſſe: and partly the taunts, mocks and other diſcouragements, which prophane and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men would perſue them with, who ſhould walke ſo vnlike other men of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the world, by the practiſing heereof.

               <p>And ſuch examples this preſent age of ours (God be praiſed) doth affoord, (he vouchſafe to multiply the number of them, for one an hundred) who do ſo paſſe through the affaires of this world, that the Chriſtian life is vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not in word (as it is with many which deceiue themſelues) but indeed and ſenſible <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> account, daily their chiefe treaſure. And all that I require is no more, but that faith and godlineſſe may be continued &amp; increaſed in the beleeuers: and that they prouide (for the ſame purpoſe) that though the malice of the diuill doth lay many lets in their way,<note place="margin">1.

And for proofe heereof, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> may vnderſtand, that the Holy Ghoſt giueth the very contrary ſentence and iudgement of this matter. For whereas this right ordering of our liues, or framing them to obey Gods commandements, is the greateſt wiſdome, euen greater then that of the aged,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119.99.100.

For if it muſt needs be graunted, that it is good at ſome time; then it followeth, that the oftner and more vſually it is kept ſo, it is ſo much the better. And if it be the greateſt pleaſure of all other,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> to haue our hearts and conuerſation with God ſome one houre in the day: then by many degrees is it the greateſt pleaſure, if we can by any good dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction obtaine it for the moſt part,<note place="margin">Deut. 12.18. &amp; 19.</note> or throughout the day. Agreeably to the which, that man of God, who was ſo well experienced in theſe matters, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119.14.</note> not of ſome one time of his life, but of ſome whole part thereof: <hi>I haue had as much delight and pleaſure in thy testimonies, as in all maner of riches.</hi> But you wil ſay: What is this to proue, that he was thus minded through the day? He ſpeaketh (I ſay) of his daily courſe in ſuch places; as it is eaſie enough to ſee,<note place="margin">Pſ. 119.97. ver. 23. &amp; 10.</note> according to that which I alleadged before: <hi>All the day long is my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thy law,</hi> that is, (as he expoundeth himſelfe elſewhere) caſting and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> pondering in his minde, how he might keepe and might not breake it, nor wander out of the way from the direction of it. And who ſo hath any practiſe of his knowledge and experience, what reward there is in ſeruing God, doth clearly iuſtifie this to be true.</p>
               <p>For wherefore doth the godly Chriſtian take order to haue his recourſe to God by praier, meditation, reading, when he can haue opportunitie? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he fearefull of ill company, and deſirous of good? why dareth he not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion himſelfe after the world in their common prophane delights? why is the holy aſſembly of Saints moſt deſired of him; but becauſe it is the pleaſure, which he ſeeketh aboue other? when no man doubteth, but that he hath both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> leaſure as well as other, and occaſions enough offered him to the contrarie, if he found not greater delight in this courſe then any other, or if there were not pleaſure in the Chriſtian life;<note place="margin">Pſal. 88. Heb. 10.33. &amp; 11.24.</note> and ſo the more Chriſtian-like, the more pleaſure. Why would the beſt Chriſtians in all ages, ſuffer mocks, reproches, diſpleaſure of their friends and betters, loſſe of their goods and other liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and in ſuch times and places as their profeſſion hath beene purſued with impriſonment,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.24.</note> baniſhment, yea, and death it ſelfe; goe vnder all with free choice, rather then to inioy all other pleaſures of ſinne, as other haue done?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">This is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to all:</note>Indeed I graunt, that this is not pleaſure vnto all: neither is that to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> of me; but that it is a pleaſure to thoſe which loue the Lord, &amp; no toile to be conuerſant with him in one part of their life or other all the day long; and that with delight it may be aimed at, as at a marke, that they may pleaſe God in the things which they goe about, euen throughout the day, and may haue an eie to their actions which they doe,<note place="margin">But onely to the vpright in hart.</note> that they may not offend him: This vnto the vpright in heart is ſuch a pleaſure, as without it there is none to

And as for them which are not pure in heart, though indeed they pleaſe themſelues ſome way or other, yet their pleaſures are but paine: and though they follow a way that ſeemeth pleaſant; <hi>yet the iſſues thereof are the waies of death:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 14.12. &amp; 9.17.</note> Inſomuch that not onely <hi>ſtolne waters,</hi> which are commonly <hi>most ſweet,</hi> that is, vnlawfull liberties, are mixed with poiſon; but euen the pleaſures of wealth and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> which are things not vnlawfull, doe hold them out of Gods kingdome.<note place="margin">Math. 19.23.

               </p>
               <p>Thus it may appeare, that it is no weariſome thing to be ſetled in ſuch a courſe (wherein we may pleaſe God) as frailty will permit: but the ſound and chiefeſt pleaſure rather, yea and beſides, it is that onely,<note place="margin">Godlineſſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liberties.</note> which ſo ſeaſoneth our earthly and temporall liberties, that ſo they become lawfull and pleaſant to vs alſo; and the duties and works of our callings, that they be not (as to others) burthenſome and tedious. If all finde it not ſo, yet let the trueth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and let ſuch learne otherwiſe.

               <p>But another reaſon why this courſe is alleadged to be abſurd,<note place="margin">Godlineſſe no hinderance to our callings:</note> and inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, is this: that mens labours ſhould heereby be hindered, and their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings neglected; and ſo pouerty grow vpon the land, and many euils thereby: which where abſurd, and not to be ſuffered. To the which it may be anſwered, that godly thrift, and Chriſtian gaining, and lawfull proſpering in the world,<note place="margin">But the best way to thriue.</note> doe ariſe from hence: when a man doth ſo goe to worke in the world, and follow his dealings, that he be ſure, that he goeth about them with a minde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> which is at peace with God, and well ordered, that is, guided by him;<note place="margin">Note.</note> and when he doth faithfully and deuoutly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend himſelfe and his affaires euery day to Gods prouidence, and reſt therein quietly; &amp; when he doth as it were arme himſelfe with circumſpect heed-taking and wiſe regard, that he behaue not himſelfe prophanely in the world, nor after the maner of men, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is written: <hi>Whether we eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer we doe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.31.</note> 
                  <hi>doe all to the glory of God.</hi> And when for theſe purpoſes he ſhall reſolue with himſelfe, in the moſt conuenient ſort that he can, to begin the daie in ſome Chriſtian and godly maner, as I haue ſet downe in the daily direction, that all the reſt of the day following, he may ſauour of the ſame; he ſhall in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> doeing about the world, pleaſe God, and he ſhall alſo (as farre as God ſhall ſee it expedient) proſper in the ſame, as it is written:<note place="margin">Math. 6.33.</note> 
                  <hi>Firſt ſeeke the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, and other things ſhall be caſt vpon you.</hi> And this is the labour, which ſhould goe with religion. This ought Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to indeauour to come vnto: wherein although all which feare God, haue not a like meaſure of wiſdome and grace, yet let them all, wherein they want and be behinde in any part of duty, therein be willing to ſee their failings and

And thus carying themſelues, they ſhall haue much bleſſed experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods promiſes, in remembring, viſiting and caring for them ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: whereas on the other ſide, ſuch as riſe early and goe late to bed, breake their ſleepe often, and fare hardly and barely, (which ſort vſe moſt meanes to be rich,<note place="margin">Why many finde not Gods bleſſings on their labours.</note> and are moſt like to get the ſame) yet not attempting theſe things through Gods helpe, not vſually and oft crauing his grace and direction, not hauing their mindes ſeaſoned with piety and the feare of God, not being pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, ſober-minded, and watchfull againſt the euils which will meet with them,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> but prophane, raſh and worldly; cannot finde Gods bleſſing in their courſe. If they gaine and gather, they may (I denie not) flouriſh and proſper in the world a while; yet is all but as Iudas his ſoppe, and the Iſraelites quailes, to become bane and poiſon vnto them: the Lord hath heaped hoat coales vpon their heads, and increaſeth their damnation thereby the more ſwiftly; and oftimes,<note place="margin">Iam. 4.1</note> they are needy (that is, vnſatisfied) for all their ſhifts, &amp; therefore neuer the richer: and many of them poore indeed, putting their mony into a bottomleſſe purſe, and that although they toile for much, yet inioy nothing. Which kind of men prouide ill for themſelues many other waies, in omitting the chiefe duties which appertaine to them; for they fill their liues with much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> vnquietneſſe, frettings, impatience, quarrels, curſings and ſuch like: and when death commeth, (although they be little thought on in the meane ſeaſon) theſe things will grow to ſome hard reckoning: and in ſuch the prouerbe is verified, That though they be early vp, yet are they neuer the neare. For what pleaſure doth God take in their toiling, when they goe to it like ſwine, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, proceeding and ending in him, that is, by his direction?</p>
               <p>And whereas they apply another prouerbe in reproch to them which will firſt ſee God ſerued thus throughout their courſe, namely this: That the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt way about, is the neareſt way home, with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; they need not be aſhamed of it. For as the neareſt way doth not alwaies bring a man ſooneſt to his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> end, when he muſt goe ouer hedge and ditch, through mire and water: ſo they who goe roundly and directly to their earthly affaires and worldly dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,<note place="margin">Labour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeking firſt to God, is loſſe.</note> as ſoone as they are vp, and (as they ſay) from their bed to their buſineſſe, refuſing or omitting the daily duty of renewing their praiers, their purpoſes and care to liue godly; they may (I deny not) goe a nearer way then the other, but they doe nothing leſſe then attaine that which they ſeeke. For as all to whom I direct my ſpeech, are ſuch as would faine pleaſe God, as well as be maintained in the world; ſo they muſt looke for their ſucceſſe and bleſſing from him, and not from their owne labour, induſtry and wiſdome: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt daily ſeeke it at his hands by harty praier; and as they muſt not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> tempt him by neglecting paines and trauell, ſo they muſt not truſt to their labour alone: for ſo they declare, that to be all in all with them, whiles they make haſt to that, and let the principall goe.</p>

Whereas they ſay, it would be a ſtrange world, if men could be brought ſo farre from the corrupt and prophane faſhion of the common ſort, that they would ſubmit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> themſelues to a daily direction of their liues after the word of God: it is true indeed, that it would ſeeme ſtrange to thoſe which are contrarily minded; but that would make it neuer the worſe: for ſuch <hi>count it a ſtrange thing</hi> (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith) <hi>that other men runne not after the ſame exceſſe of riot that they doe:</hi>

               <p>

               <p>But I will proceed with other obiections which are yet behinde: among which, this troubleth many of Gods poore children, that they feare they ſhal neuer bring their harts to a daily courſe of Chriſtian walking, ſeeing they are ſo weake and haue ſo much to do in ſubduing ſome one vnruly affection. The peruerſe ſort obiect the ſame, who ſay they could like well, that men ſhould be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> taught a good order &amp; courſe, but in no wiſe can abide that it ſhould be daily &amp; continuall: and I haue in a maner anſwered it before. For what is that which they miſlike heerein?

               <p>But perhaps they will reply thus: We would ſometime pray or read by our ſelues, or looke to ſome other duties which God requireth, for the well gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our liues, when we muſt needs goe about our owne worke, or the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces buſineſſe, or ſuch like lets of one ſort or other call vs away, ſo that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not performe them: whereas they which are free from theſe outward buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſeruices, may take their libertie in theſe ſpirituall duties. But I aske this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> queſtion of them againe: Why they ſhould be moſt earneſtly bent to praier and reading at ſuch times, when they ſee other duties to be laid vpon them neceſſarily? Is it not becauſe they ſee they cannot doe them, that the deuill ſetteth them forward ſo hotly at ſuch a time to goe about them, that they may thinke themſelues to be godlier then they be, and ſo be deceiued?<note place="margin">Many be letted by lawfull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments:</note> And why are they not but euen halfe ſo feruent in going about reading, praying and other heauenly ſeruing of God, when they haue time and leiſure? Which if they be, it is well: let them reſt with peace therein, ſo ſhall they be the fitter to outward duties; and ſo doing, they muſt not count the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues letted, when they do that which is their calling: If they do not, let them wiſely marke how they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be blind-folded on both ſides; and make conſcience ſo to doe the one dutie in his ſeaſon, that the other be not counted an hinderance of them from the ſeruing of God, but be performed alſo, and that with cheerefulneſſe, when it lieth vpon them. And that which I anſwer in this one, I would haue to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all other of the like kinde of queſtions: and therefore heereof enough. Onely I thinke good to put them in minde,<note place="margin">When two du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties meet.</note> that when two duties meet together at one time, both being of great waight, that they pray God to
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:16851:307"/>
giue them diſcretion to conſider, which is moſt neceſſarie (alwaies following <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the light which God giueth them;) and in things indifferent, to do that which is moſt to Gods glorie, their owne peace and the benefit of their brethren.</p>
               <p>An other ſort there is, who are not troubled about this, yet haue another doubt which diſcourageth them very much from practiſing ſuch a Chriſtian courſe. For when they heare that there muſt not onely be appointed ſet times to pray and meditate, but alſo that in our going through the whole day, we muſt watch againſt euill, and euen in particular actions be circumſpect that we ſinne not againſt our knowledge, they aske whether they may not haue their mindes on their worke, while they are at it? If it be granted them, they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> aske how they ſhall doe both?<note place="margin">Holy exerciſes and lawfull bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe may ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> I ſay, no ſcruple is to be made of this, but that there ſhould be a minding, and that carefully, of thoſe things which we doe, though they be not ſpirituall: neither needed there be any queſtion made of this, but that they haue after the maner of carnall and worldly men, ſo fraught and ſtuffed their heads with earthly thoughts and worldly deſires, that they cannot vnburden themſelues of them, when they pray vnto God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he doth afterward giue them conſcience thereof and of other ſinnes, they are ſo grieued to remember their long continued offence that way, in that they were woont to fill their hearts with all ſenſuality and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, that now they thinke they diſpeaſe God, when they haue them ſet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> vpon their buſineſſe at all: euen as he that hath abuſed muſicke, myrth or meate dangerouſly, thinks afterward, that he may not vſe them in any ſort: whereas they may vnderſtand, that there is no ſuch diſagreement or contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie betwixt holy things and lawfull liberties, (neither therefore betwixt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall duties, and the workes of our calling) but that there maie be recourſe had from the one to the other, without quenching the gifts of Gods ſpirit in vs. And he that doth both of them in their ſeaſon, as becommeth him (I meane with a ſingle and honeſt heart) may worſhip God in praier, hearing his word, or any ſuch like, and not be diſtracted at the ſame time by earthly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> thoughts and fantaſies, ſo as they ſhould interrupt and breake him off: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the ſame man may be occupied in his earthly affaires and buſineſſe in ſuch wiſe, that he comming to them with a religious and well ordered heart, need not be diſtracted, vnſetled, or made vnfit thereby to other duties of Chriſtianity afterwards, nor any thing more earthly minded while he is at them. For why? euen they are the worke which God hath ſet him about: and therefore obeying him therein, he may be quiet, yea and chearefull: which God alloweth vs freely, if we could be wiſe to ſee and vſe our liberties to our good.<note place="margin">How the godly minde is occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in earthly dealings.</note> For a godly minded man, who hath taſted how precious and ſweet a thing it is, to keepe peace with God in all his waies, and hath experience how ſoone his heart is drawen into the world by the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne, will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> with ſuch faithfulneſſe keepe his affection knit vnto goodneſſe, as he knoweth he ought to do, that he is not drowned in the world, ſo ſoone as he is occupied in it, nor made drunke with the commodities of it (as men of the world are) ſo ſoone as he medleth with them; &amp; yet ſhal both thinke, talke &amp; deale about his worldly affaires as far as becommeth him.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it aboue all that is tranſitory and earthly.

had ouercome the world. When he told them, that few ſhould ſo like of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Chriſtian way,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.67.</note> that they would walke in it, did he giue them leaue to ſtay their courſe alſo?<note place="margin">Math. 7.13.</note> yea rather he ſtirred them vp to be the more earneſt themſelues to enter in at the ſtraight gate.

               <p>There are yet others, who thinke the labour to be but vaine which is taken in perſwading men heereunto: becauſe the moſt receiue not our counſell; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> and they which doe, take little good by it, onely they may in outward ſhew ſeeme to goe before others. To whom I anſwere: that as I looke not that the moſt men ſhould receiue it, ſeeing I direct it onely to the children of God,<note place="margin">Though moſt receiue it not, yet is it not in vaine.</note> who onely can vſe it, though others may repent and be aſhamed by it: ſo I doubt nothing, but that they which doe, ſhall be much helped forward by it to practiſe the godly life with more eaſe and readineſſe, vnleſſe they be ſuch as vſe it for faſhion and ceremoniouſly; as ſome which take themſelues to be the Lords, may do.

                  </note> that al which they doe, is vaine, and that they had beene as good neuer to haue entred at all into the profeſſion and couenanting of ſuch a courſe.

               <p>Beſides this, we haue yet another benefit by bringing our ſelues daily to conſider our waies:<note place="margin">Gaine by infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</note> that the infirmities and wants which we haue ſeene in our liues, doe both ſhew vs, that we haue ſtill matter ſufficient in our ſelues to humble vs, and to cauſe vs to be charitable rather then ſeuere iudges of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> bretheren; and alſo that we haue iuſt cauſe to continue our praiers to God, to pardon and weaken the ſame in vs more and more, reioicing that they pleaſe vs not, nor blindefold vs, ſo, as that we be made vnwilling to ſee them: and heereby we ſhall ſooner returne, if we haue broken off our courſe through ſome paſſion ouer-ruling vs for the time, then if we ſhould in a careleſſe and negligent eſtate, haue fallen after the ſame maner.

For as <hi>dead flies doe cauſe to ſtinke and putrifie the ointment of the Apothecarie</hi>:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.1.</note> ſo ſome ill parts of life and dead fruites mixed with commendable vertues, do ſpoile them of their vertue and beautie, that they haue no fauour in the ſight of God, neither giue they any ſweet ſmell or ſauour vnto men: and as the leauen though it be but a little, doth ſower and leauen the whole lumpe of dough; ſo ſome ſtrong corruptions being ſuffered to beare ſway in the life, doe corrupt euen that which otherwiſe would be good. For as it is a bleamiſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and deformitie in nature, to ſee in a mans body, one eie or legge ſmall and the other great: ſo if there be not proportion and agreeableneſſe in our liues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one part of it and another, it is an vtter deformitie in the whole.</p>
               <p>They thinke it harde to be bound, (they ſaie) to bring particularities of their liues vnder examination, and themſelues to be held within the compaſſe of anie ſuch rules, as ſhould debarre them of anie libertie which they ſhall thinke good for them: and that it were too fooliſh for them to thinke neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:16851:310"/>
and too ſeruile to obey &amp; follow them. But let them remember what they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſaid: that they are willing to do what duties they can; and then let them heare me:<note place="margin">Liberty to ſinne, dangerous.</note> what ſeruitude it is, I lately ſet down; that is, only a ſtopping of the courſe of fleſh and our owne corrupt will and affections: the which yet if we liue after,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> we <hi>ſhall die,</hi> and be cut off from our inheritance with God and with Chriſt. Indeed by theſe meanes, we ſhould bridle many paſſions of pride, loftineſſe, ſwelling; and breake off many boiſterous outrages which riſe vp in vs, as wrath, frowardneſſe, heart-burning; and quench manie fierie darts of concupiſcence, vncleane luſts, and wantonneſſe; with other ſuch fonde and dangerous delights, which lead men to deſtruction; and cleare our liues,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſeaſon our tongues with Chriſtian talke, as well as clenſe our hearts. And is there any man which reioiceth in the name of a Chriſtian, who would haue his libertie in theſe euils? What did I ſay? libertie? nay, who would become a bondman (for to ſpeake properly and truely, that is bondage in the higheſt degree) to his owne intemperate affections and deſires? As for the varietie of good liberties,<note place="margin">We may vſe all good liberties.</note> which our moſt mercifull God hath betruſted vs with, which are both manie and comfortable in themſelues, we may vſe them all in the Lord, ſo that God haue his honour thereby: but whiles we take our part in them, the Lord may not loſe his part due to him; in a worde, whiles we vſe them ſoberly, and with care not to offend, and that nothing be done againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> knowledge and peace therein. And is not this ſufficient and enough for all men which are the Lords? I am ſure when men cannot be content to keepe themſelues at this ſtaie, as they pay dearely for euery ſtolne libertie, ſo they muſt ſay, when they haue had their mindes ſatisfied, after all: The godly life excelleth; and ſing the dolefull ſong of them who haue learned it ſomewhat too late by their wofull experience; that Meaſure is a treaſure: when their mirth is at an end. For doe we not ſee, that when Chriſtians haue walked in a good courſe for a time; and after, haue begun to ſhake off the yoke of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and haue againe ſought libertie to the fleſh, alledging this: What? muſt we be alwaies pent in, to looke to our waies? ſee we not (I ſay) that God hath <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> in ſome houre or day,<note place="margin">Falles of good Chriſtians by boldneſſe.</note> giuen them vp into their owne hands, in haſte and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to run with greedineſſe to the fulfilling of their hearts deſire which they haue ſought? and in that one houre to lay a foundation of ſorrow for many yeeres after? But haue they afterwards in like haſte and with eaſe returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? Nay, then they muſt haue ſhewed themſelues wiſer than ſome, who were wiſe: and more ſtrong than <hi>Sampſon</hi> the ſtrongeſt in his time; who after he had proſtituted &amp; made himſelfe a ſot and ſlaue to a baſe miſtreſſe, recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not himſelfe againe, vntill he had ground in the priſon like an horſe, both his eies being put out, and ſeruing to make the vncircumciſed paſtime, who had beene the ioy and glory of the people of God. But to returne from <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> haue they not tried what it hath gained them, to be at their owne hand and libertie, whiles they haue thereby runne into ſhamefull ſinnes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?

and fewer lets (who for the moſt part haue their liuing prouided them, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> may be much more free (as they ought to be) from earthly intanglements, than others, except they loue to haue their hands and their heads ful of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealings:) ſo they haue more dueties to performe beſides theſe, which are common to all priuate Chriſtians. For they ought not to reſt in the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aforeſaid,<note place="margin">Miniſters and ſuch like ſhould moſt tend this.</note> which is common to euery priuate beleeuer: but according to their ſpeciall calling, as they are miniſters, they ought to performe the ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dueties thereof publickly and priuately, both by attendance to reading themſelues, and alſo as watchmen to looke vnto others diligently, in exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.3.</note> admoniſhing, rebuking, comforting and inſtructing them, as occaſion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſhalbe offered.</p>

This (I ſay) and ſome other ſuch dueties ought to be looked to of ſuch: ſo that priuate perſons need not thinke themſelues ſo ſore preſſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them; who if they looke well to their charge, haue a double duetie to diſcharge in reſpect of others.

For though the calling it ſelfe be moſt glorious and fit to make and keepe them heauenly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> minded, namely, ſeeing their labours and ſtudies may be helpers of them to godlineſſe, whereas other mens are full of toile, and occaſions (through their weakeneſſe) to draw them to worldlineſſe: yet except they be ſuch themſelues, as haue the vpper hand ouer their mindes and hearts, and can hold them in ſubiection, and teach themſelues when they teach the people, their ſtudies will not onely be full tedious vnto them, and yeeld ſmall profit to their flocke; but alſo they ſhall be as apt to be deepely plunged in the world, and in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vanity, as others: which will ſurely come to paſſe, till preaching, reading and godlineſſe be with a better conſcience regarded of them, and till it be their glory &amp; crowne to ſeeke to gaine many to God.<note place="margin">1.

And as for ſuch as are more painfull in their calling, &amp; carefull in their life to pleaſe God, though it muſt be granted, that they haue many more helps in regard of their miniſtery, then priuate men; yet it is alſo to be conſidered,
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:16851:311"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that their troubles and croſſes are manie more &amp; greater then other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are for the moſt part;<note place="margin">Good ministers many troubles. <hi>Luc. 22.31. 2. Cor. 6.9.</hi>
                  </note> for they are more ſhot at by Sathan and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they haue many diſcouragements, vnkindeneſſes offered them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for their good will and for the doing of their duty, as vnknowen though knowen, beſides their continuall care ouer the flocke of Chriſt.

Therefore let none obiect, that the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (except ſome few whom God doth more ſpecially priuiledge, for cauſes beſt knowen to him) becauſe of their calling may eaſily keepe a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant courſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in the feare of God, as though they had no lets nor diſcouragements: but let them knowe, that all haue hinderances enough: and therefore according to the helpes, which God hath giuen to euery one, both miniſter and hearer, let them grow thereby, and one not looke vpon another to be cooled and held backe; but all cheare vp their mindes, and truſſe vp their corrupt thoughts, which are euer haling and carrying them one way or other,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Now as for them which will not miſlike the counſell that is giuen them in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> this direction, if they could follow it:<note place="margin">Practiſe of this.</note> but they thinke the writer heereof to haue wiſhed better to other, then he can follow himſelfe: let them yet weigh &amp; take in good part his loue to them herein, whatſoeuer it haue profited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and yet though he will ſay nothing of himſelfe, leſt any ſhould thinke of him otherwiſe then he ſeeth or knoweth to be in him, yet he can put them out of doubt, that this doctrine hath beene receiued, and conſcionably practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of ſome, euen priuate Chriſtians to their good contentation,<note place="margin">This hath beene prooued profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> and (as they are perſwaded) to the plentifull recompence of their labour therein beſtowed, euen already: who yet haue good hope, that the firſt attempting of it was, as the hardeſt to them, ſo the leaſt gainfull, in compariſon of that which is to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> looked for; and that the beſt is to come. And that the certaine fruit, which they haue reaped of the practiſing it, in ſuch weake maner as they could attaine vnto, in reſpect of the vncertaine profit and comfort, which they receiued of their vncertaine ſeruing of God, before they were acquainted with it; they confeſſe (as they be able to iudge) to haue beene very great. This I ſay for their better incouragement, into whoſe hands this booke ſhall come, that they may not feare, that this is thruſt forth at aduenture amongſt men, when no proofe hath beene taken, how it hath wrought vpon any before.</p>
               <p>And yet this is no ſmall benefit,<note place="margin">Singular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of this courſe.</note> (whatſoeuer others haue done) that a man which deſireth to pleaſe God, may know how to behaue himſelfe in this pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> both towards God and men: how to proceed when he hath begunne: how to comfort himſelfe when he is heauy: how to raiſe vp himſelfe, when he is fallen: how to returne when he hath gone out of the way: which (through Gods bleſſing) with many ſuch fruits, he may finde heere, and inioy daily to his comfort: I ſay, heere; (yet without any arrogancy) becauſe though many good things may be reaped of many worthy mens labours, yet they haue not driuen at this one particular, Of daily directing a Chriſtian, as I haue done.
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:16851:312"/>
And this for the ſatisfying of thy demand concerning the practiſe of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> doctrine: and therefore feare not thou, that the Lord will leaue thee in the middle way, when he hath bleſſed thee in the beginning thereof, if thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweſt not thy ſelfe from his gouernment; but he will ſhew himſelfe farre more gracious to thee, according to the praier which <hi>Dauid</hi> made in faith to him,<note place="margin">Pſ. 71.9.</note> and obtained the fruite of it: <hi>O Lord thou haſt beene my hope euer ſince my youth: Caſt me not away in the time of mine old age: when my ſtrength ſhall faile, leaue me not.</hi> And as this holy man of God (we ſee) diſtruſted his owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet through his long experience of Gods fauour and kindeneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued aſſured hope thereof vnto his end: ſo the beſt of vs might iuſtly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> feare (knowing the malice and ſubtilty of our enemy, beſides our owne excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding frailties) that we ſhould neuer be brought in ſafety to our end; and crie out daily againſt the vnlikelihoods of continuance, which we ſee both in our owne liues,<note place="margin">Faith ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all doubts and lets.</note> and other mens.

               </p>
               <p>But yet one thing (ſeeing I ſpeaking of it before, did ſhut it vp too briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) remaines neceſſarie to be anſwered more fully. For when they heare the name of direction (though they who read the whole, may eaſily ſee what I meane thereby) they demaund thus: What? is there any other direction, then the word of God? And is that now at the firſt made our direction? But what Chriſtian hath not laboured to follow that in all ages, when no ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention as this, nor no ſuch new found out direction, as yee mention, was knowen? vnleſſe perhaps yee haue found out any new thing beſide the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or, you ſee that in the Scripture, which none before you ſaw. I anſwer, that neither doe I vrge any other then the word commands,<note place="margin">No other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection then Gods word.</note> nor arrogate no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> skill, to teach and guide mens liues, then other of my brethren, who do ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſcionably obſerue in reading the Scriptures, haue found out and do teach: and that is, That euery day the ſubſtance of godlineſſe ought to be practiſed of euery true Chriſtian; and that according to his knowledge, hee ſhould holily and religiouſly indeuour to make the ſame conſcience of his thoughts, words and deeds euerie day, which at any time or any day he hath done, when he looked beſt vnto them. And becauſe the rules of Gods word, &amp; practiſes of mens liues do not ſo commonly &amp; eaſily meet together; but euen among the godly it is much complained of, that they moſt hardly can faſten vpon a good courſe, and that euen the very knowledge of it, for want of plaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> and daily teaching, is in many places much wanting: therefore I ſay further, that the frailtie and weakneſſe of ſuch doth require, that there be ſome helpe miniſtred to them by ſuch as haue experience: and that which is ſufficiently taught in the Canonical Scripture, heere and there for the directing of them, had need to be gathered together both plainly and plentifully in one Treatiſe for them, to haue it at hand by them, and to read oft, as they ſhall be able, and
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:16851:312"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſhall ſee it neceſſarie: and not to ſend honeſt and well diſpoſed Chriſtians, to ſeeke for euerie inſtruction which they ſhall haue need of, to euerie booke and chapter of the Bible: which neither God doth inioine them, neither they could poſſibly finde, though they had leiſure, no not one of a thouſand, but are to be helped by the ſermons and writings of their teachers. For as no man will ſay, there is no vſe of the Apothecaries ſhoppe to fetch thence roots and hearbs for neceſſarie vſe, becauſe they grow in fields and gardens: ſo neither is the writing of particular treatiſes needleſſe, although all neceſſarie points of inſtruction are to be found in the Canonicall Sciptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> And as the ſermons of many haue bene penned to good purpoſe,<note place="margin">Chiefeſcope: How to liue holily alwaies.</note> to helpe ſuch as are well diſpoſed; ſome directing particularly how to praie; ſome how to receiue the holy communion; ſome how to faſt, &amp;c. ſo I haue laboured in this treatiſe to direct men how to liue in this preſent world, ſo as they may walke with God: euen by bringing them from a generall &amp; confuſed thought of Chriſtianitie to a daily and particular care of godlineſſe throughout their whole courſe. And ſeeing (as our Sauiour ſaith) <hi>The light of the body is the eie</hi>; ſo the light of the whole life, is the effectuall and powerfull knowledge of Gods will, and a well ordered heart, and gouerning of the vnruly affections: therefore I haue heerein declared how ſuch knowledge muſt be ſought, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the heart of a Chriſtian be daily gouerned in the cogitations and deſires of it, that they may draw the life in the ſeuerall actions and parts thereof vnto the obedience of Chriſt. Yet I denie not, but that men of experience, who haue long accuſtomed themſelues to the daily and true feare of God, may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect themſelues better, then that ſuch ſhould need to tie themſelues to theſe rules or ſuch like of another mans drawing; who if they haue learning, and doe keepe a daily obſeruing of their waies and affections, ſhall be beſt able thereby to gouerne and guide themſelues: of which ſort, I wiſh there were many, who could helpe forward other, rather then ſtand in need of helpe themſelues. But too few there are of them: for although many for their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> might, yet they doe not ſo narrowly looke to themſelues, how they obey that which they know, but that a direction drawne out of the worde of God by another mans labor &amp; induſtry, may do them good. Among whom, if there ſhould be ſome, who ſhall condemne this my writing as curious, (as there are many who cannot thinke any ſuch doctrine neceſſarie) I reſt in that which hath mooued me to take it in hand.</p>
               <p>The obiections which remaine, are in regard of the perſons and ſtates of men: as, the mightie and the meane, the ruler or magiſtrate, the poore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, labourer and workman, the traueller, or whoſoeuer he be, or in what ſtate ſoeuer, hauing his hands full of buſineſſe,<note place="margin">Lawfull calling and buſineſſe hindreth not this direction.</note> (ſo as his calling be allowed of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God, and profitable to men) that which hath beene anſwered to the former obiections, may fitly ſerue for them: Namely, that all being teachable, and ready to heare what the Lord hath to ſay to them, may ſerue God daily by walking diligently in their calling, and minding their worke whiles they be about it: ſo as they remember &amp; keepe this in firme perſwaſion,<note place="margin">Be perſwaded that thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt God in that which thou doſt.</note> that they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor &amp; take paine therein, becauſe it pleaſeth God they ſhould do ſo: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that they be watchfull to practiſe in their labours, all vertues, and bring

               <p>To be ſhort, euery true Chriſtian may as he ought, keepe a daily courſe of liuing holily, righteouſly and ſoberly, though not all in a like meaſure and degree, yet ſo, as God may be pleaſed, his owne heart quieted, and others by his example not iuſtly offended, but edified: which is the thing that we ought all to propound to our ſelues, and aime at. And laſt of all, whereas it may be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> demaunded, what ſicke perſons ſhall doe, and whether their conſciences ſhall be tied to ſuch rules, when paines and diſeaſes giue no libertie to the minde to thinke of anie thing but the greatneſſe &amp; extremitie thereof; and when praier it ſelfe, eſpecially long continued, cannot be admitted, no not of them who haue yet in their health praied oft and feruently, and with delight: to them I anſwer;<note place="margin">Direction for ſicke perſons.</note> That if the diſeaſes and kindes of paine be ſuch, (as there are manie ſuch) then know we that the direction fit for ſuch, is to keepe faith, hope, peace with God, and patience, with meekeneſſe and thankfulneſſe: to watch for this,<note place="margin">1.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus much I haue thought good to ſay of the doubts, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections and cauils which may be raiſed from or by occaſion of the former doctrine, as alſo of the anſwers therto. And now <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to ſhut vp this Treatiſe and the whole Booke, for concluſion, a few words in the way of exhortation I adde both to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and godleſſe: and ſo I end.

And ſuch of you, as haue knowen this point of trueth, and made conſcience of the ſame to practiſe it, I meane euery day, and throughout the ſame, to ſet your ſelues to walke with God, (which many and thoſe alſo well minded haue not done,) holde on your courſe and be not wearie of well doing; for yee ſhall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> reape the fruite thereof without wearineſſe:<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> yee haue borne the greateſt brunt already, while liuing among many Atheiſts, papiſts and carnall Goſpellers, yee haue receiued their liuerie and cenſure, and with all diſgrace that might be, (vnder the Goſpell) haue reprochfully had the odious names of Preciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Puritanes, Hypocrites and ſedicious perſons, giuen vnto you: but if taunts, mocks, reproches and diſcouragements haue not turned you out of the way, nor cauſed you to waxe faint in your Chriſtian courſe, neither let any other thing heereafter vnſettle you, but holde out the confidence of your faith, and reioicing of your hope vnto the end: and ſo doing, I pray God,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.6. 3. ep.

But to others of you, who feare God and know it to be your dutie to make conſcience of your waies one day as well as another, and yet did it not; or if you were ignorant of it, yet yee made no haſt to know more then yee did, leſt yee ſhould anſwere for more then yee were willing to doe:<note place="margin">Their ſinne is great.</note> the ſinne of both ſorts of you is great, and doth crie to God for puniſhing it, and he hath hard the crie of it againſt you, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> hath a controuerſie with you for it; as he ſaid in the ſame caſe to the church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reu. 2.4.</note> (though yet God was worſhipped truely of it, but not indeed with zeale, and feruently) <hi>I haue ſomewhat against thee.</hi> And that which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid to them,<note place="margin">Therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</note> I ſay vnto you: <hi>Remember from whence yee are fallen, and repent, and doe your former workes, or elſe God will come againſt you ſhortly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For indeed it is not meet, that ſuch as at the firſt inlightning of them by faith through the preaching of the goſpell,<note place="margin">To forſake our firſt loue, what.</note> could not ſatisfy themſelues in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thankefull to God for their deliuerance which they ſaw: ſhould after, make a common matter of Gods loue, and leaue their feruency in honouring him, and their firſt loue to him, which they thought ſometime could neuer be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> enough.<note place="margin">They ſmart who doe ſo.</note> And therefore it is not to be doubted, but that ſuch haue manie complainings of their looſeneſſe and ſecurity, and manie accuſings of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, when they ſmart for ſuch negligence and boldneſſe in ſinning againſt God, by ſuch corrections as he doth inflict vpon them. And to omit all other (for there is now no time to mention manie) euen this is one: that whereas manie of them, who while <hi>they walked vprightly, walked ſafely,</hi> yet ſince they waxed more wearie of Gods ſeruice, they were driuen manie times to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſtreights, complaining that they could not finde the comforts in Gods word and promiſes, which they were wont to inioy. And who doubteth, but that it muſt needs be ſo? For although ſome take diſcomfort without any iuſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> cauſe, either when they cannot doe the good they would, or when Gods hand is vpon them by ſome ſore afflictions; in which caſes their griefe ought not to exceed: yet that it doth ſo, when men walke not ſoundly with God, and follow not that which they know they ſhould, what maruell is it?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Amend, and that ſpeedily.</note>It is their wiſdome for both to amend, and that ſpeedily: the one, his error, that he knew not; but both of them, their careleſſe halfe-ſeruing of God which
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:16851:314"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> they had offered him, and to bring themſelues to this, that they hold and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it their greateſt worke they haue to doe, and the chiefeſt care, that they be affraid to offend continually and euery day: yea and for this cauſe, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen their <hi>reioicings be in trembling.</hi> This is that, which they muſt indeauour after. And to conclude my ſpeech to them,<note place="margin">More cauſe to looke to our ſelues then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</note> let this that I ſay be regarded the more, by how much they are in greater danger of the diuils deceiuable allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which now in this our renued peace and longer hope of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, they lie open vnto. Seeing it will be plauſible, not onely to the bad, but alſo to the better ſort, that now we haue eſcaped the perill which we feared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> when the yeares of our late deceaſed Soueraigne the Queenes Maieſty grew full, and therefore not like long to continue: now (I ſay) we hauing obtained of the Lord this mercie, to haue a religious and godly king to ſit vpon the throne, and to defend vs, it will ſeeme a needleſſe matter to looke ſo narrowly to our ſelues as then we did. But let all ſuch know (howſoeuer others haue no eares to heare it) that if, now our feare of earthly danger is taken away in ſome ſort, we increaſe not and double our feare of offending God;<note place="margin">Duble our care &amp; thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</note> and alſo if with more inlarged hearts we ſet not our ſelues daily (as we haue good cauſe) to teſtifie our thankſgiuing, by all poſſible fruites thereof, with honeſt and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe conuerſation: I doe them to vnderſtand,<note place="margin">Or elſe the end ſhall be worſe then the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Amos. 3.2.</hi>
                  </note> that the laſt end of theſe bleſſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> times will be worſe to them, then the beginnings of them were, when they had not yet ſo deepely ſinned: And it will be verified in them, which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the daies of the prophet <hi>Amos</hi> to the children of Iſraell: <hi>You onely haue I knowen of all the families of the earth, and therefore I will viſit you for all your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I haue ſpoken to the Godly, I turne to the other, who either haue onely a falſe perſwaſion of their ſaluation; or elſe, confeſſe that they haue no knowledge what ſhall become of them after this life. Both ſorts are earneſtly to be deſired, to conſider in what fearfull eſtate they be, who hauing not made ſo much as a beginning in the practiſe of a godly life (for ſo it may truely be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> ſaid, if they haue not true and vnfaigned faith) are farre off from this daily wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with God, which I haue ſhewed to be required by him of all his faithfull ſeruants. They are alſo to weigh, how they can anſwere this ſaying of the Lord Ieſus: <hi>Except yee repent, yee ſhall all periſh:</hi> And that of Saint <hi>Peter: If the righteous be ſcarcely ſaued, where ſhal the wicked &amp; vngodly appeare?</hi> For beſides that their eſtate ſhall be in the world to come, eaſeleſſe and remedileſſe, what is it that they deſire heere, for the which they can be content to debarre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the bleſſed immortality of the ſoule, and the glorious reſurrection of the body, and to goe to the place of torment? doe they not ſee the ſlippery and vncertaine condition of all things heere below? and that they cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> themſelues continuance in one eſtate till the next morning? and that they are (whatſoeuer they imagine) <hi>without God in the world,</hi> the vileſt of all creatures, the moſt curſed, except the diuils, and yet diuels incarnate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? And if they thinke they may repent when they wil, (beſide that late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is dangerous, if they might attaine to it) doe they not ſee, that they ſhut vp the way thereto from themſelues, whiles they may heare the lord ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus to them: <hi>Becauſe when I called vpon you, yee would not heare, you ſhall
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:16851:315"/>
cry your ſelues, and I will not heare ſaith the Lord?</hi> And if they ſhould perſwade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> themſelues, that their ſinnes are not ſo great: what is more ridiculous? And what ſhould I ſay more? For if it were but the depriuing themſelues of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite good things which are to be inioied euen in this life, they are worthily to be reprooued and chalenged by that ſpeech of Salomon,<note place="margin">Prou. 1.28.</note> 
                  <hi>O yee fooles, how long will yee loue fooliſhneſſe, and yee ſcorners delight in ſcorning, and yee vnwiſe hate wiſdome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as great folly it is, to hope that puniſhments and fearefull and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome times heere, ſhall paſſe as they haue done, euen like vnto a ſhower of raine. But as <hi>Noah</hi> told the people of the old world, that when God meant to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> bring the flood that ſhould couer the earth, it ſhould raine without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion forty daies and forty nights; which the people thought would not haue beene ſo,<note place="margin">Deſtruction commeth ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</note> but it did come to paſſe: euen ſo, when God will bring their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, it ſhall come ſwiftly as a whirlewinde, and conſume them vtterly, as the fire doth the ſtuble, before it make an end. And as <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> had twelue moneths granted him to repent in, but at the end of them, when he went forward in his ſinne, euen while he was priding himſelfe in his great Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, the ſame houre he heard Gods ſentence on him, and had it executed; that he was driuen from men, and did eate graſſe as the oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heauen, till his haires were growen as eagles feathers, and his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> nailes as birds clawes: ſo God will ſurely come and not delay, at his appointed time, and doe as he hath ſaid, to the ſonnes of men who are workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they ſhall not eſcape: and in the meane ſeaſon their damnation ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why God dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſo.</note>And why will God deale thus with them? Verily becauſe they by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their ſin, put him in minde of the iudgement threatned againſt them, to execute it: whereas a man would thinke, that ſo many examples both in ſcripture and in their owne experience, wherein they haue ſeene the fearefull execution of his threatnings after mens ſin hath growen to ripeneſſe, ſhould <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> driue them to preuent their owne deſtruction. And as none are without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings one time or other, and thoſe alſo feareful ones for the time, by ſickneſſe, diſeaſes, feare of death, wounded conſciences and other ſuch accuſations: ſo a man would thinke, in the time wherein they are ſent, that they would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſuch warnings while they liue,<note place="margin">Gods warnings ſoone forgotten.</note> and neuer forget them: but like a wonder that laſteth but nine daies, ſo is there repentance, which vaniſheth awaie as the dew of the morning by the heate of the day. I would haue thought my ſelfe, that many monſtrous perſons whom I haue viſited, when Gods wrath vpon them cauſed them to cry out, and promiſe amendment, would haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued rare examples to others, of true conuerſion to God; but to my great griefe, and to teach me experience what becommeth of ſuch vntimely fruites <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="K"/> they haue turned backe againe, as an arrow from the ſtone wall, and <hi>as the dog to his owne vomite</hi>: which cauſeth me to write that, which I haue often vttered with an heauy hart, That we had need to haue the doctrine of repentance ofter then any thing elſe, for that ſinne being rooted ſticketh ſo faſt. If we be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of any thing but ſinne, one warning will ſerue: but many hundred ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons cannot purge that out. For when they heare that which ſometime caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:16851:315"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> them downe, yet as though they had beene beſide themſelues while they were in ſuch good moodes, they come to themſelues againe, that is, to their old courſe, and ſay: Shall we forgoe our pleaſant life, our mery companie, our braue ſtomacks which make vs famous, and to be ſpoken of? yea the meaneſt haue ſomewhat to hold themſelues in, as it were in chaines, that they may not returne to God leſt he ſhould ſaue them.</p>
               <p>But now I haue ſhewed them their eſtate, euen their ſhame, and the woe which they are in, and what variety of ſpirituall and heauenly delights they haue forgone by refuſing to walke within the compaſſe of Chriſtian duty from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> daie to daie, (which ſweetneſſe of holy delights God giueth his ſeruants as a taſte of heauen in this life) what remaineth but this: that all (which will not ſhew themſelues deſperate, &amp; wilfully to ſeeke their owne confuſion) conſider this, though they haue long forgot God, and lay it to heart: namely,<note place="margin">Lay it to heart.</note> that they ſay with the apoſtles euerie one ſeuerallie, when Chriſt their maſter told them that one among the reſt ſhould betraie him: <hi>Is it I maſter?</hi> and with <hi>Paule,</hi>
