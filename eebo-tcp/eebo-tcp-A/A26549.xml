            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64416:7"/>
of a Desert once, and full of great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests. The first People that inhabited it were a Colony of <hi>Germans,</hi> which came out of their Countrey some time before the Birth of our Saviour, and it is from thence that it has the name of <hi>Batavia,</hi> if we believe the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, and particularly <hi>Tacitus, lib. de moribus Germanorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no doubt but the</hi> Batavi <hi>are the chief in strength and valour among the</hi> Germans, <hi>and that this Nation which was formerly called</hi> Cattes, <hi>and which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a sedition at home invaded these Islands which the</hi> Rhene <hi>makes, and are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Subjects of the</hi> Roman Empire, <hi>are the noblest portion of the</hi> German <hi>State, since History makes so much mention of them, and that it appears so in their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, customes, and manners, of which the chiefest are these following. 1. That they pay no tributes. 2. That they are free from all contribution towards the War. 3. That they are alwayes reserv'd for the War. 4. That they have the most honourable rank in the Army, as being esteem'd the best Souldiers, and the best skill'd in lancing their Javelots. 'Tis by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64416:7"/>
their help,</hi> sayes <hi>Tacitus, that the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>have extended their Empire beyond the</hi> Rhene.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> in truth did think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves happy to have them for friends and companions; not that I deny but that they were in some way conquered by the same <hi>Romans,</hi> whom they assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much in their Wars against the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> or <hi>English;</hi> witness the <hi>Brittain</hi> Castle built by the same <hi>Romans;</hi> for as <hi>Tacitus</hi> sayes, it was only by the force of the <hi>Batavi</hi> and the <hi>Tongri</hi> that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did overcome the <hi>Brittains:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Emperours were so convinced of their fidelity, that they us'd them as guards to their persons; but because the <hi>Romans</hi> did begin to oppress them, they revolted from them, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Tacitus</hi> in the fourth Book of his History, in these words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Batavi <hi>having been us'd in the Wars of</hi> Germany, <hi>did furnish the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with arms and men; their principall leaders were</hi> Julius Paulus <hi>and</hi> Claudius Civilis <hi>of the Royall Bloud;</hi> Paulus <hi>being accus'd of rebellion was kill'd, and</hi> Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius <hi>put in prison, but set at liberty by</hi>

                  </gap> Civiiis, <hi>being a man of parts, took notice of the disorder the Empire was in, and observing the natural aversion the</hi> Bataves <hi>had for the</hi> Romans, <hi>because that in raising of Souldiers among them, they aim'd more to satisfie their avarice and foul luxury, than to supply the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he fomented under hand at first their discontent, then appearing openly, exhorted them to recover their liberty, and cast off the yoke of slavery.</hi> We are not, <hi>said he,</hi> treated like companions, but like slaves; remember the glory of your Ancestors, and look upon the disorders of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the <hi>Gaules</hi> your neighbours, who will joyn with you in the design of recovering your liberty. <hi>Thus it appears by this Writer that the</hi> Batavi <hi>were to have been the</hi> Romans <hi>companions, and that it was for the breach and non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that promise that they revolted, and maintain'd a bloody War, in which were perform'd many noble actions.</hi>

to mercy, but with very infamous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions for them, by the advice of one of his counsellors, who was afterwards banished <hi>Flanders,</hi> for being the author of so severe a proceeding.

                  <p>This so much afflicted the Emperour, that he was divers daies before he would be seen in publick; and it is thought that from that time forward, he fram'd the design of resigning his Crown.

I have spoke a little more at large of the actions of this Prince, than our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod bears, for two reasons; First, Because he is the author of many fine Laws and Constitutions, which are to this day observ'd in <hi>Holland.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Because his memorie is yet in great veneration amongst these Nations.</p>
                  <p>Some of the Citizens of <hi>Utrect,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving carried themselves very insolently towards him, he patiently endur'd the affronts, that he might give an example to other Princes, how they are bound to observe themselves, the Laws they lay upon their people; though in this case it were not he, but one of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that was in fault. It is said that he gave the Citizens of <hi>Utrect</hi> this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that their estates should not be confiscated, though their persons were executed, and that for what crime so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but that their heirs may enjoy it, in paying five pound fine.</p>
                  <p>In all his Wars, he had no faithfuller Subjects than the <hi>Low-Countrey</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; witness his own words at <hi>Ingolstat,</hi> where he had like to have been quite oppress'd by the <hi>Pretestant</hi> Army; he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64416:24"/>
still cheer'd up himself and his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by saying, <hi>Courage, my Low-Countrey Subjects will be here shortly:</hi> And when he saw them arrive, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with joy, <hi>We have now vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our enemies.</hi>

The first appearance of sedition, was a Petition presented to the Princess, by five hundred Gentlemen, dress'd like beggars. To content them, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Forces were with-drawn; and not long after Cardinal <hi>Granvell,</hi> whom they much envied, was recall'd. But still in every place there was execution done upon those, whom they call'd he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; who by their constant suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, so animated the people, that at last they would no longer endure they should be put to death, but rescued them out of the hands of the hang-men, by force.</p>
               <p>The King having notice of all, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> should be publish'd in the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> the execution of which caus'd more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and gave occasion to the Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> to take a journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> there he was very well receiv'd by the King, soon dispatch'd; and in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, he brought with him <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> Son to the Princess Regent.

But their fury was stop'd by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people, called <hi>Wallons,</hi> who fell upon them, and routed them.</p>
               <p>The Confederates made a new As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly at <hi>Leege,</hi> and there the Regent sent to them the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> to desire them to forbear all new designs.

undertook his journey, he made nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Gentlemen be publickly executed; and a little after, caused the Earls of <hi>Horne</hi> and <hi>Egmont</hi> to be beheaded; no prayers nor entreaties made in favour of so great a Warriour, being able to prevail with his fierce temper. He va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued as little the threats of vengeance, that were made after their deaths; but in pursuance of his design, went and fought the Army of <hi>Lewis,</hi> which he utterly ruin'd; and immediately turn'd head to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who was got into <hi>Brabant</hi> with another conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Army: him he overcame by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy; for he refus'd to fight, knowing, that the Princes Army for want of pay, would soon disband, which accordingly fell out.</p>
               <p>After this, he demanded the tenth penny, through the whole <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys;</hi> and that was the apple of divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which separated and divided the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> and made two states of them, one part remaining under the <hi>Spanish</hi> domination, and the other making up that powerfull body of the United Provinces, now acknowledg'd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64416:29"/>
by <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth, to be Soveraigns. All the people were very much shaken in their affection to <hi>Spain,</hi> by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer causes; but this last did as it were, precipitate them into war and discord, which have at last by the exactness of their discipline, produced that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable fruit of peace and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>This tenth penny was a new tribute upon all merchandises; besides there was a twentieth upon immoveables, and a hundredth part upon all for once. But the people concern'd in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, chose rather to put hands to their swords, than to their purses; and yet by a strange, but necessary effect of their resolution, they have been forc'd to lay much heavier burdens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves, to enable themselves to maintain the War: but the desire of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty made them endure joyfully that, which they were so much afraid of from anothers hand.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Councell still proceeded to execution upon the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and those that refus'd to pay this new imposition: and though the States
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64416:30"/>
did represent what damage would befall the Countrey, by the removall of Mark-lands, yet he being jealous of his Authority, made them go on. But there happened an accident, which much vexed the Duke, which was, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> stop'd in her harbours, divers Ships loaden with money, destin'd to pay his Army, and caus'd it to be transported into the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This disappointment cool'd the Dukes heat a little, and made him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish a solemn pardon for the following year; but in vain, for by this time he was become so odious, that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple forsook, and turn'd to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as it appear'd not long after.</p>
               <p>About <hi>All-Saints</hi> day, there hapned an unlucky presage of the following ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and which was indeed a great one it self; for the Sea having broken the dikes and sluces, over-flowed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all <hi>Friezeland,</hi> with a great part of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland;</hi> they say, that above 20000. persons perished

in <hi>Friezeland</hi> alone. This great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune made them represent to the Duke, the impossibility of paying the Taxe he requir'd; who little satisfied with their Remonstrances, was upon the point of dealing severely with some Citizens of <hi>Bruxels,</hi> when the news came that the <note n="*" place="margin">The name of a Faction.</note>

The Province of <hi>Overissel</hi> chang'd likewise: but nothing so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Duke, as the taking of <hi>Mons</hi> in <hi>Hainaut</hi> by the <hi>French,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Nassaw.</hi> For fearing lest <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>France</hi> should take this occasion, of invading the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> he immediately turn'd all his Forces that way, which gave time to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to frame their small Commonwealth, and give it some foundation. He besieged <hi>Mons</hi> by his Son at first, and at last came him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and took it, in spight of <hi>Lewis</hi> and his Army; who endeavouring to succour the place, were beaten, and forc'd to a retreat. <hi>Mons</hi> being reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, many other Towns yeelded; and <hi>Malines</hi> for having receiv'd a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison from the Prince, was sacked. The Dukes Son <hi>Frederick,</hi> following his Fathers foot-steps, recover'd <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issel</hi> and <hi>Friezeland;</hi> from thence pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into <hi>Holland,</hi> and by the bloody action he committed at <hi>Naerden,</hi> he fastened an indeleble hatred upon his Nation. <hi>Harlem</hi> also was taken; but <hi>Alcmaer</hi> stood out, and much fortified the Confederates.</p>

The year 1573. was famous, by the Duke of <hi>Alvaes</hi> leaving the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.</hi> He was recall'd by <hi>Philip,</hi> who thought his absence might bring a calm in this troubled Sea; but the agitation was too great to be so soon layed. He was a cruell proud man; a very good Souldier, but inexorable in his chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zings: if he had made a mixture of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and mildness, he had without doubt better fitted the humour of the Nations, he had to do with. He is to this very day in great aversion among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who call all cruell men by his name. It is said of him, that he bragg'd he had brought above 18000. to their end, by the hand of justice: I know not whether it be true; but I know that the States have founded the justice of their pretensions, upon his cruelties. He govern'd six years, and left no body afflicted for his depart. It was said, and well said, that <hi>either King</hi> Philip <hi>should never have sent him, or never have recall'd him.</hi>

The Count <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> had worse fortune; for having brought a brave Army out of <hi>Germany,</hi> he was met at <hi>Nimmiegue</hi> by <hi>Davila,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely defeated; himself and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther slain.

                  <hi>DOn John</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> was receiv'd Governour, upon condition that he should subscribe to the pacification of <hi>Gand,</hi> which he did; but finding himself without Authority, he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized <hi>Namur;</hi> whereupon the States proclaimed him as an enemy, and raised an Army. He was a Bastard of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and had made himself famous, by that immortall Battle of <hi>Lepanto</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Turks,</hi> in which he was Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. The States chose in the mean time the Archduke <hi>Matthias,</hi> Brother to the Emperour <hi>Rodolf,</hi> for their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. Then having assembled their Army at <hi>Gemblours,</hi> they faced <hi>Don Johns</hi> Forces; who couragiously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging them, obtained the victory, but

liv'd not long after it, declaring <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> for his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour. This was that famous <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> who by his valour and conduct, reduced all <hi>Artois, Hainaut, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> to their obedience; who took <hi>Antwerp, Malines, Ipres, Brussels,</hi> and many other Cities; and at last he had brought the Confederates to the necessity of submitting to some forreign Prince for protection, if God had not raised up Prince <hi>Morrice</hi> to defend them. In the mean time the Archduke <hi>Matthias,</hi> finding that the States had a mind to be rid of him, and were ready to call the Duke of <hi>Alencon,</hi> and make him Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> left the <hi>Low-Countreys.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Alencon</hi> went first into <hi>England,</hi> in hopes of being married to Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but the match being deferr'd, he went into <hi>Brabant,</hi> and took possession of the <hi>Dutchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1582. the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> was shot in the face with a Pistoll, which made the people take some jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie of the <hi>French,</hi> and threaten to cut their throats, and their new Dukes.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64416:34"/>
He on his side did complain, that all the Authority was in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his hand; and thereupon fram'd a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign upon <hi>Antwerp,</hi> but fail'd when it came to the execution, so that they were forced to leave the Town: and soon after <hi>Alexander</hi> made them quit the Countrey, in which he did still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, having taken <hi>Tournay, Oude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> and <hi>Breda,</hi> defeated <hi>Biron,</hi> and taken <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>

               <p>All this while, <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> was seriously employed in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and giving Laws to this new Commonwealth; but being wakened by the progress of <hi>Alexander,</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> he made a Remonstrance to the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> that now there was but two wayes left, to provide for their safety; the one was, to submit, and patiently yeeld to the <hi>Spanish</hi> dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the other, to declare the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to be fallen from, and to have lost his right to the said Provinces; and thereupon choose another Prince, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the Duke of <hi>Alenson.</hi> The last of these was followed; and in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Assembly at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi>

was depriv'd of his right and power in those Provinces, and the Duke of <hi>Alenson,</hi> as it has been said before, chosen in his place.

               </argument>
               <p>IT was in the Year 1579. that some of the 17. <hi>Provinces</hi> formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> began to be call'd the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> because of the League and Union which they made to defend
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64416:36"/>
themselves against the <hi>Spaniard</hi> their common Enemy; and though these Provinces be now in the number of seven, yet at first they were not so many, but those that are mentioned in the Annals are these following; <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, Zutphen, Holland, Zeeland,</hi> the Diocess of <hi>Utrect, Friezland,</hi> or that Country which is call'd <hi>Omland,</hi> situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between the Rivers <hi>Ems</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> the Country about <hi>Nimmiegue</hi> and <hi>Arnhem,</hi> the greatest part of the <hi>griet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> of <hi>Friezland, Antwerp, Ypres,</hi> and <hi>Breda.</hi> The Provinces call'd <hi>Overyssel</hi> and <hi>Groningue</hi> followed their example, and were admitted into the Union in the Year 1594. Here follow the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this Union.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all the aforesaid <hi>Provinces</hi> shall be as straightly and intimately uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as if they did all make up one entire <hi>Province</hi> and Politick body; and that they shall never be capable of being dis-united by any will, codicil, gift, ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, sale, contract, agreement, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of any Prince, nor by any other means whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That every one of these <hi>Provinces</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:64416:37"/>

               <p n="3">3. The said <hi>Provinces</hi> shall be bound to defend and protect each other mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and freely, against all Princes and Lords either of their own Country or Foreigners, who shall offer to invade them, or commit any act of hostility whatsoever; and for this effect they shall raise such Forces, and such Money and Contribution as shall be thought fit, and judged necessary by the greatest and major part of the Confederates.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To the end that the said <hi>Provinces</hi> be alwayes in a readiness, and provided against all designs of their Enemies, the Frontier Towns shall be Fortified, and provided with Men and Ammunition at

the Publick charge, by the consent of all the <hi>Provinces;</hi> and that those whose Towns are already Fortified, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless contribute as the rest; and if there be found necessity of building any new Forts, demolishing or change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the old ones, that it be done at a common charge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And to the end that the necessary means whereby to answer all these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs fail not, there shall be leavied and raised every where alike, and by the same form and way, Taxes and Imposts upon all sorts of Wine, Beer, Wheat, Corn, Salt, Cloths, Silks, Cattle, till'd and pasture Grounds, the weight of Merchandizes, weighed in publick weights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That those Regal Rights belonging heretofore to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> shall still remain and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the use aforesaid; that all the Money raised by these, or any other wayes, shall not be destin'd nor imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for any other use than for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the said <hi>Provinces;</hi> and the said Imposts shall be lessened or encreased according to publick emergencies.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Frontier Towns shall be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64416:38"/>
bound to receive or dismiss all Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by the command of the <hi>States,</hi> as likewise to pay them their pay out of the publick Money; and to the end the safety of the said Towns be the better preserv'd, it is agreed that the Officers of the Garrisons shall be sworn, not only to the <hi>States General,</hi> but also to the Magistrates of the particular Towns they shall be in; that care be taken to make a Military Law, to the end the Souldiers be not trouble some to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; that the Souldiers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Garrison be not freed from paying the Imposts, and there be a sum set apart by the <hi>States</hi> to pay the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens for the lodging and quartering of Souldiers.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That a moneth after the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Union, there be a general review made of all those that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the age of 18. years, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 60. and that their Names be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred and declared to the <hi>States General,</hi> to be imployed as they shall think fit.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That there be made neither Peace, War, nor Truce, nor new Imposition without the consent of all the <hi>Provinces,</hi>

not one resisting or standing out; and as for the other things, that concern the administration and execution of the said alliance, that they be undertaken and perform'd by those that shall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the greatest part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; yet that all be call'd if there be either Peace or War, or some other important business to be decided; if the <hi>States</hi> cannot agree, then the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be put to the Arbitration of the Governors of the particular <hi>Provinces,</hi> and that all may follow their decision.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That none of the said particular <hi>Provinces</hi> shall make League or Union with any Neighbouring Power, or strange and remote Prince or People, by their own private Authority, and without the consent of the rest; and likewise that if any Princes desire to come into the aforesaid alliance, that they shall be received by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That all approve of, or reject the same coyn, stamp, and money; and that as soon as can be, there come forth a rule or settlement for coyning, which all shall follow.</p>

11. As for the publick exercise of Religion, whether or no any other ought to be receiv'd besides the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, let every <hi>Province</hi> dispose and ordain about it as they please; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded still that they be all bound to let every man have the liberty of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, without persecution for that subject.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If there should happen any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests between any of the <hi>Provinces,</hi> that then those of them that shall not be concern'd, shall have power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine about the debate of the others; but if in these divisions all were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, then let the Governors of all the <hi>Provinces</hi> meet and decide the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a moneths time, after which there shall be no appeal, exception, revision, or nullity to be pleaded.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That the said <hi>Provinces</hi> and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Union do take a special care, not to give any occasion to Foreign Princes to make War against them; and therefore that they carry themselves towards Strangers with the same equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, justice and moderation, as towards the Naturals; and if any of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64416:39"/>
do infringe and break this Article, it is the duty and power of the others to constrain them to observe it by all means whatsoever.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Governors</hi> of each <hi>Province</hi> shall not lay a heavier Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon those of their Subjects that shall travel to and fro, than upon those that are found Inhabitants.</p>
               <p n="15">15. That the Government and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick administration be well setled, as it is agreed; that there be chosen in the Name of all the Confederates some <hi>Plenipotentiaries,</hi> and that these <hi>Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries</hi> do assign the day and place of the Assembly of the <hi>States</hi> of each <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;</hi> and that they send to them in due time the Grievances, and Heads of matters they are to treat about. Yet if there be such points as require se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, that then they reserve to declare them in the Assembly General of the <hi>States;</hi> that all the <hi>Provinces</hi> being thus advertiz'd, do send their Deputies with their instructions and powers necessary to the place of the Assembly General; that the preference be given by the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Votes, except in important

affairs; that if some Provinces do neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to send their Deputies, that those that shall meet do nevertheless debate and deliberate, and decree, as if all had been there; but if the things to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated will endure a delay, then the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> that have not sent their Deputies shall be call'd upon two or three times, and those that have not convenience of sending their Deputies, let them send their advice by writing.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If the <hi>States</hi> of the particular <hi>Provinces,</hi> have any knowledge of those things that deserve to be examin'd and pass'd in the Council of the <hi>States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> let them give notice to the <hi>Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries,</hi> who shall assign and call together the Assembly of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64416:41"/>
the force of Armes, are as conquer'd Nations used to be with the <hi>Romans.</hi> 'Tis true, that those Towns that by the happy success of the <hi>States</hi> Armes have been with great cost and time conquer'd in <hi>Brabant,</hi> have often solicited their admission and reception into the Body of the Commonwealth; but because they have stood the State in so much blood and treasure, and that they are incapable of assisting and being a help against the Enemy, by reason of their long sufferings, and also because it is fit that they alone who first conspir'd to this alliance, should enjoy it, they have not yet obtain'd their request.</p>
               <p>But to know whether those Towns of <hi>Brabant,</hi> to the number of eight, <hi>viz.

which does Soveraignly and without Appeal judge and decide all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies arising in those parts. This Court sits at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and is made up of seven Counsellors, one Secretary, one Attorney of the Exchequer, and one Attorney General: The Towns like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise conquer'd in <hi>Flanders</hi> have a Court of Judicature at <hi>Middlebourg,</hi> determining all causes Soveraignly.</p>
               <p>The Countrey of <hi>Drent</hi> has many great Priviledges, as the power to choose a Governor; to contribute to the publick necessities as other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces do; and it has also an ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Court of Justice, which goes from Town to Town to hear causes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree upon them without Appeal; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides it has the liberty of naming Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries for the Treasury; but it has not yet the priviledge of sending De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties call'd <hi>Pensionaries</hi> to the <hi>States General,</hi> because they did not at first come into the League and Alliance made between the other Provinces; and also because since that time there has been no occasion of making any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles with any of their Towns, except

               <p>FRom the first time that the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties met to make and ordain Laws, about the setling and firm establishing of the Commonwealth, it was agreed by the 17th.

found requisite to establish a Council of State, <hi>(den Raed van Staten)</hi> which was made up of one President, of the Deputies of the Provinces, of one Treasurer, and three Secretaries. There was in those dayes no set place for the meeting of this Council, because that then the settlement was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, and things were uncertain: but here are the Articles which this Council was bound to observe, and which were to guide them in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration.</p>
               <p>First, That in the exercise of their charge they should not so much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the benefit and advantage of those Provinces which they were Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for, as the good of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>

not receive any disadvantage or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That they shall send every three moneths to the <hi>States</hi> of each particular Province, a Compendium of all their Consultations, and the accounts of their expences and receipts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the <hi>States General</hi> shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult and deliberate with them in affairs of importance, and that they shall call them together, according to the 19th. Article of the Union.</p>
               <p>This last Article was to be understood of such affairs as could not be delayed For their importance.</p>
               <p>By succession of time, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth continuing to prosper and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> being expected in these parts from <hi>England,</hi> to govern as Lieutenant to Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi> there was reason to fear that which had already happened, <hi>viz.</hi> that he or others sitting for him, in the <hi>States,</hi> should endeavour to dive into the secret of deliberations; whereupon it was resolv'd, to settle, besides this <hi>Council of State,</hi> the Soveraign <hi>Council of the States General,</hi> who should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

send them for two years, some for four, six, or more, some for all their life.

               <p>But that which is worth observation, and contrary to the opinion of some strangers, is, that though the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be very unequall in strength and dignity, and that some contribute four times as much in peace and war, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the publick; yet have they all equall right in deliberations, and none has an authority over the other.

               <p>These things deserve to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, because it is ordinarily the first Deputy that presides; and he being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the next takes his place: but the same does not preside alwayes in this great Assembly; for the president is changed every week, and the Deputies of the Provinces take it by turns.</p>

               <p>BEsides the Assembly of the <hi>States Generall,</hi> alwayes residing at the <hi>Hague;</hi> there is besides a great Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, call'd in the language of the Countrey, <hi>De groote Vergaderinge;</hi> which is also convocated to meet at the <hi>Hague,</hi> for affairs of extraordinary importance.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Councell of State,</hi> which is the greatest after the Councell of the <hi>States Generall.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT appears by what has been said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that there is a <hi>Councell of State</hi> of more ancient standing, than the <hi>States Generall.</hi> But since the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of this last, the first takes cognizance of smaller affairs; as of those things that concern Taxes; or the Militia; or those that regard the Towns and Fortresses conquer'd, and the visit of the fortifications of them. This <hi>Councill</hi> is compos'd of the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all the <hi>Provinces;</hi> and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Army, (when there is one) is perpetuall President of it, and has his Vote. There are twelve Counsellors from the <hi>Provinces;</hi> two from <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres;</hi> three from <hi>Holland;</hi> two from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64416:52"/>
                  <hi>Zeeland;</hi> two from <hi>Friezeland;</hi> and <hi>Utrect, Overissell, Groeningue,</hi> and <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> each, one. And because the Generall is often absent, therefore they choose a President, which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily fall to them by turns. Hereof every man makes a Vote, and they reckon by Pole; and then the greatest number carries it. They sit as long, as it pleases the <hi>States</hi> that sent them. <hi>Friezeland</hi> having alwaies had a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour apart, he has had the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of appearing and sitting for them, and of appointing some body to do it in his absence. This Councell being (in effect) as a help to the <hi>States Generall,</hi> they treat much about affairs of the same nature, and often do give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what they do, to the <hi>States Generall;</hi> who upon their information, do Decree: and then the Decree runs thus: <hi>By the Commandment of our Lords, the</hi> States Generall <hi>of the</hi> United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, <hi>upon the relation of the</hi> Councell of State, <hi>of the same Provinces.</hi> And besides the Secretary, the President <hi>(pro tempore)</hi> in the Councell, signs it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:64416:53"/>
This <hi>Councell</hi> does ordinarily meet apart, and of its own accord; but sometimes extraordinarily it joyns with the Assembly of the <hi>States Generall.</hi> When that happens, if the Generall of the Army is there, he takes place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Deputies of the <hi>States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> and he takes the most honourable place, at the upper end of a long Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and as it often happens, when the <hi>Counsellors of State</hi> are dismiss'd, he may keep his place, and assist at the other Deliberations of the <hi>States.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now every time that this <hi>Councell</hi> meets alone, there are two <hi>Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors</hi> supernumerary, who have only deliberative voices, and not definitive Votes, that do assist at it. The one is the <hi>Superintendant of the Treasury;</hi> and the other is the <hi>Treasurer,</hi> or <hi>Receiver Generall</hi> himself. The first keeps ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and controuls all publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, though he keep not the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; the other has in his hands all the publick treasure, of which he gives good account. He is ordinarily heard after the <hi>Intendant,</hi> whose counsell they commonly ask first.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>EAch <hi>Province</hi> has a soveraign power within it self, and may exercise all supreme jurisdiction, except such as ought to be common to all by vertue of their union. For example, that can make Laws obligatory to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; choose Magistrates; punish Criminals; coyn Money; set up Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities; make the Dividends of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Taxes; and impose such as are necessary for the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this is not to be so understood, as if this Soveraignty of the <hi>States,</hi> did exclude the soveraign jurisdiction, which many Towns do exercise within their Precinct: for the end of the <hi>State<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He came into <hi>Holland</hi> in 1585. with so absolute a power, that no Governor before him ever had the like; for he had power to name one half of the <hi>Council of State;</hi> and because he was a credulous easie man, he suffer'd himself to be led by the Nose by some Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers about him, who little intended the advantage of the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> and himself being a particular Enemy to Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henlo,</hi> at last the hatred against him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came great, and all the affections of the people and Souldiers turn'd to <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice:</hi> the treacherous actions of <hi>Stanly</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> English Commanders who had deliver'd <hi>Deventer</hi> and <hi>Zutphen</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> had much exasperated the <hi>States;</hi> and now a general fear began to possess the Lovers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, least they should either be sold or oppress'd: whereupon the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Five Provinces</hi> gave all the charge of

                  <p>Of the charge of Governour.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is a hard matter to reduce the charge of <hi>Governour</hi> under certain Heads, because hitherto the <hi>Provinces</hi> have given them such different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, that they have had a hand in every thing. The <hi>States General</hi> have hitherto communicated all their designs and counsils with the three Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> that have succeeded one another; as also the President of the <hi>States General</hi> has alwayes used to wait upon his Highness before the sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Company; besides, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great Estates they possess in <hi>Zeeland,</hi> and other <hi>Provinces,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy peculiar Priviledges, and have in that consideration and others, many advantages which the <hi>Provinces</hi> may either amplifie or restrain at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>But leaving all this aside, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering barely what belongs to the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64416:59"/>
Office of a <hi>Governour,</hi> we may particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly stay upon these six points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Governour General</hi> may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgive all capital crimes, that deserve death; this Prerogative is call'd <hi>(trech van pardonneren.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In those <hi>Provinces</hi> that have Courts of Judicature, he is alwayes the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of them, and his Name and Titles are in the front of all their Acts and Decrees.</p>

               <p n="4">4. He may send Ambassadors to

Foreign Princes for his own particular concerns, and give private Audience to the Ambassadors of Foreign States, that are sent to the <hi>States General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is his duty to see the <hi>States</hi> Orders executed in those <hi>Provinces</hi> in which he is <hi>Governour.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether or no the <hi>United Provinces</hi> can subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Governour.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SInce we have numbred up the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and declar'd freely what is their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power, it is now fit to consider whether they are so necessary to the <hi>States,</hi> as to make them incapable of subsisting without them. Many Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are of opinion, that these <hi>Provinces</hi> cannot be without a <hi>Governour General;</hi> and the same opinion has taken root in the hearts of many Natives, who are not able to discern those things in the Treaty of <hi>Utrect</hi> which are essential, from those that are mutable, and may be otherwise disposed of, as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of time do vary.</p>
               <p>But since the Soveraign Power has never been entirely resigned into the hand of any one <hi>Governour,</hi> though
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64416:61"/>
some have had very many of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives belonging to it, it is evident, that they in whom the Soveraign Power remains, can perform by themselves those Offices which they are pleas'd to trust a <hi>Governour</hi> with: therefore if a <hi>Governour</hi> does nothing but by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and that because of the absence of those who impower him to act for them; why shall not they, if they be present, take upon them the execution of those things that were before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to anothers care? And though <hi>Governours</hi> be often nam'd and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Treaty of <hi>Utrect,</hi> yet was it not intended for a <hi>Governour General,</hi> for even at that time <hi>Utrect</hi> had its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Governour;</hi> and some years after it was govern'd by the same <hi>Governour</hi> that <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeeland</hi> was.</p>
               <p>'Tis to as little purpose that some pretend, that it is necessary that each <hi>Province</hi> should have its particular <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi> who may in fit season prevent and calm all occasions of Civil commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the <hi>Dictators</hi> did in <hi>Rome;</hi> but in vain, for who sees not but that as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the way of determining those
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64416:61"/>
contests has been by referring them to the <hi>Governour,</hi> and some Deputies of another <hi>Province;</hi> so they may, if they please, leave out the <hi>Governour,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their debates to the Deputies of other <hi>Provinces</hi> alone: particularly considering, that it has been hitherto observ'd, that no <hi>Governour</hi> ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the person of an Umpire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had consulted with the <hi>States Generall;</hi> who being above any inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Province,</hi> have the power of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the progress and encrease of any dissention.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Riches, by which the <hi>United Provinces</hi> do maintain themselves.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY the Treaty of Union made at <hi>Utrect,</hi> it was ordained, that there should be raised an equall summe of Moneys in every <hi>Province:</hi> but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64416:62"/>
hath taught us, that such an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality was very unjust. For, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; is it fit that there should be no more laid upon an acre of Land in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which is very rich, and yeelds twice as much as in any other place, than upon an acre in <hi>Gueldres,</hi> which is poor, and yeelds not half the revenue. The same difference is to be observ'd in all other things.</p>
               <p>It has therefore been judg'd by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon consent, more just and profitable for each <hi>Province</hi> to make a new Order every year; in which each should be taxed according to the then abilities of the said <hi>Province,</hi> and according to the publick exigencies. So for example; if there be necessity of raising 10000. pound, <hi>Holland</hi> alone shall furnish 4000. five hundred of it; <hi>Zeeland</hi> and <hi>Friezeland</hi> a 1000. a piece; <hi>Gueldres Utrect,</hi> and <hi>Groeningue,</hi> 3500. and <hi>Transisulania,</hi> or <hi>Overissell,</hi> the rest.</p>
               <p>This order being once agreed upon, it belongs to the <hi>States</hi> of each <hi>Province,</hi> to consider how it shall be levyed: and this is the true reason why the Taxes and Imposts are so different in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64416:62"/>
of the <hi>States Generall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Levyes thus order'd, are not alwayes receiv'd in money, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the publick Treasury of the <hi>States Generall,</hi> but are distributed by Tallies in the <hi>Province</hi> it self, to those to whom the <hi>States</hi> do owe; which is a very wise caution; for it is certain, that money still lessens as it passes through the hands of many receivers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Among these Levyes, it was thought fit from the very beginning, to give leave to all to transport cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain merchandize into the neighbouring <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> still remaining under the <hi>Spanish</hi> jurisdiction; but there was and is an impost laid upon them; for the receit of which there are Officers, and seachers upon the Frontier. But to the end this licence might be no wayes prejudiciable to the affairs of this rising Commonwealth, they forbid the transport of Arms or Ammunition, under pain of death. Yet at last when victuals and necessaries for life grew dear among their enemies, and that there was an evident advantage for the Confederates to furnish them with those
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64416:63"/>
things, licence was granted, and they drove such a trade with their enemies, as made themselves grow rich and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is likewise a great summe of money rais'd upon the granting of Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, to those in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who desire to transport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the Territories of the <hi>States;</hi> for every Passport costs fifty shillings of <hi>English</hi> money. And yet lest this also should prove prejudiciall to the <hi>State,</hi> they seldome grant any to those amongst their enemies, who are either in military or politick employments: and to any others they scarce grant them for longer than the time of six moneths.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Contributions that are levyed upon those Villages, and that part of the Countrey which lyes between the enemy and them, make another part of their supplyes; for these Bourghs pay as much to the <hi>States,</hi> as to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> and there are Treasurers upon the Frontier for the receit of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Imposts payed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Towns of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:64416:63"/>
make another part of their revenue; for there is excise upon Wine, and Beer, and Salt. A Tax upon Houses, and upon Lands.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They receive a part of the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made by the Souldiers upon the enemy.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They have hitherto had from the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> great summes of money, as long as they have had War with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> to make diversion, did maintain in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the <hi>States,</hi> a body of 6000. Foot, and 2000. Horse at their own charges for many years. The serene <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> in vertue of a Treaty made in 1622. did promise 4000. pound a moneth in time of War.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They have money at use, (that is) they keep a bank of such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys as are lent the <hi>State</hi> by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and pay use for it; five in the hundred is the use the <hi>State</hi> payes.

               </argument>
               <p>THe greatest internall or defensive strength of these Countreys, does lye in their situation, which makes all their Towns easily to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. As for the externall, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in their Leagues and Alliances with Foreign Princes. Let us speak first of the situation.</p>
               <p>That situation which is advantagious for the defence of a Countrey, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising of commerce, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly growing rich, must needs proceed from the neighbourhood of the Sea, and the affluence of great Rivers and Channells; thence comes the Proverb,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64416:64"/>
                  <hi>The</hi> Hollanders <hi>are born for the Sea, and the Sea for them:</hi> of which they are well convinc'd, and consequently spare no cost nor industry to be the masters upon this Element; having long ago graven upon their Coyn this Motto, <hi>Imperator maris est terrae Dominus.</hi> If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had been so wise, as to have spent that treasure in hindring the <hi>Hollanders</hi> trade and navigation, that he layed out upon attaking their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, he had undoubtedly ruin'd them; and he now perceives it, and does en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by all means, though too late, to obstruct their commerce. Besides the Sea, there are the Rivers of <hi>Rhene, Meuse,</hi> and <hi>Jud,</hi> that do make the Countrey almost inaccessible. Besides, if any enemies be taken on this side these Rivers, there is a Law which is exactly observ'd, which commands to hang them up immediately.</p>
               <p>The strong Towns are upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, not only in <hi>Brabant, Flanders, Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres,</hi> and <hi>Friezeland,</hi> but also upon the Confines of <hi>Germany,</hi> as <hi>Rhinbergue, We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> and divers places bordering upon the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Cleves.</hi> The reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

is this: the War being kindled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did first begin to seize, and put themselves in possession of the Towns of the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and of the <hi>Electour</hi> of <hi>Cullen,</hi> that they might the better annoy the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> who fore-seeing the mischief like to arise from thence, sent an Army, and seized as many of these Towns as they could, put Garrisons into them, and nevertheless still preserv'd the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in all their propriety, liberty, and priviledges. Hereupon arose great contests between the <hi>Emperour</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cleves,</hi> and the <hi>Electour</hi> of <hi>Cullen</hi> on one side, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> on the other; but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> kept possession.</p>
               <p>Besides the Garrisons they maintain in all Frontier Towns, they have also two Magazines in each, one with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition for War, the other with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions for life.</p>
               <p>A Governour commands the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: they that command in small Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Towns, are call'd <hi>Commanders;</hi> and they that command in great strong
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64416:65"/>
Towns, are <hi>qualified Governours.</hi> And for the greater safety of the said Towns, the Keys are partly in the <hi>Governours,</hi> partly in the <hi>Bourgmasters</hi> hands. The Civill and Military powers are likewise so distinct, that the <hi>Governour</hi> has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the Inhabitants, nor the Judges of the place any power over the Souldiers.</p>
               <p>As for the Land-Forces, they consist of Strangers and Naturals; but the Strangers do exceed the Naturals in number, who are more enclin'd to long Voyages and Trade, than to Warre. Neither is the <hi>State</hi> endanger'd, by putting the force and military power in Stangers hands; for they being of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nations, as <hi>English, Scotch, French,</hi> &amp;c. have different inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and aversions, and so will hardly conspire to oppress their Masters, who do alwayes mingle them in their strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Towns.</p>
               <p>It is believ'd, that the number of Souldiers paid by the <hi>States,</hi> and sworn to them, does come very near one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand. The Companies are for the most part of a hundred men;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64416:66"/>
some few excepted, who are either stronger or weaker, as necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. The Regiments are of ten, twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen Companies. Each Regiment is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a Collonel.</p>
               <p>The Horse is much inferiour in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the Foot, because that in these Countreys, the greatest employment for Souldiers is besieging and defending of Towns, in which the Horse are not so necessary, as in set Battles.</p>
               <p>There are two sort of Horsemen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd by their Arms, <hi>viz.</hi> Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasseers, that wear iron breast and back-pieces; and Arquebusiers, that carry short Guns on Horseback. Their Horses ought to be sixteen hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full high, measuring from the hoof of the fore-foot, to the top of the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The Infantry has about four shillings and six pence a week pay; and the Horse about fifty shillings a moneth. They that are payed by the <hi>States</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, are soon and exactly payed, but they whose payment is assign'd upon the money that comes from <hi>France,</hi> wait a little longer for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:64416:66"/>
It is very observable in these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> that though there be no Money in the Treasury, yet the Souldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their pay every week or moneth; for every Regiment chooses an Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, who resides near the <hi>States</hi> to sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the payment of those he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents; and when there is no Money in the publick Treasury, he may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and does borrow and take up Money for the present necessity; and it is repaid him again with interest by the <hi>States</hi> order.</p>
               <p>The hopes of the great profit there is to be made, engages these Sollicitors to do thus; for when they advance their Money, it is at the rate of 10 <hi>per Cent.</hi> gains, which they t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e upon the arrears which the <hi>State</hi> owes to the Officers. But this produces another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, which is, that the Officer being forc'd to give so much to the Sollicitor out of his pay, endeavours to recover it again upon the <hi>States,</hi> and musters more men in his Company than he really pays. Besides their pay, the Souldiers have likewise their Lodging free, and the <hi>States</hi> do pay to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64416:67"/>
of all Towns upon that score, six pence a week for each Souldier they lodge, and this is call'd Service-Money.</p>
               <p>If the Enemies besiege a Town, and that the Money laid up in it for the paying of the Souldiery come to fail, they make Money of Tin, Brass, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Pastboard; which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates set a price upon, and such a one as exceeds very much the price of the matter of which such Money is made. In the mean time the Souldiers take it freely; for the siege being raised, or the Town yielded up, there comes a Treasurer who gives them currant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for their other.</p>
               <p>All sorts of Provisions that are brought to the Armies, are free from all Imposts and Tributes, in favour of the Souldiers. In the siege of Towns the Souldiers have likewise gratuity given them, some Provisions for their diet out of the publick Magazines.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers and inferiour Officers being made Prisoners, are at liberty in paying their ransom, which by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the <hi>States</hi> and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:64416:67"/>
is a moneths pay of the Prisoners. The Inhabitants or Citizens are not so mildly dealt withall, for they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to pay whatsoever the Enemy demands, or to rot in Prison, till there be a general exchange made of Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which is once or twice a year. The Women and Children under twelve years old are not to be taken.</p>
               <p>So much for the Forces in ordinary; In extraordinary dangers there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Forces rais'd, which they call <hi>Waertgelders;</hi> to encourage them the more the <hi>States</hi> do promise them Ten pence a day: but because that many, in hopes of so great a pay, do forsake the ordinary Companies, and take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in these new ones, it has been often thought fit to command out, instead of these <hi>Waertgelders,</hi> the Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of every Town, and to mingle with them some old Souldiers, and so make them fit for service.</p>
               <p>Every Souldier as well in the Army as in Garrison, is subject to the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of a Council of War; which is compos'd in the Field, of the <hi>General,</hi> and some high Officers; and in a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64416:68"/>
of the Governour and his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; they judge according to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Formulary prescribed and printed by the <hi>States</hi> order.</p>
               <p>The pay of Souldiers on Ship board is 12 <hi>s.</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> a moneth, besides which they have their diet, which he that commands the Ship is bound to find them, and receives from the <hi>States 6 d.</hi> a day for each man.</p>
               <p>At Sea there is no such custom as the ransom at Land; nay at first all Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were bound hand and feet, and thrown over-board; but because so great a cruelty displeased both <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> they agreed there should be quarter given, but not at such easie rates as at Land. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> reason for this his so great a severity, was that he might deterr the <hi>Hollanders</hi> from venturing to Sea; but it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced only this, that it made them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Ships with more courage and successe than before. <hi>Ostend</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk</hi> were the places from whence they made most incursions upon the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which made them every year put a Fleet to Sea, and come
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64416:68"/>
and besiege the Ports of these two Towns.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Alliances of the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces</hi> with Foreign Princes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe external Forces of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> are their Alliances, which they maintain either by their Ambassadors, or by their Agents. They allow their Ambassadors or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily a thousand pound; only he that is in this quality at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> is allowed more, that he may maintain the glory of his Nation to the eyes of that ambitious people. Let us consider these Alliances one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>With the Emperor of <hi>Germany</hi> there is no Alliance, but only a Friendship, observ'd since these many years in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, though not in reality; for
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64416:69"/>
the <hi>Emperor</hi> has often sent great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under-hand, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have done the same to the Princes of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> Yet the <hi>Emperor</hi> has by divers Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies press'd the <hi>United Provinces</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themselves Members of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as their Princes were formerly; writing to them in the stile of <hi>Faithfull and Well-beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>States</hi> have been so far from consenting to such a Proposition, that they have often order'd that such Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters should be sent back again to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> without being opened; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that theirs was a free absolute State, which had never yielded to pay homage to any Prince. In the mean time, there passes between them all Commerce and offices of Friendship.</p>
               <p>There was likewise a League and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion made between the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> to protect them from the oppression which threatned them from the great Power the <hi>Emperor</hi> was got into; and in this they did nothing but what the care of their Liberty did force them to, for had
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64416:69"/>
those Princes been over-power'd, the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> might have feared the same fate.</p>
               <p>Above two hundred years ago there was an Alliance between the <hi>Anseatic</hi> Towns, and the <hi>Low-Countries;</hi> and there happening to be amongst the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces</hi> some of these Towns, as <hi>Amsterdam, Middlebourg, Dort,</hi> which now make a part of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it was thought fit to renew the Alliance, which was accordingly done in 1614. by a new Treaty, in which the <hi>States</hi> oblige themselves to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Rights and Priviledges of the said <hi>Anseatic</hi> Towns. This the <hi>Emperor</hi> took so ill, that he endeavour'd to make those <hi>Anseatic</hi> Towns that were in the Empire, liable to the crimes of Treason and Rebellion against his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; but by their Ambassadors they proved, that time out of mind they had the right and priviledge of making such Alliances.</p>
               <p>The Treaty of Alliance made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns nothing but a reciprocal liberty for Traffick, and Commerce; and yet these
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64416:70"/>
                  <hi>States</hi> have often been forc'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to their Ambassadors, of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Rates and Customs they did pay in passing the <hi>Sound.</hi> But the necessity they stand in of venting their Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, makes them undergo this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and has produced of late a more strict Alliance for the maintaining of Trade.</p>
               <p>They are likewise in Friendship with the King and Commonwealth of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> particularly for the great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Corn that come from thence; though the Imposts be there likewise very high, and such as have often made the <hi>Hollanders</hi> think of changing their Market, and buying in <hi>Muscovy;</hi> which they would have compass'd by this means: The Countrey people in <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> are such slaves, their <hi>Duke</hi> being the Proprietary of all their Lands, that they never trouble themselves to plough or sow more Land, than just as much as will make such a product, as can find them and their Families food. Thence it happens, that huge Fields of good ground lie wast. Now the <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> design was, to perswade the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64416:70"/>
Duke of <hi>Muscovy</hi> to force his Subjects to Till more ground, and so he would be able to drive a great Trade; and to further this, they offer'd to leave Overseers that should direct the work. While this was a treating, the <hi>Poles</hi> fearing the consequence, bated their Imposts and Customs, and so things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as they were.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1615. there was a Treaty made likewise with the King of <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and Traffick was the ground of it. A little before the said King fell upon <hi>Germany,</hi> the amity was renewed, and it was agreed, that the <hi>United Provinces</hi> should give the said King 400. pound a moneth as long as the War should last between him and the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> but since these few years, the succour that has been given to the <hi>Dan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and the interruption of Trade in that Kings Dominions, have almost chang'd this Friendship into War.</p>
               <p>There has been likewise a very good Treaty for Trade, made with the Duke of <hi>Muscovy,</hi> where, mongst other things, liberty is granted to levy Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers here in his Name, and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64416:71"/>
Ammunition for War into his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
               <p>Trade has also made the <hi>States</hi> make Treaties with the Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Sophy of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the Pirates of <hi>Thunis</hi> and <hi>Algier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>States</hi> have no Alliance, but with the <hi>Venetians;</hi> which is yet maintain'd for the Honour of these two Commonwealths, which are the only flourishing ones in <hi>Europe;</hi> and for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reasons the <hi>Venetians</hi> do give five hundred pound a moneth to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> towards the maintenance of the War with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> as also the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have promis'd the like suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to <hi>Venice,</hi> if it should be attaqued by the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the first birth of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, there was a most advantagious Treaty made with the <hi>English,</hi> under the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who maintain'd this reeling State by the succours of Men, and great sums of Money, which she sent over to them; though in such a way, that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> were bound to respect her as if they had been her Subjects. Now that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64416:71"/>
the Peace is made with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> there remains nothing of this Alliance, but the liberty of Trade and Commerce, and the use of the <hi>English</hi> Ports.</p>
               <p>There has been likewise many Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>United Provinces</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from him great sums of Money towards the carrying on of the War.</p>

               <p>SInce it is true, that a State is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by those means by which it is first acquir'd, the <hi>United Provinces</hi> ought not to neglect their Maritine affairs, because they have and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally get all their subsistance out of the Sea.</p>

to the <hi>States,</hi> and part to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, and are call'd Privateers. The first are set out at the charges of the publick; the other borrow only the <hi>States</hi> Banner and Commission, though to encourage them the <hi>States</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to them a set price, according to the value of the thing they take from the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Men of War of the <hi>States,</hi> serve to convoy Merchant-men to and fro, and preserve them from danger of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Privateers are most imployed to give chase to, and take the rich <hi>India</hi> Ships of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> coming from the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>High Admiral,</hi> who at present is the <hi>Governour General</hi> of the <hi>States,</hi> commands over all Ships of War, but he seldom goes in person, because his presence is necessary at home; his room is supplyed by a <hi>Vice-Admiral.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There are divers of these Assemblies, and particularly in those three <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> which are near the Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> at <hi>Amsterdam, Roterdam,</hi> and <hi>Horne,</hi> this last is sometimes transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Enchusen,</hi> which is a Town of <hi>North-Holland;</hi> in <hi>Zeeland,</hi> at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlebourg;</hi> and in <hi>Friezeland,</hi> formerly at <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Each of these Assemblies consists of seven Counsellors or Senators, who being chosen by the Members of each Province, are delegated and impower'd by the <hi>States General;</hi> they have a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary and a Treasurer.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Governour General</hi> is the head of all these Assemblies, as <hi>High Admiral;</hi> the <hi>Vice-Admiral</hi> represents him in his absence; these Deputies did formerly use to meet at the <hi>Hague</hi> twice a year, and do still meet there, when the affairs require a conjoynt deliberation with the <hi>States,</hi> about the necessary means
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64416:73"/>
of securing the Sea, and furthering Commerce.</p>
               <p>They have a Treasury particular to themselves, and the Money which is in it, is gather'd from the Money that their own Merchants and Strangers pay for Convoys; and likewise from the Imposts laid upon Commodities, that are transported from one Harbour to another. There is likewise brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Treasury all the Money that is rais'd by giving licenses to transport Commodities to the Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Deputies of these Assemblies are bound to give an account every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of all their expences and receipts, to the Commissioners from the <hi>States General.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have also the power of naming Captains to the Men of War, but then the <hi>Admiral</hi> chooses out of those that they have nam'd. In a word, their charge is so to secure the Sea, as there be no interruption neither from Pirates nor Enemies of any other sort, in Trade and Navigation; to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all causes between Seamen and Officers, and that Soveraignly and

without appeal; provided the summe in dispute exceed not fifty pounds; observing exactly all brevity and expedition, not suffering long ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues in any Cause, or giving leave to the parties to reply more than once or twice, and that because or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Sea people have occasion of departing upon long Voyages, and cannot come again suddenly.</p>
               <p>Last of all, it belongs to them to see that the <hi>States</hi> be payed their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of what is taken.

               <p>VVE have seen hitherto what is the Government of the whole Body of the <hi>United Provinces:</hi> now we may descend to the particular Towns.</p>
               <p>The Towns are govern'd by a <hi>Bailif,</hi> a <hi>Senate,</hi> or <hi>Councill,</hi> by <hi>Bourgmasters,</hi> or <hi>Consuls,</hi> and by <hi>Aldermen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is but one <hi>Bailif</hi> in each Town, who to say true has no power of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to pronounce judgement; but in criminal Causes he is as it were an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourney-Generall, and manages accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations against offenders in the name of the <hi>States.</hi> This is done before the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> who have power to examine the heads of the accusation, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce sentence. The <hi>Bailifs</hi> have no Sallary, and all the profit of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rises from the Fines that are lay'd upon the guilty.</p>
               <p>

The <hi>Senate,</hi> and the greatest, is that which is call'd <hi>(Den breeden ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> or <hi>De Vroedschap)</hi> in most Towns, as at <hi>Leyden,</hi> it is compos'd of about fourty persons, according to the number of the richest Citizens, more or less. The ancient Laws admit none to be of this <hi>Senate,</hi> but such as are of the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sort. This Assembly seldome meets, but upon the occasion of choosing new Magistrates; as also when the <hi>States</hi> of the Province are to meet, then the heads of the Deliberations are examin'd in this <hi>Senate</hi> before-hand. They do also controle and correct their <hi>Bourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters,</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> if in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the <hi>States</hi> they chance to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Commission. And to the end they may do it without fear, it has been ordain'd by our wise Ancestours, that the charge of <hi>Senatour</hi> should be perpetuall, that so they may not fear to be persecuted, for what they shall do in the defence of the publick li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bourgmasters</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> are chosen from amongst these <hi>Senatours,</hi> by the plurality of voices.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:64416:75"/>
In some places there are four <hi>Bourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters,</hi> and in some there are but two. Their Office is to determine all that concerns the good order of the Town; as also to inform themselves of all the fallings out of the Citizens, and bring them either by themselves, or others, to an agreement: which if they cannot compass, then their duty is to cite them before the <hi>Aldermen.</hi> They meet in a common Chamber, and give audience to all Inhabitants without distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>In some places there are seven <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> in others nine; They are the Judges of the Town who meet three or four set times a week, and determine all civill Causes between the Inhabitants, and judge all crimes propos'd by the <hi>Bailif.</hi> For the first cognizance of the Cause belongs to the Judge of the place, where he that is cited dwells. Except they be priviledged Causes, the Towns judge of no greater summe than five pounds, and the Bourghs of thirty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; though in very great Cities they may judge as far as thirty pound. The appeal is first to the Court of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:64416:75"/>
and then to the <hi>great Councill,</hi> where there is a double number of Judges; they that are cast are fin'd for having appeal'd without reason. In the Court of the <hi>Province</hi> the Fine is three pound ten shillings; in the <hi>great Councill,</hi> of six pound; and when the Process is re-viewed, if the sentence be confirm'd, the Fine is of twenty pound.</p>
               <p>As for criminall Causes, the Judges are absolute, and there is no appeal from them, neither in the Villages, nor in the Towns; except the <hi>Bailif</hi> require that the criminall should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go a severer punishment, and then the accused has liberty to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>There are two sort of Laws in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the first sort is the <hi>Customes, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and Constitutions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and former Princes, and of the</hi> States. The second is the <hi>Roman Law,</hi> call'd the <hi>Civill Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, that the course of justice be not retarded, nor the Judges time taken up in petty businesses, there are chosen by the <hi>Aldermen,</hi> a certain
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64416:76"/>
number of the richer sort of Citizens, who are call'd <hi>Commissaries of small Causes.</hi> These take cognizance of all Causes that are not above five pound; as also of all Actions for reparation of Honour; and of the Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Masters and Servants, and such like. An <hi>Alderman</hi> presides ordinarily in this Assembly, and is ordinarily a good Civilian.</p>
               <p>There is also in the Senate, or Town-House, and in the Colledge of the <hi>Bourgmasters,</hi> one who is call'd a <hi>Syndi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Tributes and Imposts; of how many sorts they are; and of the manner of levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>SInce as <hi>Tacitus</hi> sayes, there is no War without pay, nor no pay without tributes, and that that is the particular case of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> who have been long in War, to which they have all contributed their share; it is fit to consider of the wayes they use to levy them.</p>
               <p>There are two sorts of <hi>Tributes;</hi> the ordinary, and the extraordinary. The ordinary, which being once granted, are alwayes continued; the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, which are levied but for some certain time, and are then left off.</p>
               <p>There are three sorts of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Tributes;</hi> viz. the <hi>Tribute by Head,</hi> or <hi>Pole-money;</hi> the <hi>Chimney-money,</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:64416:77"/>
and the <hi>Land Taxes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pole-money</hi> is so levied, that the <hi>State</hi> has twenty pence for every Head; they that are extream poor are freed from this Tribute. To my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance this was never practis'd but once, and then too there was great murmuring, and many refus'd to pay.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chimney-money</hi> is that Tribute, which is paid for every Chimney or Hearth, which is twenty pence; and in this the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have imitated the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Naples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Tribute, call'd a <hi>Land Taxe,</hi> may be properly call'd the two hundredth penny, for out of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound a year, for example, is paid one pound to the <hi>States.</hi> So out of four hundred, two pounds, or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shillings.</p>
               <p>To this may be objected, that it is a very hard thing, if not impossible, for the perfect knowledge of the true value of mens Estates to be had. It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, that the Magistrate does take his measure from the publick voice,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64416:77"/>
and the generall report, that any man has to have such and such revenues. And because in this there is room for a mistake, the Law gives any man leave to complain of the greatness of his Taxe; and if he will take his Oath he is not worth so much as the world va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues his Estate at, his Taxe shall be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated.</p>
               <p>As for the ordinary <hi>Tributes,</hi> the chief are these following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Tribute</hi> from <hi>Salt,</hi> call'd in <hi>Dutch (Sonte geldt)</hi> it is levied after this manner: The Magistrate of the Town visits each Family, and reckons every head of it; then they guess at the quantity of Salt that they may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be thought to spend in one year; and thereupon they exact from them a summe of money, proportionable to the quantity of Salt they are to have. And in some Towns they set a price up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the measure of Salt, high or low, as they please.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Excise</hi> upon <hi>Beer,</hi> which all the Citizens pay without distinction, comes to twenty pence a Barrell; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the small Beer, which is not worth
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64416:78"/>
above half a Crown a Barrell, paies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another <hi>Excise</hi> upon <hi>Beer,</hi> paid only by Brewers, which comes to twelve pence a Barrell. Besides, all Seamen, Marriners, and Merchants, pay Excise for all <hi>English</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Beer they bring in.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Victuallers, and those that sell Beer, pay other twenty pence for every Barrell.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Every Hogshead of <hi>Vinegar</hi> paies nine shillings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Impost upon <hi>French Wines</hi> mounts to six pence upon every Stoop. <hi>Rhenish</hi> and <hi>Spanish Wines</hi> pay twelve pence a Stoop. <hi>Brandyes</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> pay ten pence. Of <hi>Beer,</hi> five pence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Butter</hi> payes six shillings a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, which contains three hundred and twenty pound. And for the little Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells, call'd <hi>(Kops tuchen)</hi> there is paid a Farthing a piece.</p>
               <p n="8">8. A <hi>piece of Oyl</hi> paies six shillings; if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fish. Oyl then four shillings and six pence.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Candles</hi> of Wax, and Tallow, pay ten pence a hundred weight.</p>

                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:64416:78"/>
10. The <hi>Impost of round measures,</hi> is that money which is paid for all those commodities that are measur'd in round measures, as Corn, Seeds, Salt, Lime, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Merchants that buy great quantities, do nevertheless pay this Impost.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Turfs for fewell</hi> pay a penny half-penny a Tun; and <hi>Coals</hi> from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> pay thirty shillings for every hundred Tun. The <hi>Coals</hi> burnt in the light Houses pay nothing.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Impost upon <hi>hard merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes,</hi> as five pence for every hundred of Lead; three half-pence for every thousand of Lime-Stones.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For <hi>Wood</hi> to burn is paid the eight part of what it costs.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Silk and gold Stuffs</hi> pay, of twelve pence, one, in every Yard or Ell.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Woollen Cloths</hi> pay thus; every piece of <hi>English</hi> Cloth not being yet dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, payes three pound, if the said piece be worth sixteen Florins of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that is nine pound, or thereabouts. Every piece worth twelve pound payes four pound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hangings and other Houshold-stuff pay one penny in nine
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64416:79"/>
of what they are worth. The way of prising Merchandize is to ask the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant himself, what he values it at; if he undervalue it to save Custom, then the Master of the Custom-house may take it, and pay to the Merchant the price he values it at.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The Impost upon all <hi>Corn</hi> that is ground in the Mills in <hi>Holland,</hi> which every body payes without exception, comes to five pound, one crown, and twelve pence for every quarter of Wheat; to half as much for the quarter of Rye; to five and thirty shillings for Barley and Oates.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The Impost upon all Cattle, Sheep, or Hogs that are kill'd, comes to one penny in seven of the money they are sold for.</p>
               <p n="18">18. There is also three pence a moneth paid for every <hi>Horn'd Beast</hi> above three years old; as also two pence a moneth for every <hi>Horse</hi> above three years old.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The Imposts upon <hi>Herrings</hi> and <hi>Salt-Fish,</hi> brought to the Citizens houses to sell, comes to twenty pence a Pannier.</p>

               <p n="21">21. <hi>Tobacco</hi> payes 10 pence a pound; the Barrel of <hi>Soap</hi> 11 shillings; every Barrel of <hi>Pitch</hi> 16 pence.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Every <hi>Chariot</hi> and little <hi>Bark</hi> payes 20 pence a year; every <hi>Coach</hi> payes 10 shillings a year.</p>
               <p n="23">23. All <hi>Farms</hi> and <hi>Rack Rents</hi> pay the 16th. penny of the value they yield yearly; and those Lands that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary keeps in his own hand, are valued and estimated by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
               <p n="24">24. All <hi>Lands</hi> that are sowed with any sort of Grain whatsoever, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Trees they are planted with, pay 4 pence half-penny an acre, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning from the moneth they were sowed or planted, to the moneth that the recolt is made in.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Every house payes about the 8th. part of the <hi>Rent</hi> it is let for; as if for 48 pound a year, it payes 6 pound to the <hi>States;</hi> but because the Rent of houses is subject to rise or fall, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate sets a constant price upon them,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64416:80"/>
according to their bigness and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency.</p>

               <p n="27">27. The Impost upon all <hi>Immovables</hi> that are sold, under which title great Ships are comprehended, comes to the 40th. penny, that is out of the price of the thing sold the <hi>State</hi> has the 40th. part, which is a very considerable tax, for there is no place in the World where Immovables alter their property so often as in <hi>Holland,</hi> it being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb of <hi>Leyden,</hi> that every three year half of the Town is sold or alienated.</p>
               <p n="28">28.

paper than that which is sealed by the <hi>States,</hi> else they shall be void; and hereupon they thought fit to have two <hi>Seals,</hi> one for businesses of small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and a great one for impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affairs.</p>
               <p>There are many other sorts of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which it would be too long to relate; besides, they have all been publish'd together by the <hi>States</hi> order. Now let us consider the wayes of levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these <hi>Tributes,</hi> which that we may the better do, let us consider those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations and opinions touching this matter, which were had when it was first debated.</p>
               <p>The Proposition of finding a way of raising these Revenues being made, some were of opinion to give Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Magistrates of Towns, or to some persons whom the <hi>State</hi> should pay to gather these Taxes, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable for them; thinking it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther safe nor profitable for the <hi>States</hi> to farm them out. And here are the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons they relyed upon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because publick persons, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Magistrates, have a greater
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64416:81"/>
Authority with them, and so are fitter to keep the people more in awe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because many of these Revenues, as the <hi>Excise</hi> upon <hi>Beer</hi> for example, could not be fixed and certain; for sometimes one Town consumes more one year than another, so that there could be no measures taken with Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They represented, that it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to trust in Subjects hands the publick Revenue; for what if the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers should play the Knaves and break, and hereupon they concluded that Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers were not fit men.</p>
               <p>Some of a quite contrary opinion did maintain, that there were certain Imposts which ought to be Farm'd out for so much a year; adding, that the Impositions were laid upon two sorts of things, upon stable and constant ones, as <hi>Houses</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and whose number and value were easily known; and upon uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ones, as the consumption of <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Beer, &amp;c.</hi> The first sort they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to be rais'd by Magistrates, the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64416:81"/>
other they desir'd to Farm out, and that for divers Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because the people do by all arts and cheats endeavour to avoid the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Excises; that the Farmers for their own concern would be very exact and quick-sighted in the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of such frauds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. These Farmers would have power enough, for they would be backed by the Civil power.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it was of consequence for a State to know precisely its Revenues; which could not be if they were not farm'd and stated. That without this the <hi>State</hi> could not know how to frame designs, nor what to trust to in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them. That thus doing, that is, by Farming, the <hi>State</hi> would come to a better knowledge of its true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue; for by enhancing of it every year, they would at last raise it to the utmost. That it would be expedient to Farm these Incomes to Citizens, only for one year, that so the condition of many Citizens would be better'd, and they enabled to offer more to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:64416:82"/>
4. Lastly, that there was no fear of their breaking, for they would require from the Farmer such security as should secure the publick; besides, that they might be order'd to bring in every moneth a part of the money.</p>
               <p>This opinion was followed, and this way of proceeding is observed to this day; and this is the way they take of Farming them out.</p>
               <p>The <hi>States</hi> by Proclamation publish, that such a day such Revenues are to be Farm'd, and that they will let those have them that shall bid highest. He that obtains it, gives security immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and such as the <hi>State</hi> may lay hold on if he fail.</p>
               <p>There has been two things invented by the Farmers to hinder fraud, and stealing of Custome and Excise; the one is, that all Porters do take every year an Oath, to carry no Merchandize whatsoever into any Citizens house, without giving notice to the Farmer, and taking a Pass from him. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that they that are once disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to have cheated the Farmers, are soundly fin'd, because that faults that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64416:82"/>
may be easily committed, and which are very profitable to the offenders, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not probably be hindred but by rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous penalties.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64416:83"/>
cause of this Enterprize, of sayling to the <hi>Indies:</hi> the one was the strict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Hollanders</hi> all Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce into <hi>Spain,</hi> the only place from which those <hi>Indian</hi> Merchandizes could be fetched. The other was the unreasonable Rates that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Merchants did then sell their Wares at; with the exorbitant Customes that Strangers who traded with them, were forced to pay. Insomuch that <hi>Spain</hi> was become the only Magazine and Bank of riches in <hi>Europe,</hi> having assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled all the treasures of the richest part of the world, whereby they might sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the rest.</p>
               <p>There happened at this very time another accident, which much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the framing of this design. One <hi>Cornelius Houtman</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi> having divers years faithfully serv'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portuguesses,</hi> in their navigation to the <hi>Indies,</hi> was at last ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoner by the <hi>Negroes,</hi> and not like to come out of captivity, except he could pay a ransome far beyond his rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and power: he in this strait implor'd
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64416:83"/>
the help of some Merchants of <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> who redeem'd him, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he should reveal to them all the secret and profit of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> navigation to the <hi>Indies.</hi> By this means it came to be known, that their gain was for every five or six pound, a hundred.</p>
               <p>One only thing did seem then most to oppose the <hi>Hollanders</hi> design, and that was, that it was with some regret, that they did see that the <hi>Venetians</hi> Trade would now fall to the ground. For whereas hitherto they had receiv'd the Merchandizes of the <hi>Indies</hi> by <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> and so over-land to the <hi>Grand Caire,</hi> and did then furnish the rest of <hi>Europe</hi> with them; it was easie to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would be able to perform this Voyage by Sea with less cost. But self-love, together with the desire of being reveng'd of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> prevail'd against this obstacle. But let us consider the first rise of this <hi>Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first <hi>Company or Association of Merchants,</hi> (for at first they were not authorized, as they now are by the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64416:84"/>
                  <hi>States)</hi> chose for <hi>Curators</hi> or <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors,</hi> these following; <hi>Henry Hudd, Reynier Paw, Charles de Oude, Jean Poppey, Henry Duick, Theodore de Os, Silvard Petrisein,</hi> and <hi>Arnould ten Grooten Huyle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These considering that the way by the <hi>Glaciall</hi> Sea, though the shorter by 2000. leagues, and the safer from ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, was nevertheless the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, because they were not sure of a passage; fitted out four Ships, and sent them by the ordinary way, under the conduct of <hi>Cornelius Houtman,</hi> in the year 1595. But being return'd two years and four moneths after, with much less profit than was expected, that did not hinder them from setting out a new Fleet. And as they were busie about it, they had notice that some other Merchants of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> had the same design; whereupon they propos'd to them to joyn their purses, which they did, and made up a Fleet of eight Ships, under the conduct of <hi>James van Neck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time there was fram'd a company at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64416:84"/>
the way to the <hi>Indies</hi> by the Straight of <hi>Magellan,</hi> and the South-Sea; <hi>James Mahu</hi> undertook the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>But before that the Fleet of eight Sail could be come back, the same Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates sent out three more; and a little after return'd back four of the eight that had been sent first, with a very considerable lading, and much to the advantage of the Adventurers. The noise of the great gains to be made this way, made some other Merchants, for the most part <hi>Brabancons,</hi> compose another Company, call'd the <hi>Brabant Company,</hi> and in the year 1599. this Company sent four Ships, to which the first Company added four more.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the mean time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the great progress of these new Enterprizes, and fore-seeing the ruine of their rich Trade by them, resolv'd to use all possible means to crush them while they were yet in their birth. Whereupon they fitted out a Fleet of thirteen strong men of War, who meeting with five <hi>Hollanders,</hi> engaged
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64416:85"/>
them, but were at last constrain'd to fly, and yeeld the <hi>Hollanders</hi> the victory. This check making the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> sensible that strength and open force were not like to prevail, they went another way to work, and employed the <hi>Portuguesses,</hi> whose interest was very strong with most of the <hi>Indian</hi> peoples and Princes: they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all means to make the <hi>Dutch</hi> so odious to those Nations, that they should abstain from all Trade and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with them, representing them as Pirates and Rebels to their King. But the <hi>States Generall</hi> being inform'd of this hard measure given them by the <hi>Portuguesses,</hi> gave order to all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to assault and take all Ships that should any wayes strive to oppose their navigation to the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they struggled pretty well with this great obstacle. But the Merchants themselves being divided into different Companies, and not acting all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously, did spoil one anothers Trade; for either they would all come to one Port of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and so enhance the price of the Natives Commodity, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64416:85"/>
debase their own, or commit some other errour, which made most of their Ships return with much less profit than might have been otherwise expected. The <hi>States</hi> considering these inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, resolv'd to make up one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Company of all the different Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers that would come in, and to grant to them alone the priviledge of trading to the <hi>Indies,</hi> under certain Conditions. This Order of the <hi>States</hi> being publish'd, many out of hopes of gain, others out of love to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, put in different summes, which all together made up six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound, the first stock upon which this Company has built its prodigious Encrease.</p>
               <p>All those that had conributed were call'd Partners, in <hi>Dutch (Participan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten)</hi> because they had part in all the profit and loss of the Company.</p>
               <p>But all those that had contributed more than six hundred pound, were call'd head-Partners, <hi>(hooft-Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panten)</hi> and out of these alone were, and are to this day, chosen the <hi>Curators</hi> or <hi>Directors</hi> of the Company, with a very large power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:64416:86"/>
All these head-Partners together, have the priviledge of naming out of their own number, the Curators, and then in some places the <hi>States</hi> of the Province, in others the Magistrates of Towns are to choose them out of those that are nam'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Curators</hi> are bound to give an account of all incomes and expences, once a year to the head-Partners. They manage all the business of the Company, and are continued in their employment all their life-time, or at least for one and twenty years. They hold their Assemblies in the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient places of each <hi>Province,</hi> and their Assemblies are call'd <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In each of these <hi>Chambers,</hi> there are a set number of <hi>Curators;</hi> at <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> there are twenty; in <hi>Zeeland</hi> twelve; upon the <hi>Meuse</hi> fourteen; and fourteen in <hi>West-Friezeland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides these ordinary Assemblies, there are setled in each <hi>Province</hi> some extraordinary ones, upon occasion, to which the <hi>Chambers</hi> send their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all the <hi>Chambers</hi> of that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:64416:86"/>
are bound to stand to the Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this that is made up of them all. This <hi>Chamber</hi> is setled at <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> for <hi>Holland,</hi> and at <hi>Middlebourg</hi> for <hi>Zeeland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This extraordinary Assembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of seventeen Deputies, call'd <hi>(de Vergaderinge van Seventien.)</hi> Each <hi>Chamber</hi> knows the number of Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that it must send to this Assembly, some more and some less, proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly still to the first money that they put in.</p>
               <p>This is the form of Government that this <hi>Company</hi> lives under within the <hi>States</hi> Territories; and amongst all its Constitutions this is the principall, that the <hi>Curators</hi> shall employ with all care and speed the summes that shall be furnish'd to them, for the setting out of a strong Fleet well arm'd, to drive the <hi>Portuguesses</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of those Forts and strong places which they hold; and in buying those Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures and Wares which we exchange with the <hi>Indians,</hi> giving a yearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their receits and expences; that out of the product something may
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64416:87"/>
still be layed aside, whereby to confirm and advance the Companies Trade and Settlement in those parts; that the rest shall be equally distributed to all the sharers, to every one according to the proportion of the money first put in by them. And this Distribution is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd <hi>Uytde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>linge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This noble establishment thus begun, fail'd not of a very happy success; for now all interests being united as well as strengths, the work was carried on una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously: and by the exchange of some things, (of small value with us) as Looking-Glasses, Feathers, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall, and Glass Rings, Bracelets, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, and other such bables, made at <hi>Nurembergue</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany receiv'd from the silly <hi>Indians,</hi> Silk, Stuffs, Pearls, all sorts of aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Druggs, of great value, and things of that nature. To this adde, the taking of divers strong places and Forts from the <hi>Portuguesses</hi> and <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> who at first little dreamed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invaded so far off, by those whom they thought they did put so much to it at home.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:64416:87"/>
By these means, in six years time, <hi>viz.</hi> from the year 1602. to the year 1608. the Company came to see their capitall summe of six hundred thousand pound, encreas'd to almost three milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>English</hi> money, besides all the gain that had been distributed among the partners. And besides, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests are such, and their Dominions so enlarged in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that they have under their power or protection divers great Kingdomes and Countreys; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many others who have granted to them alone, exclusively to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and <hi>Portuguesses,</hi> the liberty of Trade amongst them.</p>
               <p>Things being brought to this flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing condition, it was thought fit to lay the foundation of a new Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and for this purpose they chose a Town which they call'd <hi>Batavia,</hi> which is so well fortified and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd with a strong Wall of Bricks, that it was able these late years, to hold out before all the Forces of the great Emperour of <hi>Java,</hi> who besieged it with an Army of two hundred thousand men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:64416:88"/>
It was order'd that the <hi>Governour Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> of the <hi>Indies</hi> for the Company, should here reside, and keep a Royal Court; where he enjoyes the same power that the <hi>Governour General</hi> does in <hi>Holland;</hi> he keeps a greater equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and marches with more state than some Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> that he may the more be respected by his own Subjects, and the barbarous Nations round about. At first this dignity was for life, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it seem'd dangerous to let so much power reside in one man so long, it was resolv'd to follow the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, and limit the time of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to three years.</p>
               <p>In this Town are likewise establish'd two <hi>Soveraign Courts,</hi> in one whereof fits the <hi>Governour</hi> with his Associates, to treat of the publick affairs of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as Peace, War, Alliances, Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the other is a <hi>Court of Justice,</hi> where causes are tryed between parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men.</p>
               <p>Besides this, there are in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Islands depending upon the Company, two <hi>Soveraign Magistrates;</hi> one of which commands the Militia,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64416:88"/>
which is quarter'd in different places, to be in a readiness to keep the Natives down; and the other has the care of all that concerns Trade; and to the end that they may not behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves dishonestly, there are adjoyn'd to them certain Officers call'd <hi>Censours,</hi> who keep a Register of all Occurrences, and give account of them every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Governour</hi> and his Council. Out of these Registers the Council picks the condition and posture of the Companies affairs, and having drawn it up, sends it into <hi>Holland;</hi> and the <hi>Curatours</hi> thereby know how to govern themselves in their supplyes.</p>
               <p>At the same time there was some project made for the better multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Colony, that so at last they might equal the <hi>Indians</hi> in number, and not need to drain <hi>Europe</hi> every year for men. To further this, they built a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick house, in which were maintain'd at the publick charge great numbers of young Maids, brought from <hi>Holland;</hi> and the Souldiers and Seamen had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to make their addresses and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them. But this did not succeed, for
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64416:89"/>
it was found by experience that the children born of <hi>Dutch</hi> Parents in the <hi>Indies,</hi> were not so lusty nor so long liv'd as those that were born of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Father and an <hi>Indian</hi> Mother.</p>
               <p>The Trade to the <hi>Indies</hi> is driven with ready money, or with Exchange; the <hi>Japponeses</hi> take ready money; all the <hi>Indians</hi> exchange their Commodities for ours, which at first were of so small a value, and theirs so rich, that for every five pounds worth of ours, we had a hundred pounds worth of theirs. Some of these Nations have given to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> alone, the priviledge of Trading with them; for example, they alone can buy Pepper, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence set what price they please upon that Commodity.</p>
               <p>Every year in certain seasons the Fleets set sail for <hi>Holland,</hi> and every year new Fleets go from <hi>Holland</hi> for the <hi>Indies.</hi> The Merchandizes brought from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> are publickly exposed to sale, and the money produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, distributed among the Sharers; so for a hundred pound which a particular man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shall have put into the common
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64416:89"/>
stock, he shall have rarely twenty, sometimes thirty, and most commonly fourty pound profit; so that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual rent comes almost to half the Capital.</p>
               <p>This distribution is made either in Money, or Merchandize; the truth is, that heretofore they did seldom use to deliver out any Merchandize, but of late some Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> having gone about to set up the same Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to discourage and break them at their first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, did think fit to make a distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Merchandize. Whereupon there coming abroad at once so much, the price of all could not choose but fall, and so make these Strangers not able to afford them at such easie rates. 'Tis true, that this did the Company them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves much prejudice, but still it was a less loss to them, for the greatest mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that can befall them, is that other Nations find the way to the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is besides, this considerable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that all the Sharers do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make a vast interest of their money, but their Capital encreases every day,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64416:90"/>
as the Companies stock encreases. So if he that has put in at first 400 pound, will sell (which they seldom do) his right to another, he will without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty get 1800 pound for it; and it is to be hoped, that at last the very annual distributions will be worth the Capital every year.</p>
               <p>Some years ago the <hi>Company</hi> of the <hi>West-Indies</hi> was establish'd after the same model; and a purpose to cross its settlement, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Truce of twelve years from the <hi>States;</hi> one of the Articles of which was, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take no Navigation to the <hi>West-Indies:</hi> he obtain'd it, and all that while the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was crush'd; but shortly after the Truce expir'd, it was again set a foot with more eagerness.</p>
               <p>The Capital of this <hi>Company</hi> was seven hundred thousand pound, and the <hi>Curatours</hi> having set out a brave Fleet, the Town of <hi>St. Sauveur,</hi> otherwise call'd <hi>baia de todos los Santos,</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and taken from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but shortly after it was unfortunately lost again. In the mean time, the booty
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64416:90"/>
made by taking and plundering the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> and <hi>Portugu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ses</hi> Ships was so rich, that the Sharers of the Company re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd five and twenty <hi>per Cent.</hi> at the first distribution. A little after the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> Silver Fleet, valued at twelve hundred thousand pound, having been taken, the Sharers had half their Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal refunded to them; but experience soon made appear, that in this the <hi>Cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi> were rather prodigal than liberal, because that the <hi>Company</hi> having then no setled establishment in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> it had been better to have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed that money towards a further confirmation of their affairs, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly having undertaken so smart a War against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this reason, their Capital being exhausted by following misfortunes, the <hi>Curatours</hi> were fain to exact a new Contribution from the Sharers, <hi>viz.</hi> the moiety of what they had given at first, which made up twelve hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pound, to which were added four hundred thousand pound more, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution was taken to pay interest of six
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64416:91"/>
                  <hi>per Cent.</hi> for all the money advanc'd to the Company. Their Treasury thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited, gave them courage to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a new Expedition, upon the great Town of <hi>Fernambove;</hi> after this they invaded some borders of <hi>Africa,</hi> from whence having driven the <hi>Portugueses,</hi> they got into possession of the Trade with the <hi>Africans,</hi> who sell their young Negroes. This is the sinew of the <hi>West-India</hi> Trade, for they being of a strong robust constitution, are able to endure those hardships in the Sugar Mills and Mines, that no <hi>Indians</hi> or <hi>Europeans</hi> are able to undergo.</p>
               <p>Though things have since succeeded pretty luckily, yet have not the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours</hi> made any dividends amongst the Sharers; not but that they have brought from thence twice or thrice every year vast quantities of rich La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which they have well sold; but because they have alwayes been forced to maintain War, till the <hi>Portugueses</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Orders and Constitution of this Company, are conformable to those of the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> except that there are
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64416:91"/>
alwayes some Deputies from the <hi>States General,</hi> that do preside in their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Assemblies; and this because the <hi>States</hi> have contributed a great sum of money towards their first establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Soveraign command both by Land and Sea, is in the hands of a <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General,</hi> that resides in <hi>Brazeel;</hi> it is now Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Nassaw.</hi> There are added to him as his Councel, two or three of the <hi>Curatours</hi> of the Company; there is also a <hi>Soveraign Court of Justice</hi> to hear and determine causes between particular men.</p>
               <p>This Company has other designs, and does not resolve to keep within the streight limits of <hi>Brazeel,</hi> but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to open a passage to those rich M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

with, it being so much their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.

               <p>These two <hi>Companies</hi> have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Trading alone into both the <hi>Indies,</hi> not for ever, but for twenty or thirty year, more or less. And it was wisely order'd so for two reasons: First, because it may be the necessity of affairs might have been such, as to have oblig'd the <hi>States</hi> to make Peace or Truce with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> which it may be would not have been obtain'd, without relinquishing the Trade to the <hi>Indies,</hi> which they could not do had they granted a perpetual priviledge to these <hi>Companies.</hi> Secondly, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they demand the renewing of their Priviledges, the Commonwealth may take occasion to demand a round sum of money in acknowledgement of the favour they receive.</p>
               <p>In a word, these two <hi>Companies</hi> are
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64416:92"/>
so well establish'd, as to be upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions a very great prop to the <hi>State;</hi> for they are a Nursery of Souldiers and Seamen, out of which in time of War the <hi>States</hi> may upon a sudden be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Ships, Armes, and some thousands of Men, and by which in time of Peace, many thousands got a very handsom livelihood.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>What Judgement may be made of the lasting or decay of this Commonwealth.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>CArdinal <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> who was for some time the Popes Nuncio in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> has writ the History of their Wars, and in his Book has given me occasion of adding here this Chapter. For he has propounded the same Question, and after he has brought some Reasons, which seem to conclude in favour of the perpetuity of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64416:93"/>
he does produce some others to shew that a contrary opinion is more likely.</p>
               <p>'Tis certainly a great vanity to go about to dispute about futures; yet the Form and Government, and present felicity of a State, may give us leave to give a guess at its future happiness.</p>
               <p>And first, if we consider the cause of the founding of this <hi>State,</hi> we cannot think that it will ever be dissolv'd: For that was the recovering of lost Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the preservation of them when recovered; two things mightily priz'd by all mankind, but particularly by the Northern Nations of the world. Besides, not only by this the Liberties of all its Subjects are secur'd, but none of the neighbouring Nations can stand in fear of losing theirs, by the increase of this; so that it will be no bodies In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to procure a change; for the people cannot be more easie than they are already: adde to this the mutual aversion between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that it is natural to fear, and not to trust those that we have offended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:64416:93"/>
Besides, let any body cast back their eyes upon the first change, and they shall find it such as no body is offended at. 'Tis most certain, that when in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment men pass from one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the other, there are many whom a desire of the first Government does sollicite and possess; but here it was not so, for except the change that was made of the person of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the <hi>States General,</hi> there was no change made in the Laws, Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and Customs of these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</hi> Since therefore that the antient Laws, and Magistrates, and all other Priviledges do remain, it is easily agreed, that the change was scarce sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the Inhabitants. And upon this we may found this maxim, that <hi>Those States that have suffer'd least in their change, are like to last longest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inequality of strength and riches in these <hi>Provinces,</hi> is one of the tyes of their perpetuity, though ordinarily it be the cause of ruptures and fallings out in these cases.</p>
               <p>If we consider the riches of these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> and the industry of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64416:94"/>
to acquire them, we may certainly conclude that they will not be wanting to themselves in their Government; besides, without doubt as long as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> power shall give occasion of jealousie to <hi>Europe, England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> will never forsake the protection of <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we consider also the example of some Commonwealths of our time, as of the <hi>Swizzers,</hi> who do not only main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themselves free from neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Princes, by the natural situation of their Countrey, but are a terrour to many of them. These are our reasons, but Cardinal <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> brings some against them as follows.</p>
               <p>Liberty begets license, that begets inequality, inequality begets Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; so the <hi>Romans</hi> having driven out Kings, gave themselves up to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their Liberty; after that, they fell out by the inequality of Charges and Honours, and at last fell under the domination of Emperors.</p>
               <p>To this is answer'd, that it is in vain that this example is alleadged, because the change proceeded from the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64416:94"/>
in the constitution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, in which it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided against inequality; but it is not so with the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for what he sayes, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Governour General</hi> is too great, we do confess it; yet the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>States</hi> is above it, for in him lies only perswasion, in them the power of commanding.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that the charges of a War are here incredible and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and that the Treasury must needs be exhausted. I shall answer, that our Enemies are not in a better condition, but there is this difference between us, that our Enemies grow Beggars, and we grow rich under this oppression.</p>
               <p>If it be further urged, that one <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, Holland,</hi> is much superiour to the others in strength and riches, and so may usurpe the domination over the rest. I shall answer, that in this inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of power, all the <hi>Provinces</hi> are equal in Authority, and do not meddle with one anothers affairs.</p>
               <p>As for the diversity and plurality of Religions, it is so far from being an
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64416:95"/>
apple of discord, that it is a tye of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and concord, every one being pleas'd with the liberty he has to enjoy the freedome of his conscience.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>GErmany</hi> which is one of the noblest parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> is divided into two parts, high and low. It is not our design to say any thing of the <hi>higher Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The lower, call'd the Eye of the North, by reason of its excellency, is compos'd of seventeen Provinces. Those of them that lye upon the banks of the River <hi>Rhin</hi> towards the North, were us'd to be reckoned among the Lordships of the <hi>upper Germany;</hi> and the others upon the banks of the same River, towards the East, were ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64416:95"/>
esteem'd dependances of <hi>Gallia Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gica.</hi> Each of them have been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd till within these few years, by their particular Princes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses.</p>
               <p>The Provinces of <hi>Brabant, Limbourg, Luxembourg,</hi> and <hi>Gueldres,</hi> were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Dukes. <hi>Flanders, Artois, Hainaut, Zeeland, Holland, Namur,</hi> and <hi>Zutphen,</hi> by Earls. <hi>Antwerp</hi> which bears the title of the Marquessship of the holy Empire, by a Marquess. <hi>Friezeland, Utrect, Overyssell, Malines,</hi> and <hi>Groeningue,</hi> by Bishops and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Lords.</p>
               <p>The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth was the first Soveraign of all these rich Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; to the possession of which he attain'd, by being Heir to the Branch of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Houses of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Austria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> his Son was his Successor in his time. The exorbitant punishments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on those that professed <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, with the intolerable severity of the Inquisition; the breach of the peoples priviledges, made them revolt, and endeavour to maintain by force,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64416:96"/>
that which tyranny would extort from them. Their Enterprize has been bless'd with success; for seven of these Provinces have cast off the yoke of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due unto him, and have made an Union and League together for their defence, whence they are call'd the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and are <hi>Gueldres, Zutphen, Holland, Zeeland, Frieze, Utrect, Overyssell,</hi> and <hi>Groeningue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the <hi>Provinces,</hi> for whose service that incomparable Hero, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> Son to <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> has waged and managed a War against the most powerfull Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> with a success worthy his prudence and courage. He was so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd a Prince, that it is better to be silent, than to go about to praise one, whose merits can never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall'd with words; but they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the hearts of all the Nations he so highly obliged by his singular valor and conduct.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Provinces</hi> above-mentioned ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occasion to treat of their publick concerns, send their Deputies to the <hi>Hague,</hi> some one, some two or more,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64416:96"/>
according as their rank and priviledge is. They are ordinarily chosen among the most sufficient, able, and pious men, and such as deserve to be admir'd for their experience. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd the <hi>States Generall,</hi> and have the power of treating and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the most important affairs of the Commonwealth, as Peace, War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word; their duty is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all the ends of Government, that they may preserve the Commonwealth flourishing, and safe. But I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to give a particular account of the Government of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and I think fit to give the Reader notice, that whatsoever is said of them, may be applyed to the other <hi>Provinces,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are done in <hi>Holland</hi> with a greater <hi>apparatus,</hi> and more solidity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thyerry</hi> of <hi>Aquitain</hi> was the first Earl of <hi>Holland;</hi> thirty Earls or Countesses have succeeded him in this dignity, all upon condition to preserve the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and immunities of the people; which having been exactly observ'd by them all, were first violated by <hi>Philip</hi> the second, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64416:97"/>
he was deposed, and from that time forward the Soveraign Power devolv'd to the <hi>States.</hi> The <hi>States</hi> are <hi>a publick Assembly of the Nobles and the Deputies of Towns.</hi> The <hi>Brederodes</hi> have the first rank among the Nobles; the <hi>Wassenars</hi> were more ancient; the <hi>Egmonts</hi> the powerfullest; the <hi>Scages</hi> follow the <hi>Brederodes;</hi> then the <hi>Assendelf;</hi> the <hi>Douses;</hi> the <hi>Warmonts;</hi> the <hi>Podgeests;</hi> the <hi>Matenesses,</hi> and others. The Reader must forgive me if I am mistaken in this account.</p>
               <p>Three Nobles and no less are us'd to sit in the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland.</hi> The Towns that send Deputies, never send fewer than two. There are six princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Towns who have this right; <hi>Dort, Harlem, Delf, Leyden, Amsterdam, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gou.</hi> There are also some others, as in <hi>South-Holland, Rotterdam, Gorchum, Schiedam, Schoonhoove,</hi> the <hi>Brill;</hi> in <hi>North-Holland, Alcmaer, Horn, Enchuse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is likewise practis'd to call the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to ordinary Assemblies; but when there is an extraordinary Deputation for making of Peace or War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then the other smaller Towns may likewise send their Deputies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:64416:97"/>
The <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> meet ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every quarter once, and sometimes between while, and that at the <hi>Hague,</hi> as the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Gueldres</hi> at <hi>Nimmegue,</hi> or <hi>Zutphen.</hi> The <hi>Provinciall Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> presides in these Assemblies, and takes care that they be held with order, and things manag'd with prudence. He resides ordinarily at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and does no other Office but this; he is to shew himself impartiall and just even to the least Borrough or Corporation; he must take care that nothing pass that is contrary to the Customes and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the <hi>Province.</hi> The first day of the Assembly he is to perform the Office of Speaker, and to break the matters to the Deputies, to ask their advices, and take their Votes, and declare for those that are the major part. He is also to keep a Register of all that is done, and to send a Copy of it to all the Nobles and Towns, within eight dayes after the rising of the Assembly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>States</hi> being solemnly assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and having all taken an Oath of fidelity and secrecy, do deliberate about the Propositions made by the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:64416:98"/>
which are ordinarily reduced to heads. Their ordinary matters are Subsidies, Contributions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in State and Government, Peace, War, Leagues; of alienating, giving, and otherwise disposing of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Province;</hi> of granting Priviledges, Patents, and many other things, which for brevity I omit.</p>
               <p>As for the order observ'd in giving their Votes; the Nobles begin, then the Towns follow in the order they are set down above; every one says his opinion and reasons with leasure, and quietly, no body interrupting him, and that which the major part carries, is the Law.</p>
               <p>The <hi>States</hi> as it has been said, meet but once every three moneths; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore because there may be extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry business, they choose certain Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who sit alwayes to deliberate of such matters as happen between the Meeting times, and which cannot be deferr'd. By the care of these all Land and Sea-affairs are govern'd, and all ministred. The Deputies are call'd <hi>Collegues,</hi> and they that take care of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64416:98"/>
the Sea-affairs, <hi>Counsellors of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are six in the Colledge of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, and are most commonly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen for one year, out of the Nobles and Citizens of Towns, and are bound by Oath to observe carefully, and without interest, all that shall be commanded them, to take neither bribe, present, nor pension from any person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. They are to confer Notes with the Governour of the <hi>Province,</hi> and to give him good and faithfull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</p>
               <p>They are also to take great care, that the Resolves and Orders of the last As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies be put in execution; to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate of all such things as are not left to the Governours care; to call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>States</hi> upon such occasions as will admit of no delay.</p>
               <p>They are also to provide, that the Towns and Villages of the <hi>Province</hi> do live in peace and union one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that there be no violation of the <hi>States</hi> Orders, either by force or fraud; to sollicit punishment against riotous Souldiers and Officers that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64416:99"/>
Exactions and Extortions.</p>
               <p>They are also to keep a Register of the Arms that are in the Magazines; that the ordinary proportion of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition be deliver'd to the Garrisons; that from time to time there be made Fortresses and Forts in <hi>Holland,</hi> and those kept in repair. It is not to be forgotten, that it is to them at last that comes all Exchequer Suits about the publick revenue and receit of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the absence of the <hi>Governour Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> they determine all Causes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prisoners of War, touching Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Booty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here follows the method they use in all their affairs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They do the business that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the whole <hi>Province.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Those affairs that regard Towns and Corporations.</p>
               <p>Last of all, They decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies between private persons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Counsellors of the Admiralty</hi> who are six in number, ought to be very carefull, and to act conjoyntly with the <hi>Admirall,</hi> the <hi>States,</hi> and their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties,</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:64416:99"/>
to have alwayes a convenient Fleet ready, to secure the Sea from Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and that all Merchants and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers passing to and fro upon Rivers and Channels, be duely provided of Pasports. They are also to find out the ablest Pilots and stoutest Captains, and when they have sworn them, give them their Orders. They are sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Judges of all abuses and frauds committed in falsifying and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting Pasports; as also of all quarrels and suits between Sea-men and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers aboard the Ships. In a word; they have all the power that Admirals do enjoy in <hi>England, France,</hi> or any other Countrey.</p>
               <p>I have not time to shew here by what Agents and Officers the <hi>States</hi> do administer justice to their Subjects; keep accounts of their treasure; give Livings and Fees to be held from them; and many other things, which would require a greater Volume.</p>
               <p>It remains to satisfie some Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans curiosity, who would know it may be, whether our <hi>State</hi> be Monarchie, Aristocracie, or Democracie; or of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64416:100"/>
which of these it participates most. To which I answer, that I think the Government of <hi>Holland</hi> to be a fit mixture of them all.</p>
               <p>In the person of the <hi>Governour Generall,</hi> who commands the Armies both at Land and Sea with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Authority, is seen Monarchie; the <hi>States</hi> represent Aristocracie; and Democracie is seen in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Cities and Towns, for nothing is done without the consent of the meanest Inhabitant.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:64416:101"/>
It is most certain for that in past ages, for the time of 800. years, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Administration of the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Holland, West-Frieze,</hi> or <hi>Zeeland,</hi> was committed to the care of <hi>Earls</hi> or <hi>Countesses,</hi> who had receiv'd this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the <hi>States,</hi> and that upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conditions.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Earls</hi> did govern with so much moderation and prudence, that they did never undertake either to declare War, or make Peace, or lay Imposts or Taxes, without asking the advice and consent of the Nobles, and of the Magistrates of Towns, though they had their own Privy Councellors, men of great capacity and abilities; but they did much yeeld to the Authority of the <hi>States,</hi> for any business that concern'd these Nations.</p>
               <p>This Government thus founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equity and justice, could not choose but attract the blessings of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its Lords; and indeed it did, for no Princes ever perform'd more glorious actions, or receiv'd more demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of honour from their Neighbours, than they. <hi>William</hi> the second, Earl
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64416:101"/>
of <hi>Holland,</hi> was chosen Emperor in the year 1247. And that which is yet an addition of glory for these Princes, is, that they have maintain'd many bloody Wars, obtain'd many famous victories, and alwayes so defended the very bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their States, that their enemies have not been able to get any ground upon them.</p>
               <p>We may also protest with truth, that in the space of 800. years, <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeeland</hi> were never conquer'd nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by any Strangers whatsoever; neither did they pass under the power of any Foreign Prince, which is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that we believe no <hi>State</hi> in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> except it be the Republick of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> can brag of.</p>
               <p>We do ingeniously confess, that the firm Constitution of this our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, does consist in the union and good intelligence which is between the <hi>States</hi> and the Prince; for the power of these <hi>Earls</hi> was very inconsiderable without the help of the <hi>States,</hi> they having nothing but their own Demean or Revenue to live upon, and uphold the splendor of their Court. We have
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64416:102"/>
also observ'd, by what means and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they have often made their Courts remember that duty, which some evil counsellors had perswaded them to forget, and that not only by Remonstrances and Petitions, but often by chastizing and personally punishing those, who wickedly abusing the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Authority, did lead them so much out of the way of justice and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>We find likewise in our Histories, that the <hi>States</hi> have chosen Guardians for their Princes under age; and that <hi>William</hi> the Fifth being run mad, they created a Lieutenant-Governour in his room. In a word; 'tis a thing questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by no body, that the Soveraign power was alwayes in the <hi>States,</hi> whensoever their Princes came to die, or were otherwise disabled from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Functions of their Charge; and in those Cases they did appoint a Governour, whom they called <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> or <hi>(Ruwarde.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under the Domination of the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> this Right was also main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; for a little after the death of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64416:102"/>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> their Duke, and his Daughter the Dutchess <hi>Mary, Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> having undertaken to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some novelties, and oppress the Authority of the <hi>States,</hi> was so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that had he continued he had without doubt undone himself.</p>
               <p>The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> being yet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor receiv'd Guardians, and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> receiv'd Governors from the said <hi>States;</hi> and though their liberties had suffer'd some diminution under the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> yet did the said Emperor alwayes respect and honour them, as being perswaded that without their assistance his power could not stand. Upon this Subject he gave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grave admonitions to his Son, wishing him to govern with all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and not by any means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate that power, whose consent he must have to enjoy his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>And indeed he now knows to his own and these <hi>Provinces</hi> great cost, the truth of what his Father did foretell; for there can be no other cause alledged of the troubles and revolutions of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64416:103"/>
                  <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> than his going about to infringe their Priviledges, and fasten the yoke of servitude about their necks. Though these things be as clear as day, yet we have thought it necessary to publish them to the world; because that many being yet in suspence and ill-inform'd, do think that the <hi>States</hi> are only a tumultuous Assembly of some Deputies, who being men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the quarrell, do carry on things more according to their own ends, than to the publick good. But they that will open their eyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the noble actions perform'd in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeeland</hi> within these fifteen years, will easily see that they cannot be the effect of some few persons passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they must necessarily be secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the unanimous consent of whole Nations.</p>
               <p>Therefore that none may any longer have the least pretext for their doubts, we will give such evidences of our power, as shall shew whence it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Princes that heretofore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, were not only possess'd at first
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64416:103"/>
of this honour, by the consent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the <hi>States,</hi> but have also been continued in this their dignity, by the same, means that all those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of which they were made heads, did remain in the same entire state of liberty; a thing which it may be we should not now be able to brag of, had not the <hi>States</hi> alwayes had a vigilant eye upon the actions of ambitious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the malice of ill Counsellors, and applied present remedies upon all occasions, and so stop'd up the way to tyranny, as to make it not worth their while to endeavour it.</p>
               <p>These <hi>States</hi> are divided into two bodies; the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and the <hi>Towns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Nobility,</hi> by reason of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient extraction, their rich possessions, and their gallant actions, do justly compose the first body, and meet with the Deputies of Towns in publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, to provide for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Towns</hi> have almost all the same Government.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Colledge of Senators</hi> of the Towns is chosen from among the Patricians,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64416:104"/>
who in some places are forty, in others thirty four, twenty, more or less. Being once rais'd to this honour, they enjoy it as long as they live, or as long as they have <hi>Jus Civita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is:</hi> when they die or remove to other places, others are chosen in their place by the common consent of the Citizens.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Colledges</hi> alone have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of deliberating and determining the affairs of the Towns, and that which is resolv'd upon in these Assemblies, is by the people receiv'd and obeyed.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Colledge</hi> are every year chosen the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> viz. four <hi>Bourgema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> three, two, or seven <hi>Aldermen,</hi> (for so 'tis they call the Judges) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister justice for one year. In some <hi>Provinces</hi> these <hi>Magistrates</hi> are chosen absolutely; and in others there is a double number chosen, and out of them the Governor chooses those that are to be Judges.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bourgemasters</hi> duty is to take care to make good orders be kept through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City in all things, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that the publick be no wayes dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged. The <hi>Aldermen</hi> determine
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64416:104"/>
Causes, and punish Crimes. The <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> have the super-intendance over all these in <hi>Holland, Zeeland,</hi> and <hi>West-Frieze;</hi> insomuch that the Princes of these <hi>Provinces</hi> had not reserv'd to themselves any other power, than to create one to preside in these Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. This is the true state of these Countreys; whence may be inferr'd, that the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> the <hi>Senates,</hi> and the <hi>Nobility</hi> joyn'd together, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the whole body of these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that their government is so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually temper'd, as to subsist as long as it has done, and with as much if not more felicity.</p>
               <p>When publick affairs require that these <hi>Colledges</hi> of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and Towns should meet, they are adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd of it by their Deputies, who do call them together by express Writs sent to them, in which the heads of the matters to be deliberated upon, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted. These having been discuss'd and weigh'd in the Assembly, Deputies are sent to the <hi>States Generall,</hi> with power to consult and determine such things, as shall be found necessary for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64416:105"/>
the good of all the <hi>Provinces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Nobility</hi> is present in a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number. The <hi>Towns</hi> send one <hi>Bourgemaster,</hi> with some <hi>Senators.</hi> Their duty in generall is to treat and decide, concerning all that has any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the welfare of the <hi>State;</hi> and particularly they are bound to provide for the maintaining of the Immunities and Priviledges.</p>
               <p>These assembled are call'd the <hi>States;</hi> not that they are, but because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present a nobler and more powerfull Assembly which sent them thither. Neither is it to be imagin'd, that one can easily by favour and faction attaine to this degree of honour; for besides that naturally the common people are averse: for those that seem to desire the choice of such a one, is void of its self. Besides, who would be so mad in the age we live in, as to purchase ambitiously an employment, which carries with it nothing but cares and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; and which, by the malice of those who study to defame and black the most unspotted reputation, is a place of danger, rather than a degree
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64416:105"/>
of elevation? Certainly they that are well acquainted with our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, will witness how many artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nay what threats and constraints we are fain to use, to get the Deputies to accept of their charges.</p>
               <p>When these Assemblies are dissolv'd, the <hi>Deputies</hi> are bound to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Resolutions to those that sent them.</p>
               <p>This is that foundation upon the which our Commonwealth was first built, and has stood for this 700. years, as it appears by our Histories. 'Tis by this union that we have maintain'd a War for these many years, without the loss of any of our members; and that since our League, no Towns have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted, nor none of our Armies divided into parties: for which no better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be given, than that we have proceeded in all things justly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Constitution of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>For this reason that every one might share in the Government, we have granted to many small Towns, who formerly did not use to be call'd to the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64416:106"/>
generall Assemblies, the priviledge of sending their <hi>Deputies,</hi> and taking part in the administration of all affairs, that so they may the more willingly support the paying of Taxes, which they themselves shall have thought fit to impose.</p>
               <p>Upon the same score the <hi>Nobility</hi> has the liberty of assisting at these publick Assemblies, in such numbers as they please. Provided still they be of the body of the great Assembly, except those that are priviledg'd.</p>
               <p>If any body can prove that any of the <hi>Nobles</hi> or <hi>Deputies of Towns</hi> has gone beyond his Commission, or has come short of it, or any wayes fail'd in the trust put in him, he shall be bound to come in the presence of those that did depute him, and justifie himself; and in case he refuse, he shall be punish'd according to the rigour of the Law; and we shall think our selves oblig'd to those that shall accuse him, and bound to thank them, as true and faithfull lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Countrey.</p>
               <p>But as for those that do cast aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and forge calumnies against the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64416:106"/>
                  <hi>States,</hi> it is fit they should know that they are much mistaken, if they think to deal with the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Deputies of Towns,</hi> as with private men. For though they may be led away, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to deride their actions and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, innocently, and only to make sport; yet do we here declare, that those we shall find doing so malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and with a design of subverting our <hi>State,</hi> by vilifying the Governors thereof, we shall hold as enemies, and punish accordingly.</p>
               <p>Therefore be it known to all, that we that do here declare that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power is in the <hi>States,</hi> do not mean that it is in the <hi>Deputies,</hi> but in those that sent them, whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present by vertue of their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This is a truth which many Princes, and particularly her most Serene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> as also his Excellency the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> when he was sworn <hi>Governour,</hi> did both acknowledge. Neither do we think that any body can dispute so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant a verity; for else it would follow,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64416:107"/>
that the <hi>States</hi> have not, now they are free, so much power as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and not only the contracts made with the <hi>English,</hi> and the creation of the <hi>Governor Generall,</hi> would be inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, but all that the <hi>States</hi> have so nobly perform'd, since these fifteen years, would be unjust, which no body but our greatest enemies will, or dare say.</p>
               <p>From what has been said, it appears how great a necessity there is of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inviolable the Authority of the said <hi>States,</hi> as the foundation of all the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Commonwealth, and of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every body know, that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power is no less in them now than it was under their former Princes.

               <p>There was not above a hundred years ago a large Forrest in the Island of <hi>Texel,</hi> (which does as it were make up the tail of the Lion, which the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Provinces put together do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.) And to this day there are bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and stumps of Trees, which do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hurt Ships, and entangle their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles about their roots, which in a storm is often the cause of the loss of divers Ships; for that reason the Fishermen never cast their Nets there, for fear of tearing them.</p>
               <p>Some others say, and that probably enough, that the word <hi>Holland</hi> does denote the property of the Earth, which in most places seems hollow, and quakes as if it swam upon the top of the Water.

               </p>
               <p>The third opinion, and that which is most likely to be true, is, that these <hi>Provinces</hi> having been conquer'd by the <hi>Normans,</hi> they gave them the name of the <hi>Provinces</hi> they came out of. And in effect, not only whole Provinces, but many Towns and Villages have the same names here, and in <hi>Denemark,</hi> as <hi>Zeeland, Oland,</hi> besides the Kingdome of <hi>Norway;</hi> the Towns, as <hi>Schagen, Bergen, Valkenburg,</hi> and many others, which it is needless to set down.</p>
               <p>In all antiquity it is observable, that when ever a Nation did enlarge by Conquests or Colonies, the same cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome was put in use.

The Circuit of <hi>Holland</hi> is only a hundred and fourscore miles, and in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass are comprehended great Lakes, and a part of the South Sea. Its length is taken from the Island <hi>Schelling,</hi> in the North, to the River <hi>Scheld,</hi> and <hi>Zee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the South.

               <p>
                  <hi>HOlland</hi> is divided into the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>Meridionall part,</hi> which reaches from <hi>Zeeland, Brabant,</hi> and <hi>Utrect,</hi> to the Dike at <hi>Sparendam,</hi> and that is above half <hi>Holland;</hi> and into <hi>North-Holland,</hi> or <hi>West-Frieze,</hi> which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es from <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to the North Sea: and the people though penn'd up as it were in so small a compass, does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless differ very much in manners, customes, and Cloathes, in these parts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Kennemaers,</hi> which the Annals speak so much of, did live between
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64416:111"/>

                     </gap>k,</hi> and <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merend.</hi> There is a little Mountain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these Towns, which carries the name of St. <hi>Albert,</hi> and there the Earls were install'd Lords of the <hi>Kennemaers;</hi> and near that place they kept their Courts, as well because of the beauty of the Countrey, as for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many fair Castles that are built there, such as <hi>Cleves, Brederode, Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, Egmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Waterland</hi> is so call'd, because of the abundance of waters, on the top of which it seems to swim. There are in it but three little Towns, <hi>viz. Edam, Monnicken-dam,</hi> and <hi>Purmerend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That part of <hi>Holland</hi> which is nearest the North, has a soft moorish Soyl, not at all fit to be till'd. From the <hi>Downs</hi> to the Frontier of <hi>Brabant,</hi> 'tis nothing but Meadows, which towards the end of <hi>October</hi> begin to be cover'd with water, and which encreases by continuall rains and storms, and that lasts all Winter, insomuch that in most places you see nothing but some Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Houses, which look as if they came out of the Sea; all these fine Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64416:112"/>
being then cover'd with Boats, and the Dikes with Passengers. This Water does mightily fatten the ground; and in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> (provided the Frosts do not hinder it) begins to be emptied, by the admirable invention of those Wind-mills, which drive away these deluges of Water, and confine them to certain Channels. The Earth being dry begins about <hi>March</hi> to look green, and then the Cattell come out to grazing.</p>
               <p>Now it is to be observ'd, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Wind for <hi>Holland</hi> is the South-East, and the worst is the North-West.</p>
               <p>To prevent the dangerous effects of so much Water, this Countrey is full of Banks, rais'd by the industry of the Inhabitants, and which have cost vast summes of money to make, as they do still to maintain and keep in repair. The chief is the bank of the River <hi>Issel,</hi> that of the <hi>Meuse,</hi> of <hi>Sparendam,</hi> and of <hi>Medenblick.</hi> The care of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the <hi>Dyckgraves</hi> of each Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and to the <hi>Heemrades,</hi> who are Gentlemen of the Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:64416:112"/>
In the year 1638. the Dike of <hi>Issel</hi> broke by the thawing of the River; for the <hi>Rhyne</hi> carrying huge mountains of Ice, they eat into it, and made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Earth produces all sorts of Fruits and good Corn about <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>There are incomparably more Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows than arable grounds, which feed a world of Cattle; particularly a large sort of Cows, vvhich give great store of Milk, of which is made excellent But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and rare Cheeses, which are sent all the world over.

               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:64416:113"/>
Every Spring there comes great store of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>owe the Grass twice a year; and the Hay is much better than in any other place; it is for that reason, that the Horses and Cows are bigger and taller than in any other place.</p>
               <p>The Earth of which the Turss are made is call'd <hi>Veens,</hi> which being cut out of the Ditches, and exposed to the Sun-beams, grows hard, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept some time in a Barn or Garret, grows dry, and fit for fewell. The best are those that come from <hi>Frieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and they use them in Brewing and Baking. They have all much sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure in them, and being mingled with Wood, make an excellent fire.</p>
               <p>The mountains of Sand call'd <hi>Downs,</hi> serve as a bar to the fury of the Ocean; and though they seem barren, yet have they an advantage, which is, that they are full of Rabbits, which are both a pleasant diversion, and a good provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Passengers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:64416:113"/>
The Sea-side from the <hi>Meuse</hi> to the <hi>Texel</hi> is about a hundred miles in length; and there is so plain and smooth a way between the Mountains and the Sea, that it is a great pleasure to travell in it either afoot or on Horse-back. When the Sea is calm, you may see the Ships under sail; and if there be a storm, it is with a kind of terrible delight, that you may perceive the threatning Sea come, and spend all its fury upon this even shore.</p>
               <p>There are some pleasant Forrests standing yet, as that of the <hi>Hague</hi> and <hi>Harlem.</hi> There is likewise a Wood at <hi>Sevenhuyse,</hi> a fine Village five leagues from <hi>Leyden,</hi> where the Scholars go twice a year to take the sport of shaking the Trees, and making a great sort of Bird that builds in them fall at their feet.</p>
               <p>It is most certain that this <hi>Province</hi> was anciently full of Trees, which (according to the opinion of some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) were destroyed by that horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble storm, which hapned in the year 860. and which shut up the mouth of the River <hi>Rhene</hi> near <hi>Lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64416:114"/>
take another course, and mingle with the <hi>Meuse,</hi> after a great devastation of Woods, Lands, and Houses. In proof whereof you see that the Channell that comes from <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rect,</hi> and passes through <hi>Leyden,</hi> retains yet the name of the <hi>Rhyne.</hi> The Countrey people in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging do find to this day in the <hi>Veens,</hi> and other places, great bodies and branches of Trees, particularly towards the South. Nay they have found Nuts entire and well preserv'd in the bottom of the Water, though there has been no Trees to bear them since this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is no wonder that a Countrey formerly over-run with Wood, should now be so empty of it, since we know that <hi>Germany</hi> which is now so full of Towns and Cities, was anciently one great Forrest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.</p>
               <p>The Air is pretty well temper'd in <hi>Holland,</hi> though cold do a little predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, there being continuall winds and frequent rains; but the inconstancy of the Climate is such, that the seasons seem to be in a perpetuall confusion.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64416:114"/>
It rains ordinarily in the Dog-dayes; and sometimes in <hi>July</hi> it is as cold as in <hi>December.</hi> Likewise in Winter it is sometimes so warm and milde weather, that one can hardly endure a fire: but as the heat is never violent, so the cold is seldome lasting, according to the Proverb that sayes, that <hi>rigorous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters do not govern long;</hi> yet is there no such generall Rule but admits of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; for there has been long and hot Summers, and violent cold lasting Winters: the Annals speak of some, as of the year 1149.</p>
               <p>When the Channels are frozen, they slide upon them with a certain sort of Shooes call'd <hi>Skates,</hi> which have a long, shining, narrow, crooked Iron, that stands out before. They that are perfect in this exercise turn their Feet inwards, that the Iron may take the more hold of the Ice, upon which they fly like Birds in the air with that swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that one can hardly follow them with the eye. The Women too use this as a diversion, and many do very pretty tricks upon the Ice; but most are content with a straight course, as
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64416:115"/>
much as needs to get heat and ground. Every Sunday after Sermon all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Towns come out upon the Ice, some to slide and others to look on. I knew a young Clown of ten year old, who did brag <hi>that he had gone eighteen miles or six leagues in an hour</hi> upon his Skates. The same laid a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with a Peasant his neighbour, that he would sooner slide three leagues, than the other should ride one and a half with the best Horse he should get. It is ordinary for these sort of people to go from <hi>Leyden</hi> to <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in an hour and a quarter, if the Ice be even, and yet that is near eighteen miles.</p>
               <p>There are besides things call'd <hi>Trais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaur,</hi> like our Sledges, that are of two sorts, some that are drawn by Horses, and others that a man drives before him as he slides upon the Ice. There are also Boats, that having a great Iron under them, sail along, and go sometimes fifteen leagues an hour; but that is seldome practis'd, because there is danger in it, and because that often the Ice is not even.</p>
               <p>When it has snowed and frozen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64416:115"/>
they use great Sledges to go across the Meadows, and not follow the ordinary way. Some wonder to see the Countrey people carry great Poles upon their Shoulders; but the reason of it is, that if the Ice should break, they might by the favour of their Poles, (both ends of which would lye upon the two extremities of the crack'd Ice) get out again. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> deserves to be blam'd; for many will venture upon one nights Ice, and thence happen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sad accidents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holland</hi> is so flat and even a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that you see not a Mountain nor a Hill, except those Sand-hills that keep out the Sea. It is almost all Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, cut into a thousand Channels, which in Summer by their delicate green, and their variety of Flowers, are a pleasant object to look on. 'Tis true, that in some places the Earth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Corn, Beans, Pease, and all sorts of grains; the Mountains of Sand are full of Rabbits; the Waters of excellent Fishes; and the Air supplyes them with Fowl from the Northern
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64416:116"/>
parts, <hi>viz.</hi> with <hi>Woodcocks, Snipes, Hernes,</hi> &amp;c. insomuch that <hi>Holland</hi> may be call'd very justly, <hi>the Marrow of the Low Countreys,</hi> as well for its fertility, as for the delights and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures that may be enjoyed in it. It seems a terrestriall Paradise for its Meadows and pleasant Fields, the Channels and Rivers so ingeniously contriv'd for Trade, and the noble magnificence of its Buildings. We must needs confess that there are very few plow'd grounds, considering the vast numbers of people that must be fed; and yet there are no where great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Store-houses, nor better furnish'd than here: nay <hi>Holland</hi> may with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be call'd <hi>the Store-house of Europe,</hi> considering the vast transportation of all sorts of grains that are made from hence into <hi>Italy, Spain, England, France,</hi> and <hi>Brabant,</hi> when their own Corn has fail'd them by any accident of War or Famine.</p>
               <p>That great Man <hi>Scaliger</hi> speaking of the Wonders of this <hi>Province,</hi> sayes, <hi>that here grows no Vines, and yet here is more Wine than in any one place in</hi> Europe.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64416:116"/>
In effect, the Wines of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> the <hi>Mosella,</hi> and the <hi>Mouse,</hi> come to <hi>Dort,</hi> and from thence into all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of these Countreys. The Wines of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> come to <hi>Amsterdam</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There grows very little Wood, and yet there are no where to be found more Carpenters and Joyners than here. And it may be there is not in the rest of Chrystendome, so many Ships and Boats as in this one <hi>Province:</hi> there is scarce a Peasant but has his Boat to bring his Commodities to the Towns. To be short; sayes he, <hi>we live amongst the waters, and yet we drink not of them.</hi> There are no Flocks of Sheep, and very little Flax; and yet where is made more Cloth and Linnen than here? I adde, that there are no Mines in <hi>Holland,</hi> and yet all sorts of Mettals are more abundant here than in any part of the world, as it appears by the rich Furnitures and Ornaments of the Houses of our Citizens, whose Wives delight in that more than in any thing else.</p>
               <p>Strangers cannot easily conceive
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64416:117"/>
these wonders, or at least they alone amongst them that understand the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of Trade, and what vast advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have reap'd from that War, which they so long and so generously maintain'd against <hi>Spain,</hi> and which at last ending in an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able peace, has left them Masters of the Trade of the world, fetching by their Ships from the remotest parts of it all that's good and precious, and to be had for money.</p>

                  <p>Of the Manners and Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Inhabitants.</p>

               <p>THe old <hi>Hollanders</hi> were formerly despised by their Neighbours, for the grossness of their temper, and the simplicity of their life. They were us'd to be call'd <hi>Block-heads, and eaters of Cheese and Milk:</hi> but as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had the reputation of silly, so now they are esteemed as subtil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64416:117"/>
a Nation as any is in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi> as may be well evidenced from their Treaties and Alliances made with Strangers. This I think proceeds from that Commerce they drive through all the world, and from the mixture made amongst them by divers Strangers that have setled in these parts; for above half those that do inhabit the Towns are either Strangers, or descended from them.</p>
               <p>They all love their Liberties, even those that have made but a few years stay in the <hi>Province,</hi> as if the genius of it had a secret power over mens inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is not lawfull to beat nor strike any body. Servants have as great priviledges as their Masters, who dare not abuse them with blows. And if any body chance to be so far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported by their passion, as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>There are no Slaves in <hi>Holland,</hi> but
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:64416:118"/>
any man in that condition is free as soon as he sets his foot on that ground. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are very constant in their resolutions, and seldome desist till they have obtain'd their end.</p>
               <p>They are not so much upon the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio of honor, as the other Nations, but are rather given to Trade and getting, and they seem as if they had suck'd in with their milk the insatiable desire of acquiring. They never complain of the pains they take, and go as merrily to the <hi>Indies,</hi> as if they went to their Countrey Houses. They are of a strong Constitution, tall proper men, and very capable of whatsoever they undertake.</p>
               <p>Those amongst them that prefer the study of Liberal Arts to the desire of growing rich, do succeed as prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously; for without doubt or flattery, <hi>Holland</hi> has produced as many learn'd and ingenious persons as any Province in <hi>Europe.</hi> Others follow the Art of Painting, and transport themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> where are the best Masters of the world; and by these means good Pictures are very common here, there
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64416:118"/>
being scarce an ordinary Tradesman, whose House is not adorn'd with them. If there be any body that has any new invention or discovery, he shall be sure to find money for it here, if it will yeeld any.</p>
               <p>Above all things the <hi>Hollander,</hi> hate all Quarrels and Duels; as likewise they abhor all treacherous actions, blasphemy, swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are no wayes bloody-minded, but much more enclin'd to compassion than their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>I pass to their way of living. And first of their Winter-Provision.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of Autumn when the Turfs are dry, they lay in their provision of them. Towards <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> they buy an Oxe, or half a one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their Family is, that they salt and smoke for Summer, eating it with Butter or Sallet. Every Sunday they take out a great piece out of their salting-Tub, upon which they dine: this piece comes every day after upon the Table all the week long, with some other Dish of boyl'd Meat, or Milk. They do not love Pottage so much as
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64416:119"/>
the <hi>French;</hi> neither do they much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem Leek, or Garlick, or Onion. They are not nice in their Diet, and none amongst them, but the very rich, do eat after the <hi>French fashion.</hi>

               <p>They have that common custome of all <hi>Northern</hi> Nations, which is, that they delight much in drinking and feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their friends; if any chance to be quarrelsome in his drink, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently driven out of the Company. Here we must not omit a certain cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, which has for drift, peace, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and concord: All the Towns are divided into divers Quarters, called <hi>Neighbourhoods;</hi> every one of these has a <hi>Master,</hi> and he has his <hi>Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors;</hi> if there happen any quarrell, the parties appear before him, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to agree them; if he cannot, then they may go twice a week before the Commissioners for hearing of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and keeping peace amongst Neighbours; if they cannot bring them to take or give satisfaction, then they may go to Law.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Treasurer</hi> of each <hi>Neighbourhood</hi> receives the Fines, which are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64416:119"/>
If any one has not waited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a dead body of the Neighbourhood going to be buried, he is fin'd three half-pence. The Heirs or Kindred of the dead person are bound to make a Present, according to their quality, though there be no set Tax. For a Childe they give not so much as for a person of age. The gift that is made for a married person, is call'd in the language of the Countrey a <hi>fat Dish.</hi> When a Citizen purchases a House, he is bound to a Present proportionable to the value of his House.</p>
               <p>When there is a pretty round summe of money got together by six or seven years gathering, the <hi>Master</hi> and his <hi>Counsellors</hi> meet at the desire of the Neighbours, and appoint a day for a Treat, which lasts ordinarily three or four. 'Tis most commonly in Autumn, and there every one comes with his Wife, but without either Children or Dogs, under pain of being fined. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they sit down, the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Feast are publickly read; amongst which the chiefest are, that <hi>you must not blaspheme, nor start any discourse about
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64416:120"/>
Religion, for fear of falling out.</hi> Then the <hi>Master</hi> sits down with his Wife, and the <hi>Counsellors</hi> next to him of each side; the others draw lots for their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If any one press another to drink more than he is able, he payes a Fine; if he strike, he is banish'd the company, and not admitted the next day without asking pardon. At eight of the Clock every one goes out, and waits upon the <hi>Master</hi> to his Lodging, where they begin to drink afresh, till wine and sleep part them, and bring them to their own homes. All the time is pass'd merrily, and without Ceremony, as if they were all equall. The four dayes being ended, they summe up what they have spent; and if the publick purse cannot pay the charges, they supply it by an equall contribution. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited this custome at large, that from it may be deduced some knowledge of their humour. They are very patient, and not so hasty as other Nations, and have a Proverb amongst them, which sayes, that <hi>Rich people do not use to fight.</hi> They ha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e going to Law; and as for affronts and injurious words they are
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64416:120"/>
made amends for, by the recantation and confession of him that is in the wrong; then they shake hands, and are made friends.</p>
               <p>The married Women and Maids are very fair and chaste. They have a great care of their House, and keep all their Cupboards, Cabinets, even the Floors, extream neat: some of them are so curious, as not to let you come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their rubb'd Rooms, without putting on a pair of Slippers, or making your own Shooes very clean. The Women do enjoy as much liberty as their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; and it is an unpardonable fault to beat them. I have often heard them say, that if a Husband does beat his Wife, he is bound to give his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours a Gammon of Bacon; and if she beat him, she is bound to give two. Every day they rub and wash the lower Floors, and straw them with fine Sand, and make them so neat, that Strangers often make a scruple of spitting in them. If the Citizens Wives are thus neat, the Countrey people are no wayes inferior to them in that point; for they keep all even to their Stables very clean. The
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64416:121"/>
Houshold-stuff of the better sort is very rich, of gold and silver, and carv'd work; good Hangings; excellent Pictures; rare Cabinets, fill'd with <hi>China,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I have observ'd one thing of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> by living long amongst them, which is, that they do not easily give credit to such as tell strange Stories and wonderfull accidents, hapned a great way off; and when, by their silence and postures, they seem to admire it, 'tis then that they believe least of all what you say, but they do not take pleasure in contradicting. They are not given to swearing, nor robbing; but are tender-hearted, and inclin'd to pity, and will not willingly see any body wrong'd in their presence.</p>
               <p>They are a little too indulgent to their Children, and are punished for it; for many of them rebell against their Parents, and at last go away to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> the ordinary vent of these <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> When any body tells them of their fondness to their Children, they presently say, <hi>Does any body spoil their own Face, or cut off their own Nose?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:64416:121"/>
They are very laborious and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious, and in the name of liberty and profit undertake any thing. They love familiarity, and are much taken with people that being of great quality do not refuse to eat and drink with them. Prince <hi>William</hi> the first, Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> won their hearts with that popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way, and did the King of <hi>Spain</hi> more mischief by it, than if he had been at the head of an Army against him. They despise and undervalue proud people; and to please them, you must conform to their humour. They are very free, and open apparently, but are indeed alwayes upon their guard. They hate cheats, and are seldome deceiv'd twice.</p>
               <p>Those amongst them that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from Strangers, do retain something of their first origine, and are a good while before they become <hi>right Hollanders.</hi>

               <p>We have spoke already of their Diet; but this is only to be added, that Trade having brought riches, sumptuosity has followed: so that the <hi>Hague</hi> may be call'd a compendium of the most

                  <p>Of the Trade of the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> and the wayes of getting a Livelyhood.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is an ordinary saying in <hi>Holland,</hi> that <hi>He that will work can never want,</hi> and it is a very true one; for there are so many Trades kept going by their great commerce, that no body can want work. All Arts are here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised; and experience shews, that Manufactures are better made here than in the other <hi>Provinces.</hi> All turns to account here; and even they that make clean the Kennals with an Iron, and Nets at the end of it to bring up the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, may earn half a Crown a day, if they will work hard. Children, as so on as they are bound Apprentice, get their
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64416:122"/>
own bread. Amongst the Countrey people, some make Butter and Cheese; others cut up Turfs; every Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day they bring their Milk, and Butter, and Whey to Town, which the Tradesmen and Journeymen live most upon.</p>
               <p>Among the Citizens, some put out their Money, and live upon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; others trade with it, and are call'd <hi>Merchants.</hi> Their chief Commodities are Butter, and Cheese, and Cloth, and many other Manufactures, as we shall see in the Description of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The situation of this noble <hi>Province</hi> is such, as if Nature intended it for the generall Mart of <hi>Europe;</hi> for it has the neighbourhood of the Sea, and is it self full of navigable Lakes, Rivers, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, all which are night and day loaded with Boats and Passengers. Many Channels have been made since the publication of the peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> as that from <hi>Leyden</hi> to <hi>Harlem,</hi> and from <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to <hi>Goude,</hi> which is call'd <hi>(Trech-Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>)</hi> because there the Boats are drawn by Horses, that so
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64416:123"/>
they may come in at set-times. The said Channels are made with the greatest ease that can be; for as soon as you have digg'd three or four foot, you meet with the water.</p>
               <p>The Herring-Fishing is properly the golden Mines of this Countrey, by the great revenue it brings yearly to it. It is a hard matter to say how many thousands of men are kept by it; for besides those that go to Sea, who are a great number, there are employed as many more in making of Boats and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels to pickle them up in.</p>
               <p>Every Summer in <hi>June</hi> there sets out a Fleet of Fishermen from the <hi>Meuse;</hi> they call them <hi>Busses.</hi> They cast their Nets near the <hi>English</hi> Coast upon <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer-Eve,</hi> according to the ancient custome; they pickle them up in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and serve all the rest of the world with them: the last Fishing is most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, and the Herrings of that Fishing are all carried abroad. Ten dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Midsummer</hi> they may sell them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, but not before; then many go up and down, crying, Fresh Herring, which are esteem'd as a dainty by every
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64416:123"/>
body. The name of the man that first invented the way of pickleing them, deserves to be known; it was <hi>William Bueckeld,</hi> and he died at <hi>Bieverliet,</hi> in the year 1347. <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror went one day to see his Tomb, in acknowledgment of the service he had done his Countrey.</p>
               <p>The Merchants do every day encrease their Trade by making <hi>Societies</hi> and <hi>Companies,</hi> and setting out men of War at their own charges to protect their Ships home. They never want Seamen, for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> do delight in going to Sea; nay I have heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them say, that they could never enjoy their health but at Sea. There are many of these <hi>Companies;</hi> as that of <hi>Moscovy,</hi> for Furrs, Skins, and Rye; that of <hi>Island</hi> and <hi>Groenland,</hi> for the fishing of Whales: but the chiefest of all, and who with Force and Arms drive a prodigious Trade, are the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-India</hi> Companies, who have a Patent from the <hi>States.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>West-India</hi> Company had made great profit by the taking of the <hi>Baia de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64416:124"/>
which <hi>Jason Peter Hain</hi> brought into <hi>Holland,</hi> in the year 1629. which also was the cause of the taking of <hi>Bosleduke</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The taking of <hi>Fernambuco</hi> did likewise give hopes of conquering the rest of <hi>Brasil;</hi> but after the depart of the noble Count <hi>Morice</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> the <hi>Negroes</hi> and <hi>Portugueses</hi> joyning together, revolted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>Company</hi> to great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; since it has suffer'd another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, which has almost made an end of ruining it. It has often been proposed to unite it with the <hi>East-India</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but all in vain, for the one is too high and rich, and the other too poor.</p>
               <p>The <hi>East-India</hi> Company has its principall Seat at <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> 'Tis this Company that has Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes tributary to it, and depending upon it. 'Tis this Company that makes the <hi>Hollanders</hi> name famous in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest parts of the Earth, and triumphs over the riches of the Orient, bringing home Pearls, Diamonds, Gold, all sorts of Aromatick Druggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Batavia,</hi> the principall Town,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64416:124"/>
the Company has a great number of strong Forts well in order, to protect their Merchants, terrifie Strangers, and keep the <hi>Indians</hi> in awe. 'Tis thought that the Company payes above 10000 men; the places and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are much valued, and not to be come by but by the intercession of some great friend.</p>
               <p>Every Summer about <hi>August</hi> there comes in an <hi>East-India</hi> Fleet of ten or twelve Ships, which is esteem'd to bring in the value of above a million of gold. The prohibitions that <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> made to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> from tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his Countrey, were the cause of this Enterprize. 'Tis said that the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>etians</hi> did counsell and further it for a design, which succeeded otherwise than they expected, and to their own loss. The Ships that go for the <hi>Indies</hi> are of extraordinary bulk. Every one that has put in a thousand pounds may be a <hi>Director;</hi> and every one that has a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds there, may have three hundred for it; and every hundred yeelds forty and forty five, sometimes more, sometimes less. The riches of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64416:125"/>
this Company are inestimable; and to go about to describe them, were to desire credit to a thing which to most people would seem fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, though they are very reall in themselves.</p>
               <p>All the Channels render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Lakes, and they into the Sea. There are two chief o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures to the Ocean; the first is the mouth of the River <hi>Meuse,</hi> which is at the <hi>Brill,</hi> and <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Of the Imposts and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THough <hi>Holland</hi> be both naturally, and by the greatness of its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, aboundant in all things; yet every thing is extream dear, and that for two reasons; first, because of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64416:125"/>
greatness of the Consumption, caus'd by the affluence of people from all parts; the other, because of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise which is upon every thing almost, and which is easily supported by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, by reason of the great gains every one is able to make in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. These Imposts are so layed and gather'd, that they are willingly payed, though there be nothing free from them. The Money that is thus rais'd, comes to a vast summe, which added to the situation of the Countrey, has made all the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours vain. But to shew the greatness of this Tribute, I will give only this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: A Cow of nine years old, if it be sold for five pound, will have payed above six pound to the <hi>States.</hi> There is never a Dish comes to Table, but has payed excise above twenty times. The <hi>States</hi> seeing the necessity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving money to defend their liberties, did by little and little, and not all at once, settle these Excises, so that the people bear it chearfully enough. In the time of the War, every one pay'd the two hundredth penny of their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64416:126"/>
Estates; they only that were not worth two hundred pound principall, were exempted from this contribution. There are many other Imposts, which may be all seen in the Second Part of this Book, in the Chapter of <hi>Imposts.</hi> All that is wonderfull, is to consider that that very thing for the fear of which these Nations revolted from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> has been put in execution in a higher manner upon themselves, by their own consent, and prov'd the means of their preservation.</p>
               <p>Let us now come to the description of particular Towns; and let us begin by <hi>Leyden,</hi> which is to the rest, as the Spring is to the other seasons of the year, the gayest, and most pleasant. Towns in other Countries are subject to the injuries of time and revolutions, but here they spring up, encrease, and grow bigger every day. This Town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, has had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be one of the most flourishing of the <hi>Low Countreys.</hi> The Ocean is on the West-side of it, and within twelve miles; <hi>Harlem</hi> on the North, within fifteen; and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> within one
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64416:126"/>
and twenty; <hi>Utrect</hi> within thirty, towards the East; <hi>Delft</hi> and the <hi>Hague</hi> on the South and South-West, and within nine miles distance.</p>

               <p>THis Town, the greatest and most pleasant that is in <hi>Europe,</hi> (if we consider the magnificence of its Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the breadth of its Streets, the conveniencies of its Channels, and the pleasing shade of the Trees planted on each side the Channels) is situated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ancient River of <hi>Rhene,</hi> which goes through it, makes many Islands, and then joyns in one bed at the white Gate. It is almost in the Center of <hi>Holland,</hi> and from it we will draw lines to the rest of the Cities, which are as it were the circumference.

whence many derive the word <hi>Leyden</hi> from <hi>Legio,</hi> there being there a <hi>Roman</hi> Legion in quarters.

               <p>The <hi>Burg-graves</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their name from this <hi>Burg,</hi> which is round and high, and from it one may discover all the adjacent Meadows, the sandy Downs, and the Sea of <hi>Harlem.</hi> The ascent to it is by steps, and round about it as well as within are Fruit-Trees in abundance. It has about a hundred and fifty foot in compass; and within these few years there has been bred up Hedges all trimm'd, and cut into Labyrinths, which in a short time will make it a very recreative place.</p>
               <p>In the year 1121. the great Church was consecrated to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> 'tis one of the finest Churches in <hi>Holland,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving three ranks of Pillars on each side without the Quire. It is said that there was a high Tower, which serv'd as a

Light-House to those that were at Sea, and pass'd before <hi>Catvic,</hi> but it fell down in the year 1509.</p>
               <p>In the year 1344. the Church dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>Pancratius,</hi> was bless'd; it is a stately Building, so much of it as is done.

A little after having recruited their Army, they came again under the conduct of their Generall <hi>Baldese,</hi> who judging that it would be a hard matter to take the Town by force, resolv'd to starve them to a surrender. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants endur'd all the extremities of famine, and at last the banks that kept in the Rivers <hi>Meuse</hi> and <hi>Issel,</hi> being broke on purpose by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were forced to forsake their Trenches. The first relief came

into the Town the third of <hi>October,</hi> which is still made an anniversary day of Thanksgiving.

I will adde, that as <hi>Leyden</hi> has been the second Town that sustain'd valiantly the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> attacks, so the Sas of <hi>Gand</hi> was the last place but one which fell into the <hi>States</hi> hands, and that by the fault of the Governor, who was not able to make use of his Sluces, against those who by
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64416:128"/>
water had driven the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from their Walls.</p>
               <p>A year after this painfull siege, was establish'd the famous University of <hi>Leyden,</hi> to recompence the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants for their constant sufferings. But many other reasons might invite the <hi>States</hi> to choose this Town before any other; for it is neat, finely built, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Walks, and a pleasant Countrey about the Town, the Sea near it. The University was inaugurated the eighth of <hi>February,</hi> in the year 1574. and every year upon the same day is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd <hi>Rector,</hi> he whom his Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> is pleas'd to choose, out of three that are nam'd to him.</p>
               <p>Here has alwayes been very famous professors in all faculties; but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Civil Law and Physick have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes flourished, by the particular care of his Highness the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> The great <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and the incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Salmazius,</hi> have been as the two great Lights among the other Stars of this learn'd Firmament. There are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Lectures of Divinity, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64416:129"/>
in all which the professors do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, as being chosen with care, and well recompenc'd for their labours. When any one dies, the three <hi>Curators</hi> provide another of the same faculty; so the University is alwayes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>Those Students that are written in the University-Book do enjoy great priviledges. They that are above twenty year old, may have fourscore quarts of Wine in a year, which pay no excise, and half a barrell of Beer every moneth free likewise. They give a groat to the Servants of the University every quarter.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rector</hi> or <hi>Chancellor</hi> has his <hi>Counsellors,</hi> before whom are brought all quarrels, and they endeavour to make the parties agree; if they will not, then they may go to a triall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the University-<hi>Counsell,</hi> where the <hi>Rector</hi> presides, and decides without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal in civil matters. If any of the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have committed a crime that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves death or otherwise, the Officers of justice cannot take him before they have the <hi>Rectors</hi> consent; and then too
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64416:129"/>
they may not carry him to a loathsome prison, but into the Town-House Hall.</p>
               <p>Duels are severely prohibited, ever since a <hi>Danish</hi> Student was kill'd in one. Besides they are forbid to commit any riot in the night time, or break the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens Windows, under pain of a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Fine, and often of being ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd.</p>
               <p>There is a Watch goes on purpose to hinder such disorders, which takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Scholars Swords if they be inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and carries them to prison, where next day they are produc'd before the University-<hi>Counsell.</hi> There are also as good Masters for all Exercises, as Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Dancing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as any where, and the <hi>Italian, French,</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongues are taught excellently well. Here are Students of all Nations of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> most of them Gentlemen of good Families; and often Princes, and great Lords Sons, have been seen to come hither for their education. They all have a dependance upon the <hi>Rector;</hi> and to this day never any Member of the University was put to death, except a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64416:130"/>
servant to a Prince, who confess'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be the author of a murder that had been committed.</p>
               <p>The University has Schools for the different Lectures; and on the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the great Court, is the famous Printing Press of <hi>John Elzevier,</hi> so well known for his fair Characters. It is placed upon the <hi>Rapembourg,</hi> the fairest Street of all the Town; for in the middle of it runs a large Channell, and of each side is a rowe of tall Trees from one end to the other. The Pavy has a little fall towards the Channell, so that it can never be dirty let there fall never so much rain. There are five fair Bridges over this Channell, and abundance of delicate Houses on each side. 'Tis not only this Street that is thus shaded, but all the Town; so that he was in the right that desir'd to know, whether <hi>Leyden was in a Wood, or a Wood in</hi> Leyden. We should never have done if I would particularize all the singularities of <hi>Leyden:</hi> the great and most frequented Street begins at the Gate of the <hi>Hague,</hi> and ends at <hi>Utrect</hi> Gate; it is the broadest and highest
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64416:130"/>
Street of the Town. The most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable next is <hi>Harlem</hi> Street, which has a Channell call'd the old <hi>Rhene,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which all the other Channels do fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, and which ends it self at <hi>Catvic.</hi> It is adorn'd with four stone Bridges, one of which is the largest and fairest of all the Town: it is call'd the <hi>Corn-Bridge,</hi> because that on every Market-day the Countrey people take up their stations upon it with their Corn. There is another likewise call'd the <hi>Fish-Bridge,</hi> because the Fishermen do there expose their Sea-Fish to sale. The best Fish comes from <hi>Catvic;</hi> that of <hi>Maeslant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sluys</hi> is not valued, as being ordinarily stale.</p>
               <p>If this City had but running Water, a great Market-place, and some foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of clear Water for drink, it would be the pleasantest in all <hi>Europe;</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be <hi>ex omni parte beatum,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd in all points. There has been lately built a Church in a circular figure, admir'd by all Strangers for its incomparable Architecture both within and without. The first Sermon was preach'd in it some weeks before <hi>Easter,</hi> in the year 1650.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:64416:131"/>
The Town is so populous, by reason that poor people of the neighbouring Countries do seek a refuge here in time of War, that it is a hard matter to get a Chamber in the new Town. Here is the great manufacture of that excellent Cloths which are transported all the world over; they cannot make any such any where else. The fine Wool comes from <hi>Spain,</hi> and the course from <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Pom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rania.</hi> All sorts of Nations work in the manufacture, where many other Stuffs are made.</p>
               <p>In Summer during the hot weather, these Channels do send forth a noysome smell, particularly when the weather inclines to rain; the reason of it is, the drying up of the Lake of <hi>Soetermeer,</hi> which did use to cleanse the Town by flowing into it. To prevent this, the Magistrates have caus'd two large Channels to be made, and two Mills to be set upon them, to drive the Water into the Town at one end, and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that drive or carry it out at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end; so that by this invention the City is free'd from that noysom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious smell, though often it fail too
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64416:131"/>
in the great heat of Summer, when there is a great calm, and no winde stirring.</p>
               <p>We must not omit to speak of the <hi>Anatomy-House;</hi> it being the place that ought most to attract Strangers eyes, for the singular curiosities that are in it. There you shall see <hi>Egyptian</hi> Mummiaes, <hi>Pagan</hi> Idols, Birds and Beasts brought from <hi>China,</hi> and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter places, whole Skeletons, and an infinite number of other things, which cannot be here set down, no more than viewed, in a short time. In the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of this Church, above the Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-School that was, and is now the <hi>English</hi> Church, there is a fine Library full of all sorts of Books in all Tongues; besides the Legacy of great <hi>Scaliger,</hi> which is a number of <hi>Hebrew</hi> Books; all the Manuscripts of the Library of <hi>Bonaventure, Vulcan,</hi> and the Books that <hi>Golias</hi> brought out of the <hi>Levant.</hi> There are other private Libraries, which the civility of the owners makes publick: and it is not only the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, but even the Citizens that are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Libraries; insomuch that if Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64416:132"/>
were lost else-where, they would soon be restor'd by the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are often Libraries publickly sold to them that give most for them; and this way of exposing all sorts of Goods to publick sale, is very ordinary in <hi>Holland,</hi> and they that buy them have credit for some moneths.</p>
               <p>The City has eight Gates all new, with their Bridges. The Galleries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Town-Ditch are set with Trees, having on one side the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and on the other are the Gardens and Meadows near the Town.</p>
               <p>The City was very un-inhabited for a great while after the siege; the Grass did grow in the Streets, and most of the Houses were thatch'd: but now they are all cover'd with Tile, or blew Slate; and since the year 1636. this Town is embelish'd, and grown better by half in half.</p>
               <p>There is an Hospitall for poor Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and decayed old people; as also a Bedlam or place for mad folks; all being very neatly kept, and the sick well serv'd. The Orphans Hospitall
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64416:132"/>
is a noble Building, and of a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. In it are ordinarily about 500. Children, who are taught to read and write, and bound Apprentices as they grow up. Besides this, there are great numbers of Alms-Houses for poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they call them <hi>Hoffies</hi> in <hi>Dutch:</hi> the fairest of these is the <hi>Pape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The care that is taken in <hi>Holland</hi> of such Families as cannot get their living, is very remarkable, and deserves praise. In the Winter time there are deliver'd to them at the publick charge, so many Blankets, Sheets, so much Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to keep them from dying either by cold or hunger. They that are either over-burdened with Children, or otherwise undone by any accident, go to the Masters of the poor, and receive relief according to their necessities. But this charity is not extended to the poor Catholicks, though the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be made generally, and from all Religions. The number of those that have a share in this charity mounts ordinarily to above 20000. in this City.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:64416:133"/>
Every quarter the Magistrate goes through the Town, having before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand given notice to the Citizens, and makes a collection of what every one is pleas'd to bestow. And thus all the poor are so supplied, that in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity they cannot want Bread, and so cannot from their necessity take an occasion of rising. This is practis'd through all <hi>Holland;</hi> but no where so exactly as at <hi>Leyden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1629. the King of <hi>Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> having landed an Army in <hi>Borus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> stopt all the Rivers, and hindred the coming of Corn from <hi>Poland;</hi> whereupon Bread grew so dear of a sudden, that the common people not being able to go to the price, began to mutiny, and some of them broke in upon a Baker. But immediately the Citizens appearing in Arms, dissipated this tumultuous rabble, and having whipt two or three of them, made the rest go quietly home. Then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates gave out Rye to the Bakers, to distribute to such poor as should bring such a mark in testimony of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:64416:133"/>
Every year in <hi>April</hi> the Magistrates go through all the Town, and every one must set forth before his door his Fire-Ladder, Buckets, and Sayl, to the end that if Fire should happen any where, it might be readily extinguish'd. This is a very laudable custome, and observ'd over all <hi>Holland.</hi> All night long in Winter, from nine of the clock to four in the morning, there are men that go through every Street with a Bell, singing the hours and half-hours. They are bound to convey to their Lodgings all drunken people, and such as have lost their way. They take care against Fires; give warning to those that have not shut their doors.</p>
               <p>In Summer they begin at ten of the clock, and retire at four in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They that set upon them or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front them, are severely punish'd; as was seen lately at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where a great Lord having in drink kill'd one of them, was notwithstanding all power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full intercessions, beheaded, to be an example to every one else.</p>
               <p>The Magistrates that administer ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice are chosen out of the forty <hi>Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:64416:134"/>
all Protestants, and rich Citizens. Out of these are chosen every year four <hi>Bourgemasters</hi> at St. <hi>Martins</hi> Feast in <hi>November,</hi> and seven <hi>Aldermen</hi> on St. <hi>James</hi> day in <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is besides another Assembly, call'd the <hi>Masters of the Pupils and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans;</hi> before whom such Men or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that have Children, but desire to marry again, must appear, and take their Oath that they have conceal'd no part of their Estate, but that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory is good and true; and then the Parents are bound to breed them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their quality, and to assign them a summe of Money upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, proportionable to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall.</p>
               <p>The Towns has besides, its <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers</hi> and <hi>Surveyors</hi> for Building; that when any thing, as Bridges or Gates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> requires repair, it may be speedily done.</p>
               <p>Every year there are two great Fairs at <hi>Leyden,</hi> during which time no man can be arrested for Debt. The chiefest is held on <hi>Ascension</hi> day, and lasts eight dayes. Upon the Monday the Citizens
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64416:134"/>
meet in the <hi>Dozles,</hi> a place full of Trees, where every one may exercise in shooting with Cross-bowes, and Bowes and Arrows. It is a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant place, by reason of the shady Walks, and of two good Taverns that are in it; in the Windows of one of which are represented all the Earls of <hi>Holland,</hi> down to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain.</hi> In most of the Towns of <hi>Holland</hi> there are of these <hi>Dozles,</hi> which shews the warlike temper of these Nations, so far as to be able to preserve their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>In this place the six Companies of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, which make near 2000 men, do use to train. The most ancient Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain has the Van. They appear with great glory, and perform their Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses very well.</p>
               <p>The other Fair is that which us'd to be held in memory of the deliverance of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and was wont to last ten dayes; but it is now put down, and the Story only represented in a Tragedie, to which there is great flocking.</p>
               <p>Now let us say something about their way of selling Houses, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:64416:135"/>
'Tis ordinarily about the end of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> till <hi>February,</hi> that Houses are to be sold. There is a note set up decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the situation of the House, the Owner, the Neighbours, the name of him that lives in it, and his Trade; and lastly, the House where the Bargain is to be driven on a set day. The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, all those that have a mind to it come to the House appointed, which is ordinarily a Tavern. And thus the business is managed:</p>
               <p>An Attorney with a Cryer goes through all the Chambers, where there is Company, reads the Conditions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it is to be sold, and declares whether there be any Rent charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it or no. The Cryer asks them if they have all heard, and observ'd well what has been read, and who amongst them will se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> a price upon the House. For example, a House shall be worth 600. pound; and in the first Chamber there will be offer'd 320. then the Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er goes to the second Chamber, and tells them that the House has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready valued at 320. thereupon it may be some body offers 20. more. Then
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64416:135"/>
he goes to the third, and so to all; and it may be the House is rais'd to 400. pounds. Then he comes back to the first, and tells them, Gentlemen, the House is valued at 400. then it may be some body addes 20. more. The Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er goes back to all the Chambers, and if no body offer more, he goes to the seller, and tells him what is offer'd for his House; if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he does not like the price, he bids the Cryer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that if there be any body that will speak to the seller, he may come to him. And if he be very desirous to be rid of his House, then he sends a Duccatoon or two, with this condition, that he that will raise 50. pound in the price, shall have the money. The Cryer goes back and tells the company; then he that sayes first <hi>(to me)</hi> has the money. Then the Cryer goes back, and his Master gives him more money: for example, if the first were two Duccatoons for 50. pounds, the second money shall be two Duccatoons, and two Angels in gold, for him that shall bid 30. pound more. If that be taken, then he brings a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er summe still, till there be no body
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64416:136"/>
left that will take any more money; and all those that do take any are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to declare their names. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, it may be does not yet make up above 500. pound; then the Cryer tells them, Gentlemen, my Master would fain make 600. pound of his House. I will bate the other 100. pound by degrees; then he begins, 90. 80. 70. 60. 50. 40. 30. 20. 10. till there be some body that speaks; and then the House is sold for 500. pound, and so much odd money as hath been taken. If he bate all, and no body speak, then he that took the last mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is the buyer, and must give in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity the same night. If it happen that some body has drawn money, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hopes of being out-bid, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to keep the money, if unluckily for him no body does out-bid him, he must take the House; if he can give no security, he is carried to prison, and publickly whipt, to give example to the rest. The House thus sold, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity given, the buyer is to pay all the charges, which come to 10. pounds at least, so that they that have been there, are scot-free.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:64416:136"/>
The Gardens and Tombs are sold or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily after the same manner; the money to be laid down in three pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of every 40. Crowns, the City is to have one, which is a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue to it. Thus I have describ'd at length the way of selling, because it is almost the same thing in all the other Towns of <hi>Holland.</hi>

               <p>In the year 1635. and 36. it pleas'd God to visit <hi>Holland,</hi> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Leyden,</hi> with a great Plague, insomuch that the Church-yards could not hold the dead, but the Bastions were taken to bury them in.</p>
               <p>At the same time, or a little after, the Plague being somewhat over, War was proclaim'd between the two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> that made many people who before liv'd upon the Frontiers, come and seek refuge at <hi>Leyden;</hi> they fill'd up the empty Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Seven years after by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Magistrates, the Church-yards were levell'd, the dead bones transported else-where, and Trees planted, which now do begin to grow.</p>

There are many other particularities; as the Prison where the Count <hi>William</hi> was born. The Count <hi>Florent</hi> was also born at <hi>Leyden.</hi>

               <p>In the Chamber of the <hi>Bourgemasters,</hi> there is a Picture of <hi>Luke</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi>'s making, which was so valued by the Emperor <hi>Rodolf,</hi> that he offer'd to give as many pieces of gold for it, as would cover it. It represents the day of Judgement.</p>

                  <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> a Taylor, was in the first change of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, made King of the <hi>Anabaptists;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seized <hi>Munster,</hi> he made himself be treated as a King, wearing a Crown of gold; and when he did go abroad, had alwayes two Boyes before him, one of which carried a Sword, and the other the Bible. All that did not fall down and worship him were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately condemned to die, and executed. He kept 14. Wives, and caus'd one to be kill'd, because she despis'd his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations.

sudden deliverance. But at last the Town was taken, and the King with his accessaries taken and punish'd as they deserv'd. They keep yet at <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> the Table upon which this Taylor did use to sit and work. May all those that disobey their Magistrates come to as bad an end.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe Territory about <hi>Leyden</hi> is call'd <hi>Rhinlant,</hi> where is made the best Butter of all <hi>Holland.</hi> It is full of many fine Villages, which for the nobleness of their Buildings might be reckoned small Towns.</p>
               <p>I will begin with <hi>Rinsbourg,</hi> which was anciently a well fortified Town. About a league from it, <hi>Petronella,</hi> Sister to the Emperor <hi>Lotair,</hi> founded an Abbey for Nuns of quality; and by
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64416:138"/>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> many ancient Epitaphs; one I have seen of a Nun in the year 1218. It did depend for the spirituall on the Bishoprick of <hi>Utrect,</hi> and so did all <hi>Holland,</hi> there being in it never a Bishops See; but not for the temporall, as some have writ. The Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> and their Ladies did use to be buried here.</p>
               <p>A league further is <hi>Nortvic,</hi> within a mile of the Sea. Because of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness of the place many Gentlemen live in it. <hi>Valkenbourg</hi> next is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place for the Horse-Fair held there every moneth of <hi>September;</hi> I have been told, that before the War there did come to it Merchants from all parts of the world. It is a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant place, as well as <hi>Catvic,</hi> where live many rich men that live of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues. The <hi>Rhene</hi> did anciently enter the Sea here; and there was a square Castle built at the mouth of the River, but it is now buried under water. We find it written, that there were the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Magazines and Store-houses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>English.</hi> Of late when the

               <p>In Summer the Scholars and Citizens go to wash there, and eat fresh Fish; as also to breathe the salt Air of the Sea, which is held very wholesome. They that hire Horses may go all along the shore by the two <hi>Catvicks,</hi> and <hi>Walc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kembourg,</hi> and return by <hi>Nortvic, Rinsbourg,</hi> and <hi>Oestgeest. Wassenaer</hi> is situated just by the sandy Downs; it did formerly belong to the Prince <hi>de Lime,</hi> but now it belongs to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Family of the <hi>Wassenaers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warmout</hi> is a league and half from the Town on <hi>Harlem-</hi>side. By the way are two or three very fine Farms; and particularly one near the Channell: when you have pass'd the Bridge, you leave upon your right hand <hi>Lochorst,</hi> and then you come into the most delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Village in the world; the Lord of it is Mr. <hi>James Wassenaer,</hi> whose Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Admiral,</hi> and has eminently serv'd the publick in military and civil employments. The <hi>Arminians</hi> have a Church here; the Church is on the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64416:139"/>
out-side of the Village; as also the Lords House, which is a fair Castle, with a Moat round about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oestgeest</hi> is a Village in the Sands, which belongs to the Corporation of the City of <hi>Leyden.</hi> I my self have seen the Sand taken away three foot deep, carried to the Town and there sold; and an Acre of that ground which before was not worth 20. pound, made worth fourscore. <hi>Soutervoude</hi> is to the South, at a leagues distance from the Town; the way to it lies through <hi>Lam,</hi> leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on your left hand the Castle of <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestien,</hi> a fine House, and Gardens. This Village is little, but it is in a fine Soil, and has the best pasture grounds about <hi>Leyden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Magistrates have bought the Lordship of it; as also that of <hi>Leyder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorp,</hi> a Village that has more Palaces than Countrey peoples Houses. 'Tis here where we must admire the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of the Citizens; for one would think that there were an emulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, who should shew most marks of riches by their expences. It is built on both sides the <hi>Rhene,</hi> that
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64416:139"/>
goes through it; and behinde the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in the Meadows is a Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde which there was formerly a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasterie. Between <hi>Leyden</hi> and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie there was another Nunnerie, which was built upon a clayish ground, out of which Bricks are made now. In the year 1616. the Work-men found in digging two Meddals of gold, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the Emperor <hi>Nero</hi> to the life; I have seen them both. <hi>Woorschoten</hi> is another fine Village, belonging to <hi>Monsieur de Duvenvoord,</hi> whose Father was <hi>Keeper of the Great Seal.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts the Countrey is so delicious, that it is a kind of Paradise upon earth; as well because of the diversity of Fields, Meadows, and Woods, as of the prospect of so many stately Edifices, and neat Gardens.</p>
               <p>The Countrey people wear very good Cloathes, ordinarily of black, but without Cloaks. Their Wives have gold Rings on their fingers. It is not very rare to meet with Peasants here worth 10000. pound; they enjoy as great a liberty as any Citizen. Every Village has its <hi>Bailif, Secretary, Bourge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master,</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:64416:140"/>
and <hi>Judges;</hi> and besides a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sort of Countreymen that they call <hi>Welboremans,</hi> that is, men of a good Family, and well descended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alphen</hi> is half way to <hi>Woorde,</hi> and takes its name from a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight. There are very few Antiquities to be seen in <hi>Holland,</hi> because that all the Countrey has been chang'd and new peopled, and the Towns and Villages new built; so that there are no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of what it was, it is so encreased in riches and beauty. I come now to <hi>Caudekerk,</hi> where there is a fair Castle belonging to <hi>Monsi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur de Podgeest.</hi> All these Villages have their Fairs once a year, which anciently were never kept without some skirmish at Back-sword. The stoutest did use to hang up a Back-sword, and he that did come and touch it, was engaged in a combate, which was to be perform'd after this manner: First the parties break off the points of their Swords; then they take their Hats in their left hands to defend their faces, and nevertheless they often pare off a Cheek, or a Nose, or so. But these Duels are strictly forbidden,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64416:140"/>
and severely punish'd, if attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>This Countrey is so finely diversifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it wants nothing for a perfect prospect. For though Vines do not naturally grow in it, yet by the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the Inhabitants, there are many which produce Grapes enough for their eating. And as for Wine, they are sufficiently furnish'd by Sea.</p>
               <p>Now I come back to the Town, and observe, that it is the Garden of all the adjacent <hi>Province</hi> for Lettice, Parsley, Carrets, Pease, Beans, Parshley, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are transported to <hi>Zeeland</hi> and <hi>Utrect.</hi> At <hi>Amsterdam</hi> you shall hear them cry, <hi>Leyden</hi> Parsnips. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Gardiners industry is most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, for they have five or six crops in a year upon the same ground. I was desirous to know how much an Acre of ground might be worth to be sold; and it was answer'd, that Meadow was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout sevenscore pound an Acre; Corn grounds about 200. but Gardenage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 250. and sometimes 300. pound an Acre.</p>
               <p>Every day at six of the clock goes off
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64416:141"/>
the first Boat for <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and at twelve a clock the last; at eight and at eleven for <hi>Harlem;</hi> at twelve for <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trect.</hi> There are eight Barks for the <hi>Hague,</hi> and as many for <hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Citizens are govern'd with so much moderation by the Magistrates, that since the beginning of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth to this day, there has been no tumult nor rising by reason of Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Impositions, or the coming of Strangers, or for any other cause.</p>
               <p>But now let us come to that power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full City, from which <hi>Neptune</hi> seems to take his Orders; I mean <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THis Town which has not its like in the whole world, if we consider its Commerce, the conveniency of its Harbour, and the means it has of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out powerfull Fleets, takes its name from a Castle built upon <hi>Ye,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Lords of <hi>Amstel.</hi> It is seven leagues distant from <hi>Leyden,</hi> and you may go to it four different wayes; the most ordinary is that of the great Lake; the next by <hi>Harlem,</hi> and by the Channell made lately; the third in a Waggon, or on Horseback, by the <hi>Veenes;</hi> and the fourth by the night-Boat, that you meet at <hi>Leyderdorp.</hi> Since the late Wars, this Town is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased above two thirds; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall inquire into its Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>Many think that at first it was but a little Village for Fishermen, which has
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:64416:142"/>
encreas'd by little and little. In the year 1296. the Lord of <hi>Amstel</hi> was one of the Confederates of <hi>Gerrard de Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,</hi> who kill'd the Count <hi>Florent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1470. the Town was wall'd with a brick Wall, to resist the invasions of those of <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rect,</hi> who had often brought the Town into great danger. Not long after it was almost all consum'd by fire; then built again, and according as Trade encreas'd, it grew bigger still, and richer. The Emperor <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> in acknowledgement of the good services they had done him, and as a testimony of their industry and Trade, added an Imperial Crown over their Coat of Arms, which are <hi>three Crosses,</hi> almost like St. <hi>Andrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was formerly in it three Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries for men, and thirteen Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, which are all now employed to other uses.</p>
               <p>The Factions of the <hi>Houcs</hi> and the <hi>Cabelians</hi> have often afflicted this noble City, like those of the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>elphes</hi> and <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belins</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> But that which brought it nearest its ruine, was the attempt made by the <hi>Anabaptists.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:64416:142"/>
In the year 1525. that wicked King of <hi>Munster</hi> desiring to strengthen his party, by the addition of some conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable place, sent one of his Emissaries, nam'd <hi>Golen;</hi> who passing through <hi>Friezeland</hi> rais'd great tumults and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions there: which being quash'd, he fled to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and there lurking for a while, struck in at last with a man of his own principles, call'd <hi>Groet Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> and they two together resolv'd to make a party, and set upon the Town at some unexpected hour. They got together the chief of their Sect, and made a resolution to fall on at midnight by the sound of a Bell; but this wicked plot was discover'd just upon its execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with much ado hindred: for a young man of their side went and told the Magistrates, that the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> to the number of 600. were marching to seize the Town. While they were yet in deliberation, they heard the sound of Drums, and found that the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> had already gotten into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, and invaded the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house. In this confusion a Citizen had the fore-sight to carry away the Rope
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:64416:143"/>
of the Bell, which the seditious did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ring, as a signall to all theirs to unite, and a terrour to the sleepy Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, that did luckily contribute much to the saving of the City. For by this time, the Magistrates having sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and got many House-keepers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Arms, resolv'd to stop up all the Avenues to the Market-place with Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacks, and make a strong Barricado be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them. The morning come, gave the Townsmen leave to see the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the wickedness intended, and the inconsiderable number of the sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; who seeing themselves exposed to be pelted in that wide place, took san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in the Town-house, but thither they were pursued and cut in pieces, some few scaping by the favour of the night that came on. This conjuration thus quell'd, the Magistrates forbid the Citizens under great penalties, to lodg any Stranger that should be infected with such dangerous principles. Yet in the year 1515. there were more of these Fanaticks, both men and women, that running naked through the Streets with horrible cryes, had like to have
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64416:143"/>
surprized the Town-house, but they were suppress'd and punish'd. The <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> of this age do renounce them, for they do not hold it lawfull to fight at all.</p>
               <p>All this great Town is built upon <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotis,</hi> which are great Trees driven by main force into the ground, which is all moorish, to be as a foundation to build upon; and ordinarily it costs as much laying, as all the rest of the Fabrick does building up. The Town is like a Crescent, or half Moon, which ere it be long will fill up its round. In the Port there are so many Vessels, that we may say that he that has not seen <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> has not seen a Harbour: for in the Spring, from one end to the other of it, there is such a forrest of Masts, that Strangers are struck with wonder, and do believe, with reason, that all the Harbours of the world together cannot make so many Sayl.</p>
               <p>Every year in <hi>April</hi> there goes out a great Fleet for the <hi>Baltic</hi> Sea; I have heard many say, that in that Fleet in the time of War do go above 1500. Sayl of Ships: then reckon all those that go for
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64416:144"/>
                  <hi>France,</hi> and elsewhere, and all the Barks that are upon the Channels in the Town.</p>
               <p>The finest Streets are the <hi>Fosses,</hi> the <hi>Imperial,</hi> the <hi>Royal,</hi> the <hi>Cingel,</hi> the Street of <hi>Harlem,</hi> which is all newly built There are also three prodigious Sluces; and all the Bridges that were formerly of wood, are now of stone, with iron Vails and Balasters.</p>
               <p>The Town house which is now a building, the foundations of which have cost many hundred thousands of pounds, is to be a Master-piece, and a miracle beyond the seven that Antiquity bragg'd so much of.</p>
               <p>In the year 1595. the Monasterie of <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> was chang'd into a House of correction, call'd the <hi>Tucht Huyse,</hi> for those Children that will not be obedient to their Parents. At the coming in, there are two Lions upon the door, bridled, as an emblem to the wilde youth of the Town. They make them work; some sawe Brasil-wood, others do harder things, according to their faults and dispositions. If they refuse to work, they are put into a low Cellar,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64416:144"/>
and water is let in upon them; if they will stand still and be drown'd, they may; if they will pump and deliver themselves, then they are help'd out again.</p>
               <p>Some are put in for their life, others for a certain time. As lately there is a Law, that whosoever draws his Knife to strike another, shall either pay 10. pound fine, or work three moneths in the House of correction. Some are put in by their rich Parents, not to work, but only to put a stop to their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant expences, and they come out when they give testimonies of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and desire to mend.</p>
               <p>The same year there was a like House set up for young Maids, that should live in a licentious way. Every year in <hi>August</hi> it is free for all people to go in, and see the miserable condition of these offenders.</p>
               <p>The great Hospital has above 4000. pound a year; besides, it is thought that every year there are distributed many thousands of pounds to poor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>East-India</hi> Company has a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64416:145"/>
House, full of rich treasure; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the <hi>Bank-Generall,</hi> in which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes many millions. This Company is grown so powerfull, that they can set out a Fleet of men of War if need be; and in the <hi>Indies</hi> they make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of waging War with Kings, as lately with the King of <hi>Java,</hi> and yet drove on their Trade too.</p>
               <p>There are here many fair Churches; but I shall mention only that of St. <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> burn'd down in 1645. and is now built again better than before. Hard by the said Church are laid the foundations of a Tower, which is to be exceeding high; 6000, 300, and odd great Trees have been driven into a piece of ground of about a 100. foot square, to be <hi>Pilotis</hi> for the foundation of the Tower. In the Church the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters Pulpit is contriv'd with great art, with the four Evangelists, and a Tower above it. In the Glass-windows is the good Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
               <p>There are two great Suburbs or <hi>Fauxbonrgs,</hi> one upon the way to <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trect,</hi> and the other that goes to <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,</hi>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:64416:145"/>
a Village where the Boats that come from <hi>Leyden</hi> pass upon Rowlers. There is built a fair Pest-house.</p>
               <p>'Tis commonly said that this City is very like <hi>Venice;</hi> for my part I believe <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to be much superiour in riches: though the most serene State of <hi>Venice</hi> can bragg of having maintain'd a War for this twenty year, against the whole force of the <hi>Turks,</hi> without as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from any but the Pope. This Town is exceedingly well govern'd; every ones liberty preserv'd, and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty provided for all: and even in the night-time you may go any where, without fear of being robb'd or kill'd.</p>
               <p>The Air is not quite so good as at <hi>Leyden,</hi> by reason that it is environ'd with Marishes, which make it in accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but it is better seated for Trade, which is its life. Let us go to <hi>Harlem.</hi>

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64416:146"/>
Stars, and a Cross at the end of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> King of the <hi>Romans</hi> gave the Inhabitants many great priviledges. But if the victory carried in <hi>Palestina</hi> made them famous, the Art of Printing here invented has made them as remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable: though <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ts</hi> an Electorall Town does claim the same honour, but not so justly; for it was by a Prentice who upon <hi>Christmas-</hi>Eve run away from <hi>Harlem,</hi> with the Letters and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments serving to the Art of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, taking his time when all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were at Church. <hi>Laurent Coster</hi> was the name of the man that invented this Art.</p>
               <p>In the year 1292. the Faction of the <hi>Casembrots</hi> seized upon the Town, and plunder'd the Houses of most of the considerable Citizens; but it was crush'd by <hi>Albert</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Town condemn'd to a Fine of 27000. Crowns, and to the loss of its priviledges.</p>
               <p>In the year 1574. the <hi>Spaniards</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of <hi>Frederick,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> having taken <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phenen,</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:64416:147"/>
and cruelly cut the throats of all the Townsmen of <hi>Naerden,</hi> came and laid siege to <hi>Harlem:</hi> the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was 4000. strong, and refusing all conditions of a surrender, made brave sallyes upon them, hanging the <hi>Spanish</hi> prisoners upon the Walls; and in deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the tenth penny which the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> would levy, throwing over to them eleven Heads of their prisoners. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd, for they forced them to yeeld at discretion, though the very Women fought valiantly for their liberty.</p>
               <p>This Town is rather long than square, and is wash'd by the River <hi>Sparen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Market-place is the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, a stately Building; and over against it is the great Church, dedicated to St. <hi>Bavon:</hi> it is looked upon as the finest Church in all <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many Meadows about the Town; and on the Sea-side mountains of Sand; and there is a Wood towards <hi>Leyden,</hi> about half a mile from the Town, which is a great diversion to the Citizens, not only of <hi>Harlem,</hi> but of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64416:147"/>
                  <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> Towards the North there are Suburbs and great Gardens. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> is pretty populous, and holds a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall communication with <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Leyden</hi> by Boats, which go and come at all hours. In the year 1657. was made a Channell between <hi>Leyden</hi> and the said Town.</p>
               <p>The greatest Trade of <hi>Harlem</hi> is in Linnen; for there is the finest and whitest <hi>Holland.</hi> There are likewise many Weavers: I remember I was told that once all these Weavers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook their Trade, and turn'd Tulip-Merchants, at the time when the fancy for Tulips did reign over all the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> Besides, they do brew excellent Beer in this Town, which being transported into <hi>Frieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> grows better there than in <hi>Harlem</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>The Villages round about are <hi>Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stede, Sparenvow, Tetrode,</hi> &amp;c. There are also the Castles of <hi>Brederode, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> and <hi>Velsen;</hi> of which there remains little but the ruines. <hi>Monsieur Adrian Paw,</hi> Lord of <hi>Hemstede,</hi> &amp;c. has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd there a fair Library of Books, of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64416:148"/>
all Languages and Sciences, and such a one as will hardly be match'd by any private person. He is a very eminent man, employed as Plenipotentiary in the Treaty at <hi>Munster;</hi> though some do endeavour to cast aspersions upon him, as if he had had a hand in the troubles of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Between <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Leyden</hi> there are many fair Villages; amongst which <hi>Helegon, Lys,</hi> and <hi>Tassum,</hi> are three of the best, not above a league distant from one another. Not far from them is the House of <hi>Feiling,</hi> now belonging to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> and a noble Castle that <hi>Monsieur Dalmade</hi> has caus'd to be built of late. In coming from <hi>Harlem</hi> to <hi>Leyden,</hi> you have the Downs or sandy Hills on the right hand, and on the left the great Lake of <hi>Harlem</hi> which is alwayes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Boats, going and coming with Merchandizes.</p>

                  <p>Of <hi>Delft,</hi> and its Villages.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis Town is situated in a Plain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst pleasant Meadows, and was built by <hi>Godfrey the Crooked,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had conquer'd <hi>Holland</hi> by the assistance of the Bishop of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trect.</hi> I find nothing in our Annals concerning this place that is memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except that after a siege of six weeks, the Town was taken by <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> because they had receiv'd the Faction of the <hi>Hoves:</hi> the Town was dis-mantled, the Castle pull'd down, and the Inhabitants fin'd 10000. Crowns to the Duke.</p>
               <p>In the year 1536. in the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> the Town was burnt down by accident; and it was observ'd that a — not being able to save her young ones, because they were not fledged, flew her self into the flame, and died with them: but out of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:64416:149"/>
the ashes of this rose a much more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Town.</p>
               <p>1584. The Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> was traiterously kill'd by a <hi>Bourguignon,</hi> and there lies buried in a pompous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, in acknowledgement of the great actions he perform'd for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick liberty.</p>
               <p>There are two fair Churches, which have each a very high Steeple; and a Town-house at the end of the Market-place, with an Inscription in Latin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, to this purpose:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>This House hates, loves, punishes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, and honours,</l>
                  <l>Wickedness, Peace, Crimes, Laws, good men.</l>
                  <l>Haec Domus odit, amat, punit, conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat, honorat,</l>
                  <l>Nequitiam, Pacem, Crimina, Jura, bonos.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>They have here a great Trade of Beer, which they brew very well. The Town is not so big as <hi>Leyden,</hi> but it has a fairer Market-place; and though there be not so much Trade, nor the Houses so richly adorn'd on the inside, yet are there very rich Citizens.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64416:149"/>
The Countrey about lies lower than about <hi>Leyden;</hi> therefore in certain sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as when the Wind is North-East, if they should open their Sluces, all the Meadows about <hi>Delft</hi> would be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown. <hi>Delft</hi> is but four leagues from <hi>Leyden,</hi> and you have the convenience of a Waggon. Between these two Towns lies <hi>Lordsendam,</hi> a great and fair Village, which grows rich since the Channell of <hi>Leyden</hi> was made. There are two great Sluces to preserve the Countrey about <hi>Delft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voorburg</hi> is a little on one side the Channell, and is the ancientest Village in <hi>Holland.</hi> There are yet to be seen some foundations of a strong Castle built by the <hi>Romans,</hi> as it appears by the Inscriptions of the Stones that are every day taken from among the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines. It being so near the <hi>Hague,</hi> and upon the passage of so many people, seems rather a Town than a Village. It is but two leagues and a half from <hi>Leyden,</hi> and one league from the <hi>Hague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Losdun</hi> is a Village near the <hi>Hague,</hi> in which was a Nunnery for Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64416:150"/>
and Noblemens Daughters, and no others; founded by <hi>Margaret,</hi> Countess of <hi>Holland,</hi> whose Daughter <hi>Machtilde</hi> was brought abed of 365. Children at once, as many as there are dayes in the year; who were all bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by <hi>Otho,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Utrect:</hi> the name of <hi>John</hi> was given to the males, and that of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the females, who all died the same day with their Mother. The Story sayes that this Princess refus'd Alms to a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that had Twins in her Arms, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they were not of one mans getting; whereupon the poor Woman finding her self unjustly suspected, wish'd her as many at a time as there were dayes in the year. In memory of this History there is a Picture hung up in the Church, with an Inscription to this purpose; <hi>Here is a monstrous and memorable thing, which has not had its like since the beginning of the world: Reader, having perused this Story, go away and admire it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Near the <hi>Meuse</hi> there is a Castle with 365. Windows, which are the names of the said Children; and yet there are
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:64416:150"/>
many people that do not believe this Story at all. This Village has a sandy ground on one side of it, and on the other a fertile Corn-Countrey, call'd <hi>Vestland.</hi>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis Town is very ancient, and rich, by reason of the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of all sorts of Merchandizes that come down the <hi>Rhene.</hi> Its situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is incomparable; for it is environ'd with the Waters of the <hi>Rhene</hi> and <hi>Meuse,</hi> which make it a place of great Trade. It is call'd the <hi>Maiden Town,</hi> because it was never taken, though of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten besieged, and once particularly by the Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> in the year 1304. For he having conquer'd a great part of <hi>Holland,</hi> and committed all sorts of inhumanities upon that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sate down at last before <hi>Dort;</hi> but the Citizens unexpectedly sallying
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64416:151"/>
out upon him, routed his whole Army, and pursued him to <hi>Bosleduke;</hi> and in their way home, obtain'd a victory over the <hi>Flemmings</hi> at <hi>Isselmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1421. upon St. <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> day, the Banks broke near <hi>Dort,</hi> and about threescore and ten fair Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were swallowed up by this unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Element of Water; and above a 100000. men died miserably with their Wives and Children. It is said, that a wicked Countrey-Boor being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious of his Neighbours prosperity, made one night a Hole in the Bank, that he might drown him and all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in their Beds, with a design of stopping it again: but the Tide coming in with a strong Winde, broke quite through; first drown'd this perfidious Rogue, and then overwhelm'd all that stood in its way. Since the Water ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by little and little been driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the industry of the infatigable Inhabitants, they have drain'd most part of that which lay under Water, and discover'd some Villages. There is hopes of getting all, during this peace; but it can only be done in the great heat of Summer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:64416:151"/>
As it happens often, that when we are ignorant of the cause of a thing, we are apt to attribute it to some invisible supernaturall power, or to our sins, that provoke Gods anger; so some have said, that these Villages were drown'd, because they did make ill use of their great riches; that they would not wear any other than golden Spurrs, and liv'd in a great magnificence.</p>
               <p>But let us return to the Town, which by an unlucky accident of Fire had like to have been quite destroyed; there were burn'd above 2000. Houses, with the Town-house, and Cathedral-Church.</p>
               <p>1618. the <hi>National Syn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

There were present many learned men both from <hi>France</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts; amongst others, the most Reverend Father in God the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who since was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in the troubles in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dort</hi> was the place where was born
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64416:152"/>
that factious Preacher, Brother <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Adrian,</hi> of whom the people to this day tell so many pleasant Stories. For my part, I have heard worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons say, that he was really a very elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent person, who did ravish his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with admiration; but that he did handle some points, that were a little too free in those dayes; but he fear'd no body. He died at <hi>Bruges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to be observ'd, that when the Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> were to be inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is, acknowledged for lawfull Princes, they did first come into <hi>Dort,</hi> and there did swear to the <hi>States</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve all their liberties and priviledges, from whom consequently they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Oath of Allegiance. In the Assembly of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Dort-Deputies</hi> have the first place, and speak first.</p>
               <p>Before the Town are taken great quantities of all sorts of Fish, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of Salmon; for in one year there were sold in the said Town 892. Salmons: and it is commonly said, that Servants put it in their bargain, that they shall not eat Salmon above twice a Week.</p>

Upon the same River, a league off, is <hi>Schiedam,</hi> a famous Town for Fishing. <hi>Vlarding</hi> is hard by, a small Village, but formerly a strong Town; the <hi>Meuse</hi> being a little too near it, has devoured a great part of it. <hi>Masanluys</hi> is a fair Burrough, two leagues lower; the Inhabitants whereof are most Fishermen. They that take shipping at the <hi>Bril,</hi> go through this Burrough.</p>
               <p>Having cross'd the <hi>Meuse,</hi> which is above a league broad in this place, you come to the <hi>Briel,</hi> which is at the mouth of the River, and all Ships that come from <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> pass before it. This Town was taken by onset by the Count of <hi>Lumay,</hi> in 1572. and it was the first place that the Water-<hi>Gueux</hi> took from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and here were laid the first foundations of that Commonwealth, which now flourishes in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> The Town is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64416:155"/>
and the Territory fruitfull in Wheat; but the Air is thick, and thence proceeds the extream rudeness of its Inhabitants, a vice common to all Sea-Towns.</p>
               <p>But let us cross the <hi>Meuse</hi> again to go to the <hi>Hague;</hi> and in our way see St. <hi>Grave-sant,</hi> a place where formerly the Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> did use to keep their Court.

               <p>The Market-place is before the great Church, which has a very high square Steeple, and may be seen a great way off. There is another fine Street, though not finish'd, call'd <hi>Le fosse du Prince;</hi> here live many Strangers, some for business, and others for their advantage.

                     <hi>Of</hi> Voerden.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis Town was built in 1374. by the Bishop of <hi>Utrect,</hi> to keep the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Utrect</hi> in awe. It has been the occasion of great Wars between these two <hi>Provinces;</hi> but at last by the conspiracy of <hi>Heman de Voerden</hi> with <hi>de Velsen,</hi> it was reduced under the <hi>Hollanders</hi> obedience. The <hi>Rhene</hi> goes through it, and in its Fauxbourgs are made great quantities of Bricks. There is a Castle formerly held impregnable, in which the Admiral of <hi>Arragon</hi> was kept prisoner a great while, after the Battle of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From <hi>Voerden</hi> we will turn our backs to <hi>Utrect,</hi> and our side to <hi>Montfort,</hi> and come to <hi>Undevater,</hi> and so follow the borders of the <hi>Province.</hi> This Town is upon <hi>Issel,</hi> within a league of <hi>Montfort;</hi> it is but little, but very pleasant. In 1579. it was taken and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64416:158"/>
sackt by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to revenge the affront they had receiv'd before <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and in payment of their arrears. From this place you may go to <hi>Goude,</hi> and by the <hi>Meuse</hi> to <hi>Rotterdam.</hi> All along the said River are nothing but fair Villages, and pleasant Countrey-Houses.</p>
               <p>Now let us cross the River <hi>Lec,</hi> and see the Towns lying upon it. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly one of the Branches of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> upon which are situated <hi>Aulembourg,</hi> and <hi>Viane,</hi> a small Town which belongs to the <hi>Brederodes,</hi> and is not reckon'd among the Towns of <hi>Holland.</hi> In it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is cheap, for there is little or no Excise payed, and all those that do break in <hi>Holland,</hi> may sowe themselves here, and have a protection from the Lord of the place.</p>
               <p>There is in it a fair Castle, in which ordinarily <hi>Monsieur Brederode</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
               <p>Four leagues lower is <hi>Schoon-hoven,</hi> which takes its name from the beauty of its Gardens; for <hi>Schoon</hi> signifies fair, and <hi>Hoff</hi> Garden, or Court. Some by reason of its Harbour have call'd it <hi>Schoon-haff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:64416:158"/>
The River is here very broad, and there are many Salmon and other deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Fish taken in it. The Town is small, but very pleasant, and there are fine Walks about it.</p>
               <p>An Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> caus'd a Bank to be raised from <hi>Ameron</hi> to the said Town, in favour of the Bishop <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1424. the said Town was deliver'd to <hi>Jaequeline,</hi> Countess of <hi>Holland,</hi> by the treachery of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; but the Castle held out, though there were but a Garrison of 50. stout men in it: at last they yeelded, and had all quarter and their liberties, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one <hi>Albert Beiling,</hi> whose vertue and loyalty is as much to be prized, as that of the <hi>Roman Regulus;</hi> for having obtain'd leave to go home and settle his Estate, and having given no other security than his Parole, he fail'd not upon the day appointed to come and render himself prisoner.</p>

                  <hi>Asperen,</hi> a small Town upon the same River, which was anciently a Fee of the noble House of <hi>Arkel,</hi> as well as <hi>Heu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelom.</hi> There was a very ancient Castle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leerdam</hi> is in the middle of these two little Towns, and belonging to the same Family: it is almost square, and there are many Gardens. <hi>Frederick,</hi> Count <hi>Egmond,</hi> having married <hi>Mary,</hi> Daughter to the Lord of <hi>Arkel,</hi> was the first Earl of <hi>Leerdam.</hi> It belongs now to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> for the Prince <hi>Philip,</hi> great Uncle to this Prince, had it from his Mother, <hi>Anna</hi> of <hi>Egmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gorcum</hi> is now one of the strongest places of the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly fortified according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern way. It is upon the <hi>Meuse,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five leagues above <hi>Dort.</hi> It was first built by a Gentleman of the House of <hi>Arkel,</hi> who had a fair Castle here. The River <hi>Lingue</hi> runs through it, and brings in all Commodities to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. This Town is one of the Keys of <hi>Holland,</hi> together with the strong Castle of <hi>Louvestein,</hi> situated a little
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:64416:159"/>
higher, upon the confluence of the two Rivers. It is famous for having been the prison of many <hi>Arminian</hi> Ministers; and amongst others of that learn'd <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Grotius,</hi> who was since Embassador from the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to the King of <hi>France.</hi> He got out by a very witty stratagem, fled into <hi>Brabant,</hi> and from thence pass'd into <hi>France.</hi> He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd at last to reconcile all mindes about Religion; but the Politicians on one side, and the Churchmen on the other, frustrated his good intentions. He died at <hi>Rostoc</hi> in <hi>Ruckelbnrg,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home, and his body lies buried at <hi>Delft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To go to <hi>Heusden</hi> you must go out of the limits, and pass by <hi>Bommel,</hi> though it be not altogether necessary, for there is another way. <hi>Bommel</hi> is an Island which defends <hi>Holland,</hi> and is about two leagues from <hi>Bosleduke,</hi> most admirably fortified.</p>
               <p>But let us come to <hi>Heusden,</hi> which is below <hi>Bosleduke,</hi> upon the <hi>Meuse,</hi> and let us consider it, not for the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, that is, whether it be of the Dutchy of <hi>Brabant,</hi> or of <hi>Holland;</hi> but
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64416:160"/>
for its admirable Fortifications. It is environ'd with seven or eight Bastions, and some half Moons. This with the breadth of the River secures it from all danger, and <hi>Holland</hi> from all fear on that side.</p>
               <p>There is likewise a Fort in the Island of <hi>Hemert,</hi> upon the <hi>Vahal,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends <hi>Heusden;</hi> a thing to be seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you go down the River, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the borders of <hi>Brabant,</hi> upon which lies <hi>Voroum,</hi> a small Town, with four Bastions between <hi>Louvestein</hi> and <hi>Gorcum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This little place, with the Lordship of <hi>Altena,</hi> was sold to the <hi>States</hi> for 10000. pound, and is now a Rampart to the whole <hi>Province.</hi> All the Towns fronting upon <hi>Gueldres</hi> are very well fortified, and in a better Air than the Towns of <hi>Holland,</hi> as having better Waters; but they are much inferior in beauty, neatness, and riches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iselstein</hi> is a small Town situated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Yssel,</hi> which they of <hi>Utrect</hi> have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten laid claim to, and there has been War between the Bishops of <hi>Utrect</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> for it; the place
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64416:160"/>
standing in a fruitfull pleasant Soyl. It is rather long than square, and adorn'd with fine Gardens; the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> is Lord of it. Now let us fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Frontier of <hi>Brabant,</hi> to the West.</p>
               <p>As soon as you come out of the Lordship of <hi>Altena,</hi> you meet with the strong Town of <hi>Gertrudenbergue,</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from <hi>Holland</hi> by a great Lake that the <hi>Rhene</hi> and the <hi>Meuse</hi> make before <hi>Dort.</hi> It is almost a half Moon, of which two thirds are bath'd with the Water of the Lake, and has excellent Bastions. Besides, there are Forts with Sluces, which can drown the rest of the ground which lies low.</p>
               <p>In the year 1321. the Castle was built; and a 100. year after both the Town and the Cathedrall Church were both burnt down by those of <hi>Dort,</hi> who took it after a long siege. It belongs now to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> having often chang'd Masters by the chance of War. There is taken before it great quantities of Salmon; but I have heard a Citizen relate, that in the time of the War their Fishing fail'd, because of the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:64416:161"/>
great noise of the Canonadoes, that frighted all the Fish away.</p>
               <p>To go from <hi>Gertrudenbergue</hi> by land to <hi>Clundert,</hi> you must leave <hi>Breda</hi> on the left hand, and pass by <hi>Sevenberg,</hi> a Lordship which depends on <hi>Brabant. Clundert</hi> has eight Bastions, and some Ravelins, and was first wall'd by Prince <hi>William</hi> the first, whose it was, and since fortified. It has a fine Church, and good Bells.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Willemstradt</hi> is hard by, a Town which bears the name of its founder. It has seven Bastions, a double Ditch, and a fair Harbour. It has <hi>Brabant</hi> on the South, and <hi>Zeeland</hi> on the North, which seems to communicate to it something of the courseness of its Air; for here are bred Feavers, very hard to be cur'd, insomuch as those that have them seem as if they were bewitched. The Citizens of <hi>Leyden</hi> can testifie it to their cost; for many of them were in Garrison there in the War time, and when they came home, some died, some lingred a great while, and in all, I know not above three that scap'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very sick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:64416:161"/>
I have spoke of these little Towns, only for their Fortifications; let us now see the Islands that are over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Zeeland.</hi> The first is <hi>Overslac;</hi> you must land at <hi>Ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In the year 1355. the second Town
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64416:162"/>
was built, and adorn'd with priviledges by the Duke <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1481. they of <hi>Utrect</hi> having given the <hi>Hollanders</hi> a great overthrow, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the Town of <hi>Naerden</hi> by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious stratagem; for they dress'd a good number of young Souldiers like Countreywomen going to Market, who being let in, seized a Gate of the Town, and gave entrance to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: the Citizens redeem'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from fire and sword by a great summe of money. But a little after they were reveng'd; for falling upon the Bishoprick, they kill'd 1500. of their enemies upon the spot, and in memory of that advantage, built a high Tower, with this Inscription, <hi>Utrect hold thy peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In 1486. the said Town was almost all burnt down; and this misfortune seem'd to be a fore-runner of that which befell them about a 100. years after: for <hi>Frederick,</hi> Son to the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> having taken <hi>Zutpheen,</hi> fell upon <hi>Naerden.</hi> The Citizens not expecting so sudden an alarm, were not so provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to send Embassadors to mediate
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64416:163"/>
for them; but seeing the Army at their Gates, surrender'd their Town into the victors hands, and trusted to his discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mercy: but he participating much of the cruell humor of his Father, commanded all the Inhabitants to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in the publick Market-place, and there sent them Monks to confess them, and pronounce to them their sentence of death. The poor creatures who thought to have heard their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don proclaim'd, were immediately set upon by some Regiments, and cruelly slaughter'd. This barbarous execution brought so great an odium upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that it made the people of <hi>Leyden</hi> rather resolve to starve, than yeeld to the mercy of so cruell a Nation. That which is most remarkable too, is, that they were most of them Catholicks; and I think it is from thence that comes that deriding Proverb in <hi>Holland, Art thou a Catholick, that is good for thy soul.</hi>

                  <hi>Mude</hi> is hard by <hi>Naerden,</hi> upon the River <hi>Veckt,</hi> and at the mouth of the South-Sea. It is a little Town, which has a very ancient Castle, in which was

               <p>All the Countrey from <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> taking by <hi>Voerden</hi> to <hi>Leyden,</hi> shut in by the Sea of <hi>Harlem,</hi> is very low; it is all Meadow, or Turf-ground; as also between <hi>Leyden, Goude,</hi> and <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> there are digg'd great quantities of Turfs: nay the Earth is so cut in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, that it is inaccessible other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by Boat, which is a Subject of great admiration to Strangers.</p>
               <p>The Boats that go in the night-time from <hi>Leyderdorp</hi> to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> pass through the Lake of <hi>Brassmermeere,</hi> and stay about two hours at a Village call'd <hi>Bilderdam;</hi> then in the morning they arrive at another call'd <hi>Ouderkerk,</hi> which is a league from <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> There are Waggons that go by land; and it is particularly the Earth of this Countrey that is observ'd to tremble and quake. When it has rain'd, the wayes are all drown'd, and become like a Marsh.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Lakes and Rivers.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OF all the Rivers that come from <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Water-Holland,</hi> the chiefest is the <hi>Rhene,</hi> which divides into two branches; one retains the name of <hi>Rhene,</hi> and the other is call'd <hi>Vahal,</hi> and that receives the <hi>Meuse,</hi> which comes from <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and goes through the Town of <hi>Leege.</hi> These Rivers meet all before <hi>Gorcum,</hi> and flow gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly into the Sea, near <hi>Dort</hi> and <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> making all the Islands we have spoke of. The Countrey lying low, there are abundance of Lakes, into which enter a great many Channels, made by Art. The greatest of these Lakes is <hi>Harlem-Lake,</hi> which begins to extend it self between <hi>Leyden</hi> and the Village of <hi>Kague,</hi> which stand in at Island at the mouth of the said Lake, into which the Boats enter here. Those Boats that go to <hi>Harlem,</hi> keep
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64416:164"/>
on the left hand, and they that go to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> on the right, and pass by <hi>Alsemeer.</hi> This Lake is very broad, but not deep; between <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> it grows narrower, and is call'd <hi>Sprin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>its, to let out some of the Water into the River <hi>Ye.</hi> Here the <hi>Harlem</hi> Boats stay, and the Passengers land, and see a fair House, built by the noble Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Heemrades.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>Amsterdam-</hi>side it grows still nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, till you come to <hi>Overtom,</hi> a fair Village of the Jurisdiction of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which keeps the passage shut by a Dike, over which the Boats which go from <hi>Leyden</hi> to <hi>Amsterdam</hi> must pass, by the means of certain wooden Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and other Instruments. This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle is to force the great Boats full of Merchandizes, to go by <hi>Harlem,</hi> to the profit of the said Town.</p>
               <p>This Lake before the Wars was not half so big; and I have heard old men say, that from their remembrance it had encreased the compass of above
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64416:165"/>
four miles. Every year it eats away some of the Land that borders upon it, insomuch that the neighbouring Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations have often met to consult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the drayning of it, but as yet without effect. It would require a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 500. miles, and the cost would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to above 200000. pound; but the bottome being partly <hi>Veenes,</hi> and partly good Land, would sell well, and defray a good part of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</p>
               <p>This Lake is very full of Fish, and breeds Eeles of a prodigious bigness, as all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>imy Waters do. But I shall not speak any more of this nor other Lakes, nor of the holes which the Countrey people make every day by digging up Turfs, which if at last by some rupture they should meet, would go near to drown all this lower Region, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up these fine Meadows. Now let us go to <hi>North-Holland.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>North-Holland, <hi>commonly call'd</hi> West-Frieze.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis part is so call'd, because it has <hi>Holland</hi> on the South, and <hi>Friezeland</hi> on the East, from which it is divided by the South-Sea, which some Authors affirm to have been formerly so narrow, that it might have been pass'd over with a plank. This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is likewise call'd <hi>Waterland,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the many Lakes that it abounds with; some of them have been drayn'd, <hi>viz. Beemster, Ziip,</hi> and <hi>Schermer,</hi> which are now rich grounds, where the chief Citizens of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> have Houses and Gardens. Every where here there are Dikes; that of <hi>Mede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliike</hi> is made of a certain matter which the Sea casts up, this Element prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thus a bridle to its own fury.</p>
               <p>This Countrey has on the North the Ocean and the <hi>Texel,</hi> and on the South
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64416:166"/>
the River <hi>Ye,</hi> and is joyn'd to the South-part of <hi>Holland,</hi> by a small neck of Land on <hi>Harlem-</hi>side.</p>
               <p>This people drives a great Trade, by means of the Water they are environ'd with, which at the same time does so fortifie them, as to secure them from all acts of hostility. They keep their old fashions and customes; and yet they are not so simple as they appear, but are indeed very sincere, and more to be believ'd upon their simple affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, than other Nations upon their oaths and blasphemies. The Women are equally chaste and fair, and often a young man shall sit a whole night by his Mistress, and never hold any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course any wayes offensive to her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. They have most of them red Hair, and their locks guilded upon their fore-heads. They wear not Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, but a velvet Whisk, with a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Hook and Clasp. That which I think very undecent, is, that they wear their Petticoats so short, that they scarce come below their knees. The men wear plain Bands, square Beards, have a grave behaviour, and are of a
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64416:166"/>
strong complexion, and tall stature. All their business is Commerce, which they have with all the Northern Countries; and particularly Herrings are their great Commodity.</p>
               <p>Between <hi>Harlem</hi> and <hi>Alcmaer</hi> there is a pleasant Village, whither anciently people did use to go in pilgrimage. It is situated upon the Sea of <hi>Wiie;</hi> the bank that begins there is call'd St. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaths</hi> bank; and the other which goes to <hi>Sardam</hi> is call'd <hi>Assendelftdike.</hi> At <hi>Sardam</hi> are continually built great Ships for the <hi>Indies.</hi> But let us take our way to <hi>Alcmaer.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ALcmaer</hi> is not only one of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Towns of <hi>Holland,</hi> but also of all the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness of its Buildings, and the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of its Streets. The Wars that it maintain'd against the <hi>Friezelanders,</hi> bear witness of its antiquity.</p>
               <p>It is very rich, and has a great Trade. Many of its Inhabitants live pleasantly, having very fine Gardens, and a fine Countrey.</p>
               <p>In 1328. it was burnt; the <hi>Frieze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> have often besieged it: and in the year 1517. it was taken and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd for eight dayes by those of <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl <hi>Florent</hi> the fifth made a Dike to the very extremities of the Countrey, to hinder the <hi>Friezelanders</hi> incursions. There are fair marks to shoot at, for the exercise and diversion of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64416:167"/>
and next to <hi>Leyden,</hi> it has the reputation of being the cleanliest Town in <hi>Holland.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> after the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Harlem</hi> laid siege to it, but in wain; they were forced to quit the Town, partly by reason of the ill Airs and partly because of the stout resist, ance made by the Townsmen. Thi Town is near the <hi>Schermer,</hi> the greatest Lake of this Septentrionall part.</p>
               <p>At some leagues from <hi>Alcmaer</hi> upon the North-Sea-side, is the <hi>Hontbos,</hi> where there are monstrous Dikes, made in a most singular manner, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the fury of the Ocean, which here does most desperately threaten the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of all <hi>Holland.</hi> Therefore there is a double bank, that so in case one should break, the other might give the people time to repair the first. From thence you may go to the <hi>Texel,</hi> or take your way to <hi>Seay n</hi> by the <hi>Ziipe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seayen</hi> is a great Village, situated in a fat Countrey, where Land is as dear again as in any part of <hi>Holland.</hi> There has been Trees, the Fruits of which have been sold for 10. pound in one
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:64416:168"/>
year. It has a very large Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place. The Lords of <hi>Seayen</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from the House of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> It is the mid-way between <hi>Alcmaer</hi> and <hi>Medenbliick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Medenbliick</hi> is an ancient Town; all Authors agree that it was formerly the Metropolis, before <hi>Horne</hi> and <hi>Enchusen</hi> were built. Some derive its name from the River <hi>Medem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lbold</hi> did live here.</p>
               <p>It was taken by the <hi>Kenemars</hi> in the year 1426. and in 1514. they of <hi>Guel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres</hi> burnt it down to the ground. It has high and strong Dikes to keep out the South-Sea, for the Land lies a great deal lower than the Water. When there is a great storm, and that the Sea beats with that violence, that it does threaten the utter ruine of all that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it, the Inhabitants clap Sails all along between the Dike and the Water, and so hinder it from piercing into the body of the bank: a pretty invention, and to which they owe the safety of their whole Countrey. There is an old
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64416:168"/>
Castle which some suspect to have been the Palace of the Princes of <hi>Friezeland.</hi> Here live most of your Wood-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that drive a great Trade to <hi>Norway,</hi> and in the North. Let us follow the Sea-side, and come to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chusen.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THis Town is environ'd on three parts by the Sea.

Boats, to transport his Army into <hi>Friezeland;</hi> an argument that then it was a famous Port. 'Tis true, that as time changes all things, so has it done this Harbour; for now the Sands that are got into the mouth of it, do much hinder the entrance of great Ships; yet are there often built here
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64416:169"/>
great Ships for the <hi>Indies,</hi> and great Fleets do sayl from hence to the <hi>Baltic</hi> Seas.</p>
               <p>It was not yet wall'd when it was burnt by <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Arkel,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Putene</hi> in 1279. In 1426. it was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by the <hi>Kenemars;</hi> and the same year, some Souldiers of the Countess <hi>Jacqueline,</hi> coming in upon a sudden, surprized about a 100. of the principall Citizens at dinner, and cut off all their Heads; a barbarous action, which does come near the cruelty of our Age.</p>
               <p>In 1514. a part of the Rampart, and many Houses, were destroyed by an Inundation.</p>
               <p>1537. the <hi>Gueldreses</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd War to <hi>Holland,</hi> had like to have surpriz'd the said Town; but the Water being low, they fail'd of their design.</p>
               <p>This was the first Town that revolted from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>North-Holland.</hi> In the year 1591. the Town was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and it now drives a great Trade in Her<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64416:169"/>
upon the Sea; which is the reason why it has no good Water to drink, the Countrey lying so low. By the complaints of its Inhabitants we perceive that it decayes in Trade, and has formerly had a greater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which appears by many empty Houses.</p>
               <p>There is a very good Alms-house; and the Steeple is considerable for its height, being built in so moorish a soft ground.

               <p>THis Town is the second of <hi>North-Holland.</hi> It is built upon the South-Sea, and has the best Harbour of all that Coast. There was in this Town a famous Faction of the <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars;</hi> but they were routed by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens after a long combate.

               <p>In 1557. the Dikes being broke, so much Water got into the Town, as had like to have drowned it; but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of the Inhabitants, the banks were soon repaired again.</p>
               <p>There is but a little arm of the Sea to be pass'd to come to <hi>Edam,</hi> two leagues from <hi>Horne.</hi> It is a small Town, built triangular-wise upon the River of <hi>Ye,</hi>

in the fattest part of <hi>Holland.</hi> Here is made the best <hi>Holland</hi> Cheese with red Rinde, so much sought after by all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and indeed it yeelds not to the <hi>Parmesan.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>I Will not here undertake to dispute, which is the best of all those Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are here tolerated, knowing that it is too ticklish a matter to be handled, without giving offence to some body. I shall only relate barely, how many sorts of Religions there are within the limits of the <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They being at their first revolt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to <hi>Spain</hi> in all things: resolv'd to give as much liberty as that King would deny, and to tolerate all Religions, because he would suffer but one. In order to this, the State thriving in their Wars, took upon them to drive out the Priests, Monks, and Nuns, as so many Emissaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> and stiff maintainers of one only Religion. The chief Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del and Reformation was made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:64416:174"/>
to the Churches of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and the <hi>high Palatinate;</hi> and to this day they that pretend to any Charge or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, must be of this Religion, if they desire to be admitted.</p>
               <p>They that follow the Doctrine of <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> have all freedome in <hi>Holland,</hi> and liberty to build Churches among the Houses, to distinguish them from the other Reform'd. The <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists</hi> have likewise theirs, and are divided into divers Sects. They that have the great Assembly are call'd <hi>Drec Wagens.</hi> And I will say this to their praise, that in their Meetings they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Scripture, without making any invectives, or railing upon any body else.</p>
               <p>In the beginning those of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd Religion in <hi>Holland,</hi> were call'd <hi>Geux,</hi> or Beggars; as in <hi>France, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots,</hi> a name which the vulgar yet retain with joy, bragging, that they were neither <hi>Papists</hi> nor <hi>Martinists,</hi> but <hi>Geux.</hi> This was the occasion of their being thus nam'd: In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the troubles, 500. Gentlemen being come to <hi>Brussels,</hi> to present a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:64416:175"/>
to the Princess of <hi>Parma,</hi> then Governant, came of a sudden into her Palace; she being at the Window, talking with the Earl of <hi>Varlemont,</hi> was frighted with so sudden and so great an appearance, and asked him if he knew what it mean'd; who answered, <hi>Madam, Do not trouble your self, they are but Beggars; Ce ne sout que des Geux.</hi> This being told these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at Supper, they all agreed to dress themselves in Beggars Cloaks, and take wooden Dishes in their Hands, with this Motto, <hi>We are all the Kings faithfull Servants, even to Beggary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must not forget the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who have made a Schisme among the Reform'd about Predestination. The <hi>Gomarists</hi> or Counter-Remonstrants opposed the said Articles of Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they were thus nam'd from their two Heads, who were both professors of Divinity in <hi>Leyden, Arminius</hi> and <hi>Gomarius.</hi> Their Division had such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence among the people, that the Towns did already beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:64416:175"/>
of the <hi>States</hi> applied a remedy to these Disorders. <hi>Barnevelt</hi> was taken and beheaded, some Magistrates of Towns deposed, and many Ministers of the <hi>Arminians</hi> imprisoned, their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being condemn'd by the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Arminians</hi> have never been at quiet, till they have obtain'd a free exercise through most Towns of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as <hi>Amsterdam, Rotterdam,</hi> and the <hi>Hague</hi> it self, but not at <hi>Harlem,</hi> nor <hi>Leyden;</hi> in the last of which places, they have often met in the open Streets, sung their Psalms, and preached, but have still been disturbed by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. At last seeing they could not gain a Church in the Town, they have been glad to obtain leave to meet at <hi>Warmont,</hi> a Village hard by it, which the Lord of the place has willingly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the benefit that arises to his Village by it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> are publickly tolerated, and have their Synagogues in <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Catholicks</hi> are the only excluded from this liberty, though they be in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:64416:176"/>
great numbers, and most of them natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whose Ancestors have contributed both their bloods and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to the driving out of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> but all that is forgotten, and they enjoy nothing but a liberty of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in which they rest quietly. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Politicians of our Age have thought, that the reason why they are thus kept under, was, because the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the profess'd enemy of the <hi>States,</hi> was of their Religion; and that if peace were once concluded, there would be more indulgence shewed. But I think our Politicians mistaken in their conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and do rather look upon the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> as people that have imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Romans;</hi> who having once dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> and tasted the sweetness of liberty, did not spare <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latin</hi> himself, who had been one of the great opposers of tyranny, not because there was cause, but because he was of the Royall Race. So I do not dispute, whether the <hi>Papists</hi> have given Subject to distrust them; but I say, they have given occasion to fear them, because they are of our enemies Religion. 'Tis
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:64416:176"/>
true, that in some Towns, where the memory of the actions perform'd by the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> in order to the publick li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, is yet preserv'd, they have the freedome of meeting in private Houses. The Countrey people do persevere very constantly in the said Religion, and are not so constrained as in the Towns, though they are derided by all Sects whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Their Ceremonies in Burying are the same all over <hi>Holland;</hi> and since '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is a Religious Worship, we shall here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the form of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> suffer not their Dead to be buried any where, but in Churches and Church-yards. The Reform'd are not so scrupulous, and say, that one Earth is not holier than another, neither do they use much Ceremony.</p>
               <p>As soon as the person is dead, the Neighbours sewe the Body up in a Winding-sheet, and they are treated with a Collation, and a Cup of Sack; then they make a Note of the names of those they intend to invite. The day appointed being come, they meet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:64416:177"/>
Two of the Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, in the House of the deceased; there their names are call'd over, and they go out two by two, the Kindred next the Body, and the Friends after them, every one according to his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Body being buried, they come back to the House, where he that goes first invites the company in; then they are presented with Wine, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one drinks as much as he pleases, and goes away when he thinks fit. The richer sort are buried in the Church, and the company has Rhenish Wine given them. The poor give Beer.</p>
               <p>The young Men and Maids are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by young people. The Body is all cover'd with Flowers, and the Bearers have a branch of Laurell or Rosemary in their Hand. If it be a person of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, all the Bearers are presented with a summe of Money, which they go and spend in a treating-House. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a certain summe to be given to the purse of the Neighbourhood. And such as have not a burying place in the Church, must pay very dear for it, if
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:64416:177"/>
they intend to have one. They for whom the biggest Bell rings, pay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0. shillings at least. The <hi>Papists</hi> are very observant of that Ceremony; but the Reform'd laugh at it, as a piece of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, and instituted for the Churches profit. However these Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryings without Prayers or Ceremony, cost as much as the Obsequies of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> After the bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Professor, there is a Speech made in honour of him. If the Body be not in the Church at half an hour past two, there is a Fine of 20. shillings to be payed; if it be not there till after three, then there is the double due.</p>
               <p>Some are so ill-bred, as to drink themselves drunk at these Buryings; and when they go home in their long Cloaks, you shall finde them in the mire; but the people of quality come not to that extremity, but after two or three Glasses of Wine, return qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly.</p>
               <p>Besides all these Religions, there is a certain Assembly held at <hi>Rinsbourg,</hi> ten or twelve times a year, where every
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:64416:178"/>
one that will has the liberty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Exhortation; it is call'd the <hi>Assembly of the free-minded.</hi> There are many others that sit at home reading the Scripture, and never come to any Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be out of curiosity. The <hi>Arianisme</hi> has those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it. In a word, any body may follow his own opinion, but not profess it with a publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. There are <hi>Atheists</hi> enough too.</p>

               <p>There are also many Gentlemen in
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:64416:179"/>
the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> that bear a Lion in their Coat. But since my design is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to speak of <hi>Holland,</hi> I shall mention no other than the Nobility of that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,</hi> as well to publish their antiquity, as to stop the mouthes of some Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who either by an absurd igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or maliciously, do publish that there are no Gentlemen in <hi>Holland.</hi> 'Tis true, that the length of the Civill Wars has been the death of many of that couragious Nobility, who seeking Honour have died in the bed of it, and so some Families of ancient extract are quite extinguish'd. But there are yet many remaining, who may contend for antiquity and splendor with most Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <p>'Tis commonly said, that the <hi>Italian</hi> Nobility do not scruple to trade.

               <p>But the <hi>Germans</hi> do not only abhor Traffick, but think it a greater baseness,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:64416:179"/>
to mingle their blood with one meanly born.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> seem to be in the middle between these extreams.</p>
               <p>For first, The <hi>Dutch</hi> Nobility does not trade. They love War, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Countrey; are not Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellists, nor quarrelsome, like the <hi>French;</hi> love Learning, particularly the <hi>Mathematicks;</hi> live pleasantly in their Countrey-Houses; and may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out degenerating marry whom they please.</p>
               <p>The Gentlemen in <hi>Holland</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes enjoyed great priviledges; for the ancient Earls did never undertake any thing without their advice, as it is now observ'd in <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The three principall Families are the <hi>Brederodes,</hi> the <hi>Wassenaers,</hi> and the <hi>Egmonds;</hi> of whom the Proverb is,</p>

that <hi>Sitfrid,</hi> the youngest Son of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi> of <hi>Ghent,</hi> and Grandson to <hi>Didier,</hi> second Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> being fallen under his Fathers indignation and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, was afterwards pardon'd; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Wassenaers</hi> fetch their origine from a Village between <hi>Leyden</hi> and the <hi>Hague;</hi> and their name is deriv'd from the right they had in former Ages to the Waters, Ponds, and Lakes, in <hi>Holland.</hi> They pretend to be descended from that famous Captain, <hi>Claudius Civilis,</hi> of whom <hi>Tacitus</hi> makes honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Liberty.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere is no Province in the World, where the Inhabitants enjoy more liberty, than in <hi>Holland.</hi> Nay, as soon as any Slave coming from a foreign Countrey, sets his foot upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> shore, he is free. The Gentlemen are Princes and Fathers of their Families. The Countrey people when they have payed their Rents, are as free as the Citizens. If a Gentleman abuse or kill any of them, he is in great danger of losing his life, if the crime deserve it. Here is no partiality; and let every one know, that the Laws are here in their force.</p>
               <p>The Magistrates are bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Citizens Priviledges, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them from all Oppression. The
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64416:181"/>
Masters may not beat their Servants, nor the Mistresses their Maids. But above all, every one is Master at home; and it is a capitall offence to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to a man in his own House.</p>
               <p>One may travell freely through all <hi>Holland,</hi> by day and by night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of being rob'd. High-way men are never pardon'd; Theeves are sometimes, but not those among them that break into Houses, or steal Sheep in the Pasture-grounds.</p>
               <p>No body is forced to stay here any longer than he thinks fit. Here is liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conscience, and no body is forc'd to go to the Protestant Churches. The liberty of speaking freely, even of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates themselves, is too great; and that which else-where would be a crime, is here laughed at.</p>
               <p>The <hi>German</hi> Students, I remember, were once about to set up a custome, which is in use in most of the <hi>German</hi> Universities, by which the new comers are very ill treated for the first year; but the Magistrates oppos'd it, and threatned all those that should go about to introduce such a slavery, in a free Countrey.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:64416:182"/>
Here are never made any Rules a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what people onght to wear; every one wears what he pleases. Nay any body may transport as much Gold and Silver as he pleases, and no body shall hinder him, as they do in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> In a word, all that is reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is lawfull.</p>
               <p>They that say that the Nobility are not respected in <hi>Holland,</hi> are very much mistaken. For those amongst them that do govern themselves with moderation, and are familiar with their Inferiors, are infinitely beloved; but the proud and haughty are despised and hated.</p>
               <p>Here is the greatest Equality in the World. It is ordinary to hear a mean Fellow in a dispute with a Citizen, say, <hi>I am as much as you; if you be richer than I, 'tis well for you.</hi> But the wiser sort avoid such quarrels, as it is easie to do, by keeping a fit distance between them and the common people.</p>
               <p>Certainly when I do reflect upon the miserable condition of some Christians in <hi>Europe;</hi> as of the Peasants in <hi>Lytua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and almost all over <hi>Poland,</hi> where
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64416:182"/>
the Lords have the power of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, when they run away from their tyranny; in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and some other places of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> in <hi>Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> where the Gentlemen do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>Of some Voyages undertaken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Banner of <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Do not intend to speak here of the ordinary Trade that is driven by Shipping, to the Northern parts of the World; nor of that which is carried on in <hi>England, France, Spain, Italy, Germany,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>My design is to speak of those Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges undertaken within these threescore years to the <hi>Indies,</hi> which were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken upon this occasion:</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> having seized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and confiscated some Ships belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that did trade in his Ports, which were then the Mart of <hi>Europe,</hi> for the <hi>East-India</hi> Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, made some Merchants resolve to set out a Fleet of eight Sayl for the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> whereof four were to go the long way, and four others to go by the North, and endeavour to finde out a
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:64416:183"/>
passage to <hi>China,</hi> by the North-Sea; it being the shorter way to the <hi>Indies</hi> by half in half.</p>
               <p>These four last set sayl from the <hi>Texel</hi> the fifth of <hi>June,</hi> 1594. and the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth they came to <hi>Kildus</hi> in <hi>Lapland;</hi> and some time after they discover'd the Island of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> between mountains of Ice.</p>
               <p>In this journey they met no Pirates nor enemies, but great white fierce Bears, which would follow them upon the land, and in the Sea; as one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly did, for leaping into the Sea, to follow their long Boat which they had ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d out, they shot him, and hurt him; but he nevertheless following still, they threw a Rope about his neck, thinking to carry him away alive after them to <hi>Austerdam;</hi> nevertheless this furious Beast had the force to leap with his two fore-feet upon the Boat, and so frighted the Seamen, that they were all ready to leap into the Sea, had not the Rope by good luck entangled it self about the Rudder; whereupon one run him through with a Pike, and kill'd him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:64416:184"/>
They met besides with a sort of great Fish, as big as Oxen, call'd <hi>Valres;</hi> their Head is like an Oxes, and they have two Teeth that come out like Boars Tushes.</p>
               <p>At last seeing the season of the year far spent, they went back, and some dayes after met with the other Ships which had left them, and learn'd from them that they had been in the <hi>Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Ocean, which they had found full of Whales. That they had landed, and discover'd a Cross upon a Mountain, near which they had found some Sacks of Meal, and something written upon the Cross in <hi>Russian</hi> Characters. At last they all arriv'd at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> having been hindred by the Ice to go any further.</p>
               <p>The chief of these was one <hi>William Barenson,</hi> who having made the recitall of their journey, there was a second Voyage resolv'd of, under the conduct of the said <hi>William;</hi> but they met with the same obstacles again, though it were in <hi>August.</hi> They met with a Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop laden with Barks of Trees, and Geese, and such other Merchandizes,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:64416:184"/>
which waited for the <hi>Russian</hi> Fleet, which every year goes that way. They that were in the Bark did say, that within a few dayes the Sea would be so frozen, as that one might go over the Ice into <hi>Tartary.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them aboard, and presented them with Butter and Cheese, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, saying, it was fasting-day, but took some Herrings. Having left them, and seen the Countrey of the <hi>Samoctes,</hi> which they found to be a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous people, wearing Buff-skins, they steered their course to the <hi>States Island,</hi> a place which they found full of Hares, whereof they made provision. Some pass'd into the Continent, not far from the Island, and there a furious Bear kill'd two, and routed all the rest of the company, though twenty in number, and well arm'd with Pikes; at last with succour from the Ship, the Bear was kill'd. After which they set sayl for <hi>Holland,</hi> running much hazard in the Ice, but arriv'd without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loss than of those two men.</p>
               <p>The small success of this Voyage, could not discourage the undertakers
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:64416:185"/>
from venturing once more, under the conduct of the same <hi>William Barenson,</hi> to whose Ship <hi>James Heemskerke</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Commissary. Two Ships set sayl the eighteenth of <hi>May,</hi> and met with the first Ice the fifth of <hi>June.</hi> They sayled up and down till the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, without being able to meet with any passage. Wherefore one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into <hi>Holland; Barenson</hi> having steered to <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to leave it behinde him, was surprized by the Ice, and his Ship fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen up. In this extremity, some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving landed, found abundance of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, about a league within the shore; with that they built a little House, which they cover'd with the Boards of their Ship, and had Wood enough left to make fire with. The Sun forsook them quite from the fourth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> to the twenty fourth of <hi>January.</hi> Till the Sun forsook them, the Bears tormented them; but they had great relief by a sort of Foxes which they did use to catch and rost, and make warm Caps of their Skins. Their Beer and their Sack being frozen, they were fain
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:64416:185"/>
to break them with an Axe, and thaw them upon the fire; and when their Beer was spent, they were fain to melt the Snow, and drink it. At last the Sun came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but with him the Bears, who did persecute so as they were not able to stir out; of them they kill'd many, and us'd their fat in stead of Oyl to burn in Lamps. Twelfth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day being come, they resolv'd to be merry, and choose <hi>King and Queen,</hi> making their <hi>King,</hi> King of <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> and the Islands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. After some time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to think of returning home, not in their Ship, for that they could not stir; but in their Boat, which with much ado they fitted up, and set sayl the fifteenth of <hi>June,</hi> among shoals of Ice, the Bears still following them upon the Ice, and into the Sea.

               <p>IN the generall recitall of so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Wonders, we have it may be omitted some, which we here adde by way of Supplement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>North-Holland</hi> had formerly a great Lake, near <hi>Purmerend,</hi> which has been drain'd with great pains and charges; it is now a most fertile spot of ground, about 20. mile in compass. The Cattle there is the biggest and fattest of all the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is confidently reported, that in the generall contribution of the <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> towards the War, <hi>Holland</hi> gives 57. in a 100. and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> alone gives above 27. of the 57. from whence may be inferr'd, what are the riches of that Town. The revenue of the said City
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:64416:186"/>
comes to above 4000. pound a day, according to the Treatise that has been Printed of it. This year, 1650. the Excise of Beer, Meat, and Corn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farm'd out to them that bid most, was let at a 150000. pounds. Besides these, there is the Wine-Excise, the Taxes upon Houses, the eighth penny, and a thousand others.</p>
               <p>There is a Square-house before the Town-house, where all things are weigh'd; it yeelds above 10000. pound a year.</p>
               <p>There is a Glass-house, in which Chrystall-Glasses are made, not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to Venice-Glasses; as also excellent Looking Glasses, which do attract all mens admiration.</p>

They are distinguish'd into different Chambers, and make Aenig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, which if unridled carry a prize with them for the <hi>Oedipus.</hi>

I shall end by the publick <hi>Library,</hi> to shew that our Merchants have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got Learning, amongst the hurry and noise of their Trade.</p>
               <p>It is hard by the <hi>South Church,</hi> and very well stored with all sorts of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Books. The Epigram that is at the Door gives people warning how they are to behave themselves, when they are within.</p>
               <p>There is added to it a Physick-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which encreases every day, by the care that the Magistrates take to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it with rare Plants, at great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>But let us leave <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> for fear we lose our selves in the confusion of so many remarkable things; and come and rest our selves at <hi>Leyden,</hi> the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Holland.</hi> Our nearest way will be by the Lake of <hi>Harlem,</hi> for with a fair Winde we may arrive in four hours; but if the Winde be contrary, we may go by <hi>Harlem</hi> in two hours by the Channell, and then take a Chariot for six and twenty pence, which will carry us in two hours more to <hi>Leyden.</hi> When the Winde is strong, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:64416:187"/>
the way by the Sea of <hi>Harlem</hi> is troublesome, for it makes those sick that have often been upon the Sea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inconvenience; and though in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places it has not above six foot Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet not long ago a Boat with Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers was over-turn'd, and they drown'd.</p>
               <p>Though there be many tempests and storms upon it, yet within this 25 years I do not remember any ill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent but this I have now mention'd; and that great misfortune which befell the unfortunate Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> when she receiv'd the terrible news, how the King her Husband had sav'd himself with swimming, but that her eldest Son was drown'd in this unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Element.</p>
               <p>The King had left <hi>Harlem</hi> in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1629. towards the evening; the night proved very dark and tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the Lake much agitated by great Windes, when unfortunately in the obscurity, another Boat fell foul of his, and sunk it immediately. The poor young Prince was heard to cry out, <hi>Ab Sir, dear Father, pray save me!</hi>

but all in vain, for the darkness of the night hindring the distinguishing of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, it was impossible to relieve him, and so he perish'd in the flower of his youth, to the unspeakable affliction of all that were acquainted with his forwardness in all Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>The two famous Cities of <hi>Holland</hi> are <hi>Leyden</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> one is the Market of all foreign Commodities, and the other of Manufactures of all sorts. Neither is there any City that has so great a Revenue, next to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> as <hi>Leyden,</hi> as it appears by the last years Excise only upon Beer, Corn, and Cattle, which came to 50000. pound.</p>
               <p>There is wanting to <hi>Leyden</hi> a good Harbour to the Sea, without passing by other Towns, and it has been proposed to make one at <hi>Caetvic,</hi> which is but two leagues from it. Nay, the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians and Engineers having been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised with, do say the thing is feasible; others say that it cannot be, and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sea would choak up the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with Sand, or it may be if let in,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:64416:188"/>
drown all the Countrey. To which it is answered, that the securest way would be to go by <hi>Wass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>naer,</hi> and make the overture between two Mountains: but this design is now buried in oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Being one day in the company of a Mathematician at <hi>Catvic,</hi> he told me, that the Sea being calm is about half a foot higher than the Meadows about <hi>Leyden;</hi> so that if in the Spring-tides, or a storm, the Sea should make way through those Mountains of Sand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly the Countrey would be all lost.</p>
               <p>The most dangerous Winde for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is a North-West-Winde, towards the Equinox, with a storm; but God Almighty by his providence hinders these three so dangerous enemies, from assailing us all at one time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Holland</hi> is so populous, that you can hardly go a stones cast without meeting with Houses or Villages.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> Diversions are these: In Summer a Citizen shall hire a Boat for himself and his Family, to go and eat fresh-Water Fish. In Winter he shall hire a Sledge upon the Ice. They
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64416:189"/>
are not given to gaming at Dice or Cards, but will play at Bowles and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. They are not quarrelsome, nor apt to strike, but will scold and call one another all to naught, before they come to blowes.</p>
               <p>Towards Autumn, and in Winter, the Students pastime is to go and shoot at the wilde-Ducks and Geese; and if they shoot at the Countrey-peoples, as they will often out of roguery, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a scuffle, in which the weakest goes to the Wall.</p>
               <p>Their industry is most admirable for inventing, and improving other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples inventions, witness Printing, and Telescope-Glasses. The Art of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is better understood here than in any place of the World: so is Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all military Discipline; in so much that a <hi>Low-Countrey</hi> Souldier, when he comes to another Kingdome is presently made much of, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> are the best in the World at Draining, witness what they have done in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and in <hi>Britany.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>ll manners deserves admiration. But they have one odd diverting way of it, which I shall here relate.</p>
               <p>There are three Islands which serve as a bar to the Ocean: The first is the <hi>Texel,</hi> where are made excellent Chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. The second is the <hi>Ulic,</hi> where are taken great quantities of Muscles. The third is <hi>Schelling,</hi> the Inhabitants of which last are much given to Fishing, and the way that they use to catch the Fish, which they call a <hi>Sea-Dog,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleasant. They disguise themselves like Beasts, and at certain hours that these Fishes are us'd to come out upon the shore, they leap and dance before them, and by a thousand antick tricks make them follow them, and leave the shore: in the mean time those that are in Ambushcade set their Nets; then the dancers throw off their Masks, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their humane shape upon them, come upon the poor <hi>Sea-Dogs,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to re-gain the Sea are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the Nets, and made a prey to those that had diverted them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> transport salt-Fish all the World over.</p>

There is not any season in the year that does not produce some particular pleasure. For what is more pleasant, than to see the Meadows cover'd with Flowers all the Spring and Summer. Autumn produces an abundance of Fruits. The Winter is more pleasant here than any where else; for in so sad a season, the diversion of the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Channels, full of people, sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon them, is no small one. Wood is not dear here; and you shall have more for 10. pound at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> than at <hi>Paris</hi> for 15.

'Tis true, that the Windes and the Rain are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, by reason of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Sea; but the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is recompenced by the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of travelling; for if the wayes be broke and bad, you may go by Water.

and day with an infinite number of Boats.</p>
               <p>But as there is nothing abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect, <hi>Holland</hi> has its Cloudes, its North-Windes, its Rains, and its foggy Mists, which do much bate of the beauty and pleasantness of this fam'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Province.</hi>
