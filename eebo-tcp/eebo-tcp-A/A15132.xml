            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F late, perusing certaine writings which laie by me, it was my good hap to light vpon one which was full welcome: both for the profite which presently I reaped in reading of that, which before time I hadde heard, as also in regard of these our daies: wherin, if euer in any former age, these, or such like most learned &amp; godly instructions, are more then necessarie. The treatise is not long, and therefore I mind not to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie recapitulation thereof: and the rather too, because I would bee loth to dismember that, which so lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
<pb facs="tcp:15347:3"/>
and so methodically is conioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togeather. Onely this in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that it meeteth with a kinde of bad people, who were budding and sprouting vp then, but since in respecte of their outragious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, both to God, and man, without all compasse. For proofe hereof, let the lewd and shameles li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels speake, of late set out.</p>
            <p>But heerein they expresse the auncient and olde disturbers of the Church, who dealt in such manner with their Bishops then, as they doo now. The qualitie of these men at this time, shall not be particularized by me. Although if we would do as their manner is, that is, to cull out me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by name, &amp; make legendes of them, without either feare of God, loue of brother, or care of religion, perhaps they might be made to blush, as well
<pb facs="tcp:15347:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as others. But that course is vile, &amp; hardly (if at all) will we bee drawen to the practise thereof. And yet let <hi>Ireneus</hi> say what he felt by them, and thought of them. They are cruell (saieth he) they haue not the loue of God, they seeke their owne glorie, rather then the peace of the Church: for euery small cause they deuide &amp; cut in sunder the glorious bodie of Christ, as much as in them lieth, they haue peace in their mouthes, &amp; war in their hearts, they straine at a gnat, and swallow vp a Cammell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nazianzen</hi> writeth, that the like kinde of People also troubled the Church in his time, and that suche were then of diuers accompted the godliest, which did most spitefully slander their bretheren, &amp; scorneful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vse other. <hi>Omnes</hi> (saith he) <hi>per hoc docti et Catholici volumus videri, si a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lios
<pb facs="tcp:15347:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reprehendimus &amp; impios iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> that is, we do all now a daies, by finding fault with others, and accounting them vngodly, procure to our selues an opinion of learning and religion. The rest of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bishops were in the same ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as it is manifestly to be seen in their writings, especially, in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, Athanasius, Ierome, Basil, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> &amp; manie others. The learned of our age, haue likewise tasted of this cuppe. <hi>Caluin</hi> writeth that these kind of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did more slaunder him, raile vpon him and reuile him, then did the open enemies the Papists: yet that he was therewith so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually exersiced, that he made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count therof. And so <hi>Chris.</hi> as if hee had liued in <hi>Caluins</hi> time. <hi>Non tanta ab infidelibus conuitia &amp; probra, quanta ab his qui <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:15347:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fidelibus iaci videbit aliquis:</hi> that is: A man may easily see, that the faithful do not beare so many slaunders, and reproches at the handes of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, as they do of such, as seeme to be professors of the same religion. It is therefore no maruaile, though some in these daies tread in the steps of their predecessors. But for my part, I am fully perswaded, that these worthie and godlie Fathers, who of long time before, (and of late most straungely) haue bene thus set vpon, may and doo, in the testimony of a good conscience, say with <hi>Cal. I am pridem ad eiusmodi probra, quibus &amp; Prophetas, &amp; Apostolos, &amp; vnigenitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dei filium obnoxios esse video, continuo vsu obdurui:</hi> that is, long since haue I bin hardened against such slanders, from which, neither the Prophetes, neither the Apostles, neither yet the
<pb facs="tcp:15347:5"/>
onely begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> son of God, could be cleare and free. In a word, let the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill magistrates looke to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. Let them call to minde, how the Anabaptists did first deale so with the ministers of the word, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, both with words &amp; blowes, fell likewise vpon them. As for the most reuerend, &amp; godly learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our Church, the authour of this sermon, vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they yawne most, and snatch at, without all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie or truth: I know in respect of himselfe, he makes small reckoning of their doings, which in truth, are too too odious &amp; intemperate; yea sory he is, &amp; sorie againe, that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn</hi> and his <hi>Martynistes,</hi> haue giuen so great an offence to the Church of God, &amp; yelded to the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy so iust occasion of Ioy and Triumph.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue here to consider first what mooued the Apostle thus to write to <hi>Titus,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him to preach obedience to Magistrates, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we learne that obedience is necessarie, and required of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
<pb facs="tcp:15347:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thirdlie, we may also note who they be that are disobedieut, and by what notes, and qualities they may bee knowen.</p>
            <p>We reade in the fift of the <hi>Acts,</hi> of one. <hi>Iudas</hi> of <hi>Galaley</hi> a troublesome. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> reporteth) taught that by the law of God, none ought to be called Lord, but God himselfe, and that there was no obedience due to ciuil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, no tribute due vnto <hi>Caesar.</hi> Which doctrine of his was so plausible, and so well liked of the common people, that they followed him in great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and in the ende grewe into open Rebellion: Yea, it so troubled the better sort among the <hi>Iewes,</hi> euen the <hi>Pharises</hi> themselues, that they began to doubt of the matter, and mooued the question to Christ, whether it were lawfull to pa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> tribute to <hi>Caesar</hi> or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hierome</hi> thinketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this herisie was either not altogether extinguished in the Apostles time, or began then to be reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: which hee saith to be the cause why the Apostle wrote in this manner to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
<pb facs="tcp:15347:6"/>
&amp; gaue him in charge, that he should admonish them to bee obedient to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And surelie whosoeuer diligentlie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and considereth the writinges of the Apostles, shall well perceiue, that they had much to doe in their time to keepe men in due obedience to their Magistrats and Superiors. And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> often, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> very earnestly exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Seruaunts to obey their Masters, Children their Parentes, wiues their Husbands, Subiectes their Princes, and Magistrates.</p>
            <p>Now, if whiles the Apostels liued, and the Church was as yet in her Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie, the number of the Christians few, and the same vnder persecution, this doctrine of obedience was thought so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to bee taught: what shall wee thinke thereof in these our dayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all things are so corrupt, and so farre degenerated? For these are the times of which Christ speaketh, when he sayeth, that Iniquity shall abound, Charitie wax
<pb facs="tcp:15347:7"/>
cold, and that there shall bee no faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. This is the time whereof the Apostle prophesieth, when he sayth. This knowe for a certaine, that in the latter days shall come perilous tymes. For men shall be louers of themselues, couetous, disdainful, proud, cursed spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, disobedient to their parents, false accusers, fierce, trayterous, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And likewise <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude,</hi> who prophesied that in the latter times should come mockers walking after their owne lustes, which seperate themselues, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne Magistrates, and speak euill of them that are in auctortie.</p>
            <p>Whereunto the saying of that auncient Father <hi>Lactantius</hi> verie well agreeth, that towards the end of the world, lawes shal be contemned, there shal be no peace among men, no humanitie, no obedience.</p>
            <p>All which experience it selfe doth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie teach to bee most true in this our age. For when was there euer more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, when greater contempt of lawes? Now it is tome to passe, that the
<pb facs="tcp:15347:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doctrine of obedience, is lothsome vnto vs, the teachers thereof accompted time seruers, flatterers, and I knowe not what.</p>
            <p>If it were euer true that <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth, <hi>
                  <hi>Quicquid licet, minùs desidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur: quicquid non licet, fomentum accipit desiderij:</hi> Whatsoeuer is lawful, is lesse desired, what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> soeuer is not lawfull is wonderfully desired.</hi> or the common prouerbe: <hi>Nitimur in vetitum, &amp;c.</hi> We desire to doe that which wee are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. It is at this day most true.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, wee that are Preachers must now especially teach obedience.</p>
            <p>The commaundement of the Apostle is perpetuall, and at this day most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to bee obserued, and therefore wee ought not to neglect it: admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe them (saith hee) to bee subiect to Princes, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The second is, that obedience is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie<note place="margin">2.</note> and required of all; which may bee proued by diuers reasons, especiallie by foure: by the expresse worde and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
<pb facs="tcp:15347:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>It is the first commaundement of the second Table, that we should honour and obey our Parents: where, by the name of Parents, (as all learned writers do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) not they onelie are comprehended that are our naturall Parents, but those also which haue gouernment and charge ouer vs, as Princes, Magistrates, and such like.</p>
            <p>The people of God had alwaies their Magistrates and gouernors, whom they were commaunded to obey by the worde of God, yea sometimes when they were wicked and infidels.</p>
            <p>Christ payed tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest signe of subiection, and hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that those things should be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto <hi>Caesar</hi> which belong to <hi>Caesar.</hi>

            <p>Now if Christ, <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly commaunded obedience, when Princes and Magistrates were as yet infidels and enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Christe, is it not now much more to bee brged, when they be Christians?

            <p>
               <hi>Irenaeus</hi> affirmeth, that God doeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies send such Princes and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as are apt and meete for those which are gouerned, sometimes for their profit and benefit, and sometimes for their punishment and correction. <hi>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15347:10"/>The third reason, is, the commoditie<note place="margin">3.</note> that redoundeth to the Subiects by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and obeying of Magistrates. S.<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>Princes are not feareful to those that doe well, but to those that doe euill, &amp;c.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> like wise affirmeth, that <hi>Kinges and Princes are sent of GOD, to the punishment of<note place="margin">1.

            <p>The fourth reason is, the punishment<note place="margin">4.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:15347:12"/>
of those that are disobedient. It is said in the Commaundement, that those which obey their Parents, shall haue long life: then it must néeds follow, that the daies of such as are disobedient, shall be shortned. It is Gods owne law, that<note place="margin">Deu. 17. and 21 Iosu. 1.</note> such as disobey the commaundement of the high Priest, of their Parentes, or of the Magistrate, shall die the death. The horrible destruction of <hi>Corah</hi> and his companions, whome the earth for their disobedience, swallowed vp quick, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth howe greeuous a thing it is in the sight of God to disobey: So dooth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the example of <hi>Absolon, Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phell,</hi> and diuers others. Read the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, sacred or prophane, you shall plainely see, that disobedience to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, was neuer or very sildome suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be vnpunished. Experience it selfe dooth teach so much. For mine owne part, in inferior gouernments, I haue sundrie times noted, that those, which haue shewed themselues contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous against their Gouernours, haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:15347:12"/>
neuer come to bee Gouernours themselues, though they haue desired it, or else if they haue attained thereunto, haue receiued the same measure. But howsoeuer disobedient persons in this worlde escape temporall punishments, sure it is, that they shall not escape eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the worlde to come, vnlesse they repent. S. <hi>Paule</hi> saithe, <hi>That they which resist and disobey, procure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselues damnation.</hi> And in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other<note place="margin">Rom. 13. Gala. 5.</note> place, hee reckoneth disobedient persons, among those which shall neuer come into the kingdome of heauen. The Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> pronounceth an euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woe, against all those, which follow <hi>Corah</hi> in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Well then, the word of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presselie commaundeth obedience: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates are appointed of God: it is profitable, and beneficiall for vs to haue them: God plagueth and punisheth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient persons, therefore obedience is necessary, and obey wee must. So that this lesson of S. <hi>Paul</hi> may not bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten:
<pb facs="tcp:15347:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you must be content to heare it, It is our dutie to preache it. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith: <hi>
                  <hi>Admone illos vt principatibus ac potestatibus subditi sint, &amp;c.</hi> Warne them to bee subiect to rule and power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now peraduenture some will be desirous to knowe wherein obedience consisteth. Obedience consisteth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie in these foure things: first in doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which the Magistrate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and in obseruing of lawes: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in praying for the Magistrate: Thirdly, in fearing and honouring of him: Fourthly, in paying vnto him tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. Touching the firste, the Apostle saith heere expresselye, that <hi>Titus</hi> must teach them to doe the Magistrates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. There are many that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse obedience in wordes, but deny it in déede: they yeelde a certaine generall kinde of subiection, but performe it not in specialties. They graunt (as the Schooleman saith) <hi>Reuerentiam sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectionis,</hi> but they denie, <hi>
                  <hi>obedientiam ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionis:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15347:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
They graunt reuerence of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,</hi> but denie, <hi>obedience to that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded.</hi> Whereas they ought to performe both. Why call you me Lord Lord (saith Christ) and doe not those things which I commaund you? Not he which said he would doe his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commaundement, and did it not, was counted obedient, but rather hee which said hee would not doe it, and yet did it. And to what purpose serue either Magistrates or lawes, if they bee not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Populus</hi> (saith <hi>Chrysostome) <hi>non obsequens Principi, similis est populo principem non habenti, imo etiam deteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, &amp;c.</hi> That people that obeyeth not the Prince, is like to them that haue no prince, yea and woorsse too.</hi> And againe hee saith: <hi>
                  <hi>Ne mihi dixeris esse regnum, vbi est legum transgressio.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer say that to be a kingdome, where lawes be neglected and broken. <hi>Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num amisisse videtur</hi>
               </hi> (saith a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher) <hi>
                  <hi>qui obedientiam amisit. Solitudinis &amp; vastitatis Dominus esse videtur Rex
<pb facs="tcp:15347:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ille, cuius dicto ciues non obediunt: Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt esse Principes, quando qui parêre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, mandata spernunt.</hi> He seemeth to me to haue lost his kingdome, who hath lost the obedience, dew vnto him, from his subiects. Nay the king seemeth rather to be a Lord of vn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited and desert places, whose sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects obay not at his command. Then kings leaue of to be Princes, when as such as ought to obey them, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne their lawes.</hi> Therefore it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal point of obedience to obserue lawes, and to doe that which is commaunded. But some peraduenture will say: must we obey the Prince in all things, hee commaundeth? Is there no exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What if he commaunde that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods commaundment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is easie and common. There is no powre giuen to any man (saith <hi>Basill</hi>) either to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund that, which God hath forbidden, or to forbid that, which God hath commaunded: therefore if any such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement happen to be, thou must
<pb facs="tcp:15347:14"/>
answere with the Apostles in the Acts,<note place="margin">Actes. 4. &amp; 5,</note> that it is better to obey God then men. But take this with thée also, which <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> noteth vpon this place: that this Rule doth not onely belong to that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which is required in the Subiect towards the magistrate, but in that also which is required in Seruants towards their Maisters, in wiues towards their Husbands, &amp; in Children towards their Parents: for neither must the seruaunt obey his maister, nor the wife her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, nor children their parents in those things which are contrary to Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements. And therefore measure thy obedience towards the Prince and Magistrate, by that which thou thy selfe requirest of thy seruant, wife or children. Certaine it is that thou must obey Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and Lawes in all thinges, not contrary to the word of God.</p>
            <p>The second poynte of Obedience is, to<note place="margin">2</note> pray for Magistrates. The people of<note place="margin">Baruc. 1.</note> GOD being in captiuitie, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to pray for the long life of the
<pb facs="tcp:15347:15"/>
King of <hi>Babilon,</hi> and of his sonne. S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth, that aboue all thinges, praiers, supplications, intercessions, and giuing of thankes bee made for all men, for Kinges and those that are in authori tie. <hi>Tertulian</hi> testifieth, that in his time the Christians in all their assemblies, prayed for the Emperours and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of this world.</p>
            <p>The people of God were commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to pray for <hi>Nabuchadonezer</hi> a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine King and a Tyrant. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth to pray for Kinges and Princes,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.</note> when they were (as <hi>Augustine not<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>eth</hi>) enemies to the Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>The Christians in <hi>Tertulians</hi> time prayed for their Emperours and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates being persecutors, and shall not wee praie, and exhorte to praie for her Maiestie our naturall Prince, mercifull, Christian, and a constant defendor of the true Religion of the Church of Christ? Here then is the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, who is so far from praying for Princes, that he curseth them, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:15347:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
against them, if they displease him neuer so little. Likewise those fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call spirits are likewise here reprooued, which dissalow and mislike this manner of yerelie celebrating this day, (to giue God thankes for the great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full benefits, which we enioy thorough his goodnes by the ministerie of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, whome it pleased him as this day fiue and twentie yeares to place in the Throne of this Kingdome, and to praie vnto him for her long life and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) as though wee did it superstitiouslie, or dedicated the day vnto her, as to some Sainct, whereas in deede wee doe but our duetie, and that which is most law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs to doe. <hi>Mardocheus</hi> (as wee reade in the booke of <hi>Hester</hi>) without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie expresse commaundement of God ordeyned that the <hi>Iewes</hi> shoulde yere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lie celebrate and keepe holie the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and fifteenth day of the moneth Ader, in remembrance of the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the <hi>Iewes</hi> by the ministerie of <hi>Hester,</hi> from the blouddie conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that this our sacrifice of praying &amp; thankes-giuing, is most acceptable to God, and approued of al godlie men: and I most hartely beseeche GOD, that we may continue this exercise in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and vppon this occasion, euen to the worlds ende: and the Lorde blesse and preserue her Maiestie, encrease the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

            <p>The third poynt wherein obedience<note place="margin">3</note> consisteth, is, in fearing and honoring of Magistrates. The wise man saith, my<note place="margin">Pro. 24. Rom 13.</note> sonne feare God, and honour the Kinge. S. <hi>Paul</hi> likewise willeth that honour be giuen to whom honour is due, and feare to whome feare is due. Likewise Sainct<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> saith: <hi>Feare GOD, honour the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By feare and honour is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not onely the outward gesture of the bodie, reuerence of wordes, &amp;c: but also the inward good will, and reuerence of the heart and minde, which especiallie is required of all subiects towards their Princes and Magistrates. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Persians</hi> contynued verie long, and greatlie increased. <hi>Isocrates</hi> saith, that the cheife and principall cause thereof was, for that the <hi>Persians</hi> aboue all other nations, did most of all feare, honour, and reuerence their King. God graunt that wee may also performe our
<pb facs="tcp:15347:17"/>
duety in this poynt as we haue iust cause to doe.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last office of obedience<note place="margin">4</note> is, to helpe and relieue Princes and<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> Magistrates when neede requireth. Christ himselfe payed tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the Apostle commaundeth tribute to be giuen to whome tribute is due.</p>
            <p>Obedience then consisteth in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of lawes, praying for the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, fearing and honouring of him, and in paying vnto him tribute. And thus much of the second part.<note place="margin">3</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the third I haue to declare who they be, that are disobedient, and offend against this commaundement of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.</p>
            <p>There are three kindes of men giltie of disobedience. The Papist, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist, the conceyted and wayward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The Papist restraineth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Magistrate, more then is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient. The Anabaptist taketh it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather away. The conceyted person o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth and disobeyeth at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15347:17"/>The Papist restrayneth the authority of the Magistrate in two respects: in the respect of persons, &amp; in the respect of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. For hee denieth the Magistrate to haue authoritie ouer Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, especiallie ouer the Bishoppe of <hi>Rome:</hi> hee denieth him also to haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in Ecclesiasticall causes: but this error is soone confuted. For, that he hath authoritie ouer Ecclesiastical persons, it is manifest, Christ himself being an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall person, and the heade of the Church was subiect to <hi>Caesar,</hi> as I haue before declared. S. <hi>Paule</hi> saith. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery soule submit it selfe to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior power: be exempteth none, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chrisostome</hi> expounding this place sayth: <hi>
                  <hi>Ista imperantur omnibus, &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotibus &amp; Monachis, non solúm secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laribus &amp;c: Etiam si Apostolus sis, si E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelista, si Propheta, siue quisquis tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem fueris.</hi> These commaundementes are enioyned vnto all, to Priestes, to Moonkes, and not to lay men alone, &amp;c. yea though thou bean Apostle, or
<pb facs="tcp:15347:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Euangelist, or whatsoeuer els.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chrisostome</hi> doeth also include the Pope in this precept of obedience. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> from whome the Pope claymeth his Supremacie, speaking of the obedience due vnto Kinges, calleth the King <hi>most excellent,</hi> that is, aboue all others, and greater then all other: neither dooth he exempt himselfe, much lesse those that clayme to bee his successors. <hi>Colimus</hi> (saith <hi>Tertulian) <hi>Imperatorem sic quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo nobis conuenit, &amp; illi expedit, vt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem a deo secundum, post quem primu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ante omnes homines, Deos.</hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was a Priest of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; if he had knowne or remembred the Pope to haue bin aboue the Emperour, or equall vnto him, hee woulde not haue said, the Emperour had bin next vnto God: the first after God, and before all other men and Gods: <hi>Chrisostome</hi> saith that the Emperour hath no peere vppon earth, and calleth him: <hi>
                  <hi>Summitatem &amp; caput omnium super terram hominum.</hi> The chiefe &amp; head of al men vpon earth.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15347:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Many of the Popes themselues haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged this superioritie in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours; for they haue bin complayned of vnto them: pleaded their causes before them, receaued iudgement by them, and yeelded thereunto: as it is to be read in their owne histories: yea diuerse Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours haue deposed diuers Popes from their Popedomes, as it is also manifest in the same histories. One of their owne Canonists saithe, that the Emperour may require of the Pope an accompt of his faith. And <hi>Gratian</hi> himselfe, where hee dooth most of all exempt the Pope from the iurisdiction of the Emperour, maketh this exception: <hi>
                  <hi>Nisi fuerit a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de deuius, aut in crimine haereseos depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendatur.</hi> Vnlesse he be slid from the faith, or infected with the sinne of herresie.</hi> Therefore it is manifest that the Emperour hath authoritie ouer Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons, euen ouer the Pope himselfe. That hee hath also authoritie in Ecclesiasticall causes, it is easelie prooued.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15347:19"/>When I say that the Emperour or Ciuill Magistrat hath authority in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall causes, I meane not as the Papists, and some other malitiously ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, that hee hath authoritie to execute Ecclesiasticall functions, proper to the ministers of the word, as to preache the Gospell, to minister the Sacraments, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate bishops and such like, which was neuer giuen to any ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, neyther yet did any Chrystian Prince take it vpon him. But by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in Ecclesiasticall causes, I meane that it appertaineth to the Office &amp; due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Ciuill Magistrat to see the commandements of God obserued, true Religion mayntained, euery man in the Church to doe his duetie, and to prouide that all things be done therein decently, and in order according to the rule of the Apostles. That Christian Magistrates ought to haue this authority, it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. For first, the custodie of both Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles is committed vnto them, which they can not performe accordinglye, vnlesse
<pb facs="tcp:15347:19"/>
they haue authoritie in Ecclesiasticall causes: The first Table conteining thinges méerely Ecclesiasticall.</p>
            <p>The Prophet calleth Kinges the nursing fathers of the Church, and Quéenes the nursing mothers: which title is giuen them in vaine, if they haue no authoritie in matters of the Church.</p>
            <p>All the good Kings and Magistrates of the old Testament, as <hi>Iosua, Dauid, Salomon, Asa, Iosaphat, Ezechias, Iosias, &amp;c.</hi> had and vsed this authority. For they did not onely rule ouer the Priestes, but also prescribed vnto them what they should doe in diuine matters, as in Sacrifices, Circumcision, Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, Cursings, dedication of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, casting downe Idolatrie, Idols, and such like. Some of the Papistes themselues confesse, that the Kinges of the olde Testament had this authoritie. That Christian Kinges also hadde the same, it appeareth by sundrie examples. <hi>Elutherius,</hi> Bishoppe of Rome, who
<pb facs="tcp:15347:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
liued within two hundreth yeares of Christ, writing to <hi>Lucius</hi> King of this lande, calleth him Goddes vicar within his kingdome, and sayth, that it pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to his dutie, to make lawes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the worde of God, for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of his kingdome, as well in matters of Religion, as in matters of pollicie. <hi>Eusebius</hi> calleth Constantine the great, <hi>
                  <hi>quasi communem quendam Episcopum a Deo constitutum:</hi> As a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Byshoppe appoynted by God.</hi> And it is certayne, that the sayd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine did not onelie call the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> but had herein also the chiefe gouernement and superioritie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded controuersies betwixt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: hee prescribed vnto them a rule, according to which, they should iudge matters then in question &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iustinian,</hi> and other godlie Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, made lawes concerning publique prayers in the Church, concerning the Trinitie, Baptisme, the Sacrament of the Supper, Festiuall daies, ordering
<pb facs="tcp:15347:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Byshoppes, against Heretiques &amp;c. <hi>Socrates</hi> saith, that since the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours were Christians, the matter of the Church, especiallie depended vppon them, &amp; that the greatest councels were called by them. <hi>Nabuchodonozer</hi> (sayth Augustine) when his heart was peruerted, sette vp an Image, and made a law for the worshiping thereof. But when his heart was conuerted, he pulled it downe, and made a law for the true worshipping of the true God. <hi>In hoc e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim</hi> (sayth he) <hi>
                  <hi>Reges Deo seruiunt, sicut eis diuinitùs praecipitur, in quantum sunt Reges, si in suo regno bona iubeant, mala prohibeant: non solùm quae pertinent ad humanam societatem, verùm etiam quae ad diuinam religionem.</hi> In this behalfe, Kings serue God (for so God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that they are Kings) if in their kingdome they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point good things, as also forbid that which is naught: and this not onely in those causes which concerne the outward Communion, and societie
<pb facs="tcp:15347:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of mans life, but also such, as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto Gods Religion and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</hi> And againe. <hi>
                  <hi>Seruiunt Reges ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae Christo, leges ferendo pro Christo.</hi> The Kinges of the earth doe serue Christ, in making and appoynting lawes for Christ.</hi> And writing against the <hi>Donatistes</hi> (who graunted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the authoritie of the Emperour, in causes ecclesiasticall, at their pleasure) he sayeth. <hi>
                  <hi>An fortè de Religione fas non est, vt dicat Imperator? cur ergo ad Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratorem vestri venerunt legati? cur e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um fecerunt causae suae Iudicem? non secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi quod ille iudicaret.</hi> Is it not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth lawfull for the Emperour to commaund, concerning causes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? why then come your Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors vnto the Emperour? why did they apoynt him Iudge in their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, if they entended not to stand to his iudgement?</hi> In the same Booke he writeth that the Emperour made pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniarie lawes against those which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them-selues Christians, and yet did
<pb facs="tcp:15347:21"/>
not communicate with the vniuersall Church, but gathered them-selues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in priuate Conuenticles: which lawes although he sometimes misliked, yet vpon better aduisement, hee did not onelye allowe of them, but also thought them to bee most profitable &amp; necessary.</p>
            <p>It appeareth therefore, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Magistrate hath authoritie in eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes, in manner and fourme as I haue declared. And therefore the Papistes, in abridging this authoritie, must needs be found guiltie of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But I would to God it consisted herein only: it reacheth further, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they list, they altogether take away the authoritie of the Magistrate.</p>
            <p>The Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> vsurpe vnto themselues power, to place and displace Emperors and kings at their pleasure, to deliuer their subiectes from their oath of obedience, to mooue them to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and if that will not serue, to suborne some priuilye and secretlye to murther them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:15347:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>Pope <hi>Zacharie,</hi> who liued seuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares and more after Christ, was the first that tooke vpon him that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but diuers afterwards put it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth did not onelye excommunicate <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and animated his subiectes to revell against him, by deliuering of them from their oath of obedience, but when that woulde not serue, sought also waies and means secretly to murther him, by hiring one to let a stone fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top of the church vppon the Emperours head as hee was praying, but God preuented that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize by punishing the murtherer, and crushing him in peeces with the same stone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paschalis</hi> the second continued the same course against the same Emperor, and in the end caused his owne Sonne to rebell against him. <hi>Alexander</hi> the third delt in like maner against <hi>Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the Emperor, and betrayed him to the <hi>Turke.</hi> So did <hi>Innocentius</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:15347:22"/>
fourth with the Emperour in his time, and at the length poysoned him. It were too long to reherse all examples which might be vsed in this matter: doeth not experience teache vs, that they contynue their practise euen at this time? The Lorde defend her Maiestie from them, and confound their deuises against her: Certein it is that they are enemies to Princes, and guiltie of disobedience.</p>
            <p>The second kinde of men, offending against this precept of the Apostle, are<note place="margin">2.</note> the Anabaptists, who thinke it not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Christians eyther to bee Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, or to obey Magistrates, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselues vpon that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle writeth in the fift to the <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Stand in the libertie wherin Christ hath made you free, &amp;c, and such like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, forgetting that which followeth in the same Chapter. Take heed you make not your libertie an occasion to the flesh: whereby it appeareth that Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie is not of the flesh, but of the spirit: not of the bodie, but of the minde: not of
<pb facs="tcp:15347:23"/>
freedome from being subiect to men, but from subiection to sinne and to death. <hi>Lex spiritus vitae</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>
                  <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum me reddidit a iure peccati &amp; mortis.</hi> The lawe of the spirit of life through Iesus Christ, hath made me free from the lawe of sin and death. Rom. 8. 2.</hi> Christ himselfe obeyed the Ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> commaund Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Seruants, Children, Wiues, and Subiects, to obey their Maisters, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, Husbandes, and Magistrates. The Gospel doeth not destroy common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welthes, but establisheth them. And Christian religion taketh from no man that, which is due vnto him. Therefore the opinion of the Anabaptists is of it selfe absurd, and needeth no confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The third kinde is of those that are<note place="margin">3</note> conceited, and wayward, who onely obey when they list, wherein they list, and so long as they list: men delighted with singularitie, whome nothing can please, but that which themselues doe inuent.
<pb facs="tcp:15347:23"/>
Of whome the Apostle S. <hi>Peter</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, when he saith. <hi>
                  <hi>Dominationem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnunt, audaces, praefracti, qui gloria prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet 2.</note> 
                  <hi>non verentur maledictis incessere.</hi> They dispise authoritie, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, and stande in their owne conceit, which feare not to speake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of them that excell in worship.</hi> They contemine Lordship and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie. He saith not that they condemne Lordship and Superiority, but that they contemne it, being bold, wilfull, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which are not afraide to speake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of those that are in authoritie.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> in like manner writeth of them in his Epistle. S. <hi>Paul</hi> giueth vnto them these titles. Louers of<note place="margin">2. Tim. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:15347:24"/>
S. <hi>Augustine</hi> also speaketh of these kinde of men, when he saith. <hi>
                  <hi>Non iam (vt vetus prouerbium fertur) quod volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sanctum est, sed etiam quando volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; quàm diu volumus.</hi> Not now (as the old Prouerb is) is that holy which we fancie to be holy, but the same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, when wee fancie, and so long as we fancie.</hi> For nothing is holie, but that which they wil haue to be holie, and that when they will haue it holie, and as long as they will haue it holie, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. I my selfe doe knowe and am able to proue, that some things are now holie (in their iudgement) which before they compted vnholy, and likewise something now to be vnholie, which heretofore they haue set downe to be holie. But these are holie ones, and may not bee touched. Therefore I will cease to speake anie more of their persons, and come to the qualities, and notes whereby they and al other disobedient persons may be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and knowen.</p>
            <p>It followeth in the Apostle: admonish
<pb facs="tcp:15347:24"/>
them that they speake euill of no man, that they bee not contentious. And the Apostle <hi>Iude,</hi> speaking of disobedient persons; saith, they are murmurers and quarrilous, wherby I gather that there are two notes, by the which disobedient persons may bee knowne: Euill and slaunderous speaking, and contention: else the Apostle woulde not haue giuen <hi>Titus</hi> speciall charge, to warne disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent persons of these two crimes. Well then, those that are disobedient, may bee knowne by their euill speaking of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and by contending against or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and lawes. Touching the first: the nature of man it selfe, is prone and bent to speake euill of two kindes of persons principallie: of those which haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement in the Church, as of Bishops, Preachers, &amp;c. And of those which haue gouernement, in the common wealth, as of Princes and Magistrates: the deuill also prouoking thereunto. For by spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king euill of the one, the Religion that they professe and preache, is slaundered,
<pb facs="tcp:15347:25"/>
the good successe of the Gospell hindred, and by speaking euill of the other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of superiours is wrought in the harts of the subiects, whervpon spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all disobedience.</p>
            <p>That Bishoppes and preachers, and such as haue gouernment in the church, haue bene alwaies subiect to the slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tongues of disobedient persons, it appeareth by the example of Christ him selfe, who though he neuer offended ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in life or doctrine, yet could hee not auoide the malitiousnes of the tongue. They called him Samaritane, they sayd he had a deuill: they accused him for kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping<note place="margin">Iohn. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

Therefore in purging of himselfe, he faith not, which of you accuseth me of sinne, but which of you can conuince me of sinne. Neither doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> require that a Bishop should not be blamed, but that he should be blameles: and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth <hi>Timothie,</hi> that hee receiue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Bishop or minister, any accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without two or three witnesses. It
<pb facs="tcp:15347:25"/>
hath beene the lot of Bishops, &amp;c. at all times to be ill spoken of. Basill saith, that in his time, whosoeuer could raile most of the Bishops in their sermons, (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yong Preachers then did) were best liked of the people, and coumpted most perfect, and most holy. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned, that the state and condition of Bishops in his time was far worse, then the condition of the Apostles in their time.

            <p>The wise man speaking of all slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,<note place="margin">Pro. 24.</note> saith, that they are to be abhorred of men. <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, that hee will perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him that slaundreth his neighbour. The Law pronounceth him to be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed which backbiteth his neighbour. S.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> placeth backbiters and slaunderers among those that shall neuer enter into the kingdome of Heauen. The Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> writeth in his Epistle, that <hi>Micha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> the Archangell, when hee contended with the deuill about the body of <hi>Moses,</hi> did not giue vnto him any railing spéech: <hi>Michaell</hi> the Archangell did not rayle
<pb facs="tcp:15347:27"/>
vpon the diuell, no not to his face. Then they that rayle vpon Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, not to their face, but behind their backes, are no Archangels, nay, they are no Angels, nay, they are deuils. For the deuill was the first Calumniator, as his name testifieth, and is the father of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters and slaunderers, euen as he is of liers. Certaine then it is, that back bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting &amp; slaundering is an horrible crime, and a manifest signe of disobedience. And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iude</hi> ioyne them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, saying, they contemne superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and are not ashamed to speake euil of those which are in authoritie. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in this place to his precept of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, like wise ioyneth this, that they speake euill of no man, as though hee shoulde say, if they speake euill of men, they cannot be obedient.</p>
            <p>The second note is Contention. For<note place="margin">2.</note> the Apostle addeth: <hi>admonish them that they be not contentious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Contentious persons cannot bee but difobedient: for they are proude. Pride

So long as there is amongst you (saith the Apostle) emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, contentions, and factions, are you not carnall, and walke according to the flesh: And in the epistle to the <hi>Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gala. 5. Iam. 3.</note> hee placeth contention among the works of the flesh.

<pb facs="tcp:15347:29"/>
horrible is the crime of contention and yet is it oftentimes coloured and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the name and title of religion, of zeale, and of perfection. So hath it bin in times past, and so is it at this day. <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaeus</hi> speaking of contentious persons writeth thus: <hi>
                  <hi>Propter modicas &amp; quasli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet causas, magnum &amp; gloriosum corpus Chr. conscindunt &amp; diuidunt, &amp; quantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ipsis est, interficiunt: pacem loquentes, &amp; bellum operantes: verè liquantes culi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem, &amp; camelum transglutientes.</hi> For<note place="margin">Lib. 4. cap. 62.</note> meane matters and euery trifle, they diuide and teare in peeces, yea, and as much as in them lies, they kill too, the great &amp; glorious body of Christ: They talke of peace, &amp; practise war: Euen such they are, as straine at a gnat, and swallow vp a cammell. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen,</hi> like wise speaking of the same persons, saith thus: <hi>
                  <hi>Spirituales isti fastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osi, iudicantes singulos, &amp; condemnantes, &amp; pro nihilo omnia ducentes, si ita libue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, abcedunt communionem nostram ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut impiam recusantes.</hi> These spirituall

proud men, iudging &amp; condemning al but themselues, and accounting of euerie thing too too lightlye, when they are so disposed, with-drawe themselues from our companye, and refuse it as vngodly and wicked.</hi> And againe: <hi>
                  <hi>Qui ingentes rixas mouent ex re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vel sermonibus paruis, veletiam non diuinis sed humanis motibus incitati, sibi quàm plurimos asciscunt insaniae suae soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os, dum contentioni atque insolentiae suae, magnificum &amp; venerabile omnibus fidei nomen imponunt, faedissimae inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tionis suae causam, honest issimi huius vocabuli specie colorantes.</hi> Such as be occasioners of great braules, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of some things or words of smal moment, or els mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therevnto not by godlye, but worldlye motions, they drawe vnto themselues companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, while they ascribe to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and pride, the excellent and reuerend name of fayth, thereby sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing the cause of their beastlie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, with the visor of this holie and

                  <hi>Aurem populi mulcent, &amp; quicquid dixerint, legem Dei putant.</hi> They curry fauour with the people, and therfore what they say, is thought of them to be the word of God.</hi> To bee short, <hi>Chrisostome</hi> saith, that those which deuide the church, least they shold seeme to do it for contentions sake, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that they teach more perfect things, and that they are wiser then others.</p>
            <p>Whether these sayings of the ancient Fathers may aptly hee applied to those that make contention in the Churche at
<pb facs="tcp:15347:30"/>
this day or no, I referre it to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such as be indifferent. Howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it is, contention is the plague &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilence of the Church, and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth likewise. Euery kingdom diuided in it selfe, commeth to decaye, and euery house diuided in it selfe, will be made desolate, as Christ saith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nazianzen</hi> compareth the Church, troubled with contention, to a ship vpon the Sea, tossed with waues and winds, and in daunger of enemies, where in the Marriners disagree amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, and will not followe the aduise and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of their maister and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour.</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Nazianzen</hi> compareth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious persons to madde men, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes set their owne houses on fire, thinking them to bee other mens: and smite their owne Parents, supposing them to be their enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Basill</hi> likeneth the Church rent with contention, to the Citie <hi>Ierusalem</hi> when it was besiedged by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasianus:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15347:31"/>
for it had enemies without, and it was diuided within: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end was destruction. And is not this our state at this time? Are we not compassed about with enemies abroad? &amp; do we not contend amongst ourselues within? &amp;c: wel then, let vs at the length leaue of contending, &amp; liue in peace, one with another.

Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peace, peace of conscience, and peace amongst your selues.
