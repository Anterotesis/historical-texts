            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To my Worthy and Honoured Friend
Dr. IOHN WOODWARD,
Professor of Physick in Gresham Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
and F. R. S.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE forming of these brief Remarks
upon Mr. <hi>Whiston's Theory of the
Earth</hi> was occasion'd by one of your Letters
which you were pleas'd to honour me with: for
your mentioning that Vndertaking of his, and
your cursory Glance upon it revived in me the
thoughts which I a little before had of making
some Reflections on that Attempt. And the
Motive to it was this, my apprehension that
this Learned Gentleman had not dealt fairly
with the <hi>Mosaick</hi> History, which (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
is a fault of a very high nature. I chiefly
argue with him about his abandoning the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sense, or the genuine meaning of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Creation.</hi> But I hope this may excite
a Resolution in you to go further, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to rifle his several <hi>Hypotheses,</hi>
which I question not you are perswaded are
founded on a precarious bottom. In defence of
<pb facs="tcp:57877:3"/>
               <hi>your self</hi> you will be obliged to say something
to him, for you are a <hi>Theorist</hi> as well as he,
and the <hi>Earth</hi> is your common Subject. But
to the <hi>Theoretick</hi> part you have added <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
and <hi>Observation,</hi> whereby you have
cultivated this Theme to a Prodigy, and are
going on still to oblige the World with greater
and nobler Discoveries, the Consummation
of which we all with great impatience expect
and long for.</p>
            <p>As to this little Essay of mine, the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller
had notice of it, and in this Idle Time
(this <hi>Stationers</hi> Vacation) was pleased to
call for it, to set the Press on work. I was not
wholly averse to the making it Publick, because
I knew there is this one thing to commend it,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Goodness of my <hi>Design,</hi> which is to
conciliate a Reverence to the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and particularly that part of them
where the First Formation of all things is
treated of. In the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi>
Moses presents us with the Primitive State
of the World, and acquaints us what are the
First Principles and Rudiments of all things,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Chaos</hi> and <hi>Light.</hi> All Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
gross and dark bodies were framed out of
the first; and all Etherial, bright and tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
bodies were educed out of the second.
Whatever belongs to this <hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi>
which are of a resembling nature had its
<pb facs="tcp:57877:3"/>
original from the former; and the Ether,
Sun, and Stars, which appertain to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
part of the World, had their rise from
the latter. These are the General Sources,
these are the Primitive Materials of all visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
beings in the World; the one passive, dull
and inert, the other active, subtile and brisk.
On these two Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Chaotick
Matter,</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Fire</hi> there might be
built a solid System of <hi>Natural Philosophy,</hi>
every way congruous to these and the other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of the Divinely Inspired Philosopher
in this Chapter. The contrary is that which
I make bold to censure and animadvert upon
in the insuing Papers, wherein I have shew'd
that Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi> makes his Philosophick
Principles jarre with Reveal'd Truth, and
suffers his Mathematicks to confront the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>As to the Second Part of my Reflections,
wherein I doubt concerning the Earths mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about its Axis, it may be I differ from
<hi>you,</hi> and from the generality of <hi>Vertuoso's</hi>
at this day. But truly I am not so much a
<hi>Tychonian</hi> as to for swear the <hi>Copernican</hi>
Hypothesis: but the Truth of the matter is
this, when I was treating of the most Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
Points of <hi>Divinity,</hi> that is, when I
was asserting and vindicating the <hi>Being</hi> and
<hi>Providence of God,</hi> I was unwilling to found
<pb facs="tcp:57877:4"/>
these or any thing belonging to them upon an
infirm and unstable basis, upon a dubious and
disputable Doctrine, and which had not long
prevail'd in the Learned World. Such I take
the Opinion of the Circumgyration of the
Earth to be: and therefore till I could be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
satisfied about the reality of it, I
thought it was safest to aquiesce at present in
the other Doctrine, and the rather because it
is suitable to the Mundane System which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
presents us with, whose Literal sense of
the Account of it is not to be slighted by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Philosophers. According to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Sage the Grand Parts and Divisions
of the Material World were ranged and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
according to the Specifick <hi>Gravity</hi> of
them (though the Laws of Gravity or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
supposed Mechanism were not every where
observ'd in the <hi>Creation,</hi> nor any where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly,
it being below the Divine Soveraign Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to confine himsef to such Laws) our
<hi>Earth</hi> and the Planetary Bodies, which are
of the same matter with it as to the main, have
the lowest place, because they are heaviest:
the <hi>Waters,</hi> which are Ponderous in the next
degree to the <hi>Earth,</hi> are accordingly situated
next above the superficies of it: the Atmos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere
of the <hi>Air,</hi> conformably to the degree
of its weight, is above the <hi>Waters:</hi> and the
<hi>Ethereal, Luminous</hi> and <hi>Firy</hi> bodies, as
<pb facs="tcp:57877:4"/>
being lightest of all, have the uppermost place
This is the Order and Method of the <hi>Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
according to <hi>Moses</hi>'s account of it, but it
is inconsistent with the <hi>Copernican</hi> Circumvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Earth and his System of the
Heavens. If it be said that this Terrestrial
Globe is a despicable Spot, a Speak, a Point in
comparison of the Vast and Spatious Congeries
of the Sun and Fixed Lights, I grant it is so
if it be meant of their Bulk and Quantity; but
then this must be remembred that though the
Earth be inferiour to the Solar body and the
Stars on the account of Magnitude, yet it is
far superiour to them upon other Accounts,
which are of mighty weight and moment: all
which I have particularly mention'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon in the <hi>Second Chapter</hi> of that
<hi>Discourse</hi> wherein I undertook to prove the
<hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of an Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
and All-Wise Being from the Fabrick
and Sructure of the World. If any person will
be pleased to answer those Arguments, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
me about them, I faithfully promise him
I will be his Proselite, and I will declare that
I am not enclin'd any longer to think that the
Place of our Residence is not a Voluble Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net.
I have lived to see Monsieur <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s
Philosophy introduced into the Publick
Schools with great applause, and at last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded:
and this may be the fate of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernican
<pb facs="tcp:57877:5"/>
Hypothesis, though it hath been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
some considerable time by the Greatest
Philosophick Wits, who have now rendred it
a Modish Opinion. Yet there may be a Time
when its Fashionableness shall expire, and
when this Seat and Habitation of Mankind
shall return to its <hi>Rest</hi> again.</p>
            <p>But why do I thus trespass? Truly, <hi>Sir,</hi> I
must partly impute it to <hi>you;</hi> for seeing you
are wont to indulge me a great Freedom when
I have the felicity to Communicate with you,
I have made use of that Liberty now, and
thereby am become Tedious. For which I beg
your pardon, and request nothing more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
than that you would vouchsafe me
the honour of letting me be Esteem'd (what
I so sincerely am)</p>

            <head>OF THE
Mosaick Doctrine
OF THE
CREATION.
BEING
Some brief Remarks on Mr.
Whiston's New Theory of the Earth;
In Vindication of the Mosaick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Creation.</head>
            <p>I Have in another place endeavour'd to
prove (and I hope to the Satisfaction
of the Learned and Judicious) that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s
Narration of the <hi>Creation of the
World</hi> is Literal and Historical, and that it is
a true and just Account of the whole Process
of that Divine Work. And this I undertook
to make good in opposition to the fond No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which had possess'd some men's heads,
and had been divulg'd by their Pens, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>Moses</hi> is not to be understood according to the
<hi>Letter,</hi> that he speaks to the capacity of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57877:6"/>
Blockish <hi>Brick-makers</hi> that were newly come
out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and scarcely understood Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sense, and therefore any Story of a
Cock and a Bull would serve them. When
<hi>Moses</hi> speaks of the <hi>Creation,</hi> we are not to
understand him as if he intended to give any
True and Real Account of that matter, we
must not think that he would trouble the
brains (if you can suppose they had any) of a
company of Dull Slaves with Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.
And when he speaks of the formati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> and several things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to it, we must not be so silly as to fancy
a Literal meaning of the words, but we must
take it all in a <hi>Mystical</hi> and <hi>Allegorical</hi> Sense.
Thus the known <hi>Theorist</hi> dictates to the
world. Where, by the way, observe how
weak and shallow such suggestions are, as if
the first Chapters of <hi>Genesis</hi> were to be read
only by the people of that Age in which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
lived, as if none but Drudges and Slaves
were to look into these Writings; or, as if
these were so ignorant and stupid that they
could not understand a plain and downright
Narrative; or, as if these thick skinn'd La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers,
who were not capable of <hi>Natural
Philosophy,</hi> could judg of <hi>Allegories;</hi> as if
those who could not understand any thing of
the plain <hi>History of the Creation,</hi> were able to
comprehend <hi>Mysteries, Parables, Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks,
Mythologies;</hi> in short, as if an Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
and Mystical Sense were easier than a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
one. These things duly weigh'd are
sufficient to shew the Vanity of that Writer's
Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57877:6"/>
Notwithstanding this, another and a <hi>New
Theorist</hi> hath lately so far imbibed his Notions
as to shew little regard to the <hi>letter</hi> of <hi>Moses's</hi>
Writings: which I take to be a very false
Step, and a dangerous one, in a person espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
that is no Profess'd <hi>Deist,</hi> and by his
Character seems to own the Authority of the
Scriptures. It is very strange and ominous
that such a one should give so little deference
to <hi>Revelation</hi> and assert things which palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
interfere with the Sacred and Infallible
Records of <hi>Moses.</hi> His Grand Proposition is
this, that <hi>the Mosaick Creation extends no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Earth,</hi> or (as he expresses it at
other times) <hi>Nothing but the Earth only is the
subject of the Mosaick Creation.</hi> This every
where occurs in his Treatise, so that there is
no need of assigning any particular page, as I
shall do afterwards when I cite any other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
out of his Book. But who is there that
hears this Proposition named, and is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to think that this Learned <hi>Theorist</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to expose the Sacred History of <hi>Moses,</hi>
and to erect a doctrine that absolutely runs
counter to the first words of the Bible, <hi>In the
beginning God created the heaven and Earth?</hi>
Here is a dichotomy of the Whole Visible
World into <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and therefore
we cannot but infer thence that the <hi>Heavenly
Bodies</hi> are a portion of that System which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
here describes. These words are an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
and Abstract of the <hi>Creation,</hi> more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
and distinctly delineated afterwards
in that chapter, and consequently the <hi>Mosaick
Creation</hi> extends to the <hi>Heavens</hi> as well as to
the <hi>Earth.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57877:7"/>
But what saith the <hi>New Theorist</hi> to this?
Why, he grants that in the foremention'd
Text <hi>the Heaven</hi> signifies the Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Sun, Moon, and Stars, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that it is to be so understood elsewhere, and
particularly in any part of this first chapter of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> for according to him <hi>heaven</hi> here is
no more than the <hi>Atmosphere of the Earth,</hi> or
the <hi>Region of the Air, p.</hi> 11. Which is a very
precarious and groundless Interpretation, for
though it is true the region of the Air that
surrounds the Earth is call'd <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament
of heaven</hi> in this chapter, as well as in
other places of the Sacred Volume, yet we
are to know that both these words <hi>heaven</hi> and
<hi>firmament</hi> are used here in a Different Sense.
There is the <hi>Lower</hi> or <hi>Aerial</hi> Firmament, <hi>v.</hi>
6, 7. and there is the <hi>Upper</hi> or <hi>Etherial</hi> one,
<hi>v.</hi> 14, 15, 17. And so <hi>heaven</hi> is either the
<hi>Lower Heaven,</hi> which is no other than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of the Air, or the Atmosphere of the
Earth; of the <hi>Vpper Heaven,</hi> which is the
<hi>Aether,</hi> or Region of the Sun and Stars. The
former of these Heavens was the work of the
<hi>second day,</hi> and is distinctly mention'd in <hi>v.</hi>
8, 9. The latter is expresly named in <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15.
and was the work of the <hi>fourth day.</hi> The not
attending to this distinction of the <hi>Two Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
or <hi>Heavens</hi> in this Chapter hath been
one occasion of those Mistakes and Misappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
which this Ingenious Author and some
others of late have fallen under. But can
there be any thing plainer than this, that
there was a Double Firmament or Heaven,
one (<hi>viz.</hi> the Expanse of Air) <hi>to be between
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57877:7"/>
the waters and the waters, v. 6. i. e.</hi> to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
between the Seas below and the Clouds
above; the other (<hi>viz.</hi> the Ethereal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panse)
to be the seat and receptacle of the
Sun and Stars, <hi>v. 16, 17? God made two great
lights, he made the stars also, and God set them
in the firmament of the heaven, to give light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How then can it be true that <hi>Moses</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the <hi>Creation</hi> reaches no further
than the <hi>Earth?</hi> Doth not this History make
particular mention of that Higher <hi>Heaven</hi> or
<hi>Expanse</hi> where the <hi>Luminaries</hi> are? doth it
not acquaint us what was the <hi>design</hi> of the
Allmighty in making it? Doth not <hi>Moses</hi> in
plain words relate that the Fourth Days
Work was the creating of the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
from <hi>v. 14. to 20th?</hi> Doth he not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Celestial <hi>Lights</hi> in general, <hi>v,</hi> 14, 15.
and then particularly <hi>the two great lights, v.</hi> 16.
that is, the Sun, Moon, and other Planets,
for they are all comprehended under these
<hi>two,</hi> as being the most Eminent: which is no
unusual way of speaking in Scripture. And
the <hi>Stars</hi> also (in the same verse) <hi>i. e.</hi> the
<hi>Fixed Luminaries</hi> of Heaven are mention'd in
contradistinction to the Other <hi>Lights.</hi> Is it not
strange now that, notwithstanding this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
any man should start up, and venture
to maintain that <hi>Moses</hi> in this Chapter speaks
only of the formation of the <hi>Earth?</hi> Could it
be expected that one who hath so great a
share of Reason and Sense should thus talk?
Is it not prodigiously absurd that by <hi>Lights in
the firmament of the heaven,</hi> and <hi>Two Great
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57877:8"/>
Lights,</hi> and <hi>the Stars also</hi> all of them either by
day or by night <hi>to give light upon the earth,</hi>
we should understand the <hi>Earth,</hi> and no
more?</p>
            <p>Another late<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Nichols's</hi> Conference with a Theist Part. 1.</note> Writer saw how inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
harsh and incongruous it was to do so,
and therefore though he was pleas'd to exclude
the <hi>Stars, i. e.</hi> the Fixed Stars from this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet he grants that not only the <hi>Earth</hi> but
other <hi>Planets,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> it self were the
matter of the Creation in this chapter. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
as for the <hi>Stars,</hi> this Gentleman makes
sure work with them; for he dashes the word
<hi>Stars</hi> out of the Text, which no Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
or Critick ever ventur'd to do. But then
indeed, as if he repented of his rash act, he
refers the word <hi>Stars</hi> to the verb <hi>rule,</hi> and
forces a strange and unheard of sense on
the place. I wish this Ingenious Writer had
not too much gratified the <hi>Deists,</hi> whom he
undertook to confute, by flying to so precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and shifting a Gloss on a plain Text of
Scripture.</p>
            <p>But our present Author out doth this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and will have neither <hi>Sun</hi> nor any
other <hi>Planets,</hi> nor <hi>Stars</hi> to be part of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
recorded by <hi>Moses,</hi> although express
mention be made in this chapter of the <hi>Lights,</hi>
both greater and lesser, which were <hi>set</hi> or
placed by God at the Creation in the Higher
<hi>Firmament:</hi> and although it be said <hi>Gen. 2. 1.
thus (i. e.</hi> as was described in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter)
<hi>the heavens and the earth were finished
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57877:8"/>
and all the host of them.</hi> Than which we could
not have plainer words to express the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Frame</hi> of the World, and every thing
whatsoever that belongs to it, for the Inspired
Historian assures us that not only <hi>the heavens
and the earth</hi> (which terms themselves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the whole Mundane Scheme) were
finish'd in the six days Creation, but he adds
that <hi>all the host</hi> of them were finish'd likewise,
that we might not have any ground of surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
(with this Writer) that <hi>Mojes</hi> gives us not
an Account in the first chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> of
the Whole System of the Visible World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Yet our Author confidently avers that in the
foremention'd place <hi>the heavens and the earth
signify the Terraqueous Globe alone, with its Air
or Atmosphere, without including the Whole
Universe, or so much as the Solar System, p.</hi> 10.
To me it seems very wonderful and surprizing
that any Man of Learning and lngenuity should
so openly and plainly confront the Sacred
Writer, and misrepresent his Clear Account
of the Creation of the World. I declare I
would not have troubled the Reader with
any of these <hi>Reflections,</hi> were it not upon
this consideration only, that this <hi>Theorist</hi> appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
shocks the Divine Revelation of the
Holy Scriptures, and contradicts the plain Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the First Inspired Penman. I take it
to be a very ill work to deal thus with this
part of the Bible, for the rest of it may as
well be treated after the same manner, and
then in a short time we may give up this Book
to the <hi>Deists</hi> and their fellows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57877:9"/>
It is not from want of Deference to Mr.
<hi>Whiston</hi> or his Parts and Worth that I thus
speak: I will be of the first that shall applaud
his Ingenious Attempts; but that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts
a Censure from me is this, that he hath
the boldness to offer to the publick a <hi>Theory</hi>
which is wholly inconsistent with the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Moses.</hi> And in this Censure all persons
that pay a due reverence to the Scriptures,
must needs concur with me. It is ill in a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of his Figure especially to undervalue the
Holy Text, and thereby to conciliate in
others (who are not so well acquainted with
it) a disregard of the Sacred Penmen and
their Writings. This will be the natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of such Undertakings, and I am afraid hath
been; for if some men were not <hi>Deists</hi> before
their perusal of such Writings, these will
make them so, because they see there is no
Respect given to <hi>Revealed</hi> Truth, and there is
no care taken to conform their Notions about
the <hi>Creation</hi> (of which <hi>Moses</hi> only can give us
an account) to the book of <hi>Genesis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us hear what the Worthy Author
saith in defence of himself and his Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
First, he tells us, that <hi>the Capacities of
people could not bear an universal account of the
origin of things, p.</hi> 80. And again, <hi>The Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of the Iews to whom</hi> Moses <hi>peculiarly wrote
were very low and mean, and their Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
very small, or rather none at all in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick
Matters, p.</hi> 82. And so p. 83. <hi>The rude
and illiteratte Iews were newly come from the
Egyptian bondage, and destitute of the very first
Elements of Natural Knowledg:</hi> and this he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57877:9"/>
gives as a Reason why he asserts that the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
which <hi>Moses</hi> gives of the Creation
reaches no further than the <hi>Earth.</hi> Such je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>june
and childish Arguings can never have
any power on Rational Minds, who delight
not to be entertain'd with fancy, but solid
Truth. But no man can count this Reasoning
to be of the latter sort, for the Capacities of
the people were able to bear a plain Relation
of the formation of the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Bodies, no
less than of the <hi>Terrestrial</hi> ones. The Jews
might as well have understood <hi>Moses</hi> telling
them that the <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
as when he tells them that the <hi>Earth</hi>
was created. And accordingly we find that
he relates the former of these, no less than the
latter, though this <hi>Theorist</hi> pretends (even
against the express words of the History) that
there is no such thing. And who but this
Author and his Brother <hi>Theorist</hi> could have
dreamt that there is any need of <hi>Improvements
in Philosophick matters</hi> to understand that the
Sun and other Luminaries of heaven were
made by God on the <hi>4th.</hi> day of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
            <p>And I should here also take notice of a
great Mistake, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Book of <hi>Genesis
was peculiarly wrote to the Iews who came out of
Egypt,</hi> as he speaks in the same place. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
the design of penning it was more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
it was intended for <hi>all succeeding Iews</hi>
(to speak of no others at present) not only
such as were <hi>Illiterate</hi> and <hi>Rude,</hi> but those of
sufficient Knowledg and Understanding: and
surely these might be of sufficient capacity to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57877:10"/>
bear a plain and short Narration of the making
of the <hi>Heavens</hi> as well as of this <hi>Lower World.</hi>
This shews that there is no foundation for the
Opinion which this Ingenious Writer hath es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poused,
but I hope will have thoughts of being
divorced from by what I have or shall sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest?</p>
            <p>Secondly, he tells us that though the <hi>Sun</hi>
and other <hi>Planets</hi> were not part of the Creation
which <hi>Moses</hi> relates, yet they are inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Narrative of the <hi>Six days Work,</hi> because
he had a mind to gratify the dull ignorant
people, the <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>illiterate Iews</hi> he spoke of
before. Those Heavenly Bodies are fetch'd
in here <hi>to comply with the Vulgar Notion, that
they are part of the Clouds, or belong to the region
of the Air. p.</hi> 21, 22 It is true, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
in the Holy Scriptures to condescend in
some expressions to the Capacity of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
and there is an Instance of it in this very
Chapter, v. 16 but this is a quite different
thing from giving a Set Narration of a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
when there is really no such thing as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
Which is the case here, for this
Writer holds that <hi>Moses,</hi> to condescend to the
apprehensions of the people, tells them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly
that the Sun, Moon and Stars were
created on the 4th day, and placed in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Firmament, though there was nothing
of that nature, nothing <hi>created,</hi> nothing <hi>then</hi>
made, nothing <hi>in that place</hi> Set. If it were
only <hi>Impertinency</hi> that was charg'd upon
<hi>Moses</hi> by the <hi>Theorist,</hi> viz. that he brings into
his Diary things that are nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57877:10"/>
that the hooks in the <hi>Solar System</hi> into
the History that appertains only to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
World,</hi> we might bear with it (though
it is an ill Imputation, and unworthy of the
Inspired Writer) but when he charges him
with Deceit and Falsity, it is not to be suffer'd.
<hi>Moses</hi> (as he grants) pretends to speak in
this Chapter of Matter of Fact, to relate the
distinct time and proper place when and
where things were done, and yet this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not True and Real, but a misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and a false account of things; for
whereas <hi>Moses</hi> mentions a certain Time and
particular Day when the Lights of heaven
were created, this Author peremptorily denies
that they were created at that Time, and on
that Day: and whereas <hi>Moses</hi> tells us that the
Luminaries were <hi>set in the firmament of heaven,</hi>
he saith the true place of these bodies is not
assign'd them, p. 18. However <hi>Moses</hi> records
it in his Journal, right or wrong, to please
(and at the same time to deceive) the dull
People. He and his Abettors would excuse
themselves by saying, it is only <hi>concealing the
Truth,</hi> but that is apparently false, for here is
Actual Deception and Falsifying, because
here is a Positive and Downright relating of
what was not True, and yet delivering it as
True. As to what this Worthy Author saith,
that here is a compliance with the Common
Notions, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Sun and Stars are part
of the Clouds, or belong to the Region of the Air,</hi>
he makes the Vulgar more Simple and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
then they are, to shew himself more wise
than others in his interpretation of the place.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57877:11"/>
And especially he forgets here (though he
mentioned it before) that the Jewish Rabble
were come lately from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and there we
know there were seldom any Clouds, there
being constantly a Clear and Serene Sky, so
that it was Impossible they should be bred up
with this notion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sun was seated
in the Firmament of the Air where the
Clouds are. This was not thought of by our
Author, otherwise he would not have averred
that <hi>Moses</hi> here accommodates himself to the
Popular Humour and apprehension, and that
he spoke to those of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation who
who were unlearned and Ignorant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he offers this as an other ground
of his strange Interpretation, that though
<hi>Moses</hi> makes mention of the Sun, Moon and
Stars in his Diary of the Creation, yet these
great Luminaries of the world <hi>were made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and only now placed,</hi> or seem to be placed,
<hi>in our Firmament,</hi> p. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. <hi>It is not necessary,
saith he, to believe that these bodies were then
first created when Moses makes mention of them.</hi>
p. 14. Which is against the whole tenour,
scope and coherence of the Chapter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Stile and Expressions in every
part of it, which all run in the <hi>Preter-perfect
Tense,</hi> not in the <hi>more then perfect Tense,</hi> as he
would have it understood. Who can think
that the Narrative concerning the <hi>fourth days
work</hi> is to be Understood in a <hi>different</hi> way
from all the Rest? All things belonging to
the <hi>other</hi> days works are set down exactly,
and according to the matter of Fact, but here
he fancies it is otherwise, the stile varies, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57877:11"/>
there was no such thing as this days work:
so that there was a Double <hi>Sabbath</hi> according
to him, God rested from the works of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
on the fourth and on the seventh day.
But however to fill up the space, <hi>Moses</hi> faith
something and makes us believe that there
was something done. And this he doth to
suit himself to the Capacities of the Illiterate
and Vulgar. Whence it might be inferred that
in the Rest of the Chapter he turns himself
to the Learned and Wise, but then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
differs from himself, for he had inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us before that among the <hi>Iews</hi> at that time
there were no Philosophers, but that they
were all Idiots and Blockheads. These are
the strange and wild notions of our <hi>Theorist</hi>
and yet they are swallowed down, (though
I hope but by few besides himself) rather
then the Literal and Plain History of <hi>Moses</hi>
shall take place, rather than he will adhere to
the Genuine sense of the Text. And he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
acknowledges that all the other parts of
the Chapter, excepting what relates to
the <hi>Fourth days work,</hi> are to be taken other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that is, they are meant of what was really
done on those Particular Days which are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
and there is no reason imaginable to
make any Exception as to the Fourth day.
He would come off by suggestions that <hi>the
Sun, and Moon and Stars are then said to be
made or created when they became Conspicuous,
and their bodies distinctly Visible,</hi> p. 23. so that
according to this New Expositor they were
not <hi>made</hi> till there was a clear Day or Night
to <hi>shew</hi> them. The Author of this Conceit
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57877:12"/>
is two Learn'd to persist in it, and too ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
not to blush at it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, an other profound Reason why
the Heavenly Bodies are thus placed by <hi>Moses</hi>
was to prevent Idolizing of them. It was
<hi>to shew us the unreasonableness of all sorts of Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry,
or of the worship of any visible beings,
though never so useful and glorious.</hi> p. 81. Nay,
he tells us that <hi>the securing of the Iews from the
adoration of the host of heaven could not otherwise
have been provided for.</hi> p. 28. Till the force
of this Reason can be apprehended we may
truely say, there was poor <hi>Provision</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> yea none at all. Unless he
means all the stars, Fixed as well as others
(which his Hypothesis will not allow of) it
could not be designed to obviate or hinder
Idolatry: this every one cannot but apprehend.
Or, can we imagine that the most Holy God
would obviate <hi>Idolatry</hi> by downright <hi>Falsify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
Can we think that <hi>Moses</hi> was inspired
to <hi>Lye,</hi> that the Heavenly bodies might not
be <hi>worship'd?</hi> For so runs the Argumentation of
this Gentleman, <hi>Moses</hi> makes the Jews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in this chapter that God created the Sun
and other Luminaries on the fourth day, and
that they belong to the Earth, and a part of this
System, though there is no such thing; but
this he feigns as an Antidote against the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Host of Heaven. One would
not have expected such a poor way of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from a man of <hi>Postulata</hi>'s and <hi>Lemmata</hi>'s.
Who would think that one so well vers'd in
<hi>Hypotheses, Phaenomena's</hi> and <hi>Solutions</hi> should
discourse so weakly? But this it is to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57877:12"/>
the Sacred Text, and not to adhere to
the easy and obvious meaning of the Holy
Ghost in these Writings, and in this Chapter
more particularly. It is this that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
our Learned <hi>Theorist</hi> to such strange
and unaccountable fancies; it is this that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
him to defend his Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
six days Creation extended no further than the
bare Earth, and that the whole System of the
Heavenly Bodies is excluded from this His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of <hi>Moses,</hi> although in that very History
he finds it clearly recorded that the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi>
and <hi>Stars,</hi> by which <hi>day</hi> and <hi>night</hi> are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,
are part of the Six days Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Next, I will observe that he is pleased to
inform us of a New Calculation of Time:
<hi>in the primitive state of the world days and years
were all one.</hi> Book 2. p. 81. And afterwards,
<hi>Both these Periods are exactly coincident, and both
are performed in the same space of time.</hi> And
then he thinks good to apply it, <hi>The Works
of Creation were finished in six days, that is six
years,</hi> he saith. But how will he be able to
reconcile this with <hi>Gen.</hi> I. 5? <hi>The evening and
the morning were the first day:</hi> and the same is
said of all the other days of the Creation.
Here <hi>an evening</hi> and <hi>a morning</hi> are made the
just limits of a <hi>day,</hi> and therefore a <hi>day</hi> at the
Creation of the world was not a <hi>Year,</hi> for
there is a greater number of <hi>evenings</hi> and <hi>morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
in the compass of a year. And so when
we read that six evenings and six mornings
were spent in the works of the Creation, we
may rationally infer thence that these amount
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57877:13"/>
not to six Years. And this Sagacious Writer
would have made this Inference himself if he
had not been tempted to the forsaking of the
plain, intelligible and obvious sense of the
words, and changing the easy and natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of Scripture for a forced one.</p>
            <p>Again, he thinks fit to symbolize with his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Theorist,
and to raise the same Objection
against the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Creation that he did. For
thus you hear him objecting, p. 50 51. <hi>The
length of the days assigned is wholly disproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to the business done upon it. The Third day
hath two quite different, nay incompatible Works
assign'd it And the Earth with its furniture takes
up four entire days, when the sun, moon and
stars are crowded into one single day.</hi> And the
Improbability, yea and impossibility of the
Works ascribed by <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Sixth day</hi> are
asserted by him, Book 2. p. 89, 90, 91. These
Cavils might perhaps have become some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
<hi>Lay-Deist</hi> but they are unworthy of a
person that bears and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Badg, and
who is supposed to believe <hi>Moses</hi>'s writing,
and not to find fault with Inspired History.
Are <hi>we</hi> to judg of the <hi>Proportion</hi> of the Days
Works at the Creation? Are <hi>we</hi> to set the
Almighty his Task? are shallow heads to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the Operations of the Omnipotent Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator?
Must they measure every Days pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
at the first formation of the world
by certain Rules and Assignations of their own?
This is intolerable, and no <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
would have acted thus, for he could not
but know that the Methods of a Divine and
Infinite Agent transcend the conceptions of

weak and finite minds, and that the Supreme
Being is not confined to our Proportions, but
acts as he pleases. Natural and Common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
are not the same with those Primary
ones. We must not argue from our ordinary
Generations to that which was at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of all things. There was an other way
and method observ'd, and it is irrational
and senseless to make these a Pattern to them.
Here was the Immediate hand of God, and
therefore it is no wonder that the beginning,
procedure and finishing of these <hi>Days Works</hi>
were of a different nature from those Works
that have been since. There being an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and Miraculous exertment of
Divine Power, it is as unreasonable as it is
Irreligious to find fault with the Distribution
of them. It is rash folly to expect <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Congruity</hi> in every Production, and to
look for <hi>Mechanick Laws</hi> in the erecting
of the Universe, in the System of the
Heavens, in the Planetary Bodies, in the
Sun and other Globes of Fire. It is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
to think that <hi>Mechanism</hi> was observ'd
in the formation of these. But of this I will
speak more anon.</p>
            <p>Only at present I take notice of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Two <hi>Theorists</hi> as to the Main,
(though this latter in one place severely
chastises the former for the false steps he
hath made in his <hi>Theory,</hi> p. 76, 77.) There
is a perfect Union and Friendship between
them in the point of enervating the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
History; only they do it after a <hi>different</hi>
manner. The <hi>Old Theorist</hi> (now we may
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57877:14"/>
call him so, since this hath dubb'd himself
the <hi>New one</hi>) directly and professedly rejects
the plain sense of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Text, whereas
this pretends to own it, but at the same time
miserably wrests and perverts it. The one
openly declares that what <hi>Moses</hi> saith is not
matter of Fact, but the other comes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
<hi>in part</hi> that it is an Historical
Account, but denies that it is suitable to the
Reality of things: it is a History, but False.
The former plainly and in downright terms
owns his dislike of the <hi>Literal</hi> meaning of
that part of <hi>Genesis,</hi> but the latter though he
admits of the Literal signification, yet craftily
and sophistically distorts the sense of the
words, and puts a force upon them. The
first uses more freedom and ingenuity, telling
the world without more ado that the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical</hi>
sense is not to be admitted; the second
pretends to own the Account of the Creation,
as to the very Letter, but baffles it all by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
Expositions. Thus though the two
<hi>Theorists</hi> take a different Method, yet they
unite in exposing the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Writings.</p>
            <p>It is Melancholy Reflection when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how men are hereby taught to vilify
the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to dispute the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Verity,
to quarrel with the <hi>Creation,</hi> to look upon the
several Stages and Processes of it as feigned,
and because they are not adjus<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to such
Measures and Proportions as these persons
fancy, to vote them to be false and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
What can a well meaning and sober Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
think when he finds our present Author
disparaging and traducing the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57877:14"/>
as <hi>unreasonable, unequal; irregular, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent,
disproportionate, disagreeable to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom, unsuitable to the nature of things?</hi>
for these are the Epithets he bestows upon
it, p. 57, 65. What can he think when he
finds him professedly <hi>Ridiculing</hi> of it, p.
57. and representing it <hi>as unbecoming the
simplest Artificer?</hi> What can any man think
and imagine, I say, but this, that our <hi>Theorist</hi>
hath a mind to null the Authority of <hi>Moses</hi>'s
Writings, to lessen the esteem of other parts
of Scripture, to set Revelation and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
at odds, to vacate all Reveal'd Truth,
and in a word, to gain Proselytes to <hi>Deism?</hi>
I am exceedingly troubled to let such words
as these go abroad into the World; but I
should be much more so, if I did not upon
this occasion deliver my thoughts, If I did
not freely tell the world what my Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are as to this matter. I never taught
my Pen to write either for Ostentation, or
for Preferment, but I have labour'd to bring
it up an obedient servant to Truth, and I
hope it will never be ashamed of so Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a Master. In so Sceptical an Age as we
live in it becomes us not to be Indifferent;
yea, we are obliged to be very Warm and
Concern'd, and not to let <hi>Temper</hi> (as 'tis
now fashionably call'd) chill our <hi>Religion,</hi>
and betray the <hi>Truth.</hi> And I use this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
the rather because I deal with a Person
of Ingenuity, who approves of a due Liberty
in Discourse, and will both give and take it.
I only suggest what Standers-by may <hi>think</hi>
concerning his way of Writing, not what
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57877:15"/>
he <hi>designs,</hi> for I will not entertain an ill thought
concerning him as to that. I only remonstrate
against his unwary giving <hi>occasion</hi> to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to cavil at the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Account of the
Creation, and thereby to open a door to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuating
of all the Historical part of Scripture.</p>
            <p>But what are the Reasons that are assigned by
this Ingenious Gentleman and his Associates
why they reject the <hi>Mosaick</hi> doctrine about the
Formation of the World? They are these four
especially, which I will briefly touch upon.</p>
            <p>First, They oppose <hi>Moses</hi>'s Account of the
Creation because it favours not their Opinion
and Conceit of the existence of some Other
People in the World besides those of <hi>Adam's</hi>
race. This Author talks of the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi>
not only <hi>inanimate</hi> but <hi>animate and Reasonable
in the other Planets,</hi> p. 40, 41. And he is at
it again p. 58. <hi>There may be millions of other
Species of Noble Creatures not inferiour to</hi> Man,
p. 91. And therefore the <hi>Mosaick</hi> History
is a poor mean thing, because it takes not in
those other Inhabitants of the World, it
brings us no tidings of the people that dwell
in the Moon. But they should rather argue
thus, the <hi>Adamick</hi> race, and no other is
mentioned by <hi>Moses,</hi> and thence we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
conclude that there is no other, for
it being <hi>Moses's</hi> business to set down the
<hi>Origin and Rise of Mankind,</hi> if there had been
another stock of them, he would certainly
have told us of it. But he doth no such
thing; yea, on the contrary, he assures us
that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were the first Persons
that were created, and particularly that <hi>Eve
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57877:15"/>
was the Mother of all living,</hi> Gen. 3. 20. <hi>i.e.</hi>
the source and Original of all men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that are in the world: and therefore
an <hi>Other</hi> Generation of Humane kind is a
mear dream and fiction. But it is probable,
say they, that the Moon and other Planets
are furnish'd with Animals like our selves,
seeing they are as capable of Inhabitants as
our Earth. I answer, No man can tell that.
Though they be gross and solid bodies, and
therein be like our Terrestrial Globe, yet they
may not be a fit dwelling for any sort of
Living Creatures, for Man especially. And
indeed why should any man think that Men
like our selves were originally placed in the
<hi>Planets,</hi> when we are assured that these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Bodies were made for the <hi>Use of Men
upon Earth only?</hi> But of this afterwards.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they fancy that <hi>Moses</hi>'s Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Creation is not suitable to the
Greatness and Vast Extension of the World:
they are of opinion that he talks too much of
the <hi>Earth,</hi> and gives too Magnificent a
Character of it, whereas the <hi>Smallness</hi> of it
deserves no such thing. Accordingly this
Author insists a long time upon this, p. 54,
55, 56. And urges that it is an Inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Spot in respect of the Vast <hi>Heavenly</hi>
Bodies, which stand Still till that wheels
about. For this reason they discard <hi>Moses,</hi>
and are not a little displeased with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is no <hi>Copernican.</hi> But these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are to be told that they weakly argue
from the Vast Proportion of the rest of
the World in comparison of the <hi>Earthly</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57877:16"/>
Globe, for 'tis not <hi>Greatness</hi> and <hi>Bulk</hi> that
give a value to things. They discourse idly
and injudiciously who extol the Orbs of
<hi>Heaven</hi> merely because they are Vast and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and despise the <hi>Earth</hi> because it is but
a Point in regard of them. No man of true
and generous Philosophy can argue thus:
No, it is impossible he should, unless he
can first prove that <hi>Bulk</hi> is <hi>Worth. Iudea</hi>
was but a spot in respect of the Whole
Earth (the same that the <hi>Earth</hi> is in
respect of the <hi>World</hi>) yet God made
choice of this small inconsiderable portion of
ground to be the Scene of the most Glorious
things that ever happen'd since the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
Why then may we not think, or
rather why do we not believe it (seeing
it is so Evident and Bright a Truth) that
the Supreme Being created this Pittance
of Earth for great and glorious ends, to be
the Stage of the Worthiest transactions in the
world, and consequently to dignify it above
all other parts of the Universe, be they
never so Great and Large? And it is certain
he did so, and we may see it plainly in the
First Chapter of <hi>Genesis.</hi> It is observable
that the Whole Material World is divided
into <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> V. 1. and therefore
this latter, the <hi>Earth,</hi> can be no mean part
of it. And we cannot but take notice that
this poor Pightel, this <hi>Moaicum</hi> of Earth
(as you may call it) is described and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by <hi>Moses</hi> as the Main and Principal
Work and Concern of the All-Mighty, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57877:16"/>
preferable to all the Heavenly Bodies, and
the Whole Universe.</p>
            <p>Therefore we have no reason to quit <hi>Moses</hi>
for <hi>Copernicus,</hi> but to believe that the <hi>Earth,</hi>
though so small a Globe, is of greater dignity
than all the Celestial System, than all the
Planetary and Fixed Lights. They that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
otherwise betray a great Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Soul and Meanness of Spirit, because
they set a value upon Space and Quantity,
and dote upon Roomth and Magnitude,
which are of no real worth and esteem: but
at the same time they undervalue the Order
and Appointment of the Soveraign Marker
and Disposer of the World, who plainly
shews us the Transcendent Dignity and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative
Excellencey of the <hi>Terrestrial System</hi>
in his allotting more Time for the creating of
that and what belongs to it than all the rest
of the World, and would thereby convince us
that the <hi>Earth,</hi> as small as it is, the Noblest
and Choicest Part of the World.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They can't be brought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that the Heavenly Bodies, yea and the
Whole World <hi>were made for the use of Man:</hi>
and on this account likewise (as well as those
before mention'd) they cast off the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
History of the Creation, because it favours
not his Opinion of theirs, but represents
Man as the Lord of all the Creatures, and
him for whom (next to the Divine Being)
all things were made, and more particularly
the <hi>Heavens</hi> round about him. Our <hi>New
Theorist</hi> can't indure to hear of this: it is a
doctrine which he utterly explodes, and in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57877:17"/>
order to that depretiates and vilifies <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi>
p 89<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> debasing him to the nature of a
<hi>File</hi> or a <hi>Worm,</hi> in the Works of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So low, so ignoble, so groveling is he
in his thoughts, and so injurious to his <hi>own
kind.</hi> It is true, he would seem to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
Mankind as a Noble and Glorious
Creature, p. 90, and he takes notice of the
Dignity of Man, Book 4. Chap. 1. p. 253:
but then we are to remember that it is usual
with this Author to clash with himself:
what he asserts in one Part of his Book he
renounces in another, as might be evidenc'd
in several Instances, but that is not my busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at present. Though 'tis highly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that there are any other Creatures of
humane kind that receive any advantage and
profit from the Creation, yet he declares
that <hi>it is not wise and rational, it is not worthy
to be believ'd of the All-Wise God</hi> that he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or solely created the World for our use,
p. 70. He pronounces it <hi>inconsistent with the
Divine Wisdom to make thousands of glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
for the sole use of a few fallen and rebellious
creatures,</hi> p. 69. And after he had enlarg'd
upon it, he concludes that <hi>it argues the most
extravagant degree of folly,</hi> p. 71. But softer
terms would have become him, when he was
speaking of so high a matter: and I question
not but he would have used them if he had
Thought before he spoke, that is, if he had
thought and consider'd how Noble a Being
Man is, and that he was design'd by his
Maker to be the Flower and Top of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and the Glory of the Visible World,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57877:17"/>
and that he hath the peculiar honour to have
his Nature united to the Deity: He that
hath such apprehensions of Man, can't think
it strange that even the Sun, Moon, and
other Planets which more nearly environ
him, and even the Fixed Globes of Light
and Fire, though at a vast distance from him,
were created for his Use and Service in some
manner or other. They were made to shed
their <hi>Influences</hi> on Mankind here on earth,
(which is express'd by their <hi>Ruling the day
and the night,</hi> Gen. 1. 16, 18.) and <hi>to give
light upon the Earth,</hi> which also is twice men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
<hi>v.</hi> 15, 17. Even the vast multitude
of <hi>Fixed Lights,</hi> which are meant by the
<hi>Stars,</hi> v. 16. or at least are comprehended
under the <hi>host of heaven,</hi> Chap. 2. V. 1. were
made for this very purpose, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the <hi>Service of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is confirmed from what we are told
concerning those Glorious Creatures, the
Angels, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are <hi>Ministring Spirits,
sent forth to minister</hi> for Mankind, more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<hi>them who shall be heirs of salvation,</hi> Heb. 1
14. It is no wonder that the <hi>Heavens</hi> and all
the Glorious Bodies in it are Servants to
Men, when the very Celestial Inhabitants are
so. It would have been accounted a wild
and extravagant Notion that those Superiour
Beings should be Waiters and Tenders on
the inferiour ones, unless the Infallible Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
had assured us of it: but now being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of this, we may be reconciled to that
other Truth, that the <hi>Heavens</hi> serve Man,
and that the <hi>Sun</hi> and all the <hi>Luminaries</hi> are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57877:18"/>
Servants to the Earth, and officiously roll
about it, whilst it stands to receive their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.
This is congruous to the Divine
Greatness and Majesty, who hath made <hi>Man</hi>
his Vice-gerent in this lower world, and hath
constituted the Earthly Globe the place of his
Residence, in which respect it is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than all the Heavenly Bodies. But I
have spoken something of this in an<note n="*" place="bottom">O the Existence and Providence of God, Chap. 2.</note> other
place, and therefore shall add no more
now.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and lastly, they hold that the
Formation of the World was according to
the strict laws of the <hi>Mechanick</hi> or <hi>Corpuscular
Philosophy;</hi> and therefore seeing <hi>Moses</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
it not as such, they give no credit to his
Writings about this matter. It is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
alledged by our present Author that his
New Hypothesis of the Earth is exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the laws of <hi>Mechanism,</hi> and
thence he concludes it to be Authentick.
But the Consequence ought to be denied for
this reason, because he can never prove that
the Creation of the World was comformable
every ways to the <hi>Mechanism</hi> to bodies and
the laws of Common Nature. We must not
think that the Origin of all things was in the
same manner with the After-productions.
Rather we are to conceive that the ordinary
way and method which have been observ'd in
Nature ever since, were not observ'd at the
Creation; for Common and Second Causes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57877:18"/>
had nothing to do then, the Divine Power
and Influence peculiarly interposed, and the
Creation was a work of Infinite and Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los
Power and Wisdom. An Immediate
and Extraordinary Hand set things on work
at the first erecting of the World, ayd conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no <hi>Mechanical</hi> Laws can explain it.
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> know our Author seems to agree to this,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Book 3. Chap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>The change of the Chaos,</hi> saith he, <hi>into an
habitable world was not a mere result from any
necessary laws of Mechanism independently on
the divine power, but is the proper effect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
and interposition of Providence.</hi> Nay,
that the Whole Work and Process of the
Creation was not from mere <hi>Mechanick</hi>
Laws, but from the immediate operation of
the All mighty, and an Extraordinary and
Miraculous Power, he asserts in some pages
together, Book 4. Chap. 1. where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in several Particulars of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But so it is, this Gentleman hath a faculty
of jarring with himself, for in other places he
disowns all this in three whole pages (36,
37, 38) he argues about the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Chaos
from the <hi>Properties of bodies,</hi> from <hi>the manner
of their productions,</hi> from <hi>the law of Gravitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and expresly avers that at the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Earth all was done <hi>according to
the known laws of matter and motion,</hi> and
therein mistakes and misinterprets the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
Creation. Besides, he would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57877:19"/>
that in the Scheme of the Mosaick
Creation <hi>bodies alike in nature have an unlike
original,</hi> and again, <hi>bodies unlike in nature have a
like original,</hi> p. 65 and that the <hi>Light appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the creation of the Sun from whence it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived,</hi>
&amp;c. he could not possibly with any
consistency of Sense have discours'd thus, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he had supposed that all that was done in
the <hi>six days</hi> was according to the Ordinary
Process of Nature. Again, when he finds
fault with the <hi>disproportion</hi> of the Days
Works (as hath been observ'd before, and
as you may see p. 41. <hi>The Time of the Creation
of each body was so disproportionate to the Work
it self as is perfectly irreconcilable to the divine
wisdom of its Creator, and the accounts of the
Works themselves as they are set down by</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.)
It is apparent to every intelligent man
that he proceeds upon the Laws of <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi>
and verily thinks that these were exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observ'd in the making of the World:
which false Notion is one Cause of his False
Hypothesis. We have mean conceptions of
the System of the World if we think it is no
more than a Clock or a Watch. The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
and All-mighty Being doth not confine
himself to <hi>Mechanism</hi> and the Common
Principles of Natural Motion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is vain to undertake to solve all the
Phaenomena's of bodies by them, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
all their effects to the common force
and operation of <hi>Mechanick</hi> Powers, which,
as I apprehend, is the fault of this Learned
<hi>Theorist</hi> and some others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:57877:19"/>
Thus I have briefly touch'd upon the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
and <hi>Grounds</hi> why these persons relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Account of the Creation,
and consequently the System of the World
founded upon it, and why they take <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
or <hi>Cartes</hi> to be better Writers than <hi>Moses.</hi>
In the <hi>First Reason</hi> that they assign they are
Fantastical, and dream of a World of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
in the Moon and the other Planetary
Bodies. In the <hi>Second</hi> they are Childish,
and esteem things by their Bulk and Shew. In
the <hi>Third</hi> they are Sneaking, and debase
themselves, and take no notice of their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Nature. In the <hi>Last</hi> they debase the
All-mighty himself by tying him to Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Laws. And in all four they seem to
discourse unreasonably, unphilosophically,
unscripturally. They fly to precarious Evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Scripture, and give such a fanciful
account of the Inspired Writers words
(which are plain and intelligible of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
that the <hi>Theists,</hi> and some in a Form
above them, cannot but confess themselves
deeply obliged to them. The number of
those that undervalue the Holy Oracles is
great already, and I fear such Treatises as
these incourage them, especially when pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by persons of that Character and Order.
Those of the Sacred Function, above all
others, should be very Cautious lest they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
in this kind. They ought to take care
that they interfere not with the Letter of
Scripture, that they distort not the sense of
the Sacred Text, and prevaricate with the
Book of God; and particularly that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
not the plain History of <hi>Moses,</hi> that they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57877:20"/>
attempt not to run down his Account of the
Creation.</p>
            <p>Our Theorist, I <hi>conceive,</hi> hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
delinquent as to these things, he hath
thrown down <hi>Moses</hi> to erect himself, he hath
made bold with the First Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi>
to introduce and establish his own <hi>Theorems</hi>
and <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> such as These, that the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os
was the Atmosphere of a Comet, that a
Comet pass'd by the Earth at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
<hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and others about the Revolution
of the Earth <hi>not till</hi> Adams Fall, about the
Change of its <hi>Figure,</hi> about <hi>Paradise,</hi> about
the <hi>Abyss,</hi> about the <hi>Planets,</hi> &amp;c. which are
Precarious Notions, and have no solid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in Reason, Nature, or Scripture to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them. All which a<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Nichols</hi>'s Conference with a Theist Part. 1</note> late Writer of a
free and brisk Genius hath thought fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and even to ridicule. But it is not my
business to treat this Gentleman at that rate:
I only observe that he seems to have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Sacred History whilst he is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Account of the Phaenomena of the
Earth.</p>
            <p>But yet this is not said as if I were so
strait-laced as to abridg this Excellent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in any thing of an <hi>Indifferent</hi> nature, or to
debar him of a <hi>Philosophical Freedom,</hi> or to
lay restraint upon him as to any Disquisitions
that are Ingenious, and in the least Probable.
But all this might be done without entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon <hi>Moses.</hi> He might, and ought to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57877:20"/>
have adjusted his Notions to the Text, and
made them comport with <hi>Moses</hi>'s History,
and built thereupon a Rational <hi>Theory,</hi> and a
Scheme of Philosophy consistent with <hi>Genesis.</hi>
But it was his Infelicity to take a Contrary
Method, to usurp upon the Holy Writ,
wantonly to oppose the natural and obvious
meaning of it, to offer such Interpretations
as give occasion to persons to slight the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Volume, and to disregard that sense and
meaning of it which lie plain before
them.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I consider'd the <hi>Mischief</hi> and
<hi>Danger</hi> which might accrue to the world by
that extravagant Liberty which I apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi> had indulg'd himself in: I
consider'd that such daring Flights as these
might prove fatal to <hi>Young Students</hi> in <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy</hi>
and <hi>Divinity,</hi> and teach them to erect
their own Hypotheses upon the ruines of the
Sacred Text: I consider'd how injurious
these Attempts are to the Scriptures in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and how derogatory to the Spirit of
God who indited them: and the sense of this
alone (without any other Inducement what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever)
moved me to use this Plainness and
Freedom with so Worthy and Learned an
Author.</p>

            <head>OF THE
Motion of the Earth.
AN
Answer to some Objections
against some passages in my
late Discourse (entituled
A Demonstration of the
Existence and Providence
of God) relating to the
Copernican Hypothesis of
the diurnal Revolution of
the Earth.</head>
            <p>A Learned Gentleman was lately pleas'd
to do me the honour to frame some
<hi>Objections</hi> against the <hi>Second Chapter</hi> of the
<hi>First Part</hi> of my Treatise, wherein I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57877:21"/>
to evince the Being and Providence
of God from the Works of the Creation.
First, he censures that passage Page 25. <hi>The
Sun measures about a thousand miles in an hour.</hi>
He thinks I have not used the <hi>right method of
calculating the Sun's motion.</hi> I must confess
to him I was not very Studious about that,
being disheartn'd by the great <hi>Difference of
Computations</hi> which I observ'd in the Authors
I met with. It is well known how discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
the Calculations of Astronomers are.
I have seen in my time a good many Writers
on that subject, but I could never light upon
any one that satisfies that Point: wherefore
I chose rather to pitch upon a Common and
Vulgar Computation than to trouble the
Reader with the several Opinions of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers,
or to offer one that might seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.
Herein I conceive I have done
nothing amiss. And truly if the <hi>Objector</hi>
had been Impartial, <hi>i. e.</hi> had consulted one
part of my Discourse as well as the other, he
would not have found any occasion for an
Exception against the foresaid passage. If he
had been pleas'd to take notice of p. 60.
l. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these words would have silenc'd
his Scruples, <hi>As to the motion of them</hi> (viz.
the Planets) there is a great disagreement
among Writers: therefore what hath been said
before as to this, must be submitted to those that
are able to judge of the different Hypotheses.
Here is <hi>submission,</hi> but it is not regarded: here
was a modest acknowledgment of the Author's
insufficiency to give a just and accurate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Motion</hi> of those heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and a Candid and Ingenuous Reader
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57877:22"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:57877:23"/>
could not but infer that the like was supposed
in the Case before us. We are not able to
determine in a matter where there are so Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Sentiments. My design was to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the Reader the All-mighty Power and
Infinite Wisdom of the Supreme Being in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Course of the Celestial Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and especially of the Solar Globe: and
this design I thought sufficiently accomplish'd
by a General Computation of the Suns Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and not by descending to Nice Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which would rather amuse and distract
than give any Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Next, as to what I had offer'd against the
<hi>Motion of the Earth,</hi> he objects that <hi>I have
not dealt fairly with the</hi> Copernicans, <hi>for I
have produced their trifling and less weighty
Reasons, but have conceal'd the strongest.</hi> If
this be so, then I must tell him, that <hi>Kepler</hi>
and <hi>Galilaeo</hi> (Great Names in Astronomy)
were <hi>Triflers,</hi> then <hi>Lansbergius, Varenius,
Gilbert</hi> had no <hi>weight</hi> in their Arguments;
then <hi>Copernicus</hi> himself was a very easy and
mean Arguer, and defended his Post but
slightly. I could mention a Learned Writer
who is now alive, the Worthy Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> one
of whose Arguments for the <hi>Copernican</hi> hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
is<note n="*" place="bottom">The Wisdom of God in the Creation, p. 180.</note> 
               <hi>the vast disproportion in respect of
Magnitude that is between the Earth and the
Heavens, and the great unlikelyhood that such
an infinite number of vast bodies should move
about so inconsiderable a spot as the Earth:</hi> and
this is the Chief Argument he propounds.
And this, with others which I produced,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57877:23"/>
were made use of, and earnestly urged by
other Learned Writers of great Note and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
Now, who would have thought that
the <hi>Modern Copernicans</hi> would confess that the
Arguments which the First Founders of the
Opinion made use of, and which the Chiefest
Writers produc'd to bring men off from the
other perswasion, were so <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling?</hi>
Or if they were Strong Reasons at
first, how came they now, by my exposing
them, to be weak? Or, if the Worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
before mention'd thought fit to insist up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, can any man give any reason why I
might not propound them as the Topicks
made use of for that Cause? It will be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to return a satisfactory Answer to these
Queries. No, saith this Gentleman; for
though those foresaid Philosophers found out,
or retrieved the Earths Circumrotation, yet
we of late found out the <hi>True Reason</hi> of it.
And what is that, I pray? <hi>The true Reason of
this Hypothesis is this, its suitableness to the laws
of Mechanism.</hi> This is the Great <hi>Arcanum</hi>
which our late Worthies boast they have had
the happiness to bless the world with.</p>
            <p>But I desire these two things may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.</p>
            <p>First, this is a Reason which was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> the first Reviver of
this Hypothesis, nor so much as mention'd by
some of the Greatest Followers and Asserters
of his doctrine, as I'm ready to prove out of
the Authors themselves, if it be denied.
Those things which I alledg'd, and which
this Gentleman calls <hi>trifling,</hi> are the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Arguments</hi> which the generality of <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57877:24"/>
urge for their Opinion. They did not
so much as understand the word <hi>Mechanism,</hi>
they had never heard of such a term. <hi>Gassen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
who gives a summary account of all the
Reasons produced for this Hypothesis, reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
up those very ones which I gather'd out of
the Authors themselves: only he argues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
from the Motion of the Planets, which
is uncertain and dubious; but he hath not a
syllable about <hi>the laws of Mechanism.</hi> Tell
me then, is it credible that the First Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Establishers of an Hypothesis should
not be acquainted with the <hi>True Reason</hi> why
they threw off the receiv'd Opinion, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
another?</p>
            <p>Secondly, They that at this day use these
Terms know not how to apply them to the
present purpose. I deny not the Excellent
Use and Advantage of the <hi>Mechanick</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
(of which I have spoken in another
place) for most of the Great and Brave Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of this Age in <hi>Physiology, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicks,</hi>
&amp;c. are owing to this: but that which
I assert at present is, that it is no ways applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the matter in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of the <hi>Copernicans:</hi> for there is not one of
them, so far as I can judg, that hath solidly
shew'd and prov'd the agreeableness of the
Earths Circumgyration to the <hi>Laws of Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism.</hi>
There is a late Writer that talks as
much of the <hi>Mechanical</hi> Laws of Motion as
any man, but though he asserts the Diurnal
Circumvolution of the Earth, yet<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi>'s New Theory, Book 1 and 2.</note> he holds
that in the time of Mans Innocence there was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57877:24"/>
no such thing, but that it was the effect of
Man's Fall, and immediately follow'd upon
the <hi>Curse</hi> on the Earth, and is part of its
<hi>Curse.</hi> Whence it follows that the Earths
Motion was not the <hi>Primitive</hi> state and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of it; it was not <hi>Natural</hi> to it, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural,
inordinate and irregular, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
not according to the stated laws of
<hi>Mechanism.</hi> And as for the Other Authors
who endeavour to solve the Earths Motion in
a <hi>Mechanical</hi> way, it is evident that they are
not able to effect what they have undertaken.
And how indeed can we expect they should
do it, when we find them disagreeing about
the <hi>Mechanick Laws?</hi> There never was a
greater dissen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion among Natural Pilosophers
than there is about this one thing, as appears
from comparing the Writings of <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
(who was the First Substantial Author of
<hi>Mechanism)</hi> Dr. <hi>More,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Newton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whiston,</hi> and
other Philosophical Men of this age, who
have built their respective and different Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses
and Theories on their different notions
of <hi>Mechanick</hi> Principles and Agents. They
<hi>all</hi> pretend to proceed upon <hi>Mechanical</hi>
Laws: their Solutions are founded on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Tendency of Matter: and yet we see
how wide their Notions are from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and how their Hypotheses are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to each other. Which plainly shews
how fallacious an Argument <hi>Mechanism</hi> is.
And if we speak <hi>particularly</hi> of the matter now
before us, who sees not how differently these
Principles and Laws are applied? Some Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
(as this present <hi>Objector</hi> himself acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57877:25"/>
making out the <hi>Copernican</hi> Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
by the notion of <hi>Vortices,</hi> others by that of
Mutual <hi>Gravitation</hi> about a Common Center.</p>
            <p>First, some think the Motion of the Earth
demonstrable from the <hi>Vortices.</hi> So the Great
<hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and the famous Dr. <hi>More</hi> in one
of his <hi>Epistles;</hi> and there are others that es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouse
this part of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Physicks. But
it were easie to shew how improbable an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
this is on several accounts: for it puts
a Force upon Nature, because according to
<hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s own Principle all bodies moving
Circularly endeavour to get free of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to alter the Center: so that there is
nothing like <hi>Natural Motion</hi> in the hypothesis
of <hi>Vortices,</hi> but all is Violent, and against the
easie known laws of <hi>Mechanism.</hi> The <hi>Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
are impetuous Torrents of fluid matter
continually emptying and discharging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
the <hi>Poles</hi> of every one of them are
made forcible Dreiners for the <hi>Eclipticks,</hi> and
there is a constant disgorging and evacuating
of such and such a Set of Particles, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
always with a violent emission, impulse,
and protrusion. So that without <hi>Revelation</hi>
we may tell that there is <hi>War in heaven,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
justing and tilting, jarring and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Among the <hi>Vortical</hi> Orbs, Celestial
and Planetary, there are Commotions and
Tumults, and the World is in a Continual
Hurly-burly, a Pell-mell, a Confusion.
That the <hi>Vortices</hi> keep their Station, and are
not swallow'd up of one another is a Miracle.
One would think that it is impossible but that
they should encroach upon one another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of that violent and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57877:25"/>
motion which the Author of them hath
described. The truth is, no considerate and
thoughtful man can apprehend how the
World hath been able to subsist so long as it
hath, on the supposition of that make and
composition of the <hi>Vortices</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, it might be proved that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Vortices</hi> destroys the common notion
of <hi>Gravity, i. e.</hi> the descent of heavy bodies
to the Center, that it must necessarily hinder
the Sun and Stars from being seen, that it is
utterly inconsistent with the Steadiness of their
motions, and the certainty of their Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that it is irreconcileable with the Flux
and Reflux of the Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This and much
more may be made good concerning the <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices;</hi>
which renders <hi>Des Cartes</hi>'s <hi>System</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Excellent Author himself
thought it to be no other: in his <hi>Philosophical
Principles,</hi> part 3. Sect. 45. and in two or
three other places of his Writings (as those
that are acquainted with them know very
well) he confesses it to be but a bare <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
he lets us know that he took the liberty
to feign and invent this. And indeed any
man of castigate thoughts can't but perceive
that it is a mere <hi>Romantick</hi> strain that this
<hi>Earth</hi> of ours was once a <hi>Sun,</hi> and that <hi>all the
World was Heavens</hi> at first. This is Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Fine, but not Solid. The World
of <hi>Whirl-pools</hi> is a World of <hi>Monsieur Des
Cartes</hi>'s own making. He intended it only
for a <hi>Philosophical Expedient,</hi> which might
serve to give an account of the Phaenomena in
the Heavens and the Earth: but it is all Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57877:26"/>
and you can't build a Body of Natural
Philosophy upon it, nay you can't evince the
<hi>Earth's Motion</hi> (which is the thing contended
for) from this supposal. Hence it is that some
Great Philosophers of this Age labour to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
this doctrine on another Hypothesis:
which they would not do if they thought the
<hi>laws of Mechanism</hi> as grounded on the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Vortices,</hi> were true and solid. They
would acquiesce in this, and not look out for
some other way to give a Solution of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem:
but we see they are dissatisfied, and
fly to some other way of solving this doctrine
of theirs.</p>
            <p>Secondly then, it <hi>Vortices</hi> cannot do it, <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi>
must. This is another Principle of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism</hi>
that is relied upon. The Chief Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of late that manages this is the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Profound <hi>Mr. Newton,</hi> who in his
<hi>Princip. Philos. Math.</hi> tells us that there is Rest
in the Common Center of Gravity, and if the
Sun be the Center then it rests, and the Earth
moves about it. But first, who is there that,
weighing the several Systems of the World,
(the <hi>Ptolemaick, Tychonick,</hi> &amp;c.) sees not how
difficult it is to determine what part of the
Universe is its <hi>Center?</hi> They Learned <hi>Brahe</hi>
thought the spoke and argued like a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician
and Astronomer when he defended the
<hi>Earths Gentreity.</hi> Again, Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> himself
seems not to hold that the Sun is the Center of
the Mundane System: nay he owns expresly
in his <hi>10th Proposit.</hi> the distance of the Solar
body from the Center of Gravity, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
it self, and all the Planetary bodies,
with the Earth. Besides, this Mechanical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57877:26"/>
which is stiled <hi>Vis Gentripeta,</hi> or <hi>Gravity,</hi>
is very obscure and doubtful, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfactory,
because of the Different (if not
contrary) hypotheses it is built upon, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Various apprehensions of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
heads. From the discrepancy of their
notions, and their ways of solving this Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon
we are able to gather only this, that
the Problem of <hi>Gravitation</hi> or <hi>Non-gravitation,</hi>
and the suppositions and solutions about it have
puzzled the Wits of the profoundest Vertuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so's,
and consequently we have no Sure foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here.</p>
            <p>Further, the Laws of <hi>Gravity</hi> can scarcely
be said to be <hi>Mechanical:</hi> for <hi>Gravitation</hi> is
not a Mechanick Principle, because it flows
not from the Nature of Bodies, they being in
themselves of a Passive nature, and therefore
cannot tend towards other Bodies, or draw
them to them. There is no such Activity in
mere Corporeal and Material Beings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the laws of the Universal Tendency
or Attraction of Matter, which are supposed,
must have another Spring. Dr. <hi>More</hi> in his
<hi>Metaphysicks</hi> will let you know that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from an Higher Principle, that they can't
be solv'd in a mere Mechanical way, that they
are above and beyond all the force of Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,
and depend wholly and entirely on the
Divine Omnipotent Mover. But then you
will say, the Gravity of bodies is a <hi>Miracle:</hi>
for the notion we have of a <hi>Miracle</hi> is, that it is
some Occurrence which is above or contrary
to the fix'd course of Nature. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
tho' it is true the main and chief thing
which constitutes a <hi>Miracle,</hi> is that is surpasses
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57877:27"/>
finite power, and is the result of an Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Agent, yet there are other Properties
which must concur to denominate a <hi>Miracle,</hi>
as <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Wonder;</hi> but these two are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here, for <hi>Gravity,</hi> and the Effects of it are
common and usual, and (as the consequent of
that) beget not Admiration and Amazement,
and for these reasons we stile them not <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</hi>
But notwithstanding this, we may hold
that they are things that exceed the power of
mere Nature, they are not from the efficicien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Matter, in what manner soever moved,
but are immediately from a Divine hand. <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,</hi>
saith a late<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Whiston</hi>'s New Theory, book 1. p. 6.</note> Learned Writer, <hi>is above,
besides and contrary to the nature of Matter, and
is the effect of a Divine Power and Efficacy which
governs the whole world;</hi> nay, he sticks not to
say, <hi>of<note n="†" place="bottom">Book 4. chap. 1.</note> a Supernatural and Miraculous Influence.</hi>
And an<note n="‡" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Bentley,</hi> Serm. 7.</note> other Ingenious Gentleman speaks to
the same purpose.</p>
            <p>Lastly, as to <hi>Mechanism</hi> it self, the laws and
rules of it are very disputable, and therefore
we can't solidly argue from it. The Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Cartesians</hi> (that Great and Mighty Genius
of Mechanism, whom all the Learned World
admires and applauds) proceeds upon and
proves all by <hi>Mechanick</hi> Principles in his Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Celestial and Terrestrial Bodies, but
yet we find that several of his Principles and
Maxims have been rejected since by very Wise
heads, and great Judges in Mathematicks. Let
One speak for all,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Ray</hi>'s Wisdom of God in the Creation, p. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Des Cartes's Rules,</hi> saith he,
<hi>concerning the transferring of motion from one body
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57877:27"/>
in motion to another in motion or in rest, are the
most of them by Experience found to be false, as
they affirm who have made Trial of them.</hi> Here
then is no Certainty, there is no proceeding
on <hi>Mechanical</hi> Laws in the present Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy:
which was the thing to be proved.</p>
            <p>This is what I had briefly to suggest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Two Mechanick Principles</hi> which
the Learned <hi>Objector</hi> founds the <hi>Motion of the
Earth</hi> upon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And now I appeal to himself
whether he can alledg these as a <hi>grand</hi> and
<hi>weighty reason</hi> (as he expresses it) of the
Phaenomenon he defends, seeing they are so
Uncertain and fickle, seeing Naturalists so
widely differ about them, and can't agree in
assigning the <hi>Mechanism.</hi> Any rational man
will infer hence that we can not rely upon
this doctrine in the present Case. This I
think is very clear and plain, and therefore
let not the <hi>grand</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi> reason of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canism</hi>
be brought to prove the <hi>Circular motion
of the Earth,</hi> till there be an agreement about
the <hi>Nature</hi> of it. Though Dr. <hi>More</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> (who are the worthy persons
our <hi>Objector</hi> cites) make the Motion of the
Earth the necessary effects of <hi>Mechanism,</hi>
yet they do it upon <hi>different</hi> grounds, they
proceed on Mechanick laws of Motion which
are <hi>diverse</hi> from one an other, and depend
on different Hypotheses; therefore a third
person cannot build upon either of them.
How can a man found the Earths Circulation
on <hi>Vortices</hi> or <hi>Gravity,</hi> when the Authors
and Founders themselves prove it not from
the same Mechanical Principles, but such as
contradict each other? for such are <hi>Gravity</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:57877:28"/>
or the subsiding of bodies, and the <hi>Whirling
them round.</hi> If we had a mind to make use
of these Hypotheses of those Great Men,
we can't (if we would) adhere to <hi>both</hi> of
them, because they so vastly differ; therefore
<hi>One</hi> of them only can be pitch'd upon, but
<hi>which</hi> of them is hard to determine, and this
Gentleman himself doth not assign which of
them he intends to own as the True Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
            <p>If you stick to the <hi>Vortices,</hi> you will be
liable to the <hi>Witty Atheist</hi> you mention, for
the <hi>Vortices</hi> are look'd upon by the Judicious
as only an Ingenuous Invention. If you rely
upon the <hi>Principles</hi> of that other Worthy
Gentleman you quote, he will fail you as
to any thing that looks like <hi>Demonstration,</hi>
for he is oblig'd first to prove and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
his supposed notion of <hi>Gravity,</hi> and
the <hi>Cause</hi> of it (wherein he differs from very
Great Philosphers and Vertuoso's) before
he can maintain that Point. And I need
not tell you that if <hi>his Principles</hi> be question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
then <hi>your Inferences</hi> from them (which
are the Main of your Argument) must be so too.
You proceed upon some Suppositions which
that Excellent Person hath espoused, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
himself to a Particular way of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophizing
which most pleases him: but unless
you can absolutely prove that what he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
concerning the nature of <hi>Gravity</hi> is
certainly True, in my opinion you effect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
I mean nothing that is certain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable:
for otherwise I grant that you
have most elaborately established the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonian
Hypothesis,</hi> and the <hi>Earths Motion</hi> on
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57877:28"/>
that foot: but if that foot be infirm, as I
conceive it is, then all your Arguing is of that
nature also and you still want a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to
move this Globe. The short of all is, if you
strike in with <hi>Cartes</hi> and <hi>More,</hi> you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the <hi>Lucasian</hi> Professor: if you make
choice of this last, you must cashier the other
two.</p>
            <p>Where then is this <hi>Demonstration</hi> of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernican</hi>
hypothesis from <hi>Mechanical</hi> Principles
which is talk'd of? I grant what this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
saith, that <hi>upon supposition of Vortices the
motion of the Earth is proved as fully agreeable
to Mechanism as a Boats swiming down the
stream, if left at liberty:</hi> but then it must
be prov'd that there is this <hi>Stream</hi> in the
make of the Earth and of the Heavenly
Bodies too, which he attempts not to prove.
And as for <hi>Gravitation,</hi> as it is represented
by that Celebrated <hi>Mathematician</hi> he quotes,
and the laws of <hi>Mechanism</hi> consequent upon
that, which he infers from the <hi>dimensions of
the Planetary System,</hi> I need not inform him
(he being so well acquainted with it) that
there hath been, and is at this day a great
a disagreement among the Learnedest Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers
about the distance of the Planets
from the Earth, and from one an other;
there have been profess'd Disputes and
Quarels about this, and accordingly there
must be a dissention about the <hi>Dimensions</hi> of
those bodies: and consequently if their
Calculations be various, there is no Arguing
from thence; we can't judg of the <hi>Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism
of the Plannets</hi> because we are strangers
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57877:29"/>
to their just <hi>Dimensions,</hi> and the laws of their
<hi>Motion</hi> depending thereupon.</p>
            <p>When I consider'd these things, when I
observed how obscure, uncertain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious
the Principles are on which the <hi>Earths
Motion</hi> is grounded, I thought it best (in
my Discourse of the <hi>Existence and Providence
of God)</hi> to lay aside this New Hypothesis.
Because I was not well satisfied with the
Account which the Moderns give of it, I
chose rather to retain the <hi>Tychonick System,</hi> as
being least incumber'd with Objections and
Difficulties. Of which an Intelligent Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
of this Age (whom I mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
was sensible, and therefore declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
no Stickler for the <hi>Copernican</hi> Hypothesis,
but very fairly and ingenuously professes that
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mr. Rays</hi> Wisdom of the Creation, p. 183.</note>
               <hi>he doth not positively assert it, but only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
it as an Hypothesis not altogether improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
But as to what I have offer'd, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist</hi>
(be he as <hi>Witty</hi> as this Gentleman can
make him) hath no advantage by it, (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he seems to suggest:) nay rather, it
would have made for him if I had founded
the <hi>Providence</hi> of the Almighty on so totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a basis as the <hi>laws of Mechanism.</hi> The Cause
would have receiv'd a great prejudice from
the using of an Argument so weak and dubious.
Then it would have been disputed, whether the
Penman of the Book of <hi>Genesis</hi> or Monsieur
<hi>Cartes,</hi> or whether he or Mr. <hi>Newton</hi> were the
better Author: or rather it would have been
plainly seen that there is a greater deference
given by some men to the latter then to the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57877:29"/>
former, and that the Philosophical Principles
of the one are prefer'd to the Inspired
Writings of the other.</p>
            <p>But the Truth of the matter is this, the
Merits of that Cause I undertook, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Proof of the Divine Providence,</hi> were not
concern'd in this Controversy, For whether
one or the other hypothesis <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Rest</hi> or
the <hi>Motion</hi> of the Earth) be true is not materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
as to the Main Business: and so much I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
in that Discourse, p. 57. l. 7. &amp;c.
<hi>After all, if the Copernican hypothesis should be
true, that is, if the Earth rolls about on its
Center, and so turns it self to the Sun in its
various positions, yet still there are the same Effects
of this that there were of the other Revolution,
viz. that of the Sun; the good and benefit of
mankind are promoted, and the Power and
Goodness of the Great Benefactor are declared.</hi>
And I had said before, p. 49. <hi>The motion of
the Earth is a precarious Opinion, so far as
I have hitherto discerned.</hi> By which words
I shut not out future Convictions, and I let
the World see that I am not Peremptory in my
determination, but that I believe the Power
and Wisdom of God may be evidenc'd from
both hypotheses. Yet it was and is my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
that the doctrine of the <hi>Earths Rest</hi>
is more probable and accountable then that
of its <hi>Moving:</hi> there is more to be said for
its standing Still then for its taking a Turn
about the Sun. At least I shall continue in
this Opinion till the Writers who are of
the other side agree upon a better way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
and proving what they assert. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi>
was modest who demanded a Place
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57877:30"/>
to set his foot on, an to plant his Engines,
and then he would undertake to move the
Earth: but some of the Gentlemen of the
<hi>Copernican</hi> way pretend to do this without
any solid <hi>Footing,</hi> and without any <hi>Machins</hi>
but those of their own Ingenious Brains, which
it must be confessed are very strong and
powerful, but not powerful enough to effect
this Business they Undertake. I hope then
I may without of<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ence retain my Perswasion,
till I see it confuted by Solid Arguments,
and such as as are founded upon unshaken Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
Seeing this Learned <hi>Objector,</hi> who
is of so deep a Comprehension, is not pleas'd
to produce such, I am apt to think that none
else can.</p>
            <p>I only observe in the last place, that he
is for a Neutrality, and would have me
<hi>treat both hypotheses with indifferency:</hi> but
he sets me a Task which he is not willing to
perform himself, for he hath shew'd himself
in what he writes to be a great favourer of
the <hi>Copernicans,</hi> in direct Opposition to the
other side. We can prescribe that to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which we take no care to observe
our selves.</p>
