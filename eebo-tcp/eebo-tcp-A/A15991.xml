         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That this glorious Lampe of <hi>Israel</hi> for a season was darkned by Idolatrie, his historie expresseth: yea his historie being shut vp with the mention of that euil <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Bellarm. de verbo Dei lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> Romanistes conclude, that <hi>Salomon</hi> died vnrepentant, and so by consequent, an Abiect. But seeing other scripture will necessarily conuince that, they should rather think, that his history was shut vp obscurely, that so therein he might shadowe forth our Iesus, who in his death also was numbred amidst transgressors, making his graue so with the wicked. That he died not an abiect, these reasons euince.</p>
                  <p>First, the consideration of his Tipeship: for seeing God se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected him for the sole figure of Messiahs loue, spirituall peace, and plentie towardes his spousesse the Church: it shal be more then rash ignorance to conclude him an Abiect.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Sa. 7.14, 15.</note> the promise which God makes to <hi>Dauid</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if his son <hi>Salomon</hi> should sinne, hee would chasten him with the rod of man, but not take his mercy from him as he did from <hi>Saul</hi>) it concludeth repentance: seeing chastenings with mercy are (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.) signes of children (not bastards) and the meanes to bring them to repentance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he was not a Prophet, sent in mercy to the church,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16829:11"/>
but an holy Prophet and Scribe of the Holy-ghost. Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in his 2. Epistle 1. Chap. verse 20.21. so speaketh of all these holy Teachers: <hi>First know this, that no Prophecie in the scripture is of any priuate motion: for the prophecie came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God</hi> (a terme neuer giuen to the reprobate) <hi>they spake as they were moued by the holy-ghost.</hi> Now <hi>Salomon</hi> being one of these <hi>Holy men of God,</hi> hee must needes depart hence in the state of grace.</p>

                        </gap>17</note>Fourtthly, the Holy ghost commending <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and his people for their first three yeeres gouernment, saying: <hi>Three yeres long they walked in the way of Dauid and Salomon,</hi> it plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vrgeth that <hi>Salomon</hi> died in Gods fauour, or else he should neuer so haue bene coupled with <hi>Dauid</hi> his father.

                  <p>Lastly, his owne three books euince his repentance: first the booke of Prouerbs specially the Preface lying in the first nine chapters: wherein he specially admonisheth his people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the strange woman: vrging the sea of iniquity (bodily and spirituall) which accompanieth that euill, as speaking from experience. In which booke he laboreth therfore to settle his Puple (of what degre or calling soeuer) in the rudiments and grounds of religion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, his booke termed Preacher, wherein (specially in Cha. 2.) he preacheth worldly vanitie f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In which booke he taketh his disciple (as into an hie mountaine) that so from thence looking downe-warde, hee may spie the flitting and vanishing estate of all things here vnder the Sunne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this most diuine Song penned (as before is prooued) in his olde age: vaine lustes then turned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue loues passing betwene Messiah and his Church.</p>
                  <p>(As if heerein hee hadde lifted his Hearer higher then the Sunne, for speculating matters solely celestiall) it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prooueth the veritie of his repentance. Left hee was for

                  <p>And I take, bicause that none should compare it only with his owne Songs, nor yet onely with the other Songs of the

                  <p>Her prayer lying in the first clause, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth her seruent desire after <hi>Messiahs</hi> presence: wherin I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, first, the forme of her petition, secondly, the matter shee doeth petitionate. The forme is <hi>Imperatiue,</hi> or <hi>Optatiue.</hi> If Imperatiue, then she speaketh to some Riuals of her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, commaunding them to let her beloued come vnto her:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16829:12"/>
If Optatiue (which I rather incline to) then she offers vp pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Prayer: and this must bee, either to <hi>Messiah</hi> himselfe (which I lesse conceiue) or vnto his Father (wherein I rather rest) seeing the Father is said <note place="margin">Galat. 4.4</note> to send him foorth after the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of time, and he the Sonne meane time <note place="margin">Iohn 1.18 compared with cha. 17.5</note> in the glorious bosome of the Father.

                  <p>The faithfull in holy Scripture doe pray for Christes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, but in a twofold sense, respecting two sundry times. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation, they desire his appearance in our flesh, for killing sinne in our flesh, and so quickning it to vnfained san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie: after his appearance they doe with <hi>Iohn</hi> desire he may come quickly, namely in his glory, for the glorification of his Saints: and for this appeerance do <hi>the soules vnder the Altare thirst and hunger.</hi> But in this place, is specially and properly intended, the churches feruent desire for his appearance in the flesh: which vnion of his diuine nature, with our humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I take to be signified (at least, in part) by the terme <hi>Kisse.</hi> And principally also, I here vnderstand (as before) the chosen of the Nations, desiring after vnion with him, as no doubt the Gentile Queene, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter had no slender affection
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16829:13"/>
after communion with <hi>Salomon,</hi> the glorious tipe of our Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</p>
                  <p>A kisse <hi>vnfained</hi> (such a Kisse as the Apostle calleth Holie, and wherewith the Saints did sometimes salute one another) it is as a sacrament of Soules vnitie and onenesse, such as was in <hi>Ierushalems</hi> church, touching which it is affirmed, that al were of one accord in the Lord. But here the terme is in the second place plural (<hi>Kisses</hi>) as therby intimating (besides other things) an vnion of <hi>Messiah</hi> with her in soule and body, sense, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and all actiue powers, a full vnion of God and Man. This she desireth, and feruently desireth: and this in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time he fully performeth.

                  <p>Touching the reason of her Petition, <hi>For thy loue is</hi> (or, Loues are good) <hi>and better than wine,</hi> it is as if she saide: <hi>O heauenly Father, I haue prayed that thou wouldst send thy Sonne to his poore Church, that he might vnite himselfe corporallie with her (the Godhead inhabiting the Manhoode essentially) Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this my petition, vouchsafe I may debate the matter with my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.</hi> Then by an Apostrophe she turneth aside, and after such sort reasons with him: Sweete Messiah, <hi>Shiloh Zecharies</hi> Branch, and <hi>Iaa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>obs</hi> Starre: I long after thy presence: yea, thou hast set my soule on fire after thee: for thy Loues are beauteous and farre more effectuall then wine. Beauties there are many, but all inferiour to thine. There is pleasure and strength in wine: but thy loue and pleasant amours doe more inflame and rauish the senses. O heauenly Father, if I be bold, thy Sonnes loue hath constrained me; oh glorious Messiah, if I call for thee, thy Fathers promise in Paradice, it causeth mee: and the beginnings of Loue which by thy spirite thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me feeling of, as wine in the first taste they comfort mee: as wine in the second place they delight mee: as wine in the third place they embolden mee: as wine in the last place they cause mee bee ready to fall in a Loue-trance. Oh therefore come speedily and embrace me, and by the spirit of thy mouth ouershadowe the Virgin, and make vs members of thy bodie,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16829:13"/>
of thy flesh, and of thy bones.</p>
                  <p>Besides other ordinary notes, I obserue hence, first howe Time in Paradise (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.) conceiued of the promised seed: that time grew (as it were) more big-bellied in the renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the promise to <hi>Abraham, Dauid</hi> and others: and that in the fulnesse of time, <hi>That blessed seed</hi> was to be brought foorth for the exceeding comfort of mankind. The faithfull concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this doctrine, they are therefore here introduced, sighing after the performance of the promise. If they but tasting the promise, and seeing it but a farre off (for the time of this Songs penning was about 900. years before <hi>Shiloh</hi> came) how ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and earnest shoulde our affections bee in the possession thereof? The taste and possession of wines are of more value, than the bare sight and taste thereof: and such should our loue be in the reall enioying of Messiah. Examine therfore we our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues, and looke into our soules, for if Christ Iesus liue in vs, we cannot but with feruencie embrace him and loue all the fruits of his spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, her manner of speach, [<hi>Kisse me, &amp;c.</hi>] it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the meanes wherby the Virgin should conceiue, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>spirit of Christ</hi> ouershadowing her: that spirit being as <hi>Agent</hi> to her seede <hi>Patient.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. <hi>rúach</hi> Gr. <hi>pneuma.</hi> Lat. <hi>Spiritus</hi>
                     </note> Spirit and Breath is one and the same (both in Hebrewe, Greeke, and Latine) which is cause, that sometimes our men in the Prophets do turne it, <hi>by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his mouth,</hi> otherwhiles, <hi>by the breath of his mouth, &amp;c.</hi> This Conception and Generation is so exempted from that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry encreasement of mankinde. And therefore, though <hi>Leui</hi> payed tithes in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes, to <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> and all wee haue sinned in the loynes of <hi>Adam</hi>: yet this second <hi>Adam</hi> can be said to do neither. Woman sinned first, but no speech of spirituall nakednesse, till Man also sinned: <hi>Then</hi> (it is sayde) <hi>their eyes were opened and they saw themselues naked</hi>: as if sinne were imperfect and vnable to bring forth death on the seed of their loynes, till Man (in whome lay the Actiue power of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration) he had sinned. Though blessed <hi>Mary</hi> sinned, and had sinne in her nature, yet it could act nothing to Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:16829:14"/>As all Naturians will graunt womans seede onely passiue, (and for because not Actiue, some haue concluded women to be seedelesse) so neyther is sinne any creature, or anie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but an action transgressing, causing God his curse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mankinde by mortalitie and corruption. And because the Virgins seede patient, was by the spirit of God quickened (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the clayish nature of man viuified by the breathing of god) hir betrothed <hi>Ioseph</hi> is taught by <hi>Gabriel,</hi> how that <note place="margin">Matth. 1.20</note> 
                     <hi>which was conceiued in her, it was of the holy spirit.</hi> This one doctrine so ouerturneth the doctrine and obiections of our ages Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists. Who thinke of sinne as of a <hi>Substance</hi>: it being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an <hi>Accident,</hi> and seuered in Christs conception, by the Actiue power of the <hi>holy-ghost.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, by speech [<hi>Kisses of his mouth</hi>] is further (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in a second sense) intimated the operation of God his word and spirit for incorporating vs into Christ. By his word, the Worlde was created, and by the breath of his mouth the foundation thereof was laide.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ng that word in the wombe of their conscience: for by the ministry of his word &amp; sacraments he kisseth his creature, breathing (by that his ordinance) his owne good spirit into them. And because no hereticall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine can do this, the Church (in her prayer) desireth the kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>His mouth</hi> to whome shee prayeth. Nay, for her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ticall doctrine, it is so farre from effecting a new world in vs, as it is (indeed) the seede of the serpent, wherby he begets a damned body of infidels and false beleeuers to himselfe.</p>
                  <p>For the reason of her prayer in this verse, wherby she wold insinuate her petition into the Lord his cares, as crauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Promise,</hi> and that whereof shee had a pleasant fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taste, to the kindling in her such praier: besides other things, I note these:</p>
                  <p>First, that the sauing <hi>promises</hi> of God (who in Christ are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi>) they are with all holy boldnesse to hee called
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16829:14"/>
for. For as he is faithfull that hath promised, so he expects we pray for the speedy performance thereof: seeing the promises are the churches life and glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, her speech [<hi>Thy loues</hi>] it argueth the loue of God in Christ to be infinite and of a growing nature <hi>Election</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all time, begetteth an effectuall <hi>Vocation</hi> in time: that <hi>Vocation</hi> brings with it, in the one hand, assurance of <hi>Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in the other hand, reall <hi>Sanctification.</hi> These beget other diuine Loues: causing in vs a fountaine springing vp vnto <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life.</hi> If the church in her pedagogie and non-age could haue such deepe feeling of diuine Loues, what should we feele, who are come to inherit that Canaan?<note place="margin">Ephes. 3.14, 15 16, 17.18.</note> We should be able (as the Apostle prayeth) to comprehend with all Saintes, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height of the Fathers Loue in Christ Iesus. If Marchants finding a Commoditie sweete, they sue for more: let vs in the least sense of God his loue pray for more; seeing this is a commoditie of eternall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Church expressing her feeling of Christs loue, to be vnto her more excellent and efficatious then wine (wine being that which <hi>delighteth the heart of man</hi>) wee thereby are taught, that euery member of this mysticall body, doeth not onely liue to Christ, but also die to the world and the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof. The loue of God in the vse of his word, which is one principall particular of his loue, it was vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> more sweete, <note place="margin">Psal. 19.10.</note>then the hony and hony-combe: and of more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation then tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the loue of God in Christ, it was of such value vnto the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> as (in comparison thereof) he counteth Tribe, Birth, and al tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie and naturall things, but drosse and dung. Howe the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martires, and Confessors haue deemed Christs loue, their continuall sufferings and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vndergoings of the crosse for his sake, they plainely doe witnesse. <hi>Balaam, Iudas Iscariot, Demas,</hi> and many in this age (sauouring earth, not spirit) they are by this doctrine laide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for such as are not of the Church, howsoeuer within the church: for al these Moonish fleeting temporaries, the church

The counterfait whereof none other (vpon paine of death) might make: nor (vppon like penalty) might any other person annoynt his flesh with this ointment, nor perfume himselfe with this composition: for the one and the other were set apart from common vse and so dedicate to a sacred ecclesiasticall purpose. All which, let vs draw into some particular information and profit.</p>
                  <p>First, in that the Church seeketh out the most excellent ointment and perfume for declaration of Messiahs sweete name, it teacheth vs: that all excellent things in nature, they are but as tipes and shadowes of spirituall graces: not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the <hi>Cabalists</hi> position, which concludeth all inferiour things to be but shapes of superiour things: and the patterne

Besides, seeing the former sacred oile (a figure of the spirit sanctifying) it was onely with profite applied to the Priest and his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle: it putteth vs in minde, how Christ and his members on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can haue this spirit, in the worke of sanctification. Nor can any haue receiued this reall sanctification in any true measure, but it is vnto them a reall pledge of eternall saluation: and a demonstration of their holy Election before all worlds, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.3. &amp;c.

For howsoeuer in Christ is the <hi>Sanctum-sanctorum</hi> Holy-of-holies, yet in euery of his members is a <hi>Sanctum</hi> or sanctified conscience. Lastly, whereas the like pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie hanged ouer his head that should counterfet that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oile, it putteth vs in minde, what fearefull iudgement hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ouer the heads of counterfet hypocrites and heretikes, who by painted doctrine and sheepish conuersation doe make outward shewes of the spirit, and holinesse, but in very deede are hollow hearted, and destitute of the power of true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

If this be true in the regenerate, in whom there is some holy thing: how much more in the vnregenerate, who yet is voide of all true holinesse? Secondly, from her forme of praier, [<hi>Draw me,</hi>] she would teach, that the faithful see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues plunged in some sinne (as in a pit) out of which they cannot depart without Christ his Spirit draw them.

                  <p>For the better vnderstanding hereof, it is to be remembred, that the soule of <hi>Man</hi> is distinguished into three faculties, which for learning sake (otherwise a simple essence or substance admits no parts) may be termed 3. partes. The first is termed <hi>Minde,</hi> vnder which are contained all the interiour senses; as <hi>Imagination, Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, &amp;c.</hi> and this is seated properly in the bodies head. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is termed <hi>Will,</hi> vnder the which is contained the affections single and mixt; as <hi>Loue, Hatred, Zeale, &amp;c.</hi> And this is seated
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16829:23"/>
properly in the hart. From both these proceed an actiue power, or working property; which we terme mind &amp; wils <hi>Agent,</hi> or <hi>Factor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church in this her protestation beginneth with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Facultie</hi> (namely <hi>Will</hi>) when as she saith <hi>Wee will reioyce &amp;c.</hi> euen as the holy-ghost in the Prophets (as also the Apostle in bid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Ephesians</hi> put on <hi>Righteousnes &amp; true Holines</hi>) do place the duties of the second <hi>Table,</hi> before them of the first. As it is an easier thing to find <hi>Religion,</hi> without fruits of righteousnes, faith without works: so is it an easier thing to find the <hi>mind</hi> illuminated, then the <hi>wil</hi> sanctified to <hi>Do</hi> according to the minds light. For this cause she begins with the <hi>wil,</hi> and signifies how her affections stand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted to her beloued, saying, <hi>Wee will exult and reioyce in thee:</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by teaching vs, first, to preferre sanctification before illumination; because illumination may be without sanctification (as in <hi>Balaam, Iudas Iscariot &amp;c</hi>) but Sanctification not without illumination: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none are realy sanctified (for we must distinguish betwixt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines <hi>real</hi> and that which is but by <hi>imputation</hi>) but so soone at least their mindes are lightned with the Gospel of Christ Iesus; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are hereby taught, to dedicate all our affections (<hi>Loue, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, Zeale, &amp;c.</hi>) vnto the glorie of our Beloued, euen vnto him that bringeth vs to his House-threshold, yea into his Cellers, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries and chambers of secret presence. And as other affections, so specially our mery and reioycing affections. This the Apostle remembreth saying, <hi>Reioice in the Lord alway, and againe I say, reioice, Philip</hi> 4.4.

                  <p>Wel; If we turne our reioycements from Messiah, his <hi>Euangell</hi> and sweete word will turne from vs. If wee will reioice and be glad in him, he will neuer loathe vs. But seeing our reioycement in euill encreaseth, and our exultation in the wayes of Messiah de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, I know not what to expect, but that the Lord by some notable iudgement should declare to all nations, he loathes vs as much as euer he loued vs.</p>
                  <p>Touching the next clause [<hi>we wil remember thy Loues more than wine</hi>] the faithfull of the Church declare therein, that as the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, so the Senses are consecrated to <hi>Iesus,</hi> yea more consecrate to his loue, then vnto wine that delighter of Nature: as if shee should say, Looke how the Mind of a wordling is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member wine (or any delight of this body) euen so, and much more then so will we remember thy loues. From whence we are taught, first, to dedicate all our senses. (more specially the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie</hi>) for excogitating and recordating the Loue of Christ Iesus. His Loue, yea his Loues that is, his particular Loues, not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any of them vnto Obliuion. As for example, we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he hath, First, giuen vs <hi>Being of no being:</hi> Secondly, created vs reasonable creatures: Thirdly, giuen vs to be borne vnder the light of the Gospel: Fourthly, giuen vs many giftes of Nature beyond some others: fiftly, called vs, sanctified vs, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs of a better state. Not one particular loue but we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, for whetting vp our loues againe towards him, who first loued vs. As the recordating of oile, wheate, wine, is not only so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latious to the Merchant, but also causeth him to labour thereafter: so would the remembrance of God his seueral loues stirre vs vp with <hi>Dauid</hi> much more to delight. <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.6. and to labour the more for possessing thereof; as the worldling for the enioyment of gold and siluer, <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.3.4.5. But alas, wee receiue manie loues, and forget them all: from which ariseth our cold affection and vntoward deuotion. Remember we therefore from whence we are falne, and doe we our first workes, before the golden can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticke be taken away by captiuitie (as sometimes was <hi>Iudah</hi>) or at best be turned vpside downe, and the light of God his worde out out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:16829:24"/>Secondly, we may see whence it springeth that peoples <hi>memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> are so apt to euil, but very slippery for retaining good: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because they doe not with the faithfull here dedicate them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good, but rather vnto things euil: euil simply, or at best, euil in some respect. For as a mans hand is readiest in that worke it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily exerciseth, euen so is the <hi>memory</hi> fittest to receiue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordate such stuffe as it hath beene enured with, be it good or bad.

                  <p>Now followeth the whole [<hi>Righteousnesses do loue thee</hi>] as if she should say,<q> whatsoeuer is righteous in my Minde, righteous in my wil: Yea whatsoeuer fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as Christ testifieth himselfe to be <hi>Trueth</hi> (because man is enlightned with no truth, that is not from Christ, who lightens euery man that commeth into the world. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.9.) so the Apostle S. <hi>Iohn.</hi> is bold to say, <hi>Euery spirit confessing that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is come in the Flesh, is of God.</hi> Now we know that repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, yea, that men really infested with the diuel, they can in such fearefull estate say, <hi>That Iesus Christ is come in the Flesh:</hi> therefore the diuell, or reprobate, in such an estate, is ouer-ruled and acted by the spirite of Christ Iesus, the causer of such truth. For if in God we liue, mooue, and haue our being, <hi>Acts.</hi> 17.28. then no tongue for speaking, nor hand for working doeth mooue, but it moues in God: and in mouing rightly, it moueth in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but moouing otherwise it mooueth in iudgement. Boldely therefore may all faithfull-ones conclude, that all <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> is of God, and therefore all <hi>Right things</hi> must loue him. Nay, they cannot but loue him, seeing they are al sparkles of that infinit light, and effects of that most blessed Cause of Causes, which is Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it followeth, that all <hi>Vnrighteousnesses,</hi> euen euerie particular braunch thereof, it is an Enemie to God. And no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, because it is not of God, but of the diuel, (<hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.44.1.

                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.8.) who was a lier from the beginning and an opposer vnto Iustice. Whatsoeuer therefore is an error in sense, an error in affection, an errour in action, it is of the diuel, and an enemie to God. The consideration whereof should mooue all, first to nourish euery part of Iustice, because it is our Kings friend: but secondly, to mortifie and kill euery particular vnrighteousnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a Traitour to our King; yea a snake in our bosome, bred otherwise for our owne destruction: calling for fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, as somtimes vpon the <hi>Pentapole-citties,</hi>

                  <p>I am not ignorant that some (otherwise worthy much reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) haue herein contradicted the Ancients, and peremptorily affirme, that that marriage of <hi>Salomon</hi> with <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter, it could not be a figure; and why?

                     <hi>Cyrus</hi> was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised Gouernour, and yet <hi>Meshicho,</hi> his (euen <hi>Iebouahs</hi>) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted, and a figure of <hi>Messiah</hi> in conquering the aduersary, and freeing his people, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 45.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the Iewes were not forbidden simply all marriage with the Gentiles: but to beware of al such marriage as might draw them to Idolatry.

And like enough that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter learned that lesson, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.10.11.) then marriage might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be attempted.

                  <p>In this hir confession [<hi>I am blacke</hi>] the Church of Gentiles la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to satisfie the Sinagogue of the Iewes, and that by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgem<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of hir swart hue &amp; complexion. Whence we may obserue, first, how readie the Iew is to except at imperfections in the Gentile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea sometimes to shut the doore of mercie vp against the Gentile, himselfe notwithstanding vnwilling to enter in. The crosse nature of which people, our Sauior detecteth in the Scribes and Pharises, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.13. The same doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> in 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.14.15.16.

In a word, that people at this day stand hardly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards vs: yea, (as appeareth in their confession of faith) they dayly curse vs: and as some of their words haue bin vttered heere in our Land of late, they iudge vs vtterly vnworthy of GOD his loue: making our spirituall blackenesse one maine reason, why they cannot be well perswaded of our faith.</p>
                  <p>To spie and except at our imperfections, it is in them (poore soules) a thing ordinary and naturall. But in the second place what learne we? Namely, with all readinesse and faithfulnesse to confesse our sinnes before them: yea, our great vnworthinesse of so worthy a Messiah, saying, indeede I am blacke: that is (as the Apostle speaketh in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18.) I know that in me, namely, in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. And where no good thing dwelleth, there must needes dwell blackenesse, darkenesse, and horrour of nature. But alas, wee are so farre from giuing a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent accompt of our faith and standing vnto <hi>Ierusalems</hi> people, as rather we will curse them, and spit our gall vpon them, as vppon dogges. Indeede their pulling of Messiahs blood vpon their heads, it hath brought them into a fearefull estate: yet seeing their fall was our rising, their cutting off our ingraffing, wee should compassionate them. Nay, seeing <note n="*" place="margin">Ro. 11.25, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>obstinacie is come vpon them,</hi> in part till the Gentiles number be fulfilled, and then all Israel shall be saued, (because God his couenant is to take away their sinnes, and to regraffe them in his fauour) we should pray for them, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16829:26"/>
euery way practise the remoouall of such offences, as wee know do hinder them from ioyning with vs. The Elder brother as yet standeth for the most part without, angry and grieued at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall Gentile come within (<hi>Luk.</hi> 15.28. <hi>Iaphets</hi> people in <hi>Shems</hi> tent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.27.) But seeing the Father will come forth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate him to enter and be reconciled, what are we to stand on our start-vps, and not rather to humble our selues to our elder brother (as <hi>Iaakob</hi> sometimes did to <hi>Esau</hi>) that so happily we may become one sheepefold, and no longer to be deuided? We can readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse others of blacknesse and spirituall deformities, saying: <hi>Thou art wicked, he is wicked, they are Antichristian, &amp;c.</hi> But very fewe smite themselues on the thigh saving, <hi>O what haue I done?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as euery true member of the Church must and will (for glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and remoouall of offence) particularly confesse, I am blacke, herein I am wicked: as <hi>Dauid</hi> said to <hi>Nathan,</hi> I haue sinned.</p>

                  <p>The first propositions consequent shee denieth, saying. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding my blackenesse, I am to be desired. And this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable state of hers, she enlargeth by comparison, and drawne first from <hi>Kedars</hi> tents, secondly from <hi>Salomons</hi> curtaines: <hi>q. d.</hi> I am (notwithstanding my blackenesse) to be desired as <hi>Kedars</hi> tents. Yea (which more is) as <hi>Salomons</hi> curtaines: so farre am I (because of blackenesse) from being not to be desired. From whence we may obserue, first how <hi>Preiudice</hi> and <hi>Enuie</hi> hindreth Iudgement and true forme of Reasoning: for the Synagogue thinketh she reasons passing firmely, in saying, <hi>Thou art blacke, therefore not to be desired:</hi> whenas the Holy-ghost by the church of the Gentiles doth denie such consequence, affirming and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding rather the contrary. Such preiudice and enuy caused the Donatists in <hi>Affrike</hi> to conclude all Churches (sauing their owne) to be false Churches, because of some generall euills. <hi>August.</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them that it followeth not [<hi>Because of many euills, therefore no true Church</hi>] seeing Tares will be in the Lords Catholike wheate field, and chaffe in the Lords barne floore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after it hath

beene a while threshed. The Brownists (about some 20. yeares since begun, and yet persist) they furbish the Donatists canker-fret arguments: but indeede with some aduantage. For whereas <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> granted other Churches once to haue beene true Churches, the Brownists affirme the English Church neuer to haue beene a true Church. As herein more vncharitable (seeing themselues neuer receiued faith elsewhere) so more subtile in their businesse, (for the subtile beast of the field hath inspired them with more craft, wonne by more experience) and this manifested by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plantation of a true Church here. In more auncient historie, though they vse them and admit them in some other cases, yet not in this, and why? Men are subiect to errour: and though a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ancient Writers doe testifie this, yet (forsooth) they know not, but they may lie. Where first it was no Church, <hi>Because it was blacke,</hi> now it is no Church, because <hi>it neuer was one.</hi> Thus <hi>Donatus</hi> one spirit hath taken to himselfe seauen stronger diuells. For neuer is an old heresie reassumed and renouated, but with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of euill, that so it may not againe be easily dispossessed. Their frenzie I haue <note n="*" place="margin">In my Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doton, and new Ierusha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</note> 
                     <hi>else-where</hi> largely confuted. Onely, let this forme of the Synagogues blinde reason, teach vs to auoyde preiudice and enuious conceipt, left, in stead of reasoning <hi>For,</hi> wee reason <hi>Against</hi> the truth. Enuy is blinde, and frameth but blinde arguments: Whereas Charitie seeth reasons rightly, and giueth to euery soule the due.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we learne from the Church of Gentiles to be careful in distinguishing betweene good and euill, and to giue to either the due. For as we are not to call euill good, so neither to terme Good Euill, vnder paine of Gods curse, and as hee would not be held abhominable before the Lord: <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Prou.</hi> 17.15. Yea, to hold fast (with <hi>Iob</hi>) our innocencie to the very death (<hi>Iob</hi> 27.3, 4, 5, 6.) howsoeuer in some other things and respects, our owne mouth shall condemne vs, and our owne garments make vs filthy, <hi>Iob</hi> 9.20.30, 31. For to make euill good, and good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, it is the worke of the diuel, and the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of confusion.</p>
                  <p>Touching the comparison drawne from <hi>Kedars</hi> tents, and <hi>Salomons</hi> curtaines, it may well be conceiued that shee vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth both of them to be amiable and loue-some. For <hi>Salomons</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:16829:27"/>
curtaines none doubts it, but else for <hi>Kedars</hi> tents diuerse take them to be a demonstration of her blackenesse, as the other of her comlinesse: and this is their reason: the Kedarites dwelt in tents and open fieldes, where all was exposed to the parching Sunne, therefore more like to set forth her blackenesse. True it is that they dwelt in tents pitched in the desart, <note n="*" place="margin">

As Loue wil couer a multitude of transgressious (specialy in zealous Brethren) so the Soule that is humbled in the owne eies, it will not stand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these tearmes, <hi>I am Elder, I am Better, I haue the better cause &amp;c.</hi>) but, for edification sake (where hope of edification is not barred vp, it will cause a soule to vse soft words, to desire reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.

                  <p>The reason of her <hi>Petition</hi> lieth in the other part of the Verse: and that is drawen from the cause of her Blackenesse.

                     <hi>Sunnes</hi> hote piercing rayes in <hi>Aegipt.</hi> Further (by the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion) I vnderstand the Priests and Prophets of <hi>Aegipt</hi> vnder the terme, <hi>Mother-sonnes: q.d.</hi> Besides that, my natiue country is a scorching soile, I haue bin drawne many times abroade into the heate (from one vineyard to an other, from one greene tree and groue to another, and this by the Prophets of mine owne natiue soile, by the Sacrificers of <hi>Osiris (Mitzraims Bacchus)</hi> whose spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall menaces drew me to pilgrimage in the sultring seasons. This double consideration she propounds for mitigation of the Iewish censure. From whence we learne, first, that forraine and externall lettes and hindrances they excuse man to man many times <hi>à toto</hi> wholy: and they excuse vs before God, though somtimes not a <hi>àtoto</hi> wholie yet <hi>à tanto</hi> in part, the sinne being so much the lesse. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, seeing cases heere are shadowes of spirituall cases wee are to obserue, first, that naturall light and heate (represented by the <hi>Sunne</hi>) in themselues the good creatures of God, they are by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Soules disease, means of making vs more blacke. The heate of concupiscence spotteth our thoughts, words, and workes: and the light of our minde (termed Conscience) it bewraieth our blackenesse: the first acteth our blot, the second declareeth it: but the light of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> (the pure law of God) it more reveales it, for the testimony of God is greater then the witnesse of our heartes 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, these that are brethren (borne and nourished in the same Church with vs) they many times that should be leaders of the people, shall prooue such as cause people to go astray (a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall complaint of the Prophets) and I wish that our Churches stomake had not cause to abhorre many, for teaching people Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauels pollicies and Romish traditions, rather then doctrine, which is according to godlinesse, and many times shall thrust poore soules out of liuing, out of calling, yea out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues: and somtimes (which is <hi>Romes</hi> Catholike practise) out of their liues, thinking (such shall be their blinde zeale, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The second part of her petitions reason, it is gathered from an internall cause of her blackenesse, and that is, her owne inherent negligence in looking to her owne vine, her owne particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and proper duty; wherein wee see an opposition betweene that shee <hi>omitted</hi> and <hi>committed.</hi> She omitteth her owne taske, and vndergoeth an other: that is, leaueth good, and taketh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Petition,</hi> I obserue, First, the amiable forme she vseth: Secondly, the matter it selfe. The forme is this: <hi>O thou whome my Soule loueth</hi>: a forme passing amiable, amorous, piercing: for by it she expresseth the <hi>Character</hi> or print of her Soules affection towards <hi>Messiah.</hi> And hereby she teacheth, first howe God in Christ Iesus is beloued of the whole Church: namely, with the very Soule. Externall ceremonies are (without this) but a dead carcase, a stinking and abhominable sacrifice. This loue of the soule is the Generall of these particulars in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Luke.</hi> 10, 27. Soule being put for all the faculties and powers of nature. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, euery member of this church is enabled of GOD in due time, particularly to say, <hi>Thou whom my soule loueth.</hi> As <hi>Thomas</hi> by way of application, <hi>My Lord and my God</hi> (<hi>Iohn.</hi> 20.28.) and <hi>Dauid, Oh Lord my portion, Psal.</hi> 119.57. For all knowledge (without habilitie to apply Christ and his benefites to this poore soule, it is but <hi>Speculation,</hi> not <hi>Practise</hi>: a generall <hi>Surueyance,</hi> no particular <hi>Possession.</hi> The first in Deuils and Reprobate, but this peculiar to God his chosen.</p>
                  <p>For the matter of this Petition, it is Refection or Comfort: &amp; this laide downe in two braunches: first, in desiring, to knowe of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16829:30"/>
Christ the place of his feeding: secondly, the place of lying downe in the daies heate, euen then when the Sun was come to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridional point. To desire <hi>Repast,</hi> and to desire <hi>Rest</hi> after repast, it is naturall (irrationall creatures desire both these: for by the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> they labour the conseruation of Nature) but to couet so to eate, and so to rest after meate, as the Church doth heere, it is not naturall, but spirituall: not an act of Nature, but of Grace: from aboue, not from the earth. For the first, she coueteth to know where Christ feedeth. What, where he feeds himselfe alone? Nay, where hee feedeth with his little flocke (opposed to his companions flockes after) yet she speaketh of him so singularly, as if he were alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause HE, and the sheepe of his Pasture are One: to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, not seuered. (For God and Man in Christ are vnited and made one:) and therefore euery member of this body, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to feed with this Head: where this carcase (Christ-crucified is) thither these Eagles resort, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.28. Yea, to the ende they may finde this foode for themselues and their yoong-ones, they make their abode, vpon the toppe of the Rocke (though in the earth, their cogitation is aboue) and from high discerne, and thence repaire for soules nuriture, <hi>Iob.</hi> 39.30.31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Besides, (by introducing him as a shepheard, and her selfe as a sheepe (an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion ancient, and in scripture frequent, <hi>psal.</hi> 23.1, &amp; 95, 7. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 34.31, &amp;c.) she thereby would testifie, not only her place of subiection, but also, her readines, euen euery soules readines to aberre, to wander out of the way, without this great shepheards direction. <hi>Moses</hi> was no sooner in the mount for a few daies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siant, but <hi>Israel</hi> staied in the Wildernesse. Christ was no sooner brought before the Rulers, but <hi>Peter</hi> looseth him himselfe: and had not the Lorde by his vnder-shepheard <hi>Nathan</hi> sought vppe <hi>Dauid, Dauid</hi> had starued in the pit. O Lord (for thy Sons sake) leaue not the sheepe of thy English pasture to their owne heartes (for then we should wander and loose ourselues for euer) But let thy sauing grace preuent vs in our euils, and glorifie thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Rest</hi> after soules repast, she vttereth that in the next branch, coueting to know where he caused his flocke to couch in the heat of the day. Teaching hereby, first, that after the soule hath beene well fedde (specially in the blessed word and sacraments) it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueteth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16829:30"/>
a place of rest, wherein it may ruminate and chaw the cud, by spirituall meditation. Such Animals as vnder the Lawe did chaw the Cudde, and did part the hoose, <hi>Leuiticus</hi> 11.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were counted cleane: but if they only chawed the cudde, not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the hoofe: or parting the hoofe, chawed not the cudde, these were accounted pollution and vnholy. As for the she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pe, he lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked neither. This was a resemblance of the Gentiles soule-pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till <hi>Messiah</hi> tooke away the partition wall, and cleansed them by the faith of the Gospel. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with 15.7, 8, 9. And such is the state of euery soule, as first ruminates not on spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts: or ruminating thereon, doe not after that parte the foote, that is, put a difference betweene spirit and spirite, doctrine and doctrine, one action and another. For, not to part the things which God hath parted, is but to mingle and confound Christ with <hi>Belial</hi>: to ioyne yron and clay togither, which can neuer bee made one: and yet (vaine-men) how many now be there among vs, that sweat and fret for concluding such mongrell religion, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardly deuotion!</p>
                  <p>As the Lords minister would be well accepted of GOD, hee must take the precious from the vile. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 5.19. and as euery soule would be taken for a sheepe of Christes Pasture, he must try the Spirits: and trying al things by the touchstone of iudgement diuine, he must retaine that is good, and flie that is euill, 1. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 4.1.1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.21, 22. Such meditation, such partition, is, in some measure, in euery true Christian. By the first, there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with the nature diuine: by the second, a declaration of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine discretion: and in both (for the one can no more be without the other, then faith without works) there is pictured forth, God sitting in that Conscience, as a Pilote at the shippes helme, steering all to the hauen of Heauen.</p>
                  <p>And that she couets this ruminating place in the time of daies heate, it teacheth vs, not only to expect affliction and persecution as an vnseparable companion with the Gospel (2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Reue.</hi> 7.14. figured by the Sunnes heate in <hi>Math.</hi> 13.6, 21.) but also to deale with God before hand by prayer, that wee may in such day of tentation in peace and patience possesse our soules, howsoeuer the body be conuayed through fire to heauen, as <hi>Elias</hi> by the burning Chariot. Such rest of soule we must in the dayes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16829:31"/>
of peace and plenty labour for, pray for feruently: and then no doubt, our eyes shall see rest, and our soules finde comfort vnder the shadow of the <hi>Highest.</hi> But that she saith, <hi>where thou</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">It is in the coniugation <hi>Hiphil,</hi> which signifieth, a double action</note> 
                     <hi>causest</hi> to lie downe, it putteth vs in minde of our Natures backewardnes for couching vnder Gods wing in the day of fiery trial. Shadows of our owne, seeme best and safest vnto vs, (as it was with <hi>Demas,</hi> yea, with <hi>Peter</hi>) but such a shadow shelters onely the body, not the soule: and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> can in that finde no true rest: out he must of that place, and weepe bitterly, for hauing not couched in the right place. Vnwilling wee are to lie downe with Christ: pray we therefore that he may cause vs to goe where hee woulde haue vs to goe: that he may cause vs to lie downe where he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe lieth downe: that as a shepheard he would direct vs with his eye, make vs subiect to his voyce: specially, in the day of tentation to feede and comfort vs: for I thinke a day of tentation is not farre off.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Reason of this Petition followeth.] For why should I be as she that couertly turnes her selfe to the flocks of thy companions?</hi> as if she should say, <hi>There is no reason why.</hi> Where shee might haue affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med plainly that there was no cause why shee shoulde turne from her Beloued to other Riuals, she rather chooseth to speake by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation, for the more patheticall expressement, first, of her Beloueds desert (for he deserued all her loue:) secondly, of her owne soules sinceritie towards him, in that shee concludes it an vnreasonable thing to diuert from the Substance and Truth, to shadowes and falshoode. From whence we may further obserue, first, what the nature of a Schismaticall soule is: secondly, what larues and vniust titles all false Christs and pseudo-prophets doe assume to themselues, for procuring them flocks.</p>
                  <p>For Schismatikes their nature, it is this, not to forsake Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vnitie, without some pretext and colour, as the Church speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here, <hi>Couering themselues.</hi> As they were before but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in the churches bosome, so in their departure (or as <hi>Iohn</hi> cals it, <hi>going out</hi>) they striue to hypocrise more: that is, to maske their faces, to couer themselues with some such attire, as they may not be deemed rending wolues, but simple hearted sheepe.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16829:31"/>
that (were it not for particular fruite whereby they are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from other beleeuers, namely, their false faith, false prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie) the Elect themselues should be seduced by them.</p>
                  <p>And as they will maske in the skins which in right appertaine to Christs sheepe, so they will say they goe out from vs, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are wolues, vncleane birds, &amp;c. that is in truth, because their diuell hath silched away some of our garments while wee haue slept, and therewithall hath put his seruants induments vpon vs: that so wolues may seeme sheepe, and sheepe may seeme wolues. A fruite well beseeming Satan, who transformes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into an Angell of light, 2. <hi>Cori.</hi> 11.14. and a fruite well enough beseeming his Ministers and people, who must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themselues to him that was a murderer &amp; lier from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                  <p>What titles false-Christs and false-Prophets assume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, it appeares in this, that they terme themselues, Christs <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</hi> If they were his Companions indeede, she would not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre Communion with them: but hauing the name, and not the thing, (painted Sepulchers, the inside corruption) she therefore loathes them, and by an holy derision disgraceth them. Such a Companion is <hi>Mahomet,</hi> (a terme stole from <hi>Daniel,</hi> who of <hi>Gabriel</hi> indeed was pronounced<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>Lastly, marke how all these paintings tend to the winning of <hi>Flocks,</hi> that is, of many Congregations: but in very troth, to make them onely Sinagogues of Sathan: hunting by Sea and Land to make <hi>Proselites,</hi> and loe, they make them twofold more the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of hell: <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Math.</hi> 23.15. Christs Church but a flocke: as for these they be many (for it is a broade way that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16829:32"/>
leades to destruction) and their flocks are many: not so much as they be found all of one Religion, as for that they be diuided by the head, howsoeuer ioyned by the tailes, in carrying fire-brands for consuming the Lords wheate-field, like <hi>Samsons</hi> foxes. And hereupon it is, that one Faction is of <hi>Rome,</hi> another of <hi>Arrius,</hi> an other of <hi>Donatus, &amp;c.</hi> all agreeing in one (as the factious in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> did against Christ, and the seditious afterwards against <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Vespatian</hi>) but then diuided amongst themselues (as the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Schismes amongst Brownists and Anabaptists, &amp; betweene Romish schoole-men, not to speak of the late diuision betweene Seculars and Iebusites) and that in some head-points (at least, so imagined of their heades) as therefore they will not ioyne one with another in any spirituall seruice: specially, not in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of holy communion.</p>
                  <p>These euils considered, what maruell is it, that the faithful, not onely desire to attaine the presence of Christ and his flocke more and more; but also conclude peremptorily (by God his help) not to turne aside to such deceiptfull companions?

But seeing the new Testaments Church is here directed to the way of the old Testaments Church, which Church, as <hi>One</hi> is opposed to the <hi>Many</hi> Churches of Heretiques and false Companions, I rather condiscend to the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: although (but here not so necessarily) the plurall <hi>Flockes</hi> it may also intend that one church, considered according to her sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, and variable outward estate: or (which here I take not to be so proper) if this direction should be giuen, not so much to the whole body of Gentiles, as to any one particular distressed soule, then the plurall number implieth sundry particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, &amp;c.</hi> whose vniforme steps are the way which here is propounded. And so the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Numbers may cause a <hi>Diuersitie,</hi> but not <hi>Contradictorie</hi> doctrine. The faithfull of the Gentiles entreated to knowe the place of Christs feeding, and couching of his flocke at mid-day, here she is told how she may come to that place: and that is, first, by <hi>Getting forth</hi>: secondly, by walking in the steps of his flocke.</p>
                  <p>Getting forth, it implieth, either a <hi>Motion from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>: (like as <hi>Israels</hi> going out of <hi>Aegipt</hi> into the Wildernesse: and out of that into <hi>Canaan</hi>) or a <hi>Motion from one qualitie to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>: as when one goeth out of Euill vnto Good (so did the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall, leauing his by wayes, and betaking himselfe homeward: so did the Apostle, when he left his persecuting Christ, and fell to preach Christ) or else it importeth a going from one good quality
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16829:33"/>
to another: not by leauing the first, but by addition thereto. And so <hi>Israel</hi> went from strength to strength, <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. and the first Romans from faith to faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. The first Motion so is <hi>Locall</hi>; the second <hi>qualificatine:</hi> and this latter, either by <hi>Desertion,</hi> or <hi>Addition.</hi> The first motion is naturall, the second is spirituall. Motion from place to place (as the Iewes going out of <hi>Babilon</hi> with their faces towards <hi>Zion</hi>) that was a figure: but for the Elect to go out of the confusion of Nature, into the orderly way of God his spirit leading vnto heauens rest, that was figured thereby. And for this cause <hi>Babylon, Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Sodome</hi> are of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually propounded in <hi>Reuela.</hi> 11.8. and 18.2.4.21. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth our <hi>Factious</hi> of notable blindenesse, who more call people from <hi>Place</hi> then from <hi>Qualitie,</hi> from the figure, rather then that was figured. For if the Church be no more one sort of people (as <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Iewes in <hi>Babylon</hi>) but a catholike people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of all tongues, and stretched forth from sea to sea, how shal the Church goe out of <hi>Locall Babylon,</hi> seeing the <note n="*" place="margin">Antidoton prooueth that at large.</note> wheate-field is the whole earth or world: and the Tares of <hi>Babylon</hi> are sparsed ouer the whole field? How can we make a Locall departure out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> except we go out of the world, that is, transgresse the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the earth?</p>
                  <p>Spirituall motion (figured by the former) wee can here in this world make, God his spirit assisting. And that is it which here the Church of the Gentiles is taught, when shee is bid to get her forth: and this also in both the spirituall senses: first for going out of her former euill vnto good (that is, from her former confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed blacknes and ignorance, vnto puritie and sauing knowledge.) Secondly, from the already confessed measure of grace, vnto a greater measure. The first is taught in such scripture <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. The second in such, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16.1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.10. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</hi> 2.21. And this conuinceth our age notably of euill, where we finde most of the better sort contented with the bare begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Christ, with a slender portion of knowledge, and lesse holinesse: although it is an argument onely of a sound soule, euer to hunger and thirst after more righteousnesse, more holinesse, more knowledge, more faith, more obedience: darkely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by going vp to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and by * <hi>Ezekiels</hi> seauen and eight steps, and the fifteene Psalmes of degrees: <hi>Act.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Luke</hi>

17.10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.22.26.31.34.37. <hi>Psal.</hi> 120. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas a declining from good to euill, is tiped by <hi>Israels</hi> going downe into <hi>Aegypt</hi>: the Mans going downe from <hi>Ierushalem</hi> to <hi>Iericho,</hi> with such like. As for standing at one stay, there is no figure of that: because no soule can liue at one stay of good or euill: for hee that goeth not towards God, hee goeth towards the diuell. For such respect (where the wicked oft are called the sonnes of <hi>Belial</hi> in the old Testament) some take the word <hi>Belial</hi> (in English wicked) to be deriued of <hi>Beli</hi> (in English <hi>Not</hi>) and <hi>Iagnal</hi> (in English <hi>He as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends</hi>) because the seede of Satan <hi>Ascend not,</hi> but contrariwise, <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,</hi> and goe downe from the liuing God; as he that went downe from <hi>Ierushalem</hi> to <hi>Iericho.</hi>

know the truth of faith) can there be any other refuge, but the sacred scriptures.

In the rudiments of the sinagogue we are not to stick, but to ascend and clime higher towards perfection. As grace is enlarged, so obedience must be enlarged. Our Kids by nature, but Lambs by grace, they are to be fedde aboue, they are to be taught the mysterie of this Kingdome: <hi>A mysterie, kept secret from the worlds beginning, but now is opened and published among all Nations by the scriptures of the Prophets, at the commandement of the euerlasting God for the obedience of faith, Rom.</hi> 16.25.26.</p>

From which places we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the strength and speedinesse of Ministers, and their faithful Hearers. The true Ministers of God, they are the strength of the Church, as <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> the strength of <hi>Israel.</hi> As for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people, they are the strength of the worlde.</p>
                  <p>Where Vision failes, the people doe perish: as when <hi>Moses</hi> was in the Mount, <hi>Israel</hi> fell to Idolatrie in the vallies. When the Church is remooued, the world is adiudged: euen as when the eight soules were closed in the darke, and <hi>Lot</hi> with his <hi>Three</hi> got forth of the Citty: the world was drowned, and <hi>Sodome</hi> burned. As the Prophets of God are the strength of the Church, so the Church it selfe is as <hi>Ailas</hi> shoulders, the very pillars of the world, The first must teach the Church to make much of her Teachers:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16829:41"/>
the second must enforme <hi>Sodome</hi> to leaue grieuing of <hi>Lot:</hi> I mean, it must teach the world to make much of the Church. Otherwise, they shall at last learne, that the departure of <hi>Iaakob,</hi> is the losse of <hi>Labans</hi> thrift. Besides, the faithfull (Preachers and Hearers) must learne, that as they are called to be strong, yea pillars for strength (the first Epistle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the sixteenth Chap. and thirteenth verse, <hi>Galat.</hi> the second Chapter and ninth verse,) so to be speedie, (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> Chapter nine, verse foure and twentie) for cursed (saith <hi>Ieremy</hi>) are they that doe the worke of the Lorde negligently.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, marke the speach of our <hi>Salomon, My horses in the Chariots of</hi> Pharaoh: the Palfries <hi>His,</hi> the Chariot <hi>Pharaohs.</hi> What is this, but that the spirit of Strength and Speede it is Christs; and the vntoward flesh (which is to be drawne by the same druine Spirit) it is of the world and the very Chariot of Satan.

                  <p>The Churches strength and celeritie so laid downe, now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth her beauty: first in respect of her <hi>cheekes</hi>: secondly, of her <hi>necke.</hi> The Cheekes are compared with his palfries reines, stretched down<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Touching the first, if thereby were entended only hir cheekes, I would conclude, that chiefly thereby were meant her spirituall complexion amiable in the eyes of Messiah: but seeing the word <hi>Lèchájáik</hi> is properly <hi>Thy Iawes,</hi> I take it, hee rather intends the mouth bridled and kept backe from riotous speach. A lesson taught by Saint <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>Ch.</hi> 1.19. when he saith, <hi>Be slow to speake.</hi> And the person that can bridle his tongue, is by him in Ch. 3.2. called <hi>Téleios anér</hi> a consummate or perfect man. A lesson lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Ps.</hi> 39.1. when he writes: <hi>I haue said, I will keep my wayes from sinning in my tongue: I will keepe my mouth bridled, whiles the wicked is with me.</hi> And this was the lesson that <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Pambo</hi> (a simple vnlearned man) desired to learne: and to that end me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated on this speach of <hi>Dauid</hi> whole nineteene yeares, as <hi>Socrates</hi> the Schooleman recordeth. Nor maruell at it: for if he that can bridle his speach be a <hi>Perfect man</hi>: and if the gift and grace of so guiding the Iawes, bee compared to rainges of precious stones, it must necessarily be an hard thing to obtaine: seeing excellent things are not easily attained. And this grace lacking, marke what the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> saith: <hi>Toú tou mátaios hê thrêskeia, This Mans Religion</hi> (or worship) is in vaine.</p>
                  <p>For the second part of her comlines, it is her necke chained. These Chaines I take to be only the sacred laws of God, legall and Euangelicall. It was but one Chaine to the furnishing of <hi>Israel,</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.11: but here vnto the new testaments church it is chaines. The Sinagogues chaine is expressed by the word <hi>Rábid</hi> simply a Chaine or ornament: but this churches Chaine is expressed by the woorde <hi>Chárûs,</hi> which signifieth rather a Chaine of pearle or precious stone. Looke how one lincke is wreathed in another, so is one law clasped with the other: and as many pearles are drawen vpon one threed for making of one Chaine, so are many precious promises (compared by our Sauiour to <hi>Pearle</hi>) continued in one, by the draught of one and the same diuine spirit. All which, vnity of law and Gospel should teach vs to be at vnitie therewith, as also one with an other. At vnitie with the commaundements of God, we are taught in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where we are commaunded to haue them in our heart, to binde them for a signe on our hand, and as frontlets betweene our eies.

                  <p>The worke is considered in two degrees: first, in borders of Gold: secondly in embroyderie of siluer.

And worthily is the foundation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto golde, and the building there vpon, compared but to siluer: because we are to be saued by the foundation, not by that is edified thereon, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. &amp;c. The first is our Iustification, the second is but as fruits growing from thence, that is, actions of sanctification. Thus out of her naturall imperfection, God (that called light out of darknesse) doth worke vpon, and in, his church, perfection. Forget we therefore (as did the Apostle) the way we haue already runne, and presse we forward to the marke of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction placed before vs.</p>
                  <p>Her disease of blackenesse he thus hath cured, by putting his beautie vpon her. Her languishment in lacke of his presence, this he promiseth to cure, in after season. Thus he <hi>Praiseth,</hi> and thus he <hi>Promiseth,</hi> to what end? <hi>Vt laudando, &amp; promittendo virtus crescat.</hi> That by such praise and promise, vertue in her may be enlarged.</p>

If wee consider this table heere in the Kingdome of grace (and the circumstance of time doth properly teach that) then it is that Chatholike Vnitie begunne here: somewhat repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by our feasts of loue termed <hi>Agapai</hi> wherein the open wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are of Saint <hi>Iude</hi> verse 12. compared to spots. Which feasts of Loue, the Corinths did keepe before the Lords supper, but with horrible schisme: contrary, not onely to the end of that feast, but also of the Lords supper ensuing: for in that sacramentall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the vnitie of Christ and his members is notably signified and sealed. For as the circled vnitie beginnes and ends in Christ, who is our <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> first and last: so besides, he giueth vnto these faithfull ones himselfe for foode: that so in a spirituall sorte <hi>He,</hi> the King, and they the people may become one, as in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall sorte the bread and wine becommeth one with our natures.

                  <p>Some here will obiect, Christ knew <hi>Iudas</hi> to haue an euill hart, yet he admitted him to this sacred communion. I answere: first, admit he was admitted: that yet is nothing to vs, seeing he was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wicked, that is, a maskt hipocrite, and vnseene of the church. Seene he was of God, but not of Man. For Christ, in respect of his manhoode, no more knew that <hi>Iudas</hi> was to be the traitour, then thereby he knew the latter day, whether the terme <hi>latter day,</hi> haue relation to the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>Ierushalems</hi> or the worlds downe-fall.</p>
                  <p>His manhood knew by <hi>Dauids</hi> Prophecie, that one of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars should betray him, but who was the person, he knew not, except by <hi>Communication</hi> of the other nature, his God-head. Whereas, not the things of the God-head, but the peculiars of the manhood, are for our imitation. Secondly, though from the first three Euangelists it hardly appeareth otherwise but that hee was present (because of the Histories mixture, and mixture of Times) yet from Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 13. chap. and 30. verse, it is plaine hee was absent. For there it is said: <hi>Assoone then as he had receiued the soppe, he went immediatly out.</hi> Now the soppe was of the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, not of the Lords supper which was in the last place instituted.

The first of these doe specially respect God, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond our Neighbour. For as in Church-Communion; God and Man are considered at <hi>one,</hi> and in Christ made <hi>one:</hi> so, no soule can manifest it selfe to be of this fellowship, that first, persumeth not Christs head: then secondly his members with this aromatike odour. Christes head is the Father, and his body is the church, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 12.27. To the Father of heauen are all deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heart to be offered vpon the golden altar of Messiahs obedience: for onely this <hi>Angell</hi> of the <hi>East</hi> (<hi>Reuel.</hi> 8.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) whose starre appeared in the <hi>East,</hi> hath a golden censor, for cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the prayers of the Saints. As for the oblations of the hand, (the contribution of the faithfull) they appertaine to the faithfull needy-ones. Do good we must vnto all, but specially to the hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of faith, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.10. And this specialtie appeareth, when as the speciall almes (termed the Collection for the saints, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. and sundry times called a <hi>Grace</hi> in 2. <hi>Corinthi.</hi> 8. and 9.) they be appropriated to the vse of the sanctified, of the Gracious. Not that we are to contribute onely to the visible Gratious (for as God without respect to mans worke dooth good to the verie wicked: so, are we) but <hi>specially</hi> we are to tender the gracious: as God by a Speciall grace hath regarded them beyond others. In both we are to be like vnto God: and both of them be vnto him, as the Morning and Euenings incense.</p>
                  <p>Thus Christ as a King feasteth with his church and the church againe feasteth with him in sauourie words and workes, but made sauourie onely by his spirit. <hi>Iudas Iscariot</hi> will finde fault with the effusion of this oyle, not because he loueth the poore, but for that he hath the bagge, and studieth how to robbe the poore. Let not <hi>Mary</hi> cease to offer her Deuotions to God, and her Almes to Messiahs members: for howsoeuer <hi>Iudas</hi> thinke all, but oyle spilt vpon the ground, our <hi>Iesus</hi> will say, No, let her alone, against the day of burying she kept it. There be a number of Dogges now, that neither will themselves doe good to the poore, nor can bee
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16829:45"/>
contented that others do them Good. With <hi>Iudas</hi> they thinke all lost that is spent vpon Christ and his members (and herevpon it is, that our Ages Atheists doe robbe the Church) intending with <hi>Iscariot</hi> the paunching of themselues. Let them in time repent, and in time make restitution, lest God in his iustice do leaue them with theefe-<hi>Iudas</hi> to the halter: or at least, to haue their portion with Hypocrites and Foxes.

                  <p>Let Iesus and his members feast together while they may: for after the <hi>feast</hi> there wilbe a <hi>fast,</hi> a day of Crucifixion, a darke and gloomie day.

Eyes of the faithfull, they be <hi>Corporeall,</hi> or <hi>Mentall,</hi> or <hi>Personall.</hi> Corporeall or bodily eyes be externall instruments seated in the head (as the windowes of nature) hauing liddes (as Port-cluses) for drawing vp, or letting downe, according as inward sense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincteth. The sense of vnbridled conceipt in <hi>Lot,</hi> it caused him, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 13.10.) to draw his Port-cluse vppe, for better discerning what grounds might make for his most aduantage. The inward sense of holy conceipt or chaste thought in <hi>Iob</hi> (cap. 30.1.) it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to let his eye-casements downe, lest hee should first see a maid (as <hi>Dauid</hi> saw <hi>Bathsheba</hi>) and so consequently, his thought should adulterate: for eyes vnbridled, are said of <hi>Peter</hi> (in 2. <hi>Ep.</hi> 2.14.) to be eyes filled with adultery.</p>

And so while they talke of bearing the crosse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they will neuer suffer for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deuotion.

                  <p>For Mentall eyes, they be the inward senses of nature (as <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, Phantasie, Conceipt, &amp;c.</hi>) who haue chiefly their seate in the head; commaunding the externall senses, as Kings commaund their subiects.

In that part, the Church begunne the Song, and both Christ and she ioyntly conclude it. In this chapter are two parts: the first vttered in the first seauen verses: the other in the residue. This next part is begunne by Christ, but finished by his Church. In the two first verses, Messiahs speech lieth: who in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16829:58"/>
the first verse singeth his owne state; and in the second, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the faithfull and his members.</p>
                  <p>The speech of himselfe, is a declaration of his lotte in his first comming, namely, his humiliation in the flesh. And this is done by way of comparison: by setting forth his condition vnder the the <hi>Rose</hi> of a certaine peculiar <hi>Feild,</hi> which from the originall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be <hi>Sharôn:</hi> secondly, he doth assimilate himselfe to the precious <hi>Lilly of the vallyes.</hi> And both of these applied to his owne praise. To his owne praiset Yea. But how can one with praise, praise himselfe?</p>
                  <p>It is lawful for a man to commend his owne things, when the praise thereof is giuen to God: specially, being forced thereto by way of Iustification, through the calumniations of wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And so the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> commended his guiftes and worke (the false Apostles labouring to disgrace the same) when otherwise himselfe acknowledgeth it to be but the fashion of a foole. But for <hi>Messiah</hi> to praise himselfe, it is without question euer lawfull and good: first, for that he is God, and therefore cannot sinne: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that he is Man filled with the holy Ghost beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and therefore his actions holy, and all of them infinitely praise-worthy.</p>

The bitter heat of his fathers hand forcing him to sweate clotted blood, it caused him to cry out, <hi>Let this cup passe away from me.</hi> The withdrawing of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> did so freeze and nippe the Manhood, as it caused him on the other side to cry, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me</hi>? Heat burnt him, cold starued him: nor maruaile. For howsoeuer in himselfe hee was worthie of a temperate place in the earth, yet because of vs his members (euen for our redemption) he was to passe through hot fire and cold water: euen through the extreames of his fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.

                  <p>Orient of hew, the church doth preach him in this <hi>Song,</hi>when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> she saith:<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 5.10</note>
                     <hi>He is white and ruddy, the chiefest of ten thousand.</hi> White and redde meeting in a rose (and that in a principall maner) it is a beauty of beauties: and such is the beautie of Iesus. No maruell then though the Psalmist thus say to him, <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 45.2</note>
                     <hi>Thou art fairer than the children of Men.</hi> Here I might introduce the <hi>Physiognomie</hi> of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus according to ancient Record, but that I leaue to the fift Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                     <hi>He hath neither forme nor beautie: yea that when we should see him, there should be no forme for which wee should desire him.</hi> Hereto I answer: the corporeall sight of Iesus, it spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially appertained to the Iews, who indeed would take no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16829:59"/>
of him (notwithstanding Natures beautie) because as an earthly King he came not to them with earthly pompe. And the rather, for that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises</hi> had taught them, that not only <hi>Messiah</hi> would come, none should know from whence: but also, should gather all the Iewes together, and stablish amongest them an earthly Kingdome. Such a painted forme, he brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not with him. Secondly, such simple externall forme (the place considered) may well denote the state of his body on the Crosse, which (no doubt) by reason of blowes, thorne-prickings, and spatterings vpon, could appeare nothing at all beauteous. Oh vile sinne of ours, so to blemish the Roses white and redde! But if the Person of <hi>Messiah</hi> be in it selfe considered, it must needs be beauteous. Why? Because there was no sinne in him. Sinne brought in death: and death spreads through nature corruption: corruption labours deformitie: so that without sinne nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not admit deformitie.<note n="*" place="margin">Actes 2.31</note> And herevpon it was, that his flesh in the graue, did feele no corruption. Nay, where the <hi>Manhood</hi> was not onely free from sinne, but also fully assumed and wedde vnto the <hi>Godhead,</hi> there cannot be deemed onely want of deformitie, but also a perfection of lineaments and beautie. But for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie which he here propoundeth to his church, it is not corporeall (because <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> must not cleaue to that) but rather spirituall.: Like as when the Psalmist hauing saide, <hi>Thou art fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer than the children of Men,</hi> doth adde (as a reason) <hi>Grace is powred in thy lippes:</hi> giuing to vnderstand, that the Grace of the lippes (namely <hi>Wisedome,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 8.1</note> which causeth a mans face to shine) that was <hi>Messiahs</hi> beauty. <hi>Steeuens</hi> face beheld of his foes, they saw it as the face of an Angel: how much more shined it after his golden Oration? And if a little portion of diuine Wisedome cause a sinfull mans face to be beauteous, howe much more must <hi>Messiahs</hi> lippes be ruddie and his face orient, who is the Fathers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Wisedome and the fountaine of graces? That this sauing <hi>Rose</hi> is a cooler, it appeareth by the shield of Faith, wherewith his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers being armed, they quench the firy darts of Satan, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16. For which respect also, he prefaceth the gift of his spirit in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. by filling the churches house with an airy blast. And for like cause diuerse times the operation of his Spirite is compared to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:

                  <p>And comfort must this Odour bring to the soule, far beyond <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that a Rose bringeth to the bodie.

                  <p>What, and who this thorne is, is easily decided.

                     <hi>Naturians</hi> haue borne the world in hand, that by certaine darke shaddowes collected in the ayre, (resembling mens words and works) <hi>Pithagoras</hi> (yea <hi>Abbot Tritemius</hi> and <hi>Bartholomeus Glanduile</hi>) could declare what was done a farre off, so the same word and deede were not aged aboue 24. houres. But if knowledge be held miraculous in the Prophet <hi>Eliseus</hi> bewraying the King of <hi>Aram</hi> his councell (2. <hi>King.</hi> 6.8, &amp;c.) then cannot I but beleeue, there is no such na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall knowledge. That Frier <hi>Bartholmew</hi> teacheth, how by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine artificiall glasses, there might be caused abroad very shapes of bodies, which simple beholders would imagine to be ghostes or spirits: I will easily beleeue the Frier in that, for it may be he had learned it of his Church-priests, who, by such deceiuable shewes made people beleeue, that mens soules walked: who well paied for their paines, could coniure these shadows at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Let <hi>Edmonds</hi> the Iesuite with his Priests make that cleare: who haue caused people to belieue themselues to bee possessed with Diuels; specially, after they had giuen them Potions and Brimstony fumigations, able to traunce an horse. Which Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stony-Diuel they could dispossesse, by ceasing to possesse their bodies any longer with such Hors-drinkes and Helhsh smoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

Wine (as I obserued in the first chapter) bringeth a delight to God and man: to God as it be commeth a Sacrament, that is, as it is taken spritually of the faithfull, in the Lords supper: or meere naturally, as it is in common vsuages. The shadow of Christ comming vppon her soule (as the naturall shadow in the Gospel vpon the diseased) it was vnto her a great comfort; but vnder that shade to be fed with delectable fruite, that caused a greater comfort: but now to bee brought into her <hi>Salomons</hi> banquetting house (standing in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al-hamon,</hi> as a Lord ouer the multitude) this must bring a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort farre more great to the faithfull. Whence we may learne, the nature of Messiahs loue, namely, that it is a continuall grower, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing like <hi>Nylus</hi> and <hi>Iordans</hi> waters ouer their banks: a well of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter springing vp to eternall life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.14.

Contrarie to the nature of carnall Loue, which euer decayeth and lessneth with the time, euen as beautie, health, wealth, strength abateth. But as Christ loues vs not first, by reason of any goodnesse in vs at first, so his loue begun without any cause in vs, doth still enlarge it selfe in and vpon vs. Why? Because whom once he loues he cannot but loue for euer. That crannell must grow to a tall tree, that drop become an <hi>Ocean,</hi> that spark be conuerted into such a flame, as shall consume all as stuble before it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Besides th' encreasement of his loue, hee would by this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting house teach vs the varietie of his Loue. Loue may bee enlarged by enlarging one and the same guift: but when this loue enlargeth it selfe by distribution of sundry comfortable guifts, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much the more it is louesome. He brings not the faithful into his storehouse for adding only faith to faith, but also to faith, <hi>patience, (Iames</hi> 1.3.) to patience, <hi>Experience:</hi> to experience, <hi>Hope:</hi> to hope, <hi>Boldnesse: Rom.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. The fruits of that good spirit by whome he adopteth vs, are not onely these abouesaide, but also, <hi>Loue, Ioy, Peace, long-suffering, Gentlenes, Goodnes, Meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Temperancie, Galat.</hi> 5.22, 23. In a word, Messiah com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth of all his sweet fauors to his church, by faith betroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto him. As the Churle in the Gospel woulde neuer crie, <hi>Heart be at rest,</hi> till all his barnes were filled: so the faithfull, in their holy couetings should much more neuer be at rest, till their soules with diuine graces be filled. But as this fulnesse is not, till we haue attained our perfection in Christ, which is after this life: so these that hunger and thirst after righteous giuings, they are in meane time blessed, because they are of the growing hand in this life.</p>

Thirdly, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth <hi>Timothie</hi> (the Euangelist) to keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement without spot and vnrebukeable vntill the appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ:<note place="margin">1.

Fourthly, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour telleth vs of false prophets that shall come like wolues in sheepes clothing (that is, with a deuouring doctrine couered with Christian conuersation) he doth not say, we shall know them by the name of <hi>Prophet</hi> (for that should agree to ministers of his

Otherwise they should vsurpe, both the conuersation of Christs sheepe, and also the terme <hi>Prophet,</hi> which pertained to his owne ministrie.

And vnto workes of diuine redemption, Christ did send the Iewes for proofe of his being the Messiah: much more may a true Prophet be so acknowledged by his worke of <hi>Gathering</hi> to Christ. The scriptures so do plainely teach, that the ministerie of Apostles, Euangelists, and Prophets is a ministerie continued to the worlds end.

The Presbyters and Deacons proceed in the worke established: the Apostolicall Euangelicall, Propheticall ministrie doth call people into order, and recall the straiers vnto the first pattern. And these new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Prophets (for that semeth to me the aptest title) they haue their calling, as they of the old testament had: Some stirrd vp im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlie of God, &amp; acknowleged to be such for their work sake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some trained vp in the schools of Prophets and sent there-out by the voyce of the faithfull.

The <hi>First</hi> of the <hi>Hindes</hi> (which sustaineth, and is not sustained of any creature: for his owne power sustaines him) it is the <hi>Hinde</hi> of the Morning,<note place="margin">Isa. 63.5.</note> Christ Iesus himselfe. <hi>Paul</hi> followes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> him and bids vs follow, as he is a follower of Christ, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. Christ is the foundation: on him rest the Apostles, and wee rest on them, and weaker are to rest on vs: but no further nor long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than we rest on them that shall rest on Christ. You are to rest on your Ministers, as they on the Apostles, and the Apostles on Christ. But because no soule is to rest it selfe simply on Man, therefore <hi>Marke, Barnabas, Peter, Thomas</hi>; yea, <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iaakob, Iudah, Moses, Aaron, Dauid,</hi> all are noted of the Holy-ghost of error. And because we must rest on them, but as they respect and relie on Christ, therefore He (the <hi>Hinde of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. psal.</hi> 22. in the title) is preferred for all-sufficient. I am able,<note place="margin">Philip. 4.13.</note> (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) to doe all things, through the helpe of Christ, which strengthneth me. As if he should say, through Christes strength I can doe all things, but without him, nothing. For by no other name, then by the name Iesus, are we (saith <hi>Peter</hi>) ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther healed or saued, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.9.10.12.

Not looking euery man on his owne things, but euery man also on the things of other men. Which notably manifests the impietie of our age, where ordinarily people look that others should sustaine them, but they make no conscience of sustaining others. Instead of vpholding their weake brethren with the <hi>Hart</hi> and <hi>Hinde,</hi> they will labour rather to withdraw their shoulder in the time of surg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affliction, that so their fellowe-members may sinke and be drowned amidst their temptation.</p>

The first simplicitie is naturall, the second, spirituall. By the <hi>naturall simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie,</hi> they are carried many times to harken after the delights of this life. Euen then the wicked world is readiest to smite them through; yea, Satan himselfe to snare them. For while the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall hinde listneth to the diuell, to the world and the fleshes Musicke, then Satan lets his arrowes flie, piercing <hi>Iudah,</hi> galling <hi>Dauid,</hi> snaring <hi>Salomon.</hi> By the <hi>spirituall simplicitie,</hi> they are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to listen vnto heauens harmonie, to be lifted vp in the spirite aboue the flesh, and to mount into heauen by the wings of prayer. This melodie is not (as the former) from an euill, but from the good spirite of God. But at such time of spirituall delight, Satan is ready to pull the eye of <hi>Dauid</hi> downe vpon <hi>Bathsheba:</hi> no lesse prest to buffet <hi>Paul</hi> and to gall him in the flesh:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.7</note> Euen as the head Hinde Iesus was then most subtilly assaulted by the diuells armie, whenas in the Garden he was praying seriously, euen in the mount of Oliues contemplating diuinely.</p>
                  <p>In some measure, all the members of Christ Iesus are adapted to the Roes and Hindes of the field: specially his ministers, but principally such of them as haue beene and are the Gathering ministerie: ministers appointed to trauase the Catholike field of Iesus. Which latter paineful mounting spirited ministerie, are the sacred witnesses of the diuine allegeance, whereto the proselites of the Iewes are sworne of the Christian Gentiles. Sworne they are, not to disturbe Messiah, no, not to stirre him vp till he please. While thus they be charged to looke to their allegeance, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Church is couched betweene his louing armes, and sweetely passeth her time in sacred contemplation.

All tending to expresse their mutual affections one towards another, in respect of Christes comming in the flesh, and the new churches glory accompanying the same. In this verse is vttered the churches sense and feeling of Messiahs approaching in the flesh, laid downe first, from the knowledge she hath of his voice; secondly of his pace. The voyce is made excellent by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, when she saith, <hi>It is the voyce of my Beloued.</hi> The Pase is made excellent, first, from a word of attention, <hi>Behold:</hi> second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the speedinesse thereof: once, by saying <hi>he commeth leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer the mountaines and hills:</hi> afterwards, by comparing him for that, to the <hi>Roe or yong Hinde.</hi>

For <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Christ and the New Testaments Church, were parted by that wall of sacrifices and other Leuiticall ceremonies, during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of that ancient Priesthood. And in that Argument (for satisfaction of the Iewes) is the substance of the Epistle to the Hebrewes spent. What a stoppe and partition wall it was, the Proselites of the Gentiles added to the Iewes, but specially the Gentiles seede inclosed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> people, they sawe and felt it with sorrow. Ioy and comfort it was to see Christ standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the wall of oblations, sprinklings of blood and washings: and yet a sorrow to see him so, as vnable to embrace him. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to see the light of the world, behinde the sanctuaries lampes daily burning: but a sorrow to see him slaine, his blood powred out, and his flesh scorched with heauens-fire, in the Bullockes, Goates, Lambs, &amp;c. slaine and burnt within and without the Sanctuarie of Israel.

The wall was a stop, and these windowes are a stay: but much lesse impeding then the former. Yea, these windowes are made (as the Temples windowes were) for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in light.

First, the wall betweene the Church and her Beloued, secondly, the windowes, now lastly, the grates. The first kept them most asunder, the second lesser, the third least of all.

                  <p>Here then we are to obserue, a beginning of Messiahs speach to his Church and continued to the end of the 15. verse, and all this recounted by the mouth of his Church Before shee heard his voice, but a farre off.

                  <p>The Churches speach is <hi>Vocall</hi> or <hi>Mentall.</hi> Vocall speach is that, whereto the Bodies voyce is adopted: and such speach we finde not here (nor in the Gospel, diuerse times) whereto the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer may haue relation.

Here therefore we must necessarily collect, that something was said in the Churches minde, whereto this answer is formed. By his answer, we may easily guesse at her demaund. The answer (as afterwards appeareth) tends to the drawing her forth of an vncomfortable, to a comfortable estate: as it were out of winter stormes into a pleasant spring: her demaund then by Analogie of <hi>Reason</hi>) must be this: <hi>ô Messiah, how long will it be, ere I be deliuered out of this calamitie?</hi> Whereto he answere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This secret complaint must so be our complaint, this demaund our demaund, and the answere heere framed to our Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael which was in bondage of sinne, worse then that of <hi>Aegipt:</hi> captiued of Satan, worse than that of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> The Martire-soules vnder the Altare (<hi>Reuel.</hi> 6.9, 10.) are figuratiuely intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, crying: <hi>How long Lord, holy and true:</hi> what maruell then, if here the faithfull cry, and enquire after deliuery out of Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisme?

                  <p>Israel groaned after deliuerie, and so receiued a comfortable answere. The Gentile church longed after Messiah (for we see how many of them hauing heard <hi>Paul</hi> once, they beseech him to preach the same sermon to them the next Sabboath day, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.42.) and loe, they are here comfortably answered. By which also we may learne to beleeue the readinesse of God to be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if so we call vnto him, in time of affliction, <hi>psal.</hi> 50.15. Yet this must aye be remembred, that God is neuer minded to re-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer anie petition, or demaund with comfort, but where the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition or demaund is framed first by his owne good spirit.

The answer generally so considered, Let vs come to the speach it selfe.</p>
                  <p>The speach vttered by Messiah, is to be considered: first, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the amiable Epithets giuen by him to his church: secondly in wordes of exhortation, and both these in this verse.

The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> first qualification is this: though they be cut downe with afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, corporeall, or spirituall, or both, that they sinke againe (for so these waters runnes ouer <hi>Dauids</hi> soule eftsoones) yet they rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. They may sometimes lodge vnder the mudde of earthly affects (as <hi>Dauid, Salomon, Hezekiah,</hi> and others haue) but vp at last they arise by the spirit of repentance. For a iust man (saith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>) falleth seauen times, but riseth againe. Yea, our sauiour saith seauentie times seauen times, but ariseth againe. By despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they may be kept vnder for a season: but when they seeme swallowed vp of that muddie euill, God giueth them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his spirit whereby they rise as high, as they were falne low. And hereof I could giue particular instance not farre off, without recording of ancient experience. As for externall afflictions, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions corporeall, we see the faithfull that way oft cut downe, sinking vnder as without life, subscribing (as did our worthy Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi>) to muddie conclusions: but such. sleepe not long ere that they arise and burne the hand that so subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. This sinking vnder for a time, is the effect of old <hi>Adams</hi> lust: but this mounting vp againe (euen against all order of nature) is the effect of grace, euen of the seede of election hid in our nature.

As the Lords prophet applied that to the Iewes, so may I to the Gentiles. What substantiall thing is there in our nature, for the which we shold be depended vpon? Behold we are vanitie and lighter then vanitie it selfe. Cursed is he that makes flesh his arme to rest on: yea, that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

to make one pinne of our naturall abillements, as an article of faith to leane vpon. Rather we and our <hi>pura naturalia</hi> deserue to be cast into Hell fire.</p>

                  <p>But here this question may be propounded: Seeing the Elect are alwayes seene of Christ, how comes it that here he craues their sight?

And that time of his iustification by faith, did appeare together with the Ghospels spring-time.

                  <p>As the workes of the sixe dayes were thus sealed vp with a seauenth dayes rest: so the Ancients (not to touch any moderne writers) could apply all to the worlds sixe distinct ages, finishing them with the glorious Sabaoth of Sabaoths, the rest of rests.

after the Saints had rested a thousand yeares, Satan should anew assaile and trouble them.</p>
                  <p>And besides that the number of Sixe is made sacred sundry wayes in the old Testament: we shall finde the new testaments Reuelation, to make it a number of perfection to the Churches workes, when as (<hi>Reuel.</hi> 10.7.) the mightie Angel sweareth, <hi>That in the dayes of the Seauenth Angel, when he shall beginne to found the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished:</hi> as if he should say, the sixe trumpets (referred to the new testaments six ages) shall found to the end of the Churches businesse: for when the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth <hi>beginneth</hi> to found, euen then the mystery is at an end and finished.

Thus Man, in his Innocencie, did stand a shadow of the Sonne of God, Heire of the world: but becomming a Lord of Mis-rule, he lost domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer the creature: and therewith ceased the figure, till (by faith) he became one with Christ, to whom all power in heauen and earth is giuen for himselfe and his mysticall members.</p>

These birds of the aire (representing such people as specially haue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation in heauen) and beasts of the field (denoting such peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as specially sauour earthly things) to the one kinde and to the other, Christ giueth names in his sacred word. The first sort he calleth <hi>Spirituall,</hi> or heauenly: the second <hi>Carnall</hi> or earthly. And as fowles of the heauen haue their difference and distinct names withall, so these spirituall-ones haue their discrepance, for which our Sauiour affoordeth seuerall titles, whether amongst such as gouerne, or are gouerned. The like is amongst the earthly, where some are Leopards, some Beares, some Dogs, and all <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemoth.</hi> But as <hi>Adams</hi> apt termes were changed, what time (at <hi>Babel</hi>) tongues were confounded: So Antichrist in his confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of times and maners, hath giuen new Names to Christs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (as <hi>Nebuchadnetsar</hi> gaue new names to <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 1.6.7.</note>

Had but <hi>Adam</hi> duly considered his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie in shadowe, he would not so easily haue seuered from the substance. But turning his backe vpon the Lord of life he first lost the Image of <hi>Aelohim:</hi> secondly forfaited his Lordship ouer the creature: he thirdly made shippewracke of his variable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for apt appellation: hee fourthly haled paine vppon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde for procreation and education: and fiftly, finally expulsed himselfe Paradise. So ceasing to shadowe the Sonne of God, <hi>ex congruo,</hi> in direct verity, in the next place hee must be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a shadow, <hi>ex oblique,</hi> oppositiuely.</p>
                  <p>That the first <hi>Adam</hi> shadowes foorth the second <hi>oppositiuely,</hi> it commeth to passe through <hi>Adams</hi> sinne; sinne being of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature than contradictorie to God, to righteousnesse, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.

                     <hi>Adam primus &amp; Adam secundus vunm erat carne</hi>) The first and second <hi>Adam</hi> were both One in <hi>Flesh,</hi> yet (<hi>non o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere</hi>) they were not One in worke and in deede.

If he shadowed Christ in the state of <hi>Naturall Holines</hi> (for Holines at first was borne and bred with him) then much more in his State of <hi>Super-naturall holines,</hi> where all was from Heauen anew deriued.

But here being an opposition, not to the body of <hi>Moses,</hi> but to the body of Iesus, (for contending with the Mosaicall shadow, it was a contradicting of Iesus the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) he is not onely taken downe with the respect of his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but also of his Churches <hi>Election,</hi> (vnder the Choise of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalem</hi>) as also of Iesus his preseruation from out the fire of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, what time his fathers indignation flamed against him, for our sinnes sake vpon him. While he burned, the heauenly father seemed to haue forsaken him (for so he cried, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> But hauing burned to the full-point of satisfaction, his father (which was his <hi>owne arme, Isa.</hi> 63.5.) sustained him: vppon which deliuerance hee cried, <hi>It is finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>

                  <p>Lastly, we are to obserue <hi>Iehoshuahs</hi> garments: first, such as were put off: secondly, such as then were put vpon him.

From <hi>Gabriels</hi> speach, some take the 490. yeares should finish with his assuming our nature; in respect of which extraordinary concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they thinke that phrase (<hi>the shewing,</hi> or <hi>The annointing of the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:16829:146"/>
holy of Holies</hi> is vsed. Some thinke by that speach is entended <hi>his Baptisme</hi>: for that the Holy-Ghost then openly ouershadowed him. Others cast the period of these 490. yeares vpon Christs death, because of these words: <hi>After the threescore and two san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Messiah shall be pierced thorough.</hi> Others vnderstanding by <hi>Messiah</hi> or <hi>Annointed,</hi> not <hi>Iesus</hi> the Christ, but the Iewish an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, shadowing Gouernours doe fasten the end of <hi>Gabriels</hi> seauens vpon <hi>Ierushalems</hi> destruction: first, because the Annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gouernement then ceased to be: secondly, for that <hi>Gabriel</hi> in the end of this <hi>Oration</hi> doeth speake of <hi>Ierushalems</hi> desolation, which fell forth about some fortie yeares after Christs ascention. Foure sundry opinions thus arise from three speeches of this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Prophecie. As for them that thinke, howe by a <hi>certaine</hi> number of yeares, an vncertaine is meant, they make the Angel to come about an idle message. He professeth (verse 22.) that he came to <hi>giue knowledge and vnderstanding</hi> to <hi>Daniel:</hi> but if by seauenty seauens he meant eightie seauens, or some other number, then the Angel taught him nothing: for <hi>Daniel</hi> knew before, that Messiah should come and finish our redemption. So certaine an vncertaintie is this, as it is vnworthy to be numbred with the worst of the former foure. For all the former hold the number of 490. yeares proper and certaine, onely they call into question: first when these yeares begunne? secondly, when they finished? And hereunto some of the former haue beene drawne from a certaine computation of the Greekes called Olympique, of the hill <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> where Gallants from all parts came and stroue for the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Garland.

yeare of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Monarchie, wherein hee returned the Iewes: and the ending of <hi>Gabriels</hi> halfe seauen he fastneth vpon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours death.

When the Angel came vnto him, it is noted in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.1. namely, in the first yeare of that <hi>Darius</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> which before diuided the Kingdome with <hi>Cyrus</hi> vppon the present surprizing of <hi>Babel.</hi> Which also in 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.22. and <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.1. is termed the first yeare of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> From this time the computation was to haue his beginning. Which may appeare, first from <hi>Cyrus Edict</hi> then go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> out, wherto the Lord long before had made him his annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:16829:148"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> secondly, from the other <hi>Darius</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. who there groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his proclamation vpon the <hi>Memorandum</hi> of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished-canon. For as the Lawes of <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> were not to be altered (<hi>Dan.</hi> 5.8, 15.) so this King fastens his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement vpon the decree of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> And vnto this <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the Iewes did leane in their answer to the Aduersarie: nor durst the Aduersarie but appeale thereto, if so, such a decree was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> extant, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5.7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c. Thirdly, it appeareth from the Angels mouth, who saith, that the 70<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seauens were to begin with the Edicts out-gate for returning the people to build. Which returne was then made, in the first yeare of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his <hi>Darius.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, if the words outgate must be that of the other <hi>Darius</hi> (which in their computations must be some hundred or 64<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or moe yeares after <hi>Cyrus</hi>) then the age of diuerse of the <hi>Returned</hi> would arise to an incredible number.</p>

                     <hi>Clemens</hi> (whom infinite troopes haue followed) I conclude this, thus: <hi>Quod in septem bebdomadib. aedificatum sit Templum, hoc clarum est:</hi> It is as cleare as the Sunne, that the Temple was aedified in the seauen seauens of yeares: that is, in the first 49. yeares following the Edict of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> And so doth <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>For the last 7. of yeares, therein our Sauiour was baptized, publiquely preached and died. And that his death put an end to this seauen (and so to the 490. yeares.)

And this I will not prosecute in all his particulars (for that were to swimme through an Ocean of ceremonies) but somewhat Generally and Superficially: first, by speaking somewhat of the Persons imployed in sacrifice: secondly, of the sacrifice it selfe.</p>
                  <p>The Persons personally employed in Sacrifice were <hi>Men.</hi> As the Apostle vnder the state of the Gospel, would not at any hand permit a Woman to execute the publike ministerial functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34, 35.1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 12.) because shee was not the first in Creation, though first in transgression: so from the beginning it was in the Church of God, no otherwise practised then by men: as for testifying their headship in that kinde: so, for the better shadowing forth <hi>Messiah,</hi> whome in that action they were represented. Now of men, some haue thought that two sorts were vnto this action before the law licenced: the <hi>First-borne</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> So to conclude, they were led, not by any direct Canon of Gods word, but from such presidents as where they find the elder sacrificing with <hi>Kain</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi>: or (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their Iunior-ship) are found sacrificing with <hi>Habel</hi> and <hi>Abraham.</hi> From which presidents (if their reason be drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to forme, they can no otherwise than thus syllogize: <hi>The Elder and Prophet did sacrifice: therefore onely they two might sacrifice.</hi> This word <hi>Only</hi> in the consequent (more then in th' antecedent) bewrayes a maime in the argument. If they frame their reson thus (<hi>We finde onely them two sacrificing, therfore only they two might sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>) that is so weake as this: <hi>We finde in the word onely, that fire came downe from heauen after the flood, for consuming wicked and the belieuers sacrifice: therefore onely after the flood fire came so downe.</hi>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:16829:151"/>
This reason may be true, yet not <hi>necessarily true,</hi> seeing fire might come downe before (as <note n="*" place="margin">

If any say that <hi>Habel</hi> did not sacrifice but only by the hand of <hi>Adam,</hi> the same may as easily be affirmed of <hi>Kain</hi> the Elder, and yet neither of them prooued; first, because the scripture saith not so: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because no Canon forbade them: thirdly, because we neuer reade of <hi>Adams</hi> sacrificing, although (no doubt) hee sometimes did sacrifice: fourthly, the <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 4.3. &amp;c.</note> text implyeth their immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Iehouah</hi> themselues with their sacrifice.

The Passeouer is a certaine sacred feast, instituted to Israel of <hi>Iehouah:</hi> what time they were presently to depart out of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> that ancient house of Bondage. For the better vnderstanding whereof, I will first obserue the <hi>Name:</hi> secondly, the <hi>Thing</hi> it selfe.

                     <hi>Abib:</hi> in English, a stalke of corne with the eare: so termed, for that Israel in it was to offer the first fruites of corne to <hi>Iehouah</hi> (<hi>Iosh.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.14.) and not onely because in that moneth, the greene eares of corne appeared. Which month is made excellent otherwise; for where before they held onely a Ciuill accompt of the yeare, beginning with <hi>Tishri</hi> (answerable to the greater part of our September; for the worlds creation they held to beginne with the Autumnes Equinoctiall: seeing <hi>Adam</hi> had at first a ripe haruest) this <hi>Abib</hi> was so the seauenth: answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the beginning of the Springs Equinoctiall, entring in March.</p>
                  <p>But now by a new accompt (called the Ecclesiastike recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) the Ciuill seauenth is made the Churches first and <hi>Head-month.</hi> Which in regard of the shadowing feast, doth not onely leade vs to Christ, as he is the head of the Church, from whose raigne in their hearts, the faithfull are to take their accompt: but also, to Christ rising fresh and greene in that moneth, the first fruites of our bodies Resurrection, rising vp to heauens glorie. And that he was this corne, remember his owne speach: <hi>verily, verily, I say vnto you: Except the wheate-corne fall into the ground and die, it bideth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruite.</hi> Iohn. 12.24. When saint <hi>Peter</hi> therefore (of a blind good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) did labour to stay his Maister from so dying: our Sauiour termes him Satan or Aduersarie. To what? To the much fruite which would arise by his dying. And this the Spirite foretolde long before in <hi>Salomons</hi> psalme, saying: <hi>Pissath-bar &amp;c.

                  <p>The month so considered, the <hi>Day</hi> followes. The Day is twofold: first, the tenth day wherein the Animall was prepared: secondly, the fourteenth day, wherein it was slaughtered.

                  <p>This Paschall feasts-meate, was a yeareling of the sheepe or the Goates: that is, a lambe or kidde being a yeare old. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of age, did argue the fulnesse of Christ Iesus (who also is termed our Passouer and paschall Lambe, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.) for the creature (lambe or kidde) in the one of them was represented Innocency: in the other Nocency. The Lambe an innocent thing not opening the mouth against the shearer: the yoong goate a nocent harmefull creature. The lust therefore compared to sheepe, and placed on Christ (the great-shepheard) his right hand: the wicked therefore compared to Goates, and put apart on Christs left hand: as is the Diuel and his Angels. But how could Christ be represented in either? For the Lambe, none doubteth: seeing that hee onely was without blemish, and no guile was found in his mouth. For being a yoong-goat, it was for that, he was not onely <note n="*" place="margin">Beda on Ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>odus 12.</note>
