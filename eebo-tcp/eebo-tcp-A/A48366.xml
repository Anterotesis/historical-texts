            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DESIGN
OF A
British Dictionary,
HISTORICAL and GEOGRAPHICAL;
With an ESSAY, Entituled,
ARCHAEOLOGIA BRITANNICA:
AND A
Natural History of WALES.</head>
            <byline>By EDWARD LHWYD, Keeper of the <hi>Ashmolean Repository,</hi> Oxon.</byline>
            <p>BEING invited by some Persons
of Quality and Learning, to
attempt something further in
the <hi>Antiquities,</hi> and <hi>Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>
of <hi>Wales,</hi> than hath been
yet performed; and also find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my self more Inclin'd, and
(as I presume) better Qualified for an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that kind, than for any other: I have here
made bold to offer some Proposals towards such
a Design, to the end that if the Works above
mention'd may seem conducible to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Learning, and worthy of the Favour and
Encouragement of those amongst the Nobility
and Gentry, whom it more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
I may forthwith resolve on the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
or desist, in case they shall appear other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Historical</hi> and <hi>Geographical Dictionary,</hi> a
brief Account is design'd:</p>
            <p>I. Of all Persons memorable in the <hi>British</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
whether mention'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of our own Nation: And of all such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
as have written in <hi>British;</hi> whether <hi>Welch,
Cornish,</hi> or <hi>Armorican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Of all Places in <hi>Britain</hi> mention'd by the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> and of all Hundreds, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mots,
Towns, Castles, Villages, and Seats of the
Nobility and Gentry of chiefest Note now in
<hi>Wales:</hi> As also of the most Notable Mountains,
Rivers, Lakes; Barrows, Forts, Camps; and all
such places as either retain any Monuments of
Antiquity at present, or seem from their Names
to have had such heretofore. Throughout this
whole Work, an Interpretation of all such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Names, as are now intelligible, is intended;
with Conjectures concerning some of those which
are more obscure. And in this Part, 'tis pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd,
we may proceed with greater Security
here, than might be expected in most other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
For, whereas in other Parts, the Names
of Places have been so corrupted by Foreign Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
introduc'd by Conquest, that few of them
are now intelligible to the best Critics; <hi>Wales</hi>
has not been subject to such Changes, the Modern
<hi>British</hi> being probably one surviving Dialect of
the Language spoken by the first Inhabitants of
this Island. The End I propose herein, is, the
rectifying several Errors already committed in
the Interpreting the Names of Places in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and the preventing of many more in <hi>Wales</hi>
and <hi>Scotland;</hi> as also in some Places of <hi>England,</hi>
where the <hi>British</hi> Names, either entire or corrupt,
are still preserv'd. But we need not make any
Apology for Etymological Observations, since
<hi>Bochartus,</hi> Mr. <hi>Camden, Boxhornius, Ioannes Ger.
Vossius, AEgidius Menagius,</hi> and many other
Learned and Judicious Authors, have given the
World such ample Testimonies of their Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
provided they be cautiously handled, with
due regard to the Corruption of Languages, and
free from the Extravagancy of Fancy.</p>
            <p>The Essay entituled, <hi>Archaeologia Britannica,</hi> is
design'd to be divided into Four Parts.</p>
            <p>The First to contain, A Comparison of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>Welsh</hi> with other <hi>European</hi> Languages; more
especially with the <hi>Greek, Latin, Irish, Cornish,</hi>
and <hi>Armorican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:30343:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Second, A Comparison of the Customs
and Traditions of the <hi>Britans,</hi> with those of
other Nations.</p>
            <p>The Third, An Account of all such Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
now remaining in <hi>Wales,</hi> as are presum'd
to be <hi>British;</hi> and either older, or not much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest: <hi>viz.</hi> their Camps
and Burial-places; the Monuments called <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecheu,</hi>
and <hi>Meineu gwyr;</hi> their Coyns, Arms,
Amulets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth, An Account of the <hi>Roman</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities
there, and some others of later Date,
during the Government of the <hi>British</hi> Princes; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Copies of all the Inscriptions of any
considerable Antiquity, as yet remaining in that
Country.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Natural History</hi> may be divided into Five
Sections.</p>
            <p>The First whereof may contain, A General
Description of the Country, in respect of its Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
and Quality of the Soyl: An Account
of Meteors; with Comparative Tables of the
Weather in several places: Also of the Sea, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
Lakes, Springs, and Mineral Waters.</p>
            <p>§ 2. An Enumeration and Description of the
various sorts of Earths, Stones, and all Mineral
Bodies.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Of Form'd Stones; or such as have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and regular Figure, whereby they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishable
from each others, no less than Plants
or Animals.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Of Plants: wherein we shall only take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of such as grow spontaneously in <hi>Wales,</hi> and
have been rarely, or not at all, observ'd else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in this Island: adding a Catalogue of such
as are found in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> and have
not been observ'd in <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 5. Of Animals, in the same Method.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given a Scheme of what seems to
me at present, most likely to find Acceptance
amongst the Learned and Ingenious: But this I
offer with Submission to those of greater Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Experience; and shall be very ready,
in case I undertake the Performance, to admit of
any Alteration or Amendment (agreeable with
my Capacity) which they shall think fit to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend.</p>
            <p>Now in order to the Performance of what is
here propos'd, 'twill be necessary to travel <hi>Wales,</hi>
at least four or five Summers; and likewise to
make one Journey into <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Ireland,</hi> or the <hi>Highlands</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
Observations, as to their Language, their
Names of Towns, Rivers, Mountains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it
being certain, that the want of such actual Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying,
hath been in all Ages the occasion of much
Error and Ignorance in Writings of this nature.
During these Travels, I propose to my self the
collecting Materials for each Work; but shall
endeavour to prepare the <hi>Dictionary</hi> for the Press
within the space of five Years; and the <hi>Archaeolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>
within two Years after at farthest. As to the
<hi>Natural History,</hi> I can set no time for its Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as not being able to guess how tedious it may
prove, and having some thoughts of writing it in
<hi>Latin,</hi> and publishing it in several Sections apart.</p>
            <p>But before we engage in a Work so very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and expensive, it seems necessary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
what Encouragement we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon; since nothing of this kind hath been
undertaken (nor indeed could well succeed) in any
Country, without such an assurance. It's well
known, no kind of Writing requires more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
and Fatigue, than that of <hi>Natural History</hi>
and <hi>Antiquities:</hi> it being impossible to perform
any thing accurately in those Studies, without
much Travelling, and diligent Searching, as well
the most desert Rocks and Mountains, as the
more frequented Valleys and Plains. The Caves,
Mines, and Quarries must be pry'd into, as well
as the outward Surface of the Earth; nor must
we have less regard to the Creatures of the Sea,
Lakes, and Rivers, than those of the Air and
Dry Land. But 'tis not the Expences of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
we are only to regard; the Charges of
the Figures or Draughts of such new Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
as will occur, must needs be much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable:
not to mention, that a Correspondence
as extensive as we can settle it, must be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
with the Curious in these Studies; and
such new Books purchas'd, as are pertinent to
our Design; and that Labourers (especially in
Mines and Quarries) are to be rewarded for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
such things, as they shall be directed to
take Notice of.</p>
            <p>Upon these Considerations, I hope it will not
be thought profuse Liberality, (provided those
who are competent Judges approve of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign)
if an Annual Pension be allow'd towards it,
by such Gentlemen as are of their own free Choice
inclin'd to promote it, for the space of five Years:
The Money to be deliver'd on the First of <hi>March,</hi>
or any time that Month, into the Hands of some
Friends in each County, who are pleas'd to take
upon them the trouble of Returning it. And if
this Proposal finds Acceptance, my Request is,
That those Gentlemen who are pleas'd to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Undertaking, would subscribe their
Names to this Paper, adding how much they are
dispos'd to contribute Yearly. And if what is
subscrib'd, shall answer these Considerations,
my design is (with God's permission) to begin
Travelling next <hi>March.</hi> I am very sensible, that
such an Encouragement is above my Merits;
neither can I promise my Patrons a Performance
(if it please God I may live to go thorough with
it) any thing answerable to their Generosity: But
whatever shall be the Success, I intend not to
spare either Labour or Charges; and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
in no Profession, nor (by the favour of the
University) oblig'd to Personal Attendance in my
present Station, nor at all confin'd with the Care
of any Family, I shall have little else to mind, but
to endeavour the Performance of this Task to my
own Credit, and the Satisfaction of those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
who shall think fit to encourage me.</p>
