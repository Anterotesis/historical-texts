            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

LETTER,
Written upon the DISCOVERY
Of the Late
PLOT.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Heartily thank you for the News your last brought
me, of the discovery of that horrid Plot, both against
his Majesties Person, and the whole Kingdom. I
doubt not but all good men are offering up their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
to God, for so great a Blessing; which is
a fresh demonstration of his care of this Church, and State:
and that all our Crying sins have not provoked him yet
to abandon us: of which I pray God make us all sensible,
that we may not continue to pull down such judgments, as
the malice of wicked men would readily become instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in, if the Providence of God did not so wonderfully
and seasonably interpose.</p>
            <p>There is only one Passage in your Letter, that I wonder
at. You tell me every body is surprized with this Plot now
discovered. I confess I am not of their mind; for although
I know there are persons of high Honour, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted
Loyalty of the Roman Religion, who abominate
the thoughts of all secret Assassinations, much more of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40390:3"/>
Murdering his Majesty; yet such practices are so necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consequent to the Principles of that Church, that no
Member of it, who throughly understands them, can, while
they continue in that Communion, avoid the being involved
in Conspiracies, as oft as a sit occasion presents it self.</p>
            <p>These several years past they have boasted much of their
Loyalty, and their Services and Sufferings for his Majesty,
during the late Civil Wars. All this was necessary to make
the Government put confidence in them, that so they might
more secretly lay their designs: which were to take effect,
when a Conjuncture was offered that seemed favourable. But
I must again and again repeat, what I often told you in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
That no Member of that Church can thorowly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
and believe the Principles of it, and be a good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
even to a King of his own Perswasion: But he can be
much less so, to a Prince whom he looks on as an Heretick,
who thereby lies under a general Excommunication, and may
be brought under a particular and Formal one, before he,
or any body else, but such as are fit to be entrusted with
the Secret, shall know it: And then the Prince is at the
mercy of all his Popish Subjects, who if they consider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
the Doctrine of their own Church, must depart from
their Allegiance to Him, and be ready to do any thing
that is laid on them, by those who are either directly their
Superiours, if they have taken Religious Vows; or at least,
have some authority over their Consciences.</p>
            <p>This I shall open to you in as short and plain terms as is
possible; and the rather, that you may communicate it to
some persons of Honour of that Religion, who I hope up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so fresh a Discovery of these practices, may be now not
unwilling to examine a Point, the consideration of which
they before rejected, as an Imputation cast on their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This will now, I imagine, move them so far to demur,
as to consider impartially whether such practises flow only
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40390:3"/>
from the ill Tempers of particular Persons, or from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Principles of their Church. This latter I undertake
to make out, from the undeniable Maximes, to which all
of that Communion are bound to adhere.</p>
            <p>There are Two Principles, which I may well call the
Fundamental Principles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: since all
Opinions that are not inconsistent with them, can be tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
among them: But whatever strikes at these, must
needs be Abominated, as Destructive of that, they call <hi>The
Catholick Faith.</hi> The one is, <hi>The Authority of the Church,</hi>
The other is, <hi>The Certainty of Tradition.</hi> If then the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Deposing Kings, and by consequence Killing them
(for if they are justly deposed, it's as just to kill them as to
kill any Usurper) is such, that without denying the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church, and the Certainty of Tradition, it
cannot be denied; then all men must resolve either to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
it, or to renounce their Subjection to a Church
that must needs believe it.</p>
            <p>About the Authority of the Church, Two things are to
be observed, that serve for clearing what I design to make
out.</p>
            <p>The First is, That the Church in any one Age has as
much Authority as ever it had, or can have in any other
Age: For if Christs Promises, together with the other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
they bring for the Authority of the Church, be
good, they are alike strong at all Times, and in all Ages:
And therefore though in writing Books of Controversies
they muster up Authorities out of the former Ages, because
we profess we pay little esteem to the latter Ages: Yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves all Ages are alike, and the Decrees of
them are of equal authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Authority of the Church is as little to be
disputed in moral matters, that fall under practice, as in
Articles of Faith that only fall under Speculation, and in a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40390:4"/>
word, The Church must be the Infallible Expounder of
the Ten Commandments, as well as of the Creed. All
the Arguments from Christs Promises, from the hazard of
trusting to our private Reasonings, and the Necessity of
Submitting to a publick Judg, are by so much the more
concluding in Practical matters, as it is of more Importance,
That Men think aright in Practical than in Speculative
Opinions. If then there arises a Question about a Moral
matter, or the Exposition of any of the Commandments,
The only certain Decision must be expected from the
Church. For instance, a Question arises about Images,
Whether it is lawful to use them in the Worship of God,
upon the seeming Opposition which the worship of them has
to the 2d Commandment? Since the Church has once De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
that it may be lawfully used, it is Heresie to deny
it, on this pretence, that we fancy it is contrary to one of
the Commandments. So if a Controversie arise upon the
Fifth Commandment, How far a King is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
if the Church has determined the Limits of that,
it is Heresie to carry it further. If also another Question
arise how much the Sixth Commandment obliges? It must
be carried so far and no further than the Determination of
the Church allows. I confess by the Doctrine of that
Church, even a General Council may err in a point in
which any matter of Fact is included: Because they may be
deceived by a false Information. But in a General Rule
about Morality, and the Extent of any of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
The Decision of the Church must either be
certain, and for ever Obligatory, or the whole Doctrine of
the Infallibility of the Church falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Certainty of Tradition,</hi> the general Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that party, is, That Tradition is an Infallible Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Divine Truth: and that whatever any Age of the
Church delivers to another as derived from Christ and his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40390:4"/>
Apostles, must be received with the same Veneration and
Obedience that we pay to the Holy Scriptures. And for
the ways of distinguishing a Tradition of the Church from
any Imposture, or Novelty: There be four of them.</p>
            <p>The first, That is the most doubtful, is, That the greatest
and most esteemed Doctors in any Age deliver as a Divine
Truth. Nor is it necessary that they formally say, This is
a Tradition: but if many of them mention an Opinion, and
declare their own assent to it, this passes as a sufficient proof
of the Tradition of any Age of the Church. So in all points
of Controversie between them and us, the greatest part of
their Writers, (some few later and suspected ones only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
think they have sufficiently justified their Church,
when they bring Testimonies out of any of the Writings of
the Fathers, that seem to favour their Opinion: and will
call it unreasonable for us to reject these, because they only
deliver their own opinion, and do not call it the Tradition
of the Church, but conclude, That many Writers in any
age asserting an Opinion, it may well be looked on as the
Tradition of that Age.</p>
            <p>But, because this is more liable to exception, there is
another way, that is more infallible to judg of Tradition:
and that is, by the conveyance of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
they judg the chief Depository of the Faith; and for which
they fansie they have so many proofs, from the high things
some of the Fathers have said about the dignity of that
See. Now if these conclude any thing, it must follow,
That whatever has been delivered in any Age by a Pope,
as conveyed down from Christ, or his Apostles, must either
be so indeed, or the See of <hi>Rome</hi> is not a faithful Transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Tradition.</p>
            <p>But, there is yet a more certain way of judging of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by what the chief Pastors of the Church have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
when assembled in a general Council. This being the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40390:5"/>
Supreme Tribunal in the Church, there can lie no appeal
from it: Nor can the Doctrines delivered or approved by
it be questioned. For instance, If it were under debate,
How the Tradition about Transubstantiation can be made
out in the Thirteenth Century; it is needless to seek any other
evidence, than, That one <hi>Almerick</hi> is condemned for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and in Opposition to that, it was formally establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a general Council. This is as much as can be had, and
he were very unreasonable that were not satisfied with it:
So if it be asked, How can the Tradition of the Doctrine of
Deposing Kings, and giving away their Dominions in the
same Century be proved? The Answer is plain, That same
very Council decreed it: Upon which a great Prince was
deposed, and his Dominions were given to another.</p>
            <p>These are the Common Standards by which Traditions are
Examined. But to these a new one has been lately added:
which is indeed a much shorter and nearer way: And that
is, whatever the Church holds in any one age, as a Material
point of Religion, she must have received it from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
age, and that age from the former, and so it climbs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
till the days of the Apostles. If this be a certain
Track of Tradition by which we may infallibly trace it;
Then for instance, If in any one age, it hath been believed,
That St. <hi>Peter</hi> had power from Christ, which he left to the
See of <hi>Rome,</hi> by which his Successor in it can depose Kings,
then this must be an Apostolical Tradition, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of equal authority with any thing written in the
Scriptures.</p>
            <p>To these General Considerations about the Authority of
the Church, and the Certainty of Tradition; I shall add
Two other, about the Nature of Supreme and Soveraign
Power: By which we may judg of what Extent the Popes
Power must be, if he have an authority to depose Kings,
and transfer their Dominions to other persons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40390:5"/>
First, When the Soveraign Powers proceed in a Legal
way against its Subjects; If either they abscond, so that they
cannot be found; Or have such a Power about them, that
the Sovereign cannot bring them to punishment; He may
declare them Rebels, and set Prices on their Heads; And in
that case it is as lawful for any Subject to kill them, as it is
for an Executioner to put a condemned Person to Death.
These being the several ways the Law provides in those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
cases. So when a <hi>Pope</hi> deposes a Prince, He may as
lawfully set on private Assassinates to kill him, as oblige his
Subjects to rise with open force against him. For if the <hi>Pope</hi>
has a Power over him to depose him; this clearly follows
from the Nature of Sovereign Power, and it is the Course
that sometimes must be followed, when the Rebel can be no
other way brought to deserved punishment; and if the
<hi>Pope</hi> has the power of deposing, then a Prince who after
such a Sentence, carries himself as a King, is a Rebel against
his Supreme Lord: And is also an Usurper. For his Title
being destroyed by the Sentence, He has no authority over
his Subjects: and therefore may be as lawfully killed as any
Rebel or Usurper.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Supreme power may in cases of great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
when the thing is in it self materially just, pass over
such Forms as ought in ordinary Cases to be observed. I
need not tell you, That in a great Fire, Subordinate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
may blow up Houses. But doubtless the Supreme
Power of all, as a King in an absolute Monarchy (and such is
the Papal Power if these Opinions be true) may dispence with
some Forms, when the Matter is in it self just; and if the chief
design of a Law be pursued, the circumstantial parts of it
may upon extraordinary occasions be superseded: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if the <hi>Pope</hi> is Supreme over all Kings, and has this
deposing Power; Then though by the Canon, a King
ought to be first a Year Excommunicated for his Heresy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40390:6"/>
or favouring Hereticks; and at the Years end he may be
Deposed by the Pope, (There are also other Rules for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications,
tho the Summary way in some cases may
be used) yet all these are but circumstantial and lesser Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The design of that Law, is, That no Heretical
Prince, or favourer of Heresie, be continued in his Power;
The other, are but Forms of Law, that cannot be indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
necessary in all cases. Besides, the very Canon Law
teaches, that when there is both a <hi>Notorietas juris &amp; Facti,</hi>
Summary proceedings are Legal; when then it is Notorious,
that the Doctrines of the Church (of <hi>England</hi> for Instance)
are Heretical, and that the King is an Obstinate Favourer
of these Heresies, and will not extirpate them, Summary
and Secret proceedings are justifiable. There is no hope that
Bulls, Breves, or Citations would do any good in this
case: These would on the contrary, alarm the State, and
bring all the Party under great hazards: Therefore from
the Nature of Supreme Power, it is most justly Inferred,
That though there have been no publick Sentence of Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
(according to the Forms of the Canon Law) yet all
these may be dispensed with, and a Secret and Summary
one may do as well.</p>
            <p>These Positions are such, that I cannot fansie any just
Exceptions to which they are liable; and from all these laid
together, the Inference will undeniably follow: That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the power
of Deposing Kings is lodged with the Pope, by a Divine
Authority; and that, by consequence, private persons may
conspire to take away the Life of a King so deposed: Even
though there be no publick Sentence given about it. But
before I bring the Evidence for all this, I shall desire the
Reader will a little reflect on the Positions I have laid down:
in which he will find an Answer to all the Exceptions, that
can be made against the following Evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40390:6"/>
By the first, The Authority of the Church, being the
same in all Ages; he will see it is to no purpose to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
these were dark Ages: So that what was done in an
ignorant time, cannot oblige the World when things are
seen in a better light. But if the Church has an Authority
from Christ, that shall last till the end of the World, it must
be the same in all ages. The Ignorance of the age is a very
good answer when made by a Protestant, but can signifie
nothing in a <hi>Papists</hi> Mouth.</p>
            <p>By the second, Of the Churches authority in setling Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rules for practice, it appears how fond that distinction
is, which they make between a Canon and a Decree. It is
true, a Decree about a particular Case, in which there is
some matter of Fact, may be wrong according to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and yet the authority of the Church remain entire.
For instance, in the deposing a Prince, or condemning a
Man for Heresie, the Church may either by false Witnesses,
or mistaking a Man's words, be drawn to pass an unjust
Sentence, by reason of a mis representation of the Fact. But
that is nothing to the purpose here, where a Decree is made
as a perpetual Rule of Practice; this must be of the same
authority of a Canon about any article of Faith. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it will follow, that the Church may mislead the People
in matters indispensably necessary to Salvation: For such is
the Obedience to the Ten Commandments.</p>
            <p>By the first way of judging of the Tradition of the
Church, from what the most received Writers in any age
deliver, as the Doctrine of the Church, it will appear; That
the Schoolmen and Canonists are as competent Conveyers
of Tradition from the twelfth age downward, as the Fathers
were from the sixth Age upward; and laying this for a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
That the Church is the same in all Ages, they are
really more competent Witnesses than the Fathers were.
First, Because they write more closely to the subject they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40390:7"/>
have in hand; they consider what is said for, or against an
Opinion in a more exact manner, than the Fathers did, who
being carried with the heat they are sometimes in, go off
from the purpose: and generally affect Eloquence, which is
the most improper Stile for nice Matters: Whereas the
Schoolmen write in a blunt way, only considering the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they are about, coyning the most barbarous words
they can light on, when they think them the fittest to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their Notions. Secondly, They were divided into two
famous Schools, among whom there were great heats, the
<hi>Scotists</hi> and <hi>Thomists:</hi> So that if either of these had asserted
any thing that was not the received Doctrine of the Age
they lived in, the other Party had such Emulation against
them, that they would not have failed to have laid them
open: as they did in the matter of the Immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Virgin. Whereas the Fathers writing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against Hereticks, or other Enemies to Christianity, they
might have mistaken some things, without so publick a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
as was likely to happen among the Schoolmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
3dly. The Schoolmen wrote on purpose to deliver the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Age</hi> in which they lived, to those who were to
succeed them. Their Books being generally the Divinity
Lectures they read, either in Colledges or Religious Houses,
to their Scholars, whereas the Fathers wrote upon Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Occasions, either Letters or Treatises to private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
regarding more the present, than the succeeding Age.
In which we cannot expect that exactness, that is to be
looked for in a Publick Lecture. Upon all which I assume,
That allowing the Church to have the same Authority in
all <hi>Ages,</hi> the Schoolmen are more competent Witnesses of
the Tradition of the Church in their <hi>Ages,</hi> than the Fathers
were in theirs.</p>
            <p>By the second Rule for judging of Traditions, from the
Conveyance of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> it does undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40390:7"/>
That the Popes from <hi>Gregory</hi> the Sevenths time
downward, were as sure <hi>Depositories</hi> of the Traditions of
the Church, as were the Popes from <hi>Gregory</hi> the First his
time upward. They were both alike Christ's Vicars, and
St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successors. So that all the high words that the
Fathers bestow on the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> were either Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
in which they are not wanting, or were said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the worth of the Bishops, whom they had known
in that See. But if they be to be understood in that
sence in which the Writers of Controversy obtrude them
on us, then it will follow manifestly, that as to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of Tradition, P. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th is as much to be
believed, when he says any thing in the Name of <hi>St. Peter,</hi>
or of Christ, as any of the Popes are. For in the
Preamble of Bulls and Breeves, the Reasons are given of
what follows, which are most commonly vouched from
Apostolical Authority and Tradition. So let the Pope be
ever so ignorant, or so corrupt in his Manners, what he
asserts to be Apostolical Tradition, must be either received
as such, or the authority of that See is overthrown: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they must either cease to press us any more with tht <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> or acknowledg that all the Popes
Declarations, which they make about Traditions, are to be
received. It is an Answer to be made use of only to ignorant
Persons, to say, These <hi>Depositions</hi> were the Deeds of some
Popes, who might be ill Men, and the Church is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to justify them. I confess, whether this or that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
was justly or lawfully made, is a personal thing, in
which only the Pope who decreed it is concerned. But
if he declares in the Preamble, that the Power of depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
upon those reasons, is grounded on an <hi>Apostolical</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then the See is concerned in it: for either he declares
true or false; if the former, then that Power of deposing
comes from <hi>Apostolical Tradition;</hi> if they acknowledge
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40390:8"/>
he declares false, then we are not any more to be urged with
the Authority of that See, as the certain Depository of the
Traditions of the Church.</p>
            <p>By the third Mark, to judge of the Tradition of any age
from the Decision of a General Council, it appears, that the
Decisions of the fourth Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> are as Obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as the Decrees of the first Council of <hi>Nice:</hi> the Church
having the same power in all Ages. If it be said, it was
only a Council of the Western Church, the like may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against the first General Council, which were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made up of Eastern Bishops, and very few of the Western
Bishops sat in them. And if we esteem a Council <hi>General,</hi>
because it was received by the Church, then the whole
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> having received that Council, it must be
acknowledged to be <hi>General</hi> as much as any ever was. But
to this, others answer, That a Council is only Infallible,
when a thing is decreed by it according to the Tradition
of the Church. If this be true, the whole Controversie
between the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and us, about the authority of
Councils, is decided on our Side. For if a Council has
only authority to declare Traditions, then it is free for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Person to examine, whether this Declaration be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to truth or not? And if it be found that it is not so,
they may lawfully reject such Decisions. For instance in
the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the worship of Images was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
upon a mock-shew of Tradition: and yet all
the World knows, there were no Images allowed in the
Church the first four Ages after <hi>Christ;</hi> and even in the
sixth Age P. <hi>Gregory</hi> declared, That though they might be
in the Church, yet they ought not to be worshipped. Nor
was there any contest about it, before the eighth Century.
This being thus examined, and found to be True, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the foregoing Answer, that Decision was of no
force, though made by the second Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> In a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40390:8"/>
word, if this Maxime be true, That Councils are only
to be submitted to, when they decree according to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Tradition, then they have no Authority in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
and their decisions can have no more force than
this, That it may seem probable that they were not mistaken,
and in an Ignorant Age, even this probability will vanish to
nothing.</p>
            <p>No Body will reject the Decision of a Council, when the
Decrees are just and right: But if it be upon that score a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
that they are to be submitted to, then none are bound
by them, before they have examined them: And if upon a
Search it appear they decreed against Tradition, then their
Decrees are to be rejected. So it is apparent this Answer
does plainly, according to their Principles, lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all Heresie; since it gives every Man a right to
question the Decrees of a General Council.</p>
            <p>Besides, How can those Persons be assured, that the
fourth Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> did not decree according to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
The Acts of that Council are lost: so we cannot
know upon what reasons they made their Decrees. And it
cannot be said, that because there is no mention made of any
Tradition in the Decree, that therefore they considered none.
It is seldom found that the reasons of any Decree are put
with it. But we may reasonably enough believe, that they
followed the Method in this Council, that had been used
in some former ones (particularly in the second Council of
<hi>Nice</hi>) which was this, a Writing was read, penned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
by the Pope, or a Patriarch, in which the Tradition
of the Church was confidently alledged; and some Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
were brought; and very oft out of some later Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The Paper was no sooner read, than a loud and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
repeated Shout of applause followed, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
search or canvasing about these Authorities. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that the Decree was made. This was the practice both
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40390:9"/>
of the second <hi>Nicene,</hi> and of some more ancient Councils;
whose Journals are hitherto preserved; and where the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
are lost, we have reason to believe they followed the same
method: so that it is very probable there might have been
some such Writing read in the Council of <hi>Lateran.</hi> And if
they did not found their Decree upon Tradition, they were
much to blame; for they had as venerable a Tradition, as either
the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> or some other Councils had:
a practiee about 150 years standing from the days of <hi>Pope
Gregory</hi> the VII. so that it is not to be denied but they had
as good authority from Tradition, to make this Decree, as
to make most of the other Decrees, on which they insist
much, in the Books of Controversies that are written by
them.</p>
            <p>By the fourth Rule of judging about Tradition, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is yet much plainer: for if the generally received Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of any Age of the Church, is a good Thread to lead
us up to the Apostles times, then there needs no more
be said. For it is certain, that for near four Ages together,
this was the universally received Doctrine of the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the opposition that some Princes made to
it was condemned as Heresy, Rebellion, and every thing
that was evil. And it is remarkable, that both <hi>Ockam</hi> that
wrote much for the Emperors cause against the <hi>Pope,</hi> and
<hi>Gerson</hi> and <hi>Almain,</hi> no great favourers of Papal power,
are cited by Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> as acknowledging the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
power of deposing, if a Prince were guilty of spiritual
crimes. So that the Controversies in this matter that were
managed between the Writers for the Popes and Emperors,
were not, whether the Pope in cases of Heresy might depose
a Prince? but were concerning two things very remote from
this.</p>
            <p>The one was, whether the Pope had a direct Temporal
power over all Kings, by which as being Lord of the Fee, he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40390:9"/>
could proceed upon any Cause whatsoever against a
King, and take his Dominions from him. To this indeed
<hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> pretended tho more covertly, and <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
the <hi>8th</hi> more avowedly. There was great Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made to this by many Writers; but at the same time
they all agreed on it, as an undeniable Maxim, That the
Pope had an indirect Power over Princes, by which in
the Cases of Heresy he might excommunicate and depose
them; nor was there so much as any Debate about it.</p>
            <p>A second thing about which there was some Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
was, whether the Particulars that fell under debate
came within the Head of Heresy, or not? So in the
Case of Princes giving the Investitures into Bishopricks,
the Pope brought it in within the Head of Heresy, and
condemned those Persons as <hi>Simoniacks.</hi> The Writers on
the other side denied this, pretending it was a Civil Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and a right of the Crown. The like Debates fell
in, when Princes were sentenced on any other account.
The Authority of the Sentence in the Case of Heresy was
not controverted; all the Question was; Whether the
Point under debate was Heresy or not? And concerning
these things, any who have read the Writings in the great
Collection made of them by <hi>Goldastus,</hi> will receive an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
and full Satisfaction. By which it appears, that the
Popes Power of deposing Kings in the Case of Heresy was
the received Doctrine of the Church for several Ages, and
by consequence it must be looked on as derived down
from the Apostles, If the Doctrine of any one Age of
the Church can lead us backward in a certain Track to
discover what it was in the Apostles days.</p>
            <p>By the first Position about the Nature of Supreme
Power, it is apparent, that in the Case of Heresy, a Prince
deposed by the Pope, if he stands out against the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
may be as lawfully killed as any Tory or Moss-Trooper,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40390:10"/>
or Bantito, may be; for he is a Rebel against
his Lord, and an Usurper over the People, from that day
forward. And therefore tho <hi>Mariana</hi> told a Secret too
publickly, yet it cannot be denied to be a certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of their Principles. It had been indeed more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
done to have ordered this only to be infused un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Peoples Consciences, by their Confessors in secret. And
for <hi>Mariana,</hi> tho the Book in gross is condemned, as they
give out, yet the Opinions set down in it are not censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

               <hi>Foulis</hi> cites
ten more Doctors for the same Opinion of killing Kings
by private persons.</p>
            <p>I do not build upon the Assertions of these Jesuits, as
binding Authorities in that Church, but make use of
them to shew, that some of their own eminentest Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
acknowledg the force of this Consequence; which
is indeed so evident, that nothing but good Manners,
and some small Care not to provoke Princes too much
by such bare-faced Positions, keeps others from asserting
it. Few Princes are so tame as <hi>Childeric</hi> was, to go into
a Monastery after they are deposed. Therefore this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is but a lame provision for the Churches Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from Heresie, if the Lawfulness of killing does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that of deposing Kings. And it was so generally
received, that it is told of <hi>Gerson,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Life of <hi>Gerson</hi> before his Works, <hi>and Tom. 1. p.</hi> 375.</note> that he was at great
pains to get it declared that no private Cut-throat
might kill a King, and that by consequence it was only
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40390:10"/>
the Popes Prerogative to order them to be destroyed.</p>
            <p>By the second Position about the Nature of Supreme
Power, that in extraordinary Cases Forms of Law may
be superseded; It is also clear, that tho we know nothing
of any Sentence of Deposition given out against the
King, yet he is not a whit the safer, for he lies under an
yearly Curse every <hi>Maundy Thursday.</hi> The Notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Heresy will sufficiently justify a particular
Sentence, without any further Process or Citation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Maxims of the Canon Law. And there
may be for ought we can know, as valid a Deposition
as Parchment and Lead can make it, already expeded.
And if it be not yet done, we are sure it may be done
very suddenly, and will be done whensoever they see
any probability of Success.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath very sincerely told us the Reason why
Heretical Princes are not deposed,<note place="margin">Recog. in lib. 5. de Rom. Pont.</note> because the Church
has not strength enough to make such a Sentence good,
or does not think it expedient; that is to say, They
will do it whensoever they find a Prince who will exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the Sentence, and yet by that Conquest not grow
so strong, as by that means to turn the Ballance. So the
two Considerations to which we owe our Security are,
the want of Force, and the Fear of another Prince his
becoming too powerful by the Conquest. But I must add,
that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> while he was a Jesuite, had taught, that
Heretical Princes were not to be deposed, except they
endeavoured to turn their people from the Faith: This
was all his Bounty to them of which we could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to a Crumb, since there were such Laws made against
Popery among us. Yet when he became a Cardinal, he
considered better of the Matter; so that in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitions
he retracts that, and says therein be followed
<hi>Durandus</hi> his Opinion, who maintains it against <hi>Aquinas,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40390:11"/>
but he thinks the latter was in the right, and says, <hi>Even
in that Case they may be deposed, only the Church does it
not always; either because she wants Strength, or does not
judge it expedient.</hi> But he concludes, <hi>If Princes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to draw their Subjects from the Faith, they may and
ought to be deposed.</hi> So in our Case there is no Mercy to
be expected, unless we repeal all Laws against that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>But after all this there is another Device in the Canon-Law,
called, <hi>Ipso facto,</hi> by which a Sentence is incurred
immediately upon the doing of a Fact. This began in the
Priviledges granted to Monasteries or Churches, in most
of which this Clause is to be found, <hi>That if any King or
Prince,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did any thing contrary to these Priviledges, he
thereby fell from his Power and Dignity.</hi> Now that Heresy
is one of the things upon which a Prince is <hi>ipso facto</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Excommunication and Deposition, we have the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Father<note n="e" place="margin">Philopater p. 106, 107.</note> 
               <hi>Parsons,</hi> or <hi>Creswel,</hi> who tells us, <hi>That
the whole School of Divines and Canonists agree in it,</hi> and,
<hi>That it is certain, and of Faith, That a Prince falling from
the Catholick Religion, and endeavouring to draw away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
from it, does immediately fall from all his Power and
Dignity, even before the Pope has pronounced any Sentence,
and that his Subjects are free from their Oaths of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and may eject such an one as Apostate and Heretick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a clearer Evidence for this; the great and
famous College of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> (seventy Doctors being
present) when consulted, whether the People of <hi>France</hi>
were not freed from their Obedience to <hi>Henry</hi> the third,
upon his putting the Duke and Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi> to
death; they, before ever the Pope had given Sentence,
declared, <hi>That they were absolved from their Obedience, and
might with a good Conscience make War upon him for the
defence of the Catholick Faith.</hi> Upon which the <hi>Parisians</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:40390:11"/>
wrote to the Pope to desire the Confirmation of that
Decision. From all which it appears, that if the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Power be in the Pope, the King is not a whit the
safer, because we know nothing of any such Sentence
pronounced against him.</p>
            <p>And thus having made good and illustrated the Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
I laid down, against all the Exceptions which that
small and condemned Party of <hi>Widdrington</hi>'s Followers
make use of, to cover themselves from the Charge of
Treason, that lies against their Church; I go next to
lay open the Evidence, after which I shall leave it to
every Man's Conscience to pass the Verdict.</p>

            <p>About 130 years after that, Pope<note n="g" place="margin">Baron. ad An. 730. n. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>3d</hi>
deposed <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperor, from all his Dominions in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40390:12"/>
               <hi>Italy,</hi> because he would not tolerate the Worship of I,
mages. And if that single Heresie merited such a Sentence
what may we look for, among whose many imputed Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
this is but one, and none of the most considerable?
Not many years after that, did his Successor <hi>Zacharias</hi>
upon a Message he received from <hi>France,</hi> absolve that
Nation from their Oaths to <hi>Childeric,</hi> and ordered <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
to Crown <hi>Pepin</hi> in his stead And not long after that
Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> gave the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the West
to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great. As<note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellar.</hi> de Trans Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii Romani.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> proves from above
30 of the Historians of that time, and the Testimony of
many Soveraign Princes. Yet these being dark Ages, in
which there was more of Action than Dispute, we do
not find the Grounds laid down, on which those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
were founded. But the constant Maxim of the
Papacy, was, once to begin a Practice, and then to find
Arguments to defend it, among which the Practice it
self was no inconsiderable one; for he was a mean spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
Pope, that would in a Title fall short of what his
Predecessors had assumed. About 250 years after <hi>Charles</hi>
the Great had assumed the Empire of the West, there
arose a Pope (<hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh) that resolved to
make the most of his See that could be: and reckoning,
That the Empire of the West was the <hi>Gift</hi> of his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors,</hi>
and building on that known Maxim, That
none can give that which they have not, he looked on
the supreme Dominion of it, as one of the Perquisites of
the See, which he would by no means part with. And
therefore in his<note n="i" place="margin">Dictatus l. 2. post Ep. 55.</note> 
               <hi>Dictatis,</hi> in which he asserts the
several Branches of his Prerogative, these be three of
them: <hi>That the Pope only may use the Imperial Ensigns.
That he may depose Emperours.</hi> And, <hi>That he can absolve
Subjects from their Fidelity to wicked Princes.</hi> And to
shew he was in earnest in these Doctrines, he began soon
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40390:12"/>
to lay about him. His first Threatnings were against
King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who was a vicious Prince: In a
Letter to the Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> he requires them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
the King for his Faults, and if he did not mend
them, to put the whole Kingdom under an Interdict:
And if after all that he continued still Disobedient, he
Swaggers out in these Words,<note n="k" place="margin">Lib 2. Ep 5. ad Ep. France.</note> 
               <hi>We will have none to
be ignorant, or doubtful, what we intend to do upon it; for
by the help of God we will endeavour by all Means, to wrest
the Kingdom of</hi> France <hi>out of his Possession.</hi> But upon the
submission of that King, these Threatnings came not to
any effect: Yet he went on against the Emperor, <hi>Hen.</hi> the
<hi>4th,</hi> at the rate he had threatned the King of <hi>France.</hi> I
need not tell what all the World knows: That he first Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
and Deposed the Emperor, in the Year
1076. Then upon his doing of Penance, he received him
into his Favour. But upon new provocations he depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him a second, a third, and fourth time, in the years
1080, 1081, and 1083. In all which he had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of so many <hi>Roman</hi> Councils, and set up against
him, first <hi>Rodolph,</hi> after that <hi>Herman:</hi> as his Successors
did; first <hi>Conrade,</hi> and then <hi>Henry,</hi> that Emperor's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Sons.</p>
            <p>The prosecution of the History, is needless to my
Design. But in his Letter to <hi>Herman,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mets,</hi>
               <note n="l" place="margin">Liv. 8. Ep. 21.</note> we meet with that which is more considerable. For
there he largely justifies his Proceedings, which he
grounds on the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, being
given to St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and the power of Binding and Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
joined to them. More places of Scripture he sought
not, but his Successor,<note n="m" place="margin">Extra. de Major. &amp; Obed cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> made use
of <hi>Ecce duo Gladii,</hi> and the power given to the Prophet
<hi>Jeremiah, Over Kingdoms, to Root out, Pull down, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,
Throw down, to Build, and to plant:</hi> And they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40390:13"/>
took it in great dudgeon, if any would compare a single
Prophet under the Law, to Christ's Vicar under the
Gospel. But <hi>Gregory</hi> goes on in his Proofs, to the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Church: And says, The Fathers had often
both in General Councils, and in their particular Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
acknowledged, That this Power was in the See of
<hi>Rome;</hi> That it was the Mother and Head of all other
Churches: That all matters were to be judged by it,
from whose Sentence no Appeal could lye: Nor could
there be a Review made of the Judgments passed in that
See. And to confirm what he had asserted, he cites
some Passages out of <hi>Gelasius,</hi> and <hi>Julius,</hi> and that
Clause in the Priviledges granted by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great,
formerly mentioned. So here he very fully and formally
delivers the Tradition of the Church, and builds upon
it. He also cites the Precedent of Pope <hi>Zacharias,</hi> his
Deposing <hi>Childeric,</hi> not for any fault he found in him,
but because he thought him not fit to Govern. From
that he goes on to some Reasons, (such as they are)
for the justification of his Proceedings. The Pope
having thus declared the Tradition and Doctrine of the
Church, it is not to be wondered at, if both the Schoolmen
mixt it with the Instructions they gave their Scholars,
and the Canonists made it a part of the Law of the
Church.<note n="n" place="margin">

               <hi>Boniface</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> thought his Predecessors
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40390:13"/>
had proceeded in this matter too cautiously, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he went more roundly to work. In the Jubilee in
the year 1300, He shewed himself the first day in the
Pontifical Habit, but the second day, he was clothed with
the Imperial Habit, a naked Sword being carried before
him, and cried out with a loud voice, <hi>I am Pope and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
and have both the Earthly, and Heavenly Empire.</hi> This
upon so publick an occasion looks very like the Teaching
the Church <hi>Ex Cathedra:</hi> But because words vanished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Air, he left it in writing, in these terms:<note n="p" place="margin">Cap. de Major. ut O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Exter.</note> 
               <hi>We say
and define and pronounce, that it is absolutely necessary to
Salvation for every humane creature, to be subject to the
Bishop of Rome.</hi> This being put into the Text of the
Canon Law, in which it is continued to this day; we
cannot think it Strange that <hi>Panorimitan, Ostiensis, Silve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
with all the other Canonists assert the Popes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Dominion over all the World. And what can they
say less, Believing him to be Christs Vicar on Earth, <hi>to
whom all Power in heaven and earth was given of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
therefore the power in Heaven being judged enough
for Christ to manage himself, they thought all the power
in Earth was Committed to the Vicar. This passed
down without Contradiction among them, but was not
received by the rest of the Church: yet the Indirect, or
as they termed it, the Ecclesiastical power in cases of
Heresie was Universally agreed to: not one person Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it, till <hi>Luther</hi> and his Followers came, sawcily to
look into the Popes Title to this, and many other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Rights of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because the Plea for an Indirect Power, was not
Sufficient, Since if a Prince did not Favour Heresie, it
was of no use: And the pretention to a direct power was
of an harsh sound: Therefore a Title of another kind
was set up. It was pretended, That all the Kingdoms
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40390:14"/>
in the Western and Northern parts of <hi>Europe</hi> were by
formal Surrenders offered up to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul;</hi>
And therefore whatever the Popes did, was said to be
done in Defence of their Rights; which made <hi>Gregory</hi>
the 7th fly to them in that flanting Address, with which
he begins his Sentences against the Emperor.</p>
            <p>First of all, the Donation of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great was
forged: By which the Power of all the West, <hi>Italy, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,
Sardinia, Germany, France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>
were given to the Pope. This was put into the Text of
the Canon Law: and was stood to, by all the Canonists.
It is true the Civilians wrote generally against it. Among
whom <hi>Bartholus</hi> may be reckoned, for in his Preface to
the <hi>Digests</hi> having mentioned the Opinions of some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, when it comes to his own, he delivers it thus;
<hi>Take notice that we are now in the Territory of the Church</hi>
(for he taught at <hi>Bulloigne) and therefore I say that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
is valid.</hi> But till <hi>Valla</hi> discovered the Impostures
of it so manifestly, that they are now ashamed to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it any longer, their plea from it was never laid down.
But <hi>Augustinus Steuchus,</hi> who undertakes the Vindication
of that Donation against <hi>Valla,</hi> does likewise alledge
from some Instruments in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> that both the
Kingdoms of <hi>Spain, Arragon, France, England, Denmark,
Muscovy, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Croatia</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> did Subject their
Crowns to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">In Vandal l. 8. c. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Krantzius</hi> tells us, that
<hi>Lakold</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> made it Tributary to <hi>Rome.</hi> And
for the <hi>German</hi> Empire, tho <hi>Steuchus</hi> says nothing of it,
perhaps that he might not offend <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th, yet
there is both in the Canon Law, and the Letters of Popes,
more to be said upon that Head, than for any of the rest.
They pretend the Popes set up first the Empire of the
West: Then gave the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> the Right
of choosing the Emperor, and does still give the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40390:14"/>
Crown, upon the Emperors Swearing an Oath of
Homage to them, according to the verse under that Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Picture set up by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 2d. In the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>
               <note n="r" place="margin">Chron. Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saug. in vita Abb. Harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingi.</note> of the Emperor lying prostrate at his feet, and
receiving the Crown from him.</p>
            <q>Post homo fit Papae, sumit quo dante Coronam.</q>
            <p>But all these Surrenders were made use of only to
strengthen the great pretention they had of being Christs
Vicars, and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Successours; which from the end
of the 11th Century, till the beginning of the 16th. for
above 4 Ages together was as Authoritatively asserted by
Popes, as positively taught by Divines, and as tamely
received by the whole Church, Emperors and Kings not
presuming to contradict it, as any other Article of Faith.
And for proofs of this we need appeal to no other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
than those 3. great Cardinals <hi>Baronius, Bellarmin</hi>
and <hi>Perron,</hi> who may be presumed to have understood
the Doctrine of their own Church, better than any body
else.</p>
            <p>The First of those, through his whole work strains his
Industry, to discover as many Instances as he can of it:
and never parts with any without expressing the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
satisfaction he had in so pleasant a Discovery. I shall
only set down what he says on the two 1st. occasions that
he met with. When he takes notice of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great's
priviledges formerly mentioned, he adds,<note n="s" place="margin">Bar. ad Ann. 593. Num. 86.</note> 
               <hi>You see Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
That the Popes can make Laws, to which if Kings
themselves do not yield Obedience, they shall lose their
Kingdoms.</hi> Upon the first Deposition m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de by <hi>Gregory</hi>
the 3d. He adds,<note n="t" place="margin">Bar. ad An. 730. Num. 5.</note> 
               <hi>The Faithful in the West being awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by this Thunder, do immediately fall from the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to</hi> Leo, <hi>adhering to this Apostolical Pope. So this</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:40390:15"/>
Gregory <hi>left a worthy Precedent to Posterity, that Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Princes, be not suffered to reign in the Church of Christ,
if having been often admonished, they continue to persist
obstinately in their Errors.</hi> Such strains as these do so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
occur afterwards, that they can scarce be reckoned.
It is well known what advice he gave P. <hi>Paul</hi> the 5th in
the quarrel with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> applying the voice to St.
<hi>Peter, Arise and Kill,</hi> to the case in hand; and that, with his
Insolent <hi>Paraenesis</hi> to that <hi>Republick,</hi> are clear Evidences
of his sence in this matter. What <hi>Bellarmin</hi> taught more
shortly and obscurely in his Controversies, was afterwards
made more plain both by his Writings, about the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, upon the Interdict of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
and against King <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>William Barklay:</hi> And
Cardinal <hi>Perrons</hi> Eloquent speech against the Bill put in
by the Third Estate of <hi>France,</hi> for Condemning those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
of a Deposing Power, shews us not only his own
sense, but the sense of the whole Clergy of <hi>France;</hi> in
whose name he delivered it.<note n="u" place="margin">In his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses Oevres and Recueil General des Affaires dis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Clerge de France.</note> He calls the Contrary
Opinion, <hi>a Doctrine that breeds Schisms, a Gate that leads
unto all Heresie, and so detestable, that he and his Fellow
Bishops will choose to burn at a <unclear>Stake</unclear> rather than consent
to it.</hi> He affirming That <hi>all the parts of the Catholick
Church, and of the Church of</hi> France <hi>in particular, and
all the Schools of Divinity, till the coming of</hi> Calvin, <hi>held
the affirmative,</hi> and says, <hi>That no where in</hi> France <hi>since
the Divinity Schools were set up, can they find any one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
Divine, or Lawyer, any Decree, Council, or Sentence
of Parliament, or any one Magistrate Ecclesiastick, or
Politick, who had held that in case of Heresie or Idolatry,
Subjects might not be absolved from their Oaths of Fidelity
to their Princes.</hi> It is true, at first he spake more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly,
and pretended the thing was problematical, and
so was not fit matter for an Oath: but when that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40390:15"/>
Strain (tho it tended all to depress the Regal, and
exalt the Papal Power) had so far prevailed with the
King, that he ordered the matter to be laid aside, and not
to be further insisted on. They were not satisfied with
this, but made a new Address in the Name of the Clergy;
and the Cardinal spake now in a higher tone, asserting
formally the Popes indirect Power in Temporals; and that
all who maintained the contrary were Schismaticks, and
Hereticks, even those of the Parliament it self; and did
plainly threaten the King, That if he did not raze all the
Proceedings out of the Register, the Clergy would leave
the Assembly, and Excommunicate all who denied the
Popes Power of Deposing. And if the King would not
suffer them to execute these Censures, they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon their hazard tho they were to suffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for it. For which zeal, they received a Breve from
the Pope, giving them his solemn Thanks for what they
had done; desiring them to persevere in the same mind.
So we have in this Instance, not only Cardinal <hi>Perrons</hi>
own mind, but the sense of the whole Clergy of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not think it necessary to enquire further into the
opinion of later Writers; tho it were easie to shew,
that to this day, both the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Jesuites, the Writers both of Controversies,
and Cases of Conscience, and the Expositors of Scripture,
do as oft as occasion offers, assert the power of Deposing
Kings to be still in the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And tho some few
Writers of that Religion, since <hi>Barkelay</hi> and <hi>Widdring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
time, both of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Nation, have
adventured to deny this power; they have been censured
for it, and branded with Heresy. This has been so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
in the matter of the Irish Remonstrance, that I
need say no more of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:40390:16"/>
But whether the Writers of this Age allow it or not,
they are bound according to their Doctrine about Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to acknowledg it; since two of the Characters of
Tradition are found to agree to it. For it has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in several Ages of the Church, as true Catholick
Doctrine by all the publick Doctors in these times: so
that either This is a Tradition of the Church, or That is
not a true mark of Tradition: nor is it a certain convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Truth, if we may be thus deceived in a clear Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
for four Ages successively. It does also appear,
that if the See of <hi>Rome</hi> be a faithful Depositary and
Transmitter of Church Traditions, this must be one, since
it is delivered to the world by so many Popes in the names
of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and founded on the <hi>Power of
the Keys,</hi> and <hi>of Binding and Loosing</hi> granted to St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I shall next shew how the third mark of Tradition,
the Authority of General Councils, agrees to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
When this Doctrine had been so well spread over
<hi>Europe,</hi> then the Popes found it was safe, to trust it to
the judgment of such an Assembly as they esteemed a
General Council. And they proceeded in this matter,
after the same manner that they had done in the worship
of Images: and as they did afterwards in the points of
Transubstantiation, and denying the Chalice in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
They took care first to infuse it into all the
Clergy, (which God wot's was no hard thing) and then
brought them together, and made up the Pageant of a
Council, for giving it more authority. So above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years after <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII. had first taught this
Doctrine, a thing under the name of a General Council
sate in the <hi>Lateran</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> where, upon the advantage
the Popes had against the <hi>Albigenses</hi> and others, who were
according to their Opinion most pestiferous Hereticks;
they first procured a Decree for it. It is true, many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40390:16"/>
Councils had concurred with <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII.
(one of these is called a General one, 110 Bishops being
present) and the other Popes who had formerly given
out these Thunders: But now the matter was to be
more solemnly Transacted.</p>
            <p>In this Council many Hereticks are condemned and
Excommunicated; <hi>and all that had sworn Oaths of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
or Homage to them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conc. Late. 3. Chap. 27. anno 1287. Tom 28.</note> 
               <hi>are Absolved from those Oaths:
and they are required in order to the obtaining the Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their sins, to fight against them: and those who die
doing penance in that manner, may without doubt expect
Indulgence for their sins, with eternal rewards.</hi> And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
<hi>by the authority of St.</hi> Peter <hi>and St.</hi> Paul <hi>they
Remit to all who shall rise and fight against them, two
years Penance.</hi> Here the Council does industriously
infuse this Doctrine into all people; and calls Rebellion
<hi>Penance</hi> (a very easy one to a poor or discontented
Subject) and assures them of a deliverance from Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and that they should be admitted straight to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for it. In an Age in which these things were believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
more effectual means than those could not be found
out, to engage the people in it.</p>
            <p>By this Decree, if we are guilty of the Heresies then
condemned, (as no doubt we are of most of them) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado, or any further Sentence, upon the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
us guilty of the Heresies of the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are delivered from their obligations to the King.
And when they conspire or rebel against him, they are
only doing penance for their sins; and he were hard-hearted
that would punish men only for doing of pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>About thirty years after that Council, the Pope had a
mind to regulate the former Law, That the Deposing of
Kings might be declared a part of his Prerogative; and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40390:17"/>
that thereby he might with authority Dispose of their
Kingdoms to others. For hitherto the Popes had only
pretended to the Power of Deposing, and then the States
of the Kingdom as in an Interregne, were to choose a
new Prince. But P. <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. thought it was half
work, except he could bestow, as well as take away
Crowns. His Predecessor <hi>Celestine</hi> had in a most extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
humour set the Crown on <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth his
head, with his two feet, and then kickt it off again; to
shew, according to <hi>Barronius</hi> his Comment, <hi>That it was
in his power to give, to maintain, and take away the Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very full Assembly therefore being called of about
1200 of one sort or other to the <hi>Lateran</hi> again,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conc. Later. 4. Can. 3. Tom.</hi> 28. The same Council that established Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</note> It was
first Decreed, <hi>That the aid of Secular Princes should be
required for the Extirpating of Hereticks;</hi> after that they
proceed and enact thus. <hi>When the Temporal Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or admonished by the Church, shall neglect to purge his
Territory from Heretical wickedness, let him be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
by the Metropolitan and his Suffragans. And if
he persist in neglecting to give satisfaction for the space of
a year, let him be signified to the Pope: That he from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
may pronounce his Subjects discharged from their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and expose his Territory to be seized on by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
who having exterminated the Hereticks, shall possess
it withont contradiction, and preserve it in the purity of
the Faieh; so as no injury be done to the Right of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Lord, where there is such, provided he do not any
way oppose himself: and the same Law is to take place on
them, who have no Superiour Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deposition of the Court of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> being the
thing then in their eye, made that the Decree runs chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against Feudatary Princes, yet as the last Clause takes
in Soveraign Princes, so by the Clause before, it was
provided, <hi>That if the Soveraign did any way Oppose what
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40390:17"/>
was done against his Vassal, he was to forfeit his Right.</hi> I
did in the former part of this Letter, meet with all the
Exceptions that are commonly made to this Canon. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one pretty Answer which a person of Honour makes,
is yet to be considered. He tells us, that there were so
many Soveraign Princes, or Ambassadors from them, at
this Council, that we are to look on this Decree, as a
thing to which those Princes consented. From whence
he Infers, It was rather their Act, than an Invasion of
their Rights made by that Council But be it so, he knows
they allow no Prescription against the Church. If then
those Princes consented to it, upon which the power of
Deposing had that Accession to fortifie it by, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be recalled nor prescribed against. It is true there
were many Ambassadors from Princes there: But they
were all such as either held their Dominions by the Popes
Grant, or had been either Deposed by him, or Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Depositions, or were the Children of those
whom he had Deposed. So no wonder they stood in
such fear of the Pope, that they durst not refuse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to every thing he had a mind to. For indeed this
Council did only give their <hi>Placet</hi> to a paper of Decrees
penned by the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> called the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor, Brother to <hi>Baldwin,</hi>
that had seized on <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had no other Title to
it besides the Popes Gift. <hi>Frederick</hi> the 2d. who had been
the Popes Ward, was then the Elect Emperor of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
made so at the Popes Instance, who had Deposed the
two Immediately preceding Emperours, <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Otho</hi>
the 4th. the last being at that time alive; So that he durst
not contradict the Pope, lest he should have set up <hi>Otho</hi>
against him. But no Emperor, except <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, ever
suffered more from the Popes Tyranny, than he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
One sad Instance of it was, that the Pope having
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40390:18"/>
pressed his March to the Holy-land much, did at last Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
him for his delays: upon which, he to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
further censures, carried an Army thither: which
was so succesful, that the Pope who hoped he should
have been destroyed in the Expedition, (as the first Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of that name was) now being vexed at his Success,
complained that he should have presumed to go thither,
while he lay under Excommunication, and was in Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against him; and went about not only to Dethrone
him, but to get him to be betrayed by the Knights Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitallers,
and Templers, into the Sultans hands, who
abominating that Treachery, revealed it to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Brenne</hi> had the Kingdom of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by that
same Popes Gift, who took it from <hi>Almeric</hi> King of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi>
and gave it him; But <hi>Almeric</hi> had no cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
since he held <hi>Cyprus</hi> only by the same Copy of the
Popes Gift: So they both were at the Popes Mercy Our
<hi>John</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was his Vassal, as he usually called him;
But his Successour went higher, calling the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
not only his Vassal, but <hi>his Slave;</hi> and Declared
<hi>That at his beck he could procure him to be Imprisoned, and
Disgraced.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. Paris. ad An. 1253.</note> 
               <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who was also the
Popes Ward, had no less reason to be afraid of the Pope,
who had Deposed his Father for Assisting the Count of
<hi>Tholouse. Philip Augustus</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> had his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
twice put under an Interdict, worse things being
also threatned. The like Threatnings had been made to
<hi>Andrew</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> but upon his Submission he
was received into favour.</p>
            <p>And now is it any wonder, that those Princes gave
way to such a Decree, when they knew not how to help
themselves by Opposing it, which would have raised a
Storm, that they could not hope to weather?</p>
            <p>Anothet thing is remarkable concerning this time, by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40390:18"/>
which the Belief of the Deposing Doctrine in that Age
will better appear. Other Princes whom Popes had De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
procured some Civilians to write for them; and
got Synods of Bishops sometimes on their side against the
Pope. Because it was evident the Pope proceeded not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Account of Heresie, but of private spite and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.
But in the case of the Count of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> who was
a manifest Favourer of that, which was esteemed Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
(the Opinions of the <hi>Albigenses</hi> that were his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects)
not a Writer in all that Age durst undertake to
defend his cause, nor could he procure one Bishop to be
of his side. So universally was it received, that in the case
of Heresie, a Prince might be Deposed by the Pope.</p>
            <p>The 3d General Council that Confirmed this Power,<note place="margin">Conc. Lugd. Tom. 28.</note>
was the Council of <hi>Lions,</hi> held by <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4th a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the forementioned <hi>Frederick</hi> the 2d, where (as the
Sentence bears) <hi>The Pope having Consulted with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and the Holy Council, being Christs Vicar on Earth,
to whom it was said in the person of St.</hi> Peter, <hi>whatsoever
ye bind on Earth, &amp;c. Declares the Emperor bound in his
sins, and thereup<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n Deprived by God of his Dominions.
Whereupon he by his Sentence does Depose him, and absolves
all from their Oaths of Fidellty to him. Straitly charging
all persons, to acknowledge him no more either Emperor or
King. Declaring all that did otherwise, Excommunicated</hi>
ipso facto. There are in this Process several things ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
remarkable. It is grounded on a pretence to a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Tradition; So here the whole Council concur with
the Pope, in asserting this power to flow from that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.
And thus either that Tradition is true, or the
Councils are not to be believed when they Declare a
Tradition 2ly. Tho this is but a Decree in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Instance, yet it is founded on the General Rule; And
so is a Confirmation of it, by which it is put out of doubt
that the 4th Council of <hi>Later an</hi> included Soveraign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40390:19"/>
within their Decree. 3ly, When the Emperors Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
appeared to plead for him; He did not at all except
to their Jurisdiction over him, or Power of Deposing in
the case of Heresie, but denyed that the Emperor was
guilty of the crimes Objected, namely Heresie, whereby
he, at least, waved the denial of their Power in that
case. He also desired some time might be granted for
the Emperor to appear and plead for himself in person.
Whereby he plainly acknowledged their Jurisdiction. 4ly
When the Ambassadors of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
that the Emperors desire might be granted; the
Council gave him near two weeks time to appear in:
which was so incompetent a time, and all had declared
themselves so prepossest, or rather so overawed by the
Pope that hated him Mortally; That the Emperor
would not appear because they were his professed Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.
And upon that, and other grounds (none of them
touching on the power of Deposing in cases of Heresie)
He appealed from them, to the next General Council;
Upon which the Pope and Prelates sitting in Council,
with Candles burning in their hands, thundred out the
Sentence against him.</p>
            <p>Here were three very publick Judgments, of three Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils on this Head, within the compass of sixty
years. But it may be imagined, these were Councils that
wholly depended on the Pope; and so their Decrees are
to be looked on, only as a Ceremony used by the Pope
to make his own Sentence look more solemn. But when
upon the long Schism in the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> the power of
that See was much shaken, and a Council met at <hi>Constance</hi>
to heal that Breach; in which the Bishops taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
from that Conjuncture, to recover their former Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
began to Regulate many matters. It may be, upon
such an occasion, expected, that if any Party in the
Church had disliked these practices, they should have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40390:19"/>
been now condemned; and that the rather, since by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Bishops might have hoped to get the Princes to
be of their side, in their Contests with the Pope. But it
fell out quite otherwise. For as the Murtherers of his late
Sacred Majesty pretended, when the King was killed,
that all his power was devolved on them, and would
have even the same precedence allowed their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
in forreign parts, that his had: So the Council of
<hi>Constance</hi> reckoned, that whatever Rights the Popes had
assumed, did now rest with them, as the Supreme Power
of the Church. For in one of their Sessions, a Decree
was framed, made up of all the severe Decrees that had
ever been made against those who violated the Rights of
the Church: And this Clause often returns, <hi>That all the
Breakers of these Priviledges, whether they were Emperors,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Conc. Const. Tom. 29. Sess. 19.</note>
               <hi>Kings, or whatsoever other Degree, were thereby,</hi> ipso facto,
<hi>subjected to the Banns, Punishments, and Censures set down
in the Council of</hi> Lateran. And tho they do not call it
the Fourth Council, yet we are sure it could be no other;
for they relate to that in which <hi>Frederick</hi> the 2d. was
consenting to, which was the fourth in the <hi>Lateran</hi> And
in another Decree, by which they hoped to have set up
a Succession of General Councils, at every ten years end;
this Clause is added, <hi>That if any person, whether of the
Papal</hi> (for they had subjected the Pope to the Council,<note place="margin">Sess. 15.</note>
and had more reason to fear his opposing this Decree, than
any Bodies else) <hi>Imperial or Regal Dignity, &amp;c. should
presume to hinder any to come to the next General Council,
he is declared to be first Excommunicated, then under an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict,
and then to be subject to further punishment both Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
and Spiritual.</hi> And in the Pass they gave the King
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to go to the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> they add
this Sanction, <hi>That whatever person, whether King, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
&amp;c. do hinder him in his Journey, he is</hi> ipso facto,<note place="margin">Sess. 17.</note>
               <hi>deprived of all Honour, Dignity, Office, or Benefice, whether
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40390:20"/>
Ecclesiastical or Secular.</hi> So here the indirect power over
Princes, by which they may be both deposed and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is plainly assumed. It is true that same Council did
indeed Decree,<note place="margin">Sess. 15.</note> That no Subject should murther his King
or Prince; upon which some of our <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who condemn these practices, think they have great
advantages. That D<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cree was procured by <hi>Gersons</hi> means,
who observing that by the many Rebellions that had been
generally set on by Popes, the Persons of Princes were
brought under such contempt, that private Assassinations
came to be practised: and in particular that of the Duke
of <hi>Orleance</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Burgundy:</hi> Therefore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the fatal consequences which were like to follow on
that, and to hinder such practices for the future, he with
great earnestness followed that matter: And tho it had
almost cost him his life (it is like from some of the Duke
of <hi>Orleance</hi> his Faction, who were resolved on a Revenge)
yet at last he procured it: But this was only a Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of private Cut-throats. And the Article condemned
had a pretty Reservation in it, for it strikes only against
Subjects killing their Prince, <hi>without waiting for the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of any Judg whatsoever.</hi> So if a Sentence be past by
the Spiritual Judg, then this Condemnation notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
a Prince may be Murthered. And the other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of that Council passed in the same Session, shew they
had no mind to part with the Deposing Power. Besides
the Answer to this Decree is clear. It is acknowledged:
by the Defenders of the contrary opinion, That it is not
lawful in any case to kill a King; but when one that was
a King is no more such, but becomes a Rebel and an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper,
then it is lawful to kill him.</p>
            <p>Pursuant, to the Decree made at <hi>Constance,</hi> a Council
met at <hi>Siena</hi> ten years after,<note place="margin">Con, Sien. Tom. 29.</note> in which all the former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
made against Hereticks are confirmed, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
or <hi>Fautors</hi> of Heresie are delared liable to all the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40390:20"/>
pains and censures of Hereticks, and by consequence to
the chief of them all, <hi>Deposition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After that came the Council of <hi>Basil,</hi> which ratified the<note place="margin">Con. Basil. Tom. 29.</note>
forementioned Decree made at <hi>Constance</hi> about General
Councils. By which Popes, Emperors, Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
presumed to hinder any from coming to the Council, are
subjected to Excommunication, Interdicts and <hi>other Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
Spiritual and Temporal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Last of all came the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and tho mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters
were at that pass,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conc. Trid. Sess. 25 c.</hi> 19.</note> that the Council durst not tread on
Princes, as others had formerly done, lest they should
have been thereby provoked to join with the Protestants;
yet they would not quite lay aside the pretence of a Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
power, but resolved to couch it so into some Decree,
that it might continue their claim to a Right, which they
would not part with, tho they knew not at that time
what to make of it. So in the Decree against Duels, they
declare, <hi>That if any Emperors, Kings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did assign a field
for a Combat, that they did thereby lose their Right to that
place, and the City, Castle, or other places about it.</hi> Now
it is certain, if by their Decrees a Prince may forfeit any
part of his Dominion, he may be also dispossessed of all
the rest; since his Title to his whole Territory being
one individual thing, what shakes it in any part, subjects
it entirely to him who has such authority over it.</p>
            <p>Here we have found 7 General Councils, as they are
esteemed by that Church, all either expresly asserting the
Deposing Power, or ratifying former Decrees that had
asserted it. And from such a succession of Councils, it is
reasonable to conclude, That this Third Character of a
Tradition of the Church agrees to it; and if General
Councils are fit Conveyors of Traditions, we have as
full Evidence as can be desired, for proving this to be
a Church-Tradition.</p>
            <p>This last Character of a Tradition is what the whole
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40390:21"/>
Body of the Church has held in any one Age. Upon which,
they say, we may calculate that such opinions must have
come down from the Apostles, since it seems neither cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
nor possible, that the Belief of the Church could
be changed. With this <hi>Arnold</hi> has of late made great
noise. And as the new Fashions that come from <hi>France</hi> do
please our young Gallants best, so some of the Writers
of Controversies among us have taken up the same plea
here. That the whole Church received the Deposing
Doctrine in cases of Heresy, may be inferred from what
had been said. The Church is made up of Popes, Bishops, &amp;
Priests: Of Soveraign Princes, and Subjects of all ranks.
That the Popes believed it, none can doubt. So many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
of Councils, shews us as plainly what the Bishops
and other Prelates believed: the Writing of the School-men
and Canonists shew, what the rest of the Clergy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
Those Princes who suffered under the Sentences,
give at least a tacit consent to it, since they never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
it, but study only to clear themselves of the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Heresie. The other Princes who made use of the
Donations of the Popes, shew as plainly that they believ'd
it. The great Armies that were brought about their Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards,
must have also believed it: and the people who
generally deserted the Deposed Prince, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great vertues of some of them, and the love that
Subjects naturally carry to their Princes, shew that they
believed it. So that if St. <hi>James</hi> his Question, <hi>Shew me
thy Faith by thy Works,</hi> be applied to this particular, the
Answer will be easie. What shall I mention the frequent
depositions of <hi>Charles</hi> the 1st, of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, of his Son
<hi>Henry</hi> the 5th, of <hi>Frederick</hi> the 1st, <hi>Philip, Otho</hi> the 4th,
<hi>Frederick</hi> the 2d, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the 4th in the Empire. The
frequent Depositions in <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples;</hi> the many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
upon <hi>France;</hi> that terrible Bull in particular of
<hi>Julius</hi> the 2d, against that good King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40390:21"/>
By which, besides the Sentence against the King, it appears
he designed the total destruction of the Nation, promising
the Pardon of Sin to every one that killed one <hi>French</hi>
Man; the frequent Attempts upon <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bud. de Asse lib. 5.</note> both in <hi>Hen.</hi>
the 2d, and K. <hi>John</hi>'s time; not to mention their later
Bulls of Deposition against K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, and Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth;</hi>
the many Attempts in <hi>Spain;</hi> particularly; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> by P. <hi>Julius;</hi> and the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
against <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, then King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and
the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> All these, and a great many more,
with the strange Effects that followed upon them, are
so clear Proofs of the Worlds believing this Doctrine, for
many Ages together, that if Men had any Remainders
of shame left with them, they could not deny it. And
to this day all their Writers maintain it, tho perhaps now
the greatest part of the Laity know little of it; but
whenever the Tradition of the Church is laid before
them, they are obliged to submit, or they fall from the
Catholick Faith, the chief Branch of which is, To believe
all the Traditions of the Church. And since the Church
is the same in all Ages, according to their Doctrine, the
Traditions of any one Age must be as good as the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of any other can be, all being grounded on the
same Authority.</p>
            <p>And now let all the Reasons that <hi>Arnold</hi> brings to prove,
from the Churches believing Transubstantiation in any
Age, that she must have always believed it, be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and applied with a small variation of the Terms to
this Purpose; and we shall see if they conclude not as
strongly in favour of this Doctrine, as for that which he
has pursued so much. <hi>How can it be imagined,</hi> says he,
<hi>that a Doctrine so contrary to common Sence and Reason,
could have been so universally received, if every Man
had not been taught it by those who instructed him in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40390:22"/>
Faith? Will Men easily change their Faith? Or, tho
particular Persons would prevaricate, would the whole
Clergy conspire to do it? Or would the People take it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
off their hands.</hi> These and many more Topicks
of that sort may be so mustered up, and set off by a Man
of Wit and Eloquence, that an ordinary Person would
stare, and not know what to say. The Premises will
shew, that there is need but of very little Art to change
the same Plea, and fit it to this purpose, with two great
advantages beyond what can be fanci'd to be in the other.
The one is, that the generality of Mankind is naturally
more concerned in the preservation of Temporal things,
than about nice points of Speculation; the one they see
and handle every day, and are much concerned about;
the other they hear little of, and are not much touched
with them. So that it is less probable there could be a
change made in opinions, on which the Titles of Princes,
and the Peace of Kingdoms depended, than about subtil
Discourses concerning Mysteries. So that the Plea is
stronger for the Tradition of deposing Kings, than for
Transubstantiation. A second Difference is, That there
was a continual Opposition made to the belief of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation
in all Ages, which they themselves do not
deny, only they shift it off the best they can, by calling
the Opposers Hereticks; but for the deposing Doctrine,
there was not one Person in the whole World, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
to bring it in question, from the first time it was
pretended to, till those whom they call Hereticks dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against it; and tho some few others, who hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them, have ventured on a canvasing of that
Doctrine, it is well enough known what thanks they
got from <hi>Rome;</hi> nor can they shew any one Book, licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
according to the Rules of their Church, that denies
it. And thus the Plea for this Doctrine has a double Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40390:22"/>
beyond that for Transubstantiation.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter then, if Tradition be a sure
Conveyance, and if we may pronounce what is truly a
Tradition, either from the Opinions of Doctors, the
Constitutions of Popes, the Decrees of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and the universal Consent of the whole Church for
some Ages; then the Doctrine of deposing Kings, to
which all these agree, must be reckoned among Church-Traditions.
There is but one other Mark that can be
devised of a Tradition, which is, What the Church has
taught and believed in all Ages; but for a certain Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which they know very well, they will not stand to
that. They know we do not refuse such Traditions, and
if only such may be received, then the Worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
the Prayers to Saints, the Worship in an unknown
Tongue, the Belief of Transubstantiation, the Sacrifice
of the Mass, the denying the Chalice to the Laity, the
redeeming Souls out of Purgatory, with many other
things of the like nature, will be soon taken off of the
File. And indeed in this sence, the deposing Doctrine is
so far from being a Tradition, that we have as undeniable
Evidences, that the Church for the first six Ages knew
nothing of it, but on the contrary abhorred the thoughts
of it, as we have, that their Church these last six Ages has
set it up: From which, among many other Reasons, we
conclude, that these latter Ages have not been acted
with the same Spirit, nor followed the same Doctrine,
that was the Rule of the former Ages.</p>
            <p>There is more than enough said to shew, that these
Doctrines are a part of their Faith; from which they can
never extricate themselves, but by confessing, either that
their Church has erred, or that Tradition is no true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance;
when they do either of these, they turn their
Backs of <hi>Rome,</hi> and are in a fair away to come over to our
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40390:23"/>
Church, with which purpose I pray God inspire them.</p>
            <p>The mean while, it is no wonder, if those of that
Communion, have been guilty of such horrid Plots and
Rebellions every where, especially in <hi>England,</hi> since
<hi>Henry</hi> the 8th's time. There was in his Reign, First a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> another greater one in the North,
and some lesser ones after that. In <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th's time,
there were Risings, both in the North, and in the West.
But these succeeded so ill, and turned only to the ruine of
their own Party, that they resolved to try secreter ways
in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time; in whose long and blessed
Reign, there scarce passed one year in which there was
not some Plot against her Life. There was not Matter
enough to work upon, for raising any considerable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
in <hi>England:</hi> But in <hi>Ireland,</hi> there were more
frequent attempts that way. It is true, the Care and
Providence of God was too hard for all their Plots, how
closely soever laid; and they were turned back on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
not so much to the ruine of the chief Plotters
(who were wise enough to conveigh themselves out of
the way) as of many Noble Families, that were poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
with their ill Principles. All the Blood which the
State was forced to shed, lies at their door, who were
continually giving fresh Provocations. And for King
<hi>James</hi> (not to mention the Conspiracies against him in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> nor that Plot of <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Watson,</hi> upon his
first coming to this Crown) the Gun-powder Treason
was a thing that went beyond all the wicked Designs
that had been ever in any Age contrived. And when
his late Majesty was Embroiled in his Affairs in this
Island, how did they take advantage from that Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
to break out into a most horrid Rebellion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
joyned with a Massacre of Persons of whatsoever
Age, or Sex, or Condition? Which was so far set on by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40390:23"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> that a Nuncio came publickly to direct their
Councils. I will not dwell on Particulars that are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
known, but only name these things, to shew,
That no Reign of any of our Princes, since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
has been free from the dismal effects of these
Doctrines. And for his Sacred Majesty who now Reigns,
(whom God long preserve from their Malice) they have
felt such signal marks of his Royal Clemency, that they
can have no colour to complain, except it be, because
they cannot bear any Office in the Nation. For what
Noise soever they make, of the severe Laws yet in force,
both against the Clergy and Laity of their Religion,
they cannot pretend that since his Majesties happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration,
any Priest has died, or any Family has been
ruined for their Religion. But I confess, it is enough,
according to the Doctrine of their Church, to discharge
them of their Allegiance, That the King is a favourer of
Heresy; and if upon this Reason they will still Plot
and Conspire against his Person and Government, we
have no reason to wonder at it, for they act according
to their Principles.</p>
            <p>Nor have these Islands been the only Scenes, in which
those Principles have produced such dismal Effects. If
we look abroad and reflect on what was done in <hi>France,</hi>
we shall find, they have had the same Operation there. I
need not mention that perfidious and cruel Massacre,
that as <hi>Thuanus</hi> tells us was so much extolled in <hi>Rome</hi>
and <hi>Spain:</hi> and of which the Pope has a Memorial kept
in the Hangings, at the entrance of his Chappel, to this
day. The Barricadoes of <hi>Paris,</hi> the design of Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<hi>Henry</hi> the 3d, only because he had made Peace with
the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> the
whole progress of the holy League; their taking Arms
against that King, when the Duke and Cardinal of <hi>Guise</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:40390:24"/>
were killed by his Orders, and at last his being stabbed
by <hi>Clement,</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> Friar, are Instances beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
The prosecution of the Rebellion against <hi>Henry</hi>
the 4th, the attempt made upon his Person by <hi>John
Chastel,</hi> which was more successful in <hi>Ravilliack</hi>'s hands,
shew sufficiently, That a Princes turning from that, which
they call Heresie, over to their Church, does not secure
him, unless he will extirpate Hereticks. For tho <hi>Henry</hi>
the 4th changed his Religion, yet the favour he shewed
the Protestants, in the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> was a thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be forgiven. These things were set on and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and pleaded for by their Writers.
That the holy League was authorized from <hi>Rome,</hi> that
<hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5th, by his Bulls, declared the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var</hi>
incapable of the Succession, that he intended to have
Deposed <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d, and that he rejoyced at his death,
and magnified the Fact; preferring it to <hi>Eleazar</hi>'s killing
the Elephant, and <hi>Judeth</hi>'s killing <hi>Hollofernes,</hi> and ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
it to a singular Providence and Disposition of the
Almighty; called it a great Miracle, and appeared vain
that a Friar had done it, having been one himself, (tho
no doubt he had liked it better, if <hi>Clement</hi> had been of
his own sute) and would have had himself thought a
Prophet for foretelling it, (and so he might well do
perhaps): and in the end concluded, That unfortunate
Kings favouring Hereticks, to be the unpardonable Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Holy Ghost: These were all so publickly done,
that it were a needless labour, to go about the proving
them. <hi>Franois Veronne</hi> wrote a Book, to justify both the
Facts of <hi>Clement</hi> the Dominican, and <hi>Chastel,</hi> (as well he
might from the Principles of their Church). After all
these dismal Facts, was it not time for the States of
<hi>France,</hi> to think of some effectual Remedy, to prevent
the like for the future? And they judged aright, that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40390:24"/>
without Condemning the Deposing Power, it could not
be done: To which, as was already hinted, the Clergy
made such vigorous Opposition,<note place="margin">Diseuss. Decree. Con. Lateran. <hi>p.</hi> 46.</note> that it came to nothing.</p>
            <p>If these things had flowed only from the heat of some
violent Spirits, the danger were not so great; but it is
the Doctrine of their Church, so <hi>Lessius</hi> (under the
name of <hi>Singletonus)</hi> says, <hi>That if the power of Deposing
lies not in the Pope, the Church must of necessity Err, which
has taught it;</hi> and to assert that, <hi>is Heretical, and a more
intollerable Error, than any about the Sacrament can be.</hi>
And <hi>Becanus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bec.</hi> Controv. Angl. p. 115.</note> Confessor to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the 2d, says, <hi>No
Man doubts, but if Princes are Contumacious, the Pope
may order their Lives to be taken away.</hi> What security then
can there be found out from Persons, who give up their
Consciences to the conduct of Men of such Principles;
and profess an Implicite Obedience and belief of all that
their Church teaches and commands, which possesses all its
Votaries with such cursed rage against Hereticks, that
not content to adjudg them to eternal Flames in another
Life, they must needs Persecute and Burn without Mercy
where they have the Power in their Hands; and Plot
and Conspire, Kill and Massacre without relenting,
where they have not Power to do it with any colour of
Law?</p>
            <p>Men of Honour will not be easily drawn in to such
Practices. But in Conclusion, when a fit Opportunity
appears, they must either forsake their Church, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
in the most mischievous Designs, that the Masters of
their Consciences will draw them into; which I pray
God make them see in good time, before they are Invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in such Snares, that Repentance will come too late
to do them good, or to preserve the Nation from those
Miseries that they will bring upon it.</p>
