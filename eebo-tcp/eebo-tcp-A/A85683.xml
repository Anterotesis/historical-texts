            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To fall foule upon the degenerous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable nature of this people cannot anſwer you, for it doth not me.</p>

There was never more provocations for all men to ſpeake then now, when all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife that other ages did but <hi>imagine</hi> are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed by a Law, and in the meane time the <hi>dumbe Aſses are taught to forbid the madneſse of the Prophets.</hi>

            <p>The courſe <hi>I</hi> have runne here is <hi>Labour</hi> too, and in the ſame <hi>Vineyard.</hi> And <hi>I</hi> truſt my ſelfe for this, that my accounts will be as well paſs't <hi>above,</hi> if <hi>I</hi> reckon upon theſe paines, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whereof though not ſo popular, yet is as ſubſtantially proficient towards the maine Aedification.</p>

of Iudah were mighty men, and fit to draw the Bow by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Iacob, Gen.</hi> 49. 8. Where it is prophecied that the hand of <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhall be in the necke of his Enemies, that is, (ſaith <hi>Chimhi</hi> as ſome of our <hi>wiſemen</hi> expound) <hi>the Bow.</hi> Therefore they take the <hi>Booke of Iaſher</hi> to be the firſt of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> called <hi>Geneſis,</hi> in which the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> the <hi>Ieſhirim,</hi> or upright men are recorded; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they take the booke to be <hi>Beracoth Iacob,</hi> or the <hi>Bleſſings of Iacob.</hi> Thus the Jewes.</p>
               <p>Though we have <hi>wiſemen</hi> of our owne to follow them in the Interpretation of the <hi>Bow.</hi> Yet they will appeare to be as idle in <hi>this.</hi> as in their conceipt of the <hi>booke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it a thing to be thought that the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> were now to learne the uſe of the Bow? 'Twas the common Tacticke practice.</p>
               <p>The Hebraiſme of Bow is like that of bread: It nameth for all other kinde of Ammunition. And where's the conſequence here that becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> (excellent Archers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the Bow of <hi>Ionathan</hi> turned not backe) fell downe before the Arrowes of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> that therefore the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhould be taught the uſe of the Bow? But the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence is worſe. And <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Booke bringeth <hi>David</hi> in beginning an <hi>epicedium</hi> upon the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately breaketh him off with an impertinent command to the ſonnes of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that they ſhould learne to handle the bow. And where is it, or why is it that this <hi>ſhould be written in the Booke of Iaſher?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Mariana</hi> very underſtandingly ſtept aſide out of the common Road of Interpretation, and conſidered with himſelfe that the Bow here might be taken for the Title of the Song, which cannot be ſtrange to them that will compare this with the granted ſuperſcriptions upon <hi>David's</hi> Pſalmes, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. To the cheife Muſitian upon <hi>Shaſhannim. Pſal.</hi> 67. Upon <hi>Neginoth. Pſal.</hi> 59. To the cheife Muſitian <hi>Altaſhith,</hi> &amp;c. So here to the cheife Muſitian <hi>Keſheth,</hi> or the Bow. For ſo the Text is to be read. And he bade them, that is, the

cheife Muſitians <hi>Heman, Ethan, &amp; Ieduthun</hi> to teach the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people how to ſing this Lamentation of <hi>David</hi> upon the death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan.</hi> It was entitled <hi>Keſheth,</hi> or the Bow, becauſe it was occaſioned by the <hi>Philiſtin</hi> Archers, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 31. 3. But eſpecially reſpecting to the Bow of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> which returned not backe from the bloud of the ſlaine, as the Song it ſelfe expreſſeth. And <hi>David</hi> could not but remember the Bow of <hi>Ionathan</hi> out of which <hi>that Arrow was ſhot beyond the Lad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 36. It was the time when that Covenant was made, and that affection expreſſed betwixt them which was greater then the love of women.</p>
               <p>And 'tis ſaid there too that <hi>David</hi> exceeded, <hi>v.</hi> 41. And there alſo <hi>Ionathan</hi> required that this kindneſſe of the Lord ſhould be ſhewed unto him longer then he lived. <hi>And thou ſhalt not onely whilſt yet I live, &amp;c. v,</hi> 14, 15.</p>
               <p>The Lxx will beare out this Interpretation. The verſion there is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. [that is] And <hi>David</hi> lamented this Lamentation upon <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> his Sonne, and cauſed it to be taught to the Sonnes of <hi>Iudah.</hi> Behold it is written in the Booke of the Juſt man:] So the vulgar. <hi>Planxit autem David Planctum hujuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiſuper Saul &amp; ſuper Ionathan filium ejus, &amp; pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true the late Editions of this Tranſlation have ſhifted in the word <hi>Arcum</hi> inſtead of <hi>Planctum.</hi> But in the ancient Manuſcripts it is ſo as I have quoted it. And in the Elder printed copies 'tis <hi>Arcum,</hi> but in the Margin onely which afterwards crept into the Text, if I may call the Tranſlation ſo.</p>
               <p>Therefore alſo by theſe two great Authorities that which the Sonnes of <hi>Iudah</hi> were commanded to learne was not the uſe of the Bow. But the Bow, as 'tis originally ſet downe, that is, a Song of <hi>David</hi> ſo called, or this Song of Lamentation o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan.</hi> And this is that which was written in the Booke of <hi>Iaſher.</hi> Why this Booke was ſo called, or who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113683:15"/>
was the Author of it, I cannot tell you. That it was not the firſt of <hi>Moſes</hi> (as the Rabbines would have it) is ridiculouſly plaine. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> hath let us know thus much that it was a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Temple,</hi> and you muſt not thinke it hard if it be loſt to us as yet, you ſhall heare more of this hereafter. It is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twice in Scripture, here and <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10. And if both places be conſidered, 'tis to be judg'd that nothing was recorded in this Booke but Memorialls of this kinde, and which is more to be noted, they were metricall too. The place in <hi>Ioſhua</hi> put to this here maketh it cleare. There it is quoted out of the Booke of <hi>Iaſher,</hi> that the Sun ſtood ſtill in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> and the Moone in the valley of <hi>Ajalon.</hi> This Quotation is a plaine Canticle. <hi>Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi</hi> commeth ſo neare to the matter as onely to make a doubt of it. But the thing is certaine, It is reckoned among the 10 Songs by the Mechilta an old Commentarie upon <hi>Exodus</hi> to the 15 Chapter. The 4 is that of <hi>Moſes</hi> before his deceaſe: and the 6 is that of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> and this of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> is the fifth. I would ſay more of this, had not the learned <hi>Maſius</hi> prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me upon the place, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 10. 12. This is enough to ſhew that the Song of the Bow might, but the uſe of it could not be ſet downe in the Booke of <hi>Iaſher.</hi> It is certaine that this command of <hi>David</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iudah,</hi> is not delivered in Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Indeed matter of that kinde was no fit ſubject for a Song. And now 'tis come to <hi>Tyndalls</hi> turne againe, for the <hi>New</hi> muſt be corrected by his <hi>Old Tranſlation.</hi> He rendred thus, <hi>And</hi> David <hi>ſang this Song of Mourning over</hi> Saul <hi>and over</hi> Jonathas <hi>his Sonne, and bade to teach the Children of Iſrael the Staves thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I may note one thing more and I mervaile at it too, that the vulgar Edition hath one verſe over and above in the Canticle of the Bow. <hi>Conſidera Iſrael pro his qui mortui ſunt, ſuper excelſa tua vulnerati.</hi> It ſeemeth to pretend as if it would tranſlate the firſt verſe of the Song; but that's done and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too imemdiately in the next, <hi>Inclyti Iſrael ſuper Montes tuos interfecti ſunt. Quomodo ceciderunt fortes?</hi> I found it ſo in ſome of the written as well as the printed Copies. And yet I thinke <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> did better to leave it out, then ſome others

ſince to keepe it in. It is plainely void and ſupernumerary, and an eſcape not fit to be accounted upon the Sageneſſe of that tranſlation.</p>

                  <hi>Jehovah</hi> is his proper name of his owne Impoſition and incommunicable to any Creature, of what Rank or Quality ſoever, a Name of ſuch Immoderate Reverence amongſt the oldeſt Jewes, that it was forbidden to be written right or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced at all in this world, but by the High Preiſt, and but in

one place the <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum,</hi> and but at one time of the yeare, in the day of expiation.</p>
               <p>And (which is more to the purpoſe) onely in one caſe, which was that of Benediction, when the Bleſſing and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God by the holy intervention of the Preiſt was to be derived downe upon the People.</p>
               <p>At any other time or in what place ſoever for any man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to preſume to utter this Name was more then death by the Law, as by a Report of theirs in the Talmud in the caſe of <hi>Teradion's</hi> ſonne.</p>
               <p>And as it would ſeeme to be by the Jewes, our Saviour might not himſelfe make uſe of this Name in kinde; for after their malicious rate of Tradition, they hold that he did all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles by the <hi>Paraphraſticall Tetragrammaton,</hi> or <hi>Shem-ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoraſh</hi> (as they call this Name at length and in other words) and this way of Enunciation they ſay was cut into his feet, and produced as occaſion ſerved, as to caſt out Devills (by a knowne Receſſe of the blacke Art) through <hi>him that is the Prince.</hi> And to exalt and make up the Legend they can afford his mother (the bleſſed Virgin to us and very well ſpoken of in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> it ſelfe) no better Language then that ſhe was a cunning woman, and brought this kinde of Legerdemaine out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

               <p>Seeing therefore that the Iewes and they had once the very ſame <hi>Kibla,</hi> and now have the ſame by imitation, that which is pretended to, is of eaſie conſequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>I inferre upon this, that it was an old Iewiſh funerall rite to carry up their dead bodies (after they were waſhed) into ſuch a place where they might beſt compoſe them in the religious poſture, with their Face and Feete toward <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap> of the Houſe. It is not to be miſtaken as if ſhe had beene carried up thither to this end that ſhe might be placed toward <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Rites of her Funerall were now to be Chriſtian. It was to lay her out ſo that her Face and Feete might be turned towards the Eaſt, which might be in that upper Roome, for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was Eaſt from <hi>Joppa.</hi>

the Iewiſh Rite in the poſition of their dead. <hi>Schickard</hi> confeſſeth he knew not ſo much though he liv'd amongſt them. And their owne <hi>Rabbin</hi> ſaith no more then that they lay out <note place="margin">Les mod de gli Rit. Heb. Part. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi>

               <p>DEſolation in Scripture is otherwiſe expreſſed by Silence &amp; ſitting upon the ground; By the firſt becauſe Great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is ſo. And the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> hath Nature enough in it beſides a deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation downe from the manner of the Hebrew Mourning.

               <p>But as the things themſelves, <hi>Sitting,</hi> and <hi>Silence,</hi> fall not out ſingle, ſo they are moſt commonly put downe in company. So <hi>Job</hi> 2. 13. <hi>His three freinds came to him, and ſate downe with him upon the ground ſeven dayes, and ſeven nights, and none

               <p>This is to tell the reaſon why the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Women which <hi>ſtood</hi> afarre off, (as the other Goſpells) or neare, (that is, as neare as they could for the Souldiers) were not to make any ſolemne, uſuall ſhew of Lamentation. The Mother of Jeſus muſt needs be reduced to the Extreameſt ſtate of ſadneſſe and contriſtation.

becauſe the viſion was before the Captivitie. The forme of the Character was this N. Th. or as the manuſcripts thus, Z.</p>
               <p>'Twas a marke of repented Murther, it pointed out the Juſtice of God enough, but his mercy more. The vengeance ſeemeth to have meant his Death by the ſame violence, but by a long expected and accidentall hand. The myſterie of the marke was of eaſie tradition from one to another, for the world was not ſo preſently numerous. The ſentence of it ſelfe went forth ſevere enough, but was not given to ſtand all. He was promiſed to be a Vagabond and a Runnagate, but you finde him in the next verſe getting of Children, and building of Cities. And by the greateſt Man in the Eaſt of his Time. It is to be thought that it was a cuſtome of thoſe parts for the Head of the Family to offer up ſet and ſolemne extraordinary <note place="margin">Job. 1. 5.</note>Sacrifices for the Children; for <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>It may be that my Sonnes have ſinned and curſed God in their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore I thinke it not unlikely that <hi>Adam</hi> the High Preiſt of the World then, ſhould doe his uttermoſt to make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this Bloud. <hi>Joſephus</hi> himſelfe ſaith, that he was quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Murther by Sacrifice, but he ſaith too, what no man yet hath beleived, that it was by his owne.</p>
               <p>I know not how to account his long life a downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>right puniſhment, but indulged by the mercy of God, and neceſſary to the multiplication of mankinde. As the Greater before, ſo the Leſſer Worlds now were but in their Chaos, till the Soule of Society was infuſed, and then they became a politicke <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thing.</hi> 'Twas <hi>Cain</hi> that firſt built a City, and called it after the name of his ſonne <hi>Henoch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot impute his Invention of Arts to the Curſe. Though ſimplicity of Living might become a new made world, and the beginings of things; yet the growth towards a Common-wealth and ſtature of People, required an exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt homelineſſe by a device of crafts and myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>I conceive no great matter in this, that <hi>Cain</hi> went out from the preſence of the Lord. So did <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> too. But <hi>Cain</hi> went and dwelt in the <hi>Land of Nod.</hi> And <hi>Abarbinel</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:113683:48"/>
ſaith, that he findeth in our Latine Bookes that <hi>Cain</hi> dwelt in <hi>Hodu</hi> (ſo the Eaſterne Geographers call <hi>India)</hi> and that 'tis poſſible that place may be call'd ſo from <hi>Nod,</hi> in the ſence of wandring, &amp;c.

               <p>The greateſt part of <hi>Cain</hi>'s curſe lay in this, that there was a ſeperation betwixt him and the Faithfull Church of that time, concluded up in the family of <hi>Seth. Said Aben Batric</hi> ſaith (Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> alſo and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> as they are quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Catena Arabica)</hi> that our Father <hi>Adam</hi> after the Fall retired himſelfe into a Mountaine of <hi>India</hi> called the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mountaine, prophecying that from this Mountaine one ſhould aſcend, and another goe downe; He meant <hi>Henoch</hi> by the firſt. The other was <hi>Cain,</hi> who ſaid to his Brother (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Samaritan, &amp;c.) <hi>Deſcendamus in Campum,</hi> &amp;c. And in theſe Plaines the Murther was committed. After which the Family of <hi>Seth</hi> kept themſelves to the Hill, inſtituting a Holy Life, and were therefore called <hi>The Sonnes of God;</hi> But the <hi>Cainites</hi> continued ſtill, as they increaſed, to inhabite and take up the valley, leading a Life there ſo wretched and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne, that as <hi>James</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Sarug</hi> in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>That the <hi>speciall Preſence</hi> of God ever was and is in that part of the Heaven of Heavens which anſwereth to the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall Eaſt</hi> of the Holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>land.</p>

               </p>

               <p>But of this I make no great matter. That in the Revelation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 2. if it looke not this way, I know not which elſe it can.</p>

               <p>The truth is (how ſtrange ſoever it may ſeeme to be) that <hi>Adam</hi> worſhipped God in Paradiſe toward the Eaſt, and ſo did the whole world till <hi>Abrahams</hi> time.</p>
               <p>The Hebrewes deliver that God <hi>created Adam with his face towards the Eaſt.</hi> I cannot tell that, but that he was no ſooner diſpatcht out of the duſt, but he fell downe to the ſame earth againe, and adored his maker this ſame way, there is this great probability.</p>

called <hi>Mizrach, i. e.</hi> the <hi>riſing,</hi> the Weſt, <hi>Maarab;</hi> that is, the <hi>ſetting</hi> of the <hi>Sunne</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But in the <hi>Holy way</hi> the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is called <hi>Kedem,</hi> that is, the face or fore-part, the <hi>Weſt Achor,</hi> the backe-part.

               <p>Indeed <hi>Kedem</hi> properly ſignifieth not the face, but that which is before the face. It is the ſame with <hi>Kibla</hi> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabicke.

               </p>
               <p>I know there be that will tell you, that the reaſon of this <hi>Impoſition</hi> was the <hi>Shecina bammaarab</hi> or ſitting of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence upon the Arke in the Weſterne part of the Tabernacle and Temple with his face towards the Eaſt; as if theſe names had not beene impoſed long before the Arke was knowne or thought of in the world, Nay <hi>before Abraham was, theſe were,</hi> and yet this paſſeth with ſome ſot a very happy Criticiſme.</p>
               <p>But however, that not onely <hi>Adam,</hi> but the whole world alſo worſhipped towards the Eaſt till <hi>Abraham's</hi> time, my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are not onely <hi>Maimon</hi> in his <hi>More,</hi> but the great Saint <hi>Ephrem</hi> alſo and others in the Arabicke <hi>Catena.</hi> The Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>The other reaſon is this.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid before, that from <hi>Adam</hi> till <hi>Abrahams</hi> time the whole world worſhipped towards the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>This Originall, Principall, and (as it ought to have beene) everlaſting Ceremonie, by an Errour of the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daean</hi> worſhippers, degenerating into an Idolatry to the Sun, <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſaith the learned <hi>Maimon) by the inſtincts of God appointed out the Weſt to his Hebrewes.</hi> Therefore the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and Temple were ſet towards that ſide of Heaven, God in the meane time ſeeming to leave his miſtaken place in the Eaſt, and come downe to this ſtiffe-necked people.

                  </note>their faces the ſame way. The pile ſet up for the <hi>Phara adumma</hi> or Red Cow was to have windowes in it, and the proſpect of theſe was to be towards the Weſt. <hi>Talmud. in Phara<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fol.</hi> 96. <hi>a.</hi>

moſt holy place, and that it was called the <hi>Weſterne Lampe. Beth habbech: C:</hi> 3. §. 8.</p>
               <p>But all this while they worſhipped no more towards the Weſt, then towards the North. They worſhipped towards the Arke (it was told you before) or towards the place of that. They do ſo ſtill. And they were, and they are to do ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the Sun of Righteousneſſe was to ſet upon their Horizon.

               <p>If our Saviour aſcended into Heaven by the Eaſterne part, we need not doubt but that he will returne by the ſame way which he went. The Angels intimate as much. I meet with an Author which teſtifieth that he himſelf ſaid that he would <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Therefore that <hi>ſigne</hi> of the Sonne of Man, that other Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt as it were of his ſecond coming, is expected to be ſeene in the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>A ſigne of the Croſſe it is to be, as the Fathers <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and Saint <hi>Ephrem</hi> promiſe. And the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Church is ſo ſure of it, that (as their <hi>Zabo</hi> ſaith) it is profeſt among the Articles of their Creed.

               </p>
               <p>Conſidering all theſe things, I am altogether of their minde who perſwade themſelves that the Seate and Tribunall of that laſt Judgement ſhall be placed in the Aire over againſt the <hi>Mount Olivet.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Joel</hi> the Prophet is thought to have foretold as much, when he ſaith that all Nations ſhall be gathered into the valley of <hi>Jehoſaphat;</hi> and his feet ſhall ſtand in that day upon the Mount Olivet; which is before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> towards the Eaſt. I cannot deviſe (ſaith one) for what reaſon the Prophet ſhould make ſo particular a Deſcription of this unto them that knew it ſo well. It is certaine, ſaith another, <hi>ſpectare haec ad diem ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicii, that theſe things are to be meant of the day of judgement,</hi> &amp;c. And if <hi>Clemens</hi> may be truſted, the Apoſtles themſelves underſtood no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Our Fore-Fathers lived and dyed in this hope.

But now to make way for that ſenſe which the <hi>Prohibition</hi> indeed intendeth to, I thinke fit to lay downe <hi>theſe grounds;</hi> And they are ſuch as will need to be taken better notice of by thoſe that hereafter ſhall undertake to tell the meaning of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>Know then from Him that knew it beſt and firſt (the moſt learned <hi>Maimon)</hi> that the praecepts in the Law, thoſe of this kinde eſpecially, are ſtill ſet downe with a reflex upon the <hi>Heather Rites,</hi> and not thoſe onely of <hi>ſimple Idolatry,</hi> but moſt of all ſuch as were complicated with <hi>Magicall</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Superſtition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is the <hi>Reſpect</hi> of theſe Lawes ſo large and indiſtinct, as to looke upon all the <hi>Heathen</hi> in Groſſe, but referring pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to that neighbouring part of <hi>Paganiſme</hi> profeſſed by the <hi>Aegyptians, Canaanites. Chaldaeans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Amorites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Superſtitions were termed by the Ancient Rabbines <hi>Viae Amorhaeorum, the way of the Amorites,</hi> that is wayes which the Iewes were bound to call <hi>Hereſie.</hi> Otherwiſe they were called <hi>Zabiorum</hi> or <hi>Zabaiſtarum Cultus.</hi> i. e. The <hi>Eaſterne Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Rites</hi> the <hi>Zabii</hi> had written in many bookes; a good part of which were tranſlated into Arabick, and theſe <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> made uſe of, as the <hi>Sepher Hatteleſmaoth</hi> or booke of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſmes. <hi>Sepher Haſharab, Sepher Tamtam, Sepher Maaloth hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galgal, Sepher Iſaaci.</hi> Abooke of <hi>Iſaacke</hi> the <hi>Zabiiſt</hi> of all the Rites and Cuſtomes of their Law. But the booke of greateſt account, ſaith <hi>Maimon,</hi> is the <hi>Sepher Avoda Henbattith,</hi> or <hi>liber de Agri-Cultura Aegyptiorum.</hi> By this booke you may judge of the reſt, and of this by a ſtrange paſſage quoted out of it in the <hi>Sepher Haccozri</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> i. e <hi>or as the Bookes of the Avoda Henbattith, which make mention of ſome certaine names, Ianboſhar, Tſagarith and Roani, and they ſay that theſe (men) were before Adams time, and that Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſhar was Adams Tutor. &amp;c. Cozri: lib.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:113683:61"/>
Out of theſe <hi>Zabian</hi> bookes, this latter eſpecially, <hi>Maimon</hi> made good the greateſt part of the Ceremoniall Law, and which is more made it familiar too, and reconcil'd the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thoſe precepts to any mans proportion of reaſon and beleife. Onely about the caſe of wine why God would have that uſed in ſacrifice, ſeeing that the <hi>Zabii</hi> did ſo too, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelfe to be very much troubled, and not knowing how to referre it.</p>
               <p>Yet he giveth a reaſon from ſome others, that God with a Reſpect had to the 3 principall parts of man, The <hi>Heart,</hi> the <hi>Liver,</hi> and the <hi>Braine,</hi> would have his ſacrifices be made up of three anſwerable things, <hi>Fleſh, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Muſicke, More: part.</hi> 3. <hi>c:</hi> 46.</p>
               <p>But in other caſes the prohibition in the Law (for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part) lyes againſt ſome Rite or other of <hi>Magicall Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So from this prohibition in the Law <hi>Lev:</hi> 19. 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſow thy field with mingled ſeed, nor thy vineyard. Deut:</hi> 22. 9. The Hebrew Doctours lawfully conclude, that all divers kindes of Trees are to be meant as much. As to graft one Tree upon another of another kinde. And <hi>Maimon</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this backe upon the wayes of the <hi>Amorhites.</hi> For the <hi>Zabii (ſaith he)</hi> uſed ſo to do, <hi>They obſerved ſuch a place of the Moone, made ſuch a ſuffumigation, uttered ſuch and ſuch words at the grafting of one Tree upon another aſſuring, themſelves that thoſe Rites were neceſſary to fructification. More part:</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>I ſhould thinke that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had an eye upon this, when he tells his <hi>Amorite</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> that he was <hi>but cut off from the wilde Olive, and grafted contrary to Nature</hi> (that is the wayes of the Iewes) into a good Olive Tree. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. As things ſtood before, ſo heterogeneous a branch might not be inſerted, but now Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> caſe. He was not to call any thing <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maimon</hi> repeateth there another practice of theirs to the ſame purpoſe, but ſuch a one as will uncover too much if it be rendered in our words.</p>
               <p>But the fitteſt inſtance to this end is from the <hi>Lawes of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:113683:61"/>
blood.</hi> It is forbidden there that any man of <hi>Iſraël</hi> ſhould eate blood.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is commanded that the Blood be ſprin ckled upon the Altar, and moreover that it be covered with duſt, or ſprinckled upon the ground as water.</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Zabii</hi> did uſe to eate the blood, ſome others who reckoned this to inhumanity, at the killing of a Beaſt reſerved the blood, and gathered it up into a veſſell or trench, and then ſitting downe in a Circle about the blood they are up the fleſh, and ſatisfied themſelves with an opinion that their <hi>Daemons</hi> fed upon the blood, entertaining a ſtrong conceipt that this manner of ſitting at the ſame Table with their Gods would engage them to a nearer tie of converſation and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, and promiſing to themſelves alſo that theſe ſpirits would infinuate themſelves in dreames and render them capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Prophecy and things to come.</p>
               <p>In reference to theſe <hi>wayes of the Amorites,</hi> God expreſſely forbad his people to eate blood, for ſo ſome of the <hi>Zabii</hi> did; and to meet with others who gathered it up into a Veſſell, he commanded that the blood ſhould be ſpilt upon the ground like water.</p>
               <p>And becauſe they ate their ſacrifices in a Circle round about the blood. He alſo commanded that the Blood ſhould be ſprinckled (not about but) upon the Altar.</p>
               <p>So here it is forbidden to any man of <hi>Iſraël</hi> to ſeeth a Kid <hi>in the milke of the Damme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is certaine that this muſt reſpect to ſome Idolatrous Rite of the Heathen, for to take any other courſe with it is not to tell the meaning, but to make a ſhift with the place.</p>
               <p>Here to hope for any ſuch cuſtome to be found of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in groſſe, the labour hath beene ſufficiently loſt already.</p>

Milke alſo was among the Sacrifices of <hi>Pan</hi> the God of the Shepheards, and the ſame was offered to <hi>Ceres</hi> in the <hi>Ambarvalia.</hi> There is reaſon alſo why a Goate and Goats milke ſhould be of Reverent importance in the Heathen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, for <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelfe ſuckt no other milke then this.

               <p>One <hi>Simler</hi> noteth, that ſome of the Hebrewes ſay, that the <hi>Iſmaëlites</hi> uſed to ſeeth a Kid in Milke. 'Tis true indeed deed <hi>Abarbinel</hi> ſaith they do ſo <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>By the <hi>Iſmaëlites</hi> we are to underſtand the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that is the <hi>Saracens</hi> before, and the Turkes now. And yet in whoſe Ritualiſts as <hi>Ben Caſem, Side Ben Hali, Abdalla</hi> &amp;c. if you finde any ſuch thing, it will be more then could be expected from them that have looked for it too.</p>
               <p>That they eate Milke and Goates fleſh alſo I know, ſo doe we too: And what then?</p>
               <p>If they did to the Text here, they are to ſeeth a Kid in Milke, which is more I thinke then the beſt man in the Kitchin will undertake to do, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The firſt words beare a troubleſome ſence, and the laſt are ſo plainely Magicall, that of themſelves they prevent any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of interpretation. Therefore <hi>Abarbinel</hi> made his recourſe thus farre this way, as to thinke that it was an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Rite of the Heathen, To ſeeth a Kid in Milke at the time of in-gathering of fruits, hoping by this to propitiate their Gods.</p>
               <p>And he pretendeth as for a ground for his meaning the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

               </p>
               <p>But to eate <hi>Kid</hi> or <hi>milke,</hi> or both, is a continuall Nothing to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The very words themſelves inſtantly import a Magicall preparation. Therefore the very learned <hi>Maimon,</hi> though he interpret this place for company as the ordinary Iewes do, yet he doubted not to caſt it upon <hi>the way of the Amorites,</hi> for this reaſon, becauſe he findes it twice annext to the 3 anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary turnes in the yeare, <hi>Exod:</hi> 23. 19 34. 26. <hi>Tribus vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus conſpicietur omnis maſculus tuus,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>The Magicall preparation of a Kid hath a plaine reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Seirim</hi> or Goat-Divells. But for the reaſons of the manner they cannot be given, for then it were not Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</p>

God. Alſo it may very well be thought that the People of God themſelves (ſome of them) drew downe this Example of the <hi>Zabii</hi> into their owne practiſe. Why not this as well as ſacrificing to the <hi>Seirim</hi> or <hi>Devill-Goats. Levit.</hi> 17. 7? If the people of God did ſo, that is <hi>ſeeth a Kid in the milke of the Damme,</hi> to haſten the maturation of their Fruits, then this was the reaſon why the Prohibition is ſo often repeated in the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maimon</hi> quoteth a like practiſe of the <hi>Zabii</hi> out of their booke <hi>Avoda Henbattith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They putrified certaine things <hi>(which the booke nameth)</hi> having obſerved when the Sunne was in this or that degree. They performed ſome Magicall operations, and ſo went away with this perſwaſion, that whoſoever ſhould be ſprinckle a new planted Tree with this charme, the Tree would fructifie in a ſhorter time then otherwiſe it would have done.</p>
               <p>This affordeth another likelihood for the <hi>Karraites</hi> Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeething a Kid &amp;c. that this alſo was to be found in the <hi>Zabians</hi> bookes, though the learned <hi>Maimon</hi> had not yet met with it.</p>

               <p>According to the firſt Modell of the Creation the ſtories of this <hi>Great Pile</hi> ſtood not as now they doe. <hi>The Earth was without Forme and voide, i. e.</hi> (as ſome would have it, but I have told you the meaning of it before) unbecomed with that glorious furniture which now it hath, ſtanding all cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with a Globe of waters vaſtly extending, which <hi>the Maker</hi> did, to ſhew that <hi>the Earth was his before he gave it to the Children of Men,</hi> Pſal. 115. 16.</p>
               <p>Here he might have ſtaid his hand reflecting upon himſelfe this <hi>Mighty Power</hi> which could ſettle ſuch a ponderous maſſe upon it ſelfe.

               </p>
               <p>The waters below this Firmament he commanded to gather together, which made the <hi>Seas.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And the dry land appeared.</hi> Not now ſo preciſely globous as before, but recompenced with an extuberancy of Hils and Mountaines for the <hi>Receipts</hi> into which he had ſunke the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

               <p>For to lay the charge of this huge effect unto the Starres, or any Conjunction of the Superiour Bodies, as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Albumazar</hi> did, is not to releaſe, but entangle the Wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For beſides that thoſe <hi>Lights</hi> above are not intruſted with ſo unlimited a power, no not in their ſtrongeſt conſpiracies of

Influence, the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> tyed the <hi>Coniuction</hi> to a falſe time, as the Learned <hi>Mirandula</hi> fully enough, though himſelfe not ſo truely, hath declared againſt them.</p>

               <p>And yet the ſame <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> foretold of a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge to be at ſuch a time in the <hi>Deſerts</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which (if the <hi>Story</hi> mock not) proved true; for the <hi>Pilgrimes</hi> to <hi>Mecca</hi> (ſo that ſaith) were drowned upon thoſe Sands, where others before time had periſhed for want of waters.</p>
               <p>And to give up that account which the Common People in Philoſophy uſe to doe, that theſe <hi>mighty waters</hi> could be emptyed out of the <hi>bottles of Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Cloudes</hi> whatſoever or Condenſations of Aire runneth us a ground upon a ridiculous courſe in Nature, or indecent in Miracle; whereas if we betake our ſelves to this other way, one onely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Omnipotency</hi> will ſerve the turne, to force downe the motion of theſe waters by a <hi>high Hand,</hi> which otherwiſe according to <hi>Received Nature</hi> muſt have beene more then 100 yeares in falling.</p>
               <p>What if it rained 40 Dayes and 40 Nights, had it rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 40 yeares what could this have done towards ſuch a heape of flouds as <hi>prevailed above the higheſt mountaines</hi> 15 <hi>Cubits upwards?</hi> be their perpendicular height taken after the moſt moderate eſtimation.</p>
               <p>So that in juſtice of reaſon we may conclude, that theſe <hi>Decumani fluctus</hi> could not be raiſed without a ſupply from this <hi>great Abyſſe;</hi> and unleſſe <hi>one depth had called another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelfe confeſſeth as much, that the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Tehom Rabba or this great Deepe,</hi> or (as the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:113683:70"/>

               <p>And at the abatement of theſe waters when <hi>God remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Noah,</hi> the ſame Fountaines of this <hi>Deepe</hi> are ſaid to have beene ſtopped <hi>Gen:</hi> 38. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which can admit of no other (but a miraculous) ſe nſe; for we cannot underſtand it of any ſubterraneous Abyſſe, without an open defiance to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Nature.</p>
               <p>Therefore betwixt the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Heaven of Heavens</hi> there muſt be a <hi>Tehom Rabbah,</hi> or <hi>great Deepe,</hi> and for this it is that he is ſaid to have layed the Beames of his <hi>Chambers</hi> in the waters. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 104. 3. His upper Chambers it ſhould be (as the <hi>Saxon</hi> rightly) and it maketh very much for the matter, for it will follow from this that theſe Chambers were the Heaven of Heavens.

               <p>And he is ſaid to have watered the Hills from theſe Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 13. Not from the <hi>middle Region</hi> of the <hi>Aire,</hi> for the Tops of ſome Hills <hi>(whoſe heights are his. Pſal.</hi> 95. 4.) are lifted up above all the Clouds. But he watered the Hils from this great Abyſſe, when at the floud thoſe Cataracts of Heaven were opened.</p>

               <p>I am allmoſt perſwaded to thinke, that untill <hi>Noahs</hi> time <hi>The Lord God had not cauſed it to raine upon the Earth, but a miſt went up and watered the whole face of the ground. Gen.</hi> 2. 5, 6. And a River went forth of <hi>Eden</hi> to water the Garden

               <p>It is no ſtranger a thing then to finde the whole Earth in ſuch a caſe for that time as the Land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> hath beene ever ſince, or thoſe everlaſting Hills which (the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> ſet out) were never yet <hi>wetted with the dew of Heaven.</hi> If it be otherwiſe how could he then firſt ſet his Bow in the Cloud? for as <hi>Porphyrie</hi> ſaid it muſt have beene there before.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that proportioning the perpendicular height of the Mountaines to the Semidiameter of the Earth, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder but that this Aboundance of Waters ſupplyed from the Springs above the Firmament might be ſunke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cavernes of the Earth, from whence it hath beene up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion called forth by the heate and influence of the Hoſt of Heaven.

Here I ſhall need to make you a Note or two as concerning this Prayer. It may poſſibly ſeeme ſtrange to you, that this oraiſon ſhould be ſo dayly ſaid before the body of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To take you off from that you muſt know that it is a moſt confeſt Tradition among the Eaſterne men (and Saint <hi>Ephrem</hi> himſelfe is very principall in the Authority) that Adam was commanded by God (and left the ſame in charge to his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) that his dead Body ſhould be kept above ground till a fullneſſe of time ſhould come to commit it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the <hi>middle of the Earth</hi> by a Preiſt of the moſt high God.</p>

                  <hi>For</hi> Adam <hi>prophecied this reaſon for it,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>that</hi> there ſhould be the Redeemer of him and all his Poſterity.</p>
               <p>The Preiſt who was to officiate at this Funerall they ſay was <hi>Melchiſedec.</hi> and that he buried this body at <hi>Salem,</hi> which might very well be the middle of the habitable world as then, and that it was indeed ſo afterwards, it hath beene told you before.</p>
               <p>Therefore (as they ſay) this body of <hi>Adam</hi> was embalmed and tranſmitted from Father to Sonne by a Reverend and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious way of conveighance, till at laſt it was delivered up by <hi>Lamech</hi> into the hands of <hi>Noah.</hi> who being well adviſed of that faſhion of the old world, which was to worſhip God toward a certaine place, and conſidering with himſelfe that this could not be towards the Right (which was the Eaſt) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inconſtancy and inconvenience of a Ship, appointed out the middle of the Arke for the <hi>place of Prayer,</hi> and made it as Holy as he could by the Reverend preſence of <hi>Adams</hi> Body.</p>
               <p>Towards this place therefore the prayer was ſaid, not as terminating any the leaſt moment of Divine worſhip in the body (it were a ſtupid thing to think ſo) but (where it ought to be, and where all worſhippers doe, or ſhould do ſo) in God himſelfe and onely him, as the very Tradition diſtinctly cleareth the caſe. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>OF the interruption of the Soules Immortality, betwixt the moment of Death (it muſt not now be call'd Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is the inſidious debate of theſe eager dayes. A fitter and more congeneall time to bring this Monſter to the Birth, (though there is not ſtrength to bring forth) was never yet endeavoured to be wreſted out of the hands of Providence, by the greateſt deepeneſſe of Satan.</p>
               <p>The familiar that convers'd ſo much with <hi>Cardan</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>But if the Beaſts and we have all one breath, then why doe not their Spirits too returne to God that gave them. If Incorruption have put Corruption on, we may very well eate and drinke as we doe, for to morrow we dye indeed.</p>
               <p>The unlikely Heathen ploughed in more hope then ſo, In Hieroglyphicall learning, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> ſet downe the <hi>Axis</hi> of a <hi>Pyramis</hi> for the Soule, and therefore the Figure of their Sepulchers was Pyramidall. The myſtery is Geometricall, that as by the converſion or turning about of a Pyramid upon his Axis, the Axis remaining ſtill the ſame, there is a Mathematicall creation of a new Solid or Cone, ſo by the Revolution of a certaine time of yeeres about the Soule (the ſoule continuing ſtill the ſame in a conſtant courſe of immortality) A new body ſhall ariſe and reunite againe.</p>

               <p>I am induced to beleive that without any further ſubtility or arrogancy of diſpute, there is an invincible argument for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:113683:75"/>
the thing ſecretly imprinted in the Inſtinct and Conſcience of the Soule it ſelfe, becauſe 'tis every good man's hope that it ſhall be ſo, and every wicked man's feare that it will. And that at leaſt a parcell judgement may preſently be pronounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>wandring Soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However the oportunity of this part of Scripture doth not ſo directly call upon me to any ſuch kinde of Controverſie. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I would be taken to be ſo ſecure of the Soules Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that I am going about to leave the Body it ſelfe in a very faire Condition of Incorruption. And I ſee not but that it may very well ſuite with the Immoderations of the time to advance up the Immortality of the Body, when men have ſo little to doe as to raiſe ſuſpicions upon that of the Soule.</p>
               <p>The Jewes commonly expreſſe Reſurrection by Regermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or growing up againe like a Plant. So they doe in that ſtrange Tradition of theirs, of the <hi>Luz</hi> an immortall little Bone in the Bottome of the <hi>Spina dorſi;</hi> which though our Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts are bound to deride as a kind of <hi>Terra incognita</hi> in the Leſſer world, yet theirs, (who know the Bones too, but by Tradition) will tell ye that there it is, and that it was created by God in an unalterable ſtate of incorruption, that it is of a ſlippery condition and maketh the Body but beleive that it groweth up with, or receiveth any nouriſhment from that. Whereas indeed the <hi>Luz</hi> is every wayes immortally diſpos'd, and out of whoſe everliving <hi>Power</hi> fermented by a kinde of dew from Heaven all the dry Bones ſhall be renuited and knit together, and the whole Generation of mankinde recruite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
               <p>There is a better temper and holding a more lawfull corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency in that Rite of theirs, which of old they obſerved, and ſtill doe at their Funerall Celebrations.</p>

               <p>To make this good by the Experiment, they take a Roſe, Gillyflower, or any kinde of Plant whatſoever. They take this Simple in the Spring time, in its fulleſt and moſt vigorous conſiſtence. They beate the whole Plant in a Mortar, Rootes, Stalkes, Flowres, Leaves and all, till it be reduced to a confuſed Maſſe. Then after <hi>Maceration, Fermentation, Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and other workings of Art, there is extracted a kind of Aſhes or Salt including theſe Formes and Tinctures under their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Chaos.</hi> Theſe <hi>Aſhes</hi> are put up in Glaſſes, written upon with the ſeverall names of the Hearbs or Plants, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Hermetically, that is, the mouth of the Glaſſe heated in the fire, and then the Necke wrung about cloſe, which they call the <hi>Seal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

perceive the Hearbs or Plants by little and little to riſe up againe out of their Salt or Aſhes in their ſeverall proper Formes, ſpringing up as at firſt (but in a ſhorter time) they did in the Feild.

The wonder of this is farre above that of the Reſurrection of our bodies, for then the Earth giveth up her dead but one for one, but in the caſe of the Corne ſhe giveth up many living ones for one dead one. O the intolerable madneſſe of unbeleiving men! They ſee that the Earth giveth up to the Husbandman that which it received not, and ſhould it be accounted among the impoſſible things that the ſame Earth ſhould ſurrender up (to the Creatour too) that which ſhe hath received in pawne? <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>That which ſeemeth to be wanting to the Authority of this ſtrange thing is, that there ſhould be no ordinary memory (none at all I can meete with yet) of the matter in any of their owne Bookes.

In any other Bookes of theirs, and ſome likely ones too, I meete not with any notice at all. And yet as to that I can retort this anſwer upon my ſelfe, that a thing of ſo cheape and common beleife amongſt them could not fitly be expected to be written out as a rarety by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſent forth into theſe unbeleiving Corners of the world. Which though it may paſſe for a reaſon why there ſhould not be any ſuch common report of the thing, yet leaveth me ſcope to thinke, that there is ſome ſpeciall mention of it in the Arabicke or Copticke Hiſtories, which when it ſhall be met with, if it be found to referre up the Wonder to ſome excellent and important Originall, it will the better defend this matter of Fact, from the opinion of impoſture.</p>

               <p>But what have I to do with another mans ſervant? The worſt you can ſay by theſe men, is, that they have not the knowledge of Chriſt, but we ſay we know him, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict our ſelves againe, by doing the workes of our father the Devill.

               <p>You know who ſaid it, that the Chriſtian Religion had beene the cauſe of all the diſtractions in theſe parts of the World, I am ſure it hath beene the pretence, and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled by private intereſt, and crooked to ingagements of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ones particular, we may find in all other ſtates as we now feele in our owne.</p>
               <p>As we make it, Religion is indeed but a politique engine of State, as uſefull for the battery as defence, and as equally tractable to the Ruine as to the conſervation of a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> neceſſary to the turning of affaires here below, but of no concernment to the other world.</p>
               <p>If it be any thing elſe why doth every man profeſſe it to a ſcope and end of his owne, and never brings in God but by the by? Why do we give the Enemies of God every day new occaſion to blaſpeme? Why do we come hither to ſee our Faces in this mirrour of the word, and ſtraightway forget what manner of men we were? Breifly why do we live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, and die without Wiſedome.</p>

to weepe, but never once to laugh, much leſſe, that <hi>Saturne</hi> with <hi>Venus</hi> could make him to have a mole in his Face. He quoteth <hi>Ioſephus</hi> for theſe two laſt accidents, but you will not finde it there. That excellent Author giveth indeed a very grave &amp; honourable Teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> booke of his Antiquities, but without any ſuch mentions as theſe.</p>
               <p>But ſtill I do but hold you in hand.</p>
               <p>That which I may lawfully and innocently obſerve in the <hi>Scheme</hi> of our Lords Nativity concerneth thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt the ☉ of Righteouſneſſe was very fitly borne in <hi>Libra,</hi> the ſigne and Conſtellation of Juſtice. Next to this the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers <hi>Horoſcope</hi> was quite contrary to that of the World. The Aſcendent of the Creation was <hi>Aries,</hi> for the World was created in the Spring, as to the poſition of <hi>Iudea.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtay to prove it here, I have done it elſewhere.</p>
               <p>But much above all this there fell out at this time a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction (the greateſt that can be) of the 8 and 9 Spheares in the Head of <hi>Aries.</hi> From whence it will follow that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as at the beginning of this world the <hi>Aſteriſmes</hi> were all out of their proper places, (it pleaſed God to have it ſo) now at the <hi>reſtitution</hi> of the world, they were all found in their owne diviſions. It is an <hi>appeareance</hi> of that kinde which nature can ſhew the World but once. The ſame Figure of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens never could before, nor never can fall out agen, unleſſe the World ſhould unreaſonably laſt againſt all Chriſtian expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, by the moſt moderate Account, for if you caſt about the ſlow Revolution of this period, it will trouble you to call theſe or allmoſt any other the <hi>latter dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The period according to ſome is to finiſh a Circle of 30, if not 40 thouſand yeares.</p>
               <p>This great yeare began at our Saviours Nativity, but for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to expect that it ſhould ever have an end, as to us and this World, cannot be thought of, but upon grounded A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme and abſurdity.</p>
               <p>I have onely one thing here to confeſſe, that this figure of our Saviours Nativity is erected according to the <hi>Dionyſian</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:113683:90"/>
rate of account, which uſeth to be called <hi>Vulgare initium an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum Domini. The vulgar Epoche of the yeares of Chriſt,</hi> but demonſtrated to be falſe (as they themſelves doubt not) by <hi>Mercator, Chriſtmannus, Ioſeph Scaliger, Sethus Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Suſlyga</hi> the <hi>Polonian,</hi> and others, Maſters all in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Chronology; ſome of them demonſtrate that this <hi>Aera</hi> is falſe by one yeare, ſome by two, others by three, the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> by foure, and ſome others by five. But when I ſaw that there could be ſo many <hi>true Accompts,</hi> I thought it beſt to ſit downe and abide by <hi>the old falſe one,</hi> as well in reverence to the Tradition of the Church, as for the rare appearances in the Scheme it ſelfe, ſufficient of their owne ſtrength to evidence, that this was the time both for the yeare and day, though rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Tradition ſhould pretend againſt it.</p>
               <p>And becauſe there be ſome (and ſome too that know not why they do it neither) who continue to call in queſtion the Antiquity and truth of this day, I will put in a little more weight into their Scale who have very well aſſured this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter already both by <hi>hiſtoricall</hi> tradition and <hi>Mathematicall</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>

               <p>'Tis a fearefull thing too to fall <hi>out</hi> of the hands of God. The Imaginations of mens hearts are only evill and continually, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> the Spirit of God doth not alwaies ſtrive with them, <hi>if it did,</hi> our Spirit would faint under him, and the Soules which he hath made.</p>

                  <hi>If a man doe ſtart aſide</hi> (as we all and often doe) <hi>like a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Bow,</hi> God puts us together againe and faſtens us unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as ſoone, and taking as good hold as he can.</p>
               <p>And theſe things <hi>(ſaith Holy</hi> Job) God will doe once and twice, <hi>that is,</hi> oft times for a man.</p>
               <p>To day if we will heare his voice. To day, <hi>that is,</hi> whenſoever a ſinner, &amp;c. He will turne and repent, his heart will be turned <note place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 8.</note>within him, and his Repentings rouled together.</p>
               <p>And all this that our hearts may not be hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſinne.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Our other back-ſlidings and <hi>variations</hi> from him, how wide and diſtant ſoever, yet may be thought to be but like thoſe of the <hi>Compaſſe,</hi> more or leſſe according to a leſſe or greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of <hi>earthly mindedneſſe,</hi> but this is like to that of

               </p>
               <p>That it ſhould be wanting in <hi>ſome others</hi> is the leſſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe it is not to be found in that <hi>Vetuſtiſſimus Codex</hi> given by himſelfe to the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is not a <hi>full booke</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> but conteining only the <hi>foure Goſpels</hi> and the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> The Booke is written as well in Latine as Greeke, but both in the ſame greeke Character<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it is that of the <hi>great Capitall</hi>

               <p>In this booke the <hi>Clauſe</hi> is not to be found (ſo farre as poſſibly I can remember) either in the Greeke or Latine.</p>
               <p>I had occaſion once to ſay as much as this amounts to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt Reverend and Learned the Primate of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and the <hi>Doctour of our Chaire</hi> the now worthy <hi>Biſhop of Worceſter,</hi> but was forc't to yeild to ſo great a <hi>preſence</hi> with this only anſwer, that even this <hi>Copie</hi> too was corrupted by the <hi>Heretiques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I knew it might be and deny not but it may in ſome other part of <hi>Genealogy</hi> or the like, but how any <hi>Haereſie</hi> could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſerve its turne upon this <hi>Clauſe</hi> (I know that of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) at leaſt to me the way doth not ſo eaſily approve it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe the <hi>Syriacke</hi> hath it, but I know not what then.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arabicke</hi> hath it too, not onely the printed Copie by <hi>Erpenius,</hi> but a Manuſcript too of very <hi>good and gallant note</hi> in <hi>Queenes Colledge Library.</hi> Yet in <hi>the Medicean Copie</hi> I do not meet with it.

But this is not materiall enough. Indeed the <hi>Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> formes of prayer are more for, then againſt the thing.

               <p>The whole engagement of the Latine Church againſt this Clauſe though very ſtrong and preponderating. I let alone.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to goe for this Doxology.
