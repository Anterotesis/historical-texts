            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>By a most Learned and Reverend Divine now with God.</p>

            <head>The Publisher to the Reader.</head>
            <p>AT this time of day when the Reverend and Learned <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> are so great Ornaments of the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and so justly admir'd for their performances in Preaching; he that would take upon him to instruct them how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves in it, had need be a very wonderful and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Person for Learning and Authority; or else he will be thought to charge himself with a most invidious and vain glorious <hi>Task.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Author</hi> of the following <hi>Tract</hi> was well known to be such a Person, a man of great Reverence and Learning, and worthily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd for a <hi>Principal Governor</hi> in this <hi>Church,</hi> if it had pleas'd God to spare us so great a Blessing a little longer. And therefore it should not be thought any great presumption, to set down His sence of the <hi>Clergies</hi> Duty: Especially in a matter that does not touch on the preaching part, but concerns only <hi>Discipline,</hi> and is neglected by most (as himself thought it was) through mistake of its <hi>bad consequences,</hi> or by Inadvertency of the <hi>Law</hi> that has enjoyn'd it.</p>
            <p>For some years both before and since this Copy came to my hands, I have observ'd in many places, and especially about <hi>London,</hi> a great disuse of the practice here contended for: And having discours'd with several concerning it, I must needs say I have not been yet so fortunate, as to meet with any Reasons sufficient (in my Iudgment) to justify the Common practice, or to outweigh my <hi>Author's</hi> arguments against it.</p>
            <p>I know that the <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Canon</hi> cited by him, (<hi>viz,</hi> 55. <hi>primo Jacobi</hi>) runs thus <hi>Precationis</hi> Forma <hi>à Concionatoribus in concio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num suarum Ingressu</hi> imitanda, but I am not convinc'd that the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Canon</hi> is fullfil'd when the matter of it is turn'd into the <hi>proper Form</hi> of a Prayer: Because we are hereby oblig'd to <hi>follow this very Form,</hi> which is plainly the <hi>Form of Bidding Prayer,</hi> the word being all along <hi>precamini,</hi> and not <hi>precemur.</hi> And in the Beginning 'tis, <hi>populum hortabuntur</hi> they shall <hi>move</hi> or <hi>exhort</hi> the People to pray, but not pray with them till the Conclusion: So that the next words <hi>I<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hunc aut similem modum</hi> may not be understood of changing the <hi>Form of Bidding Prayer</hi> into a <hi>formal direct Prayer,</hi> but barely to allow a Liberty of altering only the words, so as may be suitable to any Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occasion, or particular Circumstance, keeping still to this <hi>Form</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51072:3"/>
in the nature of an <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Wherefore seeing 'tis so praescrib'd by <hi>K. Edw.</hi> 6th. by <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi> and here by <hi>K. James</hi>; and <hi>ratify'd</hi> since by the succeeding <hi>Powers</hi> a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> not repeal'd by any later <hi>Constitutions</hi>; I see no reason why it may safely be dispenc't with, unless we infer from the general usage, that there is in this case a <hi>Tacit Consent</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But I don't find why the <hi>Church</hi> should be thought to Agree and Consent privily, to that which she has <hi>Decreed</hi> otherwise in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick manner. And however she may Connive, or tolerate, or forbear to punish Offenders; yet this will in no case acquit them of the guilt. Besides there is the less ground to Argue upon the <hi>Churches Consent,</hi> because many Eminent <hi>Church-men</hi> that should share in it, have declar'd themselves of this <hi>Authors</hi> opinion and do practice accordingly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dissenters</hi> tho' they hate nothing (but <hi>Monarchy</hi> perhaps) more than our Establisht <hi>Uniformity</hi> yet are so fond of any pretence against us; that of late they have had the hardiness to Tax the Conforming Clergy with the <note n="*" place="margin">Alsop <hi>against Dr.</hi> St. Hickringil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> Breach of it, in matters (as of less moment, and not so ill consequence as this here treated of, so) much more Difficult, if not impossible, to be remedied. And I am told, the Popish Faction hath taken hold of the very same occasion to bespatter and revile our <hi>Discipline.</hi> And farther, I know many Regular and sound <hi>Divines</hi> that both use this <hi>Form of Bidding Prayer,</hi> and no other, and are also dissatisfy'd with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>such as do not use it: so that <hi>such</hi> would do well either to shew good reasons why they disuse it, and to make those Reasons as publick as this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Or else to Testify their Conviction by the use of it. For if my <hi>Authors</hi> proofs stand firm and unshaken, their contrary Custom or their great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, will not justify them in the other practice. How long soever they have been in the wrong, 'tis no shame at last to yield Obedience to the <hi>Truth</hi> and to the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if they make it appear against this <hi>Author,</hi> that they are in the Right, or that 'tis but a matter of meer Indifferency whether we use this or another Form, tis hop'd that the Rest of the Clergy may follow their way for <hi>Uniformity's</hi> sake: Or, that whether they do or no; yet neither they, nor the People may be Scandaliz'd if both ways be prov'd <hi>Lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no other Design in the Publication of this paper than to procure a strict Conformity in the practice of the matter in hand, or a General satisfaction to such as are Scrupulous about it.</p>
            <p>I shall say no more but only give notice that the <hi>Authors</hi> words are kept entire in the Body of the Text: The marginal notes being added by the publisher, to make his meaning clear, and to ease the <hi>Reader</hi> in perusal of his <hi>Citations</hi> by referring directly to their places.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Seeing therefore both the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly enjoyned us to use no <hi>Publick Prayers</hi> but the <hi>Liturgy</hi> [Except his Majesty give special leave, upon some <hi>extraordinary</hi> occasion, for the drawing up of <hi>Forms,</hi> which leave has ground <hi>de jure Communi</hi> both <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi>] it follows, that neither <hi>Church</hi> nor <hi>State</hi> have given power to any to vent Themselves in such <hi>Open</hi> Prayers <hi>in the Church</hi>; because they Expresly <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid</hi> it.</p>
            <p>To presume then to use such prayers contains in it a <hi>Complication</hi> of several <hi>Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, A sin of <hi>Falshood</hi> or the breach of a <hi>Solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> confirmed by <hi>Subscription,</hi> to the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is an Act of <hi>Disobedience</hi> to the <hi>Higher Powers</hi>; and so 'tis an express sin against the <hi>Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is an Act of <hi>Injury</hi> and <hi>Vsurpation</hi> Offer'd to the <hi>Church</hi> in presuming to thrust themselves into a <hi>Sacred Office,</hi> which such men are not intrusted with, nor thought fit at all to Execute.</p>
            <p>For, Many may be able to <hi>discourse</hi> unto <hi>Men</hi> (since if they chance there to fail in point of <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> the matter is of less Consequence.) But the <hi>Church</hi> will trust but Few that shall <hi>Lead</hi> men when they speak to <hi>God,</hi> because there a <hi>Falshood</hi> may oft prove an <hi>Abomination</hi> in speech, and an <hi>Incongruity</hi> may soon amount to <hi>Blasphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would gladly Demand of any prudent Person, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he conceives that when the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51072:4"/>

Sad Experience tells us the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and informs us loudly enough of their <hi>Solaecisms</hi> and <hi>Blasphemies.</hi> And the same Experience tells us that the <hi>Directory</hi> helps them not at this Dead Lift: Nay it may often prove the greatest Impediment, since were some weak men allow'd to choose as well their <hi>matter</hi> as their <hi>words,</hi> they might perhaps come off with some tolerable approbation: But being forc't to Confine themselves to <hi>matter,</hi> which either they well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not, or are not so much used to speak on, their <hi>Prayers</hi> are oft times <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> or (which is worse) <hi>Erroneous</hi> or <hi>Blasphemous.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For, when <hi>Cartwright</hi> that <hi>Puritan Incendiary,</hi> saw he wanted Power either to <hi>Extirpate</hi> or <hi>Alter</hi> our
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51072:5"/>
               <hi>Establisht Book of Common-Prayer, He</hi> was the <hi>First</hi> durst boldly use this Forbidden <hi>Knell of Devotion,</hi> which he, and those who follow'd him, improv'd to so great an height by <hi>Posting over</hi> our <hi>Liturgy</hi> with so much <hi>Carelesness</hi> and <hi>Scorn,</hi> and by giving all the Advantages to those <hi>Forms of their own,</hi> [advantages] both of the <hi>Voice</hi> and of the <hi>Eyes</hi> and of the <hi>Hands</hi>; that the People began ere long to think, that the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> was but a <hi>Vseless Task</hi> impos'd by the <hi>Church</hi> on the Priests: But that they <hi>compleatly serv'd God</hi> if they came in [to the Church] when the Psalms were singing; because, besides that they <hi>praised God,</hi> and had the Benefit of a Sermon, they heard a <hi>long Prayer</hi> too [And that] set out with all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and all the Advantages it could possibly receive from the <hi>Art,</hi> or from the <hi>Natural</hi> good <hi>Parts</hi> of that Person who compos'd it. So that he who will needs continue the use of these <hi>Forbidden Prayers</hi> in the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit</hi> takes the readiest Course (as much as in him lies) for the rooting out of the <hi>Publick Liturgy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It may be said perhaps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that many <note n="*" place="margin">This is too true, but makes it not a whit more Lawful.</note> 
               <hi>Church-men</hi> both of great Knowledge, and great Place, have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves used these <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Praying.</hi> And upon that ground, why may not they?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Truly if to Argue at this rate were <hi>Concluding,</hi> it might soon free us not only from the tyes of many <hi>English Laws,</hi> but from the Obligation also of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> it self, which without all doubt is broken often enough, not only by those of the Common Sort, but by men of great Place and Knowledge. But we must <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi> between <hi>Consuetudo</hi> and <hi>Corruptela,</hi> and so Learn that <hi>Vsages</hi> taken up against express <hi>written Laws,</hi> are <hi>Corruptions,</hi> but not <hi>Iustifiable Customs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51072:5"/>I suppose that these men do not at all like the Course that the <hi>Independents</hi> now use in <hi>Prayer,</hi> who permit this <hi>Extemporary</hi> or <hi>Voluntary</hi> way not only to the <hi>Priests,</hi> but to their <hi>Souldiers</hi> and to their <hi>Mechanicks.</hi> And I Imagine a main cause of their mistakes to be, because such an <hi>office</hi> is <hi>intruded</hi> on by those men who have no just <hi>Authority</hi> to perform it. But then if they would consider things well, they would easily find that this use of <hi>Forbidden</hi> Prayer has <hi>Metamorphos'd</hi> them into <hi>Independents</hi> since they have no more <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to compose such <hi>Forms</hi> from the <hi>Apostolick Church</hi> that <hi>Ordain'd</hi> them, than either that person has, who is now employ'd to <hi>make shoes,</hi> or that other <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> whose Formalities are a <hi>Belt</hi> and a <hi>Buff Ierkin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One thing I shall add more, and it is a short Discourse how the <hi>Pulpit Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> were brought into the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We must know then, that in the times of <hi>Popery</hi> the manner Commonly was to use the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> or else an <hi>Ave Maria</hi> before Sermon: So that when King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Sixth</hi> came to Compose his <hi>Injunctions,</hi> He made Choice (as he had very good Reason of the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> for that purpose. But because it was thought fit that the Kings just <hi>Supremacy</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> things should be at least Weekly publisht to the People, it was thought Expedient to premise to the <hi>Pater-noster,</hi> a <hi>Form</hi> (as his <note n="†" place="margin">'Tis call'd there <hi>the Form of Bidding the Common-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> Sparrow's Collect. p. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Injunction</hi> styles it) of <hi>Bidding Prayer,</hi> wherein the <hi>Priest</hi> was not to <hi>speak</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> but only to the <hi>People, Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> them to pray Instantly for such and such Persons (and things) but He pray'd not to God at all, until he clos'd (his <hi>Exhortation</hi>) with the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi>

And yet when we do but <hi>exhort</hi> them <note n="*" place="margin">Or desire them.</note> to <hi>joyn</hi> their Prayers, such Clauses may not be unfit.</p>
            <p>I can scarce think of any other apparent way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them <note n="†" place="margin">From imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence in that practice.</note>.</p>
