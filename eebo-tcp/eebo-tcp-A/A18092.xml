            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsidering with my selfe (gentle reader) how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a disease the stone is, and how little helpe the parties grieued haue by the vsvall means of Physicians in this our time, and of long time haue had: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hearing it diuerse times obiected, that the most learned Physician can neither preuent the stone, in those, who naturallie are inclined thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, neither cure it in those in whom it is ingendered, I did endeuor my selfe with all studie and diligence, to find out somthing, which might far excell the remedies now dailie vsed for the cure of the stone.</p>
            <p>VVherevpon taking mine inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Etius,</hi> who vsed very much the powder of Goats bloud for cure of the same: also being further persuaded therevnto by authoritie of diuerse,
<pb facs="tcp:18934:3"/>
writing of the nature of goats bloud: I did with my great charge attempt to draw a pure and cleare liquor out of the bloud of the male goat, which with the patience of the Physicians, I will be bold to call a Quintessence.</p>
            <p>And hauing made experience ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of now two yeares, and better, with diuerse: I thought good to publish the same, to the reliefe of many, which are grieued with that disease, and that in such sort, as it shall appeare vnto the world, that I rather seeke herein to benefite my Countrie, than anie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate gaine to my selfe.</p>
            <p>For whereas no man troubled with that disease, can haue the helpe of the Physician, without his great charge: I haue deuised that meane, that anie man so diseased may haue such ease with verie small charge, as I dare boldlie auouch, cannot be had by anie vsuall meanes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18934:3"/>
But for the commendation hereof I leaue it rather to be commended by the helpe and ease of those, who feele the passions of that most terrible dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, than vse anie long Rhetoricall persuasions, knowing that good wine needs no garland, &amp; that the fairest garland can be no long credite to sowre wine.</p>
            <p>But for better performance of my promise, I thinke it verie necessarie, to signifie vnto such as are inclined to the stone, and to those that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie troubled with the same: First, <note place="margin">The diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foure Chapters.</note> the causes of the stone, and whereof it is ingendered. Secondlie, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of stones ingendered in mans bodie. Thirdlie, the vsuall way, both to preuent and cure the stone. And fourthlie, the way or meane now late deuised for preuenting and curing of the same. VVherin being somwhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, they shalbe the better able to
<pb facs="tcp:18934:4"/>
gouerne themselues, in auoiding and curing the disease, as not needing the Physicians continuall counsell, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Physicians to themselues.</p>
            <p>Yet I would not haue anie man think, that I mind to make any long or curious discourse of the stone, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching all the deepest pointes of the same, as endeuoring to make the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders perfect Physicians herein: but onelie to shewe them a superficiall knowledge, sufficient to direct them in the taking of my Quintessence, both for the preuenting and curing of the stone.</p>
            <p>And thus (gentle Reader) haue I diuided that, wherof I mind to write into foure partes, wherein I will not endeuor my selfe to speake whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer may conuenientlie be spoken: but rather to speake nothing that maie conuenientlie be left out.</p>

            <head>The causes of the stone, and <hi>how it is ingendered in</hi> mans bodie. <hi>The first Chapter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not vnknown vnto such as haue bestowed any time in the studie of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, that as well the old as new wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent do all agrée, that there are two causes of the stone: the one materiall, <note place="margin">Two causes of the stone.</note> the other formall. The materiall cause is an earthlie, grosse, thicke, and slimie humour: the formall cause is the heate of mans bodie, digesting or baking the said humour, vntill it be hard, which then remaineth in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a stone. This will I make more manifest vnto you by a familiar example.</p>
            <p>Claie of it selfe is an earthlie and slimie substance, which I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare vnto the humour whereof the
<pb facs="tcp:18934:6"/>
stone is ingendered. Also the fire I will compare vnto the heate of mans bodie, whereby you may sée how the stone is ingendered. For this claie being baked in the fire, is made a stone, and looseth his nature of claie.</p>
            <p>Here also I thinke it good to note, that nature requireth alwaies a fit matter to worke vpon. For one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie action of nature, at one time wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth diuerse and verie contrarie ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes: which happeneth, bicause of the contrarietie of the matters wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon she worketh, and not by anie diuersitie of hir action.</p>
            <p>For as by fire, claie is made a stone: so chalke being a stone, by fire is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into powder. And as claie by fire is made a fast and firme substance which before was soft, and easie to be dissolued in water: so chalke being before a fast and sound lumpe, is by the same fire made fit to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in water, because of the disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie, or separation of his parts.</p>
            <p>Whereby you may gather, that this
<pb facs="tcp:18934:6"/>
slimie humour, being in mans bodie, hath a nature verie apt to be turned into a stone, which otherwise, by so small heate could hardlie be. And therefore I would wish euerie man to haue a speciall care in refusing meats, and other things, which are apt to bréede the stone, and in vsing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, which hereafter in place conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, touching the preuenting of the stone, I will not omit.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue (according to my promise) brieflie spoken of the two causes of the stone.

            <p>As touching the first, there are two

vsuall places where the stone is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered, the kidnies, and the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Unto the stone of the kidnies, the middle aged, and they that somewhat decline, are most subiect. And these stones of the kidnies are also of two sorts. For they are either ingendered in the hollowe vessels of the kidnies: or in the substance or flechie parts.</p>
            <p>But vnto the stone of the bladder, children are most inclined: which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, for that all children (for the most part) first eate often, before that which they eate before be digested. Next after they haue eaten, they vse violent exercise, &amp; motion of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies continuallie, wherby they force a thicker &amp; more grosse iuice or nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the stomach into the body, than nature requireth: and that grosse substance settling in the bottome of the bladder, by the temperate heate of the childe, is conuerted into a stone. As in the making of the artificiall wines, if you let them passe through the strainer gentlie, of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
<pb facs="tcp:18934:7"/>
they come cleare: but if hastilie you force them by wringing, they come thicke, and being settled, will be full of grounds in the bottome.</p>
            <p>Secondlie for colour, there are some stones white, some blacke, others yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, some red, some ash colour, and some mixt of diuerse colours. Which diuersitie happeneth chieflie by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the matter wherof the stones were ingendered: and somewhat by digestion of the stones, either by smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or greater heat, with either longer or shorter time.</p>
            <p>The third difference of stones, is in forme or fashion. For some are round, as a ball: some like an egge, some like a pease, some like a barlie corne: some sharpe, some piked, and of diuerse and sundrie other formes, whereof I néede not speake.</p>
            <p>The fourth difference is in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie. For the stone differeth in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, from the bignesse of a pins head, or lesse, vnto the quantitie of an egge, or greater. And the smaller sort of
<pb facs="tcp:18934:8"/>
stones, are (for the most part) ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the kidnies, and that either in the hollowe vessels of the kidnies, as I said before: which being but small, the stone cannot excéed the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, and therefore must bée small also. Or else in the substance or fleshie parts of the kidnies, here and there dispersed, which also are neuer found to be great. But the greater sort of stones are alwaies ingendered in the bladder, for that the vessell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, will also admit the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a great stone.</p>
            <p>The fift difference is in hardnesse. For there are some (as I haue often séene) which are scant congealed or baked, so that one may breake them to grit with his finger &amp; his thumbe. Others somewhat harder, and not easie to be broken. And others so hard as they will not easilie yéeld to the Hammer. The stone that breaketh gentlie, is (for the most part) red or yellowe. The middle sort is of diuerse colours. The hardest, white.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the two former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I haue brieflie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the matter, whereof the stone is ingendered, and the difference of stones. Now I will shewe the vsuall meanes, both to preuent and cure the stone, which (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Physicians of our time) are now dailie practised.</p>
            <p>The stone in those, who onelie feare the disease, and are not yet troubled therewith, is preuented by two speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes. The one is, by abstinence from meates, &amp; things which are apt to bréede the stone. Which are of two sortes also. For either they bréede in the bodie a fit matter, easie to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into a stone: as Ueale, Pigge, Lambe, Ling, Gréenefish, Eeles, Chéese, Milke: and generallie, all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie grosse, slimie, swéete, &amp; fat meates. Or else they cause an vnnaturall heat
<pb facs="tcp:18934:9"/>
in the bodie, and inflame the kidnies, and other parts: as, heating the backe at the fire, lieng much vpon the back, also great vse of Pepper, Ginger, and other spices, or anie thing of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>The other by purging that humor, which being in the bodie, is not as yet digested to the nature of a stone: which is done by two meanes also. Either by purgations, and laxatiue medicines: or otherwise, by those things, which being of a verie subtile, thin, and pearsing nature, passe sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie through the liuer, the kidnies, and the bladder, and violentlie carrie with them, such stimie and grosse hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as they find by the way: as, white wine, and Rhenish wine, &amp; such like taken fasting: which being not taken fasting, worke not this effect. For being vsed either with, or soone after meat, they hasten the digestion, &amp; carrie grosse and rawe humours into the bodie, whereby they worke a verie contrarie effect, and ingender the
<pb facs="tcp:18934:9"/>
stone being much vsed.</p>
            <p>But the stone being alreadie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered by the vsuall meanes, is to be cured chiefly by things, which cause the stone to breake and void: as Saxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, Parslie, Pellitorie of the wall, Gromwell, and other things infinite, whereof I haue named foure good, pleasant, &amp; easiest to be taken. There are also diuerse other meanes: as let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting bloud, purging, glisters, vomits, and mollifieng or distending the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe and streight vessels with oiles, &amp;c. wherein the stone sticketh. But for breuitie sake, all these I let passe.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Haue hitherto briefly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the causes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stone, the difference of stones, and the vsuall meanes for preuenting and curing of the stone.
<pb facs="tcp:18934:10"/>
Now I mind to shewe the waie, both to preuent and cure the stone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of Goates bloud. But the maner of making this <hi>Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> the choice of the Goat, the time of the yeare, the diuersitie of the bloud of the arterie, and of the veine, and the order of distilling, and circulating the same: also, the preparation of the Béere in which it must be taken, I will not here speake of: but will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it in writing, to the right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull and most learned companie of Physicians in London: wishing them to appoint certaine Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which shall be sworne for the iust &amp; true making of this <hi>Quintessence:</hi> which being so made, the Physicians may direct the same to be giuen, as to them (their patients, and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rightlie weied) shall soeme most méete.</p>
            <p>But in the meane time you shall haue of this <hi>Quintessence</hi> (although no great quantitie, yet so much as shall be sufficient for the triall of the
<pb facs="tcp:18934:10"/>
same with a great number, and of the Beere prepared, in which it must bée taken) at <hi>Maister Graies</hi> house the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecarie <note place="margin">The place where the <hi>Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> is to be had.</note> in Fanchurch streate: whose honestie and good dealing I dare boldlie commend vnto you. The order of vsing this <hi>Quintessence,</hi> is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take euerie morning fasting halfe a wine pint of the Beere prepared, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">How this <hi>Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> is to be vsed.</note> 
               <hi>which the Apothecarie shall adde a quantitie appointed of the Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because the diuersitie of patients will make a diuersitie of the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Béere, &amp; that the elder sort are able to take more, and the yonger lesse, let this be a generall rule.</p>
            <p>Euerie one take a verie good and heartie draught, according to the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the person, in the morning, and fast one houre after it. And if he be not as yet vexed with the stone, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to vse this twentie daies in the Spring, and twentie daies in the fall of the leafe: which will preserue him
<pb facs="tcp:18934:11"/>
from the disease. But if he be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the stone, let him vse it as long as he findeth any grauell to void: which is a certain rule to know when he is cured.</p>
            <p>Also he must vse no violent motion of his bodie, but gentle walking, or such like, whiles he taketh it: least the stone beginning to breake, the péeces thereof fall into the narrowe vessels, betwéene the kidnies and the bladder: or from the bladder into the yeard, to the great torment of the Patient.</p>
            <p>You shall haue this halfe pint, with the <hi>Quintessence</hi> therein, sufficient for one quantitie for foure pence: which I haue thought good to set down certaine, that euery man might knowe the same: and considering the charge in buieng the Goates, and kée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them, also in making the <hi>Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essence,</hi> I thinke euerie man may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie satisfie himselfe the benefite to be verie small.</p>
            <p>And now to end this my short worke, I let passe that which a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:18934:11"/>
of writers set forth of the nature of the Goat, &amp; the vertue of his bloud against the stone. Onelie I alledge one sentence of <hi>Fuchsius,</hi> an excellent, wise, and learned Physician, which I find in his booke <hi>De medendis morbis.</hi> Writing of the stone, &amp; the cure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, after he had shewed diuerse reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, he endeth thus: <hi>Sanguis denique hircinus, ad calculos cùm renum, tùm vesicae praesens remedium est. Nam praeexistentes soluit, &amp; per vrinam excernit, &amp; vt alii amplius non generentur prohibet, ac dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem sedat. And to conclude, Goates bloud is a present remedie, both for the stone of the kidnies and the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For it dissolueth those that are there alreadie, and voideth them by vrine, and suffreth no more to ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, also taketh away the paine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I thinke it good to note, that if anie person dwelling farre from London, would take of this <hi>Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> &amp; cannot haue the Béere fresh carried, in which it ought to be taken, let him buie at <hi>Maister Graies</hi> of the
<pb facs="tcp:18934:12"/>
               <hi>Quintessence,</hi> which he shall haue for fiue shillings the wine pint: and when he will vse it, boile halfe an handfull of Parslie in strong Ale, half an houre or lesse: and into one hartie draught thereof, adde two spoonefuls of the <hi>Quintessence;</hi> and drinke it in the Morning fasting, and fast one houre after it, at the least. Use this order twentie daies togither.</p>
            <p>The cause whie I wish the Pars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to be vsed is, for that it is a great opener, and will helpe the <hi>Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> to passe more swiftlie to the kidnies &amp; the bladder, where it ought to worke, which otherwise continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long in the stomach, would not worke so effectuallie.</p>
            <p>But least this most excellent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine should perhaps be standered: as also, if any person whatsoeuer desireth to haue conference with me for his greater ease, not finding (perchance by some abuse) such remedie as I haue promised, and he looked for: let him (if it seeme good) repaire to my
<pb facs="tcp:18934:12"/>
house in great Wickam in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Buckingham, where he shall find the Authour, without either pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or pennie worth, readie to do what possiblie he may, for his further cure. And if by taking ought, herein hée breake his promise, let him be thought rather a deceiuer, than one séeking the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
