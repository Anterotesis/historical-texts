         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

this, that Conſcience of duty in any particular action is to be ruled by that
law which is proper to that action; as for example: The <hi>Chriſtian law</hi> is the
rule of Conſcience for Chriſtian actions; the <hi>law of reaſon,</hi> or morall ſaw,
for morall; the <hi>law nationall,</hi> municipall, or locall, for civill; the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
law of all creatures,</hi> for naturall actions; and the <hi>law of ſcandall,</hi>
(a branch of the Chriſtian law) for matters of ſcandall; and the <hi>law of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
for indifferent free actions. And as it is very irregular, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to meaſure any action by a rule that belongs not to it, to try the
exactneſſe of the circle by the ſquare, which would be done by the compaſſe,
and in like manner to judge the Chriſtianneſſe of an action, by the law of
naturall reaſon, which can onely be judged by its conformity with the law of
Chriſt, ſuperiour to that of nature; So will there be no juſt pretence of
conſcience againſt any thing, but where ſome one or more of theſe lawes are
producible againſt it; but on the other ſide, even in the loweſt ſort of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

to make any action lawfull, which is not regulated by thoſe rules, or

in the world, for them that can ſwallow ſuch Camell-ſins as theſe without any
regrets, nay with full approbation, and direction (perhaps) of conſcience
(it that may be called <hi>Conſcience</hi> which is ſo divided from, and contrary to
<hi>knowledge</hi>) yet to ſcruple and interpoſe doubts moſt tremblingly, and moſt
conſcientiouſly in matters of indifferency; not ſo much as pretended to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the word of God, (and ſo within the law of chriſtian liberty, that they
may be done if he will) and yet over and above their naturall indifferency
commanded by that authority, in ſubjection to which the chriſtian vertue of
obedience conſiſts; and all this either firſt upon no ground of conſcience at
all, but only that it is contrary to their <hi>Phanſy,</hi> their <hi>Humour,</hi> their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions;</hi>
or Secondly becauſe it is a reſtraint, upon their chriſtian liberty,
which yet Chriſt never forbid to be reſtrained <hi>quoad exercitium, as farre as
belongs to the exerciſe of it,</hi> but hath permitted ſometime the care of not <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the weak brother, i. e.</hi> Charity, and ſometime Obedience, to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſuperiours, to reſtreine it, (for if in things indifferent they may not
reſtreine, there can no obedience be payed to them;) or Thirdly becauſe they
are offenſive (though not to them, yet) to others, who are perſwaded they
are unlawfull. Whereas I that perſwaſion of thoſe others is erroneous, and
not ſufficient to juſtifie diſobedience in themſelves, much leſſe in other men,
in caſe of lawfull humane command, And 2 that their cenſuring of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
actions, <hi>i. e.</hi> being <hi>angry without a cauſe,</hi> may bee greater
matter of ſcandall, and ſo more offenſive to others, and more probable to
work upon them to bring them by that example to be ſo argry alſo, then the
doing that indifferent action, miſtaken by others, and condemned for unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
would be to bring them to tranſcribe that reprobated ſamplar, <hi>i. e.</hi> to
doe what they thus condemne; all men being farre more apt and inclinable
to break out into paſſions, then into acts againſt conſcience, and ſo more
likely to be ſcandalized or offended, or inſnared, by following the former,
then the latter example, to ſinne (for company or after another man) by
cenſuring whom he cenſures, which is being angry without a cauſe; then by
doing what they are adviſed and reſolved they ought not to do, which is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
againſt conſcience. Or fourthly, becauſe they are againſt their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to doe, whilſt yet they produce no law of God or man againſt them,
and ſo in effect confeſſe there is nothing in them againſt conſcience; unleſſe,
as before was noted, they wilfully aequivocate in the word <hi>Conſcience;</hi> which
will and skill of theirs, as it will not make any thing, unlawfull, which
before was indifferent, ſo will it not conclude ought, ſave only this, that
they which are ſo artificious to impoſe on others, and forme ſcruples
where there were none, would not be thought the likelieſt men to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

ſome lighter leſſe important matters (if it may be ſuppoſed excuſable, as a
weakneſſe of an uninſtructed mind, joyned with that good ſymptome of

way of commutation or expiation for groſſer ſinnes, ſo that he that falls
foulely in any confeſſed ſinne, ſhould fare the better at the great day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
or be in leſſe danger of being caſt out of Gods favour for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
becauſe he is over-ſcrupulous in other things: For ſure this were a
ſtrange way of ſupererogation to pay one arreare to God by running into
another with him, to diſcharge a debt by owing more. And yet this is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
which may ſeem worth the paines of preventing, it being ſo notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeen, that ſome men, which profeſſe to have care of their wayes, and
muſt in charity be beleeved to have ſo, goe on confidently in greivous ſins,
which they cannot but know will damne without repentance, (the ſentence of
not inheriting the Kingdome of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. being ſo diſtinct, and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and abſolute, and indiſpenſable againſt them) and yet have no Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
to relye on for the averting that danger, but onely this of their exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſcrupulouſneſſe in things indifferent; which if they ſhall ſay they
doe not confide in, they are then obliged, in conſcience, and charity to their
brethren (who may follow them to this precipice) either to give over ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
or to ſet to purifying, without which there is no true ground of hope.

will briefly be ſtated by premiſing what before was mentioned, that the good

that particular action be both for matter and circumſtance regulated by the

admonition able to ſhake them out of all impenitence, by telling them the
danger which attended, if the only laſt method of working on them which

that time or ſpace, there is no doubt, but that act, firſt, is contrary to
good conſcience, and contracts a guilt, and conſequent to that, the diſpleaſure
of God and obligation to puniſhment, which nothing but repentance can
do away; yea and ſecondly, is a naturall means of weakning that habit of
good, of ſauciating and wounding the ſoule, and for that time putting it in

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>50</label> That this matter may be throughly cleared, I ſhall ſuppoſe this objection
made againſt what hath hitherto been ſaid of it, that it may ſeem by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
[that the regenerate man may bee under Gods diſpleaſure] that hee
that remaines ſanctified may be unjuſtified, for ſo he will be, if all his ſinnes
be not forgiven him, which they are not, if this act of ſinne not yet repented
of, be not forgiven. In anſwer to this, I ſhall reinforce my affirmation, that
of neceſſity it muſt be granted, if we believe the Scripture, that any ſuch act
of ſinne unretracted by repentance, doth certainly ſtand upon the ſinners
ſcore unremitted; for that God (as ſome affirme) doth at the firſt act of
my being juſtified, forgive all my ſinnes not only paſt, preſent, but alſo
future too; cannot be ſaid, but upon a ſuppoſition that that man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
commit any ſuch ſinne againſt which the Goſpell threatens periſhing,
<hi>i. e.</hi> any deliberate preſumptuous ſinne, (which ſuppoſition if it were true,
would inferre an impoſſibility of the regenerate mans thus ſinning, not an
aſſurance of his pardon without (or abſtracted from the consideration of)
his repentance, which is the only point, in hand) for if he doe, then upon
confeſſion and forſaking there is promiſe of mercy, and not otherwiſe; and
in briefe, without repentance there is no remiſſion: and therefore it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable,
that they which thus affirm, find themſelves enforced to fly to
Gods omnipotence and immensity, to whom all things are preſent; by help
of which they can conceive and reſolve that at the time of that sinnes being
upon him unrepented of, God yet ſeeing his future repentance as preſent,
may ſcale his pardon, and then may by the ſame reaſon do ſo alſo before
the commiſſion; the weakneſſe of which arguing, I ſhall no farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42068:12"/>
then by this rejoynder, that by the ſame reaſon it might be ſaid,
that a man is juſtified before he is borne, which yet the objectors doe not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,
but that at the time of his firſt converſion, be it at ſuch a Sermon or
the like, he was juſtified, and then all his ſins paſt, preſent, and to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
him, which is as contrary to the notion of all things being preſent with
God, as to ſay that this act of commiſſion is not forgiven till it be repented
of, for ſure the time before that mans birth, and the time after it, are as truly
preſent to God before all eternity, as the time of this commiſſion and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

were no longer ſecret) not the way of Gods immenſity, (which if it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
by us, were not immenſity) but the way of his revealed will, which
is, that whenſoever the ſinner <hi>repenteth</hi> him of his ſinne, and <hi>amends</hi> his life,
he ſhall have his ſin <hi>blotted out</hi> and <hi>put out of Gods remembrance, i. e.</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
unto him and not till then: and to ſuppoſe he may have remiſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch repentance, is to ſuppoſe God perjured who ſweares he ſhall not,
and to lay falſity to the charge of the whole Goſpel, which reſolves, <hi>Except

            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>52</label> To all this I might farther adde that Gods juſtifying the faithfull man,
is the approving his fidelity upon tryall of it, and ſo acquitting him (upon a
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or probation) from ſuſpicion of hypocriſie, pronouncing him faithful,
or Evangelically righteous, and upon that, owning him as a friend, entring
into League with him, as might appeare by Gods <hi>juſtifying Abraham and
calling him friend</hi> (in the ſenſe wherein they are Chriſts <hi>friends, which doe
whatſoever be commands them,</hi> ſo approve themſelves unto him) if it were
now ſeaſonable to examine that buſineſſe. This being ſuppoſed, it would be
moſt evident, that ſuch an act of knowne deliberate ſinne committed in time
of tryall, is quite contrary to <hi>juſtification,</hi> even as contrary as <hi>Abrahams</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to beleeve Gods promiſe firſt, or after to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac,</hi> you may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
would have been. Of which the leaſt that can be ſaid, will be this, that
ſuch a failing is a ſhrewd blemiſh to ſincerity, which will make it neceſſary
for him that is guilty of it, to repaire his credit with God by expreſſing a great
ſence of his miſcarriage, and by many future performances of conſtancy, and
reſolution, if ever he hope to be approved, or <hi>juſtified by him.</hi>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>53</label> But now having thus far confirmed this, and ſo rather ſtrengthned, then
weakned the objection, the next thing I ſhall deſire may be obſerved is this,
that every non-remiſſion of a ſinne for ſome time, every diſpleaſure of Gods,
every not-imputing to righteouſneſſe, is not an utter interciſion of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is not a calling all the former forgotten ſinnes to remembrance, for to
ſuch onely an Apoſtacy, or continued falling away from God betrayes the
ſoule. For, the whole current of my life may approve my fidelity to God,
though ſome one action be very contrary to it: Nay ſecondly, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be diſpleaſed with his Sonne for ſome one fault, and yet
not difinherit him, nay upon farther provocation he may caſt him out
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42068:12"/>
of his family, and yet afterward receive him into it againe.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>54</label> So that there are three degrees obſervable in this matter, firſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
ſecondly wrath, thirdly fury. Firſt withdrawing of the Fathers favour,
ſuſpenſion of pardon, ſo tis in caſe of any ſuch ſingle act of ſinne preſently
repented of, conſidered before its retractation. Second, caſting out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
totall interciſion of mercy for that preſent, ſo tis in caſe of ſuch ſin per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in indulgently. Third, utter finall irreverſible abdication, ſo tis in caſe
of finall obduration.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>55</label> This may be illuſtrated, 1. by a vulgar, then by an eccleſiaſticall reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance.
Among friends 1. there may be a matter of quarrell, diſlike, diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and one friend juſtly frowne upon the other, yea and keep ſome diſtance
from him, and be really angry with him, for ſome act of injury done by him,
contrary to the lawes of friendſhip, which till he hath ſome way repaired, the
friend may juſtly not pardon him, and ſo abſteine for that preſent from the
former degree of familiarity with him: but then 2. the injurious friend may
continue as injurious ſtill, and go on and perſiſt in that courſe of falſeneſſe
or unfriendlineſſe, and then the injur'd friend wholly forſakes his company,
breaks off thoſe bands of friendſhip with him, yet ſo as that upon the others
relenting and amending, he may yet againe returne to him, and ſo that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
ſeparation prove no finall one, 3. there is, upon obduration or no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of relenting, a finall irreverſible breach.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>56</label> The eccleſiaſticall reſemblance is, that of the three degrees of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
among the Jewes, the firſt or loweſt, was <hi>niddui</hi> ſeparation, not totall
turning out of either ſacred or civill ſociety, but remotion to a diſtance, that
the offender ſhould not come within foure Cubits of any other, and ſo be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
the peace of the Church, and the familiar kind of communion, which
others enjoy. Above this there was <hi>cherem</hi> which was a totall excluſion or
diſtermination with anathemas or execrations joyned with it, but yet was
not finall, then thirdly there was <hi>Schammatha</hi> giving up to deſtruction
or deſolation, delivering up to Gods comming in judgement, and that was
irreverſible.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>57</label> Now for the full ſatisfying of the argument, (having already ſhewed you
the ſtate of this offender in reſpect of juſtification) it will onely be neceſſary
to adde one thing more, that the ſtate of the ſame man as it reſpects ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
is parallel and fully proportionable to the ſtate as it reſpecteth juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and ſo the objection will quite fall to the ground.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>58</label> To the clearing of which you muſt know that ſanctification may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in a double notion: 1. as a gift of Gods, 2. as a duty of mans. To
prevent miſtake, this I meane, God gives the grace of converſion and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
and he that is effectually wrought on by that grace, is converted
and ſanctified, this is it which I meane, by the firſt notion of ſanctification,
as it is a gift of Gods: But the man thus converted and ſanctified, <hi>i. e.</hi> thus
wrought on and effectually changed by the Spirit of God, is bound by the
Goſpl-law, to operate according to this principle, to uſe this talent, and this
is called, <hi>to have grace, Heb. 12. 28. i. e.</hi> to make uſe of it to the purpoſe there

makes uſe of the talent intruſted to him, operates accordingly, doth what
that enables him to doe, offends not againſt it by idleneſſe, or by commiſſion
of contrary ſinnes, which he that doth, is the <hi>non habens, he that hath not</hi>
there, from <hi>which ſhall be taken away,</hi> &amp;c. And this having of grace is it
which I meane by the ſecond notion of ſanctification, as it is a duty of mans,
which I conceive is meant by the Apoſtle, when he ſaith, this <hi>is the will of
God, even your Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>he which hath this hope purifies himſelf,</hi>
and <hi>let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſes perfecting holineſſe,</hi> all which
places ſuppoſe the thing ſpoken of, to be the <hi>duty</hi> of man, which by the help

every ſuch act of deliberate commiſſion as we now ſpeak of, is contrary
to ſanctification in this latter notion, contrary to the <hi>duty</hi> of the ſanctified
man, from which breach of duty it was, that we bound him before under that
guilt, which nothing but repentance could rid him of, and if you mark it,
that is the onely thing which contracts a guile, the doing ſomewhat contrary
to <hi>duty,</hi> and ſo the want of this ſecond notion of Sanctification it is, the want
of ſanctified operations, which interpoſes any rubs in the buſineſſe of our
juſtification, and not ſo properly that wherein God onely was concerned, his
not giving <hi>grace,</hi> guilt being ſtill a reſult from ſinne, and ſinne being a
<hi>breach of the law,</hi> a contrariety to duty and not to guilt; and though he
that hath not received the gift of ſanctification be not juſtified, yet the cauſe
of his non-juſtification then, is not, in proper ſpeaking, Gods not having
given him grace to ſanctifie, (for that is but a negative thing, and cannot
produce non-juſtification, which is in effect a poſitive thing by interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſignifying condemnation, two negatives making an affirmative, non-juſtifying
being non-remitting of ſinne, and that the actuall imputing of it

ſo are there alſo in this of ſanctification, the firſt, <hi>grieving the Spirit of
God, Eph.</hi> 4. 30. reſiſting it, traſhing of God in his courſe of grace and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
towards us, putting our ſelves under <hi>niddui,</hi> as it were, in reſpect of Gods
grace, as well as his favour, and ſo weakning our ſtock of ſanctity, and
this the deliberate act of ſinne may be thought to doe. The ſecond, is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42068:13"/>
               <hi>quenching of the Spirit, 1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 19. putting it quite out, <hi>rebelling and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
