            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

MONARCHY No creature of Gods making, &amp;c.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:54357:9"/>
not in Law as it is in Religion; It was great wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to put downe and extirpate the Hierarchy before any order or government was agreed upon, but if there were ten grievances for one in the Law, it would be leſſe miſchievous to Continue them all then to have no Law at all, for should the force of the Law be ſuſpended but one day ſcarce a man living but hath ſome enemy or other that would deſtroy him in body or estate in that time; Nor is it lawfull for any Iudge but onely for the ſupreme authority to remove a ſtone which is ill placed in the building; Lawes that are made by publique conſent are not to be judged or cenſured by any but the Law makers, becauſe by them all judgement is made; as Iuſtice (which is to doe reaſon to every man) is the end of the Law ſo the Law muſt be the rule of that Iuſtice; a Iudge must not judge of Lawes, but according to Lawes, and no man must be wiſer then the Law, are excellent maximes, the Law is the hedge of every State, and he that breaks downe the hedge shall be bitten with Serpents: I conſeſſe it would be most honorable for the Reverend Iudges and learned practiſers of the Law to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an expedient to that good effect, and to doe it ſo effectually as to challenge all rationall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to finde out a better; Men that travaile a Road daily can the beſt tell every deep and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſtep in it, it is no ſuch hard matter to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve where and how honest cauſes many times miſcary and dye for want of formall and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proceedings occaſioned through the want of

old shadowes and Legall ceremonies of the Iewes did diſappeare and vanish at the coming of the ſubstance, but wee know that there was much ſtrugling to maintaine them, and the Apostles did not abſolutely condemne ſuch as were zealous for their old practiſes, they thought it better to temporize a little, and to give the Ceremonies a decent funerall gradually as the people were able to leave it rather then to ſtruggle too much and deſtroy all that are contrary minded, and <hi>Pauls</hi> councell in the <hi>15.</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> is full of divine wiſedome, that where God hath put no difference betweene Chriſtians, but purified their hearts by faith they should not oppreſse one another through difference of opinions, though it was about a great ordinance (a Scripture that should make many Christians ashamed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to joyne &amp; walke with ſuch in Chriſtian ſocieties that are not in every thing alike minded with them) all honest Patriots and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the Commonwealth are not happily of the ſame judgement about the Reformation of the Lawes and ſetling the courſe of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, yet are not therefore to differ in affection, but being intent upon the popular utillity, and therein all agreeing, there is much prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, not to diſoblige honest men ſo to reforme for the publique good as not to deſtroy private Relations, the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friars</hi> had a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon the diſſolutions of Monaſteries, and God forbid that any man that hath an office or imployment which is not evill in it ſelfe but by

               <hi>18. 26.</hi> but the part of a Iudge is more difficult in ſome reſpects ſpecially in point of time. A Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter hath a weeke happily for his Sermon, and ſeldome any diſeaſe ſo violent, but the Phyſician may conſult about it; but where many people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Iuſtice at an Aſsiſes, there is not onely a promptitude of elocution, but much ſcience requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to give quicke diſpatch, which is the Clyents joy, and Iudgement is ſomething more then ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Be inſtructed ye Iudges of the earth! but be<note place="margin">Erudimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</note> conſciencious for learning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a good Conſcience are two of the bravest ſupports in the world; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man cannot be deprived of the firſt in this world, nor of the other in the world to come, and Iudges are ſo far to be skild in the Law of God, that in all cauſes coming before them they are to warne the Clyents that they treſpaſſe not againſt the Lord, <hi>2 Chron. 19. 10.</hi> If this learning should fall (which I hope I shall never live to ſee) then farewell to Ministers, and after that, no more Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Prudence; <hi>10</hi> anſwer all objections and cavillations that will be brought to put life into a dead Cauſe; for in most great ſuites the parties Litigant commonly thinke that they are both in the right, and if the matter be heard by no wiſer men then themſelves, how shall he that is in the wrong ever come to ſee his Error? and this Prudence in a Iudge conſiſts principally in giving ſatisfaction to the hearers, that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is Iuſt, and if poſsible to ſatisfy him againſt whom Iudgement is given, that he hath no wrong done him.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, There is required Mercy; after Iudgement, the poore mans condition is to be conſidered, for, if Iuſtice be wound up a peg too high in the Execution of it, it breaks <hi>Summa Iuſticia</hi> is the degeneration of it.</p>
            <p>But by this learning I am far from underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Craft or Artificiall ſubtillities in taking legall exceptions for the quashing of Inditements and thereby to ſave a witch or a murderer from the Gallowes, or to arest the Iudgement when the money is conſcionably due to the Plaintiffe, this is none of that wiſedom which <hi>Solomon</hi> deſired, <hi>I Kings 3. 9.</hi> which is requiſite in a Iudge; it is a wiſe and understanding heart to diſcerne Iudgement betweene good and bad, truth and falshood, a righteous and just cauſe, from that which onely is ſo in appearance the ſimplicity of the Dove in doeing wrong to no man, and the wiſedom of the Serpent, to ſee that by ſubtillitie in pleadings, unneceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, captious interpretations, and clamorous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, an honeſt cauſe be not delayed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or overthrowne; marke I beſeech you, what a Iudge Prince <hi>Iob</hi> was <hi>Chap. 29. 11.</hi> when the eare heard me, then it bleſſed me, and when the eye
<pb facs="tcp:54357:14"/>
ſaw me, it gave witnes to me, hearers had not words enough to praiſe my eloquence, hee was ſo admired, that any one but <hi>Iob</hi> would have been proud of halfe ſo many acclamations. <hi>Ver. 12, 13, 14.</hi> Becauſe I delivered the poore that cryed, and the fatherleſſe, and him that had none to help him; the bleſſing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I cauſed the widowes heart to ſing for joy. I put on righteouſnes and it clothed me, my Iudgement was as a robe &amp; a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme, the poore oppreſsed ones gave him <hi>10000.</hi> benedictions, the widow owed to his care, the conſervation of her children; and by banishing ſadnes from her looks he made her life comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and her mouth publisht his praiſe; the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, being vertuouſly educated, were in a better condition, then when they had a father; though Kings adorne themſelves with purple, yet they minde their pleaſurs and honors more then doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iustice to the friendleſse; but <hi>Iobs</hi> principle ornament and garment, Crowne, and Diademe, was Iustice. I was eyes to the blinde, and feet was I to the lame, I was a father to the poore, and the cauſe which I knew not, I ſearched out, hee mixed the quallitie of a father with that of a Iudge, granting executions against poore men with a bleeding heart; melting to thinke that ſuch as are lame, and blinde, should be ordered to run, and ſee like thoſe who are to lye in priſon for one hundred pound when they are not worth twenty pounds; certainly the moſt honorable title is to be ſtiled a father of the poore (for what need
<pb facs="tcp:54357:15"/>
is there of rich men, but onely to doe good to the poore?) and though a ludge must not pitie the poore in Iudgement, yet after Iudgement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced there is place for mercy, which is but Iuſtice; and before ſentence the poore mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ought to be ſo deere &amp; precious to the Iudge as not to pronounce any ſentence againſt him till his cauſe be throughly not onely opened, but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when the poore had none or but little Councell, <hi>Iob</hi> was as well their Advocate as their Iudge; As by the wiſedome of the Law of <hi>England</hi> the Iudge is to be a Councell for the priſoner in matter of life and death, ſo was Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice <hi>Iob</hi> a Councell for poore men in all Civill Cauſes; and would not let any man lye in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for a debt untill he had examined the justnes of it, and that it was cleerely due as well in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as by Law, and his juſtice is moſt conſpicuous. <hi>Iob 31. 13.</hi> If I did deſpiſe the cauſe of my man ſervant or of my maid ſervant, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with mee; hee heard the complaint of his ſlaves, he permitted every man to ſpeake for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before he be hayled to priſon, to alledge rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why hee ought not to be carryed thither, and the ground of ſuch his ſupereminent Iustice was <hi>ver. 14. 15.</hi> VVhat then shall I doe when God riſeth up, and when he viſiteth, what shall I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer him? did not he that made me in the wombe, make him? and did not one fashion us in the wombe? that though he was a Iudge upon earth, yet he was a ſervant to the God of heaven; who would enter into judgement with him, that
<pb facs="tcp:54357:15"/>
though the condition of the Iudge, and the Client be different, yet their birth is alike, God is Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them both, the Clients body molded of dirt, and the Iudges not formed of any nobler matter, and that both of them had the honor of being formed by the hand of God, and both their ſoules made after his Image, as if Iudge <hi>Iob</hi> and his ſlaves were Copartners or Tenants in Common; that Princely ſpirit goes on, and from <hi>ver. 16.</hi> to <hi>ver. 25.</hi> makes the moſt incomparable chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge that ever the people heard of; If I have withheld the poore from their deſire, or have cauſed the eyes of the widow to faile; Or have eaten my morſell alone, and the fatherleſse hath not eaten thereof: (for from my youth hee was brought up with me, as with a father; and I have guided her from my mothers wombe.) If I have ſeene any perish for want of cloathing, or any poore without covering; if his loynes have not bleſſed me, and if hee were not warmed with the fleece of my Sheep; if I have lift up my hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the fatherleſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when I ſaw my help in the gate; then let mine Arme fall from my shoulder-blade and mine arme be broken from the bone; for deſtruction from God was a terror to me, and by reaſon of his highnes I could not endure; if I have made gold my hope, or have ſaid to the fine gold, thou art my confidence; if I rejoyced becauſe my wealth was great, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe mine hand had gotten much; if I rejoyced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up my ſelfe when evill found him. The ſtranger
<pb facs="tcp:54357:16"/>
did not lodge in the ſtreet, but I opened my dores to the traveller. If I uſed to keep guard at my ſtudy-doore that ſuitors could not ſpeake with me without a fee; if I ſent a man back with a shamefull deniall; if I did not miniſter ſpeedy juſtice to the poore for the love of Iuſtice; and to the rich for a ſmall matter; when I ſate in the City-gate where the Court of Iuſtice were kept that every man might ſee and heare the reaſons of my proceedings, if I were not as tender of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Petitioners as if we had tumbled in one belly together, and ſuckt the ſame milke; if I have not uſed my power to tame the inſolence of proud ſpirits, making them examples by death or other penalties, where their wicked lives had given ſcandales, if the wooll of my flocke hath not defended the poore from the ſtormes and rigor of winter; if I have ill treated the Orphants and let one brother feaſt &amp; brave it, and the younger children to be all beggars, or be fed at the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the elder brother; if I have confidence in the merit of the perſon &amp; not in the justice of the Cauſe; if I have more eſteeme of birth then ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and preferred greatnes before pietie; I then wish that that guiltie part may be torne from my body and that to terrifie all Iudges that abuſe their power; then let my arme be broken from the bone by the infamous hangman; for Mariners are not in ſo much feare of the Tempeſt in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as I ſtand in awe of the anger of the great Iudge. If mine enemies miſerie have been any pleaſure to me; if I have thought my ſelfe better

then my neighbours, becauſe I was richer, if I were ever overcome by threats, or corrupted by preſents, to pervert Iudgement; if my conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was ever shaken by any bribe; or if ever mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had more power over my minde then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; if I were ever cruell to any man and made dice of his bones; though the men of my taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſaid <hi>ver. 3.</hi> Oh that we had of his flesh, we cannot be ſatisfied; I had ſervants and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers enough, not onely to have hurried any man to priſon to have repaired my honor, or contented my paſsion, but ſuch as alſo would have cut them in peeces, and devoured them; if I have not helpe every man to his Lands that had right to them without drawing teares from their eyes by tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attendances, then I am content not only, that heaven should curſe my lands (that for wheat which I shall ſow I may reap but thiſtles) but to be tormented with an eternity of miſeries!

<pb facs="tcp:54357:19"/>
I crave leave to anſwer, first, as to the adminiſtration of Civill Iuſtice in this Province, thus it ſtands; my Lord Lieutenant (the dayes of whoſe life, the Lord of life multiply and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the further Terror of his Enemies: and greater comfort of his deere ſervants) upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny petitions from the Inhabitants of the Province of <hi>Munſter</hi> was pleaſed to revive the Preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie Court there as formerly; conſisting of the Lord Preſident, two Gownemen, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a first and ſecond Iustice, and other Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>My Lord Deputie (who is a bleſsed Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and indefatigable in the works of holines and righteouſnes) for the great eaſe and ſafety of the people, hath altered the Provinciall Court into County Courts, that whereas before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple travailed fourty or fifty miles, now their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences are ended at home in the nature of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes or ſittings; And the Honorable Commiſsion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Parliament promoting the true liberties and freedome of the people, have given great eaſe to them in taking away ſome needleſſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and in matter of Fees, there being ſeldome twenty shillings ſpent in a cauſe by all parties, unleſſe it be in Councells Fees, which are aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and but very ſmall in compariſon; I doe not in the twenty shillings include the charge of witneſſes which yet is very ſmall, not goeing out of their owne County; but the Fees uſuall which are allowed to the officers, Iury, Clarks, and Attorneys (for the Court hath not any) every man pleading his owne Cauſe, which I obſerve
<pb facs="tcp:54357:20"/>
to be a good way for diſcovering the truth; The forme and method of proceedings hath not by me been altered in any point conſiderable; but indeed the originall conſtitution of the Court ſeeme to me to be excellent in foure particulars.</p>
            <p>The firſt proces of the Churt hath ever been a ſummons in the nature of a <hi>Subpena,</hi> then an attatchement or diſtreſse of the defendants goods, not reſtraining his perſon but for matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or upon very juſt and reaſonable cauſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is a mixt Court, and the Bill may containe both Law and equitie whereby halfe the ſuites in the Province are ended or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, but hath no Cognizance of Pleas reall concerning titles of Land.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Cauſe is heard and ended as ſoone as it is ripe for hearing; indeed herein is ſome alteration, for whereas formerly there were but two or three ſittings in a yeare; the Iustices and practizers attending the upper Courts at <hi>Dublin,</hi> in the Terme-time, and ſo cauſes depended long; Now (having no other buſines to doe) wee end the difference as ſoone as it is prepared for a hearing, which ſome (how Iuſtly let wiſe men Iudge) have cenſured to be an inovation and precipitous Iuſtice; indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy is the Stepmother of Iuſtice, and must as carefully be avoided as falling from a Rocke, but that is to heare and determine before both parties are ready or had convenient time ſo to be; otherwiſe when a Cauſe is ripe for ſentence why should not the Court put in the Sickle? a ſpeedy
<pb facs="tcp:54357:20"/>
tryall is the Plaintiffs joy and just Iudgement delayed may prove worſe then an unrighteous ſentence ſpeedily pronounced.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is a great difference between the proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> and the ancient courſe of this Court in point of payment of debts; for debts are payd by instalment as the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants are able to pay them (a most excellent and admirable compoſition of a Court) for the caſe of poore <hi>Ireland</hi> ſtands thus; the poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> who through Gods mercy ſaved their lives, but lost their estates by the Rebells; begin now (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) to returne to their poſſeſsions, and the protected <hi>Iriſh</hi> make a hard shift to live, paying great Contributions; and many a poore man hath got a plough of five or ſix garrons, as many cowes, forty or fifty sheep, all worth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifty pound; this poore man payes for horne and corne, and begins to grow warme in his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, but comes an Action of debt (like an armed man) upon him, for fifty or a hundred pound, contracted before, or for his neceſſarie ſubſistance during the Rebellion; the Plaintiffe having been long out of his money, is very ſtomack-full (blame him not after ſo long faſting) and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes with all rigor; Iudgement cannot be denyed him; an execution againſt goods in other Courts Iſsues of Courſe, and what followes? the goods are ſold at under rates, at <hi>25.</hi> or <hi>30.</hi> l'. (for who will buy his neighbours goods ſo taken from him but will be ſure of a good penny-worth?) and the fees and charges of the execution are ſo
<pb facs="tcp:54357:21"/>
great, that the debt if it were but <hi>50.</hi> P. is not halfe payd, and for the remainder, the defendant is taken in execution where he ſtarves to death, and his wife and poore children beggs from doore to doore, unleſſe relieved by the parish; but by the courſe of this Court the defendant comes in, and prayes an Instalement and a Iury of indifferent and impartiall neighbours inſtall the debt to be payd by ſeverall gales and dayes of payment, as in the Defendant shall be thought able, and if the Iury (who certainely are the proper Iudges in ſuch caſes, for it may be their own caſes the next day) findes any fraude, deceit, or violence, the Defendant is impriſoned, as he well deſerves, by which meanes (it is an obſervation to me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry admirable) though the people be extremely indigent, there not being ſcarce a tenth part of the money here that is in <hi>England,</hi> debts are I believe ten times better paid here then in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for of <hi>5.</hi> or <hi>600</hi> l'debts that have been here ſued, for in ſome one Countie ſcarce know ten of them but are payd, or ſecured, whereas if the Reynes of the Law had beene let looſe here, as in other Courts in all probability, there had never been ten debts of a hundred ſatisfieed; for not one Defendant in twenty hath ſo much money by him, and if either his perſon be restrained, or his little flocke taken away, his friends leave him, and ſo miſerie quickly findes him; but give him time, he works like a mole to keepe himſelfe or his goods from Arreſt; one friend like one hand helps another; he recovers ſome other debts due
<pb facs="tcp:54357:21"/>
to him, and in a short ſpace becomes a noune ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive; I could inſtance in many that had A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions against them of <hi>2.</hi> or <hi>3000</hi> l'. value (it would pitie a man to ſee more load ſtill layd on, as if they would be prest to death; yet by this way of Inſtalment, the man having a breathing time agrees firſt with one, then with another, and in a short ſpace growes into as good credit, as any of his neighbours, the contrary practize of not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaling debts, as men are able to pay, hath beene the ruine of many families that might have flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished to this day; and by this meanes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution to the Army is payd, Agriculture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with many families) would all be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruined if the Farmers should be unſtocked by ſuch executions. The practiſe of this Court hath likewiſe formerly been very profitable and eaſie to the people in matter of Executorships, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, as to end ten or twenty ſuites upon one bill filed againſt an executor, or adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the creditors are all called, and every mans part proportioned according to the conſcionable demerit of the debt, and not the whole eſtate ſwept away upon a dormant Iudgement, to the defrauding of many poore Creditors, with ſome other equitable practiſes too long for an Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond cenſure that many preach uncalled, or that have other buſineſſe to doe, wee know that untill there was a ſtanding office of Prieſthood, <hi>Moſes</hi> who was the chiefe Iudge of all Civill Controverſies exerciſed, the Prieſtly office, <hi>Pſal. 99. 6.

<pb facs="tcp:54357:23"/>
after their being declared Traytors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which reſolutions were printed with their names thereunto, which was not denied ſcarce by any of them; my Lord Lieutenant, looking upon it ſomething like the generall caſe in <hi>Adam,</hi> that man who was the maſter peece of the creation was wholly loſt, was pleaſed to referre the ſaid Clergies Petition to <hi>Sir William Fenton, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell Phaier,</hi> and my ſelfe, to proceed againſt them in like manner as the Honorable Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> proceed against ſcandalous Delinquents, or inſufficieut Miniſters; which we did accordingly and (in his Excellencies abſence) attended my Lord Deputies pleaſure therein, who joyned <hi>Eſquire Gookin, Dr. Harding, Colonell Hodder,</hi> and <hi>Capt.

&amp; faithfulnes to the Parliaments juſt authority, being like ſo many poore sheep, ruled by thoſe whom they call their ſpirituall Sheepheards; yet becanſe many of them might be drawne thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for their own preſervations (as the caſe then ſtood with them) and upon the matter forced to ſubſcribe rather to ſave their livings then out of any diſaffection to the proceedings of Parliament; ſuch of them as did acquit themſelves from ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall in life and doctrine, and were gifted for the Miniſterie are continued, and enjoy their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices without diminution, unleſſe it be in caſe of pluralities: and truly for my owne part, I found much Ingennitie in many of them; and wherein they differ from us, I take it to be from a conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious principle; &amp; hope &amp; daily pray that there may be a right understanding and better agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between all honest and conſciencious people that feare the Lord, that we may all as one man with one shoulder, labour to exalt the Kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to advance holines &amp; rigbte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes in our ſeverall Actions; but indeed, the harveſt is like to be very great in this Nation, and the laborers in Christ Vineyard are very few, many poore <hi>Engliſh</hi> here are like corne, ready to be brought into Gods Barne by Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but there are very few painfull, skilfull, harveſt-men, pray we therefore the Lord of the Vineyard, that hee will ſend forth Laborers unto his Vineyard, or as the words are, caſt them out, for men are very ſlow in ſo holy a worke, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that have the tongue of the Learned, that

<pb facs="tcp:54357:25"/>
candle hee waſted his vitalls, to give light to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſeldome thinking it time to eat till he had done the worke of the day at nine or ten at night, and then will ſit up as long as any man had bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines with him; indeed he was every thing from a foot Souldier to a Generall; and thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done whilst any thing was undone; his laſt tedious and wet march into <hi>Conaught,</hi> for the reducing of <hi>Clare,</hi> and other Caſtles, after the rendition of <hi>Lymericke</hi> cost him deere (as I underſtand) occaſioning the fever; his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father would not ſuffer him to dye by the hand of the enemy, nor of the Peſtilence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his deere ſervants have beene called home; he was a moſt exact Iusticiarie in all matters of morall righteouſnes, and with ſtrength of ſollid reaſon had a moſt piercing Iudgement, and a large understanding heart to diſcerne betweene good and evill, truth and error; hee was one of thoſe good Magiſtrates propheſied of in <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> and his converſation was a true interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Text, being ſo intent to Gods honor, that he never thought himſelf ſerved or be friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any Action unles God was therein, ſerved and honored; let us minde our duty (ſayes hee) and what Scripture have you to warrant it? I believe few men knew more of the Art of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy and ſelfe intereſſed prudentialls, but never man ſo little practized them; he is, and shall be moſt deere to my remembrance; and of all the Saints that ever I knew, I deſire to make him my Preſident; for uprightednes, ſinglehearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb facs="tcp:54357:25"/>
and ſincerity; he exerciſed it to his enemies; Oh, ſayes he, deale platnely with them, let them know what they muſt truſt too, and though hee was very ſparing in his promiſes to the Rebells, yet he was moſt liberall in performances; he had a very cleere divine light of truthes ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and being ſtrong in faith and of a most humble and meeke ſpirit, gave God the glory of all ſucceſse; upon the leaſt loſse we received by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or any diſappointment; Oh, ſayes he, is not our God angry with us? let us be fervent in prayer to know his minde in every checke or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement; as upon the loſſe in attempting the Iſland by <hi>Lymericke,</hi> where gallant Major <hi>Walker</hi> lost his life; He wrote to Colonell <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and others of us here, by the name of his Christian friends and brethren, to be earnest with the Lord, to know his minde what he would have his poore ſervants in the Army to doe; I doe verily thinke, that ſince the Apoſtles dayes there was never more Divine breathing of the Spirit of Chriſt in any Letter then in that; He had a moſt noble propertie, that if any man was queſtioned or cenſured behind his backe, he would be his Counſell, and argue for him every thing that could be rationally alledged; never did man in the owning of his Authority more diſowne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; hee was a most exemplary Christian in duties of piety and Religion, alwayes beginning and ending Conferences &amp; Councells with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſeeking wiſedom, adviſe and ſtrength from God upon all occaſions, he had conſtantly (when
<pb facs="tcp:54357:26"/>
in Gariſon) an exerciſe before ſupper, and though he ſatt in Councell till eight or nine at night, yet by his good will the diſcourſe should not be the shorter, but when <hi>Mr. Pacient</hi> (a man of great experience in heavenly things) or any other, ſeemed to be ſtrained in time, he would ſay, let us not thinke that time too long in Gods immediate ſervice, and when others had ſpoken to any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable and uſefull question, hee would ſpeake with that depth of Iudgement ever tending to unity and unanimity in opinions and affections, that (to my ſlender apprehenſions) I doe not know that ever I heard him maintaine any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and was willing to heare truth from the Souldier; when the ſicknes encreaſed the last yeare, he appointed not onely one or two dayes to ſeeke the Lord to revoke that Comiſsion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fourth day of the weeke for ſix weeks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſure it is a bleſſed thing when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Magiſtrate to all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be ſervent in prayer, when wrath is gone out from the Lord and the Plague begin <hi>Num.</hi> the <hi>16. 46.</hi> his eſtimat or character of a godly man, was not principally that he was of ſuch a ſorme, opinion, judgement, or attainement; but where he found the maine bent and reſolution of his ſcule to be to know God in the face of Ieſus Christ, and to promote his glory, to ſerve the Saints, to begin or ſecond a good motion, with all his might; to doe good to every viſible object, to love the first appearances and cherish the least ſparks of grace, and Image of Chriſt in whom ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb facs="tcp:54357:26"/>
exiſting and to renounce the honors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and pleaſures of this life for Chriſts ſake who became of no reputation for us; he greatly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Communion of Saints, and made union with Chriſt (and not any other opinion) the ground of it, which is the onely foundation of that Church, againſt which the gates of hell shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevaile, as that ſweet ſpirited Chriſtian <hi>Mr. Ieſſe</hi> hath unanſwerably evinced; he would often ſay to this effect, that there was no honor like to the ſervice of Ieſus Chriſt, and let our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition be who shall be moſt inſtrumentall for God in his generation, and having done our worke with all diligence, let us truſt God for our wages, but halfe worke is not pleaſing to God. I know the want of ſome diſtinguishing ordinances was a burden to him, and I am afraid that our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father hath a controverſie with many of us in <hi>Ireland</hi> for ſeverall deficiencies or redundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as first, our undervallueing the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, I am afraid ſometimes that God will make the leſſe account of our bloods and of our children, becauſe we ſo little eſteeme (if not trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-foot) the blood of his Son in that Ordinance; if a Chriſtian cannot conveniently enjoy it, yet he should mourne for the want of it. Secondly, for not Sanctifying the Lords Day, the morallity whereof too many deny, and ſuch as hold it, yet upon every triviall and ſlight buſines, which might have been done the day before, or deferred till the day after; forget to keep it holy; I agree that works of neceſsity and mercy may be done
<pb facs="tcp:54357:27"/>
upon that day where it is really ſo of Gods ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for publique utillity; but a culpable neceſsity of our owne making will not excuſe the breach of that holy Law. Thirdly, that when the honest interest is ſtrugling for life ſome should be ſtriving for eſtates or rather when Ieſus Chriſt is daily Crucified in his members by the bloody <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> there should be emulations and contentions amongſt us for ſuperiority, or prudencie, as was amongst the Apoſtles; that whereas <hi>S. Paul</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commands to render honor to whom honor is due, <hi>Rom. 13. 7.</hi> wee are too ready to aſſume titles of honor which are not owned in <hi>England.</hi> Fourthly, or it may be that every officer hath not the bowells and tender care of a father to his poore companions, <hi>1 Chron. 11. 17. 18. 19.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> longed and ſaid, Oh that one would give me drinke of the water of the well of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> that is at the gate. And the <hi>3.</hi> brake through the hoſt of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> and drew water out of the well of <hi>Bethlem</hi> that was by the gate, and tooke it and brought it to <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> would not drinke of it but powred it out to the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaid, my God forbid it me, that I should doe this thing; shall I drinke the blood of theſe men that have put their lives in Ieopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it, therefore he would not drinke it. Fiftly, or per adventure that we are not ſo intent upon the principle worke that wee were ſent over about <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz</hi> to right and reſtore the plundered, banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and oppreſſed <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Sixtly or lastly, that
<pb facs="tcp:54357:27"/>
we doe not put a difference between ſuch as have been active in the beginning or proſecution of the Rebellion, and ſuch as have only had their hearts, and not their hands in it; the Lord help us, wee know not how to caſt a ſevere eye upon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and yet a pitifull eye upon the perſon, ſome are too indulgent in the remiſſion of juſt punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; others turne Iudgement into wormewood by an over exact ſeverity; but bleſſed be God, what errors are amongſt us? they are but in the head, I hope our hearts are ſound and right for Holines, Iuſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Mercy; ſpecially ſuch as are intrusted in Councell and Conduct; this is but as an humble Caution. And whether it pleaſed God to take away ſo precius an Inſtrument; either for his owne ſins, or for ours (we being indeed not worthy of him) or that his glory may be made more manifest, that he is not tyed to any man, but can carry on his owne worke, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of the wiſeſt Counſellors, and moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant worthyes; It is not for us poſitively to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
            <p>Pray pardon me but a word more, truly all things conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I doe not know, that there are diverſities of gifts and operations, but it is the ſame God and Spirit which worketh all in all, <hi>1.

and deſirable, both as a man and as a Chriſtian, I thinke it will be hard with many candles to finde his equall; but he that made him ſo good lives for ever, and his yeeres change not, <hi>Pſal, 102. 27.</hi> who can (and I truſt will) richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne and quallifie his ſucceſſors, and make them ſuch as he would have them to be; that what his <hi>Moſeſſes</hi> shall leave undone, may be finisht by his <hi>Ioſhuaes;</hi> which will undoubtedly be ſo, if our unbeliefe hinder not good things from us; for bleſſed be God they which are next in Command here, and many others, are of Gods deſignation Called and faithfull and Choſen, and ſuch as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor God; and therefore ought to be honored; but Tragedies muſt not be long, thoſe that knew him not may thinke I ſpeake for affection, and thoſe that were intimate with him will blame me of ignorance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I ſay ſo little, the more worthy he was, the greater is the loſſe, eſpecially to his deere and honored relations, (whom the Lord bleſse with all benedictions, temporall and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall) for whoſe ſakes I should not have ſaid any thing in point of Comendation least it should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their ſorrow, but that I hope that they are, and shall pray that they may be more poſſeſsed of that rare Iewell of Chriſtian reſignation and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the divine will; I am ſure that hee was tender of the honor and wellfare of the Sonne of God and his members: therfore no doubt but God will be a Father to his good Lady and Children, but great griefes command ſilence, and it is beſt to caſt a vayle upon it, that wee ſorrow not even

as others which have no hope, and now (moſt Honorable) becauſe God will honor them that honor him; It is but my duty to beare testimony to all thoſe excellent things which you have done for the glory of God and good of the Nations; It was ſaid of <hi>Hercules,</hi> that no man deſerved ſo much as he, becauſe hee freed the world from Lions, VVolves, and Tygers; you that may truly ſay with <hi>David;</hi> we have killed the Lion and the Beare, shall I trust be bleſſed and aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to curbe and overcome the <hi>Goliahs</hi> that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe righteouſnes and holines, the <hi>Phyliſtins,</hi> deceivers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and myſticall wolves; all oppreſſors, and cruell men, all ſuch as are inwardly ravening wolves in point of ſelfe-intereſt, building their fortunes upon the ruines of honeſt men, though they appeare in any sheeps clothing; ſo shall your names be famous, and immortall; which yet is not to be interpreted ſo much a comendations of the perſons, as the gifts and Graces of God in them. And ſo with all ſubmiſſe gratitude to Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, that wee Your faithfull ſervants here, live in Your remembrances, as knowing it to be all the intereſt expected; therein reſembling (like deere Children) Your Heavenly Father, who finding a thankfull heart, for one mercy conferrs another; I shall turne my prayſes of you into prayers for you and yours, that God would make you maſters over the peoples hearts and mindes, as well as over their bodyes, that you may be a burdenſome ſtone to all oppreſsion, to breake in peeces all petty Tyrants; and to conquer not only
<pb facs="tcp:54357:29"/>
the Eccleſiasticall beast, but the Politicall; that if it be his will you may live to rayſe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructures, and finish the building of that foundation which you have ſo happily layd and begun; And that after long lives, for the glory of God, and the good of the Nations, you may follow that truly worthy member that is gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, into that bliſſefull inheritance of the Saints in light, where is all day and no night, where your daily cares and troubles shall ceaſe; and the voyce of the oppreſsor shall not be heard; ſo prayes</p>

            <p>It ſeems to me, that the holy Spirit in expreſſing thoſe three grand prerogatives that the Kings of the Gentiles would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto; had an eye to the preſent age wherein wee live; and therefore many booke learned Royaliſts not being able to anſwer this Scripture, have declared their Iudgements to be (whether their hearts and pens were of the ſame minde Ilargue not) that the Lord did allow of

               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Yes doubtleſſe, there are as evident promiſes for the Churches of Chriſt in this age of the world to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed out of Antichriſtian bondage by the <hi>Moſeſes, Ioſuas, Sampſons, Gideons, Iep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thahs,</hi> and <hi>Samuels,</hi> which the Lord ſhall raiſe up to be inſtruments in his hand to ſave his people; as there were in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ioſuas</hi> ages, that the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be delivered from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and reaſon to me cleerely makes it out; that if a promiſe of an earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> were a ground of the Churches Warre much more their ſpirituall liberties; that if I may defend my houſe by force from theeves and robbers, certainly I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my ſelfe in the exerciſe of my ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall liberties, which are ten thouſand times deerer to me: if I may fight for a peece of glaſſe, may I not engage for a precious pearle that is invalluable?

which no King can plead againſt Gods people in the matter of their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall priviledges; God will have the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the world know, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Civill right they may pretend to their Kingdomes where they have by force or flattery gained the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as the honeſt man parts with his purſe to ſave his life; yet they muſt not upon paine of forfeiting their Royalties perſecute his friends and ſervants: Kings that ſtile themſelves, <hi>Defenders of the Faith,</hi> if they prove offendors of the faithfull; God will take away their Kingdomes in a way of Iuſtice, and righteouſnes, when any of the 10.

it, and He that is Truth when men are lyars, is alſo wiſe when they are fooles; for the oath was only binding to the poſitique capacity, to be true to the King, ſo farr as he was true to the Lawes and ſafety of the people: Hee that tooke it in any other ſenſe made the King a God, infallible and impeccable when he ſets up a ſtandard of defiance againſt them, is any man ſo unſound in his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectualls as to thinke that the oath obliges him to ſtand ſtill, and ſuffer his owne throat to be cut; No oath can tye any man to doe or ſuffer that which is deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to humanity, and as for Chriſtians certainely by that ſtatute of <hi>Numb.</hi> 30. what ever any Chriſtian vowes without the conſent of her husband Ieſus Chriſt is meerely voyd in Law, and a precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate raſh oath, as that of <hi>David</hi> againſt <hi>Nabal,</hi> I <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 22. binds not but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <hi>Levit.</hi> 5. 4. 5.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54357:50"/>
put <hi>England</hi> into a ſalvable condition for doe but conſider how ſeverely the Lord dealt with <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> when their Princes turned Lions and Wolves: Then the Lord gave them a King in his anger, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 7. and <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13. 11. <hi>ver.</hi> I gave them a King in mine anger, and tooke him away in my wrath; will any man ſay that <hi>Sauls</hi> office of being King was of Divine ordination which was done in anger, all Gods ordinances are appointed in love for the good of his people and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane ſociety, but <hi>Sauls</hi> being made King diſpleaſed the Lord; and it is very remarkable that on the day, and at the very houre of election, <hi>Samuel</hi> dealt juſtly with them, and told them of their great evill in rejecting God and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, 17, 18, 19. and <hi>Samuel</hi> called the people together unto the Lord to <hi>Mizpeh,</hi> and ſaid unto the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thus ſaith the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I brought up <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered you out of the hand of the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and out of the hand of all Kingdoms, and of them that oppreſſed you, and yee have this day rejected your God who himſelfe ſaved you out of all your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and tribulations, and yee have ſaid unto him, Nay, but ſet a King over us; but though the Kingly Government
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54357:51"/>
diſpleaſe God, yet obſerve how gently <hi>Saul</hi> behaved himſelfe to the people, 1 <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> 11. 12. There were ſome that would not have <hi>Saul</hi> raigne over them which the people would have had put to death, but <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 13. There ſhall not be a man put to death this day; whereas the Monarchs of the world make men offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for a word, one man for ſpeaking in jeſt, that he will make his ſonne heire of the Crowne, meaning a houſe that had that ſigne in <hi>Cheape-ſide;</hi> and another for ſaying, there goes <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. in <hi>Coleman-ſtreet</hi> have been moſt Tirannically murdered and executed, <hi>Saul</hi> was never ſo bloody minded.</p>
            <p>But one paſſage I may not omit, the Holy Ghoſt (foreſeeing that Monarchy would have many Advocates to plead for its divine right) for the ſatisfaction of all that will not wilfully ſhut out the light, calls this importunitie of the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> to have a King to be a great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſuch a ſin that the Lord will not let goe unpuniſhed, but ſent unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weather, thunder and raine in wheat harveſt, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 26. 1. As ſnow in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and as raine in harveſt, ſo honor is not ſeemely for a foole, I hope <hi>England</hi> will not forget the wet ſeaſon in ſummer 1648. how it was mid-winter at mid-ſummer,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54357:51"/>
and certainely the works of God have a voice and are moſt eloquent to his owne people; what the Lord did to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for their asking a King, <hi>England</hi> hath great cauſe to thinke that the Lord was highly diſpleaſed with thoſe that would have made peace with the late King, read but 1 <hi>Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 12. from the 16. to the 22. and it is all one to ſay, that God is the Author of Monarchy, as that he is the Author of ſin; for the bleſſed ſpirit (which cannot lye) calls it a great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, the people call it their evill, and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſayes they have done all this wickednes; yet feare not, for the Lord will not forſake his people; for his great names ſake, becauſe it hath pleaſed the Lord to make you his people, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to pray for them <hi>ver.</hi> 23. as if Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was ſuch a great ſin that if it had not beene, that the Lord will not truly deſtroy his owne people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 33. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 12.

of Heaven to governe the world by rationall men as hee enlightens it by the ſun; for Reaſon is the ſoule of all things ſublunary, and the life of all Iuſt human lawes without exception, by this reaſon no man in the world ought to challenge a power unaccomptable over others; for the people are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly the originall of all Iuſt power, then any King ever was, of a Conſtables authority: And ought to be accountable by the ſame reaſon for offences againſt the Publique good, as a Conſtable for his offence, but it is not the name of a King but the boundleſſe power which I argue againſt (though the Romans for the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of <hi>Tarquin</hi> would not endure the name) if any people ſhall place the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power in Parliamentary authority and give unto one man the Title of King for their better correſpondency with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Kingdomes, with no more power to hurt the people, then the Duke of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> or the Duke of <hi>Genoa</hi> have; ſuch a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment may be Iuſt and Rationall, but Domination is a ſweet morſell, let all States take heed how any man growes too popular &amp; engroſſes too much power into his hands.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I agree that Annointing does ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally imply that God accepts of ſuch perſons and things that are ſo annointed by his command; but obſerve, that God and the people were of a contrary minde in that Action; God appointed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed <hi>Saul</hi> as a Captain to goe before them to defend them from the Tyranny of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 15. 16. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 47.

But the poore <hi>Gibeonits</hi> caſe before wee leave it, affords us an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent document how Gods <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ought to carry themſelves towards <hi>Iſmaelits</hi> and <hi>Canaanits,</hi> that would have deſtroyed them, <hi>viz.</hi> to be very ſparing in promiſes and protection towards them, but have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once conditionated with them and received them into favour, to be very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall in performances towards them, and not to violate faith given in a title, though the conditions were obtained by craft and deception; And now I humbly intreat you to obſerve what little eſteeme <hi>David</hi> had of <hi>Sauls</hi> Royall ſeed to hang up ſeven of them; for what offence does not appeare, but very probable that they had given <hi>Saul</hi> bad councell to deſtroy the poore <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> and yet <hi>David</hi> had ſworne to <hi>Saul</hi> not to cut off his ſeed after him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 20. 21.

doe in the name of the Lord, Challenge all the Royaliſts in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to anſwer them if they can, or reſt ſatisfied with Scripture and reaſon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no oath of Allegiance or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy can be any ground to any people not to doe Iuſtice upon a King for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods owne heart (that never offended but in the matter of <hi>Vriah)</hi> therefore did not erre in delivering up <hi>Sauls</hi> ſeven ſons to execution; would not make his oath to <hi>Paul</hi> a ground not to doe Iuſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Spirit of God in <hi>David</hi> argued thus, I am by the Law of Nature as I am a creature, a poore worme bound to the holy and juſt Law of my Creator (which is unchangeable and undiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; God can no more diſpenſe with my loving and obeying of him, then hee can ceaſe to be God by reaſon of his Infinite goodnes) which Law is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that blood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires blood, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 9. 6.

And alſo for the Innocent blood that he ſhed, (for hee filled <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with Innocent blood) which the Lord would not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. And therefore when I take an oath of Allegeance or Supremacy, it muſt be ſaving that faith which I owe unto my Creator; as in Iuſtice <hi>Littletons caſe</hi> when any man did Fealty to his Lord, it was with a ſaving that faith and dutie which he owed unto the King, and thoſe other Lords which he held land of, by Priority of Tenure, which if it were not expreſſed it is implyed in Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

of Array and warrants from <hi>Saul</hi> to raiſe forces to ſecure the Countrey, and under pretence of keeping the peace to plunder and deſtroy whom they pleaſed, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what a glorious ſight it was in the eyes of heaven, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 14. when thoſe ſeven ſons were executed, God was intreated for the Land: It may be the common Law would have acquitted thoſe ſeven gentlemen, becauſe regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the principall is dead, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory cannot be tryed, but the Law of God makes all principall in murder whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſent or abſent, as the Law of man makes all principall in the higheſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Treaſon, and the loweſt offences of treſpaſſe; nor did <hi>David</hi> queſtion, what? ſhall I ſhed the blood of the ſeed Royall for the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> who were ſtrangers and bondmen, hewers of wood, and drawers of water, upon which Eternall Law of Righteouſnes, <hi>Major Ottoway</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Grant,</hi> were ſhot to death for murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Irish-man</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>VVaterford</hi> who having leave to goe into <hi>VVaterford</hi> to receive ſome money and to returne, was at his coming backe murdered by their Orders or Command, for which by the Councell of Warre they were juſtly condemned, and the execution was a moſt famous peece of juſtice, for had not zeale

and love to Iuſtice preponderated, and out-voted all private affections much might have been ſaid for the vallor, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and hopefulnes of the Major, and Cornet; I could not in faithfulnes but mention it as being a caſe ſo parallell to that 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.

            <p>But before we leave <hi>David,</hi> let me but obſerve how the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> for <hi>Davids</hi> one ſin of numbring the people; what had the poore ſheep done that 70000. men from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beersheba</hi> ſhould dye by the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in three dayes? Did not God thinke you therein reckon with them for their Kingly goverment, you will have a King ſaith the Lord to them, whether I will or no; you ſhall now ſmart for your wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes; for your great wickednes, for unmanning your ſelves, making your ſelves leſſe then men, to make one man equall with God, to doe what he pleaſes;

I will not endure it in my owne people; <hi>Eli</hi> ſinned, yet the people not puniſht, for he governed the people according to the minde of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but you will have a King, ſayes the Lord, as the Heathens have, be it ſo, but if he ſin Ile puniſh you, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the famine, but by a great peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and as you like that, ſo continue your Kingly goverment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But <hi>Davids</hi> dayes drew to an end therefore he gives a charge to <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſon, of righteouſnes, ſaying, there ſhall not faile thee a man on the Throne of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 4. which expreſſing a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Davids</hi> Throne: ſome may argue, that God approved Kingly goverment.</p>
            <p>As alſo there is another objection that ſhould have had priority in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 14. to 20. That God gave a Law for chuſing a King, therefore he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that government; the anſwer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is eaſie, that the Lord foreſeeing, that when he had brought them into <hi>Canaan</hi> they would deſire a King, like the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, being a people deere unto him, he would not therefore caſt them off; but tells them how to make the beſt of a bad bargaine, that if they will play with the Lion or the Beare let them plucke out his teeth; all Kings are ravenous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in point of their office, but ſome will

And why ſo? certainly, becauſe the government was unjuſt and tirannicall in it ſelfe, and therefore if the people who in their choice of a King have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed God, when they have well ſmarted for their folly, have wit to caſt him off, the Scripture ſayes, it is from the Lord, God does not ſay as in the caſe of Election they have rejected and caſt off me, not a word of anger or diſpleaſure, which holds forth this divine truth to all that will not willfully ſhut their eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light, that if the people in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, Perſia, Ruſſia,</hi> or any place in the world where one man governes, or pretends to rule as he pleaſes, will riſe againſt him and dethrone him, it is an action not only juſtifiable, but commendable, and if the King cauſe any of them to be put to death as Traitors, it is murder in him, and he fights againſt God, Iuſtice, and Reaſon, but it is otherwiſe where the goverment is juſt and rationall by godly righteous Magiſtrates and Iudges choſen by the people, if they be affronted and injured it is an offence, and high treaſon againſt the Majeſtie of heaven, they have not

will not have his people come under a Kingly Goverment, and that hee will plague them for their Kings offences; if they ſuffer it, there needs no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt Monarchy but a Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition; why was the Manna ſweet at one time and at another corrupt? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was Gods Ordinance for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſanctifying of the Sabboth.
