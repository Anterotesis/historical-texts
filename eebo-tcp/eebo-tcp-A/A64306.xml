            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TAXES, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>SINCE it is of the last Consequence to
every true English-man, that the present
War should be carried on for the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Liberties and Religion, against
the Common Enemy of both; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the false and foolish Insinuations of
some Discontented Jacobites, That a Peace with
<hi>France</hi> were more necessary than a War; and that
it is more carried on for the sake of others, than
our selves; and that if it were necessary, it might
be better carried on by our selves alone, than in
Conjunction with Confederates; and that the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way to secure our Religion and Liberty, obtain
a safe and secure Peace, and avoid the great Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
we are subject to for the carrying on the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100024:3"/>
War, were to cast off the Present Government,
and take Measures with King <hi>James,</hi> and the King
of <hi>France;</hi> yet there is nothing more clear than
that these Notions are altogether absurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable;
and that the true meaning of it is,
only to give up all that is dear to us, into the
Hands of two Princes, who have always preferr'd
the design of Subverting our Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to all other Considerations whatsoever; and
that it is much better to Fight for <hi>Flanders</hi> than
for <hi>England,</hi> and in Conjunction with Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
than alone, is what will bear no Dispute.
All that admits of a doubt is, What are the best
means and methods to carry on this War. As to
the first, relating only to the raising of Aids suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for this Undertaking, I thought I could not
do a more acceptable Service to my Country,
than at this time to contribute my poor Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
As to the latter, relating to the Military
Designs, and manner of executing them, I must
acknowledge my self wholly incompetent both by
my Education and Experience; and shall chuse
therefore to recommend that matter, with my good
Wishes, to those whose Province it is, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to my Soveraign; who I judge must needs be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
informed in this matter than any other Prince or
Person whatsoever.</p>
            <p>The Method I shall pursue to set this matter in
a clear Light, shall be to lay down some General
Rules or Maxims by which our Ancestors have
steer'd in the laying of Impositions, which had great
regard to the Constitution of the Government, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100024:3"/>
Condition of the People, and therefore are not easily
to be departed from.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I shall endavour to examine
the several Taxes that are now in use, and such
Foreign Taxes and Projects as are most in Vogue,
and by some thought to be more eligible to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd,
especially that of a Home-Excise, and
shew how far they are consistent or inconsistent with
the Government, Ease, and Liberty of the People;
and in the last place upon the whole, offer my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
what are the best Methods and Expedients to
raise Money by.</p>
            <p>As to the matter of those Aids, our Ancestors have
observed these Rules.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They must not consist of things of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Necessity or Livelihood, but rather Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They must not burthen our Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
and Manufactures, Materials, or other
things relating thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They have always avoided to impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
things wherein the People had no Benefit or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
but rather upon Land, Trade, and other
gainful Professions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rot. Parliam. 9 <hi>Edw. 3d.</hi> nu. 5.</note> They have always avoided New and
Foreign Taxes; and when propos'd, have declared
they could not grant them without advising with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100024:4"/>
those that sent them;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Co. Instit. 4 Parl. fol. 34.</note> and several Rebellions have
happened on this occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They have had always great regard to
the Condition of the several Ranks of Men among us,
to support them in the Condition they are in, and
consequently to preserve the Monarchy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> To charge Money and Personal Estate
not employed in Trade, double to Land and
Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Above all, That Equality should be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the Imposition.</p>
            <p>As to the Persons, these Rules were observed:
<hi>First,</hi> The dignified Clergy usually gave double to
the Laity, considering that they were freed from
all personal Services, and most other Taxes; that
their Revenues were all upon old Rents not subject
to Defalcations, Repairs, or Loss by Tenants, or
for want of them, or other Diminution; and had
great Advantages in point of Fines by Renewal.
And as for the other Clergy, their Tythes, and
other Profits, came into their hands with little
Charge, and that as well the Dignified, as others,
were provided for by Laws, not to come in by
Purchase but Free-gift, and are now exempted
from all Foreign Payments to <hi>Rome,</hi> and its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance,
to which all Foreign Popish Clergy are
subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100024:4"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the greater and lesser Nobility,
they were always treated Favourably, being the
chief Basis and support of the Monarchy, and were
allowed for their Port and necessary Support of their
Dignities, and did rarely exceed in the Payment of
their Subsidy, the Sum of 20 <hi>l.</hi> for 1000 <hi>l.</hi> which
they called a Spareable Part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the Rich Usurer or Tradesman,
whose Family and Expence was small, and Gains
great, and escaped most Burthens, as not being so
visible as Lands; and the Considerable Free-holder,
whose Estate is generally held in his own hands,
and managed by himself, and consequently was less
discovered than the Nobleman and Gentleman's that
were Rented, and made both the Profit of Landlord
and Tenant; which, according to the Old Maxim,
is double the Rent in Greensod, and treble in Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
the Charge of the latter amounting to a Third
more than Greensod: So that in truth, they have
all their Livelihood allowed, and more in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue;
and none of all these being obliged by their
Quality or Custom to any Port, and are the proper
Basis of a Democracy, or Common-wealth; these
were generally Rated more strictly without any
allowance, to prevent the increase of their Number
and Growth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Common Artificer and Labourer
having a dependance upon the Nobility and Gentry,
and not being able to subsist without them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
a farther support to the Monarchy, were
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100024:5"/>
usually Exempted, unless by reason of Money or
Personal Estate they fell within the limits of the
Subsidy; from hence grew that Ancient saying,
That in Taxes, <hi>Size-cinq,</hi> was to be easie, <hi>Quatre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trois,</hi>
to be fully charged, and <hi>Deaux ace,</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted.
Nevertheless, in the <hi>Poll-Acts,</hi> which
came but rarely, these Inferior sort were sometimes
brought in to bear their part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the <hi>Quantum,</hi> manner of Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Equality of Imposition, these Rules were
observed: <hi>First,</hi> That it did not exceed by any
means the Common Necessity; and that the Prince
as well as the Parliament, should shew a great ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of the People in their Demands and Levies
upon them; of which we have a notable instance in
<hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> who released half the Subsidies grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her,
when her Occasions did not require it;
which had a mighty influence upon future Grants.
And 'tis observeable, That all those Princes who
have not stretched Prerogative to Levy Taxes not
warrantable by Law, or to Levy them with too
much rigor and exactness, or to impoverish the
People, and have express'd a care and regard to their
Ease, Wealth, and Welfare, have ever been the
most Fortunate, Great, and Prosperous; contrary
to the Maxims of the present Age.</p>
            <p>As to the manner of Collection, they have taken
great Care that there should be as much Ease, and
as little Charge to the King or People in the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as may be, by the multiplication of Officers, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
or Subjecting their Houses, or Estates, to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100024:5"/>
the Inquiries, or Informations of Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Equality of Imposition; this has been
strictly observed, being always the same Rate in the
Pound. Nevertheless, with such Qualifications,
and Exceptions, as made it rather a Moral Equality,
than a Mathematical one, having respect to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Persons, as I have before shewed.
Limiting the Sums both for Real and Personal
Estates, below which they should not be Charged,
<hi>viz.</hi> Allowing Defalcations for Debts to be asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by the Oaths of the Parties Charg'd, and for
the Decay of Cities and Towns in Tenths and
Fifteenths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> In all Cases the King appointed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
generally of Persons unconcern'd in the
Places where they acted, and at his own Charge,
that it might be done with the more Indifference
and Equality, to whom, in truth, by the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the appointing of all Officers for the execution
of the Laws does belong; and once at least in every
Age, as I could easily shew, the Parliament had
granted that the Commissioners and Assessors should
be Sworn, and have liberty to examine all Persons,
not exempting the Parties themselves, upon Oath.
For the better discovery of their Real and Personal
Estates, that length of time might not produce too
great an Inequality; and that the Aids might be
improved in some proportion to the value of things,
of Labour, and of Service, and the Improvement
of the Wealth of the People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100024:6"/>
As to the <hi>Second</hi> Point concerning the Taxes
now in being, or in Vogue: And <hi>First,</hi> as to the
Land-Tax, or Monthly Assessment, being nothing
but a Military Contribution taken up in the Civil
War, and proportion to the Condition of the
Kingdom, as it then stood Forty Years ago;
the inequality is so exorbitant, both between
County and County, Division and Division,
Parish and Parish, and impossible to be rectified
without a punctual Survey of the whole, and
lying wholly upon the Landlord, where Estates
are not upon Lives or Fines; wherein the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
Clergy pay not one Groat, nor Money,
nor Personal Estate come in to the Aid; and
which lies so heavy upon the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
above all others, to the weakning and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
their Estates, who are the chief Support
of the Monarchy: I take it to be the most Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
and Unreasonable method of Raising great
Sums by, that ever was introduced in any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and impossible to be long born and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the double Excise; though
this has some influence upon our Barley and
Malt, and lies hardest upon our Inn-keepers and
Ale-house keepers, by the discouragement of the
Vent; yet were the Armies well paid, <hi>which is
their greater hardship,</hi> I see no great inconveniency
in the continuance of it, during this occasion of
the War, especially since it introduces no new
Charge in the Collection, nor subjects any new
Persons to Penalties or Officers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100024:6"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the new Impositions upon the
Customs, during this War at least, they may be
born, though that of Sugars, which began before
the War, may require some relief, at least when the
War is ended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Poll-Tax, as it now stands, is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to the meaner sort, as to their Children, and
deserves to be better considered; and tho much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
against, yet is an Ancient Way of Taxing
upon extraordinary occasions; and in all other things
far more equal than the former were, which tax'd
Titles and Professions alike: And tho it be objected,
That all Noblemen and Gentlemen pay alike, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the difference of Estates; yet consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the Lands are all under a double Tax, and
that they multiply that Tax according to the Horses
that they find in the Militia, I think they are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
charg'd, and much more equal than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
methods: And that this Tax is not wholly to be
laid aside, but may be easily rectified and made
useful.</p>
            <p>As to New Projects that have been much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
of, I shall reduce them to Two Heads. First,
Things of large Credit, upon some Perpetual Funds.
And secondly, The Home-Excises. As to the first,
There are two Difficulties to be overcome, to make
these practicable; first, To find out such a Fund;
which if upon the present Revenue, will be a lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it; if upon any Fund being perpetual, may
meet with some Difficulties in the Grant; and in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100024:7"/>
the next place, the Novelty of the thing, the loss
of a Principal for a Perpetual Interest, or the long
distance of time if it be repaid; upon which Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
all these Projects are founded; the Breach of
the Exchequer-Credit by King <hi>Charles,</hi> and ever
since, and the frequent breaking of the Bankers,
will make men very shy of parting with their Money
upon new Projects at a distance. Nevertheless if it
were tried for a small <hi>Sum</hi> at the beginning, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been experienced to be so useful, beneficial, and
practicable by our Neighbours the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and is in
it self very reasonable, it might gain some Place and
Credit here, and would supply the Want of Money
in <hi>Specie;</hi> which, for want of bringing our Coin
down to the value of Silver and Gold, the Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Balance of Trade, and the occasions for
Money abroad to our Armies and Confederates, is
so much lessen'd, that it does very much require
some Expedient; especially when Publick Taxes
are so great.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I shall proceed to consider of
that of raising Moneys by Excise upon our Home-Commodities.</p>
            <p>First, A General Excise upon Home Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
is a Real Land-Tax, and will have the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the Value of Lands and Rents, as that
we call a Land Tax, or Monthly-Assessment, hath;
and will raise at least Seven, if not Ten times as
much, and consequently be as bad as a Land-Tax so
many times double. Which I thus prove: The
difference must be either in the Matter, or the
Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100024:7"/>
As to the Matter first; A General Excise upon
Home Commodities, and a Land Tax, or Monthly
Contribution, differ not essentially, since both are
a Duty upon the same Commodities, which are the
Product of Land; only in this their main difference
consists, That a Monthly Contribution is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in gross <hi>per Mensem,</hi> for all the Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
the Land produceth; and a General Excise is
by Retail upon every Particular and Parcel thereof.</p>
            <p>As to the Manner, their main difference consists
in Three things: First, As to the Persons that pay it.
<hi>2dly,</hi> As to the Time of Payment. <hi>3dly,</hi> As to the
Equality of the Imposition. All which shall be
considered in this Second Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it will have the same influence as
a Monthly Contribution so many times double, and
not prove an insensible Tax, as is commonly alledg'd,
will easily appear by considering two things: First,
Whether it will chiefly lye upon the Buyer or the
Seller, and consequently cause a Rise or Fall upon
Commodities. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether it be likely in
point of Time and Equality, to afford any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Advantage to the Seller.</p>
            <p>As to the first, It must be measured by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the Buyer or Seller; for it is an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Truth, That if the Necessity of the Buyer be
greater than the Seller, the Market will rise; but
if that of the Seller be greater than the Buyer, the
Price of Commodities must fall; and any Duty laid
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100024:8"/>
upon Commodities will lye upon either accordingly.
But as to the present Case in <hi>England,</hi> I think there
is nothing more apparent, than the Plenty of Home-Commodities,
and the want of People to cousume
them, which is in truth the principal Cause of the
present Fall of Rents, and the Price of Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
the consequence of which necessarily will be,
That whatever Duty is impos'd upon the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
the Buyer will have it so much the cheaper,
since it is in his choice of whom to buy, and indeed
who shall sell, and who not. As to Time and Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
it must be allowed that the Excise hath some
advantage of the Land Tax, since the time of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not until Sale, and all men seem to pay alike
for the same thing; yet when it shall be considered,
that most of the Trade of this kind is upon Credit,
and not for Ready-Money, and that when Ready-Money
is paid, a great Abatement of the Price
is expected; and that the Commodity doth
vastly differ in Price and Goodness, and yet
shall pay all alike, as Beef, Mutton, and Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and above all, that the Commodity will be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then'd
above seven fold by this Payment in parcels;
it will be found these Advantages will be much
over-ballanced; to which I may add the vast charge,
trouble and slavery in the Collection, which draw
forth from the Subject twice as much as will
come to the King's Coffers, and beget an Army of
Officers, and a further Army of Souldiers to second
them; a Consideration of importance, more than
all the rest, and renders it of all Practices the
worst.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100024:8"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A general Home-Excise will destroy
Trade, which will appear thus: Whether the
Fund of Trade in <hi>England</hi> be Money, or Home-Commodities;
now there is nothing more evident,
than that the main Trade of <hi>England</hi> is in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of our Home-Commodities, and not that of
Money, which is the main that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Trade is
driven withall, they having few Commodities of
their own Countries to export, nor indeed enough to
support the <hi>20th</hi> part of their own people, which
renders this kind of Tax most proper there, though
very destructive here, all Impositions still discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Vent of the Commodities on which they
are impos'd, as the Experience of all former times
and places doth abundantly prove; besides the great
consumption of all Foreign Commodities here, is
by such as have dependance on the product of their
Countrey, and not upon Trade, as they all do in
<hi>Holland;</hi> the Vent of which, if discourag'd or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen'd,
abates the Foreign Trade likewise, and the
Commodities impos'd upon there, are most Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,
but here Native; and Estates there personal,
but here real.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This will overthrow the substance of
all the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>England</hi> by the fall
of the Value of their Lands and Rents; for if the
present Land-Tax hath produced an Effect to such
a degree already, and that by experience we find
the Land Tax draws more Money out of the
Countrey than what it can bear, disabling the
Tenant to pay his Rent, or carry on the Trade
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100024:9"/>
in the Countrey, otherwise than upon Credit;
what must the Case be when 7, or 10 times as
much will be rais'd upon the same thing by this
New way?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A General Excise puts an end to the
use of Parliaments, and quite changes the present
Constitution of the Government; for having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given duties in all Foreign Commodities,
should they admit of this upon Native, there were
no more to be given, nor could it be carried on
without a Military Power to second it, and might
possibly hazard the Government it self, if the
people should not swallow it; and if once got up,
will never be laid down.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It can be of no use to a present Supply,
since it will ask a long time to settle it; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
afford much Money, or Credit, till it be so
setled; and that the Experiment be try'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it can, or will be born, which this Town,
under the Oppression of a War and Power of an
Army, would not yield to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be objected,</hi> That the <hi>Dutch</hi> raise greater
Sums thereby, than we can any other way, and by
that are enabled to make War more powerfully than
We.</p>
            <p>This is a perfect mistake; for their Excise is
not able to answer the ordinary Charge of the
Government, and is in truth their ordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue;
and their War is maintain'd by their 200,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100024:9"/>
and 100 Penny-Tax, by way of our Subsidy upon
Personal Estate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That this will raise near thrice as much
as will come to the King, will thus appear; In the
Vent of all our Home-Commodities, especially in
any considerable Quantities, there is one at least
that goes between the Grower and first Seller, and
the Consumer; as the Malster, and Brewer, or
Alehouse-keeper, between the Barley, and the
Drink; the Engrosser, Meal-man or Baker, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
our Wheat and our Bread; the Butchers
between our Meat; and the Butcher and Tallow-Chandler,
between our Suet and Candles; the
Higler, Carrier, or Polterer, between our Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
and Wild-fowl; Iron, Lead, Wool, Tin,
Leather and Salt, between the first Founder and
Maker, their Retailers, and other Trades that
are employ'd in the Manufactures that are made
of them. Now it cannot reasonably be suppos'd,
That whoever is the first Buyer of these things,
or any other that goes between the Buyer and
the Consumer, will pay the full Price to the
Grower, and pay the Duty of Excise out of his
own Purse, which will require a greater Stock;
and gather it in again of the Consumer, without
Interest, or Profit, much of which Trade will be
upon Credit, some of it comes short home, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since it is in his power to abate it in the
Price from the first Grower.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, he will certainly raise it in the
Price to the Consumer again; and so the Penny
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100024:10"/>
will be doubled, and probably raise the Price
more than the Duty, upon supposition that he
pays the Duty, and may come to be a loser by
it; and this being disperst all the Kingdom over,
must needs create a vast number of Officers and
charge in the Collection to the King; to which
I may add, the great Penalties with which it must
be supported, and attended; and the keenness of
the Officers to exact them, and the great discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
all this will bring upon the Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with the great disturbance and slavery that
it will bring upon the people, to have their Houses
subjected to the Searches of Officers, and their
Persons and Estates to Entries of Goods, and to
Penalties upon that account. Now the Case is
not the same in <hi>Holland</hi> as to any of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
before-mentioned, as will appear by these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For that it is their interest to discourage
the Consumption, and to occasion Parcimony, most
of the Commodities being Foreign; and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Export of them, upon which their whole
Trade and Livelihood depends, but ours the quite
contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secendly,</hi> They can certainly raise the Price upon
the first Buyer, because of the Scarcity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity;
and that besides that little which the
Countrey affords, 'tis all in the hands of some few
Merchants or Engrossers; and the Necessity of
the Buyer is far greater than that of the Seller,
through the Multitude of Inhabitants, and the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100024:10"/>
Smalness of the Product for Necessaries for
Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Their Collection is very easy and
cheap; for the Merchant secures the Excise upon
his first Entry at the Custom-House; and for the
rest, they have no Market but in Wall'd and
Populous Towns; so that it is all collected
there with few hands, and little Trouble to the
People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> All the Excises of <hi>Holland,</hi> both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Foreign Commodities and Home, though
multiplied and advanced to the last degree, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the other Revenues that belong
to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Church, have
been computed but at Two Millions a Year,
Monasteries and Tythes included, and are anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated
by Debts for several Years; and but
sufficient to pay the Interest; and 'tis the 200
Penny, and 100 Penny upon Personal Estates;
that is the thing that supports their Wars upon
extraordinary Occasions; and therefore probably,
the Excises here will not raise such Sums as we
imagine, especially upon some few things;
and yet the Charge, Slavery, and the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
before mentioned, will be equal;
and the hazard the Government will run in
rendring it odious and disgustful to the People,
are so great; and above all it can turn to no
account but for a continuance of time; and that
it is a foundation for any Government, or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100024:11"/>
Prince that would subvert the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and enslave the People, to support an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and carry on his designs if once intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
by the continuance of it; and therefore
I think no <hi>English</hi> man will be willing to make
the experiment.</p>
            <p>As to the last Particular I undertook, which
was to give my Opinion what methods were
the most eligible to raise Money by; having in
some measure prevented it by passing my Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
upon those that are now in practice and
vogue; I shall conclude all with proposing
that of the Ancient way of Subsidy upon a true
Pound Rate, according to the Wisdom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practice of our Ancestors, as the most
equal, most reasonable, and most suitable to
our Constitution; and therefore most eligible
above all others: Which I shall endeavour to
prove by these Arguments following, and by
Answering those Objections that are usually
made against it.</p>
            <p>But before I come to these particulars, I
think it necessary to give some general Account
of the Ancient Form and Method of Subsidies,
Tenths and Fifteenths; the Two latter having
been totally disused, and the former but rarely,
and not pursuant to the old Method, since the
beginning of the Civil War;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> L. Coke's Instit. 4. <hi>pa. 33, &amp;</hi> 34.</note> a Subsidy before
the War did usually amount to 70,000 Pound,
the last Subsidy-Book being the Rule by which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100024:11"/>
the future were given; wherein every man's
Land was valued at a certain Rate beyond Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises;
and this was not altered but once in an
Age, when there was an Act made on purpose
to make a review by the Oaths of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
Assessors, and examination of the
Parties themselves, or any other person knowing
therein; and all the variation otherwise in the
Subsidies, was in the Personal Estate and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and the allowance for Debts, and a great
number of Children, to which they had regard
upon application made by the Parties, pursuant
to the Provision in those Acts; all Persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Five pound in Personal, and Three Pound
in Real, as formerly Rated in the King's Books
above Reprises, were excep<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed; and all Goods
and Stock in Trade and Houshold-stuff, except
wearing Apparel, were included: And a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy
was Four Shillings in the Pound upon
Real Estate, and Two Shillings Eight-pence
upon Personal, payable by Two Payments.
And Although Two Shillings Eight-pence may
seem to be less upon Goods, than Four Shillings
upon Lands; yet when it is considered, that
Lands are Rated according to the Annual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits;
and not their intrinsick Value of Purchase;
and that this is almost treble the profit of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
at Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> and that all other Goods
have no Profit or Interest to attend them,
Personal Estate is more than doubly Charged, as
I have before Asserted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100024:12"/>
As to the Tenths and Fifteenths, they were
a certain Rate impos'd on Cities, Towns,
and Boroughs, in respect of their Moveable
Goods, and did amount to about 20,000 Pound;
but there was usually a Clause, to reserve
a Sum for such Cities and Towns as were
decayed.</p>
            <p>As to the Arguments for the Subsidy or
Pound-Rate, having said so much already, I shall
reduce them to very few Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That it is equal in the Imposition, no
body can deny; nor that none can pay more
than he is rated, by any body's being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is made more equal and
reasonable, by the allowance of Debts, empty
Houses, drown'd or unprofitable Lands: But
as for Lands, Let or Unlet, since the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
may be made in hand, as well as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
there was never any Allowance; the
Reasons not being the same with Houses, which
are a burthen, and yield no Profit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here the Clergy, and all that
have Estates upon old Rents, and Personal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
in Money, Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall pay; though
the Assessments brought in the full Value, yet
the Commissioners did make an Allowance for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100024:12"/>
the Port of the Person, according to his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>But I come now to those Objections which are
usually made against it; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That it is impracticable, as late Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
hath proved.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it will not raise such Sums
as are requisite for the present Juncture.</p>
            <p>To the first of these I answer, That the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of all former Ages is a sufficient Evidence;
and the Reasons of the late Failure have been two
visible ones:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Countenance that the Monthly
Assessment hath met with from the Court; and
the Discountenance this hath found, when the
Parliament granted the first <hi>12d.</hi> Aid, and the King
to name Commissioners, that they put in all the
same again which were in the Monthly Assessment;
which as it was the highest Disservice imaginable to
the Crown, in favour of their particular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
so it is like to prove the most fatal to
the Nation, disabling it to raise any great Sums
from the great inequality of it, and inclining
the Party oppress'd to embrace any New Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that may hazard the present Government,
or prove destructive to the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100024:13"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The zealous Endeavours of the <hi>Western</hi>
and <hi>Northern</hi> Members to continue the Monthly As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessment,
which is so favourable to them; which
when they consider the Consequences before-mentioned,
I hope will be no longer insisted
on, at such a time as this, when all that's dear
to them is at stake. But to shew that this is
easily practicable, if the Parli<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ment will follow
the Methods heretofore used by their Ancestors,
I shall refer you to the Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Margin<note n="*" place="margin">32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Ca. 50 p. 715. the Assessors and Parties pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Oath.</note>, and to
those Acts, which you will find in
the Statutes at large,<note place="margin">34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Ca. 28. p. 833. the same.</note> where the
Assessors were upon Oath,<note place="margin">37 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Ca. 25. p. 893. the same.</note> and the
Commissioners named by the King
with power to examine all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
upon Oath.<note place="margin">2 <hi>&amp; 3 Edw.</hi> the 6th. Ca. 36. p. 970, &amp; 971. the same.</note> But if these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
be thought too rigorous,<note place="margin">3 <hi>&amp; 4 Edw.</hi> the 6th. Ca. 23. p. 1004, 1005. the same.</note>
I propose that the Commissioners
may only be of his Nomination,<note place="margin">7 <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th Ca. 12. p. 1052, 1053. the same.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Right of the Crown,<note place="margin">4 <hi>&amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar.</hi> Ca. 13. p. 1158, &amp; 1159. the same.</note>
and the Practice of all Ages, whose
only Power is to see the Assessors do their duty
to put the law in just Execution; and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man may be bound to deliver into the Asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
the true Value of the Lands in the place
where it lies, according as it is rented; and if in
their Hands, according to the highest value that
it pays in Parish-Taxes, with any thing that is
Rented, under pain to Forfeit a Year's Value
for every concealment of all that he hath in that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100024:13"/>
Place. And that the Commissioners have Power
to examine any other but the Person himself
concerning the Value of the Lands, and the
Parish-Taxes, in order to an equal Pound Rate,
and to Levy the Penalties upon concealments.
And if it shall be thought reasonable to allow
any thing for the Port of the person, that it be
ascertain'd by a tenth, or any other part to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to the Commissioners from Persons above
a Certain Quality, but to lose that benefit upon
any Concealment.</p>
            <p>As to the not raising a Considerable Sum,
there can by no way be so much rais'd, as
by this; for we find by Experience, that the
Monthly Assessment, though now screwed up
higher than ever, does not raise above 1651702 <hi>l.
18 s.</hi> but every 12 <hi>d.</hi> in the Pound will raise
a Million, and the Four Shillings that were
given by way of 12 <hi>d.</hi> Aid the first year, would
have rais'd Four Millions, which I prove thus:
The Monthly Assessment at 70,000 <hi>l. per men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sem,</hi>
raises 840,000 <hi>l. per annum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and of this
I am sure not near a third part of <hi>England</hi> pays
above 12 <hi>d.</hi> in the Pound, and some not above
Three pence, and so upward to a Shilling: Now
if these two thirds were brought to pay a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and the others reduc'd, I leave it to any
reasonable man to judge, Whether the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
160,000 <hi>l.</hi> would not have been rais'd, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially

That all the Home-Excise of the Province of
<hi>Holland,</hi> as I have been credibly informed, do not
raise above a Million, and the rest of the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
not above half a one, tho multiplied and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the utmost: And therefore if laid only
upon some few things here, would not raise
such Sums as are imagin'd; and for that reason
also not worth the Experiment, to change the
Ancient Methods of our Ancestors, which will
be found in the Conclusion the most Equal and
Reasonable of all others.</p>

            <p>THis Paper being writ and calculated for
the Year 1692. before the Parliament Sat,
and had adjusted their Aids, a full and successful
Experiment has been made for a Million upon a
perpetual Fund, and probably might bear half a
Million more, if the time for Subscription and
Fund were enlarged; there has also been tryal of
another 4 s. Pound-Rate, which by reason all
Oaths were waved, and very small Penalties put
upon the Concealment, and the Commissioners not
of the King's Nomination, as I am informed,
hath fallen short of the Two Millions that were
expected from it; so that other Methods must be
taken, as are herein before proposed, if you would
make it any thing equal or effectual. There has
also been new Impositions laid on several Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
which by the Neglect and Miscarriage of
Convoys, and want of Station-Ships and Cruizers
to clear the Channel from Privateers, as to Trade
in General, but more Particularly to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100024:15"/>
Turky,</hi> and <hi>West-India</hi> Trade,
have produced but very little; also the Duties
upon Sugar have been wholly taken off, which
might have been born during the War. These
things I thought necessary to observe, since they
have made Alterations in some Matters contained in
this <hi>Essay.</hi>
