         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>After <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons were Conſecrated to the Prieſtly-Office, they coming to attend this their Office, the very firſt day after their conſecration to offer Incenſe unto God, they ventured to offer Incenſe with ſtrange Fire, with other Fire than
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104284:7"/>
God had appointed: Upon that the fire of Gods wrath broke out upon them, and ſlew them both preſently in the very San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary before all the people, for it was a ſolemn time: being the beginning of the ſolemn Conſecration of the Prieſt-hood. Upon this, the ſpirit of <hi>Aaron</hi> could not but be exceedingly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to ſee his two Sons thus ſtruck Now <hi>Moſes</hi> comes to him and ſaith, This is that which the Lord ſpake, <hi>I will be ſanctified in them that draw nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified.</hi> And upon this, <hi>Aaron</hi> held his peace.</p>
            <p>We reade that once fire came down from Heaven in a way of Mercy to conſume the Sacrifices: but now fire comes down from Heaven in a way of Judgment to conſume the Sacrificers, even <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu:</hi> they were <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons, the Sons of a godly man, the Sons of the High-Prieſt, they were his eldeſt Sons, for <hi>Aaron</hi> had other Sons beſides <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazar</hi> and <hi>Ithamar,</hi> but theſe were his two eldeſt Sons: they were two yong men, they were ſtruck in the very prime of their age, they were two that were newly conſecrated in the Prieſts Office, for ſo you find it in the 9. Chap. And they were two men of renown in the Country, and before all the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> two men that God had much honored heretofore; as you ſhall find in <hi>Exod.</hi> Chap. 24. and the beginning; this <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were men of great repute, and great renown, that God did much honor in former times; for when God called <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> with the Elders to come to him, he ſingles out <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bihu</hi> amongſt the reſt, and names them. And he ſaid unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> Come up unto the Lord, thou and <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi> and 70. of the Elders of <hi>Iſrael. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> are only named, and then 70. of the Elders in general, but <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Nadab,</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> as if theſe were the four emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men of renown among all the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he names none of the 70. Elders but theſe two, beſides <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron:</hi> therefore theſe two that were conſumed by ſtrange fire, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned men, and newly conſecrated into their Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What was their ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their ſin it was offering of ſtrange fire, ſo the text ſaith that they offered <hi>ſtrange fire,</hi> which God commanded them not, in the beginning of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:104284:7"/>
But had God ever forbidden it? Where do we find that ever God had forbidden them to offer ſtrange Fire, or appointed that they ſhould offer only one kind of Fire? There is no text of Scripture that you can find from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to this place, where God hath ſaid in <hi>terminis,</hi> in ſo many words expreſly, <hi>You ſhall offer no fire but one kind of fire.</hi> And yet here they are conſumed by Fire from God, for offering ſtrange Fire. I find in the 30. of <hi>Exod.</hi> ver. 9. that there they were forbidden offering ſtrange Incenſe, but I do not find that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden offering ſtrange Fire. In <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. 13. and divers verſes in that Chapter we find that God had appointed that they ſhould keep conſtantly the Fire on the Altar burning, and never to let it go out: Now that was (it ſeems) Gods intention that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould make uſe of that Fire, and that Fire only. God would have them to pick out his meaning: God ſent Fire down from Heaven upon the Altar, ſo in the latter end of the 9. chap. God ſent down Fire from Heaven, and gave them a charge to keep that Fire on the Altar conſtantly, and never to let it go out: ſo that it ſeems God would have them pick out his meaning, that becauſe he had ſent down Fire from Heaven upon the Altar, and gave them power to keep that conſtantly, God would have them therefore to underſtand, that what Incenſe or Sacrifice he would have the uſe of Fire in, it ſhould be only that Fire and no other, though God did never ſay to them directly in theſe words, <hi>You ſhall make uſe of this fire and no other,</hi> but God would have them to <hi>underſtand</hi> this. That's their ſin therefore in offering of ſtrange Fire. Now Fire comes from the Lord and doth conſume them. Some think this Fire came from the Altar, but ſurely it could not be any ordinary Fire that did conſume <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> at this time: for you ſhall find in the next ver. to my text, That the bodies of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were not conſumed by the Fire, no, not their cloathes, they were kil'd by the Fire and yet their cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes were whol, therefore it was not an ordinary Fire, it was ſome Coeleſtial Fire ſtruck into them to ſlay them, for ſo ſaith the text in the 4. ver. <hi>Come neer, carry away your Brethren from before the Sanctuary out of the Camp: and ſo they went and carried them in their crats out of the Camp,</hi> ſo that their cloathes and bodies were not conſumed, only they were kil'd by the Fire: they were ſtruck
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104284:8"/>
with a ſudden death, and that in the preſence of the Lord: ſuch a death as God had never threatned in the Word before, God had never threatned the Prieſts and ſaid, If you offer ſtrange Fire you ſhall be conſumed by Fire: but yet God ſmites them with death by Fire, they had not time to ſeek God, no not ſo much (as we uſe to ſay) as to ſay, Lord have mercy upon me: they had no time to promiſe amendment at all: now upon this heavy judgment, the, heart of <hi>Aaron</hi> could not poſſibly but be very much troubled, yea, and the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> too, for <hi>Moſes</hi> was their Unkle, and <hi>Aaron</hi> their father, they could not but be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly much grieved: but <hi>Moſes</hi> being the brother of <hi>Aaron,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſpirit (no queſtion) exceedingly troubled, being under ſuch a ſad affliction, and that ſuch a Godly man even as <hi>Aaron</hi> was, ſhould have ſuch a ſad judgment befal his children: <hi>Moſes</hi> comes and ſpeaks comfortably to him, and labors to ſupport his ſpirit: and how doth he do it? He comes not as ordinarily you uſe to viſit your brethren, <hi>Oh! you muſt be content with this:</hi> no, but he comes and applies the Word of God, and ſhews how God muſt be ſanctified; and by that he comes to quiet the heart of his brother <hi>Aaron</hi> This is that which the Lord hath ſpoke ſaith <hi>Moſes:</hi> He ſeeks to ſtay the heart of his brother with that which God ſpake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But where do we find that God ſpake this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's hard to find in any Scripture theſe very words in <hi>terminis</hi> before this time: and therefore <hi>Auguſtin</hi> thinks it was only the word God <hi>ſpake,</hi> but not <hi>written,</hi> and ſo they had it from hand to hand by tradition as many other things, as the Propheſie of <hi>Enoch</hi> that the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of, you do not find it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of God, and yet the Apoſtle ſpeaks of it, ſo that indeed it was from hand to hand: yea and we find in the new Teſtament when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of a thing that Chriſt ſhould ſay, how that our Lord ſaith, <hi>It is a more bleſſed thing to give than to receive;</hi> you find it not recorded in the Goſpels that Chriſt ſaid ſo. So, this is that which the Lord ſaid, though it was not written from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> to this very place, or otherwiſe though it be not recorded in expreſs terms, yet ſomthing is recorded to the ſame purpoſe and effect: and ſo it may ſeem to have reference to that Scripture <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 43. there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104284:8"/>
we have a Scripture comes as neer to it as any I know. And <hi>there wil I meet with the children of Iſrael, and the tabernacle ſhal be ſanctified by my glory,</hi> that's as much in effect, as <hi>I will be ſanctified in thoſe that come nigh me,</hi> in thoſe that come to worſhip me in my Tabernacle, I will be ſanctified in all things that concern my <hi>Worſhip,</hi> I will be ſure to be ſanctified there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will be ſanctified]</hi> I will be <hi>Hallowed,</hi> for it is the very ſame that you have in the Lords Prayer, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> only that's the <hi>Greek</hi> word, and this is the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> but if you would tranſlate this word into <hi>Greek,</hi> you muſt tranſlate it by the ſame word that Chriſt ſpake when he taught his Diſciples to pray, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> Hallowed and Sanctified is all one. Lord let thy Name appear to be Holy: ſo <hi>I will be Sanctified,</hi> that is, I will have my Name appear to be Holy, I will be made known unto my People, and to all the world that I am a <hi>Holy</hi> God: that's the meaning of, <hi>I will be Sanctified,</hi> I will be known to all the world that I am a <hi>Holy</hi> God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And before all the people I will be Glorified,</hi> ſo it is in the latter part of the verſe, as if God ſhould ſay I account it to be my <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> that I ſhould be manifeſted to be <hi>Holy</hi> before all the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will be Sanctified;</hi> that is, I will have my People to demean and carry themſelves ſo, as to hold forth their acknowledgment of my <hi>Holineſs</hi> ſo, as by their carriage I may appear to be a <hi>Holy</hi> God. I will be ſanctified by them, or otherwiſe if they ſhall not in an active way <hi>Sanctifie</hi> my Name, that is, if they ſhall not demean themſelves ſo as to hold forth the glory of my <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> then I will be ſanctified upon them; I will demean and carry my ſelf towards them ſo, as by my actions upon them, I will make it appear what a <hi>Holy</hi> God I am: So God is Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two waies, either by the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of his People, in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards him holding forth the glory of Gods <hi>Holineſs:</hi> and ſo in that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts;</hi> the Saints do Sanctifie God in their hearts when they fear God as a <hi>Holy</hi> God, and Reverence him, and Love him as a holy God, and ſo ſanctifie him in their lives, when their lives do hold forth the glory of Gods <hi>Holineſs,</hi> then God is Sanctified.</p>
            <p>But then if we do not do ſo, then God ſanctifies himſelf, that is in waies of <hi>Judgment</hi> upon thoſe that do not in waies of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:104284:9"/>
ſanctifie his Name. And thus you have it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 22. <hi>And ſay, Thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold I am againſt thee O Zidon, and I wil be glorified in the midſt of thee, and they ſhal know that I am the Lord, when I ſhall have executed judgment in her, and ſhal be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in her.</hi> And this is al one with <hi>I wil be glorified in the midſt of them.</hi> And in the 38. of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 23. you have to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>And thou ſhalt come up againſt my people of Iſrael, as a cloud to cover the Land: it ſhal be in the latter daies: and I wil bring thee againſt my Land that the Heathen may know me, when I ſhall be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in thee O Gog, before their eyes.</hi> And in the 23. ver. <hi>Thus wil I magnifie my ſelf, and ſanctifie my ſelf, and will be known in the eyes of many Nations, and they ſhall know that I am the Lord,</hi> in the way of the execution of Judgment: thus I will ſanctifie my ſelf, ſo I will be ſanctified in thoſe that draw nigh me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In thoſe that are nigh me] Nigh ones,</hi> ſo it may be read: that is, eſpecially the <hi>Prieſts</hi> that did approach to God. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 42. 13. they approach to God eſpecially. But it is meant generally of all thoſe that ſhall have to deal in my <hi>Worſhip,</hi> whoſoever ſhall come to <hi>Worſhip</hi> me, let them look to it, they muſt ſanctifie my Name, they muſt ſo demean themſelves in my <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as to hold forth my Name to be <hi>Holy:</hi> or otherwiſe, I will manifeſt my ſelf againſt them in the waies of <hi>Judgment,</hi> for I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a <hi>Holy</hi> God. I will have the glory of my <hi>Holineſs</hi> one way or other (ſaith God) in thoſe that come neer Me; As if God ſhould ſay, Though it's otherwiſe with men, they indeed will be ready to favor thoſe that are <hi>neer</hi> them, but I will not do ſo. Men will ſooner paſs by the offences of thoſe that are <hi>neer</hi> them, than thoſe that are not: as ſuppoſe that a ſtranger com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits an offence, you would be ſevere towards him; but ſuppoſe it were one of your own Children, or Kinſmen, what would you do then? Do not we ſee that men will rather favor their own Kindred than ſtrangers, though the offence be the ſame? But I will not do ſo ſaith God. Suppoſe it be one of your own family, wil not you be ready to excuſe them? Suppoſe it were your own child that ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſuch an offence, Oh! what friends would you make to take him off from puniſhment? Though men would do ſo towards their own, yet be bitter &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere towards ſtrangers; Yet I wil not be ſo ſaith God: Let thoſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104284:9"/>
that are <hi>neer</hi> me look to it, I will be ſanctified by them. I will be ſanctified in thoſe that draw <hi>neer</hi> me.</p>
            <p>Now upon this, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid thus, That God would be ſanctified in thoſe that draw neer him: this was <hi>Moſes</hi> ſcope to <hi>Aaron,</hi> as if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>Aaron,</hi> though I confeſs the hand of God is heavy upon you this day: Yet it is fit for you to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to God, 'tis fit that God ſhould be glorified what ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of you; you are dear to God, but Gods Name is <hi>dearer</hi> to him than you are: what ever the lives of your ſons were, yet it is fit that God ſhould be honored, and his Name <hi>Sanctified</hi> what ever become of your Sons, or of your Comforts, and therfore let your heart be quieted, you have had a great loſs and affliction upon you; but God hath had glory; God hath glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified himſelf. How hath God glorified himſelf? Very much by this way; for God by this way hath done an act to make all the People of the Land fear before him; to cauſe them to <hi>Worſhip</hi> him with al reverence. All the people of the Land ſeeing ſuch a Judgment as this, and hearing of it; they will learn for ever to fear and reverence this God: they will ſay, How ſhall we appear before this <hi>Holy</hi> God? We had need take heed how we appear in his preſence, and <hi>Worſhip</hi> him according to the way that He Himſelf would be <hi>Worſhiped;</hi> As if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ſay, This Honor that God hath by this means in the hearts of his people; it is that that you ſhould account a greater good than the <hi>Lives</hi> of your Children, what ever they are. This is the ſcope of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeech to <hi>Aaron.</hi> Now upon this the Text ſaith:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aaron held his peace]</hi> He was ſilenced. It may be before, He was expreſſing himſelf in grief, and ſorrow'd exceeding much in words; but now he was quiet and had nothing to ſay: he did by his ſilence acknowledge his Children were deer to him, but it's fit that God ſhould be glorified what ever becomes of his Children, and therefore <hi>Aaron</hi> holds his peace.</p>
            <p>But the word that is here tranſlated, <hi>Holds his peace,</hi> It hath more in it than <hi>meer ſilence;</hi> for the Hebrews have another word that ſignifie meer ſilence of ſpeech: but this ſignifies, <hi>a ſtaying of the heart,</hi> that it doth not further proceed in and trouble of ſpirit, a ſilence in the very heart, and ſtaying of it; a ſtaying of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104284:10"/>
of the heart. I find the ſame word to be uſed in Scripture, when <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid to the Sun, <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> ſtay thy ſelf on <hi>Gibeon, Joſ</hi> 10. 12. It is the ſame word that is here tranſlated, <hi>and Aaron held his peace,</hi> that is, he was ſtayed from further vexing or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of himſelf, or being diſquieted; whereas his heart was in a ſtrong violent motion: Now <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeech did ſtop him, and gave a ſtop to his heart to make it ſtand ſtill in a wonderful manner, As the Sun, when <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpake to it to ſtand ſtill. As if the Lord ſhould have ſpoken to his heart, <hi>Aaron,</hi> thy heart is in a mighty ſtrong motion, but conſider that I muſt be ſanctified in thoſe that draw <hi>nigh</hi> me; and let all thoſe motions of thy heart be ſtopt and quiet. Thus now you ſee the meaning of the Scripture, and the Scope of it. Now in this Scripture you have theſe Three ſpecial and notable Points.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>That in worſhiping of God, there is a drawing nigh unto Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>That when we do draw nigh to God, we ſhould take heed to our ſelves that we ſanctifie Gods Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>If we do not ſanctifie Gods Name in our drawings nigh to Him, then certainly God will ſanctifie his own Name upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Three Points that I intend to handle; And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſecond to handle largely among you. I confeſs upon another occaſion in one Sermon I have ſpoke out of theſe words, but now I intend not only in general, to ſhew you how you ſhould ſanctifie Gods Name in <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but likewiſe in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Acts of Worſhip: As ſanctifying His Name in <hi>Prayer,</hi> in Receiving the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> in hearing the <hi>Word;</hi> in the ſeveral chief parts of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God, how his Name ſhould be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified: For in all theſe you do draw night to God. And for that end I have pitch'd my thoughts upon this Scripture. But before I come to theſe Three great Points, that are the principal Points in the words read unto you; I ſhall take up divers other Notes of obſervation that lie up and down as it were ſcattered, that are of great uſe, and will help us further to make uſe of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the other points that I ſhall come to afterward, and handle more largely.</p>
            <p>The firſt Note is this, <hi>That in Gods Worſhip there muſt be nothing tendered up to God but what he hath commanded, whatſoever we med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with in the</hi> Worſhip <hi>of God, it muſt be what we have a Warrant for out of the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:104284:10"/>
For this ſpeech of <hi>Moſes</hi> is upon occaſion of the Judgment of God upon <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons for offering ſtrange Fire: They offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Fire that God had not commanded. Hence I ſay, that all things in Gods worſhip muſt have a warrant out of Gods word, muſt be commanded, It's not enough that it is not forbidden: I beſeech you obſerve it: it is not enough that a thing is not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and what hurt is there in it? But it muſt be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: I confeſs in matters that are Civil and Natural, there this may be enough; If it be but according to the rules of prudence, and not forbidden in the word; we may make uſe of this in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Natural things. But now when we come to matters of Religion, and the Worſhip of God, we muſt either have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or ſome what out of Gods Word by ſome Conſequence drawn from ſome command wherein God manifeſts his will; either a direct command, or by comparing one thing with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or drawing conſequences plainly from the Words. We muſt have a warrant of the <hi>Worſhip of God.</hi> One would have thought that theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> offering <hi>Incenſe</hi> to the true God, what hurt was there in taking other <hi>Fire?</hi> But there was no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it, and therefore it was not accepted. It's true, there are ſome things in the <hi>Worſhip of God</hi> that are Natural and Civil helps, and there we need not have any Command: As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; when we come to <hi>worſhip God,</hi> the Congregation meets, they muſt have a convenient place to keep the air and weather from them: now this is but a natural help, and ſo far as I Uſe the place of Worſhip as a natural help I need have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But if I will put any thing in a <hi>Place</hi> beyond what it hath in its own nature, There I muſt look for a Cammand. For if I account one place more <hi>Holy</hi> than another; or to think that God ſhould accept of worſhip in one place rather than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: This is to raiſe it above what it is in its own Nature. So that when any creature is raſed in a Religious way, above what it hath in it by <hi>Nature;</hi> if I have not Scripture to warrant me I am therein ſuperſtitious. It's a very uſeful rule for to help you: If any Creature that you make any uſe of in a way of Religion beyond what it hath in its own <hi>Nature,</hi> if you have not ſome warrant from the <hi>Word of God</hi> (whatſoever ſpecious ſhew there may be in it) it is <hi>Superſtition.</hi> As now for the <hi>Place,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:104284:11"/>
there was a place that was Holy, <hi>but</hi> then it had an Inſtitution from God. And ſo for garments, to uſe thoſe that are decent, the light of reaſon is enough: but if I will put any thing upon them beyond what there is in them in their own Nature, as heretofore in a Surplis, what, Had that any more decency in its own nature, but only mans <hi>Inſtitution?</hi> Now when man ſhall put a Religious reſpect upon a thing, by vertue of his own Inſtitution when he hath not a warrant from God; here's ſuperſtition! we muſt al be <hi>Willing</hi> worſhipers, but not <hi>Wil-</hi>worſhipers; We muſt come freely to worſhip God; but we muſt not worſhip God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own wills, and therefore what ever we do in the Worſhip of God, if we have not a warrant for it, when this is ſaid, <hi>Who requireth this at your hands?</hi> It will ſtop our mouthes another day: In <hi>Matthew</hi> 15. 9. <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching for Doctrin the Commandements of men. In vain:</hi> it is a <hi>vain</hi> thing to Worſhip God, when there is nothing but a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of man for this Worſhip. If you would Worſhip God, you muſt have a Commandement of God for the worſhip: And in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. there is a place to the ſame purpoſe, that ſhews how the Lord is offended with any man that ſhal <hi>teach his fear</hi> by their <hi>own precepts, Wherefore the Lord ſaid, Foraſmuch as this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple draw neer me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards me taught by the precepts of men.</hi> Mark it: Now if this be ſo, the Lord have mercy upon us in this thing. You have cauſe to be humbled every one of you; I beleeve in ſome degree or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this Congregation very much, and moſt Congregations that have had the fear of God taught them by the precepts of men: How many things have there been in the Worſhip of God that you can ſhew no warrant in the Word for? A great many things meerly mens inventions, however they are now caſt out, becauſe Authority came in and caſt them out, and ſo you ſubmit to it; but that is not enough for you to ſubmit to it becauſe Authority would have it ſo; but you ought to be humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God for all your Will-worſhip, for all your yieldings to any thing in the Worſhip of God, that was <hi>taught by the precepts of men:</hi> You ſee how ſevere God was to <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> for but taking <hi>other fire</hi> than that which God had appointed to offer up
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104284:11"/>
Incenſe, though there was no direct Commandement againſt it. If the Lord hath ſpared you, and not manifeſted any diſpleaſure upon you, you have cauſe to acknowledg Gods mercy, and to be humbled for all your falſe worſhip; Certainly God doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from this Land to be humbled for their Wil-worſhip, or otherwiſe they <hi>ſow among thorns:</hi> All the Reformation that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, if there be not a humiliation before, for all our falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip; 'tis not enough that we ſet up now the true Worſhip of God, but we muſt be humbled for our falſe Worſhip. And that's the Firſt Note; That in the Worſhip of God there muſt be nothing but what God Commands.</p>
            <p>The Second Note is, <hi>In the matters of Worſhip, God ſtands upon little things:</hi> Such things as ſeem to be very ſmall and little to us, yet God ſtands much upon them in the matter of Worſhip. For there is nothing wherein the Prerogative of God doth more appear than in Worſhip: as Princes, they ſtand much upon their Prerogatives: Now God hath written the Law of natural Worſhip in our hearts, as that we ſhould love God, fear God, truſt in God, and pray to God; this God hath written in our hearts: But there are other things in the Worſhip of God that are not written in our hearts, that only depend upon the Will of God revealed in his Word, which were no duties except they were revealed in his Word. And theſe are of ſuch a nature as we can ſee no reaſon for, but only this, becauſe God will have them. As now, There are many kinds of Ceremonies to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt honor to Princes that there is no reaſon for them at all, but meerly becauſe it is a Civil Inſtitution ſo appointed: So God would have ſome waies for the honoring of him, that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould not ſee into the reaſon of them, but meerly the Will of God to have them ſo: Now God ſtands much upon little things, though men would think it a little matter whether this Fire, or that Fire, and will not this burn as well as that? But God ſtands upon it: And ſo for the Ark, when <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi> did but touch the Ark, when it was ready to fall, we would think it no great matter, but one touch of the Ark coſt him his life. There is not any one minnim in the Worſhip of God, but God ſtands mightily upon it: In the matter of the Sabbath, that's His Worſhip, for a poor man to gather a few ſticks, what great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104284:12"/>
is it? But God ſtands upon it. And ſo when the men of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemeſh</hi> did but look into the Ark, it coſt the lives of Fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand threeſcore and ten men. If it be a matter of a holy thing that concerns his Worſhip, he would not have it abuſed in any thing. Let us learn to make conſcience of little things in the Worſhip of God, and not to think, O how nice ſuch are, and how preciſe and nice in ſuch ſmal things! Thou doeſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the nature of Divine Worſhip if ſo be thou art not nice about it; God is nice and ſtands upon little things in the matter of his Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Another Note is this; <hi>That there is no priviledges or dignities of man that can ſecure them from Gods ſtroke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eirſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God, he was their Uncle, <hi>Aaron</hi> that great Inſtrument of Gods glory, he was their Father: They were men that were newly conſecrated to the Prieſts Office, they were renowned, men that God put much glory upon; yet if they will venture but to offend God in this little thing, Gods wrath breaks out upon them, and kills them preſently. Let us take heed then of venturing, and do not think that any Services that we have done heretofore can bear us out; If the greateſt cannot be bore out with all their priviledges, how dare we poor worms venture upon the diſpleaſure of God? Thou that art a worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs creature of no uſe at all in the world, dareſt thou provoke this God, when as the Lord is ſo angry againſt men that are of great uſe and ſervice, to let out his wrath upon them ſuddenly? If you ſhould ſee a Prince not ſpare his Favorite, or his Nobles that are about him, but upon one offence that we think is but a little offence, that the Princes anger ſhould be ſo much againſt them as to coſt them their lives; what cauſe is there for poor people to tremble then, when they have done that which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the anger of the Prince? You ſee all outward priviledges and greatneſs will not excuſe from the ſtroke of Gods Juſtice, it ſhould not excuſe from the ſtroke of mans Juſtice: It's true, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, poor people they go to it if they offend, but if great men offend, they eſcape; but it is not ſo with God, for <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were great and renowned men.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Note is, <hi>That the more the dignity of men is, the more is their danger if they look not to it:</hi> And this Note I gather from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104284:12"/>
hence, That <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were the two eldeſt Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and we find in the Scripture that <hi>Eleazer</hi> and <hi>Ithamer</hi> that were the two other ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> they eſcaped and were not thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. Why? Becauſe the two elder ſons had the dignity and priviledg to come and offer the Incenſe, and having greater dignity than the yonger, and not being careful to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they ought to do, the Lord ſmote them, and the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they eſcaped. And ſo many times they that are in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner condition they eſcape, when thoſe that are in a higher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they are ſtruck. Let men that are in higher conditions than others look to themſelves, for their danger is greater: And you that are in a meaner condition, envy not thoſe that are higher, for you may be more ſafe in that mean condition which you are in, than they in theirs.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Note is this, <hi>That the beginnings of things of high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, do meet ſometimes with great difficulties and interruptions.</hi> This Note I gather from hence, That <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were ſtruck at the very beginning of their Prieſt-hood: As now, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe there were a new Office erected in a Common-wealth that concern'd the publick good of the Kingdom, and in the very firſt erecting of the Office there falls out ſome hideous accident that rings throughout the whol Kingdom, as if God from Heaven had done ſomething againſt them in that Office: As now, Suppoſe that the firſt time the Judges ſhould come at the Bench, that God ſhould ſtrike them from Heaven dead at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bench, it would be a mighty matter to darken the glory and honor of that Office. So one would think that it ſhould have been a mighty matter to have darkned the glory and the honor of the Prieſt-hood alwaies: but God ſtands not upon that, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the beginnings of great things are darkned by ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and therefore let us not be offended though we ſee ſome ſad accidents to fall out at the beginning of great things, for though accidents fall out ſadly at firſt, yet God may proſper it afterwards, as he did the Prieſt-hood.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Note is, <hi>That thoſe that enter into publick places. and eſpecially ſuch places as concern the Worſhip of God, they had need have the fear of God much upon them when they firſt enter into thoſe places.</hi> Now this were a very good Point if I were to preach to an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104284:13"/>
of Miniſters. You ſee <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> upon their firſt conſecration the Lord ſmote them for this little miſcarriage as we would think. And that's a Sixth Note which eſpecially concerns Miniſters, and therefore I paſs it over.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Note that we have, and that's very uſeful for us all, <hi>God would have us all to pick out his mind from dark expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though he doth not expreſs His Will fully, and in expreſs terms; yet if there be any thing in his Word whereby we may come to gather the mind of God, God expects that we ſhould gather His mind out of His Word, and if we do not it's at our own peril.</p>
            <p>The mind of God about this ſtrange fire that theſe offered, you will ſay, They were to pick it out: How could they have known that it was Gods mind that they ſhould not offer any fire but that on the Altar?</p>
            <p>They ſhould have reaſoned thus with themſelves, What hath God let fire come down from Heaven upon the Altar, and hath He Commanded that that ſhould be preſerved on the Altar for His ſervice? Surely this muſt be Gods mind then, that we ſhould make uſe of this fire rather than any other fire: God expects that they ſhould have reaſoned thus, but becauſe they did not pick out Gods mind by reaſoning after this manner, therefore the hand of God came out upon them. They offended, and it may be it was through ignorance, but it was at their peril, if they were ignorant of the mind of God when it might be known though it were but darkly revealed, and were to be pickt out from ſeveral places compared together, it was at their peril. It is a Point that we have a great deal of need of: for this is the vain heart of man, That if there be any thing that God would have that is not ſutable to his own ends, he will ſtand wrangling againſt it, and cavelling at it; How doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (will he ſay) can you bring expreſs Scripture for it? Bring me expreſs Scripture in words for to prove it, and then I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it; and ſo ſtands out till you bring ſo many words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that forbids ſuch a thing, or commands ſuch a duty. Now my Brethren if you be of this temper, That you will forbear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor ſet up any thing but what you have directly expreſs
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104284:13"/>
words of Scripture for, you may run at your own peril into woful dangers, into woful ſins: know that God hath ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed a great part of his mind as it is only to be known by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering one thing from another, and by comparing one thing with another. And God expects this from you, That if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination of Scripture that one thing appear more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be his mind and will than another; you are bound to go that way that is more likely. I told you before, That in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Worſhip we muſt have warrant from the Word; but it doth not follow, That we muſt have a direct expreſs warrant in every thing: As it is many times in ſome kind of picture, the great Art, it is in the caſt of the looks; you cannot ſay, it's in the drawing of this line, or the other line, but altogether, it is the caſt of the looks that cauſes the beauty of the Picture: So in the Scripture, you cannot ſay that this one line, or the other line, take it ſingle that proves it, but let them be laid all together and there will be a kind of aſpect of Gods mind, that we may ſee that this is the mind of God rather than the other, and we are bound to go that way.</p>
            <p>Now ſo far <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> might have ſeen, that they ſhould rather have taken fire off the Altar than any other Fire: But they preſum'd becauſe they had not expreſs word, and you ſee it was at their peril. Oh take heed of ſtanding out, and wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt what is required, becauſe you have not expreſs words; the Lord hath laid things ſo, and eſpecially in the New Teſtament, for the ordering of the Church in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as you have not expreſs Command for abundance of things, but ſometimes an example in ſome things, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not a cleer example neither; but compare one thing with another, and that which ſeems to be neereſt the mind of God that ſhould be bond enough to us, to tye us to go according to what the mind of God ſeems moſt probable to be in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and an humble teachable heart will ſoon be convinced, when another man will not.</p>
            <p>We find it cleerly, That ſuch things that are moſt ſutable to mens own ends, a little matter will ſerve the turn to perſwade men to it, though one might argue againſt it: I could eaſily ſhew it, but that I think it not ſo convenient in Pulpits to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104284:14"/>
meddle with ſuch things as thoſe are. Thoſe things I ſay which are ſutable to mens own ends and waies, them they will cloſe withal; but other things that do croſs the fleſh, that are moſt oppoſite to looſneſs, and would bring men moſt under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Chriſt, thoſe things men ſtand out againſt, and they muſt have cleer and expreſs words, expreſs and cleer war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant out of the Word in ſo many terms, or otherwiſe by no means they will not ſo much as yield to it: That's a Point that if God would but ſettle it upon our hearts, might be of very great uſe; A gracious heart will ſee the truth through a very little crevis; But it is mervailous to conſider what a do there is to convince a man before he is humbled, of ſome part of Gods will; and how eaſie is it to convince a man after he is humbled.</p>
            <p>The Eighth Note is this, <hi>That ſinners may meet with ſome judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God that were never threatned in his Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God did never threaten beforehand, and ſay, Whoſoever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſtrange Fire, I will conſume them with Fire from Heaven; But they meet with a judgment that was not threatned; Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this, it may be when we come to ſpeak out of the Word, and ſhew you plainly how God doth threaten ſuch and ſuch ſins, you are afraid then; but know, if thou ventureſt upon waies of ſin, thou mayeſt meet with dreadful judgments exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted that never yet were threatned: Beſides all thoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are threatned in the Book of God, thou maieſt meet with judgments unheard of, unexpected: As God hath mercies beyond what he hath expreſly revealed in his Word, for <hi>never was it heard ſince the beginning of the world what God hath laid up for them that love him:</hi> So God hath judgments beyond what is in his Word. Sometimes when the Miniſters of God do open the threatnings that are in Gods Word, you think that they are terrible: But know that God in the treaſury of his judgments hath more dreadful things than ever yet hath been reveal'd in his Word; and therefore learn to tremble, not only at what is revealed in Gods Word againſt thy ſin, but tremble at what there is in that infinite Juſtice, Power, and Wiſdom of God to find out, and execute upon ſinners; for thou art a ſinner, and eſpecially if thou beeſt a bold and preſumptuous ſinner; thou mayeſt I ſay expect to meet with whatſoever evil an infinite
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104284:14"/>
wiſdom is able to deviſe, and that an infinite power is able to bring upon thee that thou art capable of: Thou committeſt ſuch and ſuch a ſin; perhaps thou doeſt not know of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Judgment that is threatned againſt it; but think thus, I that do provoke God by my ſins, what may I look for? 'Tis more than I know to the contrary, but that whatſoever the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdom of God is able to find out, and what miſery ſoever I am capable of, that the Lord may bring upon me. Conſider of this, and take heed of ſin.</p>
            <p>The Ninth Obſervation is this, <hi>That God is very quick with ſome in the waies of his judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be he may ſpare others for a long time, but concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thee he may ſay, Thou ſhalt not offend twice. If thou wilt venture the firſt act, God may ſtrike thee with death; he did ſo here with <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> for they were but newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, ſo I find it by Interpreters, That they were to be in conſecration for ſeven daies, and this was the firſt day that they came to their place, and in the very firſt act that they did, God did ſmite them: Let us tremble: the Lord is quick towards ſome, he is patient towards others, but do not thou preſume becauſe he is patient to others, he may take thee in the very firſt act of thy ſin, and be quick with thee.</p>
            <p>The Tenth Note is this, <hi>That the holineſs of a duty will never bear a man out in the miſcarriage of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was a holy duty, they were the true Prieſts of God, they came to offer Incenſe to the true God, It was right Incenſe that they offered, there was but this one miſcarriage, They had not the ſame Fire that God would have; now this miſcarriage God comes upon them for, and all the good there was in the Duty it would not bear them out.</p>
            <p>Conſider of this, you that perform many holy duties, take heed of giving way to your ſelves in any miſcarriage, for do not think, that becauſe your duties are very good and holy, that by doing thereof you may venture upon mixture; take heed of mixing any evil, any miſcarriage in any holy thing, though you have performed a thouſand holy duties, yet it will not bear you out in the miſcarriage of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:104284:15"/>
The Eleventh Note is this, <hi>That the Lord is very terrible out of his holy places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Note is the ſame that you have in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 35. <hi>The Lord is terrible out of his holy places:</hi> When we have to deal with God, who can ſtand before this holy God? <hi>our God is a conſuming fire:</hi> The Lord manifeſts himſelf here moſt dreadfully to ſtrike with Fire theſe two Prieſts, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Begin at my Sanctuary,</hi> ſaith God. God is terrible, terrible towards thoſe that ſhall dare to approach unto him, and yet are wicked and ungodly in their approaching, he is terrible to thoſe that are neer unto him, God would have us all to tremble at his preſence.</p>
            <p>In the Twelfth place, <hi>Gods Judgments are often very ſutable to mens ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here they ſinned by <hi>fire,</hi> and they are conſumed by <hi>fire.</hi> They offended by <hi>ſtrange fire,</hi> and God ſtrikes them by a <hi>ſtrange fire.</hi> The Judgments of God are very ſutable to the ſins of men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes. As here by <hi>fire,</hi> ſo another time we find it by <hi>water: Pharaoh</hi> he ſins by drowning the Infants of the people of Iſrael in the <hi>waters,</hi> and God drowns him in the <hi>Sea.</hi> If you will be drowning by water, you ſhall have water enough ſaith God: And ſo here, if you will be medling with ſtrange Fire, you ſhall have ſtrange Fire ſaith God: God doth many times propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Judgments to ſinners that his righteouſneſs might the more appear: thoſe very creatures in which we ſin, many times God makes them, or others of the ſame kind, to be the Executioners of his Wrath. So it was with the Jews, they would ſell Chriſt for 30. pieces of ſilver, and they were ſold 30. of them for a penny afterwards. And ſo the ſtory of <hi>Adoni-bezek</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Judges,</hi> that was ſo cruel in ſuch a way to cut off Thumbs and Toes of Kings, even ſo he was ſerved in the like kind: and it's ordinary for men that are of cruel fiery ſpirits, to meet with cruel fiery ſpirits likewiſe.</p>
            <p>And I would apply it in this particular, You that are ſtout Children to your Parents, if God lets you live, you many times meet with the very ſame in your Children, and when you that are Parents meet with ſtubborn Children, you ſhould reflect, Doth not God come righteouſly upon me? And ſo you that are Servants, you are ſtout to your Maſters, and afterwards
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104284:15"/>
when you come to have Servants they will be ſo to you; and perhaps you were unfaithful to your Governors, afterwards when you come to have ſervants, it's a thouſand to one but they will be ſo to you. Now you ſhould ſtrike your hand upon your heart and ſay, It's juſt with God that it ſhould be ſo, and that He ſhould come upon me in my own kind.</p>
            <p>Another Note is this, <hi>They offered ſtrange fire. Let's take heed all of us, how we bring ſtrange fire into Gods Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bring ſtrange fire into Gods Service, What's that?</p>
            <p>I find diverſe Writers ſpeaking upon this, ſaith <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Luſts, and Covetouſneſs are this ſtrange Fire. That which I would have you conſider of, is this, Above all <hi>ſtrange fire,</hi> take heed of the ſtrange Fire of paſſion and anger; and eſpecially in the Worſhip of God; and at any time when you find your hearts heated and fired with Anger, when you are about to worſhip God, remember this Scripture, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu were conſumed by God, with fire from God, for coming into Gods preſence with ſtrange fire:</hi> Now, O Lord, how often have we come into thy preſence with ſtrange Fire! Perhaps your hearts have been burning hot with paſſion when you have been coming into Gods preſence: You are to pray with fervency, for ſo the Scripture ſaith: we are indeed to be heat in prayer, by the holy Ghoſt in our hearts, but certainly not to come with the fire of paſſion and anger: <hi>Lift up your hands without wrath and doubting.</hi> If you have been paſſionate, and your hearts have been heat that way, be ſure you get your hearts cold before you go to Prayer. And ſo when you come to hear the Word, if your hearts have been heat with paſſion, be ſure you get them cold before you come to hear the Word: <hi>Receive with meekneſs the ingrafted Word that may ſave your ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo when you come to the Lords Supper, Take heed of coming with wrath and malice, for then you come but to offer ſtrange Fire. It is a ſpecial Conſideration for Miniſters that come to preach, they ſhould take heed of bringing <hi>ſtrange fire</hi> into ther Pulpits; that is, of venting their own paſſions; That hath been ever a rule, that I have been convinced of ſince I knew any thing of Preaching, That that man that is appointed to reveal Gods wrath, had need to conceal his own wrath: that's
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104284:16"/>
certainly a rule for all Preachers, for the Lord ſends his Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to make known his wrath againſt mens ſins; but now, the more they make known his wrath, the more they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their own; and ſo by that means when they come in the openeſt way to manifeſt Gods wrath, the more their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching would be accepted. Now it's true, a carnal heart would be ready to think, That when a Preacher ſpeaks out of true zeal to God, he will be ready to ſay, That he hath aiming at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Take heed of that, I beleeve you have had but little oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſuch a temptation in this place: but however this I know, it is the duty of the Miniſters of God to be ſure to bring nothing but the Fire of the Spirit of God, the Fire that they have from the Alter; their tongues being touch'd with one of theſe Coals, and not that they ſhould come with their own paſſions to further the Righteouſneſs of God, no, <hi>The wrath of man doth not accompliſh the Righteouſneſs of God.</hi> There are ſome other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which being laid down, we ſhall come to the Three main Points.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE began theſe words the laſt day, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed the ſcope of them, and opened the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, and ſpake of divers Notes of Obſervation that we gathered from this ſtory of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> and of Gods dealing with them. From the general ſtory of it, there were many Points of notable Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that were drawn from thence: I'le ad ſome few now, and ſo come to the main Doctrinal Point in the Text.</p>
            <p>A further Note of Obſervation is this, <hi>That many times even the dear Saints of God do meet with very ſore and grevous offlictions in their Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:104284:16"/>
That the moſt eminent Saints of God are not freed from very grievous afflictions even in their Children; It was one of the foreſt afflictions that almoſt ever any Saint of God met withal in his Children; this affliction of <hi>Aaron</hi> at this time, That two of his Sons, and (as I told you the laſt day) renowned men in Iſrael, newly conſecrated to the Office of Prieſthood, that the very firſt day they came to offer in their Office, they were ſtruck before all the people with Fire from Heaven, and were conſumed: Oh what a ſad affliction was it to <hi>Aaron</hi> their Father, when he ſaw his Sons in ſuch a manner deſtroyed by God Himſelf! Conſider of this, you that have Children, and are ready to murmur and complain of every little affliction that is upon you in reſpect of your Children: If ſo be that your Children be but a little ſick, or there be any miſcarriage of them, you think it is a heavy hand of God; But eſpecially if God take away your Children by death, then you mourn and will not be comforted: Yea, but though God have taken away your Children by death, yea, perhaps it may be by a violent death, as being drowned, &amp;c. yet they have not been ſtrucken with Fire from Heaven by God, and they have not been of ſuch publick uſe. Theſe here were renowned men, and taken away in their very ſin too; your Children which have gone upon their lawful imployments, and God hath taken away their lives, there is no ſuch cauſe of murmuring here; but when God takes away Children in their ſins, and in ſuch a way as by Fire from Heaven; thus God took away <hi>Aarons</hi> Children, and he was as dear to God as you are: And yet thus God deals with his Saints, with <hi>Aaron</hi> in regard of his Children, and with his elder Children, and with two of them together. This Example may be enough to ſtill and quiet the hearts of men and women that are afflicted in reſpect of any calamity that befals their Children. You ſee what a hand of God is againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Children of <hi>Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A further Note is this <hi>That Gods Judgments we ſee ſometimes, though the effect of them be viſible, yet they come in an inviſible way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For you ſhal find if you reade on in this ſtory, That they were ſmote with fire from Heaven, but it did not appear what fire, for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104284:17"/>
it did not ſo much as conſume their cloathes, not their bodies, but went through all and ſtruck them dead, and no body could tell how. Gods judgments do come in a way that is inviſible: if it had been in a viſible flame of fire, all would have ſeen it, and it would have burnt their cloaths, or their bodies: but you ſhall find in the 5. verſe, That they were carried away from the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in their cloaths, they were not burnt.</p>
            <p>Another Note is this, <hi>That though the lives of men be dear and precious to God yet they are not ſo precious as his Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Glory of his Name is a thouſand thouſand times more dear unto God than the lives of thouſand thouſands of People; the lives of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> muſt go, that God may be Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: If it comes ſo in the way (as I may ſo ſay) the lives of men, and the Sanctifying of Gods Name, the Glory of God muſt paſs on, and muſt have its courſe let the lives of men go which way they will.</p>
            <p>We think much to have the lives of men taken away; but if we know what the Glory of God meant, and what infinite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there is that God ſhould be glorified, we would not think it much that the lives of never ſo many men ſhould go for the Glory of God. 'Tis mercy that our lives have not gone many times for Gods Glory; How often might God have glorified Himſelf in taking away our lives? We have cauſe to bleſs Him, that our lives have been preſerved ſo long as they have.</p>
            <p>Again Note, <hi>That the neerer any men are unto God, the more they had need take heed that they glorifie Him, for they muſt expect to be ſpared the leſs if they ſin againſt Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> the Prieſts of God, and they came neer to God, yet by their tranſgreſſion; though I told you, We do not find in any place of Scripture directly in words, that this Fire is forbidden, but they ſhould have gathered Gods mind by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, And therefore by the way I only Note. That we muſt not think to urge upon men in all things ſtrict commands in very words, but if it be commanded ſo as we may draw it by any conſequence, it's a command; as now here for the Negative, they had not a Negative prohibition in words, yet they had it by Conſequence: So for the Affirmative, though we have not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104284:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Affirmative in expreſs words, yet if we may have it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, it is an Affirmative as well as the Negative, when we have it by conſequence. But now the Note of Obſervation is, <hi>That the neerer any comes to God, if they ſin againſt Him, they muſt not expect to be ſpared.</hi> Do not think that God will ſpare you the more becauſe you are Profeſſors of Religion, or becauſe you do often worſhip him: I ſuppoſe you that are acquainted with Scripture, know that place in <hi>Amos,</hi> 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the Earth: therefore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Note is this, <hi>That when a judgment is exemplary, then we ſhould have recourſe to the Word of God, to ſee how God doth make his Word good in that judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Moſes</hi> doth, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath ſaid.</hi> Do you ſee any remarkable hand of God in the execution of a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon one, have recourſe to Gods Word, and preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to think this, What is there in Gods Word againſt that ſin that this man hath been guilty of? If you ſee a judgment of God upon a Drunkard, remember the threats in the Word of God againſt Drunkenneſs, and ſo the judgments of God upon unclean Perſons, Swearers, Sabbath-breakers, Lyars, or any Prophane, and ungodly perſons, have recourſe to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God threatned in the Word againſt ſuch: and ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concerning Scorners and Oppoſers of Religion, remember what is ſaid in the Word of God againſt ſuch, and ſo learn to ſanctifie Gods Name: We might have mentioned ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular threats of God againſt particular ſinners for the helping of you, that when you ſee exemplary judgments: to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Word of God: But we let that paſs.</p>
            <p>A further Note from this ſtory is this, <hi>That the great honor that God intends to his Name, It is, the making of his Name Holy. I wil be Sanctified in them that draw nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould ſay in Gods Name, I muſt, and will have glory from the people, And how? By making my Name appear to be <hi>Holy,</hi> this is the glory that I ſtand upon above all other things, that my <hi>Name</hi> may appear to be <hi>Holy,</hi> that I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a <hi>Holy God.</hi> I beſeech you Brethren conſider of this,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104284:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God ſtands upon nothing more than to appear to all the world to be a Holy God, there's the glory of Gods Name in an eminent way, God doth not ſo much ſtand upon this to appear to be a <hi>ſtrong</hi> God, to appear to be a <hi>powerful</hi> God, to be a God of <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, long ſuffering,</hi> God doth not ſo much ſtand to be an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient God, though theſe Attributes are dear to God, but that he may appear to be a <hi>Holy</hi> God: that he ſtands upon. Whatever glory of the Name of God, that God ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have ecclipſed in the world for a while, yet he is reſolved he will have the glory of his Holineſs above all things: and therefore the Angels when they are celebrating the glory of God, they do not ſay, Lord Almighty, Almighty, Almighty, or Lord, Omniſcient, Omniſcient, Omniſcient; but <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy:</hi> Thoſe three together, the Holineſs of God, therein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the glory of God above all: God ſtands upon it that he will appear to be a Holy God.</p>
            <p>Oh that thoſe who profeſs themſelves to be the Servants of God, that they would eſpecially endeavor to hold forth Gods Holineſs; you that are neer to God, you that hope you are Gods Children, and make profeſſion of his Name, labor you to hold forth the glory of his Holineſs above all things, in your holy lives and Converſations: for God ſtands upon this, To have his Name to be Sanctified, <hi>I will be Sanctified,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>and I will be glorified,</hi> ſo he doth interpret the glory of his Name by being Sanctified. As if God ſhould ſay, That's the glory that I look for, That my Name may be extolled as Holy: And therefore the very firſt Petition that Chriſt teaches us to pray in the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> it is, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> which is all one with this, <hi>Sanctified be thy Name;</hi> Oh let the Name of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be holy in the World: that's another Note, that theſe two are joyned together, <hi>I'le be Sanctified in thoſe that draw nigh me, and I will be glorifyed before the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again obſerve, <hi>That it is the part of true friendſhip, to help friends in their diſtreſſes, and ſeek to comfort them from the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though we our ſelves be in afflictions, yet we ſhould ſeek to comfort our friends that are in greater afflictions, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them by the Word, for ſo did <hi>Moſes: Moſes</hi> comes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>Aaron,</hi> and applies the Word, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:104284:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>ſaid, I will be Sanctified.</hi> Now mark, no queſtion <hi>Moſes</hi> was afflicted upon this heavy hand of God, for he was their Uncle; but though it was heavy upon the Uncle, yet it was heavier up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Father, and therefore though <hi>Moſes</hi> was troubled, yet he knew that <hi>Aaron</hi> was more troubled, and therefore he goes to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and ſeeks to comfort him, and he makes uſe of this Word in his comforting of him. Learn this then, to go and comfort your Brethren, for <hi>Aaron</hi> was <hi>Moſes</hi> brother; Go and comfort them in their afflictions, and think not becauſe that you have ſome afflictions upon you, that therefore you ſhould not be a comfort to your brethren: their affliction is greater than yours, and when you come to comfort them, come not in a meer carnal way, and ſay, Brother you muſt be content: but you muſt come and apply ſomewhat of the Word of God to comfort them, and ſay, <hi>This is that which the Lord hath ſpoke;</hi> and to that end you ſhould labor to be exerciſed in the Word of God, that ſo you may be able to go to your brethren and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them in any affliction; for there is no particular affliction, but there is ſome Word of God that is ſutable to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affliction, and thoſe who are well exerciſed in the Word of God, they can apply ſome word to every affliction: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is an excellent friend, and ſuch a friend is worth his weight in gold, that can come to another friend in any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and evermore hath ſomewhat of the Word of God to apply to that affliction.</p>
            <p>The laſt Obſervation is this, <hi>That</hi> Aaron <hi>held his peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence we may Note, <hi>That there is no ſuch way to quiet a gracious heart under any afflictions in the world, as that God will fetch out His Honor by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is grievous to me, but God fetches out His Glory, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor by it. The applying of the Word, and the conſideration that God hath his way to fetch out his glory in our afflictions, is the only way to quiet a gracious heart. All theſe Points might take up a a great deal of time, but I will let them paſs, and come to the main Point of all, <hi>I will be Sanctified in thoſe that come nigh me.</hi> There are theſe Three Points in theſe words.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That in the Worſhip of God, men and women draw nigh to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:104284:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Secondly, <hi>That we ought to Sanctifie Gods Name in drawing nigh to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That if we do not Sanctifie it, God will Sanctifie his own Name upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That in Worſhiping of God, there is a drawing nigh to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why, is not God in every place?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes certainly, we can never be in any place but we are nigh to God, God ſtands by us, and looks upon us: It is not only when you are Worſhiping of God that you are nigh Him, but when you ſin againſt Him, when thou art ſwearing, prophaning His Name, His Day, God ſtands and looks upon thee, thou art nigh Him: And it may be ſaid or written upon every place, what was ſaid of the City, in the laſt words of the Propheſie of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. 35. <hi>The name of the City was</hi> Jehovah Shamma, that is, <hi>The Lord is there,</hi> the Lord Jehovah He is there, He is preſent in this place: Oh that you would remember when you are in any place, that the Name of that place is <hi>Jehovah Shamma,</hi> The Lord is there, <hi>In him we live, we move, and have our being,</hi> therfore we are alwaies nigh him: yea, but though we are alwaies nigh God in regard of that eſſential preſence of his, yet there is a more peculiar and ſpecial drawing nigh to God in the duties of his Worſhip, and that the Scripture ſeems to hold forth unto you. Firſt I'le ſhew you how the Scripture holds it forth, and then in what reſpect the Creature may be ſaid to draw nigh to God in holy duties of Worſhip; for ſo it was here, they were coming to offer Incenſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we do draw nigh to God in holy duties, ſee <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Draw nigh to God</hi> (ſo that you may be neerer God than you were) that is, by holy ſervices, and holy duties; and hence it is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 2. <hi>Let us come before his preſence with thanks giving;</hi> ſo that there is a more peculiar coming before Gods preſence when we come to worſhip him than at other times: And Verſ. 6. <hi>O come let us Worſhip and how down, let us kneel before the Lord our maker.</hi> So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. 2. <hi>Let us come before his preſence with ſinging.</hi> for that's one part of the Worſhip of God. But the Scripture is plain, that there is a ſpecial coming before God when we are coming
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104284:19"/>
to Worſhip him, and in this reſpect the Servants of God in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. 14. are ſaid to be <hi>a people neer to God.</hi> It is a very remarkable expreſſion, and ſets forth much the honor of the Saints of God: There's the commendation of the excellent eſtate of the Saints. <hi>He alſo exalteth the horn of his people, the praiſe of all his Saints, even the children of Iſrael, a people neer unto him.</hi> The Saints of God, the Children of Iſrael, the Church of God are ſaid to be <hi>a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple neer to God;</hi> Why neer him? Becauſe that they Worſhip God, they are much exerciſed in the Worſhip of God. This is one reſpect though there may be divers others mentioned, yet in reſpect of their coming ſo much before God in his Worſhip, therefore they are neer God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Neer him! Why, in what reſpects may a man be ſaid to draw nigh to God when he Worſhips him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I Anſwer, There are three reſpects in which a man when he is Worſhiping God may be ſaid to <hi>draw nigh to God:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe when we come to Worſhip God, we come to tender up that homage and ſervice unto him, that is due from us as Creatures to the infinite Creator; that's the very end of Worſhip. If you would know what it is to Worſhip God, it is this:</p>
            <p>You come to tender up that homage and reſpect that is due from the Creature to the Creator. Now when a Subject comes to tender up his homage to his Prince, he comes towards him, when he doth it immediately: So we have none to tender it up by but Jeſus Chriſt, and when we tender it up we muſt come our ſelves too, for Chriſt doth nor take our ſervice and tender it up to God and we be abſent, but we muſt come with Chriſt, and Chriſt takes us by the hand and ſo tenders it up to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while we are in preſence, ſo that we are ſaid to come nigh to God in that reſpect, becauſe of the <hi>immediate</hi> tendering up of that Worſhip of ours to God; I call it immediate in reſpect of any creature: But in reſpect of Chriſt, indeed he is a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to do it, but yet he doth it in a ſpiritual way, and we have to do with none but God through Jeſus Chriſt in the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of our Worſhip to him: We may make uſe of an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution that God hath appointed, but we do not tender up our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104284:20"/>
Worſhip to God through that creature, but in the uſe of that creature we do come to God, and our ſouls are to tender up that reſpect we owe to God immediatly. therefore in <hi>levit.</hi> 21. 21. it is ſaid of the Prieſts in their Sacrifices, when they were to come to Worſhip God, <hi>No man that hath a blemiſh of the ſeed of</hi> Aaron <hi>the Prieſt ſhall come nigh to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire.</hi> So that when any come to offer any offerings of the Lord made by Fire, it appears he came nigh to God; he came to bring a Preſent to God, therefore he comes nigh. So when we come to offer our Spiritual ſacrifices unto God, we come nigh to God to offer, it's the offering of a ſacrifice to God. And that's the firſt thing, becauſe the creature comes to bring a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to God, therefore he is ſaid to <hi>draw nigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly, The ſoul is ſaid to <hi>draw nigh</hi> to God in holy duties, becauſe it doth preſent its ſelf before God in thoſe waies through which God doth uſe to communicate his choice, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, moſt excellent and glorious mercies to his people; I ſay, when we come to Worſhip God, we come to ſet our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in thoſe waies that God doth uſe to communicate the choice, moſt excellent and glorious rich mercies that he hath to communicate to his creature.</p>
            <p>When we have to deal with creatures, as meat and drink, and our outward buſineſſes we have to do with God in them; but when we come to worſhip God, we come to preſent our ſelves before him in thoſe things that he doth uſe to let out himſelf through in a more ſpecial and glorious manner to the ſouls of his people. What's the reaſon why Heaven is ſaid to be the preſence of God, and why thoſe that are in Heaven are ſaid to live with God? There they behold the face of God and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in a ſpecial manner, therefore when Chriſt teacheth us to pray, he teacheth us to look up to Heaven and to ſay, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Now certainly the eſſential pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is on Earth as truly and really as in Heaven, and God is not ſo as to have one part in one place, and another in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but All God is in every place, but the reaſon why God is ſaid to be in Heaven, it is becauſe the Lord makes known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there in a more glorious manner than in any other place, and therefore Heaven is the preſence of God in a more ſpecial
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104284:20"/>
way. Now then if the communication of God unto a creature be enough to make the preſence of God more ſpecial, if this be enough to make a creature to live with God, and to be before his face, becauſe they are there where God doth moſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate himſelf, then certainly when we come to worſhip God, we come to be neer God, and be with God, becauſe the duties of his Worſhip are thoſe means that the Lord hath appointed for the letting out of himſelf in the glory of his goodneſs and mercy to his people: You may expect other manner of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of God goodneſs through the duties of his Worſhip than in any other way: And that's the ſecond reſpect wherein you may be ſaid to <hi>draw nigh to God</hi> in holy duties.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You may be ſaid to <hi>draw nigh to God,</hi> becauſe then we ſhould (and if we worſhip God as we ought, we do) act our faith and humility, and all the graces of the Spirit; We do act them, as it were, upon God, when we come to worſhip him: That's required in every duty of worſhip, that you ſhould ſtir up the faculties of your ſouls, and all the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and you ſhould act them upon God when you are worſhiping of him. 'Tis not enough to come with grace when you come to worſhip God, but there muſt be an acting of that grace upon God.</p>
            <p>And ſo we find in Scripture, that the acting of grace upon God, it is a <hi>drawing neer to him,</hi> therefore in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. the Lord complains there, <hi>This people draws neer to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me:</hi> as if God ſhould ſay, Indeed they come and ſpeak to me, and therefore they think they <hi>draw nigh to me,</hi> but I expect that their hearts ſhould be acting upon me, that's the meaning. And in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 2. God complains there of his people that they did not <hi>draw neer to him</hi> as they ſhould: And it appears plainly, it was from hence, that their graces did not act ſo upon God as they ought, <hi>She obeyed not the voice: ſhe received not correction: ſhe truſted not in the Lord: ſhe drew not neer to her God.</hi> So that acting faith upon God is a drawing nigh to God, and ſo acting any grace upon God is a drawing nigh to God. Now when is there a time for the acting of our graces upon God, ſo as when we come to worſhip God? And therefore in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 94. 7. the Lord complains there, <hi>That no man did ſtir up</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:104284:21"/>
               <hi>himſelf to take hold on him.</hi> When we come to Worſhip God we ſhould ſtir up our ſelves to take hold of God. And thus you ſee in what reſpects the Soul may be ſaid <hi>to draw nigh to God</hi> when it comes to Worſhip him.</p>
            <p>Now for the Aplication of this point, and it is in divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. The Firſt is this.</p>
            <p>Hence learn what you do when you come to Worſhip God and conſider of it every time you come to perform any act of Worſhip. Truly this one thing would be of marveilons uſe, and it would help forward to the next point of <hi>Sanctifying of Gods Name.</hi> This you are all convinced of, That it is your duty to Worſhip God; when you Pray, you come to Worſhip God, when you come to hear his Word you come to worſhip him, and when you receive the Sacrament you Worſhip him. Now if I ſhould come from one end of the Congregation to the other, and ask every one of you this Queſtion, It is your duty to Worſhip God, Is it not? Yes, that you will all be ready to anſwer. And what do you do when you Worſhip God? I fear that this Second Queſtion would gravel many. You will ſay, We muſt pray to God, and ſerve him, and hear his Word, and go to the Communion: yea, but what do your Souls do in this work of worſhiping of God? This ſhould be the anſwer, and ſo you ſhould think with your ſelves, and charge this upon your own hearts, I am now going to worſhip God, either in Prayer, Word, or Sacrament, I am now going to tender up that homage that is due from a creature to the infinit Creator, ſo that I muſt ſo pray, as I muſt manifeſt that high reſpect that I owe to God as my Creator; but that I ſhall ſpeak to more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terword: only now remember this, That you do profeſs every time you go to Prayer, That you go to tender up that homage that you owe unto God, and ſo every time you come to hear the Word, there is a profeſſion that you come to tender up that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and homage that you owe to the infinite God: And ſo likewiſe when you come to receive the Sacrament. Now when we come to offer a preſent to men, we know how we prepare, and with what ſutable preſence we deſire to offer: but of that afterward when we come to ſpeak of <hi>Sanctifying Gods Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Secondly, Remember, when I come to Worſhip God, I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104284:21"/>
come to ſet my ſelf before the Lord in thoſe ways that God doth let out the choice of His Mercies to his people in; I have many mercies from God in the enjoyment of the creature, but when I come to worſhip Him, I expect the communication of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in another way than through any creature in the world. The duties of his Worſhip are the chief channels that God doth let out the choiceſt of His Mercies to the hearts of His people through, and now I am going to worſhip Him, I am going to preſent my ſelf before God. Indeed there is a little glimmering of the light of God through other Creatures to me, but the glorious Beams of the light of God is through the duties of His Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And then Thirdly, I am now going to act my Soul upon God, ſo that if I have any abilities to cloſe with God, to act my ſoul upon him, it muſt be put forth now at this time: I am indeed at all times to labor to enjoy Communion with God, when I ſee the Creatures, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, to labor to lift up my heart to God, and when I ſee the glory of God in the Sea, and for my meat and drink I am to bleſs God, and to acknowledg God in all, but when I come to worſhip God, then all the ſtrength of my ſoul is to be acted upon God in a more ſpecial manner; I muſt then above all labor to ſtir up whatſoever I have in my ſoul to act upon God: this is now to worſhip God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If to worſhip God, be to draw nigh to God, hence we ſee the reaſons why guilty conſciences have little mind to the duties of Gods Worſhip. When a man or woman hath given liberty to any licentious way, and ſinned againſt their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if they have any light in their conſciences, it is one of the tediouſeſt things in the world to come to the duties of Gods Worſhip; they had rather do any thing than come to holy Duties, as to Prayer, and eſpecially to ſecret Prayer. A man or woman that hath an enlightned conſcience, and is under the guilt of ſin, the coming to God in holy duties, is a very grievous burden to them: Why? Here's the Reaſon, Becauſe to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, is to <hi>draw to God,</hi> and the guilt that is upon them hath made the preſence of God terrible to them, and therefore they had rather go into their company, and be merry, eat, drink,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104284:22"/>
ſport, or any thing rather than to come into Gods preſence. We know how it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> when God appeared in the Garden and called to him, he ran to hide himſelf; Why? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had guiltineſs upon him. Oh! the evil that the guilt of ſin brings upon the ſoul, it makes the preſence of God terrible. The preſence of God it ſhould be more comfortable to us, than our lives; but our ſin makes Gods preſence grievous and terrible. A Child ſometimes when it hath offended the Father, and is conſcious to its ſelf of the offence that it hath given the Father, it had rather be in the Kitchin among the Servants, than to come into the Hall, or Parlor, where the Father is, becauſe it hath offended him. And ſo it is with a guilty conſcience when it is conſcious to its ſelf of ſome haunt of evil that it hath given it ſelf unto, it hath no mind at all of coming into the preſence of the Father, but hangs off. My Brethren, the very preſence of God in the Communion of his Saints is terrible to a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the very looking upon a godly man is terrible to a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſcience: When as thou haſt been abroad, and been looſe and wicked in thy waies, I appeal to thy conſcience, when thou comeſt into the preſence of ſome holy, gracious man or woman that lives cloſe with God, Doth it not daunt thee? Now is the preſence of God in the very faces of his Saints, terrible to a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſcience: how terrible is the preſence of God in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances then? Indeed thoſe men and women, whoſe conſciences are not enlightened, but are ignorant and ſottiſh, they can ſin againſt God, and go into his preſence without any trouble; you ſhall have men ſwear, and be drunk over night, and come to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> the next day; What's the reaſon? Becauſe there is no light ſn their conſciences, their conſciences are in darkneſs, they are beſotted in their ſin; but I ſpeak now of one who hath an enlightened conſcience, the preſence of God is terrible to ſuch an one.</p>
            <p>A Third Uſe is this, Here's the reaſon why Hypocrites do meet with ſuch vengeance from God as they do. I confeſs we ſhall meet with this more eſpecially afterwards, only by the way take notice of it, Hypocrites above all men may expect the ſevereſt judgments of God upon them, becauſe they come ſo nigh God, for they come often to the Duties of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104284:22"/>
now they that will come ſo nigh Gods preſence, and come with baſe and ungodly hearts, to cloak their villany, of all in the world they muſt expect to have the ſevere vengeance of God let down upon them; they that ſtand nigheſt the bullet muſt expect to have the ſtrength of it to be the more upon them; ſo when the wrath of God proceeds out upon ſinners, wicked men that ſtand nigheſt Him, they have the greateſt ſtroke of Gods wrath: But of that more when I come to the Third Point, <hi>That God will be Sanctified in thoſe that draw nigh Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fourth Uſe is this, <hi>If to Worſhip God, be to draw nigh Him, then to neglect Gods Worſhip, is to depart from Him;</hi> that muſt needs follow. And this is a dreadful thing, it is the Sentence that ſhall be at the laſt day of Judgment, <hi>Depart from me.</hi> Thou now art willing to depart from God, Oh conſider of this you that neglect Worſhip, the Worſhip of God in your Families, and in your Cloſets, and in the Congregation, in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Saints, thou haſt little minded or regarded the Worſhip of God (it may be) all thy daies, what haſt thou been doing all this while? thou haſt been departing from God all this while, and when thy conſcience ſhall be but enlightned, and awakened to ſee how far thou art from God, how terrible will it be to thee; Remember this, you that have no mind to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Worſhip of God, but love the Commiſſion of ſin, you neglect Gods Worſhip, you were wont to worſhip him in a conſtant way in your cloſets, and families, but now you grow more looſe, and ſo you grow more dead every day than other, you go off from God more and more. Surely there can be no good to neglect Gods Worſhip. And thoſe that are loth to Worſhip God, becauſe they cannot worſhip him as they ought; from this Point it appears plainly, That there can be no good gotten by neglecting Gods Worſhip, for it is departing from God, whatſoever plea there may be by any temptation to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Gods Worſhip certainly there is danger in it and therefore never liſten to any ſuch temptation as ſhall draw your hearts from the duties of Gods Worſhip. There are a generation of wantons in theſe times, that make little matter of continuing the duties of Gods Worſhip, they were wont conſtantly to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, and to attend upon the Word, but now it is nothing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104284:23"/>
to them, and they are even ready to thank God for it that they make not ſuch conſcience as they were wont to do in the duties of the Worſhip of God, It may be they will ſay, That hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome ſlaviſh terror did carry them on in the duties of Gods Worſhip more than the underſtanding of the freeneſs of the grace of God would admit of: but ſhall the underſtanding of the freedom of the grace of God carry thee on leſs than thy ſlaviſh terror did? Oh blind and wanton ſpirit that knoweſt not the waies of God, nor the freeneſs of the grace of God, nor the riches of it! Oh what a diſhonor art thou to Jeſus Chriſt, and to the freeneſs of his grace, that thou canſt go up and down from day to day and never Worſhip God! Did Jeſus Chriſt come into the world for that end for to cauſe thee to depart more from God? 'Tis plain out of the Word, That the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods Worſhip are thoſe duties whereby the ſoul comes to draw nigh to God: And I beſeech you Brethren, obſerve theſe men, whether there be that Holineſe in their lives, that Spiritualneſs as there was wont to be? No, you ſhall find them by degrees to grow looſe, yea, run ſometimes into groſs ſins, grow many times to lying and deceiving, and to drunkenneſs and company-keeping: yea, to worſe things by degrees: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they are at firſt ready to ſay, Is thy Servant a dead Dog that I ſhould do this? But by departing from God they grow dead to holy duties: we find it by experience, That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Religion have not that Holineſs, Heavenlineſs, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualneſs as they were wont to have in former times; and no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, for now they keep not ſo nigh to God as they were wont. You that are Sea-men and Travellers, ſometimes you are neer the Sun, and then you are hot, but the further off the Sun you go, you grow to be colder and colder: And ſo thoſe that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Worſhip of God they go from warm Sun, they go from the light of Gods Countenance, and from the preſence of God, and ſo they grow cold and chill, and by degrees they grow to prophaneſs, and it is to be feared that many of them will grow to meer Athieſm.</p>
            <p>Another Uſe is this, An Uſe of Exhortation, that we would be encouraged to worſhip God, and to be much in the Worſhip of God. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Let us draw neer</hi> (ſaith the Text) Who
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104284:23"/>
would not draw neer to God? Oh what a good thing is it to be in the preſence of God: Is not the Lord the fountain of thy life? Is it not a ſweet thing to be in his preſence? We think it a ſweet thing to be in the preſence of godly men; Oh that we might alwaies, live with ſuch men, and be nigh them! That Martyr Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> rejoyced in this, That ever he came into priſon to be acquainted with that Angel of God, holy Maſter <hi>Bradford:</hi> and as I remember ſome among the Heathens that profeſt they would rather be in priſon with <hi>Cato,</hi> than be in the greateſt glory with ſome other. It is a bleſſed thing to be in the preſence of God, to be with him that is the God of our lives, and the fountain of all good; let us draw nigh to God often, let us know that it is a mercy that we may draw nigh to God; we might have been baniſhed from the preſence of the Lord long e're this time.</p>
            <p>This is that that the happineſs of the glorious Church is ſet out by, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>They ſhall ſee his face, and his Name ſhall be in their foreheads.</hi> This is the Priviledg of the Church. And that it is ſuch a bleſſing to draw nigh to God, you may ſee it by that in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>For through him, we both have an acceſs by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit unto the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Through Him]</hi> Through Chriſt we have acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father; and now (ſaith he) <hi>Ye that were ſtrangers and forreigners, are made fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God.</hi> And verſ. 13. <hi>But now by Jeſus Chriſt, ye who ſomtimes were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt,</hi> and you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs through Chriſt. So, our coming nigh to God is ſuch a priviledg as coſt the Blood of Chriſt; And will not you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it? You were far off in your natural condition, but now you are nigh through his Blood. Lay but this Text warm to your hearts this morning, That I that was far off, am made nigh by the Blood of Chriſt, made nigh to God; it will be a means for ever to draw your hearts to all thoſe waies whereby you may draw neereſt to God.</p>
            <p>And by drawing nigh to God often, you will come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your graces abundantly: your graces, how wil they act? the preſence of God wil draw forth the acts of grace, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the fire draws forth our heat, ſo the preſence of God will draw forth our graces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:104284:24"/>
And by this means we come to live moſt holy lives. We reade of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was upon the mountain fourty daies with God, and when he came down his face did ſo ſhine, that the people were not able to bear it; What's the reaſon? it was from hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſo nigh to God: Would you have your faces to ſhine in a holy converſation before men? converſe much with God, be often with God, be nigh to him, and that will make you ſhine as lights in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We find it ſo with ſome that converſe much with God, there is a ſhine upon their very countenances.</p>
            <p>And further, it is a ſpecial ſign of our adoption to love, to be nigh to God. What ſhould a Child love moſt but to be in the preſence of his Father? Would you know whether you have received the Spirit of aboption yea or no? I can hardly give you any one ſign ſo cleer as this, For to love to go into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: As <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I was glad when they ſaid, Come, and let us go up unto the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> You ſhal have many that love to be in Gods preſence, ſo as they think on it over-night, and long for the time till it comes; I never am better than when I am with God, me thinks when I get into Gods preſence, either in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer or any duty of Gods Worſhip, I find my heart warmed and quickned, &amp;c. They are ready to ſay with <hi>Peter,</hi> Maſter, it is good being here.</p>
            <p>And that's another thing, It is that which will put us in mind of the life of Heaven, it is the only thing in Heaven to be in the preſence of God. Why, the more thou art nigh God in the Duties of Worſhip, the more thou art in Heaven, and doeſt not thou pray, That the Will of God may be done in Earth as in Heaven? Now the Saints and Angels are alwaies before God Worſhiping of Him; then be as much as thou canſt in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, If thou wouldeſt be in Heaven, be there: Many of the Saints they find it ſo: It is not ſo with carnal hearts, they are weary preſently, when they are in Prayer, or hearing the Word, it is not ſo to them: yea, that's becauſe thou haſt not the preſence of God, as in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. what wearineſs is there? Thou canſt be a gaming till one or two a clock at night, and though thou ſhouldeſt loſe thy ſupper, or the work of thy family, it is not tedious to thee to be exerciſed in thoſe things that pleaſeth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104284:24"/>
the fleſh; but when thou comeſt to worſhip God, how quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly art thou tir'd? now what wilt thou do in Heaven where there is nothing elſe done to all eternity but worſhiping of God;</p>
            <p>And then it muſt needs be delightful to God that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt come nigh him: There is nothing in the world more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to God than to have His Saints come into His preſence. What doth a Father more delight in than to have his Children about him? Never did any Father or Mother love to have their Children by them, ſo as God loves to have His Children come nigh Him, and be often with him. And the truth is, one great reaſon that God ſuffers you to fall into affliction ſo much, is, That you may come runing to him: How doth the child come running to the Father or Mother when it is afraid? why, the Lord is willing to permit men to do you wrong that you may run to him, that he might have more of your preſence: Thou that art ſuch a poor creature, yet thou heareſt this day that there is nothing in the world that God takes more pleaſure in (next to the preſence of his own Son Jeſus Chriſt, and his Saints and Angels that he hath with him in Heaven) than to have his Saints come nigh him, to have them to be alwaies under his wing.</p>
            <p>And then by coming often into Gods preſence in His worſhip there will grow a ſweet and bleſſed familiarity between God and thy ſoul, for thou wilt be ſpeaking to God, and God will be ſpeaking to thee too: We know many times that dear friends who are very neerly linkt together, yet if they be long abſent one from another there grows a ſtrangeneſs, and ſo by degrees their friendſhip is deaded; but now when they are together e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, and there is an intercourſe of love and friendſhip, then their friendſhip is kept active and quick, but now if they be abſent long; Indeed if they be abſent in another Country when they cannot come together, that they are ſure it is not through any neglect, then it will not damp their friendſhip; but when they are neer and come not one to another, then they think it is out of neglect, and ſo they grow ſtrange. So it is with the ſoul, if there were no poſſibility of coming into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, then it would not hinder the ſweetneſs of the love of God to us. But now when we have thoſe duties of worſhip wherein
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104284:25"/>
we may draw nigh to God, if we neglect them, our familiarity with God will quickly be loſt, <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf with God and be at peace.</hi> God is willing to be acquainted with his ſervants, the Lord loves to be familiar with the pooreſt of his Saints, and wilt not thou maintain that ſweet familiarity with God? Theſe two benefits will fallow upon thy familiarity with God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Thoſe that are moſt familiar with God they are moſt potent with God; As now, a ſtranger cannot prevail in any Petition ſo as a familiar friend can. Thus my brethren, when ſtrangers come into Gods preſence, God doth not ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them: but when his familiars come into his preſence, the Saints of God that keep cloſe with him in conſtant communion and converſe in the duties of his Worſhip, God doth take them as His familiar friends, and they will prevail much with God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By this means the teror of death will be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, there is no ſuch way to take off the terror of the thoughts of death as by keeping familiarity with God, death then is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to thoſe that converſe with him. That Reverend Divine that is now with God (Docter <hi>Preſton)</hi> when he was to die he had this ſpeech, <hi>I ſhall but change my place, I ſhall not change my company;</hi> whereas its otherwiſe if thou groweſt-eſtranged from God, when death comes it will look with a terrible face, for then thou haſt to deal with God, thou art then to go into the preſence of the infinite dreadful God, into whoſe preſence thou never hadſt any mind to go before, but ſaith death, I muſt now carry thee into the preſence of God. As thy <hi>Body returns to the duſt, ſo thy ſoul muſt return to God that gave it;</hi> that is, to receive its eternal doom, &amp;c. But now ſaith a Saint, what muſt my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by return to duſt and my ſoul to God that gave it? it is he which I have been with every day, and can ſay as he ſaid, <hi>My ſoul go forth, go forth, why art thou unwilling to go forth to him that thou haſt converſed with all thy daies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, what ſafety is there in being neer to God, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in theſe dangerous times? In the times wherein we live it is ſafe to be neer God; in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 11. <hi>Be not far from me, for trouble is neer,</hi> ſaith <hi>David:</hi> Lord, trouble is neer me, be not thou far from me. It's a bleſſed thing to have God neer us when
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104284:25"/>
trouble is neer us. Trouble is neer many of you, perhaps there's not a ſpans breadth between death and us, what a bleſſed thing is it then to have God to be neer us? When the poor Chickin ſees the Kite come neer to ſeize upon it, and is like to be ſuppri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; if the Hen be neer, it runs to the Hen, and the Hen covers it, and keeps it ſafe; So it ſhould be with us, for ſo Chriſt ſaith of Jeruſalem, <hi>How often would I have gathered thee as a Hen gathereth her Chickens?</hi> There are a company of Kites abroad in the world, and we are poor ſhiftleſs Creatures; now how happy are we then if we can run under the ſhadow of Gods wing? There is a kind of ſhadow in the preſence of God in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the creature; but the ſhadow of God that we have in his Worſhip that is as the ſhadow of his Wing. There is the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a Tree, and that may help from ſome kind of troubles; but there's another manner of ſhadow under the ſhadow of the wing of the Hen, becauſe that nouriſhes the Chicken: The men of the world they have the ſhadow of the Tree, as it were, Gods general providence which is over all creatures; but the Saints of God that draw nigh to God, they have the ſhadow of Gods Wing, like the ſhadow of the Hens wing to the Chicken, which doth comfort it, and ſafe-guard it. Let us by the duties of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thus draw nigh to God, and keep nigh unto Him.</p>

            <p>If in the duties of Worſhip, we are nigh to God, then hence appears the great Honor that God puts upon His Servants that do Worſhip him: Certainly the Worſhipers of God have great Honor put upon them, becauſe the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104284:26"/>
them to draw nigh unto Him, they are ſuch as are precious and honorable in his eyes. I will not enlarge my ſelf in this, only give you three Scriptures that ſhew the great honor and reſpect that God puts upon thoſe that he doth admit to come and worſhip him.</p>
            <p>The firſt Scripture is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 17. There <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of the people of Iſrael, and the great reſpect that God ſhewed to them more than others; for ſaith he, <hi>What Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo Nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?</hi> What Nation is there ſo great as you are? <hi>(So great!)</hi> How doth it appear that the Nation of Iſrael is a greater Nation than other Nations are? How? <hi>That hath God ſo Nigh unto them in all things that they call upon him for:</hi> herein any man or woman, or Nation, may be ſaid to be great, that is, greatly honored by the Lord God, in that they have the Lord nigh unto them, and they are nigh unto him; here's the greatneſs of a Nation: You would think that if one would deſcribe the greatneſs of a Nation, it ſhould be in their great Wealth, their great Trading and Traffick that they have, and the Fertile place that they live in: No, this is not the greatneſs of a Nation, But <hi>what Nation is there ſo great, that hath the Lord God ſo nigh to them?</hi> There's the greatneſs of a Nation: and ſo a ſpiritual heart would account greatneſs to conſiſt in having God to be nigh unto it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Scripture is in <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 9. There we have <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſpeaking unto the ſons of <hi>Korah,</hi> rebuking them for their ſin, and he brings this aggravation to them of the greatneſs of their ſin, ſaith he, <hi>Seemeth it but a ſmall thing unto you, that the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael hath ſeparated you from the Congregation of Iſrael to bring you neer to Himſelf?</hi> That is, That you ſhould come to worſhip him, Is this a ſmall thing to you? Is not this honor enough? As if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have ſaid, Why do you contend for any more Honor, the Lord hath ſeparated you, to bring you neer to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>This you will ſay was ſpoken to the Prieſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But it may be ſaid of every gracious ſoul, for every Beleever Chriſt hath made a King, Prieſt, and Prophet unto himſelf; now there is no Beleever, but Jeſus Chriſt hath ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104284:26"/>
him or her from the reſt of the world to be neer unto God. This is the dignity that God hath put upon thee, that thou art ſeparated by His grace to be one neer to Him, whereas others of the world they depart from Him, continually depart more and more from Him; but (I ſay) the Lord by his grace hath ſet thee apart for Himſelf, as he ſaith in <hi>Pſal,</hi> 4. 3. <hi>The Lord hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelf:</hi> Thou art ſeparated from the world, To what end? It is, that thou mighteſt be neer to Him, this is thy priviledg, and thou ſhouldeſt account it thy great Honor (thou haſt not that Honor and reſpect in the world as others have, but thou art one of Gods ſeparate Ones, that thou art neer to Him.</p>
            <p>A third Scripture is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 28. There you may ſee how the Prophet <hi>David</hi> did highly eſteem of that great Honor that the Lord did put upon him in this in being neer to God: <hi>But it is good for me to draw neer to God.</hi> Mark how he ſpeaks, <hi>But it is good for me:</hi> Why? <hi>For loe, they that are far from thee, ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: thou haſt deſtroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, There are ſome that did ſeem to be neer unto thee heretofore, that were as the Wife to the Husband, but they are gone a whoring from thee; baſe Hypocrites, baſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates, they are gone a whoring from thee, their hearts being carnal, they did not find that Contentment and ſatisfaction in thy Worſhip as thy Saints do, and therefore they are gone a whoring from thee; but it is good for me to draw neer to thee. It is an excellent Scripture. Do you ſee any yong ones, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were very forward not many yeers ago, and would ſpeak of good things, and ſeem to rejoyce in the Word, but now they are gone a whoring, they are departed from God and His Waies, and the pleaſures of the fleſh hath taken their hearts? <hi>Thou wilt deſtroy them</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) that go a whoring from thee.</hi> So thou ſhouldeſt think with thy ſelf; Oh miſerable is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe who once were forward in the profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and now are gone a whoring from God; <hi>But it is good for me to draw neer to God,</hi> they are gone from thee, <hi>and thou wilt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them; but it is good for me to draw neer to thee;</hi> I bleſs my ſelf in drawing neer to thee, the Lord, and bleſs the time that ever I did draw neer to thee, and that ever I knew thoſe waies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104284:27"/>
my ſoul hath drawn neer to God. Such as worſhip God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and do delight in the Worſhip of God they are ſuch as have a great honor put upon them, they do draw nigh to God. And thus we have finiſhed the firſt Point.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Point is that will hold us ſome time, and that is, <hi>The Sanctifying Gods Name in our drawing neer to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we worſhip God we draw nigh to Him, but let us take heed how we draw nigh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>Let us draw neer with a true heart. Look to thy feet when thou comeſt into the houſe of God, Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 1. Now for the Sanctifying of Gods Name in drawing nigh to Him we ſhall endeavor to open it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In ſhewing you wherein the Sanctification of Gods Name conſiſts, or what we ſhould do that we might ſanctifie the Name of God in drawing nigh to Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Reaſon why God will have his Name to be Sanctified in thoſe that do draw nigh to Him.</p>
            <p>How we ſhould ſanctifie the Name of God in drawing nigh to Him, it is under theſe two Heads:</p>
            <p>Firſt, There muſt be a dew preparation unto the Worſhip of God that we exerciſe our ſelves in at any time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A right behavior of our ſouls in it: in theſe two things conſiſts the Sanctifying of Gods Name in His Worſhip. Now under theſe Two Heads all that I ſhall ſpeak about the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the Sanctifying of Gods Name will be contain'd. At this time I ſhall only ſpeak to the Firſt:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The due preparation of the Soul unto the Duties of Gods Worſhip:</hi> Therein conſiſts a ſpecial part of the Sanctifying of Gods Name in drawing nigh to him. And that it is ſo, we find it in Scripture, That preparation for Worſhip it is called the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our ſelves; and by finding this in Scripture, it hinted me upon this Head, to ſpeak of the preparation unto worſhip in our ſanctifying Gods Name, becauſe I find in Scripture that the ſanctifying of our ſelves for Worſhip, and the preparation of our ſelves for Worſhip, are al one: I'le give you theſe two texts; In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 5. you ſhall find there, that <hi>Samuel</hi> when he was ſent by God to anoint <hi>David</hi> in Bethlem, the text ſaith, <hi>I am come to ſacrifice unto the Lord: ſanctifie your ſelves, and come with me to the ſacrifice. Do you come peaceably</hi> ſay they? <hi>Yes,</hi> what then?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104284:27"/>
               <hi>Sanctifie your ſelves and come with me to the Sacrifice:</hi> That's all one, as if he ſhould have ſaid, Prepare your ſelves and come with me to the Sacrifice: and ſo in <hi>Job,</hi> 1. 5. there you ſhall find that the holy man <hi>Job</hi> when his ſons had been feaſting, he was ſomewhat afraid leſt there ſhould be ſome miſcarriage, and that they had ſinned againſt God in their feaſting (as it is very hard to give liberty to pleaſe the fleſh and not to ſin, not to tranſgreſs bounds) therefore <hi>Job,</hi> though he did not hear of any notorious abuſe of their feaſting, yet he was afraid leſt they ſhould ſin, he knew how dangerous it was to have ſo much ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the fleſh and not to tranſgreſs bounds, therefore it is ſaid, <hi>he ſent to his ſons and ſanctified them. It was ſo</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>when the daies of the feaſting were gone about, that</hi> Job <hi>ſent and ſanctified them:</hi> that <hi>Job</hi> ſent unto them to prepare them to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſacrifice, to prepare them for the Worſhip of God: So that the Scripture holds forth this then, that to prepare for Worſhip it is, to ſanctifie for worſhip, and ſo it is one ſpecial thing that is required in our ſanctifying of God, in our drawing nigh to God, to make a due preparation for his holy Worſhip, Now for the orderly handling of things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhal ſhew you <hi>That we muſt prepare for the Worſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew you, <hi>Wherein this preparation for the Worſhip of God doth conſiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The excellency that there is in this,</hi> or <hi>what great good there is in preparation for Gods Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>I ſhall Anſwer a caſe of Conſcience or two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, I will ſhew you, <hi>What is the behavior of the ſoul in San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Gods Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Reaſons why God will be ſanctified in the duties of his Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That there muſt be preparation to the Worſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt, That God that we come to worſhip, is a great and glorious God, and we having to deal with ſuch an infinite, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, dreadful Majeſty, it is fit that we ſhould make prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when we come nigh unto him: therefore in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10. when God came among the people to give them his Law, he did require that <hi>they ſhould be ſanctified to day and to morrow, and that they ſhould waſh their cloaths and be ready againſt the third day, for</hi>

               <hi>the third day the Lord would come down upon mount Sinai in the ſight of the people.</hi> God did not ſo much ſtand upon their cloaths, but it was to ſignifie an inward waſhing. Now my breathren, if when God came to give the Law they were ſo to prepare, then certainly when we are come to worſhip God in the way of the Goſpel, we are to prepare as well as they, becauſe God is coming, For that that is obſervable is, Why they were for two daies together to make ſuch preparation, the argument is becauſe of the preſence of God; <hi>The Lord ſaid to</hi> Moſes, <hi>Go and Sanctifie the people to day and tomorrow, and let them waſh their cloaths, and be ready againſt the third day,</hi> Why? <hi>for the Lord will come down in the ſight of all the people upon mount Sinai:</hi> The Lord will come down in the third day, and therefore let them be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſied. So when thou goeſt to worſhip God, thou expecteſt, or ſhouldeſt expect that God will come to thee, and that thy heart ſhall be drawn to God, and therfore thou ſhouldeſt make ſome preparation. (For the time of preparation we ſhall ſpeak to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when we come to the caſes of Conſcience about prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for worſhip.) And ſo in <hi>Chr.</hi> 22 5. 14. <hi>David</hi> makes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the Houſe of God, becauſe it was the Houſe of God that he had to build, though he could not do it himſelf in his own time, yet being the Houſe of God, what great preparation was made by <hi>David?</hi> The moral of which is this, That the Houſe of God being a Type of the Church, and the Worſhip of God, as well as of Chriſt; it ſhews that there ſhould be much preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when we have to deal with God in his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As God is great that we draw nigh to, ſo the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods Worſhip are great duties, they are the greateſt things that doth concern us in this world, and it is a ſign of a very carnal heart to ſlight the duties of Gods Worſhip, to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them as little matters: Carnal hearts ordinarily, the things that concern their buſineſſes in the world they think great matters; Oh I may not neglect that, I may not neglect that, I may not neglect ſuch a buſineſs, or I may not neglect to viſit or gratifie ſuch a friend; but now for the Worſhip of God it is good indeed, but whether it be done or not, it is no great matter therefore they can put off Prayer; if they have any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs the time of prayer muſt pay for it; they can put off that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104284:28"/>
upon any ſlight occaſion, they do not account the duties of Gods Worſhip great matters; My brethren I beſeech you learn this leſſon this morning, to account the duties of Gods Worſhip great matters, they are the greateſt things that do concern you here in this world; for they are the homage that you tender up to the high God, as you heard, and thoſe things wherein God communicates himſelf in his choiſe Mercies, now being ſuch great matters there is cauſe that we ſhould prepare. For that one thing of prayer, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> It is a great work, and a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult work, and therefore there had need be preparation for it: Buſineſs of great conſequence we make preparation for, indeed if a buſineſs be a ſlight buſineſs we can fall upon it on a ſudden, you make not preparation to go in a Boat one the Thames, but to go a voyage you make great preparation. Now if men and women would but underſtand the duties of Gods Worſhip to be great, they would ſee a neceſſity to make a preparation; Many men for want of preparation to duties they loſe a great part of the time, when they come to perform a duty of Worſhip in prayer, they ſpend half the time that is convenient to be ſpent in prayer before they begin to pray; and ſo in hearing the Word, they are a long time before they can ſettle themſelves to attend to the Word, or in any other kind of worſhip; I ſay a great deal of time in the worſhip is ſpent ordinarily before we can get our hearts to cloſe with the worſhip; now that is a ſore and a great evil to loſe any part of the time of worſhip: Chriſtians, I beſeech you account highly of the time of your worſhip, you have been ſo long time at prayer, yea, but how much of it hath been loſt becauſe you have not prepared beforehand for it? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you kneel'd upon your knees, but you were a long time before you could get your hearts warm at your work, why you ſhould have been warm before you had come: It is ſo often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with many men, when they meet together and there is no preparation for their buſineſs, they come together and they are a long time before they can buckle to the buſineſs that they came about, becauſe there is no preparation, but if there be preparation made, that every man knows beforehand what his work is, they can fall to it, and they can diſpatch as much in one hour as others do in two or three; but of that we ſhall ſpeak more afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:104284:29"/>
Thirdly, There muſt be preparation becauſe our hearts are naturally, exceedingly unprepared for every good work, we are all naturally even <hi>reprobate to every good work,</hi> the duties of Gods Worſhip are high and ſpiritual, and holy things, but by nature our hearts grovel in the dirt and we are carnal, ſenſual, droſſie, dead, ſlight, ſottiſh, and vain, altogether unſit to come into the preſence of God: Oh that we were but apprehenſive and ſenſible of the unfitneſs of our hearts to come into Gods preſence! Perhaps becauſe thou knoweſt not God thou canſt ruſh into his preſence without any more ado, but if thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt thy ſelf, and God, thou couldeſt not but ſee thy ſelf alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unfit for his preſence, and ſo as to wonder that the Lord ſhould not ſpurn thee out of his preſence every time thou comeſt unto him, there had need then be preparation becauſe we are ſo unſit to come into his preſence.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There had need be preparation becauſe of the great hinderances of the Worſhip of God. This buſineſs and the other buſineſs would hinder; the intanglements, they would hinder; the temptations of the Devil, they would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſometimes the indiſpoſition of our bodies doth mightily hinder; and the ſtirrings of the paſſions of our minds they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: if there be any buſineſs fals out amiſs in the family, and any thing go but croſs, how are we put off the hinges and made unfit for holy duties! There had need be preparation therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſo many hinderances in the way; many of you will complain that you are much hindered, but do you do what you can to make preparation beforehand? Do the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances that you complain of put you on to be ſo much the more carefull to make due preparation for Holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, We find that the Heathens themſelves by the light of Nature when they did but worſhip their Idol gods, they would make ſome preparation, ſuch as was ſutable to thoſe gods that they worſhiped, therfore they would waſh their fleſh and purge themſelves, but though their preparation was but very poor, yet they taught us thus much, That they were convinc'd in their conſciences that when God was to be worſhiped, people ſhould be prepared.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:104284:29"/>
The ſixt and laſt reaſon hath a great deal in it, which I beſeech you conſider of; we find that the Scripture doth make the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of the heart much to conſiſt in <hi>preparation</hi> for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and doth make the falſneſs of the heart to conſiſt in this, that men do not <hi>prepare.</hi> Perhaps you have not ſo much thought of this, but yet it is of excellent uſe unto you. We ſhall find the Scripture doth make the very uprightneſs of the heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the <hi>preparation</hi> for duty; and the falſneſs of a mans heart to conſiſt in this, That he makes not conſcience to prepare his heart for God and His Worſhip: And this I will ſhew unto you very plainly and cleerly; take theſe two Examples, The firſt of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and the ſecond of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> one a wicked man whoſe heart was falſe, and the other a godly man whoſe heart was right with God. The falſneſs of the heart of the one is in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 14. there you have what Gods thoughts of <hi>Rehoboam</hi> were in the verſes before: but now he brings the reaſon of his ſentence upon him, and ſaith the text, <hi>he did evil, becauſe he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his heart to ſeek the Lord:</hi> there were many good things that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did: I might ſhew you ſome things; as how he did obey the Prophet of God, when he was ſeeking to avenge himſelf upon thoſe that did rend themſelves from his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: the Lord did but ſend his Prophet, and though he had an Army ready to revenge himſelf upon thoſe that in a way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion did rend themſelves from under his government, and he obeyed the Word of the Lord but for all that he did evil in the ſight of the Lord: God looked upon him as a man that had no uprightneſs in him, Why? <hi>For he did not prepare his heart to ſeek the Lord:</hi> Saith God, I look upon all <hi>Rehoboam</hi> did, as nothing; look upon his waies as evil, and himſelf as a wicked man, why? Becauſe he did not <hi>prepare</hi> his heart to ſeek the Lord, if his heart had been upright with me, he would have prepared his heart to ſeek me. I beſeech you now lay this text to your hearts, Do you prepare your hearts to ſeek God? when ye go to prayr, Can you ſay that you take pains in preparing your hearts for it? and in hearing the Word; and ſo likewiſe for receiving the Sacrament?</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> a godly man, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 3. there you may ſee what the Lord ſaith of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> that was godly; <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, there are good things found in thee, in that thou haſt taken</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:104284:30"/>
               <hi>way the groves out of the land, and haſt prepared thine heart to ſeek God. Jehoſhaphat</hi> was found guilty in joyning himſelf to wicked men too much, the Prophet comes and ſaith to him, <hi>Wouldeſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? Therfore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord. Jehoſhaphat</hi> here we ſee was very faulty in joyning with thoſe that were wicked, and is rebuked by the Prophet from the Lord; What wilt thou joyn with the wicked? the wrath of God is upon thee: Well, but for all that, (I beſeech you obſerve it) That at that time when the Lord is moſt diſpleaſed againſt <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> and ſends his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in his Name to pronounce this, that the wrath of God is out againſt him; yet for all this, God cannot but take notice of this, that he had an upright heart, though he failed in that particular, <hi>yet there is ſome good found in thee, in that thou haſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thy heart to ſeek God.</hi> Indeed through ſome ſudden temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thou art drawn aſide in this particular act; Yea, but it hath been thy care to prepare thy heart to ſeek me, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard I do look upon thee as having an upright heart. And thus you ſee how much the Scripture puts upon the preparation of the heart to ſeek God. And ſo in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 3. you ſhall find that the Scripture makes the uprightneſs of the heart to conſiſt in this, <hi>And</hi> Samuel <hi>ſpake unto all the houſe of Iſrael ſaying, If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts,</hi> (what then?) <hi>Then put away the ſtrange gods: and Aſhtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and ſerve him only:</hi> As if <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould ſay, If you will return indeed to the Lord, if indeed your hearts be upright (according to what you ſeem to profeſs in turning to God,) Then prepare your hearts to ſeek the Lord. You do not in truth turn to God except you make conſcience to prepare your hearts: Therefore you that never yet knew what it was to make conſcience to prepare your hearts for holy duties, know that you have not turned with all your heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, there hath not been the true turning of your hearts unto the Lord. Thus you ſee there is much lies upon prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the duties of Gods Worſhip: Well, you will ſay, ſeeing there lies ſo much in it, I pray open it wherein it doth conſiſt. To that I anſwer, It conſiſts in theſe Five things, which I ſhall briefly name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:104284:30"/>
Firſt, <hi>In the poſſeſſing the heart with the right apprehenſion of that God before whom we come to tender our duties.</hi> Then do we make conſcience to prepare our hearts, when we labor upon our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to worſhip God, to get our hearts before-hand poſſeſſed with right apprehenſions of the Majeſty of that God that we are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to worſhip, and of the greatneſs and weight of the duty that we are ſetting about, the nature of it, the manner how it is to be performed, the rule by which we are to be guided, the end that we are to aim at: Meditation is a good preparation to holy duties. And theſe are the general Heads of our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our Preparation to Duty. <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What God he is we have to deal with.</hi> Meditate of God in his Attributes, and then meditate of the weight of our Duties, and the nature of them, and the rule of them, and the end of them; get your hearts poſſeſſed with meditations of this nature; and in this, at a ſpecial thing, doth conſiſt your preparation to holy duties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second thing wherein the preparation to a duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, it is this, <hi>The taking off of the heart from every ſinful way,</hi> (the endeavor at leaſt) If there be iniquity in thine hand or heart, labor to put it out: When thou art to come into God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> preſence, do not bring into the preſence of God the love of any ſin in thy heart, but labor to put it from thy heart: in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 5. we find there what is required to preparation; the text ſaith, <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Hear me, ye Levites ſanctifie now your ſelves, and ſanctifie the houſe of the Lord God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthineſs out of the holy place.</hi> That is ſanctifying a thing, to carry forth the filthineſs out of that thing that we would ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie: So the ſanctifying of our hearts it is, by carrying forth the filthineſs out of our hearts, ſo as to be fit for a duty. And in <hi>Job.</hi> 11. 13, 14. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart, and ſtretch out thine hand towards him:</hi> (What then?) <hi>If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedneſs dwell in thy tabernacles.</hi> Theſe Two muſt be together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Third thing is this, <hi>The preparation of the heart it is, The diſ-intangling of the heart from the world, and from all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and buſineſſes in the world.</hi> I am to worſhip God, but how is my heart inſnared and intangled in this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104284:31"/>
buſineſs; Now when I come to worſhip God I muſt lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all, for there's the preparation of the heart, the ſeparating of it for ſuch a work, for that's the nature of Sanctification, the ſeparating of a thing from a common uſe; I am to worſhip God, now I muſt labor to ſeparate my heart from a common uſe: At other times God gives me liberty to let out my heart to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſes; but now when I come to worſhip him, I muſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate my heart from all common uſes, that my heart may be wholly for God. I remember it is ſaid in the ſtory of <hi>Cicil</hi> which was Lord Treaſurer, that when he went to read, he would lay his gown off and ſay, <hi>Lie there Lord</hi> Cicil: So when we go to duty, we ſhould ſay, Lie by world: (and by laying aſide the world I mean, laying aſide of all houſhold affairs, or affairs in trading, &amp;c.) I muſt be as one that hath nothing to do in the world for that time: It is true, the time cannot be ſaid to be holy for this, as the time of the Sabbath day is holy.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, Why may not any time be ſaid to be holy that I ſpend in holy duties? No, that is not enough to make time holy, for the time that God makes holy, it is not holy becauſe of the duties that I perform in it, but the duties that I perform then are more acceptable becauſe they are done in ſuch a time, and ſo that makes a place holy, not becauſe it is appointed for holy duties and uſes, but becauſe it is ſo appointed by God; and the performing a duty in that place is more acceptable to God than in another place: But now though we cannot make our time holy in that ſecond ſenſe, yet in the firſt, it is time ſet apart for a holy uſe, and in that regard it is holy, and ſo we ſhould look upon it as not to have our outward buſineſs to devour that time that is holy in that regard, as <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> When <hi>Tobiah</hi> and <hi>Sanballat</hi> ſent to him to come and confer with them; No, ſaith he, I cannot go, <hi>for the work is great that I have to do:</hi> So we muſt not intangle our ſelves to meddle with other things when we are to come to worſhip God, for our work is great.</p>
            <p>The Fourth thing for preparation is, <hi>To Watch and to Pray:</hi> We ſhould watch over our hearts leſt they be made unfit for duties. So we ſhould prepare for Prayer all day long in this ſenſe, that is, we ſhould watch over our hearts that they be not let out ſo far as to hinder us in prayer when we come to do
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104284:31"/>
it. I remember that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, That the Chriſtians did ſo ſup as if they were to pray: So when thou art in company thou ſhouldeſt watch unto prayer. Oh that you did ſo! you cannot but be conſcious to your ſelves, that oftentimes when you have bin in company your hearts have been put out of tune and frame, that you have been no way fit for prayer; when you come home your houſe and family finds it ſo: You that take ſuch delight in company, and ſitting up late I appeal to your conſciences, whether you can come home and find your ſelves fit either in your family, or cloſet to go and open you hearts to God.</p>
            <p>This is one Note by the way wherby you may come to know whether you have been immoderate in company at any time; God gives not men liberty to be buſie in any outward occaſions ſo as to unfit them for his Service. Preparation conſiſts in that, in watching over your hearts, that you may not be unfitted for any holy duty when God calls you to it, but that you may be ready even to every good work</p>
            <p>The Fifth Note is this, <hi>Preparation conſiſts in the readineſs of the faculties of the Soul, and the Graces of the Spirit of God' preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to act upon the ſetting upon an holy Duty.</hi> When a man or woman ſhall find the faculties of their ſoul, and the graces that are in them, to be ready to act aſſoon as ever they fall upon du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Juſt as you ſee a company of Ringers when they have made all preparation for the raiſing of the Bells, then in an inſtant when thy begin to pul, all the Bels go in that tune that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their skil they ſet them in. And ſo it ſhould be with our hearts, the faculties of our ſouls and graces, though now we are not upon duty, yet we ſhould be ſo ready, that as it were upon a pul, all the faculties of our ſouls, and the graces of Gods Spirit ſhould work in a melodious way; There are thoſe that keep their hearts ſo prepared, as at the very firſt moment that they ſet about the duty of Worſhip, all faculties and graces begin to act and ſtir and are working towards God; As a fire, when all the matter is ready laid, preſently it comes to be kindled and flame out; and thus it ſhould be with our hearts: So that now you ſee wherein preparation of our hearts to Duty conſiſts.</p>
            <p>The next thing is, <hi>The Excellency of this Preparation:</hi> and that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104284:32"/>
may be in way of Application to you to make you to be in love with preparation for holy duties. There is abundance of good in it. As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>By this means we come to make every Duty of Worſhip eaſie to us.</hi> Things are difficult when we come upon them unprepared. If you have a friend come to dinner or ſupper to you, and ſhould come ſuddenly, and you have nothing prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there would be a great deal of ſtir in the houſe; but if you have every thing prepared, it would be carried on in an eaſie way: And the reaſon why people complain ſo much of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in duty, it is, becauſe their hearts are not prepared. Indeed we have naturally many things that keep us off from God, but when the heart is prepared for a holy duty, it goes off as eaſie to God, even into the infinite Ocean of all mercy and goodneſs, as a Ship goes off to be lancht when you have made preparation for it; ſo the heart can go with an holy holdneſs to God when you have made preparation for holy duties. In <hi>Job</hi> 11. (the place which I quoted before for the work of preparation, do but conſider a verſe or two further, and you ſhall find what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of good there comes upon the keeping of the heart prepared in things that are good) verſ. 13. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart, &amp;c.</hi> and then verſ. 15. <hi>Then ſhalt thou lift up thy face with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot; yea, thou ſhalt be ſtedfaſt and ſhalt not fear.</hi> When the heart is prepared for that that is good, when it comes into the preſence of God, it is able to lift up it ſelf without fear, in a ſtedfaſt comfortable way, and this will quit the coſt of any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the heart be prepared <hi>it will do a great deal in a little time.</hi> In a <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 36. it is ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Hezekiah <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced, and all the poeple that God had prepared the people; for the thing was done ſuddenly.</hi> The thing came off freely and ſuddenly when as that they were prepared: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> rejoyced, and bleſſed God for ſuch a mercy as this was: It is a great mercy to have the hearts of people prepared unto a good work. And ſo in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27. 6. the text ſaith, Jotham <hi>became mighty, becauſe he prepared his waies before the Lord his God. Jotham,</hi> he grew mighty by this. And ſo certainly the way to grow to be very ſtrong &amp; mighty, to be able to do a great deal in a little time, it is to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104284:32"/>
there may be as much work done in one hour ſo, as in ten times ſo much time when the heart is not prepared for it. In <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 10. you ſhall find that the reaſon is given why <hi>Ezra</hi> had ſuch good ſucceſs in his journey, it was, becauſe he had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his heart. Make preparation for holy duties, and you ſhall have ſucceſs in holy duties. There is a notable Scripture for that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. where the holy Ghoſt ſaith, that God <hi>prepares the heart:</hi> And what then? when God doth prepare the heart, he doth then <hi>cauſe his ear to hear.</hi> There was never a prayer made wherein the heart was prepared for it, but that prayer was heard, they go both together; Lord, thou wilt <hi>prepare their heart,</hi> and thou wilt <hi>cauſe thine ear to hear;</hi> if God hath once prepared thy heart, thou wilt be ſure to be heard then: Is it not worth a world for to know ones ſelf to be accepted of God in every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Worſhip that we tender up to him? this one Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 17. will ſhew it. Oh the excellency that there is in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to duty!</p>
            <p>There is one thing more that is very obſervable, and that is this, <hi>Where the heart is prepared to Duties, there the Lord will paſs by weakneſſes and imperfections in duties.</hi> When thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to perform holy duties thou art troubled, Will the Lord have regard to ſuch a duty as this is? Thou maieſt have certain aſſurance that the Lord will have regard if thou canſt make this point good to thine own ſoul, that it was thy care to make preparation for this duty; Canſt thou ſay, Lord, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored and done what I could to fit my heart for duty, but O Lord, I find when I am at it, wonderful diſtractions, much deadneſs and vanity, What ſhall I do? Why, canſt thou make good the former, and appeal to God, that indeed it was thy care to make preparation? I'le give thee one Scripture then for the quieting of thy heart in this, That the weakneſs of the duty ſhall be pardoned and paſt by where there is care to prepare beforehand; the Scripture is in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 18, 19. <hi>But</hi> Hezekiah <hi>prayed for them ſaying, The good Lord pardon every one;</hi> what, every one? <hi>every one that prepareth his heart to ſeek the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not clenſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Oh Lord, there are many things amiſs in this People, they are not in many regards pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104284:33"/>
according to the order that thou haſt ſet, but Lord, if thou doeſt but ſee any heart prepared to ſeek thee, though they fail in ſuch particulars, Lord heal them and pardon them: and did God hearken to his prayer? Mark the following words, <hi>And the Lord hearkned to</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>and healed the people. Nay</hi> ſaith God, I wil not ſtand ſo much upon the purification of the Sanctuary if they have prepared their hearts to ſeek me. Take this Scripture, know it's written for thine inſtruction, and thou mayeſt make uſe of it to thine own ſoul this day, if thou canſt appeal to God that thou art careful to prepare thy heart, though thou ſhouldeſt not have that pureneſs of thy heart as thou doeſt deſire, the Lord will pardon thee and heal thee: make conſcience of preparation to holy duties.</p>
            <p>Again further, By being careful to make preparation for duties, within ſome little time thou wilt bring the heart to ſuch a frame as it will alwaies be ready for duty without much ado; Indeed at firſt it is ſomewhat hard.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, Are we bound to ſpend ſome time every time we go to prayer beforehand, or every time we come to the Word? That ſhould have been one of the Caſes of Conſcience, but I cannot come to Anſwer that, but this we may ſay, Be careful to prepare for duties, you that are yong beginners, or you that have made profeſſion a longer time, but yet have not had the weight of this duty upon your ſpirits; now be careful for a while to prepare for every duty of Gods Worſhip, that God calls you to, and I ſay within a little time thou mayeſt bring thy heart into ſuch a temper as thou mayeſt be ready at all times to perform holy duties: becauſe you ſhall be able to come to that temper and frame that the Apoſtle exhorts to, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> for indeed ſo it ſhould be with us, we ſhould be alwaies prepared either for Prayer, hearing the Word, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Sacraments. Now becauſe Sacraments are ſo rare thoſe that have any enlightened conſcience they think they dare not but prepare for Sacraments, but you ſhould be alwaies in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the receiving of the Sacraments, as the primitive Chriſtians did. And thoſe that have been acquainted with this Point that I am upon, of preparing for duties, they have come to ſuch a frame of ſpirit, as that there is not ſo much time
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104284:33"/>
required of them as of others, for they are in a conſtant fitneſs, ſo that there is no inſtant of time in the whol day, but if God calls them to prayer, they could preſently fall down upon their knees and pray ſo as to Sanctify Gods Name in prayer, that were an excellent temper indeed if you could find it ſo, that you walk ſo ſpiritually and holily before God as there could be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a quarter of an hour from morning to night, nor from the beginning of the week to the end, but if you were cal'd to pray, or to receive the Sacrament, you had your heart fitted, that you could come into Gods preſence with a prepared heart, and were able to ſanctify Gods Name in the duty. Acquaint your ſelves with this work of Preparation, and ſo you may have hearts fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come into Gods preſence at any time.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE proceed now to what remains. There are only for the perfecting of this Point two Caſes of Conſcience to be reſolved: And then we are to proceed to other things.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is, Whether we ought at all times to ſet apart ſome time for <hi>Preparation</hi> to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty of Gods Worſhip?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Suppoſe we do not find our hearts prepared as we do deſire; Whether it were better to leave off the duty than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it?</p>
            <p>For the Firſt of theſe, <hi>Viz.</hi> Whether we are alwaies bound to ſet ſome time apart for preparation to the duty that we are to perform.</p>
            <p>The anſwer to that is this; we muſt diſtinguiſh of perſons; There are ſome that are exerciſed in the way of godlineſs, and do keep their hearts cloſe with God in the waies of holineſs; now for them it may be ſuppoſed that through their exerciſe in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104284:34"/>
the waies of Godlineſs, and keeping of their hearts conſtant with God in communion with him, walking with God cloſely, that they are at all times <hi>prepared to every good work,</hi> and fitted to fulfil that command of the Apoſtle, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> that is, in the diſpoſition of their hearts, they are fit to pray at any time, there is no day in the week, nor no hour in the day, but they (if God call them to it) could fall down to ſolemn Prayer. And indeed this is an excellent condition, and a good evidence of the hearts walking cloſe with God, that there is no time but they are fit to pray, and fit for any Ordinance, yea, to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper. It is poſſible to keep the heart ſo cloſe to God, as to be fit for Prayer and for the hearing of the Word, and for receiving the Sacrament every day, or any hour in the day; but this needs a very cloſe walking with God and communion with God; and the truth is, this is very rare; moſt men let out their hearts ſo much to other things, as their conſciences cannot but tell them, that if God call them to Prayer at ſuch a time in the day they are altogether unfit for it: If they were called to receive the Sacrament, their conſciences would accuſe them, and tell them, they are unfit for it: but it is not ſo with thoſe that walk cloſe with God, though they be in the world.</p>
            <p>You wil ſay, <hi>If a man have buſineſs in the world, how can this be?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes, Though they have buſineſs in the world, yet they carry the heavenlineſs of their hearts along with them: <hi>Our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in Heaven</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.) Now the word that is tranſlated, <hi>Our Converſation,</hi> it is a word that ſignifies <hi>Our City Converſe,</hi> our trading is in Heaven: when we go to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Exchange, or about any buſineſs, yet our trading is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in Heaven. But now there are other ſorts of people that had need at all times to look to their hearts in way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Thoſe that firſt ſet upon the duties of Religion, yong beginners, that begin at firſt to ſet their faces towards Heaven, to worſhip God, they had need look to their hearts, they ſhould ſpend ſome time in <hi>Preparation</hi> when they come to holy Duties, and the truth is, When the conſcience of a man or woman is at firſt enlightned and awakened, they will be very careful in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104284:34"/>
preparing to holy duties, the fear of God it is mighty upon their ſpirits at firſt; and it ſhould not be leſs afterward; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Gods fear ſhould bring their hearts to ſuch a holy temper as to make them fit for holy duties alwaies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe men and women that any time ſhall ſin againſt conſcience, ſhall commit ſuch ſins as ſhall in a kind even lay waſt conſcience, ſhall break their peace between God and their ſouls; they had need ſpend ſome time in preparation for holy duties, they cannot come into the preſence of God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy communion with God, but they had need beforehand be very ſerious in the examination of their hearts, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor the working of their hearts into mourning for their ſin, and to labor to poſſeſs their ſouls with the preſence of God even before they come. Theſe two ſorts of people, ſuch as have not been acquainted with the waies of Godlineſs, or ſuch as have broken their peace with God by ſome evil carriage of theirs towards God in ſome vile way, (I ſay) it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them to be more ſolemn in the Work of Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But now for the Second Caſe, which indeed is the main; Suppoſe when we come to duties, and begin to examine our hearts, and begin to bethink our ſelves whether we be prepared yea or no to holy duties, and we do not find our hearts prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to that that we do deſire, Whether then we may let the duty go for that time, and forbear the performance of it; as ſuppoſe Prayer, or receiving the Sacrament, or coming to the Word, or any other holy Duty?</p>
            <p>And the reaſon of this doubt is Becauſe when any man or woman is conſciencious, they think with themſelves that they muſt Sanctifie Gods Name in Holy Duties; now if they cannot find their hearts in a fit diſpoſition to ſanctifie the Name of God in holy duties, they are ready to think thus, Were it not better to neglect this duty and lay it aſide for the preſent? Will God accept of a duty when I perform it, and am not ſet for it?</p>
            <p>Therefore for the Anſwer to this, becauſe it is a temptation that ſometimes carnal hearts have, and they are ready to take this temptation, and willing to neglect the duty upon ſuch a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104284:35"/>
thoughts as this, that they are not prepared: And the truth is, they are more glad to let the duty fall, than they are ſorry for want of the preparation of their hearts for the duty. I beſeech you conſider of this, whether you have not found it ſo, that ſometimes when you have not been fit to perform a holy duty, there hath not been a more ſecret willingneſs of the heart to let the duty go, than a ſorrow of the heart becauſe you are not fit for the duty. This is a very evil ſign that the heart is very much diſtempered. Thoſe that are godly indeed when they find not their hearts prepar'd for the duty, it is the trouble of their ſouls, it is that which goes neer their hearts, when they think with themſelves that they are now like to loſe a duty of the Worſhip of God, they are now like to loſe their communion with God in a holy duty, they even look upon themſelves in an evil caſe in regard of this; and it makes them watchful for time to come to take heed of thoſe things that have put them in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparation as they find their hearts to be in at this time: Now if it be ſo with thee, it is a good ſign that thy heart may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right with God though through infirmity it comes at ſuch a time to be unprepared for the duty.</p>
            <p>But yet ſuppoſe I find I am not prepared, I am griev'd and troubled at it, (for that muſt be premiſed) whether were I better to leave the duty for this time than to fall upon it in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparation as this is?</p>
            <p>Now for the Anſwer to this Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That which I would anſwer to it is this, The omiſſion of a duty, or the laying of a duty aſide, will never fit the ſoul for a duty afterwards; it is no way to make thy ſoul more fit afterwards, becauſe thou haſt laid it aſide now for the preſent; do but obſerve your own hearts that way, and you will find this by experience: Such a time you have been buſie in the world, and occaſions have hindered you ſo as your heart is out of temper and frame for a duty, you lay it aſide; now are you more fit the next day? If you do neglect duty in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon any buſineſs, are you fitter to perform duty at night becauſe of it? you will not find it to be ſo: The forbearing a duty now, will not make the ſoul fitter for a duty afterwards? therefore it is no wiſdom to forbear a duty for want of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104284:35"/>
becauſe the forbearance will never help to further pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partion, but will make the ſoul more unfit for duty. It is an excellent Speech that I read, that <hi>Luther</hi> hath concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>I have learned this by experience, that the oftener I do omit duty, the oftener do I make my ſelf the more unfit for duty, and cauſe I have to abhor my ſelf.</hi> It is not the deferring that makes thee the more fit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Therefore conſider that this is but a temptation, and that is the ſecond thing that I would propound to thoſe that ſhall omit a duty becauſe they are not prepared, That this is but a temptation to keep thee from it, to tell thee that thou art not prepared; and if thou ſhalt forbear it becauſe thou art not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, in this thing thou doeſt gratifie the Devil, and the Devil hath what he would have, and ſo would be encouraged to tempt thee another time becauſe he hath now what he would have, in cauſing thee to forbear the duty; Firſt, he laboreth to unfit thee for it, and then he tempts thee to forbear it becauſe thou art unfit, this is the ſubtilty of the Devil. From whence is it that thou art unfit, but from the temptation of the Devil? And I find <hi>Luther</hi> again, that was a man that had as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God as any in his daies, and a man that had as much to draw his heart away, as many temptations, and as many bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes as any, for indeed the great cauſe of Chriſt in all the Chriſtian world in a great meaſure under God lay upon his ſhoulders, and yet ſaith he, <hi>If any one think that prayer muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd till the ſoul be purified from impure cogitations, he doth no other than help the Devil, who is powerful enough;</hi> he thinks to be wiſe in deferring the duty becauſe he is not fit, and he hath many ill thoughts and troubles in his ſpirit, he doth nothing elſe (ſaith <hi>Luther)</hi> but gratify the Devil that is ſtrong enough without this. Oh let us take heed of gratifying the Devil in his temptations, therefore remember it is a temptation for thee to omit a duty meerly becauſe thou art not prepared for the duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the Third place, That which I would anſwer to this Queſtion is this, If any one perform a duty of Worſhip in that ſincerity and ſtrength that he is able to do it, though he be not prepared as he ought, yet it is better to do it than to neglect it. It is true, ſome do perform a duty in a meer formal way, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104284:36"/>
to ſatisfie their conſciences, or to cloak and cover ther ſins and the like; perhaps they may ſo perform it as it might be better to be unperformed than to perform it as they do, but if you do endeavor to the uttermoſt of your ſtrength to do it, though you be not prepared as you do deſire, yet it is better to do it than to omit the doing of it, and you will find it ſo, for one duty doth prepare for another. Though it be not done as I deſire it ſhould be done, yet the doing of it as well as I can at this time will help me to do it better at another time, that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: as one ſin doth prepare the heart for another ſin, ſo one duty prepares the heart for another; as now, ſuppoſe a man commits a ſin, and he hath a conſcience that is enlightened that doth hinder him from committing his ſin with that full ſtrength that he would do it; many a man hath a mind to ſin, but through the enlightening of his conſcience he cannot ſin with that delight as he would, becauſe his conſcience flies in his face and doth interrupt him, but yet for all this through the ſtrength of his corruption he will break through to that ſin; now though at firſt they cannot commit that ſin with that delight and freedom as they do at other times, yet if their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions be ſo ſtrong as to break through the light of their conſciences, the next time they come to the committing of that ſin they will commit it with more freedom and eaſe a great deal.</p>
            <p>This is evident by experience; there is none of you but if you well obſerve your hearts you will find this, A temptation comes to a ſin, now you connot do it with ſo much freedom as you would, but yet you break through it, you will find that the next time you will commit it with more freedom, and ſo one ſin will prepare for another, and it may be you have ſome trouble of conſcience at firſt, but the next time you will have leſs trouble, till at length you can commit it freely without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny trouble of Conſcience at all. As it is in ſin, ſo it is in godlineſs many times, in ſome degree; at the firſt you have a motion to a holy duty, but through the ſtirrings of your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions you are not fit for it, now do you but break through that difficulty, and the next time you will be more fit, and the next time after that you will be more fit, and ſo ſtill more and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104284:36"/>
more fit as it is in ſin, If a man when he hath ſome trouble of conſcience would but liſten to his conſcience and would not commit that ſin his conſcience would grow ſtronger upon him, and ſtrengthen him againſt that ſin; ſo if any man or woman li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens to the temptation to defer duty and put it off becauſe they are not prepared, why after that the corruption will grow more ſtrong, therefore ſet upon the duty, and the peformance of one duty will prepare for another.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the fourth place, While men and women are ſtrugling with their ſouls and the corruptions of their hearts, and do not fall upon ſeeking God, they by their very ſtrugling to prepare themſelves many times do enſnare themſelves; It may be thou haſt thoughts of Atheiſm or other wickedneſs, the very ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with thoſe thoughts may enſnare thy heart; now the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way were to fall upon prayer, and to cry to God to help thee againſt them, for while thou art ſtrugling and ſtriving with thoſe thoughts thou art ſtriving with the corruption of thy heart and with the Devil all alone: but now when thou falleſt to the duty thou calleſt in the help of God and of Jeſus Chriſt, and that is a great deal better, while thou art muſing, plodding, and troubling thy heart that way, I ſay, thou art ſtrugling alone, but now when thou falleſt upon the duty then thou calleſt in help from God, and ſo thou art more able to the performance of the duty than thou wert before. And therefore it is the beſt way to fall upon a duty though thou canſt not find thy heart prepared as thou doeſt deſire, the very falling upon it will fit thee for it. And thus much for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto thoſe two Caſes of Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Now then we are to proceed further in the opening of the Sanctifying of Gods Name in holy duties. Thus much for the preparation of the heart. But when the heart comes to it, in what manner ſhould the duty be performed ſo as the Name of God may be ſanctified in the duty? or what is the behavior of the ſoul in the ſanctifying of Gods Name when it is in the very act of the duty?</p>
            <p>To that I anſwer, Firſt in general thus, When the ſoul la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to perform duties ſo as God may have ſuch glory from the duty a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is fit for a God to have in ſome meaſure, then do I Sanctifie Gods Name.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:104284:37"/>
You will ſay this is a very hard thing to perform a duty ſo as that we ſhould give God the glory that is fit for a God to have: Certainly this is not done by every manner of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of a duty of Worſhip: yet you ſhall hear this opened to you, and I hope you ſhall have it made very plain before you.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore I ſhall ſhew you, that when we are to perform a duty of Worſhip, we ſhould ſet our ſelves to glorifie God as a God; that is, to do it in that manner that God may have that Glory that is fit for a God to have. As now in the duty of Praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 2. <hi>Make his Praiſe glorious,</hi> that is do it ſo as you may lift up His Name in it, and that God may be glorious in your praiſe. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. there the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Heathens; he doth rebuke them; For what? It was for this, <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful:</hi> now this is ſpoken eſpecially of the Worſhip of God; for he ſaith afterwards, ver. 23. <hi>That they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible men &amp;c.</hi> So that it's ſpoken of the Worſhip of God; that <hi>they glorified not God as God.</hi> That is then to ſanctifie Gods <hi>Name, to glorifie God as God:</hi> and therefore our Savior in the 4. of <hi>John</hi> when he ſpake to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> he tels her <hi>that God is a Spirit, and muſt be worſhiped in ſpirit and truth,</hi> that is, we muſt labor to ſuit our worſhip to what ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is in God; that our worſhip my be proportionable in ſome meaſure even to the nature of God himſelf: And therfore God being a Spirit, His Worſhip muſt be a Divine Worſhip. I have read of ſome of the Heathens that dip worſhip the Sun for a God, and they would offer to the Sun ſomething ſutable; therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did ſo admire at the ſwiftneſs of the motion of the Sun, they would not offer a Snail to the Sun, but a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ying Horſe, a Horſe with wings; now a Horſe is one of the ſwifteſt creatures, and the ſtrongeſt creature to continue in motion for a long time together, and they added wings to the Horſe, and they thought that ſutable to be a ſacrifice for the Sun. So when we come to worſhip God, that is, to ſanctifie His Name, we muſt behave our ſelves ſo as to give him the glory that is fit for a God to have. As now in thoſe three particulars which I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104284:37"/>
opened to you when I ſhewed you wherein we draw nigh to God: This was one, I told you that when we come to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, we come to tender up ſome preſent to God, now then we muſt tender up ſuch a preſent as is ſutable to Gods excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. If a man ſhould come to a poor man to give a preſent, if it were not worthy twelve pence, yet it may be taken well: but if you were to tender up a preſent to a Prince, a Monarch, an Emperor, then you muſt tender a preſent that is fit for the quality of the preſon. Therefore in <hi>Malachi,</hi> 1. 8. When the Lord rebukes them for their ſacrifices that they were ſuch poor things: Go (ſaith God) <hi>and tender up this to your Governor,</hi> and ſee whether he will accept of it or no. So certainly that which may be accepted of by a mean man, would be accounted a ſcorn if you ſhould tender it up to a Prince, or an Emperor. Now when we come to worſhip God, we muſt conſider that we are to tender up our ſervice to God, who is the great King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. But you will ſay, Is it poſſible for any creature which comes to tender up its worſhip to God, to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up that which is fit for a God to have? This may rather be a diſcouragement unto prayer, or any other duty of worſhip than an encouragment.</p>
            <p>To that I anſwer thus, Though we be very poor and mean, yet it doth not hinder, but we may tender up that to God which God will acknowledg to be ſutable to his infinite excellency: as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, If we tender up to God all that we have: Though we be never ſo poor and mean, yet if God hath the ſtrength of our ſouls, God accepts it. For we are to know that God doth not ſtand in need of what we have, or of what we do; but that we might ſhew our reſpect to Him: Therefore if we give all that we have, God accepts it. As a Child, if it puts forth all its ſtrength that it hath to do a buſineſs which the father bids him, whether the buſineſs be doue or no, the father looks upon it and accepts it as ſutable to the childs ſtrength; and it ſhews the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that the child hath to his father. And as it is ſtoried of an Emperor, that when a poor man had nothing to offer him but a little water that he had taken up with his hand, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing elſe, the Emperor accepts of it. So that's that which God looks for, that the Creature ſhould lift him above
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104284:38"/>
all. If therefore when thou comes to worſhip God, God hath more in thy heart than ever any creature in the world had, God accepts of that, and that you muſt look unto: Can you ſay ſo, when you go to worſhip God? Lord it is true, there is much weaknes in my ſpirit, but thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt, That thou haſt more of my heart than ever any creature in the world had. This is ſutable to God, God will account this (in the Covenant of Grace) to be a preſent ſutable to Himſelf. As in the Law, when they offered to the building of the Temple, every one could not offer gold and ſilver and precious ſtones, but ſome came and offered Badgers-skins, and ſome women did ſpin and offered Goate-hair to the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and ſo God accepted of that being the moſt they could do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, When we do not only offer unto God the moſt we can, but when we ad to this the grief of our ſouls that we can do no more, when the ſoul ſhall ſtrive to the uttermoſt it can, and when it hath done all, ſaith, <hi>I am an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervant,</hi> Oh that I could do more! This is ſutable to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The People of God though they be weak, yet the weakeſt Servant of God is able to offer up to God ſomewhat that is ſutable to the infinite Majeſty of God, upon this Third Ground, becauſe there is a kind of impreſſion of Gods infinitnes in thoſe ſervices that a gracious heart doth tender unto God, and therefore ſutable unto God.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, God is an Infinite Glorious God; Be it ſo, He is Infinit that's certain, but the duty of Worſhip that a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions heart tenders unto God, it hath an impreſſion of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitneſs upon it. How is that? If that can be made out, then indeed we may be encouraged to worſhip God. Thus, That that a gracious heart tenders up to God hath an impreſſion of His infinitneſs in this regard, becauſe as God hath no limits of His Being; ſo a gracious heart when it comes to worſhip God, will not propound any limits or bounds, but in the deſires of it would fain be enlarged infinitly if it could. If it were poſſible for a creature to been larged to God infinitly it would be. Here lies (I conceive) the main difference between the moſt glorious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104284:38"/>
Hypocrite in the world, and one that hath true Grace, yea, that hath but the leaſt degree of grace: The moſt glorious Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in the world, who (it may be) for the outward act doth more than one that hath true grace, yet ſuch a one doth limit himſelf: he doth great things, but he doth it ſo, as he limits himſelf, that is, ſo much as may ſerve for ſuch and ſuch ends of his, ſo much as may ſerve his turn, either to ſatisfie his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or to get credit and eſteem, to be accounted eminent in ſuch a way, ſo much he doth do, but his duty is alwaies limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within ſuch bounds; and if he could conceive that he might go to Heaven, and that he might have as much Credit and Honor, and as much peace of Conſcience with doing leſs, he would do leſs. But now, one that hath grace, though but little, though but the leaſt dram of grace, he goes farther, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſaith he, Though through the little grace that I have, I cannot do what another can do; yet this doth ſo enlarge my heart, that I would have no bounds ſet in what I do for God, but I would have it enlarged to the uttermoſt latitude, if it were poſſible, beyond whatever yet was done for God in the world; and the more I do, the more I do deſire to do. That's now a kind of infinitneſs that there is in the heart where grace comes: I ſay, grace enlarges the heart to a kind of infinitneſs, that the more it doth, the more it would do: there is no Hypocrite but will have his periods, he will riſe thus, and thus, and thus high; ordinarily you ſhall find that if he lives in ſome company, there he is high; but if he lives in other company, there he is lower: Now there is nothing doth limit a gracious heart, but to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity it would work and work more and more for God: Here now is a Worſhip that is ſome way ſutable to the infinite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency that there is in God: Here's a kind of proportion (as I may ſo ſpeak) even between the Creature and God himſelf in this thing, but it is the grace of God in the Creature; here is the Image of God indeed, becauſe grace doth ſo enlarge the heart even to an infinitneſs (as it were) for God. And thus you ſee in the general what it is to ſanctifie Gods Name to tender up to God that which is ſome way ſutable to the glory of the infinite God.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Firſt, In what particulars the behavior of the heart may be diſcovered to be ſutable to God in reſpect of Gods greatneſs and glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What the behavior of the heart ſhould be as ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſeveral Attributes of God.</p>
            <p>It will coſt us ſome time to open the particular things in the behavior of the heart as in reference to the greatneſs and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie of God; conſidered more generally; as in <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 48. 1. <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Curſed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male, and voweth and ſacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing:</hi> why? <hi>for I am a great King ſaith the Lord,</hi> and therefore curſed is he that doth not offer a ſacrifice ſutable to my greatneſs. And in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 5. we find that <hi>Solomon</hi> when he was preparing for the Temple, he would build a great Temple, <hi>why?</hi> Becauſe God was a great God that he would build it too: So that the Worſhip of God muſt be ſome great thing becauſe the Lord is a great God, and it muſt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104284:39"/>
be ſutable to his greatneſs. Now if you ask me in what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars doth the behavior of the ſoul conſiſt that is very ſutable to the greatneſs of God in the general? There are many things in this:</p>
            <p>The firſt is, You muſt be careful to bring a ſanctified heart. You cannot tender up a worſhip ſutable to his greatneſs except you bring a ſanctified heart with you, there muſt be holineſs in the heart: Under the Law you know, if any one came to offer a ſacrifice in his uncleanneſs, he muſt be cut off: and ſo it muſt be here, we muſt look to it that we offer not to God in our uncleanneſs: <hi>Waſh you and make you clean,</hi> in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. and then, <hi>Come, let us reaſon together.</hi> There is no coming to God without waſhing and making clean; in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. 5. <hi>Holineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh thy Houſe O Lord for ever:</hi> Holineſs becometh the preſence of God for ever, we muſt look to get a ſanctified heart. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification conſiſts in thoſe two parts, <hi>Mortification,</hi> and <hi>Vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:</hi> there muſt be a mortifying of the luſts of the heart: We reade in the Law, that every Sacrifice was to be <hi>ſalted with ſalt;</hi> that did ſignifie the mortification of our hearts when we come to offer up our ſelves as a Sacrifice to God; the ſalt did eat out the raw humors, and kept the fleſh from putrifying; ſo doth the grace of God in mortifying our luſts, In <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. you have a notable Scripture for the clenſing of our hearts when we come to offer any ſervice to God, <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God purge your Conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God:</hi> So that you cannot ſerve the living God until your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences be purged from dead works: And how comes your conſciences to be purged from dead works? It is <hi>through the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God,</hi> he muſt purge your conſciences; So that here's the way of ſanctifying Gods Name by applying of Jeſus Chriſt who was offered to God without ſpot that our conſciences might be purged from dead works, that we might be purged from that natural filthineſs and uncleannneſs in which we all were; for the whol world doth lie in filth, as a carrion doth lie in his ſlime. Now if we would worſhip God ſo as to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie him, we muſt apply Chriſt to our ſouls, and get our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104284:40"/>
purged from dead works, and to have the Spirit of Chriſt in us to quicken up our hearts in the waies of holineſs; to have the Image of Jeſus Chriſt in us, whereby we may be holy accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our proportion even as he himſelf is holy, this is the ſanctifying of the heart; There muſt be an habitual ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and actual ſanctification of the heart: An Habitual, that is, that the heart muſt be changed through the work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; there muſt be a Regeneration in the heart, there muſt be Divine Principles of the Graces of the Spirit of God in the heart.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, May not an unregenerate man Pray?</p>
            <p>To that I anſwer;</p>
            <p>It is true, it is his duty to pray, <hi>Powr forth thy wrath upon the Heathen, and upon the families that call not upon thy Name:</hi> But it's as true, that they cannot ſanctifie Gods Name in doing of it: But if we would ſanctifie Gods Name in it, there muſt be an Habitual holineſs in the heart, for every thing doth act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Principles, in Nature it is ſo; and ſo doth the heart when it comes to worſhip God, it doth act according to the Principles that it hath.</p>
            <p>And then there muſt not only be Habitual ſanctification, but Actual ſanctification likewiſe; as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 10, 11. there you ſee what ado there was to fit them for the hearing of the Law, becauſe <hi>God was to come among them:</hi> God is to come among us, and we are to come to God when we are to perform holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; therefore it is not enough to have Grace, but there muſt be an improving of Grace, there muſt be an acting of Grace, not only when you come to receive the Sacrament, to think that then there muſt be an acting of Grace, but every time you pray and hear, there muſt be an acting of Grace; A purging out of your corruptions and an acting of Grace. So that one cannot ſanctifie Gods Name in holy duties unleſs he come thus far, to be able to ſay, Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt, there is nothing that thou doeſt reveal to be contrary to thy Will, but my heart is againſt it, that's the leaſt; thou canſt not have any peace of conſcience in drawing nigh to God, until thou come thus far, to have thy heart to work thus againſt ſin
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104284:40"/>
and to be ſet upon every good that God reveals to be his mind. You know when a man of quality comes to your houſe what a deal of ſtir there is, not only in ſweeping, but in making all things as clean and tite and ſhining as poſſible can be: Thus it ſhould be when thou comeſt to God.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon why there muſt be this ſanctifying of the heart is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Lord doth firſt accept of the Perſon before he doth accept of the action: Men indeed do accept of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of men, becauſe they do good actions; but God accepts of the actions of men becauſe theſr perſons are good. If indeed we ſee a man do good, then we love him and accept of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the man, but God firſt will accept of the perſon before the action: As the Lord accepted of <hi>Abel</hi> firſt, and then he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his offering: So you muſt look to that, to have your perſons firſt accepted of God before any duty can be accepted: You think though you be wicked and ſinful, yet if you amend your life, God will accept of you, you go that way to work; but certainly that is the wrong way; you muſt firſt look after means of acceptation of your perſons which is through the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and through the ſanctification of his Spirit, whereby you come to have his Image, and Life, and ſo are accepted, and then all that proceeds from you comes to be accepted. There is not any action which comes from you that comes to be accepted to eternal life, until your perſons be accepted before God, and therefore there muſt be a ſanctifying of the heart before there can be a ſanctifying the Name of God in the duties of his Worſhip: Therefore when you come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any duties of Gods Worſhip, you ſhould conſider this, Is my heart Sanctified? I muſt ſanctifie Gods Name, and how can I do that, except my heart be ſanctified?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our hearts muſt be ſanctified, becauſe the Lord doth look more to the principle from whence a thing comes, than at the the thing it ſelf. As indeed were our hearts right as they ſhould, then all the good things that come to us, we would not ſo much regard what the things are, that we do enjoy from God; as what the principle is from whence they come, that is, Whether what we do enjoy from God is from the love of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104284:41"/>
God in Jeſus Chriſt or no? Whether it it be from the general Bounty and Patience of God, or from the ſpecial love of God in Jeſus Chriſt? Our hearts would regard that moſt if we were ſpiritual: now then, look as a godly man is not ſatisfied with enjoying any good thing from God, except he knows it comes from a principle of love to him in Jeſus Chriſt; So God is not pleaſed with any thing that comes from us, except he knows that it comes from a principle of Love, Grace, and Holineſs in our hearts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, According as the heart is, ſo will the ſervice be; Certainly if the heart be unclean, the duty will be unclean; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the words may be fine and brave, but if there be an unclean heart, the duty will be unclean: As it is with a man that hath the Plague, ſuppoſe he makes a brave Oration, yet his breath is infectious; ſo it is in our ſervices with God: If ſo be that our hearts within us have the plague, then certainly the breath that comes from us, all our duties will be unclean, and therefore that is the firſt thing that we are to look for in the ſanctifying Gods Name in holy duties: Look to have thy heart ſanctified, and conſider from what principle it comes; 'tis for want of this that thouſands of our duties are caſt aſide, and God never doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them: But this is the firſt Particular, there are many more to ſpeak of.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE proceed. The next thing therefore for the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior of the ſoul in the ſanctifying Gods Name in Worſhip, is this:</p>
            <p>When we come to Worſhip God, if we would ſanctifie Gods Name, we muſt have high thoughts of God; we muſt look upon God as he is upon his Throne, in Majeſty, and in Glory; as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 1, 2. you ſhall find, that the Prophet ſaw the Lord upon his Throne: It is an excellent thing when all who come to worſhip God, every time they come to worſhip Him, have their eyes darted up to Heaven, and behold the Lord God ſitting in his Glory upon his Throne: So you ſhall find in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. the 24. Elders that worſhiped God, they ſaw him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne in his Glory, and ſo they worſhiped him; they worſhiped God to purpoſe (indeed) when they ſaw the Lord in that Majeſty as he was. We ſhould at all times have high thoughts of God: take heed of having low thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the infinite Majeſty of God at any time, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when thou art to worſhip the great God, then look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord in that infinite diſtance that there is between him and thy ſelf, yea, that infinit diſtance that there is between him and all creatures in the world, look upon the Lord as lifted up in glory, not only above all creatures, but above all excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that all Angels and Men, in Heaven and Earth are able to imagine: Look upon the Lord as having all Excellencies in Himſelf, joyned in one, and that immutably; look upon him as the Fountain of all excellency, good, and glory that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world have: and look upon the Lord every time thou comeſt to worſhip him, as that God whom Angels do adore, and before whom the Devils are forc'd to tremble; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him in this his Glory, and this will help thee to ſanctifie his Name when thou comeſt to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:104284:42"/>
The great Reaſon why people come and worſhip God in a ſlight way; it is becauſe that they do not ſee God in his glory, 'tis a great Mercy for God to give unto us a ſight of himſelf, a ſight of his glory here in this world while we are worſhiping of him, this would keep our eyes and our thoughts from wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, if we had a ſight of the glory of God, and had high thoughts of God. What's the reaſon why we wander ſo as we do, but meerly becauſe we ſee not God? As now, ſuppoſe you were in your houſe, and looking after every feather that were flying up and down, if you ſhould hear that the King were come into the room, or any great Perſon, it would compoſe your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, becauſe you have high thoughts of ſuch, as of thoſe that are above you: So let us look upon God as in his excellency, and His glory, and have high thoughts of him, and this is that whereby we are to ſanctifie Gods Name when we come before Him in holy duties. And that's the ſecond thing. Firſt a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified heart; and then high thoughts of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third thing is, High-ends, Raiſed-ends in the worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God: <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 24. <hi>The way of life is above to the wiſe:</hi> It is on high in this reſpect, when he worſhips God, his heart is lifted up on high; there is a holy raiſing of the heart which is well pleaſing to God: Our hearts ſhould be on high in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the high ends that we aim at in holy duties: <hi>Lift up thy prayer</hi> ſaith <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to the Prophet in another caſe; ſo I may ſay, Lift up thy ſoul when thou comeſt to worſhip God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the high ends that thou aimeſt at: when we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping God we ſhould have our hearts above all creatures, and above our ſelves. Let not our hearts then be groveling upon the ground, mingled with baſe and droſſie things, when we come to worſhip the Lord: Indeed it is fit that we ſhould have our hearts low (as we ſhall ſhew hereafter) in regard of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but not low in regard of any baſeneſs of ſpirit to mix with any baſe and low ends; Now there are low and baſe ends in worſhiping of God. As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, We muſt take heed we do not ſubject the Worſhip of God unto our Luſts, that is a curſed thing, thou art far from ſanctifying Gods Name in worſhiping of Him that ſhalt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject His Worſhip to thy baſe luſts, this is an abominable, and a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104284:42"/>
curſed thing indeed; You will ſay, Who doth thus? who is the man, or where is he that will do this? ſubject the Worſhip of God to his baſe luſts! To that I anſwer, Whoſoever doth make uſe of any duty of Worſhip, as Prayer, Hearing the Word, or what ever it be, to cloak any kind of wickedneſs, whoſoever is conſcious to himſelf of any kind of ſecret wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and yet ſhall think to cover it by the performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſhall reaſon in this manner, Who will think me to be guilty of ſuch a vile thing, when I pray ſo as I do, and am ſo careful to hear the Word? and I hope I ſhall cover ſome wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs this way. If there be any in this place whoſe conſcience tells them that they ſubject the Worſhip of God to ſuch a baſe end as this is, the Lord rebuke them this day, and ſpeak to their hearts; If I knew any, I would ſet mine eyes upon them and ſay as the Apoſtle to <hi>Simon Magus, I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity;</hi> and as he ſaid to him that did ſeek to draw the Deputy from the Faith, <hi>O thou child of the Devil, and full of all ſubtilty,</hi> to damn and undo thy ſelf eternally, that ſeekeſt to cloak any wicked way by any duty of Gods Worſhip; Is it a great evil for a man or woman to make uſe of any of Gods Creatures to be ſerviceable to their luſts, as meat and drink &amp;c? What a damnable thing is it then to make uſe of any duty of Gods Worſhip, ſometimes extraordinary Worſhip, as Faſting and Prayer, to be a cloak to cover their wickedneſs! Thou art ſo far from ſanctifying Gods Name, that thou polluteſt Gods Name; thou doeſt what in thee lies for to caſt even dirt in the face of God himſelf that doeſt ſo.</p>
            <p>The ſecond baſe end, is to ſubject the duties of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the praiſe of men, as to perform duties of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for the eſteem of men, and becauſe we ſhall be well thought of; take heed of this you yong ones, and others, you would fain be eſteem'd well of by thoſe that you live withal; It is a deſirable thing to have a good eſteem from thoſe that are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but take heed that you do not ſubject the duties of Gods Worſhip to this. Indeed it may be an encouragement to you, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 9. <hi>This is good before thy Saints: David</hi> did encourage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſelf to praiſe God, becauſe it was good before Gods Saints; and I confeſs it may be an encouragement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104284:43"/>
holy duties are good before Gods Saints: but take heed that this be not thy higheſt end that thou aimeſt at, and that which carries thee on in the work, meerly to get the praiſe of men, and that they ſhall think that thou haſt good gifts and parts, and therfore thou art inlarged in that regard; take heed of that; know, that now thou doeſt not worſhip God, but thou worſhipeſt men, thou doſt make the praiſe of men to be thy God, For whatſoever thou doeſt lift up in the higheſt place, that's thy God, whatſoever it be; therefore if thou lifteſt up the praiſe of men, and makeſt that they end, thou makeſt that thy God, and ſo thou art a worſhiper of men, but not a worſhiper of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Take heed of making <hi>Self</hi> thy end; there are ſome that are not ſo baſe and low in their hearts, as to make the praiſe of men their end. but they aim and look at themſelves, that is, they aim at their own peace, and ſatisfying their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the performance of duties; now though it's true, when we perform duties of Gods Worſhip, we may expect to receive ſome good to our ſelves, and we may be encouraged to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the expectation of good to our ſelves; yet we muſt look higher, we muſt look at the honor and praiſe of God, that the Name of the bleſſed God may be honored: Now I am going to Prayer, Oh that I may pray ſo, as I may lift up Gods Name: I am going to Hear, Oh that I may hear ſo, as God may be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by my hearing; 'tis this that carries me on to hearing the Word, and makes me riſe readily, and to go forth cheerfully; I hope that God may have ſome honor by my hearing this day, and God knows that this is the thing that I aim at, I do not come for company, nor to be ſeen of men, neither do I come meerly to ſatisfie mine own Conſcience: Others go and hear ſuch Truths of God as do good to their Souls, and if I ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them meerly for mine own eaſe, my Conſcience would not let me be quiet; howſoever there are many whoſe Conſciences will be quiet enough, though they loſe an opportunity in the Worſhip of God; but yet there are others whoſe Conſciences cannot do ſo, their Conſciences would tell them when they are lying and turning themſelves upon their bed, How do you know but that God had ſomething to ſpeak to thy heart this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104284:43"/>
morning, that may never be ſpoken to thy heart at any other time? therefore they cannot be at quiet except they attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in the duties of his Worſhip: But ſtill this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough meerly to ſatisfie conſcience; thy main end it muſt be that thou maieſt this day know ſome part of the mind of God, that God may ſpeak to thy heart, that ſo thou maieſt be ſitted to honor the Name of God, that thou maieſt be enabled to live to his Honor the week following ſo much the better. As in this manner thy thoughts ſhould be, Lord, I find a droſſie, carnal heart, I am buſie in the world in the week time, and I find that my heart is ſullied and defiled with the buſineſs of the world, and entangled, but Lord, thou haſt appointed thy Sabbath, and Word to be a means to ſanctifie my heart, and to clenſe it; Oh Lord, communicate thy Grace to my ſoul through thy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances upon this Day, that ſo I may be enabled the week following the better to live to thy Honor, Lord, I come into thy preſence to that end, that I might know ſome part of thy Will, and that I might get thy Spirit to be conveyed through this Word of thine into my heart; this ſhould be thy end when ever thou comeſt, and not only <hi>ſelf.</hi> I wil give you two or three Scriptures to ſhew that God regards little any duties where <hi>ſelf</hi> is the higheſt end. The firſt is in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 7. 14. <hi>They howled upon their beds,</hi> (ſaith the text there) <hi>but they cryed not to me.</hi> The Lord there did acknowledg that they were very much affected in their prayers, but what was it? It was but a howling upon their beds: And how ſo? It was becauſe only they did cry for themſelves, <hi>They have not cried unto me</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>with their heart, when they howled upon their beds:</hi> It was but meerly for Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, but not unto Me; they aim'd at <hi>Themſelves,</hi> and not at <hi>Me.</hi> And in <hi>Amos,</hi> 5. 22. there the Lord profeſſes, that he did <hi>reject the fat of their Peace offerings: Though ye offer me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>burnt offerings, and your meat offerings, I wil not accept them, neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beaſts.</hi> They were careful to offer their fatteſt beaſts in their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings, and will not God regard them? It was in their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offerings that they offered their fat beaſts, and there they were to eat a great part of it themſelves: Indeed the burnt offering was wholly offered unto God, God had all that; but the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104284:44"/>
Peace-offerings, thoſe that did offer it, they did eat a great part of it themſelves: now they were very careful in thoſe offerings that they were to partake of themſelves, to offer fat beaſts: you do not ſee that the holy Ghoſt takes any notice of fat beaſts in their burnt offerings. Now the Note from hence is this, That in thoſe things where men are intereſted themſelves, they will be very careful to have the beſt things. But now the Lord reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the fat beaſts of their Peace-offerings: ſaith God, You were very careful to offer fat beaſts in your Peace-offerings where you may feed your ſelves, but for thoſe offerings wherein I have all, there you are not ſo careful, and therefore I regard them not. The third Scripture is in <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. 7. there they did keep many daies in ſeeking of God, (it is an obſervable Scripture for theſe times) <hi>Speak unto all the People of the Land, and to the Prieſts, ſaying, When ye faſted and mourned in the fifth and ſeventh month, even thoſe ſeventy years; Did ye at all faſt unto me? even unto me?</hi> Mark the phraſe, You faſted in the fifth and ſeventh month, and for ſeventy yeers together, but ſaith the Lord, Did you at all faſt unto me? and then mark how he doubled it, <hi>To me? even unto me?</hi> Noting that when we faſt or pray, or do any thing in the Worſhip of God, we ſhould be ſure to aim at God more than our ſelves, that God may not ſay of us another day, <hi>Do you do it to me, even to me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may ask me this Queſtion, How may I know that I am acted by <hi>ſelf-ends</hi> in holy Duties? for it is a hard thing for one to know ones own heart, when one is acted by principles of <hi>ſelf,</hi> and when we aim at God in holy Duties. Now for that I will give you theſe Notes, to try whether you be acted from your ſelves or no.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is this, If a man loves holy Duties, though he finds no preſent good comes in by them, becauſe they are ſuch things as God requires, and therefore though I get nothing by them, yet this is enough to carry me on, and to carry me on readily, and willingly in the Worſhip of God: thoſe that can delight in Gods Worſhip, even at that time, though they find nothing coming in to themſelves: But now when we find not that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in that we do deſire, we begin to be weary of Worſhip, and ſay, <hi>Why have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt it not?</hi> This
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104284:44"/>
is an Argument that thou art acted by <hi>Self</hi> rather than by God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To know whether we be acted by <hi>ſelf-</hi>ends, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>high</hi> ends for God: Thoſe men that can rejoyce in others that are able to honor God in holy duties more than themſelves, they may have a good evidence to their own ſouls, that when they worſhip God, they are acted by higher ends than <hi>Self,</hi> but now, ſuch as are ſtraightned themſelves, and when they ſee other more enlarged in the Worſhip of God, they rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy them, are griev'd and troubled; know that <hi>Self</hi> is a great ingredient in thoſe duties that thou doeſt perform: if thy heart were raiſed high to God, though thou canſt not thy ſelf be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in holy duties, yet thy ſoul would be glad that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are, though I have a wretched and vile heart of my own, yet bleſſed be God that there are any others that can worſhip God better than I can.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A man that is acted by <hi>Self</hi> in holy duties, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards holy duties but little ſave in time of extremity, in time of fear, or in ſickneſs, or in danger. But now, one that hath <hi>high</hi> ends in holy duties; makes the duties of Gods Worſhip to be the joy of his ſoul in the midſt of his proſperity, and that is an evident ſign that thou art not acted by ſelf ends, but by high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ends, Canſt thou in the midſt of thy abundance ſay, Lord, thou giveſt me all conveniences in this world, and all outward things that I want; but Lord, this is that which is the joy of my ſoul, this is that which makes my life comfortable, even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with thy ſelf, in the duties of thy worſhip, that I have free acceſs unto the Throne of thy Grace to worſhip Thee the Lord, and there meet with thee when I am in the performance of holy duties; O Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt, that this is the thing that makes my life comfortable; It is not that I have a Table furniſhed with variety of diſhes, and that I can have liberty of time to go into company, and ſpend accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as I pleaſe; but Lord, thoſe incomes of thy Spirit that I do find in the duties of thy Worſhip, thoſe are the things that makes my life bleſſed (indeed) unto me? Such a man is able thus to appeal to God, ſurely when he worſhips God, he is acted by high ends, and not by ſelf-ends; And that's the Third thing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104284:45"/>
that is neceſſary for ſanctifying Gods Name in holy Duties, thou muſt have a ſanctified heart, high thoughts of God, and high ends.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, There muſt be much reverence, and much fear when thou comeſt into the preſence of God to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him: thou doeſt not glorifie God as God, except thou doeſt come into his preſence with much fear &amp; reverence of his great Name: Fear in worſhiping of God it is ſo neceſſary, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times in Scripture we find that the very Worſhip of God is called, <hi>The fear of God,</hi> they are put both for one; I might give you divers Scriptures for it: and hence it was that the Name of God was called the <hi>Fear of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>Jacob</hi> did ſwear by the <hi>Fear of his father</hi> Iſaac; becauſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> being a great Worſhiper of God, kept his conſtant times to worſhip God, and worſhiped him in ſuch a conſtant way, as (except <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Daniel)</hi> we do not find mention of the conſtancy of any in the worſhiping of God as we do of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s; for it is ſaid, that he walked but into the fields in the evening as he was wont to do, to Meditate, and to Pray; and therefore God is called, <hi>The fear of</hi> Iſaac. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 7. is a notable Scripture for this drawing nigh to God with fear: <hi>God is greatly to be feared in the Aſſembly of the Saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him:</hi> God is to be had in reverence of all them that are about him, but in the Aſſembly of his Saints he is <hi>greatly to be feared,</hi> he is <hi>daunting terrible</hi> (ſo the words are) in the Aſſembly of the Saints. When thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt nigh to God, thou hadſt need have thy heart poſſeſt with much fear. So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 11. the Kings and Princes of the earth are called upon <hi>to ſerve the Lord with fear:</hi> Let them be never ſo great, yet when they come into Gods preſence, they muſt ſerve him with fear! And ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>In thy fear will I worſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thy holy Temple.</hi> Now this fear of God, it muſt not be a ſervile fear, but a filial and reverential fear; For my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, there may be a great deal of ſlaviſh fear, where God is not honored; there may be fear from ſome terrible apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God, which yet is not owned by God to be this grace of fear: I'le give you two notable Scriptures for that, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 23, 24. compared with the 29. <hi>It came to paſs</hi> (ſaith the text, verſ. 23.) <hi>when ye heard the voyce out of the middeſt of the darkneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:104284:45"/>
               <hi>for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came neer unto me, even al the heads of your Tribes, and your Elders, And ye ſaid, Behold the Lord our God hath ſhewed us his glory and his greatneſs, and we have heard his voyce out of the midſt of the fire: we have ſeen this day, that God doth talk with man, and he liveth; now therefore why ſhould we die? for this great fire will conſume us: If we hear the voyce of the Lord our God any more then we ſhall die.</hi> See with what a terror they were ſtruck at the apprehenſion of Gods appearance; you would think ſurely theſe men did fear God much, but mark in verſ. 29. <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in them that they would fear me.</hi> Why, did they not fear the Lord? Were they not ſtruck with ſuch fear that they thought they ſhould die? they ſaw this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſo terrible, that they were afraid they ſhould die, and yet, <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in them that they would fear me!</hi> So that it appears by this, That one may be ſtruck with much terror in the apprehenſion of Gods preſence, and yet have no true fear of the Name of God: So ſome of you it may be in time of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or danger, are filled with terror; but yet may it not be ſaid preſently after, <hi>O that there were the fear of God in the heart of this man or woman, this youth or maid!</hi> They are terrified ſomtimes, but yet there is not a filial and reverential fear of God in them. And I find in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. (where you have the ſtory of Gods appearing in that moſt terrible manner unto the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> by Fire, by Thunder, and in a mighty Wind) the Prophet was not ſo ſtruck with fear of Gods preſence when he did appear in the mighty wind, or earthquake, or fire, as when God did appear in the <hi>ſmal ſtill voyce,</hi> therfore in verſ. 13. it is ſaid, <hi>And it was ſo when</hi> Elijah <hi>heard it:</hi> that is, the ſoft voyce, (after the fire, and earthquake, and the mighty wind) <hi>that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out &amp; ſtood in the entring in of the Cave and behold there came a voice unto him and ſaid, What doeſt then here</hi> Elijah? Then his heart was more ſtruck with fear where was moſt of Gods preſence (though it was in a ſoft voyce) than when the fire and earthquake did appear: It is a good ſign of a gracious fear, when the ſoul can be ſtruck with more fear from the Word, and from the ſight of God in enjoying of communion with him in his Worſhip, than when God appears in the moſt terrible way of his works; or when there is terror in a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104284:46"/>
through fear of Hell, when God appears as though he would ſend him down preſently to Hell, though God expects to be feared then, but when the ſoul in enjoying communion with God in holy duties, and the more communion he hath with God, the more is he ſtruck with reverence and the fear of God, this is a ſign of ſanctifying fear; and then, Doth the heart ſanctifie the Name of God indeed when it is ſo poſſeſſed with fear in the duties of Worſhip? Now this fear of God ſhould be indeed in the ſoul, and expreſſed outwardly when you are in the Aſſembly, by ſuch reverent carriage in prayer, as if a Heathen ſhould come in, he may ſee Gods Name ſanctified, and may ſay, How great is this God that this People do Worſhip! And in your Families, a reverent carriage, not lying all along in prayer upon your elbows ſleeping, but carrying your ſelves ſo, that if a Heathen ſhould come into your families, they may ſay, O how great is this God that this people do worſhip! And likewiſe this fear it muſt be an abiding fear, not only at that inſtant when you are worſhiping of God, or ſpeaking of any of Gods Titles and Names, but a fear that muſt abide upon your hearts after duty is over; that is, after you are come out from your Cloſets one may perceive the fear of God upon you, and ſo walking all the day long in the fear of God, as it becomes thoſe that have been ſolemnly ſetting themſelves to worſhip Him: Now this fear and reverence is contrary to the ſlightneſs, vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the boldneſs and preſumptuouſneſs that there is in the hearts of men and women when they are worſhiping of God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The duties of Gods Worſhip muſt be full of ſtrength, for they are not ſutable to God elſe, becauſe God is a God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in power and glory himſelf, therefore God cannot endure vain worſhiping. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>I hate vain oblations:</hi> Vanity of ſpirit in worſhiping of God is very hateful to God, it doth defile the Name of God, God is diſhonored by the vanity of mens ſpirits. Now this ſtrength is Three fold:</p>
            <l>Firſt, The ſtrength of Intention.</l>
            <l>Secondly, The ſtrength of Affection.</l>
            <l>Thirdly, The ſtrength of all the Faculties of the ſoul, and the ſtrength of body too, as much as we are able ſhould be put forth in the worſhiping of God.</l>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:104284:46"/>
1 Firſt the ſtrength of Intention. We muſt intend our work as if it were for our lives: If ever we were ſeriouſly Intentive or Attentive about any thing, it muſt be when we are worſhiping of the Name of God. When you are coming to Pray, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent about it. You ſhall ſee ſome when they are going in the ſtreet, when they have much intention about their buſineſſe, their friends meet them, and they never mind them; one may perceive as they are going, That they are mightily intent about their buſineſſe. My Brethren, look upon every duty of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as a great thing which you muſt be intent in your thoughts about, and not give way to the wandring of your thoughts. I have read of one Martyr, that when he was to die, and the fire a kindling, ſaith an Officer, What! will you not ſpeak when you ſee the Fire kindling? Saith he, I am ſpeaking to God: that is, he was praying, and he minded not at all what they were doing. Oh what little things do take our thoughts away from holy duties! When every toy, every feather, every light matter cals them off; Is this to Sanctifie Gods Name? Would not we account it a diſhonorable thing, If we were talking to one about ſerious buſineſſe, and when we are talking, every one that comes by, he ſhould be looking after them, and turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to talk with them? If a Superior be talking with you, he doth expect that you ſhould mind what he ſaith. But when God is ſpeaking to you, and you are ſpeaking to God, every vain thought that comes by, you are turning aſide too: as if it were a greater thing to talk to vain thoughts and temptations, than to the great and glorious God. Therfore now that is the very time that the Devil chuſes for to bring temptations when we are in holy duties, for the Devil knows then he doth two works at once: he doth diſturb us in our duties, and call off our hearts to that that is wicked, and doth agravate our ſin excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. It may be thou wilt not dare to commit that ſin that the temptation doth turn thy thoughts upon, yea but the Devil hath ſpoiled the duty by it. The Lord doth expect that there ſhould be ſtrength of Intention when thou art upon the duty: and there is no time to parlie with temptations now, whatever thoughts come in. The truth is, though they be good thoughts that ſhould come into thy mind, and that time that thou art
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104284:47"/>
Praying, yet if they be not pertinent to the duty thou muſt caſt them away as the temptation of the Devil.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, Can any thing that is good come from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? Certainly that which is materially good, and coming unſeaſonably, may be from the Devil; the Devil may take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by what is in it ſelf materially good, and bring in that in an unſeaſonable time, and ſo he may turn it to evil: As now, when thou art hearing the Word, it may be the Devil thinks he cannot prevail to cauſe thee to have thy heart running about uncleanneſs; yea, but (ſaith the Devil) If I can inject good thoughts, I will put into their minds ſome place of Scripture that is no way pertinent to this, only to divert them: The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil gets much by this; therefore look to it, and know that God expects the ſtrength of thy ſpirit in duty; that is, Strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; thou art worſhiping of God, and therefore thou hadſt need be intent about what thou art doing: Indeed ſometimes before you are aware, evil thoughts will come into your minds, As when a man is keeping of a door, and there is a crowd of people without that would come in, perhaps the man doth open the door for ſome Gentleman that he hears is at the door, but when he opens it for one that is to come in, fourty others will crowd in: And ſo it is many times with the ſoul, that when it opens the door for ſome good thought, a great many evil thoughts will crowd in: Thoſe people might come in if they would ſtay their time, but they ſhould not now come in. So, about worldly buſineſſes, that are not in themſelves unlawful, if they will ſtay the time they may come in; but they muſt be bard out now at this time. There is required ſtrength of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Strength of Affection is required alſo:</hi> That is, The Affections muſt work mightily after God, ſtriving with God in Prayer: If ever thou hadſt a heart inflam'd in any thing, it ſhould be when thou art praying, or attending upon the Word; as the Heathens that worſhiped the Sun, ſometimes I have told you that they would not have a Snail, but a flying Horſe, they would offer that that was ſwift: ſo when we come to the living God, we muſt have living Affections, our Affections boyling; and that will be the way to cure vain thoughts; as the Flies will
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104284:47"/>
not come to the Honey if it be boyling hot, but when it is cold: So if the heart be boyling hot, and the affections a working, it will keep out vain thoughts and temptations: It is a ſign of the breath of life when it is warm, but artificial breath you know it is cold; as now, the breath that comes out of the body that is warm, but the breath that comes out of a pair of bellows that is cold? So the breath of many people in Prayer, it is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be but artificial breath, becauſe it is ſo cold, but if there were ſpiritual life, then it would be warm. Ther muſt be ſtrength of affection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>There muſt be likewiſe the ſtrength of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties:</hi> We ſhould ſtir up whatever we are, or have, or can do to work in Prayer, then the bent of Mind, and Conſcience, and Will, and Affection; yea, and the body ſhould be put to it alſo, and thoſe that worſhip God to purpoſe, they ſpend their bodies in nothing ſo much as in the worſhiping of God. It will be a ſad thing another day when this ſhall be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many, Thou haſt ſpent the ſtrength of thy body upon luſts, but when didſt thou ſpend any ſtrength of the body about any holy duty? What a riddle is this to moſt people, to tell them of ſpending the ſtrength of their bodies in Prayer, or hearing of the Word, or Sanctifying a Sabbath; they think the Sabbath is a time of reſt, I confeſs it is a time of reſt from an outward la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, but it is a time of ſpending ſtrength in a ſpiritual way; and thoſe that ſhall worſhip God a right on the Sabbath, will find it a ſpending of a great deal of ſtrength, and bleſſed is that ſtrength that is ſpent in the Worſhip of God, rather than in the waies of ſin, as moſt ſpend their ſtrength: If God gives thee a heart to ſpend thy ſtrength in His Worſhip, thou maieſt think thus, Lord, thou mighteſt have left me to have ſpent my ſtrength in ſin, how much better is it ſpent in the Worſhiping of thy Name? There is one notable Scripture in <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 2. that ſhews how much ſtrength the Idolaters put forth in the worſhiping of their Idol, they would not do it in a ſlight and vain way, but their hearts were much in that falſe-worſhip, ſaith the text, <hi>And they ſhall ſpread them before the Sun and the Moon, and all the hoſt of Heaven,</hi> (mark now) <hi>whom they have loved, and whom they have ſerved, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have ſought</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:104284:48"/>
               <hi>and whom they have worſhiped:</hi> All theſe are put together in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their Idols; Oh that it could be ſaid ſo of us in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, when we come to worſhip him, whom we have loved, and whom we have ſerved, and after whom we have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and whom we have ſought, and whom we have worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; there is all theſe ſeveral expreſſions to ſhew the ſtrength of their ſpirits in following after their Idols: And that is the Fift thing in our Sanctifying Gods Name.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Sixth is, If thou wilt Sanctifie Gods Name in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, there muſt be an humble frame of ſpirit, worſhip him with much humility of ſoul: <hi>Abraham</hi> did fall upon the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and <hi>duſt and aſhes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath begun to ſpeak unto thee:</hi> yea, we reade of Jeſus Chriſt groveling upon the earth, and the Angels they cover their faces in the preſence of God; and ſo ſhould we be humble when we come before the Lord: there is nothing more abaſes the ſoul of man, than the ſight of God; and the great reaſon of the pride of all mens hearts, is becauſe they never knew God: If thou dideſt but ſee God, thy heart muſt needs be abaſed; And when doth the ſoul ſee God if not when it comes to worſhip him? In <hi>Job,</hi> 42. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye ſeeth thee, wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Now this humility muſt be in the ſenſe of our own meanneſs and baſeneſs. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>This poor man cryed to God:</hi> They are poor ſouls that come into Gods preſence that ſanctifie Gods Name moſt; even thoſe ſouls that do apprehend, and are ſenſible of their own baſeneſs, and meanneſs before God. This poor man cried to God: we uſe to ſay, Give that poor man ſomewhat. It doth affect the heart of God when he ſees much poverty of ſpirit: when we come before Him, we muſt be ſenſible of our infinite dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God. Come as the woman of Canaan, O Lord, <hi>even dogs do receive crums,</hi> and though I be a dog, yet let me receive crums; here is humility of ſpirit. Now this humility of Spirit appears in theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, admiring Gods goodneſs that we do live at this time, and that we have liberty to come before him; we might have been paſt praying and worſhiping of God: think thus, What a mercy is it that we are not baniſhed out of Gods preſence, that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104284:48"/>
the Lord hath not ſpurn'd us out of his ſight as filth, and caſt us out as an everlaſting abhorring, while others have been praying we might have bin yelling under the wrath of the eternal God: Come with this apprehenſion of thy ſelf, and adore Gods goodneſs, that thou art alive to pray, and alive to hear Gods Word. And that it is not only a duty, but a rich priviledg and mercy that God will admit of thee to come into His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Again, it is the goodneſs of God, that He will vouchſafe to look upon the things that are done in Heaven, then if the Lord doth humble Himſelf to behold the things that are done in Heaven, then how doth the Lord humble Himſelf to behold me a poor vile captive as I am in my ſelf; and yet that God ſhould not only behold me before Him, but invite me to come into His preſence; What mercy and goodneſs is this!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our hearts muſt be taken off from the thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of all excellencies in our ſelves; we muſt not come in the pride of our hearts, becauſe we have abilities more than others, what do all thy parts commend thee to God? thou haſt ability in expreſſing of thy ſelf in prayer: why, do thy parts commend thee to God? Whatever is natural in any of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is nothing to God, only that which is from his own Spirit, and therefore thou ſhouldeſt come in thine own thoughts as vile as if thou hadſt no parts and abilities at all. Lay aſide all ſuch apprehenſions of thy ſelf, for the truth is, ſome poor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearted ſinner that can but ſigh out a few groans to God, and is not able to ſpeak two or three ſentences together in a right language, but only breath out his ſoul to God, may be a thouſand thouſand times more acceptable to God than thou that art able to make great Orations when thou comeſt before Him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thou muſt come without any righteouſneſs of thy own, thou muſt never come to Gods preſence but as a poor worm; and if there be any difference that is made between thee and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in outward reſpects, it is nothing to thee: when thou art in the preſence of God, thou art as a baſe vile worm, though thou beeſt a Prince, or Emperor.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thy heart muſt be taken off from what thou doeſt: If
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104284:49"/>
thou haſt any abilities of grace yet thy heart muſt be taken off there, there may be pride not only from ones parts, but it may be God hath given me enlargements in Prayer, the Devil will come in and ſeek to puff up thy heart even becauſe of this. But thy heart muſt be taken off there, and thou muſt deny thy ſelf in all, when thou haſt done the beſt ſervice of all, yet thou muſt conclude, <hi>thou art an unprofitable ſervant;</hi> when thou haſt prayed the beſt, yet riſe with ſhame, and take heed of having thy heart puft up even through the aſſiſtance of the graces of the Spirit of God in holy Duties.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Thou muſt come with a humble reſignation of thy ſelf to God, to be content to wait upon God as long as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to wait upon God in regard of the time, and of the meaſure, and of the manner of the Communication of himſelf, in regard of the means by which he will pleaſe to communicate himſelf, wait upon him; Let me have mercy though at the laſt hour. This now is an humble heart in Prayer; and when we come with ſuch a poverty of ſpirit as this is, we may expect that the Lord will accept of us, Give this poor man ſomewhat, will God ſay: <hi>This poor man cryed, and the Lord heard him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Seventh place, We muſt bring that which is Gods own in ſanctifying Gods Name. I ſpake to this before in the Point of Preparation, <hi>Viz.</hi> That in Gods Worſhip we muſt give him his own. I will only mention it here in the ſanctifying of Gods Name in two regards:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, To give God His own for the matter of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, To give God His own, that is, what comes from the work of His own Spirit, or elſe we do not ſanctifie Gods Name. I will give you one text further about the matter of it, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. if you reade the Chapter, you ſhall find that there is ten times ſaid, that <hi>they did as God had commanded</hi> Moſes: And then in the cloſe of the Chapter, when they had done as God had commanded in His Worſhip; the text ſaith, <hi>Moſes bleſſed them.</hi> That people is a bleſſed people that do obſerve the Worſhip of God as God hath commanded them. But the main thing is, all that we do it muſt be acted by the Spirit of God; it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104284:49"/>
is not enough to have true ſilver and gold, but it muſt have the rigbt ſtamp, or elſe it cannot go for current coyn. And ſo it is not enough that the things that we offer to God in His Worſhip be Gods own, be what we have warrant for out of Gods Word, but it muſt have the ſtamp of the Spirit of God. In the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God there be two Queſtions that He will ask, Firſt, <hi>Who required this at your hands?</hi> But then if you can anſwer thus, Thou O Lord didſt require it: It is well: But then God hath another Queſtion, <hi>Whoſe Image and Superſcription is this?</hi> If thou canſt not give an Anſwer to that, it will be rejected too: Thou muſt be acted by Divine Principles, in all that thou doeſt, there muſt be the ſtamp of the Spirit upon that which is tendered to God, elſe it is nothing. To open this Point fully will ask ſome time.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore I will ſhew you how we may know when our duties are acted by our natural parts rather than by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How we may know whether our duties be acted by natural Conſcience rather than by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, If thou art acted by natural parts, they will not change thy heart: Men that do perform duties by the ſtrength of natural parts, they may be as large as others, and ſpeak to the edification of others, but thoſe duties do never change their hearts; now if thou beeſt acted by the Spirit of God, thou wilt be changed into the very Image of his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, If men are acted by Natural parts, they will not carry them through difficulties and diſcouragements; but now the Spirit of God if thou haſt acted by him, though thou doeſt meet with never ſuch difficulties, and diſcouragements, thou wilt be carried through them all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thou maieſt know it by this, wherein doſt thou account the excellency of a duty to conſiſt, either in thy ſelf or others; Thou performeſt a duty, now (it may be) thy parts do act ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lively, and to thy credit, and yet thy conſcience tells thee that thy heart was ſtraightened: Now canſt thou riſe up with joy becauſe thou haſt thy ends? At another time (perhaps) thy heart is more troubled, and broken: But thou doeſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thy ſelf ſo much, then thou art diſcouraged. And when
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104284:50"/>
thou ſeeſt another perform a duty, if thou ſeeſt but any failing in their expreſſions, thou pitcheſt upon that, and lookeſt upon it as a poor thing; thou art not able to ſee an excellency in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, except there be an excellency of natural parts; but thoſe that have the Spirit of God, they can find the Spirit of God acting in others, though they have not ſuch natural parts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thoſe that are acted by their natural parts, in ſecret they are leſs enlarged, than they are before others a great deal. Their parts act much before others, But what is there between God and their own ſouls?</p>
            <p n="5">5. They that be ſo acted will not be very conſtant, you ſhall have yong ones, that begin to look towards Religion, their parts are a little freſh, and they are mightily enlarged in holy duties, and the thing is good for them to make uſe of their parts; but how ordinary it is, that after a few yeers they are deader and duller than they were before, and have leſs mind to the duties of Gods Worſhip than they had formerly? Were this the Spirit of God, you would find as much ſavour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in them afterwards, as there was at that time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For natural Conſciences, which ſometimes puts men upon acting of duties, and (indeed) is better than meerly natural parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it be only natural Conſcience, it puts upon duties, but gives no ſtrength to do them: but when the Spirit of God puts thee upon a duty, it gives thee ſome ſtrength to perform it, ſome ſtrength whereby thou getteſt ſome Communion with God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be natural Conſcience, it puts upon the duty, but makes not the heart glad of the duty, and to love the duty: but if it be the Spirit of God, it makes thee to delight in it, and to love it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it be natural Conſcience, thou doeſt not by that encreaſe thy communion with God, thou doeſt thy duties as in a round; but now when the Spirit of God puts thee upon holy duties, it is not a task done, but thou findeſt more and more encreaſe in communion with God; thy heart more raiſed to God, and more cloſing with the Lord, and ſo ſtill more and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104284:50"/>
more in the courſe of thy life: I had a little converſe with God at firſt when God began to acquaint my ſoul with His Waies, but through His mercy now I find more communion with Him; and ſo thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> bleſs thy ſelf in God, in that converſe that thou haſt in communion with Him, thou wouldſt not loſe that Communion thou haſt with God in holy duties, for all the world; others have their companions, that they have their communion withal, (much good may do them) but the Lord hath ſhewen me another manner of communion which my ſoul can have with himſelf, in which it hath ſweet ſatisfaction. And thus you have had Seven Particulars for the Sanctifying of the Name of God in Holy Duties.</p>

            <p n="4">4. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Gain, As Natural Conſcience doth give no ſtrength to do the duty, ſo it makes not the duty to be ſtrong to the ſoul; that is thus, Thre's no ſtrength got by the duty; they are not by one duty prepared for another, <hi>But the way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright,</hi> that is, when a gracious heart is in the way of Gods Worſhip, it finds the very duty of the Worſhip of God to be ſtrength to it, and ſo it fits it for another Duty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Further, A Natural Conſcience limits its ſelf, and is bounded; that is, ſo much as will ſerve the turn for its own peace and quiet, ſo much it will do, and no more: But when one is acted by the Spirit of God, one is enlarged without any limits at all, not bounded to ones own peace, for the more peace a gracious heart hath in duty, the more it is enlarged in duty: Now a Natural Conſcience, that puts to duty, and will act you when you want peace, when you are in trouble and fear, but when you are not in trouble and fear, then it puts not on the heart to performance of duty; but the Spirit of God puts
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104284:51"/>
on the Soul to Duty, when there is moſt peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A little will ſerve the turn to ſatisfie natural conſcience, ſo be it they perform the duty, it is enough; but one that is acted by the Spirit of God in duty, muſt meet with much of God or elſe he is not ſatisfied, he goes mourning in the day time if he hath not met with much of God in the morning in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duty, Thus you ſee there is much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the acting of Natural parts and conſcience in duty, and the acting of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>There be only now Two things more for the <hi>Sanctifying of Gods Name in Duty,</hi> and then we are to come to ſhew how we ſhould ſanctifie Gods Name in Duty in reference to the ſeveral Attributes of God. But Firſt for thoſe Two Heads. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Seventh thing is this, When you come to perform holy duties, if you would ſanctifie Gods Name, you muſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate your ſelves to God, there muſt be a reſignation of Soul and Body, Eſtate, Liberty, Name, and all you are, have, or can do unto God: This is to ſanctifie Gods Name, the conſecration of your ſelves unto God: And the profeſſing of this is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duty, when you are to pray, were a very good thing, actually to profeſs your ſelves to be Gods, to profeſs that you do give up all that you are, have, or can do, to God: Lord, I am thy ſervant, take all Faculties of Soul, and Members of Body, improve all, lay out all to thine own praiſe to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt, to bring glory to thy great Name. If every time you came to God in Prayer you did this, this were to ſanctifie your ſelves to God (I ſpake before of a ſanctified heart, but now this is in a profeſſion of your ſelves unto God) do it ſecretly at leaſt in your own thoughts; if you do not every time expreſs it in words, yet in your own thoughts do it; devote yourſelves to God every day. Of admirable uſe it would be, if every day when men and women worſhip God, either in their cloſets or families, they did profeſſedly devote and conſecrate themſelves to God; and ſo likewiſe, every time they come to hear the Word or to receive Sacraments, God would account his Name to be ſanctified in ſuch a work as this is.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:104284:51"/>
8. Laſtly, That that muſt make all up, and without which all the other is nothing; it is, That you muſt tender up al your worſhip in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt; let a man or woman wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God never ſo well, yet when they have done all if they do not tender it up in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, God will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count his Name to be ſanctified; thou muſt by Faith look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus Chriſt as the glorious Mediator that is come into the world, by whom thou haſt acceſs unto the Father: And act thy Faith upon Chriſt, and give up thy Duties into his hand, as the hand of a Mediator to be tender'd up to the Father by him; though thou haſt labored what thou canſt to perform Duty as well as thou art able, yet thou muſt not think to tender it up by thine own hand unto God; but thou muſt tender it up to the Father by the hand of Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, and ſo thou ſhalt ſanctifie the Name of God in holy Duties. We reade in <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 13. that when <hi>Aaron</hi> was to tender up the Incenſe, he was to <hi>put the Incenſe on the fire before the Lord, that the cloud of the Incenſe may cover the Mercy-ſeat that is upon the Teſtimony, that he die not.</hi> Mark, it is as much as his life is worth, whether he doth it, or doth it not. Now Incenſe it is in the New Teſtament called <hi>Prayer,</hi> and ſo in the Old Teſtament too, it was a kind of emblem of Prayer; The offering up of our Prayers, is the offering up of Incenſe to God; and the Mercy-ſeat, it was a Type of Jeſus Chriſt. Now the Incenſe ſhould cover the Mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat; ſo our Prayers muſt go up to Jeſus Chriſt, muſt be upon him, and ſo muſt be accepted by the Father. And as we reade in <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 20. when <hi>Monah</hi> offered a Sacrifice, the text ſaith, that <hi>the Angel of the Lord aſcended in the flame:</hi> This Angel of God here was Jeſus Chriſt, as we might eaſily from this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture make it out, and he aſcends up in the flame from the Altar. Now though we do not offer ſuch kind of Sacrifices with Fire and Incenſe as they did in the time of the Law, yet when we are offering up of our Incenſe; there muſt be a flame of Fervency and Zeal: But that is not enough, together with the flame of the Altar, and the Angel of God, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the great Angel of the new Covenant, (for <hi>Angel</hi> ſignifies nothing but <hi>Meſſenger)</hi> the great Meſſenger that is come into the world, about that great Errend of his, To <hi>Reconcile the World to Himſelf;</hi> He muſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104284:52"/>
aſcend up in the flame, and ſo God will account his Name to be ſanctified, the Name of God is not ſanctified but through Jeſus Chriſt: The acting of our Faith upon Chriſt as Mediator is a ſpecial ingredient to the Sanctifying of Gods Name in holy Duties; as you know the Scripture ſaith, That the Altar doth Sanctifie the Gift offered upon the Altar. Jeſus Chriſt is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar upon whom all our Spiritual Sacrifices are to be offered, and this Altar doth ſanctifie the Gift that is offered upon it, let never ſo great a gift be offered upon any other Altar, it was not accounted holy, nor accepted: So let men by their natural ſtrength or power that they have, offer up the moſt glorious and ſpeciouſeſt Service to God, it is not accepted except it be offered up upon the Altar Jeſus Chriſt: We have an Altar now, not the Communion Table, but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is our Altar, upon whom we are to offer al our Sacrifices, and this Altar muſt ſanctifie the Gift; we can never have our Gift Sanctified, no, nor Gods Name ſanctified in this Gift, except it be offered upon this Altar, and our Faith acted upon Jeſus Chriſt. People little think of this, but of other things, <hi>viz.</hi> That when we worſhip God, we ſhould worſhip him with Fear, and Reverence, and with Humility, and with ſtrength of Intention; ſuch kind of things every one that hath any enlightening of conſcience will think of at ſome time or other; but people do leaſt think of this, which is the greateſt ingredient of all in the Sanctifying of Gods Name in holy duties, that is, To come and tender up all to the Father, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt: How many men and women that have been Profeſſors of Religion twenty or thirty years, and yet not acquainted with this great Myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, To tender up all to God in the Name of his Son. This is that that upon divers occaſions I have ſpoken unto, and am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon every occaſion as I meet with it to ſpeak of, becauſe it is a principal part of the great Myſtery of the Goſpel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, all our duties are rejected of God, and caſt away. Now then, put all theſe Nine things together, and ſee by them what we ought to do that we may ſanctifie the Name of God in holy Duties.</p>
            <p>But there is ſomething further to be ſpoken that may help you to ſanctifie Gods Name in holy duties, and that is, Several
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104284:52"/>
workings of heart, ſutable to the ſeveral Attributes of God, for that is to ſanctifie Gods Name, to have the duty to be ſuch as is ſome way ſutable to ſuch a God as we are now worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Now then let us conſider what the Scripture ſaith of God, and then let us ſee what ſutable diſpoſitions we ſhould have in us unto thoſe things that the Scripture ſaith of God:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, You know the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> in <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. Then preſently Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That he that worſhips him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit;</hi> that is, there muſt be a ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our worſhip to what God is: Is God a Spirit? then all that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit and Truth; that is thus, When I am to go to worſhip God, I muſt conſider of him, as he is an infinite and glorious Spirit; well then, ſurely bodily worſhip is not ſufficient for me: Though I do kneel down in prayer, or do come and preſent my body to hear the Word, or my body to receive the Sacrament, this is not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God as a Spirit: If indeed that our God were as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that were corporeal, then it were another matter, then bodily worſhip would ſerve the turn; but God being a Spirit, he muſt have Spiritual Worſhip, therefore <hi>my ſoul, and all that is within me, magnifie his Name:</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> my <hi>Soul</hi> magnifie his Name, not my lips only, but my ſoul: The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. ſaith, that <hi>bodily exerciſe profits little;</hi> it is no great matter for the body, God looks but very little at bodily exerciſe; but it is godlineſs that is profitable, it is the work of the Spirit; when we come to pray, we muſt pray in the Spirit; that is, we muſt pray with our ſouls, we muſt powr forth our ſouls before God, and when we come to hear, our hearts muſt not go after our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, we muſt ſet our hearts to what we hear, we muſt hear with our hearts as well as with our ears, our ſouls muſt be at work in hearing of the Word; when you hear, it is not enough for you to come and ſit in a Pew, and have the ſound of a mans voice in your ears, but your ſouls muſt be at work: And ſo when you come to receive the Sacrament, your ſouls muſt feed upon Jeſus Chriſt: Bodily-worſhip without Soul-worſhip is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſoul-worſhip may be accepted without bodily-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; therefore it is the Soul that God doth principally look
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104284:53"/>
at in holy duties: If you be not able to worſhip God in your bodies, you may worſhip him in your ſouls, and God regards that bodily exerciſe in holy duties is little worth, ſomewhat it may be worth, I confeſs ſometime bodily exerciſe may further the ſoul, as a reverend carriage of the body, and the like, but it is nothing in compariſon, the great work is the work of the ſoul, for God is a Spirit, and muſt be worſhiped in Spirit. And God is ſaid to be a Spirit, not only in that he is not of ſo thick a Capital ſubſtance, but it notes the ſimplicity of God, he is without any compoſition, whatſoever is in God, is God Himſelf, He is abſolutely One, there are not divers things in God; now then, thoſe that come to worſhip Him, muſt worſhip Him in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in Truth; that is, there muſt not be a heart and a heart, there muſt not be a compounded heart, but you muſt bring ſimple hearts before God, without any compoſition of droſs in your ſelves, and of any kind of falſneſs, but in the ſimplicity of your hearts you muſt come to worſhip God, and thus you ſhall worſhip him with ſuch worſhip as is ſome way ſutable to him as he is a ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Further conſider, God as he is an eternal God, what ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition doth this require of me when I am to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God as an eternal Being? it requires this only, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy heart muſt be taken off from all temporal good things, and ſet upon that eternal good, thou mayeſt indeed deſire theſe outward good things but in order to thy eternal good.</p>
            <p>Then further, Thou art worſhiping an eternal God: hence then, whatſoever ſin thou doeſt confeſs, although committed 20. or 40. yeers ago, thou muſt look upon it as if it were now preſently committed, and be humbled as much before the Lord as if it were now committed at this preſent; You will ſay, Why ſo? Becauſe God is an Eternal God? Yes: For if I underſtand Gods Eternity, I know that there is no ſucceſſion in Gods Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; therefore the ſins that I committed in my youth, if I come to confeſs them, they are before God as if they were now a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in regard of time, and therefore I muſt (as much as I can) look ſo upon them, and be humbled for them as if they were ſins lately committed. Many people are troubled for their ſins the very day after they commit them, but a little time wears
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104284:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
off their trouble: but if you did conſider that you had to deal with an eternal God, then you would look upon your ſins though a long time ſince committed as if they were but now done.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe there will be this required from the conſideration of Gods eternity, You muſt come with ſuch a diſpoſition of heart as not to think much, though what you deſired be deferred and not granted in your time when you would have it. For if there be no time that alters with God, but a thouſand yeers are with God as one day, then that that we account long before its done, it is nothing with God; and therefore we muſt have our hearts ſo work towards God as towards an Eternal God, as one with whom there is no alteration of time at all, with whom there is no ſucceſſion of time. If we come to a man and ſeek any thing of him, if he doth not anſwer us preſently, we will think that he will forget it, and other things will come into his mind: but when we come to worſhip God, we muſt look upon him as an Eternal Being, and that time alters nothing with him: Thus underſtanding God in a right way wil much help us in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to Sanctifie his Name. We cannot Sanctifie Gods Name, without knowing his Name, without having ſerious thoughts about his Name; and getting our hearts to work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Look upon God when you come to Worſhip Him in His comprehenſible Being: that is, as a God that fils all places, His being is real in the room that we are praying in, the place that we are meeting in, as it is in Heaven. Now then when we come to worſhip Him, we muſt conſider that that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite glorious Being ſtands before us, looks upon us, is at our elbow; and therefore eſpecially when you worſhip in ſecret conſider this, it is good to conſider it when you are with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but eſpecially (I ſay) conſider it when you are in ſecret, and know that when you are moſt private, you have one that looks on you, and takes notice of you, who is more than if you had ten hundred thouſand witneſſes ſtanding by you, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon you: For it is the Lord that ſtands by you, and ſees your behavior, ſees what you do in your worſhiping of Him; take heed therefore that there be nothing done by you that is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104284:54"/>
unbeſeeming the preſence of ſuch a God as the Lord is: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſome of you were praying, and there were ſome god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able Miniſter ſtood neer you, it would be ſome means to ſtir up your hearts to mind what you did: but now the Lord He is not in the next room only, but in the ſame room, and ſtands by you: Let there be nothing done therefore unbeſeeming the preſence of that infinite holy God that ſtands by you; and hold this truth forth, The Lord is preſent with me, I acknowledg it, and I own it, and therefore I carry my ſelf thus, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would witneſs to Angels and Men, that I do acknowledg that the Lord is preſent with me in this duty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Conſider God is an unchangable God, immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. That is another Attribute of God; He is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore our hearts muſt be taken off from theſe mutable things, and ſet upon God as that unchangable good.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We muſt be humbled for our fickleneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtantneſs; there is no ſhadow of change in God, and there is no ſhadow of conſtancy in us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When we come into the preſence of a God who is unchangable, then we ſhould look upon God as being the ſame now that ever He was heretofore; He hath as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt ſin now as ever he had, and that God that hath done ſuch great things for his Church in former times, is the ſame God to do good to His people as ever he was. And make uſe of this; When you reade the Word, and there find how God hath made Himſelf appear to be glorious for His people; and now every time I am to worſhip God, I ſhould think that I am to deal with God that is the ſame that ever he was, a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, and gracious, and juſt, and powerful as ever he was, and ſo my heart is to work towards him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fiftly, When I am to Worſhip God, I am to look upon Him as the Living God, as that God that hath life in Himſelf, and gives life unto his Creatures.</p>
            <p>Then what ſutable behavior doth become me? I muſt come before His preſence with fear; <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into his hands that is the living God;</hi> that hath my life under his feet, He
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104284:54"/>
hath the abſolute diſpoſe of my preſent and eternal condition, He gave me my life, he hath preſerved my life, and ſo may take it away when he pleaſes, and bring death, eternal death unto me. Theſe things may marvelouſly help your meditation when you are to come before Him, you who are barren in your meditations, go over the Attributes of God thus, and conſider what you may be able to draw from thence. God, He is the living God: What behavior then doth beſeem me towards this living God? Oh let me be afraid leſt my ſoul depart from the living God: Let me bring a living Service to Him, I muſt not bring a dead heart; let me take heed how I come before the living God with a dead heart, and with a dead ſervice, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice that which is dead before it comes, it's like a carrion that lies dead in the ditch. Oh let us be humbled for our dead hearts, and dead ſacrifices; it is a living God that I am wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping, and therefore I muſt pray, <hi>Lord turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken my heart in thy Law, Pſal.</hi> 119. 37. Remember when thou comeſt to worſhip, that thou come with a quikned heart, for thou haſt to deal with a living God: A man or woman that is of an active ſpirit, cannot endure a dull and heavy ſervant in the family; but the Lord is a pure act, and nothing elſe but act, and therefore he doth expect that all his people ſhould have quick, active, and lively ſpirits.</p>
            <p n="6">6, When you come to worſhip God; you are to look upon Him as Almighty. And ſo are, Firſt,</p>
            <p>To fear his great Power when you come before Him. And Secondly:</p>
            <p>Then you are not to be diſcouraged by any difficulties. I come to ſeek for ſome great thing, and I come to ſeek to a great God, that hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, and infinitely more power than there is in all creatures in Heaven and Earth; I am praying to a God that can create peace, create help: My condition cannot be ſo deſperate, but this Infinite Almighty God is able to help me: Let me make him the object of my faith as he is ſo infinitely Almighty: What a full object of faith is this God that hath all power in Him? Let me therefore come to him as a ſtrong Tower; <hi>Run to the Name of God as a ſtrong Tower,</hi> that can help in all ſtraights whatſoever. There would be much
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104284:55"/>
drawing forth of our Faith: if we could preſent the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us as an infinite Almighty God: when we ſee outward helps and means neer at hand, then we can beleeve that we may have ſome ſuccour from him, but when all outward helps and means fail then we are diſcouraged; we do not ſanctifie Gods Name, but we rather take this Name of God in vain, when as our hearts are diſcouraged with any difficulties; now the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that all his Children that come to worſhip him, ſhould worſhip him as the Almighty God, and ſo have their hearts working towards him; there would be mighty workings of Spirit towards God, if we ſaw him by the eye of Faith as well as Reaſon.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Look upon God as an Omniſcient God, as a God infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely underſtanding all things. Now what doth this call for?</p>
            <p>Firſt, If God be a God of infinite underſtanding, then let not me bring a blind Sacrifice to God, then let not me bring an ignorant heart to God; this is the excellency of an underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding creature to know the rule and end of its own Actions; now thou comeſt to worſhip an infinite God, of infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, then know the rule of what you do, and know the end of what you do, and come with underſtanding in His preſence.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If He be ſo underſtanding, come with a free open heart, to open whatſoever is in thine heart to God; take heed of keeping any ſecret reſolutions in thine own heart, God knows thee, and can tell how to find thee out; God knows all that is in thine heart before; all the ſecret baſeneſs that is in thine heart, the Lord doth underſtand it, the Lords eye is a piercing eye, He ſees thorow and thorow thy heart. It's a vain thing for thee to come and conceal any thing before Him.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, If God underſtand a mans heart, what need he come and confeſs?</p>
            <p>Yes: He requires it as thy duty that thou ſhouldeſt come and open all before him: In ſpight of thy heart thou canſt not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any thing from the Lords eyes; but the Lord will ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou beeſt willing of thy ſelf that He ſhould underſtand al:
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104284:55"/>
God doth not require us to come and confeſs our ſins, that ſo he might know that which he knew not before, but for this end, That there might be a teſtimony, that thou art willing that he ſhould know all that is in thy heart; therefore now when thou comeſt to worſhip him, ranſack every corner of thy heart, and confeſs all before the Lord, and give glory to his Name, as that God that is an All-ſeeing God, that knows all the windings and turnings of thy heart: Now meditate of theſe things that be preſented to thee, and it will be a mighty means to help thee to ſanctifie his Name.</p>
            <p n="8">8. God is a God of infinite Wiſdom, therefore when we come to worſhip God, let us be aſhamed of our folly: When thou comeſt to have to deal with God, look upon him as a God of infinite Wiſdom, and I ſay be thou aſhamed of thy folly then, and do thou exerciſe the grace of wiſdom too when thou comeſt to God; that is, by propounding right ends (of which we ſpake before) That is one part of wiſdom to have right ends, and right means towards thoſe ends, ſo that the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wiſdom of God when we come to worſhip him will further us to ſanctifie his Name.</p>
            <p>And further; This is to Sanctifie Gods Wiſdom, when thou comeſt into Gods preſence, in thy greateſt ſtraights, deny thy own wiſdom, come with a reſolution to be guided by the Wiſdom of God, in this manner, Lord, I know not how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my ſteps, there is much folly and vanity in my heart, but thou art a God of infinite Wiſdom, I come to thee for direction, and I profeſs here, I am willing to give up my whol Soul to be guided by thy wiſdom. If every time we come to Worſhip God we came thus; Oh Lord, whatſoever our thoughts have been heretofore, yet if thou ſhalt but reveal thy mind to us, we will hearken to thee, Lord, we beleeve that thy Wiſdom it is thy Self, and therefore we profeſs to give up our ſelves to thy Wiſdom. Now this is to Sanctifie the Name of God.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Conſider the holineſs of God; God is a God infinitely pure from all ſin, and therefore when we come to Worſhip God, we muſt be aſhamed of our holineſs, as the Prophet in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6, when he heard the Seraphins cry, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hoſts,</hi> he fals down and ſaith, <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:104284:56"/>
               <hi>am a man of unclean lips.</hi> And is God a holy God? Then let me take heed when I come before Him, that I bring not with me a love to any ſin, for the Lord hates it, and let me take heed that I do not caſt dirt in the very face of Gods Holineſs, but give up my ſoul to be rul'd wholly by Him:</p>
            <p>And labor that there may be a ſutableneſs between the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of thy heart, and of the infinite God. Now this is to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie Gods Name, when the conſideration of this Attribute of God hath ſuch effect upon my heart, that I labor upon this to come with a ſutable heart before God.</p>
            <p n="10">10. When thou comeſt before God, Conſider that thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to a merciful God: And what ſhould this work?</p>
            <p>Firſt, It ſhould make me come joyfully into His preſence, as a God that is willing to do good to his poor creatures that are in miſery.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It ſhould make me to come with a heart ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the need of this mercy; O Lord, I have had my heart let out to other vain things heretofore, but now Lord, thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it is that my ſoul comes for, as that wherein my chief and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good conſiſts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It ſhould make me come with expectation of great things from God; do not come unto God as unto an empty Vine, but as unto a full Vine, and the more thy faith is raiſed to expect great things from God, the more acceptable art thou to God: Certainly the higher any ones faith is raiſed when they come into his preſence, to expect the greateſt things, the more acceptable. It is otherwiſe with God than men, if you come to men to beg a little thing, you may be welcome, but if you come to ask a great matter, they will look askew upon you: but the truth is, the greater the things are that we come to God for, the more welcome are we into Gods preſence; and thoſe that are acquainted with God they know it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come the more fully. When they come to ask Jeſus Chriſt himſelf and his Spirit that is more worth than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds, they come with more freedom of Spirit than when they come to ask their healths, and the like.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It will be likewiſe another means of ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Attribute of God; when thou comeſt to him: If thou
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104284:56"/>
doeſt come with a merciful heart towards thy brethren: Take heed whenſoever you come to worſhip God, that you come not with a rugged and cruel heart towards any of your brethren; therefore you find that Chriſt laies this upon you, in teaching how to pray, you moſt ſay, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive our brethren that treſpaſs againſt us:</hi> And you find it repeated again, If you forgive, then your Heavenly Father will forgive, and not otherwiſe. As if Chriſt ſhould ſay, When you come to beg mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, be ſure you bring merciful hearts.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is a good way to ſanctifie the Name of God in this Attribute, for the ſoul to be ſolicitous with it ſelf: What is that that will hinder me from the mercy of God, and let me avoid it? It is otherwiſe, a taking of the Name of God in vain, for me to come to profeſs what need I have of Gods mercy, and yet for al that, never regard to avoid thoſe things that may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the work of his Grace upon me</p>
            <p n="11">11. Conſider the <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> (that's another Attribute) Conſider that thou haſt to deal with an Infinite, Righteous and Juſt God: Do not think that if thou beeſt a Beleever, that thou haſt nothing to do with the Juſtice of God, for certainly thou art to ſanctifie the Juſtice of God.</p>
            <p>Now you will ſay, <hi>How ſhould a Beleever ſanctifie the Juſtice of God?</hi> Thus:</p>
            <p>Firſt, He ſhould be apprehenſive and ſenſible, how by ſin he hath put himſelf under Juſtice, and deſerved the ſtroke of Juſtice to be upon him to eternity; he ſhould conſider what he is in himſelf: It's true, that Jeſus Chriſt hath come between a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul and the Juſtice of the Father, and hath taken the ſtroke of Juſtice upon himſelf: yea, but though he hath done it it doth not hinder but that thou ſhouldſt be apprehenſive of what thou haſt deſerved thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is a ſpecial thing in the ſanctifying of the Juſtice of God: When we come before him we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that we have to deal with an infinite juſt God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to dare to come but through a Mediator; Here you have the reaſon why we muſt tender up all in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe when we are to come before God, we are to ſanctifie the Name of his Juſtice: For thee to think thus, I have
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104284:57"/>
ſinned, and God is merciful; and I will go and pray to him that he might be merciful, and there's an end. Is this all? Oh no, God requires the ſanctifying of his Juſtice, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that doth ſanctifie his Juſtice ſo much as this, That when a poor creature ſees the infinite diſtance that ſin hath made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that infinite God and it, it ſees that though ſin, it hath made its ſelf liable to Juſtice; and when it ſees that there is an abſolute neceſſity that infinit Juſtice muſt have ſatisfaction, and thinks the ſinner, If it comes to me that I muſt ſatisfie the Juſtice of God I am never able to do it, but there is a Mediator, and therefore I'le fly to him, and by Faith tender up to the Father all the merits of his Son as a full ſatisfaction to his infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: When thou comeſt thus before the Lord, thou Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieſt his Name indeed. Many think that when they come to pray, they ſhould look upon Gods Grace, and Mercy, and not upon his Juſtice; but thou muſt look upon both.</p>
            <p>Another Attribute, it is Gods Faithfulneſs: Conſider thou haſt to deal with a God of infinite Truth, and Faithfulneſs, and therefore look upon him as an object of thy Faith to reſt upon, And likewiſe thou muſt bring a faithful heart ſutable ſome way to this Faithfulneſs of God, that is, a heart faithful with him, to keep within the Covenant that thou haſt entered into and to perform all the Vows that thou makeſt with God; Remember thou haſt to deal with a Faithful God, and as the Lord delights to manifeſt his Righteouſneſs to poor Creatures that ſeek His face; ſo this God doth expect that thou ſhouldeſt be faithful in all the Covenants that thou doeſt make with Him, and this is to ſanctifie Gods Name.</p>
            <p>Now then put all theſe Attributes of God together, and there you have his Glory, the infinitneſs of his Glory. The ſhine and luſtre of all the Attributes together is Gods Glory. I have then to deal with a glorious God, and let me labor to perform ſuch ſervices as may have a ſpiritual Glory upon them, that ſome Image of the Divine Luſtre that there is in God may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſervices; and let me look for glorious things ſeeing I have to deal with ſuch a glorious God.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, Here is a great deal of do in ſerving of God, how much is here that we muſt do?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:104284:57"/>
I appeal to any gratious heart, What canſt thou want of any of theſe, or what wouldeſt thou want? Doeſt thou ſay, Her's a great deal? Can there be too much to make thee happy? Theſe things are not only thy duty, but thy happineſs, glory and excellency conſiſts in them: If any one ſhould bring you a great many Jewels and Pearls, would you ſay, Here's a great deal ado? Oh no, the more the merrier. So ſay I, this one meditatiion would take off the thoughts of <hi>a deal,</hi> for in all theſe my happineſs conſiſts, and the more I have of theſe, the more ſhall I enjoy of God, the more happy ſhall I be both here and for ever.</p>
            <p>Now I had thought to have given you ſome Reaſons why the Name of God muſt be ſanctified; only I beſeech you by all that hath been ſaid go away with this thought, What little cauſe is there that any of us ſhould reſt upon any of our duties; If this be required of us thus to ſanctifie the Name of God in duty, (I ſay) we have little cauſe any of us to reſt on any duties that we perform. There are many poor creatures that have no other Saviors to reſt upon but their Prayers, and coming to Church, and taking the Communion; Now if in all theſe the Lord expects that thou ſhouldſt thus ſanctifie his Name: Thou haſt little cauſe to reſt upon any thing that thou haſt done, thou haſt cauſe rather to go alone and mourn for taking the Name of God in vain in the duties of his Worſhip: Reſt not in any of your performances; labor to perform duties as well as you can, but when you have done, know that you are unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervants after all, and renounce all as in the point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and reſt upon ſomething elſe, otherwiſe you are undone for ever.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE are coming now to the concluſion of this great Argument of ſanctifying Gods Name in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the general. God expects that we ſhould all in our drawings neer to Him in the duties of worſhip, ſanctifie His Name. Now we are to conſider of divers Reaſons why God will be Sanctified in all the duties of His Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Reaſon is this, It is the very Nature of God to Will Himſelf the laſt end, and all other things to work ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the lifting up of Himſelf as the laſt end: (I ſay) it is as eſſential to Him as any thing, for Him to will Himſelf as the higheſt end, and that all things ſhould work ſo as to be ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto that Glory of His for the furtherance of it: God ſhould ceaſe to be God, if ſo be He ſhould not will Himſelf as the higheſt end, and ſo will that all things that have any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould ſome way or other work for Himſelf: This is the very nature of God. It is that which I conceive the very nature of Gods Holineſs conſiſts in, the willing Himſelf as the laſt end and ſo to work al things as ſutable unto His own infinit Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. Now as this is Gods holineſs, ſo it is the holineſs that God requires in His Creatures (that are capable of holineſs) that they ſhould will Him as the laſt end, and all things ſutable to that infinite Excellency of His. Now if this be the nature of God, and this be His holineſs, then certainly it muſt needs be a neceſſary duty in al thoſe that would have co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with God and would honor God, to wil as God himſelf doth will, that is, that all things ſhould work ſutable to the infinite Excellency of God, that God may attain the Glory of His infinite Excellency, and this makes it to be a neceſſarie dutie, that when we come to Worſhip Him we ſhould Sanctifie
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104284:58"/>
His Name: So that the firſt reaſon is taken from the very nature of God, it is the very being of God that all things ſhould work to Himſelf, and in ſuch a ſutable way as to lift up His Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, We muſt ſanctifie God in the duties of His Worſhip, becauſe it is the ſpecial glory that God hath in the world, to be actively honored; for his paſſive glory, that is, to be glorified in a paſſive way, that he hath in Hell, but the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial glory that God would have, it is, that he might be glorified actively: Now there is no ſuch way of glorifying the Name of God actively, as by worſhiping of him in a holy manner, and therefore God ſtands much upon this, That when we come to worſhip him we ſanctifie his Name; for ſaith God, If I be not ſanctified in my Worſhip, what active glory have I in the world? it is the ſpecial active Glory that God hath in the world, the ſanctifying of his Name in the duties of his Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, That which we have intimated before, That the duties of Gods Worſhip are the moſt precious things, the ſpecial conveyances of the choice mercies that he intends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on his Saints, and therefore though he loſes his Glory in any thing elſe, he would not loſe it in that wherein he doth eſpecially convey his mercy and goodneſs to his people. But that we ſpake too in ſhewing how we draw nigh to God in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties, and it may well come in here again as an Argument why we ſhould ſanctifie Gods Name.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A Fourth Reaſon is this, Becauſe there is no way for us to be fitted for the receiving of mercy from God through thoſe duties of Worſhip, but by our ſanctifying of Gods Name; when thou comeſt at any time to worſhip God, what wouldeſt thou have? there it ſome communion that thou wouldeſt enjoy with God, now there is no way to make thee a fit ſubject of mercy, or capable of the enjoying of Communion with God, but by ſuch a behavior of ſoul as this is that hath been ſpoken of, To ſanctifie the Name of God; thou wouldeſt be loth to loſe thoſe duties of worſhip that thou doeſt perform, therefore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee to ſanctifie his Name leſt thou doeſt loſe all, for 'tis this that makes thee the only capable ſubject of what good is to be had there.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:104284:59"/>
5. We muſt ſanctifie Gods Name in holy Duties, becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhould certainly never hold out in Duties, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and come to nothing; now God would be worſhiped ſo by his creatures, as to be conſtantly worſhiped, he would have thoſe that do worſhip him, to worſhip him alwaies, to worſhip him for ever, and he would have this Worſhip that we perform to him, but to be the begining of that eternal Worſhip that he ſhall have from us in Heaven. And ſo the Saints do Worſhip God now, the Worſhip which they perform, it is but as the beginning of that Worſhip that hereafter in Heaven they ſhall tender up to God, though there may be ſome difference in it, as there our prayers will be turned into praiſes, and it will not be in ſuch outward Ordinances as now we worſhip God in, there will be no Preaching, nor Sacraments; yet notwithſtanding, the Soul worſhip that is now, will be in effect the ſame as it ſhall be in Heaven. God would have us ſo to worſhip him as to continue to worſhip him: Now (I ſay) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nleſs his Name b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſanctified in our worſhiping of him, we will certainly fall off: and the truth is, This is the very ground of all Apoſtacie in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites; Some that have been very forward in the worſhiping of God when they were young ones, and afterwards they have fallen off, they were wont conſtantly in their families, and in ſecret in their chambers to be worſhiping of God, and they accounted it the very joy of their lives for the preſent to be worſhiping of God; but it is not ſo with them now as it was: yea, they are fallen off (it may be) from their very profeſſion of Religion, and turn'd looſe; And now to be in vain company, to drink or play, is better to them than any Service of Worſhip of God, they prize more to be in company with their ſports, than to hear a Sermon, or to be in Communion with the People of God in Prayer: Heretofore they would not have changed one ſhort time of private Communion with God, for the enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a great deal of pleaſures and content in the world; but now it is otherwiſe with them. How comes it to paſs that theſe are apoſtatized thus from God? Surely this is the ground of it, That they did not ſanctifie Gods Name in holy Duties, at the moſt it was but a work of conſcience that put them upon them, and they had but ſome flaſhes, there was no real Sanctification
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104284:59"/>
of their hearts whereby they did ſanctifie the Name of God in holy duties, and upon this it is that they have left off. This I dare ſay, That there was never any ſoul that did know what it was to ſanctifie Gods Name in worſhip, that ever was weary of worſhiping God.</p>
            <p>It may be ſome of you may ſay, We have hard that there is much required in ſanctifying Gods Name in duties, and that is the only way to weary the ſoul, and to make it fall off; Oh no, (as we ſaid the laſt day) there is not any one thing that hath been opened for the ſanctifiing of Gods Name in duties that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious heart can tell how to miſs, and the more we do ſanctifie His Name, the more we ſhall be in love with worſhip. For it is from hence that thoſe that ſanctifie Gods Name in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will hold out, becauſe they will find the ſweetneſs of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they will meet with God in holy duties, and ſo they come to be encouraged in worſhip, but as for others who do worſhip God in a formal way, their worſhip will prove to be tedious to them, for they perform the duties, but do not find God in the duties in that ſpiritual way as the Saints do; If they think they meet with God, it is but an imagination rather than any real meeting with him; they do not find the influence of God in their ſouls in holy duties, ſo as thoſe do that ſanctifie Gods Name in holy duties; here then you ſee the Reaſons why we are to ſanctifie Gods Name in holy duties.</p>
            <p>Now then for the Application of all this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If all this which you have be required of us for the ſanctifying of Gods Name: Hence we ſee how little cauſe we have to reſt upon any duty of worſhip that we do perform, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the duties of worſhip that we perform are no ſuch things as are fit to be reſted upon for life and for ſalvation, and yet for the moſt part there is ſcarce any thing that people have to reſt upon, or to tender up to God for acceptation to eternal life but only their prayers, and their coming to hear, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Communion, and ſuch duties that they perform; this is al they have to tender up for life and for ſalvation; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may ſometimes ſpeak of Chriſt, but the truth is that which their hearts reſt upon for acceptation to eternal life is this. And is it but this? It is a weak prop, a rotten reed that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104284:60"/>
thou haſt to reſt upon; Let the duties of Worſhip be performed never ſo well; Suppoſe we did ſanctifie Gods Name to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt that is poſſible for any creature to do in this world, yet ſuch duties are not to be reſted upon: <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and the Apoſtles, the moſt holy men that ever did preform duties in the moſt holy manner, yet wo to them if they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reſt upon but their duties; Conſider therefore of this, That what thou muſt reſt upon for acceptation to Eternal life, it muſt be that which muſt have ſo much worth in it, as muſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for all thy ſins that formerly thou haſt committed, yea, and for all the ſins that ever thou ſhalt commit. Now I appeal unto any ones conſcience, Is that which thou performeſt, is Prayer, or receiving the Sacrament, or hearing of the Word, ſuch a work as in thy conſcience thou canſt think, it hath ſo much worth in it, as to ſatisfie God for all the ſins that ever thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or ſhalt commit? I am preſwaded if people that have reſted upon duties heretofore, would but ſeriouſly have this thought in their minds, That I muſt reſt upon nothing for my accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for life and ſalvation, but that that muſt have ſuch worth in it, as to ſatisfie God for all my ſins that ever have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or ſhall be committed; this would take them off for ever from reſting in duties. Yea, and it muſt be ſuch as muſt be the object of the Infinite holineſs of God to take content in, Surely the duties that we perform are no ſuch duties to reſt upon: the truth is, If we would ſeriouſly conſider what they are, at they come from us, we would even abhor our ſelves in duſt and aſhes, and account of them as the Prophet ſpeaks of his own righteouſneſs, as menſtruous cloathes, they are ſuch as if God ſhould deal with us, as juſtly he may do, he might caſt them and us to the dogs, for they are (as the Prophet ſaith) <hi>torn and rent ſacrifices;</hi> now if a man in the time of the Law ſhould bring to the Lord a Sacrifice that was all torn and rent before he brought it, would ſuch a ſacrifice have been accepted? All the duties we preform as they come from us they are ſuch; we reade in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 31. concerning ſuch things as were torn and rent, that they ſhould caſt them to the dogs, <hi>Ye ſhall be holy men unto me</hi> (ſaith he, verſe ult) <hi>neither ſhall ye eat any fleſh that is torn of beaſts in the field, ye ſhall caſt it to the dogs, becauſe ye are</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:104284:60"/>
               <hi>holy men unto me.</hi> Muſt the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> manifeſt their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this, That they muſt eat nothing torn by beaſts, but caſt it unto dogs? Or was the holineſs of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſuch, as God required them, that they muſt eat nothing that was torn by beaſts? What then is the holineſs of the infinite God? Our ſervices that we perform are of themſelves ſuch as are torn by our beaſtly luſts many times: How many are there that bring Sacrifices to God that are as Carrion that Swine have been tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring beforehand? and yet theſe are the Sacrifices that they bring to God, and not only think that God ſhould accept of them, but they do reſt upon them for their acceptation to eternal life. How infinitely are theſe people miſtaken! how little do they know of God, or of the way of acceptation to eternal life! That is the firſt Uſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If all this be required for the Sanctifying of Gods Name in Duties, that we cannot perform the Duties of Worſhip without this behavior of Soul; Hence we ſee that the work of Religion is a hard and difficult work to fleſh and blood. A main work of Religion is, the work of <hi>worſhiping of God;</hi> for indeed, thoſe that are not Religious and Godly, they never worſhip God to any purpoſe: then we come to worſhip God when we begin to be Religious and godly. Now it muſt needs be a buſie work to be a religious and a godly man, becauſe there is ſo much required in the Sanctifying of Gods Name in holy duties: Many people think it a very eaſie matter to worſhip God, and the worſhip that they tender up to God is an eaſie matter, there is little in it. If it were nothing elſe to worſhip God but meerly to go and ſay a few Prayers, and come and hear a Sermon, and take a piece of Bread and Wine, then it were the eaſieſt matter in the world to come and worſhip God; but there is more required in the Duties of Gods Worſhip than thou haſt been acquainted with, there is a power of godlineſs in it. That Text of Scripture is a very famous one, that ſhews the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that there is in the Worſhip of God, and how men are miſtaken in thinking it ſuch an eaſie and ſlight matter to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God; it is in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 16. 19. where <hi>Joſhua</hi> doth call upon the people to worſhip God, and they came off preſently, and ſaid, They would worſhip him (ſo you ſhall find them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104284:61"/>
verſe 16.) But mark what the Text ſaith in verſe 19. <hi>And</hi> Joſhua <hi>ſaid unto the People, Ye cannot ſerve the Lord, for he is an holy God, he is a jealous God, and he will not forgive your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and your ſins.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, You think it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſerve the Lord, and that it is an eaſie matter to ſerve him, you think to put off God with any thing: Alas you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve the Lord, for he is a holy God, and is a jealous God, and you muſt have other manner of hearts than yet you have, and you muſt underſtand his Worſhip in another manner than yet you do: The Lord will be ſanctified in thoſe that draw nigh him, and therefore until you underſtand God, and his waies and Worſhip, you cannot ſerve the Lord. Know, that the work of Religion is a very hard and difficult work, for it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all this, and therefore the ſoul had need to be very diligent and laborious that would come to Worſhip God in a right way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hence it is an Uſe of humiliation to us all, even to the beſt of us; Oh how little! how little hath the beſt of us all ſanctified the Name of God! how far have we all come ſhort of the ſanctifying of Gods Name in holy Duties! And when we look abroad in the world, and ſee what poor ſervice God hath generally from the Men and Women of the Earth, it ſhould make our hearts bleed within us: Where almoſt is the man or woman that according to that text in <hi>Iſaiah, ſtirs up himſelf to take hold on God?</hi> And I verily beleeve that in the opening of this Point, <hi>Of Sanctifying of the Name of God in holy Duties,</hi> that I have been in the boſoms of as many, as in the opening of any Point whatſoever; and as many may have cauſe to lay their hands upon their hearts, and ſay, Certainly I have come ſhort of what is required here, and have not been acquainted with this way, this myſtery of Godlineſs, <hi>Of Sanctifying of Gods Name in holy Duties</hi> as I ought to be: Oh be humbled for this, for all the uncleaneſs of your hearts in the performance of holy duties. <hi>Exod.</hi> 27. 4, 5. you reade, that at the Altar where the Sacrifices were to be offered, the Lord required that there ſhould be a grate made. <hi>Thou ſhalt make for it</hi> (meaning the Altar) <hi>a grate of net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of braſs, and upon the net ſhalt thou make four braſen rings in the four corners thereof, and thou ſhalt put it under the compaſs of</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:104284:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>the Altar beneath, that the net may be even to the middeſt of the Altar.</hi> There was (as it were) a grate for the aſhes of the Altar to go thorow: As you have grates in your fires to make them burn cleer, and for the aſhes to fall down; ſo the Lord would have ſuch a grate for the aſhes of the Altar to fall down: We had need of ſuch a grate. Oh the aſhes, dirt, and filth that there is in our ſervices when we come to offer and tender them up to God! ſo that we have cauſe (I ſay) to be humbled for holy offerings. There be many godly people that through Gods mercy, are able to keep from groſs ſins, they do not find it any great matter to keep from company, ſwearing, drinking, uncleanneſs, lying, or wronging of others, and ſuch kind of ſins as thoſe are, ſo that they ſee not ſuch need of humiliation in this regard, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be for that their natures be as corrupt as any though they break not forth into thoſe actual groſs ſins, but the main work of the humiliation of thoſe that are godly, it is, to be humbled for their thoughts, for the miſpending of time, and for not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of Gods Name in holy duties; thoſe are the main things that are the ſubject of the humiliation of the Saints, beſide the body of ſin and death that they carry about with them. And it would be a good ſign that thy heart hath ſome tenderneſs in it when thou makeſt theſe to be the matter of thy humiliation: Carnal people are little troubled for theſe, if they fall into ſuch ſins as that their conſciences do fly in their faces, then they are troubled and humbled; but for ſuch things as theſe are, they are ſeldom humbled: To be humbled for thy holy offerings is a good ſign of a gracious heart. We reade of <hi>Cherubims</hi> that they had ſix wings, and with two of their wings (the text ſaith) they covered their faces: So my Brethren, we had need have wings (as it were) to cover our beſt duties: they had wings, and with two they covered their legs, and with two their faces; we had need, not only of a covering for our lower parts &amp; meaner duties but a covering for our holy duties, to cover our faces, our beſt duties of all, the moſt heavenly duties we perform had need be purged by the blood of Chriſt: in <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 16. we reade of their holy things, that there was need of purging them by blood; and ſo it ſhould be in our holy duties. Let us be humbled for our
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104284:62"/>
beſt performance that ever we performed in our lives: The beſt had need be ſo. But then as for others that have made little or no conſcience of ſanctifying of Gods Name, how had they need be humbled? Thou haſt ſomething more to repent of than thou thoughteſt of; for the truth is, Thoſe that have not made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſanctifying of Gods Name in holy Duties, they never in all their lives did any ſervice for the honor of God; thou haſt lived perhaps thirty or fourty, it may be ſixty years or more, and didſt never yet honor God in any one thing that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou didſt in all thy life.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, <hi>God forbid: Have not I prayed, and heard the Word much, and received the Communion often, and yet have I never honored God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou haſt not been acquainted with this Myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſanctifying his Name in theſe things, this is ſaid from God to thee this morning, That thou haſt never done any one action to the honor of God: Thou hadſt need begin preſently for thy time is not long, And wilt thou go out of this world, and the Name of God never to be honored by thee:</p>
            <p>Yea, and further, Thou haſt loſt all thy duties, all the time hath been loſt that thou haſt been in performance of duties: now it is an ill thing to idle away time in the things of the world; When a man hath an opportunity for to gain in the world, if ſo be he loſes his time and neglects it, we account it a very ſad thing to him; but now to loſe our trading-time for Heaven (for the times of the worſhiping of God are our trading times for Heaven) that's ſad indeed: And yet thou that makeſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſanctifying the Name of God in holy duties, all the time thou haſt ſpent is loſt.</p>
            <p>And yet further, You that have been falſe in the performing of duties, and hypocrites, not only all your pains and labor is quite loſt (for if that were ſo it might be well with you) but you have aggravated your ſins by your holy Duties. Thoſe Duties that others have enjoyed Communion with God in, and furthered their eternal life by, thou haſt aggravated thy ſins by them, yet it was thy duty to do them; but I ſay, by not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of Gods Name, thou haſt aggravated thy ſins ſo much the more. As thoſe that are godly, they work out their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104284:62"/>
even in their natural actions they ſanctifie Gods Name, in eating and drinking, and following their buſineſs: they perform thoſe actions in ſuch a holy manner, as they honor God in them, and further their eternal peace; but as they in their Natural and Civil actions work out their ſalvation; ſo thou in the very religiouſeſt actions doſt work out thy damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Certainly wicked men that are not acquainted with this work of Godlineſs, to Sanctifie Gods Name in holy duties, they work out their damnation even in the performance of them.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, Then they had better not do them.</p>
            <p>Yes, they are bound to do them; but they are bound to do them in a right manner; as ſometimes I have given you this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and it is a ful and a cleer one, to ſhew that men are bound to perform holy duties, and not to leave them undone, and yet they may further their own damnation while they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: As for example, If ſo be that a Prince ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a man to come into his preſence ſuch a day to Petition for his life, which he hath forfeited by the Law, If he do not come he may be a dead man: But now, if this man be drunk on that day, and come drunk into the Kings preſence, he may be a dead man too, for preſuming to come drunk before him: So wicked and ungodly men, whether they worſhip or worſhip not, they are in danger to periſh. But of this more when we come to ſhew that <hi>God will be ſanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fourth place, here is an uſe of Exhortation, That ſeeing we have this truth thus preſented to us, and opened before us; Oh that we had hearts to apply our ſelves now to it with all our might, to ſeek to ſanctifie the Name of God when we draw nigh to him! The Lord hath ſhewen thee what it is that he requires of thee; make conſcience of it for time to come, thou doeſt not know what bleſſed communion thou mayeſt have with God if thou doeſt make conſcience of this, the truth is, If you have not been acquainted with this, you have not been acquainted with the way of a Chriſtian in his enjoyment of Communion with God, thou doeſt not know what the comfort of a Chriſtian life means; do but make tryal of this for time to come, and thou wilt find more comfort in the waies of Godlineſs, and more
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104284:63"/>
thriving in them in one quarter of a yeer than thou haſt done before in ſeven yeers, one Chriſtian that keeps cloſe to God in holy duties, and ſanctifies the Name of God in them, (I ſay) finds more comfort with God, and grows on in godlineſs more in one quarter of a yeer, than the other doth in ſeven yeers that goes on in an ordinary, dull, and formal way in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the duties of Worſhip: Some there are in our time that cry out of duties, And what need we trouble our ſelves ſo much? thoſe that know not how to ſanctifie Gods Name they think lightly of them; but now do you apply your ſelves ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as you are able) to this that I am ſpeaking of, and you will find your ſelves to be (as it were) in another world, you will be able to ſay, Well, I have not yet underſtood what it was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Communion with God in Prayer, in Word, and in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before; this will make your faces ſhine in your converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions if you would do it; and now to that end that you may do it, there are theſe two or three things that I would propound to you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, Learn to know God more, with whom you have to do, and preſent thoſe things that you have heard before you in your meditations, when as you are to come to God in Prayer, or in any other Duty, and when you are Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping of God, remember that you have to do with God and none elſe. You are every time you come to perform holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be as a man or woman ſeparated from all things. <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Maximus</hi> tels a ſtory of a yong Noble-man that attended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Alexander</hi> while he was ſacrificing, this Noble-man held his Cenſer for Incenſe, and in the holding of it, there fell a coal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fleſh and burnt it ſo, as the very ſcent of it was in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of all that were about him, and becauſe he would not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb <hi>Alexander</hi> in his ſervice, he reſolutely did not ſtir to put of the fire from him, but holds ſtill his Cenſer. If Heathens made ſuch ado in their ſacrificing to their Idol-gods, that they would mind it ſo, as no diſturbance muſt be made what ever they endured: What care ſhould we have then of our ſelves when we come to worſhip the high God? And ſo <hi>Joſephus</hi> he reports of the Prieſts that were ſacrificing in the Temple when <hi>Pompey</hi> brake in to them with armed men, and though they
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104284:63"/>
might have fled and ſaved their lives, yet they would not leave off their ſacrificing, but were ſlain by the Soldiers: They did ſo mind it as a matter of great conſequence. Oh that we could mind the duties of Gods Worſhip as matters of great moment, that ſo we might learn to ſanctifie the Name of God in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them more than ever we have done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When thou comeſt to worſhip, take heed thou doeſt not come in thine own ſtrength. For there is more required in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the Name of God than thy ſtrength is able to carry thee on in, and therefore act thy Faith upon Jeſus Chriſt every time thou comeſt to worſhip God, not only as I ſaid before, to tender up thy ſervices in his Name, but act thy faith upon Chriſt to give thee ſtrength to do what thou haſt to do. And what ſtrength thou haſt received from Chriſt be ſure to ſtir it up: many godly men and women have more ſtrength than they know of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and if they would but ſtir up that ſtrength that they have received, they might ſanctifie the Name of God a great deal more than they do. Therfore remember that text before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>None ſtirs up himſelf to take hold on God:</hi> Quicken up thy heart, and rouze up thy ſpirit when thou art to worſhip God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When ever thou art worſhiping of God, do not ſatisfie thy ſelf meerly in the duty done, but conſider, Do I ſanctifie Gods Name in the duty? Every time thou worſhipeſt him, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy heart, whether thou doeſt it, yea, or no. And if thou findeſt that thou haſt not attained in ſome comfortable meaſure to this that hath been preſented to thee, let the ſhame and the ſorrow for that abide upon thy ſpirit until the next time thou comeſt to worſhip God; at ſuch a time I have been worſhiping of God, and God knows I have been ſtirring up my heart in ſome meaſure; but I find my heart dead, wandring, ſluggiſh, and dull; I ſay, when thou findeſt thou canſt not do it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is required in any comfortable meaſure, let the ſhame and ſorrow of heart for it abide upon thee till the next time thou comeſt to worſhip God, and that will mightily help thee: Thou art now praying, and thou canſt not now get up thy heart to what is required; The next time thou comeſt to prayer, come in the ſhame and ſorrow of thy heart for the want of ſanctifying Gods Name the laſt time: And ſo for hearing of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104284:64"/>
the Word, or receiving the Sacraments. And this will further thee mightily for the ſanctifying the Name of God in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>But now that all may be ſealed up unto you, and ſo that we may cloſe the Point, know, <hi>That God will be ſanctified in thoſe that do draw nigh to Him.</hi> And there are theſe two things in the Point.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If we do not ſanctifie Gods Name, God will ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his Name in a way of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we do ſanctifie his Name, then he will ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his Name in a way of mercy towards us.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, God will manifeſt that he is diſpleaſed with ſuch duties that thou doeſt perform, he will manifeſt it one way or other that he is a holy God, and he doth not accept of ſuch unholy things as thou doeſt tender up to him; for the truth is, if God ſhould accept of ſuch unholy things from men, God may be ſaid to be like unto themſelves. As a man if he doth entertain any as his familiar friend that is naught and wicked, it is his diſgrace and diſhonor; a man may ſometimes imploy in ſome buſineſs thoſe that are naught and wicked, and it may be no diſgrace to him, but if he doth entertain one in his houſe that is wicked, it is a diſhonor to him: So God may imploy the moſt wicked men in the world in ſome outward ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, but if he ſhould accept of them in his Worſhip, it would be a diſhonor to God, and therefore God that he might ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his own Name, he will manifeſt his diſpleaſure at one time or other againſt ſuch duties of worſhip; you that perform wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in a formal manner, and with unclean vile hearts; I ſay, it ſtands upon the Honor of God, if he will manifeſt Himſelf a holy God, He muſt manifeſt ſome diſpleaſure againſt that way of thy worſhiping of him: This one meditation one would think, ſhould mightily ſink into the heart of any man that hath an enlightned conſcience, to think thus, It ſtands upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of God, And he cannot appear to be a holy God except he doth ſome way or other appear to be againſt me in ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that I tender up unto him.</p>
            <p>Now you will ſay, How doth God appear, that he doth not accept of them? He will appear in theſe three things:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:104284:64"/>
1. Firſt, By blaſting thoſe that do worſhip him thus in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal way: It ſhall at firſt be ſecret, but afterwards it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more apparantly, and we ſee it by experience, that ſuch as have been Profeſſors of Religion, and worſhip God in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, and in formality, they have been blaſted in their parts and common gifts.</p>
            <p>The Judgment of God upon <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> that did not Sanctifie Gods Name, it was ſecret at firſt; It ſtruck them dead, and though by fire, yet if you reade the ſtory, you ſhall find that their cloathes were not burnt, and yet they were burnt in their bodies: So the Lord ſometimes doth blaſt men inwardly in their Spirits, in their Souls, in their Parts, in their common Gifts; He blaſts them (I ſay) inwardly though it doth not appear outwardly, yet at length it will appear before men that they are blaſted; and in theſe times of the Goſpel the Lord doth come with ſpiritual judgments rather than with outward tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral judgments. In the time of the Law, thoſe that did not Sanctifie the Name of God in holy duties, the Lord did appear by ſome external and viſible way upon their bodies; but now in the time of the Goſpel, there God comes with more ſpiritual judgments upon mens ſouls, and thoſe are the moſt terrible judgments: We have a notable Scripture for this in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 13. How God doth blaſt thoſe that do not ſanctifie his Name in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties. <hi>Wherefore the Lord ſaid, Foraſmuch as this people draw neer me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the Precepts of men:</hi> Mark what follows: <hi>Therfore behold I wil proceed to do a marvelous work amongſt this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the wiſdom of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of their prudent men ſhall be hid.</hi> What do they come and draw neer me with their lips, and their hearts are far from me, and do they worſhip me in a formal way? I'le take away the wiſdom from the wiſe, and the underſtanding from the prudent: And that is the reaſon why ſo many great Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are blaſted in their very Parts, becauſe they would worſhip God according to the precepts of men, in a formal way; and ſo all Hypocrites, and formal Worſhipers, the Lord doth blaſt them in one way or other; the judgments of God upon the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104284:65"/>
of men were ſometimes in the time of the Law; But in the times of the Goſpel there we find generally the judgments of God to be more ſpiritual upon the hearts and conſciences of men; we find it by experience God doth diſcover that he doth not accept of ſuch as thoſe are; and therefore when you ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that have made profeſſion of Religion, that had excellent Parts at firſt, many common gifts, and now are as we ſay, no body; Remember this Text, <hi>That God will be ſanctified in thoſe that come nigh Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord doth manifeſt that he will be ſanctified in thoſe that draw nigh him, by awaking their conſciences many times upon their ſick beds and death beds, the Lord doth force them to give glory to Him, and there to acknowledg that they did not worſhip God in Uprightneſs but in Formality. And now they are in horror of conſcience and cry out in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of their ſouls upon the apprehenſion of the dreadful wrath of God that is upon them: Take heed for the Lords ſake of this thing, when you are performing of the duties of Worſhip, do not reſt in the outward duties for they will never comfort you upon your ſick and death beds, you may perhaps put off your conſciences a little for the preſent, but when you come upon your ſick beds there will be no comfort unto you, and then you will be forced to ſay, wel, all this while I have but taken the Name of God in vain, and now God hath rejected me and all my ſervices; and you will then ſpeak to thoſe that come about your beds ſide, and bid them take warning by you: take heed that when you worſhip God you worſhip him to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I have ſpent time in prayer, and hearing; but for want of this I find I have no comfort at all, but the Lord appears to be terrible to my ſoul and comes out againſt me as an enemy. I ſay now Gods Name is ſanctified: whatever becomes of thee, he will force glory from thee one way or other, and it may be even here in this time of thy life; but however, at the great day, when the ſecrets of all hearts muſt be diſcloſed before Men and Angles, then the Lord will appear to be a holy God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all ſuch ſervices that thou dideſt tender up to him, and it will then be a great part of the work of the day of Judgment for God to be ſanctified in thoſe that did worſhip him; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104284:65"/>
before Men and Angels, how did he reject ſuch formal and hypocritical worſhip that they did tender up unto him, Oh that God would ſtrike this upon your hearts that it may abide upon you every time you come to worſhip him, to think thus, Let me look to it to ſanctifie his Name now, for I hear that God will ſanctifie it himſelf if I do not do it.</p>
            <p>But then on the other ſide, If ſo be that thou makeſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſanctifying Gods Name in duties, then he will ſanctifie his Name in a way of Mercy; that is, he will manifeſt how he doth accept of the leaſt degree of holineſs though there be much mixture: God hath a way to take away the mixture by the blood of his Son, and then to accept of any holineſs he ſees in thee, He will ſanctifie his Name by meeting with thee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing his glory to thee when thou art worſhiping of him: There is an excellent Scripture for this, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 43. <hi>There I will meet with the Children of Iſrael, and the Tabernacle ſhall be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by my Glory.</hi> Thou that haſt a gracious heart, and art worſhiping of God in ſincerity, thou art as a Tabernacle of God, and God hath his Service and Worſhip from thee, thou art as the Temple of God, <hi>and there will I meet with thee</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and I will ſanctifie my Tabernacle by my Glory.</hi> God wil ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie thy heart by his Glory, if thou doſt ſanctifie his Name.</p>
            <p>Further, Thou ſhalt (it may be) not alwaies have ſuch glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious comforts, the full beams of the Sun riſing upon thee, but at one time or other the Lord will break in upon thee and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his Glory to thee, and it's like if thou haſt not ſuch full comforts now, yet upon thy ſick bed, though God doth not then alwaies manifeſt himſelf fully, for ſometimes the diſeaſe may be a hinderance, yet it is ordinary that thoſe that in their conſtant way did ſanctifie Gods Name in holy duties, they do lie comfortably upon their ſick beds, and a glorious entrance is made for them into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And then again, All things are ſanctified unto them: as on the other ſide, thoſe that do not ſanctifie Gods Name, all things are curſed to them, if thou doeſt not make conſcience of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Gods Name in duties, God cares not to ſanctifie any thing for thy good: But now, thoſe that make conſcience of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104284:66"/>
Sanctifying Gods Name in holy duties, the Lord takes care, that all things ſhall be ſanctified for their good, for the ſurthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their eternal good.</p>
            <p>And however it be here, yet hereafter at the great day of Judgment it will be a part of the glory of God to manifeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men and Angels how he did accept of thoſe holy ſervices that thou didſt tender up to him; when Hypocrites ſhall be caſt away and abhor'd, and thou who hadſt an upright ſincere heart ſhalt be owned before God, and before men and Angels at that great Day: and God ſhall ſay, Well, it is a part of the glory of my Holineſs to make it appear that I have accepted of theſe holy things, that theſe my poor ſervants have tendered up to me. And this now is of marvelous uſe for the comforting of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart: thoſe duties that thou doeſt now think thou haſt loſt, and there will nothing come of them, thou ſhalt certainly hear of them another day, God will make it appear, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he ſtands more upon than the glory of his Holineſs; and it is the glory of his Holineſs that is thy ſtrength in this thing, and that makes it certain to thee that there muſt be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of thy acceptance: and therefore take theſe Truths into thy heart about ſanctifying the Name of God. You have had only the Point in general opened to you: Oh that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God would bring things unto your remembrance.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have (as you may remember) Preached many Sermons upon that Point, <hi>Of Sanctifying the Name of God in the Duties of his Worſhip:</hi> We have ſpoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Point in the General, the laſt day we finiſhed it. I do not intend to look back to any thing that was ſaid, but we are to proceed to ſhew how the Name of God ſhould be San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified in the Particular Duties of his Worſhip. Now the Duties of Gods Worſhip, are eſpecially theſe Three:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The Hearing of the Word.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Receiving of the Sacrament.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>And Prayer.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Other things come under <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but yet theſe are the three chief duties of Worſhip; and I intend to ſpeak to al theſe three, and to ſhew how we ſhould Sanctifie the Name of God in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh unto him, in the Word, Sacrament, and Prayer.</p>
            <p>We might chuſe ſeveral Texts for all theſe, but they fall full within the General, and therefore it ſhall be ſufficient, for to ground the Sanctifying of Gods Name in theſe Duties of Worſhip upon this Text.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Of Sanctifying the Name of God in the Hearing of the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat which we are to ſpeak to this morning, it is the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Name of God in the hearing of his Word; If you would have the ground of what we are to ſay concerning this in a particular Scripture, you may have it in <hi>Luke,</hi> 8. 18.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104284:67"/>
               <hi>take heed therefore how ye hear:</hi> It is not enough to come to hear the Word, that is good, and no queſtion but God is pleaſed with the willingneſs of people to come to hear his Word, but you muſt not reſt barely in hearing, but <hi>take heed how you hear.</hi> Now this is a Point of great conſequence, and I hope it may do good, to help to make many Sermons to be profitable to you, and the Point (I hope) is ſeaſonable, and will be very ſutable unto you: For thoſe that come to hear ſo ſoon in a morning, and are willing, even in hard weather, to come out of their beds, they give ſome good teſtimony that they do deſire to honor God in their hearing, and to get good by their hearing; and 'tis pity that labor and pains ſhould be beſtowed, and no profit, but hurt rather got by it, which God forbid. Therefore now I am to ſpeak to a Point that may help you ſo to hear, as may recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence all your labor and pains in hearing. In preaching to thoſe that come to hear, ſo that they may get good and benefit by it, there is a great deal more encouragement than to ſuch as come in a formal way becauſe they uſe to come; therfore this Point being a great Point, I ſhall open it ſomewhat largely, and caſt into this Method:</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you, <hi>That the hearing of Gods</hi> Word <hi>is a part of the Worſhip of God;</hi> for otherwiſe I could not ground it upon my text.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall ſhew you, <hi>How we are to ſanctifie Gods Name in the hearing of his Word, either in regard of preparation unto it, or our behavior in hearing of the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Why it is that God will be ſanctified in this Ordinance of his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>How God will ſanctifie himſelf in ſuch as do not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie his Name in the hearing of his</hi> Word.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>How God will ſanctifie his Name in waies of mercy to thoſe that are careful to ſanctifie his Name in the hearing of the</hi> Word.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Five Principal things that concern this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>That the hearing of Gods</hi> Word, <hi>it is a part of Gods Worſhip.</hi> You heard in the opening of the Worſhip of God in the general, what it was; I told you it was, <hi>a tendring</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:104284:67"/>
               <hi>up of the creatures homage to God,</hi> as teſtimony of the reſpect that the creature did owe to God; Now if that be the nature of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, certainly the hearing of Gods Word it is a part of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: for, in the hearing of Gods Word we,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Do profeſs our dependance upon God for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Mind and the way to Eternal Life: Every time we come to hear the Word, if we know what we do, we do thus much, We do profeſs, that we do depend upon the Lord God for the knowing of his Mind, and the Way and Rule to Eternal Life; we do as much as if we ſhould ſay, Lord, of our ſelves we neither know thee, nor the way and means how we ſhould come to be ſaved, and therfore that we might teſtifie our dependance upon thee for this thing, we here preſent our ſelves before thee. Now this is a Teſtimony of the high reſpect we owe to God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The hearing of Gods Word is a part of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> becauſe in it we come to wait upon God in the way of an Ordinance, to have that good conveyed to us by way of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance beyond what the thing in it ſelf is able to do, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis Worſhip; I wait upon God when I am hearing the Word (if I know what I do) to have ſom ſpiritual good convei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me beyond what there is in the means it ſelf, this makes it Worſhip. When I am buſied in Natural and Civil actions, there I muſt profeſs, that theſe things can do me no good without God, but I do not wait upon God in an Ordinance for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of Natural good beyond what God hath put into the Creature, 'tis his bleſſing with it, that God in the ordinary courſe of his providence doth convey ſuch Natural or Civil good in the uſe of thoſe Creatures: But now, when I come to hear his Word, I here come to wait upon God in the way of an Ordinance for the conveyance of ſome ſpiritual good that this Ordinance hath not in it ſelf (take it materially) but meerly as it hath an Inſtitution in it, and is appointed by God for the conveyance of ſuch and ſuch things. God doth appoint meat to nouriſh me, and together with his appointment he hath given a natural power to meat to nouriſh my body, that in an ordinary courſe of providence is enough for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my body; but now when I come to hear the Word, I
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104284:68"/>
muſt look upon that not only as a thing appointed to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſoul, and to ſave my ſoul by, not as a thing that hath any efficacy put into it in a natural way as the other hath; it is not the nature of the thing that carries ſuch a power in it, but it is the Inſtitution of God, and the Ordinance of God in it; Now then, when I come to wait upon God in an Ordinance for the ſpiritual good that is beyond the vertue of any creature to convey to me, certainly I worſhip God, that is a ſpeciall part of worſhip to wait upon God in this way; Therefore in theſe two reſpects, the hearing of Gods Word it is a part of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and I beſeech you remember theſe two things eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time you come to hear. I come now to give a Teſtimony that I am not able to underſtand God and the way to eternal life of my ſelf, but I do depend upon God for the knowledg of it. And here I come to wait upon God for the conveyance of that good to my ſoul that is not in the power of any creature to convey: Now I worſhip when I do theſe.</p>
            <p>But further (you ſhall find it more plain when we come to open how we ſhould ſanctifie Gods Name in the hearing of His Word) This is Divine Service, as much as any ſervice can be performed. Heretofore our Prelates and thoſe kind of men, made all the Worſhip of God to be in their Divine Service (as they call'd it) which was of their own inventions, and made light of the preaching or hearing of the Word, but the Word is a great part of that Divine Service that God requires of us in His Worſhip, and in it you do tender up your homage to God; You therefore muſt not only when you come to hear, think, I come to get ſomething, I come to underſtand more than I did, and to hear ſuch a mans parts, and the like, but remember you come to tender up your homage to God, to ſit at Gods feet and there to profeſs your ſubjection to Him: That is one end of your coming to hear Sermons.</p>
            <p>Now then you will ſay, What ſhould be done in the hearing Gods Word, ſo as Gods Name may be Sanctified?</p>
            <p>For that, as we opened in the general, That in the duties of Gods Worſhip, there muſt be preparation, and then an anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable behavior of the ſoul. So here, there muſt firſt be a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul to this work, and then an anſwerable behavior of the ſoul in it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:104284:68"/>
1. There muſt be a preparation of the Soul, ſo as when you come to hear, you may with all readineſs receive the Word: The ſoul muſt be made ready, in <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. there it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe were more noble than thoſe of</hi> Theſſalonica, <hi>in that they received the Word with all readineſs of mind:</hi> The word is, with all <hi>Alacrity</hi> as well as readineſs; their minds were in a fit preparation to receive the Word: and the text ſaith, <hi>They were more noble:</hi> The word that is tranſlated <hi>more noble,</hi> it ſignifies <hi>better bred;</hi> for I do not take this Scripture as if it were meant only of men that were Earls, or Lords, that did thus receive the Word with readineſs, but they were of a more Noble diſpoſition, they were <hi>well bred men,</hi> ſo the Greek word ſignifies. A man ſometimes preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a company of rude people, that never had any good bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, they will behave themſelves rudely, they ſlight the Word, and like the Swine regard Acorns rather than Pearls: And the Word is ſeldom ſo profitable to a company of rude people that have no breeding at all; but now, there is more hopes to preach to men that have breeding; Men that are exerciſed in Arts and Sciences, and have ſome underſtanding, and ſome ingenuity in them, they will hearken to reaſon. Now there is a great deal of ſpiritual reaſon in the Word, there is a great deal to convince men that are but rational men; Let a man be but a rational man, and willing to attend to the Word, I ſay, there is a great deal of reaſon to convince him in it, and it is a ſign of good breeding, of men of ingenuity, to be willing to hear the Word; Who are thoſe in a Pariſh that ſo diſregard the Word as not to hear it, but the ruder ſort? There are many, I confeſs, that are men of parts, perhaps the Word doth not ſo prevail with their hearts as to convert them, yet if they have any good breeding at all, if the Word be preached in a convincing way, ſo that they ſee there is a pains taken, and preached as the Word of God to them, they will vouchſafe their preſence at leaſt; but the rude multitude that know nothing at all, they had rather be in Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes drinking and ſwilling, they never care to hear the Word; As in ſuch a place as this, There are very few of your miſerable poor people that come to hear the Word: What place is there fuller of miſerable poor people than this place is? and yet what a poor appearance is there of ſuch people at the hearing of the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:104284:69"/>
Word? But now thoſe that have any ingenuity in them at all, or any breeding (for ſo the word is) they will <hi>receive the Word with readineſs:</hi> But this breeding here ſpoken of, was a little higher than natural breeding; They were ſpiritually Noble, and ſo they had a readineſs in their hearts in receiving the Word. Now this readineſs of heart in receiving the Word conſiſts in theſe particulars:</p>
            <p>Firſt, When you come to hear the Word, if you would ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie Gods Name, you muſt poſſeſs your ſouls with what it is that you are going to hear, That what you are to hear is the Word of God, That it is not the ſpeaking of a man that you are going to attend upon, but that you are now going to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon God, and to hear the Word of the Eternal God. Poſſeſs your ſouls with this, you will never ſanctifie Gods Name elſe, in the hearing of his Word; therefore you find that the Apoſtle writing to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> he gives them the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Word did them ſo much good as it did: It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did hear it as the Word of God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>For this cauſe alſo (ſaith he) thank we God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the Word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that beleeve.</hi> Mark, ſo it came effectually to work, becauſe they received it as the Word of God; many times you will ſay, Come, let us go hear ſuch a man preach; Oh no, let us go hear Chriſt preach, for as it doth concern the Miniſters of God that they preach not themſelves, but that Chriſt ſhould preach in them: So it concerns you that hear, not to come to hear this man, or that man, but to come to hear Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>We as the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt do beſeech you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Poſſeſs your hearts likewiſe with this Conſideration, That I come to hear the Word as an Ordinance appointed by God to convey Spiritual good to my ſoul, and this is a very uſeful conſideration, and eſpecially it concerns men of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and parts for the helping of them to hear. For men that are of underſtanding and parts, when they come to hear, this temptation is ready to come upon them, that except they hear ſome new thing that they did not underſtand before, wherefore
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104284:69"/>
ſhould they come? I am able to underſtand as much in ſuch a point as can be ſaid: And when I have come and heard many times, I have heard but that I knew before, and upon that they think there is no uſe of coming to hear: Now this is a great miſtake; when you come to hear the Word, you do not come alwaies to hear what you did not know, it may be ſometimes God may dart in ſomething that you did not think of before, or ſo fully underſtand; but ſuppoſe it be not ſo, you are to come to it as an Ordinance of God, for the conveyance of ſpiritual good to your ſouls.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, <hi>Cannot we ſit at home and reade a Sermon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But hath God appointed that the great Ordinance for the converting and the edifying of ſouls in the way to eternal life? True, there is ſome uſe of it; but the great Ordinance is the Preaching of the Word, <hi>Faith comes by hearing</hi> (the Scripture ſaith) and never by reading; So that though when you come to hear, you do not hear that which you heard not before, yet you come to attend upon this Ordinance for the conveyance of ſome ſpiritual good that (it may be) hath not been conveyed before, or in a further degree than it hath been conveyed before: and ſo you ſhould come to hear the Word with your hearts poſſeſt with that meditation, That it is the Word of God, and the great Ordinance that God hath appointed for the conveyance of ſpiritual good; ſo that I come now in obedience to God, and in this I do teſtifie my reſpect to God, that I wil attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Ordinance of His for the conveyance of ſpiritual good to me, and although I may think that this or the other means may do the deed as well, yet becauſe God hath appointed this to be his Ordinance, therefore in obedience to him I will attend upon this means rather than upon other means: as you know <hi>Naaman</hi> he thought the other waters would have been as good as the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> to have healed him, but if God will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him the waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> that they ſhould heal him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than other waters, he muſt waſh there: No queſtion but other waters had as much natural vertue in them as they had, but becauſe the waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> were the Ordinance that God for that time had appointed to cure his Leproſie withal, he muſt come and waſh in thoſe waters rather than in any other:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104284:70"/>
So, becauſe preaching of the Word is the great Ordinance that God hath appointed to convey himſelf by, therefore he doth require that thou ſhouldeſt ſhew thy reſpect to him, ſo far as to attend upon him in this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>The Second thing that is to be done in way of preparation, it is, <hi>To plow up the fallow ground of your hearts, and not to ſow amongſt thorns;</hi> as you have it in <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 3. and ſo in <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 10. The Word of God (you know) is compared to ſeed, in that Parable of Chriſt, in <hi>Mat,</hi> 13. And an Auditory is compared to the ground: I ſuppoſe you are al acquainted with that Parable of the ſower, that it is to ſet out the Miniſtry of the Word, and what fruit it hath upon the hearts of men; a Congregation is like the field, and a Miniſter preaching is like the Sower that ſows the ſeed in the field; he knows not which Truth, whether that or the other will proſper; the ſeed being ſowed, in ſome part of the ground is loſt, and in another part it grows: ſo in one Pew the ſeed of the Word is loſt, in another Pew it grows up. But now, if people that are compared to the ground, would ſo hear the Word, as Gods Name may de ſanctified in it, their hearts muſt be plowed; as if one ſhould ſow ſeed upon green ſoil, ſaw it in the fields upon green graſs, What would become of it? The ground muſt firſt be plowed for the preparation of the ſeed.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, <hi>What is the meaning of the plowing of our hearts for the preparation of the</hi> Word?</p>
            <p>The meaning is nothing elſe but this, The work of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the humbling of the ſoul before the Lord when it doth come to hear Gods Word.</p>
            <p>Humble it in theſe two regards.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Be humbled for your Ignorance, that you know ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Gods Mind as you do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Be humbled for all the ſinfulneſs of your hearts, be ſenſible of the ſinfulneſs and wretchedneſs of your hearts, and the miſerable condition that you are in; if you can get your hearts broken with the ſence of your ſin and miſery, and come ſo to hear the Word, it is very like the Word may be of mighty uſe, and Gods Name may be very much ſanctified in your hearing of the Word.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:104284:70"/>
You will ſay, Muſt we plow up our hearts before we come to hear? It muſt be the Word that muſt plow us, the Word is the Plow, and ſo the Miniſters of God are compared to Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Word, <hi>He that puts his hand to the Plow and looks back is not fit for the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, it cannot be expected that the heart ſhould be throughly plowed as it ought but by the Word, therefore at the firſt coming to hear there is not hope that men will ſanctifie Gods Name till the Word gets into plow them, and ſo by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at one time into their hearts they come to be prepared for hearing at another time. And yet ſomewhat may be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by that natural knowledg that men have they may come to know themſelves to be ſinners, and come to underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be very weak and ignorant by ſome knowledg that they may have by the works of God, and by conference with others, and by reading and the like, and ſo they may in ſome meaſure come to have their hearts to be humble. And it is good to make uſe of theſe to humble the heart: but now, You that have heard the Word often, and yet have not ſanctified Gods Name, there be Truths that you have heard heretofore, that if you had made uſe of in private to have plowed up your hearts, they would have prepared your hearts for the next time in hearing of the Word, If therefore you would hear the word with a great deal more profit than formerly, your hearts muſt be plowed by humiliation,</p>
            <p>Secondly, The heart muſt be plowed, by laboring to get out thoſe throns that are in the heart, thoſe luſts that grow deep in the heart as throns grow in the ground: labor to pluck them out, that is, when thou comeſt to hear the word get thy heart into that frame, as to be willing to profeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every known ſin that thou haſt found in thy heart, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to find out thoſe luſts that are in thy heart, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs againſt them, that thou art willing to have them to be rooted out of thy heart: if men and women would but do thus when they come to hear, that God might ſee this in them, that they have before they come profeſt againſt every known ſin, This would be an excellent thing indeed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again in the third place, which will follow from hence,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104284:71"/>
When thou comeſt to hear the Word, come with reſolution to yeeld to what ever God ſhall reveal to be his Mind, I am now going to hear thy Word O Lord, to wait upon thee, to know what thou haſt to ſay to me; and thou that art the ſearcher of the ſecrets of all hearts, Thou knoweſt that I go with ſuch a reſolution to yeeld up my ſelf to every truth of thine, How would the Name of God be ſanctified if you did thus come to hear the Word! If you did come with ſuch a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>Job</hi> 32. 34. <hi>That which I know not, teach thou me; and if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 3. you have a Prophſie of the Gentils, how they ſhould come to the Word, <hi>And many people ſhall go and ſay, Come ye, and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, to the Houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us of his waies, and we will walk in his paths:</hi> Here's a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed diſpoſition when you come to hear the Word. Some of you come together in ſtreets and lanes, and over the fields; when you come together, and meet one with another as you walk over the fields, make uſe of this text, Oh! that this Propheſie might be fulfilled in your coming over the fields every Lord's day, morning, and at other times, that you would ſay one to another, or when you call one upon another to go to hear, <hi>Come, let us go up to the houſe of the Lord, and he will teach us of his waies and we will walk in his paths.</hi> We are reſolved, that what ever the Lord ſhall teach us to be his waies, we will ſubmit unto it. This is a due preparation of the heart for the ſanctifying of Gods Name in the hearing of his Word.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When you come to hear the Word, <hi>come with lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging deſires after the Word,</hi> come with an appitite to it: As in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>As new-born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby.</hi> Do it as new-born babes. Now you know lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle babes they do not deſire milk to play withal, but only to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them: Children of three or four yeers old, they may deſire milk to play with; but new-born babes never care for it but when they are hungry, to nouriſh them. And ſo it is true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come to hear the Word to play with it. But now you ſhould come to hear the Word as new-born babes, with a hungring deſire after the Word, that your ſouls may be nouriſhed therby. That were excellent, if every Lords day, and at other daies you

did come as hungry to the Word, as ever you went to your din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or ſupper, the Word of God ſhould be unto you <hi>more than your appointed food,</hi> and then you are like to grow by it, and to ſanctifie Gods Name in it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Pray beforehand, That God would open thine eyes, and open thine heart, and accompany his Word.</hi> Thus did <hi>David, Open mine eyes, O Lord, that I may underſtand the wonders of thy Law.</hi> And you know what is ſaid of <hi>Lydia, The Lord opened her heart, to attend to the Word that was ſpoken:</hi> Now ſeeing it is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thou doeſt exſpect more good from, than what it ſelf of its own nature is able to convey, thou hadeſt need to pray, Lord, I go to ſuch an Ordinance of thine, and I know there is no efficacy in it ſelf, it is not able to reach to ſuch effects as I exſpect; that is, To have my heart ſpoken too, and quickned, and to have mine eyes opened; But O Lord, open mine eyes, and open mine heart; Lord, my heart naturally is lockt up againſt thy Word, there are ſuch wards in my heart, that except thou are pleaſed to put in a key that may fit my heart, it will never open; Man, he is not able to know my heart, and therefore he cannot fit a key to anſwer every word, to reſolve every doubt, to ſilence every objection; but Lord, thou canſt do it: Do thou Lord therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it thy Word this day that may meet with my heart; Lord, I have gone often to thy Word, and the key hath ſtuck in it, and it hath not opened; but Lord, if thou wouldſt but fit it, and turn it with thine own hand, my heart would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Oh! come with ſuch a praying heart to the Word, and thereby ſhalt thou ſanctifie the Name of God in hearing his Word: This is to come to the Word, as to the Word of God, You muſt not come to the hearing of the Word as to hear a Speech, or an Oration, but come in ſuch a preparation as this is: and ſo (I ſay) God will be glorified, and you ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited.</p>
            <p>The next thing is, <hi>What ſhould be the behavior of the ſoul in the ſanctifying Gods Name in the Word when it is come. Now to that there are theſe Particulars:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>There muſt be a careful attention unto the WORD,</hi> you muſt ſet your hearts unto it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 46. he ſaid unto the people, <hi>Set your hearts unto all the words which I teſtifie</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:104284:72"/>
               <hi>among you this day, which you ſhall command your children to obſerve to do; for it is not a vain thing for you, becauſe it is your life.</hi> Set your hearts to it, for it is not a vain thing, it is your life: when you come to hear the Word, give diligent attention to what you hear. In <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 6. it is ſaid <hi>The people with one accord gave heed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe things which</hi> Philip <hi>ſpake. They gave heed.</hi> The word is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed often in Scripture, ſometimes it is uſed for to beware of a thing, <hi>Beware of the leaven of the Phariſees,</hi> beware of them: As a man when he ſees an enemy, and is aware of him, he is very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to obſerve how to avoid him: So, there muſt be as much diligence to get good by the Word, as one would be diligent to avoid any danger whatſoever. And the word ſignifies ſomtimes to give ſuch heed as a Diſciple gives unto his Maſter, ſo they gave heed to the Word. So in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 1, 2. <hi>My ſon, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandements with thee, ſo that thou incline thine ear unto wiſdom.</hi> We muſt diligently attend, and not ſuffer our eyes and our thoughts to be wandring, but diligently attend to what is ſaid: My brethren, there is all things that may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge attention in the Word.</p>
            <p>What would make you to attend to any thing?</p>
            <p>Firſt, If he that ſpeaks were much above you, if it were a great Prince or Lord that ſpake to you, then you would attend. Now, though it is true, it is but a man, that, it may be, is inferior to moſt of you, that ſpeaks; yet know, in him it is the Lord of Heaven and Earth that ſpeaks to you. And ſo you know what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me:</hi> So, though you would not attend in reſpect of the Meſſenger ſo much, yet as it is the Son of God that is ſpeaking to you, it may challenge your attention. This day if you ſhould hear a voice out of the Clouds from Heaven ſpeaking to you, would you not then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten? The truth is, we ſhould liſten as much to the voice of God in the Miniſtry of his Word, as if ſo be that the Lord ſhould ſpeak out of the Clouds to us. And I will give you a Scripture for that, that the voyce of God in his Word ſhould be as much regarded of you, as if God ſhould ſpeak from Heaven to you by an audible voice out of the Clouds. In 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>This voice which came from Heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy Mount.</hi> But mark, in verſ. 19. <hi>We have alſo a more ſure Word of</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:104284:72"/>
               <hi>Propheſie, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed.</hi> Mark, We heard a voice from Heaven, ſaith <hi>Peter;</hi> yea, <hi>but we have a more ſure word of Propheſie, whereunto you do wel that ye take heed.</hi> There was a voice from Heaven ſpake. You will ſay, If we had heard that voice, we would have given heed to that. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>You have a more ſure Word of Propheſie.</hi> Now Propheſie in Scripture is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Preaching; <hi>Deſpiſe not Propheſie:</hi> As if the holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay, You muſt have regard to the word of Propheſie as you would have regard to any voice from Heaven; Suppoſe an Angel ſhould come and ſpeak to you, Would not you attend to him? then whatſoever thoughts you had, they would be taken off, for there is an Angel that is come down from Heaven to ſpeak: Now mark what is ſaid in <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake in times paſt to the fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt daies ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the worlds.</hi> And then in verſ. 3. he deſcribes his Son, <hi>And being made ſo much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they:</hi> If a Prophet ſhould come and ſpeak, that is not ſo much as if the Son of God comes, no, nor as if an Angel ſhould come, for Jeſus Chriſt hath obtained a more excellent Name than the Angels, &amp; it is Chriſt that is the Miniſtry of his Word, <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That which would cauſe attention, is the greatneſs of the matter propounded: It's true, if a man ſhould ſpeak of ſome ſlight and vain things, there need not ſo much attention. My brethern, the matters in the Word are the <hi>great Things</hi> of God, it is the Voice of God, the great Myſteries of Godlineſs, thoſe deep things that the Angels themſelves deſire to pry into; yea, the Angels themſelves by the Churches they come to have the knowledge of the Myſteries of God. I make no queſtion but in the Miniſtery of the Word among the Churches, the Angels they attend and come to ſome knowledge in the Myſteries of Godlineſs; for ſo the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That they have it by the Churches,</hi> there the greateſt things of Gods Will, the greateſt Counſels of God that were kept hid from all eternity, are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to you in the Miniſtry of the Word: We do not come to tel you tales, and the conceits of men, but to open the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104284:73"/>
of God, wherein the depth of the Wiſdom of God comes to be revealed to the children of men, and therefore this cals for attention.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe they be great things, yet if they do not ſo much concern us, there is no ſuch great reaſon of attention; Therefore in the Third place, that which we ſpeak, it is <hi>Your Life</hi> it is that concerns your Souls and Eternal eſtates: Your Souls and Everlaſting Eſtates do lie upon the Miniſtry of the Word; if that be made effectual to you, you are ſaved: if that be not made effectual to you, you are damned and undone for ever. If we ſhould come to tel you of ſomething whereby you might get ſome good bargain, or of a way how to get great riches, I make no queſtion but you would riſe though it were a cold or rainy morning: But know, when you are called to hear the Word, you are called to hear that which may do you good for ever, that for which you may bleſs God for to all eternity with the Angels and Saints in the higheſt Heavens; If they be ſuch things of ſo great concernment, then there had need be great attention: You know what Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Martha</hi> when ſhe was troubled about his entertainment, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 41. Martha, Martha, <hi>thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful; and</hi> Mary <hi>hath choſen that good part which ſhall not be taken away from her.</hi> What did <hi>Mary</hi> chooſe? It was this, That ſhe did diligently attend upon Jeſus Chriſt to hear the Word from his own mouth, when <hi>Martha</hi> was buſied in the houſe to provide for his entertainment; but it is a better thing to attend upon the Word than to entertain Chriſt in your houſes: You that are of loving diſpoſitions, that if a good Miniſter ſhall come to your houſes, or a good Chriſtian, that you ſee but the Image of Chriſt in, your hearts ſpring within you, and you will do any thing to entertain them: Well but what if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come, if you knew that ſuch a man that came within your doors were the Son of God, how would you beſtir your ſelves to entertain him? But know, it is a more acceptable ſervice to Jeſus Chriſt to attend upon his Word, than to provide for him in your houſes: And there is great reaſon too that we ſhould be diligent in drawing nigh to the Word, and give ear unto it; becauſe you find that the Lord doth expreſs
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104284:73"/>
himſelf in the Scripture, how he gives ear to us when we ſpeak to him. God is ſaid to encline His ear, ſometimes to open His ear, ſometimes to bow His ear, ſometimes to cauſe His ear to hear, and divers ſuch expreſſions there are to that purpoſe. Now if God when we that are poor wretches ſpeak to Him, ſhall bow His ear, bend His ear, open His ear, cauſe His ear to hear, much more ſhould we when we come to attend upon Him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly as there muſt be attending to the Word of God, ſo there muſt be an opening of the heart to receive what God ſpeaks to you; it is true, it is the work of God to open the heart, but God works upon men as upon rational creatures, and He makes you to be active in opening your hearts, ſo that when you have any truth come to be revealed, you ſhould open your underſtandings, your conſcience, and will, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Oh Lord, thy truth which thou art preſenting here to my ſoul at this time, let it come in, let me receive it, as the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>My Son, if thou wilt receive my words,</hi> and then in ver. 10. <hi>When wiſdom entereth into thy heart:</hi> The words of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Words of God, they muſt enter into the heart, get in; it may be they get into thy ear, but that's not enough, they muſt get into thy heart in <hi>Job.</hi> 8. 37. There Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that His Word had no place in them; that's a ſad thing when the Word of God ſhall have no place in the heart. If a temptation to ſin comes, that hath a place in the heart; but when the Word comes, that hath no place in the heart; I ſay, it is a very ſad thing that we can find no room for the Word; we ſhould get room for the Word, Open ye gates, <hi>Stand open ye everlaſting doors, that the King of Glory may come in:</hi> Know that when you come to hear the Word, the Lord is knocking at the doors of your hearts; have not you felt it ſometimes? Open, O open the doors, let all be opened to receive the Word into your hearts. That is the ſecond thing for the behavior of the ſoul in hearing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing is The careful applying of the word, ſo in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 2. There muſt be an applying of the heart to the word, and an applying of the word unto the heart. All action is by an application of the thing that doth act unto the ſubject, there muſt be an application of the word to thy ſoul, as now,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104284:74"/>
ſuppoſe thou comeſt to hear the Word, and thou heareſt of ſome ſin that it may be thou knoweſt thou art guilty of, take the Word, and lay it to thy heart and ſay, The Lord hath met with my ſoul this day, the Lord hath ſpoken to me, to the end that I might be humbled for this ſin, and the other ſin that my conſcience tells me I am guilty of: So, doth the Lord put thee upon a duty that concerns thee; acknowledge this, the Lord hath ſpoken to me this day, and put me upon the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of my family, and the reformation of mine own heart. Is there a word preſented? apply that, and let not the trouble of thy heart cauſe thee to caſt off that word that God hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to thee: The application of the word to thy heart is of mervelous uſe, and it concerns not only Miniſters in general, to lay before people the doctrin of the Goſpel, but to apply it; And know, that it concerns you as well as Miniſters to apply it; And not only when they come to that that is called Uſe, but all the way in the opening of the word, it concerns you all to apply it to your own ſouls, and to conſider how doth it concern me in particular? My brethren, there is no ſuch way to honor God, or get good to your own ſouls, as the application of the word unto your ſelves. As a man that is aſleep, if there be a noiſe made it will not awake him ſo ſoon, but come and call him by his name (and ſay, <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>Thomas,)</hi> and that will awake him ſooner than a greater noiſe will: So, when the word makes a noiſe when it is delivered only in the general, men take little notice of it; but when the word comes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the ſouls of men, and doth (as it were) call them by name, this awakens them: Now, God many times doth ſpeak to your hearts, but you ſhould apply it; you know the word is compared to meat, and it muſt be applied to the body, Then do we worſhip God in a right way when as we take notice of Gods word, as concerning us in particular; as that notable Scripture that you have in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 25. Where there come a poor man into the Church of God, and hears Propheſying, hears the word opened and the text ſaith, <hi>he is convinced of all, he is judged of all;</hi> and then in verſ. 25. <hi>Thus are the ſecrets of his heart manifeſt, and ſo falling down on his face he worſhips God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that God is in you of a truth:</hi> That is, when the word comes
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:104284:74"/>
and meets with his ſoul in particular, that he finds himſelf to be aim'd at by the Word, then he worſhips God, and ſaith that God certainly is in them. Here's the reaſon now that when you come to hear the Word, you do not worſhip God becauſe you apply it not to your ſelves, you are ready to ſay, This was well ſpoken to ſuch a one, and it concerns ſuch a one, but how doth it concern thy ſoul in particular? Sometimes the Lord doth even force men and women to apply it whether they will or no, for that they think the Miniſter ſpeaks to them in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and that no body was ſpoken too in the Congregation but themſelves; This is a mercy when the Lord doth it unto you; but it is a greater mercy when the Lord gives you a heart to apply to your ſelves, and although it may trouble you a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for the preſent, yet be willing to apply it, and account it a great mercy from the Lord, That the Lord will be pleaſed to ſpeak in particular to your ſouls.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, We muſt mix Faith with the Word, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will do us but little good; Apply it and then beleeve it. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. it is ſaid, that <hi>The Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> Wherefore there muſt be a mixture of Faith, to beleeve the Word that the Lord brings unto you. Now concerning that I'le but propound theſe few particulars;</p>
            <p>You will ſay, Muſt we beleeve every thing that is ſpoken? ſometimes there are ſome things ſpoken that we cannot tell how to beleeve?</p>
            <p>I do not mean ſo, to beleeve every thing meerly being ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for you muſt take heed <hi>what</hi> you hear, as well as <hi>how</hi> you hear; but do thus much at leaſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, Whatſoever comes in the Name of God to you, (except you know certainly it is not according to the written Word) you owe ſo much reſpect to it, as to examin it, at leaſt to try it whether it be ſo or no, as it is ſaid of thoſe Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred men that I ſpake of, that they did examin whether things were ſo or no. Do not caſt off any thing preſently that comes in the Name of God: Now any thing that hath the broad Seal upon it, you muſt not diſobey: You will ſay, It may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit: but do not diſobey it till you be ſure it be counterfeit.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104284:75"/>
Oh that men would give but this reſpect to all things that they hear, never to caſt them off till they have examined and tried whether they be ſo or no.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Do but grant this reſpect to the Word that is ſpoken to you, as to think thus, What if all that I hear ſpoken againſt my ſin, which laies open the dangerous condition that my ſoul is in, prove to be true, what a caſe were I in then? This hath been the beginning of the converſion of many ſouls, the having but ſuch a thought as this, It may be things are not ſo terrible as I hear, but what if they do prove ſo? then I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. Dare I venture my ſoul and my eternal eſtate upon hopes that theſe things are not ſo bad as I hear? I beleeve if you would put your ſelves to it, you would think it a bold adventure, and the comfort that any of you have grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, meerly hoping that things are not ſo bad as you hear; it is a curſed comfort that hath no ſure bottom: Grant that reſpect therefore to the Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly conſider this, It may be I do not ſee cleerly that theſe things are ſo which are delivered, I do not ſee enough to beleeve them now, but what if I were now dying? what if I were now going to receive the ſentence of my eternal doom; Would I not then beleeve theſe things? would I not then think what I hear out of the Word to be true? It is an eaſie matter for men to reject the Word while they have their healths, and proſperity; But if you were to die, and upon your ſick and death bed; if you ſaw the infinit Ocean of Eternity before you, what would you ſay then? were the Word true yea, or no? would you give belief unto the ſuggeſtions of the Devil then? We find it by exprience, That men that could eaſily caſt off the Word in their healths, yet when they have come to lie upon their ſick bed, and death bed, they found the Word true: Beleeve it now as well as then.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſider, If thou doeſt not beleeve, what a caſe art thou in? Am I worſe than the Devils themſelves? The Scripture tels me, <hi>That the Devils beleeve and tremble;</hi> Why Lord, do I come to hear Sermons, and am I more hard to beleeve than the very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils themſelves? They do beleeve that Word that I caſt off, and they tremble at it, but my ſoul is not at all ſtirred, as if
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104284:75"/>
there were no reallity in ſuch things that have been ſpoken to me. There be other things which may further help us towards beleeving of the Word of God, but theſe ſhall ſuffice: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly my brethren till we come to this, to beleeve the Word, though we ſhould ſit under it many yeers, it will do us little good, and we ſhall never ſanctifie the Name of God in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE next thing for the right behavior of the ſoul for ſanctifying Gods Name is this, We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Word with meekneſs of ſpirit, that you have in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Wherefore lay apart all filthineſs, and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs, and receive with meekneſs the ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Word which is able to ſave your ſouls. Receive with meekneſs;</hi> The former part of this Scripture I confeſs concerns ſomewhat that was before, about the preparation of the ſoul, and we ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps afterwards in the Application come to open the former part of this verſ. <hi>Lay apart all filthineſs, and ſuperfluity of naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> (But only now we quote the place for this,) <hi>Receive with meekneſ: the ingrafted Word which is able to ſave your ſouls.</hi> Let there be a quietneſs in your ſpirits in attending upon the Word, no hurrying: There is a twofold diſtemper of paſſion in many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is a great hindrance to the profit of the Word, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Gods Name in hearing it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is a diſtemper of paſſion in thoſe that have ſome trouble of concience in them, they are troubled for their ſin, and their ſpirits are in a diſcontented froward humor becauſe they have not that comfort that they do deſire, and therefore the Word of God when it come to be preached to them, if it doth not every way ſute with their hearts, and if they do not find preſent comfort by it, their ſpirits are in a diſtemper and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104284:76"/>
frowardneſs, and caſt it off; and if at any time there be never ſuch comfortable things ſpoken in the Word, yet there is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in their ſpirits becauſe they are not able to apply the word to themſelves, and they think, This doth not concern me: Now there ſhould be meekneſs of ſpirit in thoſe that are in trouble of conſcience above all; they ſhould quietly attend upon the Word, and wait for the time that God will ſpeak peace to their conſciences: And if I cannot find the Word ſutable to me at this time, yet I may at another time: let me attend with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let me receive every thing with meekneſs; the Word is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove me, and if ever I have good, it muſt be by the Word at laſt. It doth much concern thoſe that are in trouble of conſcience to have meek ſpirits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is another diſtemper in others, and that is worſe; that is, Such as when they find the Word come neer unto them, relating thoſe ſins that their conſciences tells them they are guilty of, their hearts riſe againſt God and His Word, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters too: becauſe it would pluck away ſome beloved cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, becauſe it rebukes them for ſome haunt of evil, ſome diſtemper of heart that they have been or are guilty of, it puts a ſhame upon them, and therefore their hearts do riſe againſt it. It is a dreadful thing to have the heart riſe againſt the Word. As we reade of that froward Prince <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> in the Propheſie of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that when the Roll was read in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, (ſitting in the winter time by a great fire) he took a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife and cut it in pieces and threw it into the fire in anger: and I have read that the Jews kept a Faſt every yeer to mourn for that great ſin, and yet this <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> was the ſon of <hi>Joſiah</hi> whoſe heart did melt at the hearing of the Word, he had an humble and meek heart when the Law was read, and yet ſee what a different ſpirit <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> had either from his Father or Grand-Father. It is a great diſhonor to the Name of God for men to give liberty to their paſſions to riſe againſt the Word; take heed of paſſion either while you are hearing the Word, or after the Word; as many of you while you are diſcontented with what is ſaid, when you come in company, what a fury are many men in upon the hearing of ſome things in the Word that comes cloſe to their hearts; Remember when you are hearing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104284:76"/>
of the Word, that it is that which is above you, and it is not fit for one that is an inferior to ſhew himſelf paſſionate in the preſence of a Superior: It is true, the Miniſters they may be in as low a condition as you, and in a lower; but the Word they ſpeak, it is above all the Princes and Monarchs upon the face of the Earth; and it is fit therefore, we having to deal with God, that we ſhould behave our ſelves in a meek diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The next thing for the ſanctifying Gods Name in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Word, is this, We muſt hear it with a trembling heart, with fear as well as meekneſs, and for that you have that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Scripture, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. beginning, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, The Heaven is my Throne, and the earth is my Foot-ſtool, where is the houſe that the build unto me, and where is the place of my reſt? For all thoſe things hath my hand made, and all thoſe things have been, ſaith the Lord; but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my Word.</hi> This is a moſt admirable Scripture: Mark how God lifts up himſelf in his Glory, ſo great a God, as the Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my Foot-ſtool, where is that houſe that ye will build unto me? But then may a poor ſoul ſay, How ſhall I be able to ſtand before this God that is ſo glorious? Saith God, Be not diſcouraged poor ſoul who doeſt tremble at my Word, for I look to you. And then this is a further thing obſervable, That God hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that ſoul that trembles at this Word, rather than to any that ſhould build the moſt ſumptuous buildings in the world for him; for ſaith God here, The Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth is my Foot-ſtool, where is the houſe that ye build un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and where is the place of my reſt? They have built a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Temple to God, but what do I regard that ſaith God? I regard one that trembls at my Word more than that great houſe that you have built unto me. It is a notable Scripture to ſhew what a high reſpect God hath to one that trembles at his Word, he regards them more than this glorious Temple that was built unto him; If you were able to build ſuch a place as this was for the ſervice of God, you would think it a great matter, it is not ſo much regarded as if you could bring a trembling heart to Gods Word, that's a ſpecial thing wherein the ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104284:77"/>
of the Name of God conſiſts, when we come to ſee the dreadful Authority that there is in the Word of God, when we are able to ſee more Glory of God in his Word than in all the works of God beſides, for there is more of his Glory in the Word than there is in the whol Creation of Heaven and Earth, take the Sun, and Moon, and Stars: you that are Marriners, you have ſeen much of the Glory of God abroad, that one would think might ſtrike terror into all your hearts, but know, That there is more of the dreadfulneſs of Gods Name in his Word than in all his Works; In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. 2. <hi>Thou haſt magnified thy Word above all thy Name;</hi> the Word it is magnified above all the Name of God whatſoever, and it is a very good ſign of a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al enlightened ſoul that can ſee the Name of God more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Word than in al his Works beſides; I appeal unto your conſciences in this thing, Have you ever ſeen the Name of God to be more magnified in his Word than in all his Works; I may with very good confidence affirm this, That there is no godly ſoul upon the face of the Earth, that hath the weakeſt degree of grace, but hath ſeen more of the glory of God revealed in his Word, than he hath ſeen in all the VVorks of God beſides, and his heart hath been more taken with it, It requires therefore a trembling frame of heart when we hear it.</p>
            <p>And then further, When this is conſidered that the word is that which bindeth the ſoul over, either to life or death, mens eternal eſtates are to be caſt by the word, certainly then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a trembling heart to hear that by which the eternal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of man is to be caſt, we do not ſanctifie Gods Name when we come to hear the word, except we come with trembling hearts, and they are the moſt likely of all men and women to underſtand the mind of God; as for ſuch as come with concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpirits that they underſtand as much before they come, and think their reach of wit or capacity is beyond the capacity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſhall open the word unto them (yet that were not ſo much if it did but only reſt upon the man, and not reflect upon the word it ſelf.) Now theſe that are rich in their own thoughts and underſtandings are ſent empty away, but thoſe that come with trembling hearts to the word, they are the men that are like to underſtand Gods Counſels revealed in his word. In
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104284:77"/>
               <hi>Ezra.</hi> 10. 2, 3. Shechaniah <hi>the Son of</hi> Jehiel <hi>one of the Sons of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam <hi>anſwered and ſaid unto</hi> Ezra, <hi>We have tranſgreſſed againſt our God &amp; have taken ſtrang wives &amp;c. Yet now there is hope ni Iſrael concerning this thing, now therefore let us make a Covenant with our God according to the counſel of my Lord, and of thoſe that tremble at the Commandement of our God;</hi> So that thoſe that tremble at Gods Word and ſuch as are fitteſt to counſel, they underſtand moſt of Gods mind; and that's another particular of the behavior of the ſoul in ſanctifying Gods Name in hearing His Word.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The next is a humble ſubjection to the Word that we hear, our hearts muſt bow to it, muſt lie under the Word that we hear, it is a very remarkable Scripture that we have in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 12. There it is ſaid concerning a great King, <hi>Zedekiah, He did that which was evil in the ſight of the Lord, his God, and humbled not himſelf before</hi> Jeremiah <hi>the Prophet, ſpeaking from the mouth of the Lord.</hi> It is a very ſtrange expreſſion as any we have in the Book of God, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> a great King ſhould be charged with this as a great ſin, that he did not humble himſelf, Humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, before whom you will ſay? We are bound to humble our ſelves before God, but here it is that he did not humble himſelf before <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet; Why before the Prophet? <hi>Becauſe he ſpake from the mouth of the Lord.</hi> If it be any meſſenger that ſpeaks from the mouth of the Lord, God expects that we ſhould humble our ſelves, ſo that if any truth comes to be delivered unto you, the Lord expects that you ſhould fall down and yeild obedience to it, whatſoever your thoughts, your judgments, your opinions have heretofore been, if there come any thing in the Word againſt it you muſt ſubmit your judgments, ſubmit your very conſciences, you muſt ſubmit your wills, whatſoever your hearts have been ſet upon, though it hath been never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentful to your ſpirits before, yet now ſubmit, and yeild though it go never ſo croſs unto your minds, your wills, your ends, yet all muſt be ſubmitted, and laid down flat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Word, ſo as to be willing to deny your ſelves of any thing in the world. When a man or woman can ſay thus, Lord it is true, I confeſs before I heard thy word opened in the evidence and demonſtration or the Spirit unto me, I was of ſuch a mind, and my heart went after ſuch and ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104284:78"/>
and I thought it was impoſſible that ever my heart ſhould be taken from them but O Lord thou haſt been pleaſed plainly to ſhew to me by the opening of thy Word in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thy Spirit, what thy mind is; Now whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of my name, of my comforts, of my contentments in this world, Lord, here I caſt down al before thee, I ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Word; this is a gracious frame. Now is the Name of God extol'd, and lifted up in hearing of the Word, the Name of God is ſanctified in ſuch a word of ſpirit as this is. I have read of a German Divine writing to <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> another famous Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Divine, he hath this expreſſion, Oh let the Word of God come, and though we had 600 necks we would all ſubmit them unto the Word of God ſaith he. So it ſhould be the temper of ſuch as hear the Word and deſire to ſanctifie Gods Name in it, let the Word of God come this morning, let God ſpeak and we will ſubmit had we 600. necks, we will ſubmit all we are, or have, to this Word of the Lord, it is the Word of God, that we are willing ſhould triumph over us: To have a Congregation to lie down under the Word of God that is preached to them is a moſt excellent thing, and Gods Name is much ſanctified; we do not brethren deſire you ſhould lie under us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are not only willing, but we are very deſirous that you would examin what we ſpeak to you, whether it be according to the Word of God or no. But look to it, that if we do ſpeak to you that which is the Word from the mouth of the Lord know then that God expects that you ſhould ſubmit your eſtates, your ſouls, your bodies, all that you are and have to this Word, and that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother particular in the ſanctifying of the Name of God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Word; there muſt be an humble ſubmiſſion of the ſoul unto it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Another particular, wherein the behavior, of the ſoul for the ſanctifying of Gods Name conſiſts is this, the Word it muſt be received with love, and with joy, it is not enough for you to be convinc'd of the authority of it, and to think thus, well I muſt yield to it, this is the Word of God and if I do not yield to it I muſt expect the plagues and judgments of God to follow it: that is not enough, but you moſt yield to it with love, and with joy; except you receive the Word with love
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104284:78"/>
and with joy it is not ſanctified; you do not ſanctifie Gods Name, nor is it ſanctified unto you. You muſt receive the Word, not only as the <hi>true</hi> Word of the Lord, but as the <hi>good</hi> Word of the Lord. In <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10. we find it to be the cauſe of mens being given over to a ſpirit of deluſion, <hi>becauſe they received not the Word of God in love:</hi> It is ſpoken of Antichriſt, that at his coming, he ſhall come with all deceivableneſs, and he ſhal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them that periſh: Who are they? <hi>They that receive not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved.</hi> It is not enough my Brethren, to receive the truth that we might be ſaved, but we muſt receive the love of the truth if ever we would be ſaved: Good is the Word of the Lord to my ſoul. And we muſt receive it with <hi>joy</hi> too as well as with <hi>love; Prov.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>When wiſdom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth into thy heart, and knowledge is pleaſant unto thy ſoul; then diſcretion ſhall preſerve thee, underſtanding ſhall keep thee, &amp;c.</hi> That is a great matter, when the Word reveals ſome truth to thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and thou canſt ſo receive it as it ſhould be pleaſant to thy ſoul, that thy ſoul rejoyces in it; it is a good Word it is that which doth me good at the heart: When a people can hear the Word, and the Word coming near unto them they can ſay, This Word doth me good at the heart, it is pleaſant to my ſoul; that is excellent. In <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41 the godly are deſcribed, (thoſe that did receive the Word, ſo as to ſanctifie Gods Name in it) by this, <hi>That they gladly received the Word, and were baptized: and the ſame day there were added unto them about three thouſand ſouls.</hi> There were three thouſand in one day that did gladly receive the Word: What an Auditory had <hi>Peter</hi> at this time! Then the Word it did them good, when they gladly received it.</p>

And</hi> Herod, <hi>it is ſaid of him, That be heard</hi> John Baptiſt <hi>gladly. It ſeems then that it is not enough to receive it with gladneſs?</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I Anſwer, Firſt, There muſt be that which Hypocrites may have, if there be want of that, we cannot ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie Gods Name. But you will ſay, <hi>We muſt go further, or elſe Gods Name is not ſanctified.</hi> That I confeſs: Therefore when I ſpeak of gladneſs and joy, know, that I mean another kind of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104284:79"/>
joy than the ſtony ground had; and ſo certainly the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is ſpoken of in <hi>Prov.</hi> which I mentioned before; And the gladneſs that the three thouſand did receive the Word withal, is different from the gladneſs of the ſtony ground. If you ask me, wherein it differs? I would anſwer, it differs thus The gladneſs of an Hypocrite in receiving Gods Word, it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth either from the novelty of it, becauſe it is a new thing, and he gets new notions that he had not before; or elſe he is joyful from ſome other carnal excellencies that he finds going together with the Word, ſome Eſteem, or Honor that he ſhall get by it, ſome ſelviſhneſs there is that makes his heart to be glad, for there is a great deal of natural and carnal excellency that goes along many times with the Word. But now this gladneſs that is ſpoken of in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> it is the gladneſs that ariſeth from the apprehenſion of the Spiritual excellencies that there is in the Word, as that it is that Word that reveals God and Chriſt to my ſoul; that word that comes neereſt to my ſoul, to the mortifying of my luſts, and the Sanctifying of my heart: This is that which makes me rejoyce in the Word, the holineſs and the Spiritual excellency that I ſee to be in the Word: <hi>Thy Word is pure</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and therefore doth thy ſervant love it, and rejoyce in it.</hi> This no Hypocrite can ſay; I ſee the Image of God in his Word, I ſee the very glaſs of Gods holineſs in the word, I feel that in the word that may bring my ſoul to God, wherein my ſoul enjoys communion with God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and it is this that glads my ſoul. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the word with joy thus, we ſhall come to ſanctifie the Name of God in hearing of it. And that's the Eighth Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Ninth Particular is this, If we would ſanctifie the Name of God in his word, <hi>We muſt receive the Word into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hearts.</hi> This you have in <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15. the parable of the Sower; you ſhall find there, that there are divers grounds that do receive the Seed; and by thoſe divers grounds are meant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of hearers: There is firſt the high-way ground, that is, Such as hear the word, and never regard what they hear, and aſſoon as ever they go out of the Congregation, the ſeed of the word is quite gone, and is as if they had not heard at all. And
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104284:79"/>
then there is the ſtony ground, and the thorny ground, that is, thoſe that hear with joy (as was ſpoken of before) but the cares of the world choak the ſeed of the Word; as ſoon as ever they are gone, they are upon their worldly buſineſs, and their thoughts and hearts runs that way. But then there is the good ground, that is, Thoſe that receive the Seed of the Word into a good and honeſt heart; a good and an honeſt heart they are both ioyned together: By a good heart is meant, a heart that hath no malice in it, a heart that doth deſire to empty it ſelf of every thing that is againſt the Word, and which is not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the ſpiritualneſs of the Word: A heart (I ſay) that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains nothing in it that any way makes againſt the Word, <hi>A good heart</hi> is a heart (which as the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. and that place may very well come in here to be opened) is <hi>clenſed from all ſilthineſs and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs.</hi> The Word that is there tranſlated <hi>ſilthineſs.</hi> it ſignifies Excrements: that which is unclean, that which comes from the body, ſuch is the ſinfulneſs of your hearts; you come to hear the Word, if it be with evil hearts you mingle that very filthineſs which is as vile before God as excrements are, <hi>And ſuperfluity of naughtineſs;</hi> by that I take is meant, as if the holy Ghoſt ſhould ſay, Do not think it enough for to purge away filthineſs, that is, notorious ſtinking evils, abominable ſins, that you do not come with ſuch filthy vile hearts, but whatſoever there is in your heart that is any way againſt the Word of Grace, it is a ſuperfluity of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, all kind of evil thoughts, and evil affections that are more than needs. Look into your hearts and affections, and ſee whatſoever you find there that is more than ought to be, running out unto any thing that they ſhould not, labor to purge out that ſaith he, do not ſatisfie your ſelves in any kind of evil whatſoever: it may be you are clenſed from the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evils of the world: but if there remains any naughtineſs, any kind of droſſineſs in your hearts that is not grace, it is to be purged out, for it is ſuperfluity: So then that is a good heart that entertains no kind of evil in it, It may be there is ſome evil, but it doth deſire to purge out, not only that that is ſilthy, naſty, and abominable; but if there be any thing that ſhould not be there, a good heart is againſt it. And that is a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104284:80"/>
good heart that is willing to receive any thing that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals; as we uſe to ſay, Such a man is a good man; that is, you can propound nothing to him that is fit to be done, but he is willing to hearken to you. A good man he hath no kind of evil ends in him, no evil deſigns at all, but he is willing to hearken to every thing that is good: So, a good heart whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is good he is ready to entertain, if it be a good thing his heart is ſutable to it, and runs preſently unto it; having a good heart it doth preſently cloſe with the good Word of the Lord.</p>
            <p>But what is meant by an <hi>Honeſt Heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>honeſty of heart,</hi> certainly there is more meant than ſuch a one that we call an honeſt man, that is, a man that is honeſt in his dealings between man and man; there is many a man that is accounted a very honeſt man in the world, but hath not an honeſt heart: I beſeech you obſerve it, That man that hath an honeſt heart to God, is one that receives the ſeed of the Word, ſo as he goes beyond the high-way ground, the ſtony ground, or the thorny ground, he goes beyond thoſe three ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors; he is one that hath an emenency in profeſſion of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beyond thoſe three: Now the world accounts many honeſt men that do not go beyond any of thoſe three; yea, the world doth ordinarily account any of thoſe three to be honeſt men; As the high-way ground, Are there not many honeſt men in the world, that regard not the Word of God at all, but only come to hear a Sermon, and aſſoon as they have done, as it came in at one ear, ſo it goes out at the other? I fear there are ſome men and women that are accounted honeſt men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the world, that can hardly give an accompt of any one Sermon they have heard in all their lives; hardly, I ſay, but the Word which they heard is preſently taken away from them; and yet theſe are accounted honeſt men in the world: But this is not the honeſt heart the Scripture ſpeaks of. And many there are that go further than theſe, that come to hear the Word with joy, and yet they have not this honeſt heart: Yea, they may hear the Word ſo as to bring forth a Blade, and yet not have this honeſt heart. But this honeſt heart I take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be meant this: An heart that deals ſquarely and truly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104284:80"/>
with God, behaving it ſelf in a beſeeming manner ſutable to that Authority and Excellency that there is in the Word of God. As now for Example:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Among men, he is accounted an honeſt man that deals ſquarely and truly with men in all actions; ſuch a man you will ſay, is an honeſt man, as honeſt a man as ever broke bread; that is, one that will deal ſquarely with men, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one thing, but turn him to any thing, and you ſhall find a proportion between one action and another: So this is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heart, not one that only will be forward for God in ſome one action wherein he may enjoy himſelf as well as God; but one that deals ſquarely with God, let God put him upon duty, upon any ſervice, God ſhall find him ſtill to be the ſame man: Put him upon any eaſie ſervice (as many will imbrace that) or put him upon a difficult ſervice, it is all one if it be the mind of God; you ſhall find him ſquare in every thing, though he be put upon that which he is like to ſuffer very much in, yet he goes on according to his principles. An honeſt heart is one that hath received gracious principles, and accordingly he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, all the world cannot take him off from his principles of godlineſs that the Lord hath put into his heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, An honeſt man is one that provides things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt before men, that doth all things in a ſeemly way in all thoſe relations that he hath unto others, that we account ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty: So when a mans behavior towards the Word is ſuch as doth beſeem the Word of that God with whom he hath to deal, That look what excellency, what glory there is in the Word of God, ſuch a ſutable behavior there is in the heart of a man to it, this is an honeſt heart. So that there are thoſe two things, when a man is ſquare with God in one thing as well as another, and when there is a ſutableneſs in the behavior of the ſoul to what excellency there is in the Word, when the heart of man will not abuſe the Word at all, but behaves it ſelf honeſtly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto the gravity, holineſs, and weight that there is in the Word. And thus now with ſuch a good and honeſt heart we are to receive the Word if we will ſanctifie Gods Name in it.</p>
            <p n="10">10. A tenth particular is this, If we will ſanctifie Gods Name
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104284:81"/>
in the Word, we muſt hide the Word in our hearts, we muſt not only hear the Word, but keep it, preſerve it, and then we do declare that we account the Word of God to be worth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing indeed; For, what is it to ſanctifie God (as we have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before in the General) but ſuch a behavior towards him, as may teſtifie the Excellency of the Name of God ſo the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior of the ſoul in hearing the Word, muſt be ſuch as muſt give a teſtimony to the Excellency of the Word, and manifeſt the high eſteem I have of it. Now if I received a thing that is of great value, if I ſlight it, and let any body take it from me, I do not give a teſtimony of the excellency of that thing; but if I take it and lock it up, and keep it under lock and key, I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by give a teſtimony of the eſteem that I have of the excellency of that thing: So now, when I come to hear the Word, and meet with Truths that I have gotten into my ſoul, I cloſe with them, and am reſolved within my heart as I am hearing of them, well, This Truth I will keep through Gods Grace, this concerns me, and I will make much of it, and although I forget other things, yet I hope I ſhall remember this, To ſanctifie Gods Name in hearing of the Word: In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 23. <hi>Hear</hi> (ſaith the holy Ghoſt there) <hi>for the time to come.</hi> When we come to the Word, we muſt not only hearken for the preſent, as many of us while we are hearing, our hearts are ſtir'd for the preſent; Oh that we could but have that affection of heart alwaies, as we have when we are hearing of the Word! How many of you have ſaid when you have been hearing ſuch a Sermon, Oh! then me thought I could have gone through fire and water for God? I, but mark it, you muſt hear <hi>for afterwards.</hi> And in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 11. there the Prophet <hi>David</hi> profeſt, That he did hide the Word in his heart, the Word was ſweet unto him; <hi>Thy Word</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee.</hi> You that come and hear thoſe Truths upon the Lords day, if you would hide them thus in your hearts, and keep them all the week, they would help you againſt the many temptations that you meet withal; you go abroad on the week daies into company, and there you meet with a temptation, and it overcomes you, and you complain, Alas! I am weak, I have met with a temptation and it hath foil'd me: But had you hid the Word that you
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:104284:81"/>
heard on the Lords day in your heart, it would have kept you from the ſtrength of your temptation that it ſhould not have overcome you. Thoſe that are truly godly they have a care to hide the word in their hearts; when they hear it they think, This word ſhall help me againſt ſuch and ſuch ſins which I am prone to by nature, and when a temptation comes to that ſin I hope I ſhall have uſe of the word that I have heard this day; As now, Suppoſe you hear a word againſt paſſion, then you ſhould hide that word in your hearts againſt that time that temptation comes to paſſion. And you hear a word againſt ſenſuality, and abuſe of the creatures; you ſhould hide that word againſt that temptation cometh. And you hear a word againſt unrighteouſneſs and unjuſt dealings; when a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes to that ſin you ſhould hide that word againſt that time. So, you hear a word that ſpeaks of obedience to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and ſervants duties to Governors, now you ſhould hide that word in your hearts againſt that time; <hi>I have hid thy word in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee,</hi> You ſay, that you would fain withſtand and not be overcome with temptations: Then here's the way, Hide the word within thee, that thou maieſt not ſin againſt him. And ſo in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 1. you have a Scripture to the ſame purpoſe, about hiding the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments within us. And then in 1 <hi>John,</hi> 2. 14. I <hi>write unto you yong men becauſe you are ſtrong, and the Word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wiched one.</hi> I have written unto you yong men, you are yong, you have ſtrong natures, and ſo ſtrength of nature for God: But how comes this to paſs? <hi>You are ſtrong, and the Word of God abideth in you:</hi> Here is an excellent Scripture for all yong men, you have your memories freſh, and if you will exerciſe your memories about any thing, it ſhould be in the word of God; it is a comly and an excellent thing to ſee yong ones to have the word of God abiding in them, that if you come to them, not only a week, but a month after they have heard the word, they are able to give you an account of it I am verily perſwaded that there are many yong ones in this place, that are able to give you old ones (if you ask them) an account of what it is to ſanctifie Gods Name in the Duties of worſhip; And why? Becauſe the word of God abideth in them. It is the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104284:82"/>
honor of yong men to have the Word of God to abide in them and hereby <hi>they overcome the wicked one.</hi> And on the other ſide, many yong people that do come to hear the Word, it may be they are drawn to it by others, or it may be they love to have a walk in the morning, but the Word of God abideth not in them, and therefore when the wicked one comes with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the week after they are overcome by him; but thoſe that have the Word of God abiding in them they overcome the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one. And ſo in <hi>Job.</hi> 8. 31. you have a very remarkable Scripture for this purpoſe of keeping the Word after we have heard it. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus to thoſe which beleeved on Him, if you continue in my Word then are you my Diſciples indeed.</hi> I beſeech you obſerve it, It is ſaid that the Jews did beleeve in Chriſt, and yet ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If you continue in my Word then are you my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> why were they not the Diſciples of Chriſt that did beleeve in him? By this beleeving therefore we muſt underſtand ſome kind of general notion that they had of Chriſt, they began to think that Chriſt might be the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſome kind of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect beleeving they had, but they were not throughly brought off, now ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If you continue in my Word, you are my Diſciples.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Do not you think it enough that you come to here me, and that you are taken by what I ſay; you muſt continue in my Word, and then you are my Diſciples: Chriſt will not own that man or woman to be his Diſciple that doth not continue in His Word. O that you would conſider of this, you that ſatisfie your ſelves in having ſome flaſhes of your affections when you are heating the Word, but do not think that you are the Diſciples of Chriſt becauſe of them, In <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Holding faſt the faithful Word as you have been taught,</hi> that is the thing you ſhould labor for, to hold faſt the faithful Word, hold it faſt, that it may not be taken from you, and ſo you ſhall come to Sanctifie the Name of God in the hearing of his Word.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The laſt that I ſhall ſpeak to is this, If thou wouldeſt Sanctifie the Name of God in hearing His Word, turn it into practice, or otherwiſe the Name of God is blaſphemed, or at leaſt is taken in vain by thee if thou doeſt not turn what thou heareſt into practice; So you have it in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>He that is</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:104284:82"/>
               <hi>not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the Word, this man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</hi> And verſ. 22. <hi>Be ye doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own ſelves.</hi> The word here that is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>Deceiving your own ſelves,</hi> it's a word taken from Logicians, and ſignifies to make a falſe Sylogiſme. A man that hears the Word and doth not do it, he doth as it were reaſon thus, Thoſe that do come to Church (as we uſe to ſay) thoſe ſurely are Religious people, but I come to Sermons and therefore I am Religious: Now this is a falſe reaſoning, and thou doeſt but cozen thy ſelf. Be not a hearer only, but a doer of the Word, that thou maieſt not deceive thine own ſoul. So in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Thinkeſt thou this O man that judgeſt them that do ſuch things, &amp; doeſt the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the Judgment of God?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, You have the word, and you are able o judg thereby what you hear, but yet ſtill you are wicked in your lives: this is deſpiſing of the riches of the goodneſs of God towords you. And in <hi>Philippians,</hi> 2, 16. you have a remarkable text where the holy Ghoſt ſaith of the Phylippians, That he would have them <hi>hold forth the Word of Life.</hi> It were a moſt excellent thing if it might be ſaid of this Congregation, that as they come deligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear, and are willing to take pains to get out of their beds ſo early in the mornings, ſo all the week after they hold forth the word of God. You that are ſervants it may be your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are naught, and the families naught from whence you come; now when you go home, though it may be they will not let you repeat the Sermon, yet you are to hold forth the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in your practice and converſation: How is the Name of God glorified when we hold forth His Word! this is to let, not only your <hi>light ſhine,</hi> but the light of the word ſhine <hi>before men</hi> that they may belold it <hi>and glorifie your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that now put all theſe Eleven Particulars together, and then you have made good that expreſſion we find in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. <hi>That the Word of God was glorified.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe we have another expreſſion in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3 1. <hi>Finally, bretheren, Pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may have free courſe, and be glorified e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it is with you.</hi> This is the commendation of a people, that they do glorifie the Word of God: I beſeech you brethren, in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104284:83"/>
the Name of Jeſus Chriſt this morning that you that are hearers of the Word would glorifie the Word, and glorifie the Name of God in the Word; Oh that not one of you would be a diſgrace or ſhame to the Word of God; this is the charge that God this morning laies upon you, as ever you expect to receive any good from the Word, or to look upon the face of God with comfort whoſe Word this is: do not be a ſhame to His Word, and to the Miniſters of His Word. Put all theſe things together, I ſay and learn to make conſcience of ſanctifying Gods Name in hearing the Word, that ſo there may be none of you that may give any juſt occaſion to others to ſay, Is this to hear Sermons? Do you get nothing elſe but this by hearing Sermons? If you ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the mouths of men to ſay ſo of you, the Word of God (as much as lies in you) would be diſgraced by you; you ſhould rather think thus, It were better for me that I ſhould die, and that I were under the ground and rotting there, than that the Word of God ſhould ever be diſgraced by me: Let me hold forth the glory of the Word, the Word is that which hath done good to my ſoul; the Word is that which I would not for ten thouſand worlds but have heard it, and ſhall I diſgrace this Word? ſhall I give any occaſion that this Word of the Lord ſhould be ſpoken ill of by reaſon of me? O God forbid. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you regard not your ſelves and your own honor, yet regard the honor of the word; If ever you have got any good by the word, you ſhould go away with this reſolution, well, I will labor all the daies of my life to honor this word of God that I have got ſo much good by: If this were but the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every one of your hearts this morning, it would be a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mornings work.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW follow the Reaſons why God ſtands ſo much upon it, That he will have his Name Sanctified in this Ordinance of hearing his Word.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, It is becauſe there is ſo much of God in his Word, and therefore we ſhould Sanctifie Gods Name. If it were poſſible there could be ſin in Heaven, that ſin would be greater than ſin committed here; therefore the ſin of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels when they were in Gods preſence, in a more ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was the greater: The Name of God being in any thing, the greater will be the evil, if we do not ſanctifie Gods Name in it; now there is very much of God in his Word, more of God there than in all the Works of Creation and Providence. In <hi>Pſ.</hi> 138. 2 <hi>Thou haſt magnified thy Word above all thy Name.</hi> There being therefore ſo much of God in his Word, we muſt ſanctifie the Name of God in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, God hath appointed His Word to be the great Ordinance to convey the ſpecial mercies that He intends for the good of His People. That we ſpake to before in the general, in ſhewing how the duties of Gods Worſhip are as a Channel for the conveyance of Special good to the Saints: But none more than the Word, that's the Ordinance to convey the firſt Grace to thoſe that belong to Gods election. The Sacraments is for ſtrengthening, and therefore there is rather more in the Word than in the Sacrament, and yet every one thinks in conſcience that he is bound to come carefully to the Sacrament, and to look to Sanctifie Gods Name there. It is an eaſier matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince men and women, that they are bound to ſanctifie the Name of God when they come to receive the holy Communion, than for the hearing of the Word: they think not ſo much of that, but certainly the Word is appointed to be an Ordinance
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104284:84"/>
of conveying more bleſſing than the Sacrament, becauſe it is appointed to convey the firſt Grace, and to convey ſtrength of Grace as well as the Sacrament: Now being appointed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey ſuch great things to the ſouls of the elect, both the firſt grace and ſtrengthening of grace, and comfort, and aſſiſtance thereof, the Lord expects to have his name ſantifiied in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The name of God muſt be Sanctiffed in the Word, becauſe the word is very quick and lively, it works men or women to life or death, to ſalvation or damnation. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>The word of God quick and powerfull, and ſharper than any two edged ſword, piercing even to the deviding a ſunder of ſoul and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c.</hi> It is very quick of operation (the text ſaith;) that is when God hath to deal with men by His Word, He wil not ſtand dallying and trifling with them, but he is very quick with them either to bring there ſoules to life, or to caſt them away. <hi>The time of mens ignorance God winks at, but now he cals all men to repent.</hi> Let them look to it now, God did forbeare in the time of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but He will not forbear ſo when the word comes, <hi>Now is the Ax laid to the root of the tree:</hi> And when was that? when <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> came to preach repentance, becauſe the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is at hand. though the tree were barren before, and did not bring ſorth good ſruit, yet it might ſtand ſtill and not be cut down; but when the powerfull miniſtration of the World comes, then the Ax is laid to the root of the Tree: either now come in and be ſaved, or reſiſt the Word and periſh: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is very obſervable when Chriſt ſends out His Diſciples to preach, in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. Saith he, <hi>Go ye into al the world and preach the Goſpel to every creature, and he that beleeveth and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved? but he that beleeveth not ſhall be damned:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, there ſhall be quick work made with them, go &amp; preach, &amp; thoſe that belong to my election ſhal be brought in to beleeve and be ſaved, and the others ſhall be damned: As if God ſhould ſay, If they will come in and imbrace the Goſpel they ſhall be ſaved, if they wil not they ſhall be damned, and there is an end of them. So that I ſay, we have need to look to it that we Sanctifie the name of God in His Word upon theſe Three Grounds, Becauſe there is ſo much of God in His Word Becauſe he hath appointed it to convey the greateſt Mercies to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104284:84"/>
His Saints. And becauſe God is very quick in His Word, one way or other.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now proceed to the Application of this Point: And,</p>
            <p>Firſt by way of reprehenſion to all thoſe that do not ſanctifie Gods Name in hearing the Word; and herein we ſhal ſhew their feareful condition, and how God will Sanctifie His Name upon them in waies of judgment, and then when we come to the uſe of Exhortation, to exhort you to ſanctifie the Name of God, there we ſhall ſhew you likewiſe how God will ſanctifie His Name in waies of mercy upon thoſe that do ſanctifie Him in waies of obedience in Hearing of His Word.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the firſt, Certainly if that be to ſanctſfie the Name of God that we have ſpoken of; Gods Name is but very little ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by people that do come to hear His Word, and we have no cauſe to wonder that there is ſo little good got by the Word, becauſe there are ſo few that make conſcience to ſanctifie Gods Name in hereing it; Some there are that are ſo far from ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Gods Name in it, as they altogether neglect it, and make it a matter of nothing whether they come to hear it or no: Saith Chriſt in <hi>Job.</hi> 8. 47. <hi>He that is of God heareth my Word, ye therefore hear them not becauſe ye are not of God.</hi> Certainly he that hath the knowledg of God, and any intereſt in God, and that belongs unto Him, nothing is more ſweet to him than the hearing of His Word, but becauſe <hi>ye are not of God</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>Therefore you hear not his Word.</hi> Thoſe men and women that have no intereſt in God, but live without God in this world, they regard not to hear His Word. O how many have we that belong to this place that do ſo! How many live without God in the world, and do declare to all the world that they are not of God? they have no part nor portion in God in that they hear not His W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some there are that come to hear it, but they come to hear it as a meer matter of indifferency, in a meer formal and cuſtomary way, or for companies ſake, or to give content to others: Theſe are poor and low ends, thou ſhouldeſt come to hear the Word, as expecting God ſhould ſpeak to thy ſoul for the furtherance of thy eternal good; but your conſciences may tell you what vain and wandring heart you have, when you
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:104284:85"/>
come to hear it. <hi>The eyes of the fool</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) are in all the corners of the earth,</hi> up and down wandring, little minding that you are to com to hear God Himſelf ſpeak to you in the Miniſtry of man. And if ſo be that it be minded, yet ordinarily the hearts of men do put off the Word, and if it come any thing neer to them they think to ſhift it from themſelves to others. We have a notable Scripture in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. for ſuch men as ſhift off Gods Word when it comes many times very neer to them: <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from Him which ſpeaketh from Heaven:</hi> See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaks the Word, ſee that you do not put him off: And that is the ſignification of it: if you compare it with <hi>Luke,</hi> 12. 18. you ſhould find that there is the ſame word uſed, where ſpeaking of thoſe that were invited to the ſupper, it is ſaid, <hi>They all with one conſent began to make excuſe;</hi> they began to ſhift it off, that is the ſame word. Oh take heed of this, that when you are hearing the Word and Chriſt comes and ſpeaks to your hearts, and you begin to think that it way concern you, and your conſciences begin to ſtir, take heed that you do not ſhift him off, take heed that you do not put away the Word from you by any kind of pretence whatſoever. (It may be) you will ſay, If I were certain it were the Word of God, and that God ſpake to me, God forbid but that I ſhould ſubmit unto it. But though it may be the hearts of men are not ſo notoriouſly rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious as to reſolve to ſin againſt the Word, which they will acknowledg to be the Word of God, yet this is the deceit of the heart, when the heart hath no mind to obey, it will ſhift off the Word, and have pretences and put-offs, Oh take heed that you do not ſhift off him that ſpeaks from Heaven, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any kind of excuſe whatſoever, but when thou heareſt, if the Word of God come to thy conſcience, do not liſten to vain reaſonings that are againſt it. Others there are that cannot tell how to ſhift off the Word, but it will come upon them when they are hearing; it may be they are a little ſtir'd, but it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gone, ſo that they are far from holding the Word, far from keeping it in their hearts. Oh! How many of you have been ſtir'd when you have been hearing the Word! and how
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104284:85"/>
happy had it been for you if you had hid thoſe words in your heart that the Lord hath ſpoken to you in the Miniſtry of it. If you had but the Invitations of the Spirit now, that ſometimes you have had, how happy were it for you? But it is with many in hearing the word, juſt as with you Marriners when you are to go abroad, Your friends come with you, take their leaves of you, and then you ſee them ſtand upon the ſhore a while, but when you ſail a little further, your friends are out of ſight, and then you ſee only the ſhore; you ſail on a little further, and then you ſee only the houſes; you ſail a little further, and then you ſee only the ſteeples, and ſuch high places; and you ſail yet a little further, and then you ſee nothing but the Ocean: So it is in hearing the Word; It may be when you go home, there are ſome things freſh in your mind, but on the munday mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you have loſt ſome; but then there are ſome others that do yet preſent themſelves before you, and then you loſe more and more, untill you have loſt the ſight of all; all truths are gone, you ſee no more of the Word, as if you had never heard it; this is not to ſanctifie Gods Name; you ſhould treaſure up the Word as the moſt rich Treaſure that may be.</p>
            <p>Another ſort to be rebuked are thoſe, who are ſo far from falling down before the Lord to receive the Word with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as they can bleſs themſelves in their wicked waies, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Word comes and meets with them. I only name this, becauſe of that notable Scripture we have, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 18, 19. ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> there to them, <hi>Take heed, leſt there ſhould be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood,</hi> (what's that root that beareth gall and wormwood?) <hi>And it come to paſs when he heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſs himſelf in his heart, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, &amp;c.</hi> Take heed there be not among you, a root that beareth gall and wormwood; This is a bitter root in mens hearts, when they can hear the Word of God, and have their hearts riſe againſt it, and think with themſelves that there is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, theſe are but meer words, but meer wind; let the Miniſter ſay what he will, and talk as long as he will, I will go on in my way, I ſhall do well enough; that which he ſaith, it is but his opinion. I ſay, when men can bleſs themſelves thus in their
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:104284:86"/>
way, and when there are ſuch tumulcuous and rebellious thoughts riſing in their hearts, this is a root of gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; and take heed of it, it will bring forth bitter fruit one day. But I ſhould quickly be prevented if I ſhould lanch into this argument, to reprove the ſeveral waies of ſinning againſt God in hearing of his word. And therefore I leave thoſe, and come to ſhew what a fearful thing it is for men and women not to ſanctifie the Name of God in the hearing of his word, that ſo you may ſee that God will have his Name ſanctified up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. And they are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, You that do not ſanctifie Gods Name in hearing his word in thoſe waies that have been opened to you, Firſt, you loſe the greateſt and happieſt opportunity of good that ever creatures had, for an outward opportunity: indeed when God moves by his Spirit if that be neglected, that opportunity is more than meerly hearing his Word, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe except it be at ſuch a time when God adds his Spirit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Word; I ſay, you that are caſt by the providence of God in ſuch a place where the word of the Goſpel is preached to you, applied and urged upon you, if you ſanctifie not the Name of God, to hear as you ought, and to profit by it; I ſay, you loſe the greateſt opportunity for good that is in the world: Oh what haſt thou loſt that haſt lived many yeers under the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and yet haſt not been acquainted with this myſtery of godlineſs in ſanctifying Gods Name in the word. There are many thouſand ſouls that are, and ſhall be bleſſing God to all eternity for what of God they have met withal in the Word, but thou haſt ſat under it ſtuped as a block, dead and barren, and no good hath been done; <hi>Wherefore is there a prize in the hand of a fool, and he hath no heart to get wiſdom?</hi> This will lie upon thee heavy one day, the loſs of ſuch an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and that is the firſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place, Know that this Word that is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God for the conveyance of ſo much mercy to his Elect, it will prove to be the greateſt aggravation of thy ſin that can be; <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light:</hi> This is <hi>[The]</hi> condemnation. If ſo be that light had not come among you, then the condemnation
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104284:86"/>
had not been ſo great, your ſin had not been ſo great, and your puniſhment had not bin ſo great. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14, 15. where ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of thoſe that did enjoy the Word, and yet did not ſanctifie Gods Name in it. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not receive you</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples) <hi>nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that houſe, or City, ſhake off the duſt of your feet: Verily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for the Land of Sodom and Gomorah in the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than for that City.</hi> It is a moſt dreadful Scripture; their very duſt muſt be ſhaken off in token of indignation, and it ſhal be more eaſie for the Land of Sodom and Gomorah in the day of judgment than for that place. You would be very loth to be in a worſe condition than Sodom and Gomorah that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by fire from heaven, <hi>And now ſuffer the venegance of eternal fire, Jude</hi> 7. Certainly they ſhall not be ſo deep in judgments, as thoſe that live under the Miniſtry of the Word, and ſanctifie not the Name of God in it. Your ſin is of a deeper dye, than the ſin of the Heathens; yea, and in ſome reſpects than the ſin of the Devils, they never had the Word of the Goſpel ſent to be preached to them: and therefore this will aggravate your ſin, not only beyond Heathens, but beyond Devils. Look to it then that Gods Name be ſanctified in the hearing of his Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Know that ſo much as the Word is rejected, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is rejected; <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> It is Chriſt himſelf that is rejected when the Word is rejected: thou haſt not to do with man ſo much as with Jeſus Chriſt in the hearing of the Word, and the power of Jeſus Chriſt is to be put forth either to do thee good by the Word, or to avenge thy neglect of the Word: Therefore in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18 19. when Chriſt ſends forth his Diſciples to preach, he makes this preface, <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth: Go ye therefore and teach:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I have received all power in Heaven and Earth; through the power I received I ſend you to preach, <hi>and I'le be with you to the end of the world:</hi> that is, Al power in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth ſhal go along with you to aſſiſt your Miniſtry, either for the good of thoſe that ſhall embrace it, or for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of thoſe that ſhal reject it; ſo that whoſoever ſtands out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Miniſtry of the Word, ſtands out againſt all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> power
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:104284:87"/>
Heaven and Earth that is given to Chriſt: do not think that thou doeſt reſiſt a poor weak mortall man, but thou doeſt reſiſt all the power in Heaven and Earth. And is not this a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing then, to be guilty of not ſanctifying of Gods Name?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, it is an Argument of extream hardneſs of heart not to be wrought upon by the Word. <hi>Luk</hi> 16. 31, <hi>If they here not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the prophets, nether wil they be perſwaded though one roſe from the dead,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Abraham.</hi> Certainly that man or woman that ſhall not be wrought upon by the Word ſo as to ſanctifie Gods name in it, I ſay to ſuch, If one ſhould riſe from the dead they would not have there hearts wrought upon, and therefore much leſs are they like to be wrought upon by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. it may be ſome of you think when you are upon your ſick beds then you will repent; no ſurely, if this that is the great Ordinance to bring men to God ſhall not work upon you ſo as God ſhall be honored in it; you cannot expect that ſick neſs and affliction ſhould do it, no, if one ſhall come from the dead to tell you of all the miſeries that were there certainly if the Word work not upon you, that will not do it. But you wil ſay, One would think that there ſhould be more power to work upon the heart: truly no, becauſe it is ſuch an Ordinance appointed by God for working ſuch great works upon the hearts and conſciences of men, as the Word is: It is true, the Word is but a weak thing in it ſelf, but here lies the ſtrength that it is an Ordinance of God appointed for to work upon the hearts of men; therefore if this work not upon you to give God glory in the hearing of it; there is no other means like to do it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, when the Word works not upon men, it is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſign of reprobation, <hi>If our Goſpel be hid</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3) <hi>it is hid to thoſe that are loſt.</hi> It is a dreadful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that here is a loſt creature, one that God intends no good to. One the Lord works upon, perhaps he lets paſs another, one in a family and not in another. Now where it is ſo that the Word worketh not I ſay there is no ſuch dreadfull brand of Reprobation as this is. It is true, we cannot give any certain ſign of Reprobation; therefore I cannot ſay of any man, he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:104284:87"/>
hath now ſuch a mark upon him as doth evidently prove that he is a Reprobate; we cannot tell that, becauſe we know not what God may do afterwards, but we may ſay this, That it is as dreadful a ſign as any. There are not any more dreadful ſigns than theſe two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, For a man to be ſuffered to proſper in a ſinful courſe; For God to let men go on and have their hearts deſire ſatisfied in an ungodly way.</p>
            <p>And then ſecondly, For the Lord to leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo as the Miniſtry of the Word ſhal not work upon them, that they ſhall be by Gods providence ſo diſpoſed of, as to live under a faithful and powerful Miniſtry, and that it ſhould not work upon them: Theſe are the two blackeſt ſigns of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; and therefore it is a moſt dreadful thing to ſit under the Miniſtry of the Word, and not to ſanctifie Gods Name in it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the next place: Surely there can be nothing ſanctified to thee who doeſt not ſanctifie Gods Name in His Word. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>That every thing is ſanctified by the Word and Prayer.</hi> And how canſt thou exſpect that the Word ſhould ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie any thing unto thee, ſeeing that thou doeſt not make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſanctifying Gods Name in the Word? The godly think thus, 'Tis the Word that muſt ſanctifie all things to my ſoul, and I had need then ſanctifie Gods Name in that from which I exſpect the ſanctified uſe of all bleſſings. You therefore that can ſit under it, and make not concience of ſanctifying Gods Name in it, I ſay, you can expect no ſanctified uſe of any thing that you have in this world.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Such as do not ſanctifie Gods Name in the Word, are very nigh to a curſe: There is a notable Scripture for this in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7, 8. where the Apoſtle compares the Word to the rain that fals upon the ground, <hi>For the earth that drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, receiveth bleſſing from God: But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that which beareth thorns and bryars is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</hi> The meaning is this plainly, The rain here is the Word, &amp; the good hearers they are like the ground that receive the rain and bring forth fruit, and receive a bleſſing: But now ill hearers
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104284:88"/>
that do not ſanctifie Gods Name in his Word, they are like ground that receives the rain as much as the other, hear as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sermons as the other, but they bring forth nothing but thorns and bryars: and mark what a dreadful expreſſion is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; Firſt, <hi>It is rejected,</hi> Secondly, <hi>It is nigh to curſing.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Whoſe end is to be burned.</hi> Thou rejecteſt the Word, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou? The Lord rejecteth thy ſoul. If thou haſt no need of the Word the Word hath no need of thee; it is a dreadful thing to be rejected of God. And then, thou art <hi>uigh unto curſing:</hi> It may be the Lord may for the time withdraw Himſelf from the ſoul, and manifeſt that it is at it were rejected; but yet the ſoul hath not the curſe of God upon it, to ſay, Well let this ſoul periſh for ever: but ſome there are that are under an actual curſe, and ſaith God, Well, My Word ſhall never do good to this ſoul, ſuch a one hath ſate under it thus long, and hath rejected it, My Word ſhall never do good to him: Like as in <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. where thoſe that made excuſes when they were bidden to the Supper, the text ſaith at length, <hi>That the Maſter of the Feaſt was angry</hi> (which was God Himſelf that invited them by the Goſpel to partake of His Son; and when men would not come in but make excuſes, and refuſed the offer of the Goſpel,) <hi>Verily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>none of thoſe men, that were bidden ſhall taſt of my Supper.</hi> They ſhall never partake of any good of the Goſpel. This is a dreadful curſe. Now the Lord deliver you from having this curſe pronounced againſt you, but yet I beſeech you tremble at this Scripture in the <hi>Hebrews, they are nigh to curſing.</hi> Who knows how nigh ſome ſoul in this place may be to this curſe, for God to ſay, This ſoul hath been often invited, and yet hath made excuſes, and put off all, he ſhall never taſt of my Supper, of the good things in Jeſus Chriſt, the Word that hath been ſo rejected ſhall never do them good more; you had better never been born than to have this curſe actually upon you. Oh fear and tremble leſt your condition be ſuch as to be nigh to curſing: Who knows what a day, a week may bring forth? It may be the Lord may ſpare and be willing to paſs by the neglect of former Sermons; but who knows what the next actual rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the Lord in His Word may do to bring the curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee? And then if ſo, the next part of the verſe will prove
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104284:88"/>
to be thy portion, <hi>Whoſe end is to be burned.</hi> Oh! It is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to ſin againſt the Word: God ſtands much upon it.</p>
            <p n="8">8, Eightly, Know that if Gods Name be not ſanctiſied in it, the end that God hath appointed it for, will be turned quite contrary to thee; The proper end that God hath appointed his Word for, it is to ſave ſouls: but now, where Gods Name is not ſanctified it is turned quite contrary; ſo the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>To the one we are the ſavor of death unto death, and to the other the ſavor of life unto life:</hi> It is a dreadful thing that the good Word of God in which there is ſuch treaſures of Gods mercy, wherein the counſels of God, concerning mans eternal eſtate comes to be revealed, that this ſhould prove to be the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of death unto death unto any ſoul, that is, to have ſuch an efficacy in it, as to kill them by the very ſcent of it as it were; As ſome things have ſuch a poyſon in them, as the very ſcent is enough to poyſon one; So ſaith the Apoſtle, to ſome our word hath that efficacy being turned quite to the contrary end, ſome ſouls are ſav'd, and are, and ſhal be bleſſing God to al eternity for the Word; and thy ſoul is damn'd by the Word, ſo as thou wilt hereafter curſe the time that ever thou cameſt to hear it: That wil be a dreadful thing, that the ſame Word that others ſhal be bleſſing of God eternally in Heaven for, that thou ſhalt be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing eternally in Hell for, it will be turned to the quite contrary end; if it works not in the right way, it will work the other; the truth is, it hardens mens hearts if it brings them not to God; there is nothing that doth harden the hearts of men more than the Miniſtry of the Word: yet by accident, not by its ſelf, there is no men in the world have ſuch hard hearts as thoſe that are wicked under the Miniſtry of the Word; it is not only an argument that their hearts are hard, but they are har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by it: That in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 9, 10. is remarkable for this, and the rather becauſe I find it ſo often quoted by Chriſt, I think it is quoted three or four times in the Goſpel, <hi>And he ſaid Go and tell this People, hear ye indeed, but underſtand not, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:104284:89"/>
               <hi>and be healed.</hi> This is a ſtrange Scripture: What, muſt a Prophet go to them to make their hearts fat, and to ſhut their eyes? why, the word is appointed to open mens eyes, but here the Prophet is ſent to ſhut their eyes that they might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; this is dreadful, this is for the puniſhment of ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer neglect of the word of God ſent unto this people; above all Judgments you ſhould be afraid of this; It is not ſo much that a fire ſhould be upon your houſes, as that God ſhould make his word to be a means to harden your hearts. In <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. we have a dreadful expreſſion to this purpoſe, by the Prophet there, where the Lord ſaith, The people did come to enquire of him, with ſetting up their Idols in their hearts, but ſaith God, <hi>I will anſwer them according to their Idol.</hi> If men come to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the word with their beloved ſins, and reſolve that they will not part with them, the Lord many times in his juſt judgment ſuffers ſome things in the word to be accidentally a means to harden them in that ſin of theirs. <hi>I will anſwer them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Idol:</hi> Thoſe men are in a dreadful eſtate whoſe hearts come to be hardened by the word.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Ninthly, If thou doeſt not ſanctifie Gods Name in the hearing of the word, what comfort canſt thou ever have by the word in the day of affliction? Certainly when the day of thy affliction comes, then there is nothing can comfort thee but the word: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thy Law had been my delight</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I ſhould then have periſhed in mine affliction:</hi> But thou having been exerciſed in the word ſo much, and Gods Name not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, thou muſt not expect to have thy ſoul comforted in the day of thy affliction. No marvel then though the word hath been applied again and again to your hearts, and nothing would ſtick: I remember it was an expreſſion of one in a great deal of terror of conſcience; many came to apply comfortable Scriptures to him, and he himſelf for a while did take thoſe Scriptures and lay them upon his heart to paſſifie his troubled conſcience, but a little before he died, he cries out with a moſt fearful terror, <hi>There is a fair Plaiſter made but it will not ſtick on, it wil not ſtick on</hi> ſo died deſpairing: ſo there is in the word ſuch a plaiſter as may help a wounded and troubled conſcience, but canſt thou expect that haſt not ſanctified Gods Name in thy life
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104284:89"/>
time that it ſhall ſtick upon thy ſoul in the day of thy afflction? never expect it, for the Lord hath ſaid otherwiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe when I cryed and call'd ye would not hear, you ſhal cry and call and I will not hear;</hi> The Lord in His Word cries to the, Oh thou ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoul who are going on in the waies of ſin and eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, Return, return, that is the way that will bring thee to eternall miſeries, but here is the way that wil bring thee to life and eternall ſalvation: Thus the Lord cries and cals to day, to day, and thou ſtopeſt thy ear, Oh how juſt is it with God to ſtop his ear from thy crying and calling in the day of thy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffliction.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Further, Know that thou that doeſt not ſanctife the Name of God in his Word, that all the Word of God wil be made good one day upon thee, God hath His time <hi>to magnifie his Law and to make it honorable, Iſa.</hi> 42. 21. You ſlight Gods Law, you ſlight His Word, and deſpiſe it, but God will mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie it and make it honorable, there is not any ſentence that thou haſt heard in the Word, but it ſhall be made good, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever becomes of thy ſoul, Thou thinkeſt that God is a merciful God, &amp; he will not damn thee; but though God be merciful and hath regard to His Creatures, yet the Lord hath ten thouſand times more regard to His Word than to all the ſouls of men and woman in the world, and God will ſtand to make that good, he will not have ſuch regard to that wretched vile ſinfull ſoul of thine as not to honor His Word, He will honor His Word whatſoever becomes of thee, and al that thou haſt heard and rejected ſhall be made good upon the on day.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Again the Word that thou doeſt reject and ſin againſt, it ſhall be the Word that ſhall judg thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 48. Look to it as well as you will; This Book of God out of which we preach, and thoſe truths that we delivered to you from his Word, they muſt be called over again at the great day to judg your ſouls by the ſentence of every of your eternal eſtates muſt be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of this book: Oh look upon it as the word that muſt judg your ſouls at the laſt day, and then you will ſee it a dreadfull thing not to ſanctifie Gods Name in it. And then when the Word doth judg you you ſhall obey it whether you will of no. Now the Word convinces you and you will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:104284:90"/>
it; but when God comes to judg you by the Word, then you ſhall obey it: Then when God comes to reade that ſentence out of the Word, <hi>Go ye curſed into everlaſting fire:</hi> then I ſay, you ſhall be forced to obey it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Laſtly, There is yet one thing more (which ſhould have been mentioned before) which is very remarkable; That thoſe men which do not ſanctifie Gods Name in his Word, they will be blaſted, even here while they live, their parts and common gifts that they yet have will be blaſted, wither, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. We find it ordinarily, that many that are yong, had very good beginnings, and very good parts, that were very hopeful, and would ſpeak very ſavorly where they came; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards beginning by degrees to neglect the Word, the Lord hath blaſted them, their gifts have withered, the common gifts of the Spirit have been taken from them. I will give you one text for that in <hi>Luke,</hi> 8. 18. <hi>Take heed therefore how you hear.</hi> (It is an Exhortation that follows upon the parable of the Sower that went out to ſow) becauſe it is ſo that when the Word is ſowen as ſeed, there is ſo little of it doth proſper, and moſt hearers do not ſanctifie Gods Name in it, therefore look to your ſelves; Why? <hi>For whoſoever hath, to him ſhal be given; and whoſoever hath not, from him ſhal be taken even that which he ſeemeth to have.</hi> You had need look to your ſelves how you hear, for the truth is, all depends upon it under God; have you got any common gifts of the Spirit of God, or any abilities to do any ſervice for God? do not be proud of them, neither be jolly, nor think that you are able to do better than others, and that thoſe are but ordinary things that the Miniſter ſpeaks, and you are gotten into a higher form. Look to your ſelves, take heed you come not to the Word with a proud Spirit, be not offended at the plainneſs of the Word; take heed how you hear, for if you do not, that that you ſeem to have ſhall be taken from you, ſaith Chriſt: You ſeem to have excellent gifts, yea, you ſeem to have grace too, but take heed how you hear for all this, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever parts you have got, though you be highly eſteemed in the company where you come; and you are able to do things more than others, yet I ſay, Take heed how you hear, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe that that you have will be taken away from you: have
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:104284:90"/>
we not ſeen this in our own experience? and it is apparant that they began to be withered and to be blaſted by neglecting of the word. And therefore I beſeech you look to this, that you doe ſanctifie the name of God in His Word, and let your hearts bow unto it as unto the Ordinance of God, and wait upon it in the Miniſtry of it, leſt you wither and be blaſted and come to nothing.</p>
            <p>And thus I have ſhewen the great evil of not ſanctifying Gods Name, and how God will be ſanctified.</p>
            <p>I ſhall be very brief in the Uſe of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Oh that the Lord by this would cauſe ſomething to ſtick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hearts, that what hath been preached in this point may be made uſeful for many Sermons afterwards! that it might be ſaid of you in this place as it was ſaid of them in <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. <hi>When the Gentils heard this they were glad, and glorified the Word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternal life beleeved.</hi> Oh! that God would make every one of you to be a means to glorifie the Word of God! That ſhould be our care that the Word of God may be glorified by us; we come to hear the Word, but take heed that the Word of God be not diſhonored by us; In 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Finally brethren pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may have free courſe, and be glorified, even as it is with you:</hi> Oh that we were able to ſay ſo! and yet through Gods mercy in ſome degree we hope we can ſay ſo: and I could heartily pray that the Word of God might be glorified in all places as it hath been with many of you; but yet go on in this, and labor every one of you that it may be more glorified, that you may manifeſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Word in your Converſations, that all that do behold you may glorifie the Word, and ſay, Oh what hath the Lord wrought in ſuch a place, in ſuch families, families that were wretched, vile, carnal, and liv'd without God in the world, Prophane, Swearers, Foul-mouth'd, Unclean; Now ſince they have attended upon the Word, how hath it wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them! what a change is there in ſuch men and women! That the carnal husband may ſay, Since ſuch time as my wiſe hath attended upon the Word, I have ſeen a beauty in her conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſhe it more holy, more gentle, and meek; and ſo my
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:104284:91"/>
ſervant, more ſubmiſſive and faithfull, and ſo my children more obedient than before; Oh that the Word may be thus glorified. Take heed I beſeech you that the word be not blaſphemed by any of you: In <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 5. there the Apoſtle gives divers exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and among others to Wives, and to Servants, <hi>To be diſcreet; chaſt, keepers at home good, obedient to their owne huſbands, that the word of God be not blaſphemed;</hi> you muſt performe your duties unto your husbands and why? that ſo the Word of God be not blaſphemed, that is, that neither your husband, nor any of your friends may blaſpheme the Word and ſay. What do you get this by going to Sermons? Oh it ſhould pierce your hearts when as your conſcience tell you that you have given cauſe whereby the Word of God ſhould be blaſphemed: and ſo he exhorts ſervants and others, and all in the ſtrength of this argument, <hi>That the Word of God be not blaſphemed:</hi> you get up early in a morning to here the Word, that's good, but take heed you give no occaſion that the word be blaſphemed.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſhew what an excellent thing it is, ſo to ſanctifie Gods Name in the hearing of His Word as to honor it, and how God will ſanctifie His own Name in mercie to you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, All the good in the word is thine if thou doſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie Gods Name. There is abundance of good in this Word that we preach, it is the Word of the Goſpell, and to have all the good in that to be thine, that muſt needs be an excellent thing; you will ſay, ſmotimes I read and heare ſuch things in the Word that if I were but ſure that theſe things were my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how happy ſhould I be? Here's one ſigne by which thou maieſt be aſſured that they are all thy portion: Is it thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned care to ſanctifie Gods Name in the hearing of His Word? Oh peace be to thee! all the good in the Word in thine: And here we might fall into a commendation of the Word of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and if I ſhould give way to that a great deal of time would quickly be gone, I will only give you one Scripture for your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment to ſanctifie Gods Name in the hearing of his Word by way of commendation of it it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 5, (a place I am afraid you have not heard the ſweetnes of it for the want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it) It is quoted out of <hi>Deut. for</hi> Moſes <hi>deſcribeth the</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:104284:91"/>
               <hi>righteouſnes which is of the Law, that the man which doth thoſe things ſhal live by them. But the righteouſneſs which is of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe; Say not in thine heart, who ſhal aſcend into Heaven that is, To bring Chriſt down from above; or, who ſhal aſcend into the deep, that is, To bring Chriſt again from the dead? But what ſaith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart, that is, the word of faith which we preach.</hi> The text hath ſome difficulty, and yet exceeding ſweet to us to know it; I confeſs if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had not quoted this place out of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and thus interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, who could ever have thought in reading of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> that by one had been meant the word of the Law, and by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word of the Goſpel? Therefore the meaning is this, here is a compariſon between the Word of the Law and the Word of the Goſpel. Concerning the Word of the Law, there is two things wherein that comes ſhort of the Word of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is not ſo nigh thee,</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is not ſo certain to aſſure thy ſoul what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thee to all eternity: The Word of the Law ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> but the Word of the Goſpel <hi>is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart.</hi> You will ſay, Why is not the Word of the Law as nigh one as the Word of the Goſpel? I Anſwer, The Word of the Law, you hear it in your ears, but it is not written in the heart as the Word of the Goſpel is: The Law cannot work ſavingly upon the heart of a man to bring ſalvation: thoſe that are meerly Legal, they can hear the duties that are required, but the Word hath no power to write in their hearts what they do hear: But now when you come to hear the Word of the Goſpel, that is nigh you, even in your very hearts as wel as in your ears; God ſpeaks in it, and it comes into your hearts, and there it works efficaciouſly, which the Law cannot: The Law is but a dead Letter in compariſon of the Word of the Goſpel. If you come meerly to hear the Law preached, add not in an Evangelical way, you may hear it a hundred times, and it wil never be written in your hearts? but when you come to hear the Goſpel in an Evangelical way, that will come to be written in your hearts, ſo that the Word of the Goſpel is nigh you. But what is the meaning of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:104284:92"/>
               <hi>Say not, who ſhall aſcend up into Heaven &amp;c?</hi> The meaning is this, As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, The truth is, while you have no other but the righteouſneſs of the Law, you are at an infinite uncertainty about your eternal eſtates. The Law ſaith, <hi>Do and live;</hi> but you can never know when you have done enough ſo as to be certain that you are well for eternity: That ſaith, <hi>Who ſhal aſcend into Heaven</hi> to know the mind of God concerning me? whether he will accept of me, and of that obedience and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that I tender up to him? <hi>Who ſhall go down into the deep?</hi> Who ſhall go down to Hell to know there, whether that place be prepared for him or no? It is a phraſe that only expreſſeth an uncertainty that one cannot be ſatisfied about his eternal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, except he could go to Heaven, and there ſee and read Gods Book, and ſo diſcover Gods mind concerning him; or go down to Hell, and ſo know whether that place be appointed for him or not; except I can do one of theſe I cannot certainly tell, (meerly by the Law) whether I ſhall go to Heaven or Hell. As you that are Merchants and Dealers abroad, you are at a great deal of uncertainty what ſhall become of your eſtates. Indeed if I could ſend one over to the Indies to tell me now my Ship proſpered, then I could be at a certainty, then I ſhould hear whether I were a rich man yea, or no, but except I could do ſuch a thing I am at an uncertainty: Such is the expreſſion here, As if a poor ſoul ſhould ſay, I would fain be ſaved, and loth to periſh eternally: But all the while the ſoul remains under the Law, it remains in an uncertain condition; but now ſaith he, The Word of the Goſpel is nigh thee, even in thine heart, and that is the Word that we preach, that ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt beleeve in thine heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, This Word of the Goſpel that is come into thine heart doth aſſure thy ſoul of thy eternal eſtate, ſo that though thou canſt not go up to Heaven, nor go down to Hell, yet thou haſt that in thine heart, that doth as it were aſſure thee that thou ſhalt be eternally ſaved, as if thou wert able to go up to the higheſt Heavens and fetch News from thence. Oh now, the good Word of the Goſpel, how ſhould we prize it, and keep
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:104284:92"/>
it in our hearts? for that's in our hearts that will aſſure us of our ſalvation to all eternity, and of Gods eternal purpoſe to do thee good in Heaven. You would account it a great happineſs if there could be any art to ſend abroad to the Straits or to other place, to know how things fare with you: but now if thou haſt the Word of the Goſpel within thee, if that prevails in thy ſoul, thou haſt alwaies got ſomething in thy heart that will tell thee how things are with thee in Heaven, and what ſhall become of thee for all eternity. Oh who would not ſanctifie the Name of God in hearing of His Word, ſeeing it is ſuch a bleſſed Word wherein the Goſpel is opened with more clearneſs than it hath been to many of our fore-fathers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a certain evidence of your election, in <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 3. 4, 5. <hi>Remembring without ceaſing your work of Faith, and labor of Love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the ſight of God and our Father, Knowing Brethren, beloved your election of God;</hi> Why? <hi>For our Goſpel came not to you in Word only, but alſo in Power, and in the holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance.</hi> And know this excellency there is in Sanctifying Gods Name in hearing the word, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you mark it, that it is a more bleſſed thing, than if you did bear Jeſus Chriſt in your wombs; You that are women, would not you have accounted it a great happines if Chriſt had been born in your wombs? Now if thou comeſt to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word, and ſanctifieſt Gods Name in it, thou art in a better condition, and haſt a greater bleſſing upon thee, than if thou hadeſt born Jeſus Chriſt in thy womb. In <hi>Luk</hi> 11. 27, 28. <hi>And it came to paſs as he ſpake theſe things, that a certain woman of the company lift up her voice and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is the womb that bear thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked.</hi> Seeing Chriſt and what gracious things came from him, ſhe ſpake ſo; <hi>But he ſaid, Yea, rather bleſſed are they that hear the Word of God and keep it.</hi> That is Labor to ſanctifie my Name, (as hath been opened in the particulars) rather is that woman bleſſed that doth ſo, than the woman that bear Chriſt: Me thinks this one Scripture ſhould be ſuch a Scripture for women, to cauſe them to ſanctifie Gods Name in hearing of the word, inſtead of a hundred Scriptures; certainly thou maieſt be ſo bleſſed, if thou wilt beleeve the word that comes from Chriſts mouth.</p>

3. Do you ſanctifie the Name of God in the Word, that will ſanctifie you, by that your ſouls come to be ſanctified, and it will comfort you in the day of your affliction, and it will ſave you at laſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4, You that do ſanctifie Gods Name in hearing of his Word, you will be the glory of the Miniſters of God at the great day of Judgment: You will be an honor to them before the Lord, and his Saints and Angels. In <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Holding forth</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>the Word of Life.</hi> This is the duty of all the hearers of the Word, that they muſt hold forth the Word of Life. When you go home, you muſt hold forth the power of the Word you hear: well, what wil become of that? <hi>That I may rejoyce in the day of Chriſt, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain:</hi> Let that be one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive amongſt the reſt. Saith the Apoſtle, This will be ſuch a glory to me, <hi>That I in the day if Ieſus Chriſt ſhall rejoyce, that I have not labored in vain,</hi> I ſhal bleſs God for all my ſtudies and care, and all the pains that ever I have taken, and venturing my ſelf for this people, I ſhall bleſs God in the day of Jeſus Chriſt. Would it not be a comfortable thing to you, that all the Miniſters of God that come to preach the Word ſaithfully to you, if at the day of Chriſt you ſhould hear them bleſſing God that ever he did ſend them to preach the Goſpel in ſuch a place, and you ſhould hear them ſaying, O Lord, it may be had I been ſent to another place I ſhould have ſpent all my ſtrength in vain, but through thy mercy I was ſent to a teachable people that were ready to imbrace thy Word, Oh! this is my crown and glory. Would it not do good to any whoſe hearts are faithful, to think this, That their holding froth the Word of Life will not only be a glory to God, which is the chief, but it will be a glory to the Miniſters, to recompence all their labors, that you ſhall not only be ſaved your ſelves in the day of Jeſus Chriſt, but you ſhall add to the glory of his faithful Miniſters likwiſe when they do appear before Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="5">5. I ſhall add one particular more, There is a time coming when God ſhall <hi>magnifie his</hi> word <hi>and make it honorable.</hi> What a joy ſhall it be to thee when the Lord before Men and Angels ſhall come to magnifie his Word, and make it honorable; for thee then to think, This is the Word that ſpoke to my heart at ſuch and ſuch a time this is that Word that I did reverence, that I did obey; that I did love, that I made to be the joy of my heart, this Word the Lord now doth magnifie and make to be honorable: This will be comfortable to thy ſoul.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE laſt day we finiſhed the Point fanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Name of God in the hearing of his Word; and now we will proceed to the ſanctification of the Name of God in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament; That's the next duty of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Now firſt for the word, <hi>Sacrament;</hi> I confeſs we have not that word in all the Scripture; as neither have we the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> and divers other words which Miniſters make uſe of to ſet forth the Myſteries of Religion by; but yet it is uſefull to conſider the meaning why Miniſters in the Church have given this name, unto thoſe ſings and ſeals that the Church receives: <hi>Sacrament,</hi> is to hallow a thing, or to dedicate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the Sacraments there are outward things that are made holy, for holy and ſpirituall ends.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We our ſelves do (as it where) hallow or dedicate our ſelves unto God in the vſe of theſe Ordinances: That one reaſon from whence it hath the name.</p>
            <p>Or otherwiſe, as ſome will have it, <hi>Sacramentum</hi> becauſe it is to be received <hi>ſacrament,</hi> with a holy mind, and therefore caled the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> The Churches have vſed it a long time; in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulliar's</hi> time (which was above fourteen hundred years ſince) he was the firſt that we find vſed this word, and moſt that
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:104284:94"/>
would open the word unto us, ſay, that eſpecially it was taken from the practice of Solders, who when they came &amp; liſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, bound themſelves in to a ſolemn Oath to be faithfull to their Captain, and to the cauſe that they did undertake; and the Oath they were wount to call <hi>Sacramentum,</hi> A <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Now in regard that Chriſtians when they come to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they come to ſeale a Covenant with God, and though they do not formally and explicitely take an Oath, yet they bind themſelves in a holy Covenant, which hath the ſtrength even of an Oath in it; (For a ſolemn Promiſe to the high God hath the ſtrength of an Oath in it) and from thence they were call'd by theſe names, <hi>Srcraments:</hi> but that for the Word, that you may underſtand it.</p>
            <p>But the word the Scripture uſeth to ſet out this Sacrament, by that that now I am ſpeaking of, is <hi>the communion of the body and blood of Chriſt;</hi> ſo you have it in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not Communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> I ſay we are now treating about this point, how we are to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Name of God, <hi>in that which the Scripture cals the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body and blood of Chriſt;</hi> And now for the opening of that</p>
            <p>Firſt, we muſt know that this is a part of the Worſhip of God, and we <hi>draw nigh to God</hi> in this, or otherwiſe it will not come up to our point.</p>
            <p>And then we ſhall ſhew that God is to be ſanctified in this duty of worſhip.</p>
            <p>And then thirdly, how.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We do in this draw nigh to God; We worſhip God; For when we are coming to receive theſe holy Signs and Seals, we come to preſent our ſelves before God; and we have to deale with God Himſelf in a ſervice that He Himſelf requires of us, in a Holy, in a Divine ſervice; we come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our ſelveſs to God for bleſſing, for communication of ſome higher good unto us than pobſſily thoſe Creatures that we have to deal with, are able of themſelves to convey to us, we come for a higher good than to taſt a pece of bread, or to drink a draught of wine, we come (I ſay) to preſent our ſelves to God; that we
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:104284:94"/>
might have Communion with him, and that we might have the bleſſing of the Covenant of grace conveyed unto us through theſe things; now certainly this is a drawing nigh to God, for to preſent our ſelves, for the conveyance of the bleſſing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace through theſe Creatures, yea, that we might have communion with God himſelf in them, this is drawing nigh to him, when we come to his Table; therefore we draw nigh to God; had not God inſtituted and appointed theſe Creatures, Bread and Wine, and the actions about them to be the means of conveyance of bleſſing unto us, it had been Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip for us to have expected any further preſence of God in ſuch creatures, than there is in the nature of them. It is true, God is preſent with every Creature, when we eat and drink at our Tables God is preſent there; but we cannot be ſaid to draw nigh to God, and worſhip God there; for we there look for no further preſence of God with us in them, to convey fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good than the Lord hath put into the nature of thoſe things; only when godly people take them, and receive them as bleſſings ſanctified by the Word, they take them as the bleſſings of God that come out of love to them. But now when we come to receive that which is cal'd <hi>the Communion,</hi> there we expect things that are beyond the nature of theſe creatures, to convey that that is by an inſtitution of God ſet apart for ſupernatural uſes and ends, not to convey in any natural way ſuch and ſuch things, but in a ſupernatural way, through the inſtitution of God, and ſo it comes to be worſhip. Had we not I ſay a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for this, it were ſuperſtition and Idolatry for us to make uſe of ſuch creatures for ſuch ends. If any man in the world ſhould have appointed a piece of Bread, or a draught of Wine, to have ſignified and ſealed the Body and blood of Chriſt, it had been Superſtition in any, and Wil-worſhip, and ſinful and abominable to you; but we are to look upon God, ſetting apart theſe Creatures for ſuch holy and ſolemn ends, and therefore when we come to be exerciſed in them, we come to worſhip God; and we come likewiſe to tender up our homage to God when we come to attend upon him in ſuch Ordinances as theſe are; to tender up that homage that is due from us poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, unto ſuch an infinite and glorious God: and therefore we draw nigh to him in theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:104284:95"/>
Secondly, We muſt ſantifie Gods Name in drawing nigh to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whatſoever we do <hi>whether we eat or drink we muſt do all to the glory of God:</hi> Now if your common eating and drinking we muſt do all to the glory of God, than certanly in this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eating and drinking there muſt be ſome ſpecial thing done for the glory of God in this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is ſo much of God in it; for here there is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting before us the great, yea, the greateſt Myſteries of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deep Councells of God concerning Eternal Life are preſented before us in theſe outward Elements of the Bread and Wine, and action thereof; Now when we come to eat and to drink thoſe things that are appointed to ſet forth the great Miſteries of Salvation, and the deepeſt of the Councells of God concerning mans Eternall good, wherein eſpecally God will gloryfie Himſelf; we had need there ſanctifie the Name of God, for the things that are very great and glorious that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Ordinance of the Lords Supper, or the communion it is an Ordinance that Chriſt hath left to his Church, out of the abundance of his love; and therefore you ſhall find if you read in the inſtitution of it, in the 25 of <hi>Matthew</hi> that the ſame night wherein Chriſt was betrayed, he took bread and brake it; though Chriſt was to die the next day, and to encounter with the warth of God, yea, that very night he was to be in an Agony and to ſweat drops of Water and Blood, and the next day to die and to have theſe tryals of wrath powered upon him, ſo as to put him to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> yet he buſies his thoughts that every night to inſtitute this Supper; ſurely this muſt be a great Ordinance, &amp; there is a great deal of love of Chriſt in it. Chriſt ſaw that his Church had need of it, that he ſhould that night when he was betrayed have his thoughts buſied about ſuch a thing as this is. One would think at that time, that he had enough to take up his thoughts concerning Himſelf being to encounter with the Law, and with the Wrath of God for mans ſin; but for all that great work Chriſt had to encounter with, yet his thoughts are buſied about this great Ordinance of the inſtitution of the Supper, and therfore there was great love in it, Chriſt ſaw
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:104284:95"/>
that it was a matter of great moment; Now if it be ſo, then there is great cauſe why we ſhould ſanctifie Gods Name in ſuch an Ordinance as this is, and not to account it as a common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt ſanctifie Gods name in this, becauſe it is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of of our communion with Chriſt, wherein we come to have ſuch a neer Union and Communion with him as to eat his Fleſh, and to drink his Blood, and to ſit at his Table. We come to have communion with Chriſt even in all our ſences; now Chriſt coming ſo fully to us, that cals upon us to ſanctifie his Name when we come before him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In this the Covenant of Grace is ſealed, the Covenant of Grace comes to be ſealed in both the parts of it; now when we come to have to deal with God in the way of the Covenant of Grace, both to have the Seal on his part, and the ſeal on ours, ſurely this muſt needs call for a ſanctified uſe of ſuch a thing as is ſo holy as this is. And that's the firſt reaſon why we are to ſanctifie Gods Name in this, becauſe if we be in ordinary eating and drinking we muſt do it, then in this, wherin there is ſo much of God, wherein the Myſteries of Godlineſs are ſet before us, wherein there is ſo much of the love of Chriſt, wherein we are to have cloſe Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, and wherein the Covenant of Grace comes to be ſealed on both ſides: there had need therefore be ſanctifying of Gods Name in the uſe of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider this, That there is no duty in al the book of God that I know of, that is urged with more ſtrength and ſeverity than this is; as in that place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. ſheweth, where you have required of every one that comes to receive the Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper, <hi>That they ſhould examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and ſo eat;</hi> and you have the moſt dreadful expreſſions againſt thoſe that do not do it, that I know are mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the neglect of any duty in all the book of God; there the holy Ghoſt faith, That <hi>whoſoever eats and drinks unworthily,</hi> Firſt, <hi>he is guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt;</hi> and then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>he eats and drink<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his own d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mnation:</hi> Theſe two expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have as much dreadfulneſs in them as can be imagined, and we do not find an exhortation to a duty backt with two ſuch ſevere expreſſions (in caſe we ſhould neglect our duty) as this
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:104284:96"/>
exhortation. What if we do not ſanctifie Gods Name in this dutie? we come to be <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</hi> Blood guiltineſs is a terrible thing; you know <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>Lord, deliver me from blood guiltineſs;</hi> to have but the Blood of an ordinary man to lie upon one, to ſhed the blood of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Rogue that lives in a murderous way, it would lie upon the conſcience and be very terrible; it is impoſſible that ſuch a man can be quiet all his daies, though he hath never ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red conſcience: An Heathen could not be at quiet if he hath the guilt of Blood lie upon him, but to be guilty of the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe blood is ten thouſand thouſand times more worth than the blood of all the men that ever lived upon the face of the earth muſt needs be a moſt dreadful thing; It is a fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>Guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt,</hi> that is, he offers ſuch an indignitie to the body and blood of Chriſt, as the Lord will charge him of being guiltie of it, guiltie of abuſing the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And then, <hi>he doth eat and drink his own damnation:</hi> but we ſhall ſpeak more to that, when we come to ſhew how God will ſanctifie his Name in thoſe that do not ſanctifie it here in this holy Ordinance. I will not therfore ſpend further time in thoſe Scriptures, for I bring them only now to ſhew that there is a neceſſity of it, that we do ſanctifie the Name of God in this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is nothing that ſtrikes more upon a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; we find it by experience, even upon wicked mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and eſpecially upon ſuch begin to be enlightned in the holineſs of this Ordinance, God hath put much honor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: I confeſs ſome men may uſe it ſuperſtitiouſly though it be an Ordinance of Chriſt, yet God hath put a great deal of honor upon this Ordinance, that men that are very wicked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, yet their conſciences tell them that when they come to this Ordinance then they muſt be good, then they muſt not ſin, but have good thoughts, and good prayers at that time. And many times they dare not come, if their conſciences tell them that they live in ſome ſin. I knew one my ſelf once that was to be executed, and he had never received this Ordinance in all his life, though about fourtie yeers of age; And being
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:104284:96"/>
askt the reaſon why, he confeſt that he lived in ſome ſin that he was loth to leave, and therefore would never come to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance all his life, though herein the Devil gul'd and deceived him; but I mention it to ſhew what a power there is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men about this Ordinance; this ordinarily is one of the firſt things that ſtrikes upon the ſouls of men, when they come to have their conſciences awakened, Oh how have I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned the Name of God in the Ordinance of the holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and have not ſanctified his name in it.</p>
            <p>That God ſhould be ſanctified in this Ordinance, that's cleer enough.</p>
            <p>But now the great work is, (which is the third thing which I promiſed to ſhew) how we ſhould ſanctifie Gods Name in this Ordinance, Certainly the Name of God hath been much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vain, there hath been a great deal of pollution in the uſe of this Ordinance, and in mens ſpirits when they have been exerciſing themſelves in ſuch an holy Ordinance as this is; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will open this to you, and ſhall not be very large in it, only to ſhew you the main and principall things that may ſerve for the direction of us, that the Name of God may not be taken in vain and diſhonored as heretofore, and I ſhall caſt what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpeak of into theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That whoſoever was to partake of this muſt be holy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; none can ſanctifie God, but he muſt have a ſanctified heart himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Ordinance it muſt be received in a holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; There muſt be a Communion of Saints for this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and it cannot be received any where elſe but in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The holy diſpoſition of ſoul particularly, or the qualifications of the ſoul that are required or the ſanictfying of Gods Name in this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The manner of the exiplcite going out of the ſoul, that there are to be at the very time of receiving.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The keeping of the inſtitution of Chriſt in our recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Theſe things are required for the ſanctifying of the Name of God in this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, Thoſe that come muſt be holy themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:104284:97"/>
This is an Ordinance not appointed for Converſion, to make holy; others that are not converted may come to the Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Word is appointed to work Converſion; 'tis appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to work Grace, to work the firſt Grace, <hi>Faith comes by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi> we do not find in all the Scripture that this is appointed for Converſion, but ſuppoſes Converſion; none are to come to receive this Sacrament but men and women that before are converted by the Word; the Word therefore is firſt to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en for their Converſion, and then this is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance appointed for to ſeal them: therefore in the Primitive times they let all come to hearing of the Word. and then when the Sermon was done, there was an Officer ſtept up and cried, <hi>Holy things for holy men,</hi> and then all others where to go out and therefore it was called <hi>Miſſa</hi> (though the papiſts did corrup it and ſo called it the <hi>Maſs</hi> afterwards, by mixing there own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions inſtead of the Supper of the Lord, but it had that name at firſt) I ſay, this holy Communion was called by the name of <hi>Miſſa,</hi> becauſe that all others were ſent away, and only ſuch as were of the Church, and accounted godly ſtaid: <hi>holy things to holy men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this muſt needs be ſo, becauſe that the nature of it being the Seal of the Covenant of Grace requires it; it muſt be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that al that comes hither muſt be in Covenant with God, they muſt be ſuch as have been brought to ſubmit to the Condition of the Covenant. Now the Condition of the Covenant of Grace is, <hi>Beleeve and be ſaved;</hi> it is therefore appointed for Beleevers; And as the nature of it begin a Seal, ſuppoſeth a Covenant, ſo none can have his covenant ſealed to them, but thoſe that do firſt ſubmit to it, and are brought into Covenant; When you make an Indenture, and put to the Seal, certainly the Seal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to thoſe that have their names in the Indenture. Now tis true, though mens names are not mentioned in the word, yet the condition is to thoſe that are brought in to beleeve in Jeſus Chrſt; ſaith God, I come now to ſeal all my mercies in Chriſt to their ſouls. We abuſe God if we come to take the ſeal to a blank, it is to make this Ordinance a rediculous thing; therefore there muſt be ſome tranſactions between God and your ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you come to the Seal; If a man ſhould ſay to you, Come, ſet
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:104284:97"/>
to your ſeal to ſuch a thing, and there were never any kind of tranſactions between this man and you before, you would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it rediculous, after there hath been agreements between you, you uſe then to ſeal. So it muſt be here, I would appeal to many of your conſciences that have come to the Lords Supper, what tranſactions have there been between God and your ſouls? Canſt thou ſay the Lord was pleaſed to reveal Himſelf to me, to make known to me my wretched condition, and the way of grace and ſalvation, and ſhewed me that upon my coming in to receive His Son, he would be merciful to me and pardon my ſins, and I have found the Spirit of God working my heart to Jeſus Chriſt the Lord from Heaven ſpeaking to me, and I ſending an Anſwer to Heaven again, how willing my ſoul was to accept of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which the Lord hath made with poor creatures in the word of His Goſpel; canſt thou ſay this in the uprightneſs of thy heart; if not, know that this Seal belongs not to thee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Lord hath by His word ſubdued thy heart to this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment firſt with him.</p>
            <p>Secondly This Ordinance, it is the Ordinance of ſpiritual nouriſhment, of eating the fleſh of Chriſt and drinking blood in a ſpiritual way. Now it muſt needs ſuppoſe that firſt there muſt be life before there can be any nouriſhment received in If it be appointed to nouriſh and encreaſe grace, then ſurely there muſt be grace before; what nouriſhment can a dead child take? The very firſt thing that is to be done is nouriſhment here, The word hath power to convey life &amp; then to nouriſh, but we reade of no ſuch thing here, but that which is to be done here is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to feed, to eat, and to drink, that is the end of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; therfore it muſt be ſuppoſed that thou muſt have Spiritual life, there muſt come no dead ſoul to this Ordinance, but thoſe who are quickned by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, they muſt come for nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the act here required doth note, That only thoſe that are holy and godly can receive this Sacrament; we are required by the Apoſtle <hi>examine our ſelves.</hi> To examine our ſelves of what? It muſt be of our godlineſs, examine what work of God hath been upon the ſoul, how God hath brought the ſoul to Himſelf, and what Graces of the Spirit of God are
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:104284:98"/>
there, And how we have been brought into Covenant with God Now if only thoſe can receive worthily, and are to come that firſt examine themſelves, then certainly ſuch only as are godly are to come, for they only can perform thoſe acts that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is a Sacrament of Communion with God, and Communion with the Saints; <hi>now what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs? what fellowſhip hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> If it be a Sacrament of Communion, of coming to the Table of God; Will God have enemies to come to his Table: you will invite no enemies to your Tables, but your children and friends; ſo they muſt be the Children of God, and the Friends of God, thoſe that are reconciled to God in the blood of his Son, and thoſe that are his Children that muſt ſit at his Table, therfore they muſt be holy. Now this may ſuffice for that firſt thing, that this is not an Ordinance for al ſorts of people, but ſuch as have ſubmitted to the condition of the Covenant before. Such as have grace and ability to examin themſelves of their graces, and ſuch as are children and reconciled to God, and ſo are fit to ſit at the Table of God, and to enjoy Communion with him and with his Son, and with the Saints; for we are one body ſacramentally when we come to this holy Ordinance; all others therfore certainly are to be kept from this Sacrament but ſuch.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Second thing wil make it out more fully, and that is, It is not enough that we be holy our ſelves; (and ſo al ignorant prophane and ſcandalous, yea al that are meerly civil, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make out any work of godlineſs upon their hearts, in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to Chriſt are excluded.)</p>
            <p>But, 1 It is to be done in a holy communion, and is cleer one of that place in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, it is not the Communion of the blood of Chriſt? the bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> And then ſaith the Apoſtle in the 17. verſe, <hi>for we being many, are one bread and one body:</hi> therefore all that come to receive the Sacrament, thay muſt ſo come, as they muſt be one body, one ſpiritual Corporation: this very conſideration, That thoſe with whom we receive the Sacrament are one body with us, it hath a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:104284:98"/>
great deal in it, for the helping of us to ſanctifie Gods Name; this Ordinance, I ſay, it is to be received only in a holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; one Chriſtian ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not receive the Sacrament alone, there muſt be a Communion whereſoever it is to be adminiſtred; it is not enough there is one godly man there, but there muſt be a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, and in that Communion it is to be received.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> You wil ſay, Muſt it be received in a Communion of Saints? what if wicked men do come there, will that hinder us from ſanctifying Gods Name in partaking of the Sacrament with them? Do not we find in Scripture that the Church had alwaies wicked men among them? there are alwaies tares gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing up with the wheat: If you reade even in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> you ſhall find that there were ſome in that Church that were wicked, yea, and it's thought that <hi>Iudas</hi> himſelf did receive the Sacrament; therefore what if wicked men be there, doth that hinder?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Firſt it is true, That in the Church of God there have been wicked men, and 'tis like there will be wicked men to the end of the world; but yet whereſoever there is a right Communion of Saints, there ought to be the power of Chriſt exerciſed to caſt out thoſe wicked men, or at leaſt to withdraw from them. This is the Law of Chriſt, That if there be any that have Communion with you, if any of them do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be wicked, you are bound in conſcience <hi>to go and tell them;</hi> if they do not reform, you are bound <hi>to take two or three;</hi> and if they do not yet reform, then you are bound <hi>to tell the Church,</hi> to tell the Aſſembly of the Saints when they meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſo the word <hi>Church</hi> doth ſignifie; and we find in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. chap. that when there was an inceſtuous perſon to be caſt out, it was done in the preſence of the Congregation: Thus far you are bound to do, otherwiſe you cannot ſay, that it is nothing to you if wicked men be there, for you have not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged your conſcience. and ſo you come to be defiled, and you do not ſanctifie Gods Name in this Ordinance, becauſe you have not done to the utternoſt of your duty for the caſting out of thoſe wicked men.</p>
            <p>And mark, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. there the Apoſtle writing to the Church, bids them that they ſhould <hi>purge out the old leaven, Know</hi>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:104284:99"/>
               <hi>ye nst (ſaith he) that a little leaven leaveneth the whol lump;</hi> the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak there of ſin, but of the wicked inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, ſaith he, you muſt look to it that this man be purged out from you, or otherwiſe you are all leavened by it, that is, the whol Church would be leavened by it, if there were not care taken to purge out that one man.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, ſhall we be the worſe for one wicked mans co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; No, if we be no way faulty in it, then we cannot be ſaid to be worſe and it cannot leaven us; but now when it is our duty to purge him out, and we do not do it; as in all communion of Saints there is a duty, and there is not any one but may do ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards it; thus far every communicant in every commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints muſt go; if there be a wicked man there, if you come to know it, and do not go thus far as I have ſpoken, you are defiled by him, you are not defiled by the meer preſence of wicked men; (for that is a meer deceit and gull that ſome would put upon men that differ from them otherwiſe;) but thus now you are defiled by their preſence, if you do not do your duty, and the uttermoſt that you are able to purge them out; yea, then the whol Congregation is defiled, if they do not do their duty; now this is the duty of every one in the Congregation, to tell their brother, or to take two or three, and after that to tel the Church, and ſo come to profeſs againſt them or if the Church will not do their duty as they ought, yet then to free their own ſouls, as to profeſs, here is one that is ſo and ſo guilty, and may be proved thus and thus: and ſo for my part I to free my own ſoul profeſs that this man or woman ought not to have communion here; and thus you come to free your own ſouls, and when you have done thus, though wicked men be there you may there eat and drink and not be defiled by their preſence, for you cannot be ſaid properly to eat with them now, not to have communion with them, no more than if a dog ſhould come and skip upon the Table, and take a piece of bread; you cannot have communion with him becauſe he takes it, no more have you with thoſe wicked men when once you have dealt ſo fare with them you for your ſelves profeſs againſt them that you for your own particular cannot have communion with them herein, this is not to eat with them: The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. latter end, he
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:104284:99"/>
doth there require, in the 11. v. that <hi>If any man that is called a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a fornicator, or covetous or an idolater, or a railor, or a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch an one no not to eat; for what have I to do to judg them alſo that are without?</hi> that is, the Heathens and thoſe that are in no communion with them, I have nothing to do to judg them; <hi>but do not ye judg them that are within?</hi> When we have ſo far freed out ſelvs as profeſſing againſt their ſin, then we cannot be ſaid to have communion with them, and then we do withdraw <hi>from thoſe that walk diſorderly,</hi> when we do our duty thus far. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>If any man obey not our Word by this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;</hi> and in the ſixt verſe of that Chapter he commands them in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that they ſhould withdraw themſelves from every brother that walked diſorderly.</hi> So that till we do our duty we come to be defiled; but now, if we do our duty, then it is not the mixture of a Congregation that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hinder any from receiving the Sacrament there, and this will tend much to ſatisfie men about the receiving in mixt Congregations where any are caſt into them, and are actual Members there</p>
            <p>But now on the other ſide, if we be in a place where either this Congregation will not take upon them any ſuch power to caſt out unworthy ones, or are not convinc'd of this power, then there is no rule that Chriſt hath ſet, that we muſt he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced al our dayes to continue to be in ſuch a Congregation as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies one of the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt; if ſo be there be any ſuch that are wicked, and we doe firſt what we can to have them caſt out, and we wait with patience in ſuch a Congregation for to have them caſt out, and yet we ſee that either the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not underſtand that they have any ſuch power, or deny ſuch a power that they have, and ſo upon that all people are left in a mixt way, I ſay then there is no rule in all the Book of God that ſhould force men to continue to be Members of ſuch a Communion where they cannot enjoy one Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, which is the Ordinance of <hi>Separating the precious from the vile,</hi> the Ordinance of caſting out the wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. It where a very diſeaſed body, and in danger quickly of the loſs of life, to take in every thing into it, and to have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expulſive
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:104284:100"/>
faculty to purge any thing out again; ſo a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is altogether without ſuch an Ordinance as that is of expelling ſuch as are wicked and ungodly; I ſay, I find no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that doth force people, and require them as bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to continue there where they may not injoy all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Jeſus Chriſt, and the right underſtanding of what I ſaw now, will help us to anſwer all thoſe Scriptures that are brought. As if it be that of <hi>Judas,</hi> firſt it is hard to make it out cleer whether it were the Lords Sudper that he received yea, or no: but ſuppoſe it be granted that he did, yet I make no queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but ſuch as <hi>Judas</hi> was, that ſhall continue to make ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>outward profeſſion as he did, and could not be diſcovered in the Church-way, but that we may receive with ſuch as are cloſe hypocrites.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, Jeſus Chriſt knew him to be faulty, and he told <hi>John</hi> that lay in his boſom what he was; but though he knew him as he was God, yet he deales with him in his miniſterial way, and he had appointed before that none were to be caſt out but were to be delt withal in ſuch a Miniſterial way; ſo that it is not enough though I knew by Revelation from God that ſuch a man were an Hypocrite; ſuppoſe God ſhould reveale from heaven to me that ſuch a man were an hypocrite, I think I might communicate with him ſtill when he doth not ſo far diſcover himſelf that I can by witneſs prove his evil; therefore though men be wicked, yet it doth not defile the communion where they are, if there hath been that way uſed that Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the obſervation in His Church. And when that is done, then I am to withdraw from him, and to profeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt communion with him, ſo that thats enough to anſwer the caſe.</p>
            <p>We reade likewiſe that there were divers wicked men among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and of Tares that grew in the Wheat.</p>
            <p>It's true, There where wicked men among them, but they were enjoyned by the Apoſtle to caſt out thoſe wicked men, and if they did not do it, it was there ſin, and they were defiled by it.</p>
            <p>And for Tares that were among the Wheat, take it that this is meant concerning the Church, ſuppoſe it where (and yet Chriſt ſaith plainly that <hi>the field is the world,</hi> and it's the godly and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:104284:100"/>
the wicked living together in the world, and ſo I find many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters take it but howſoever take it that it is meant of the Church-communion, yet thus far is cleer that it was through the fault of the Officers that there ſhould be any Tares among the Wheat; for ſo the text ſaith plainly, that while the ſervants ſlept there did Tares ſpring up; therefore there ſhould have been none.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They were not ſuch Tares as would ſpoil the Wheat, but as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith in thoſe Countries the Tares did grow much like Wheat all the while it was in the blade, ſo that they were hardly to be diſtinguiſhed, though ſome that were of more underſtanding were able to diſcern them from the Wheat; therefore though ſuch as do grow up like unto the Wheat may be ſuffered, and yet in this caſe only, that is, in caſe that it will prejudice the Wheat, that is, when they are ſo cloſe to the Wheat as there will be danger by plucking them up to pluck up the Wheat too, then they muſt be let alone: Mark, firſt it was through the negligence of the Officers; they ſhould have been kept out. Secondly, if they do get in, yet while they grow ſo cloſe to the Wheat as there will be danger that when you pluck out them, to pluck out the Wheat too, only in that caſe it muſt be forborn; but this gives no libertie that therefore all ſorts may be let into the Church, and there ſhould be no kind of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to caſt out thoſe that are venemous weeds that will do hurt and miſchief.</p>
            <p>But if you underſtand it (as many do) concerning the world, then the meaning is thus, The preaching of the Goſpel that comes to a place, and there's only good Seed ſown, and is a means of the converſion of many, but together with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſome; there are others that do hear the Goſpel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and the truth is they being mingled among the hearers of the Word inſtead of bringing forth good fruit according to the Goſpel, they bring forth the Tares; now ſaith the ſervant, Lord, how comes it to paſs that we preach ſuch excellent Truths in this place, and yet there are ſo many wicked men that bring forth ſuch wicked fruit? Lord, is it thy mind that we ſhould be wholly ſeparated from them, and have nothing to do with them, that there ſhould be a full ſeparation while we live in this
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:104284:101"/>
world? no ſaith Chriſt, not ſo; for then the truth is, if all godly men ſhould wholly withdraw from wicked men, and beleeve that they may not live among them, they could not live in the world. If you did beleeve it were your dutie not ſo much as to live neer a wicked man, nor to have any thing to do in any kind of converſe with him, there would be no Wheat growing in this field of the world here; and therefore you muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, when you live where the preaching of the Goſpel is, and the ſeed brings forth good fruit in ſome, and in others it brings forth Tares, you muſt not be offended by this that here in this world God doth not by ſome viſible ſtroke of judgment come and ſtrike them dead, or that God doth not take ſome courſe that there ſhould be a full ſeparation here, but that they might live together til the day of judgment; here I ſay you ſhall not have ſuch a full ſeparation; ſo that you ſee it carries a very fair ſenſe to take the field to be the world, and the Kingdom of Heaven there to be the preaching of the Goſpel in any place, and ſo we muſt be content while we live in this world to be where wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ungodly men are. But it doth not follow from this place that we are to have converſe in the cloſeſt communion, in Church-communion with wicked men, to be made body by eating the ſame Bread, and drinking the ſame Wine; it holds not forth ſuch cloſe communion as this is; ſo that there's little ſtrength can be taken from that place, but ſtill it holds that whereſoever there is the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, there muſt be a holy communion of Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The Scripture only ſaith, Let us examine our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant, for the benefit of mine own ſoul, I muſt look to examine my ſelf more eſpecially; but now for another I am but only ſo far bound to look to him as to keep my ſelf clean; it is true, I am not bound to go and pry into his life and all his waies, ſo as to force him to give an account of things that are ſecret, but I am bound to keep a watch, and if any thing be done that offends me, then I am bound to go to him according to the formet Rule of Chriſt, and if he appears to be wicked, then I am bound to ſee him purged from the Congregition; for take but that other text in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Know you not that a</hi>

               <hi>little leaven leaveneth the whol lump?</hi> If I do not do ſo much as concerns my duty, than I am defiled by it. So as that you muſt not think that it is nothing to you how many wicked men comes to the Lords Table, and that it belongs only to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and they are to look to it; the truth is, that every one in his place is to look to it, and every one may be defiled, if he doth not perform this duty that God requires of him; do not ſay, What have I to do with my Brother; <hi>am I my Brothers keeper?</hi> It was the ſpeech of <hi>Cain</hi> if thou beeſt of the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, you are to have a care of your Brother; <hi>do not ye Judg thoſe that are within?</hi> there is ſome kind of judgment that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one may paſs upon ſuch as do joyn with them in the ſame Body; ſurely it concerns me much; what ſhall I do in ſuch an action as to joyn with them to eat Bread, whereby I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I do beleeve my ſelf to be of the ſame body, that this Drunkerd is of, that this Whoremaſter is of, that this Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is of? whenever you receive the Communion with any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, you do profeſs your ſelves to be of the ſame body with that Company; only in this caſe, If I have diſcovered any, and can particularly profeſs againſt any one, then I do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf to be of the ſame body with him; but now when I come in an ordinary way, and I know ſuch to be wicked, vile, and prophane, and I profeſſe nothing againſt them, nor take any courſe at all, I do then by partaking with them, profeſs my ſelf to be of the ſame body that they are of. Thou doeſt as it were openly declare, Lord, here we come and profeſs that we are all of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; now when thou knoweſt ſuch and ſuch are notoriouſly wicked and prophane, and doſt nothing in the world to help to purge them out, doſt not thou think that Gods name is taken in vain? is not Gods Name pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned here? therefore it co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of this holy myſtery of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, there are divers things further about this, and the ſpeciall thing I thought of, was to ſhew you the holy qualifications that there ought to be; but this I conceive to be the neceſſary, and I ſhould not have had peace in mine own conſcience as being faithfull to you in what I am ſpeaking, of ſanctifyng the Name of God in this Ordinance, if I ſhould not have mentioned this that I have ſpoken unto you, and ther's an error on both ſides, that I deſire to meet withal; either thoſe that come hand over head, and think it concerns them not at all with whom they come to the Sacrament but to look to their own hearts: and there's an error on the other ſide, that if they do what they can to keep them away, and yet if they ſhould be ſuffered to come, they may not come to partake of thoſe things, now it is very uſefull for us to know what we ſhould do in this caſe.</p>

So if a Church will give me ſome one Ordinance and not another, I confeſs ſo long as there is hope that I may enjoy it, and that they are in a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:104284:102"/>
way for injoyment, I think there ſhould be a great forbearance to a Church as wel as to a particular perſon; as I muſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from a particular man, where there is hope ſtill of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that there may come good of my forbearance, ſo towards a Church much more; but I ſay, if I cannot enjoy nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth there appear any hope of injoyment of all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, certainly it were but a cruelty to force men to ſtay there, when as otherwhere they may enjoy all Ordinances for the good of there ſouls. And this cannot be ſchiſm thus to do; As now if this ſchiſm? Supoſe a man were in a place and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſuch a Communion, for his outward benefit he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his dwelling from one place to another if he can have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trading in another place; than certainly if he may have more Ordinance for the edification of his ſoul; he may as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from one to another, as he may remove if his trading be better in one place than another. Chriſt would have all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple look to the edification of there ſouls; and ſhould I account that ſchiſm, when a man or woman meerly out of tenderneſs and a deſire to injoy Jeſus Chriſt in all his Ordinances for the benefit of there ſouls,, they find ſuch want to there ſouls of all Ordinances, that though they may have ſome in one place, yet if they cannot have all, their ſouls do not ſo thrive; now if this be all the end why they remove, that they might have more edification to their ſouls, injoying the Ordinances of Chriſt more fully, God forbid that this ſhould ever be acoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a ſin, that the Scripture is to brand; no that's ſchiſm when there is a violent rending out of malice, for the want of love; for as a poſtaſie is a rending from the head, ſo ſchiſm from the body, that is, when it is out of an evil ſpirit, from envie, or from malice, from want of love, or from any baſe ſiniſter ends, and upon no Juſt Ground; but now when it is meerly out of love to Jeſus Chriſt, that I might have more edification to my ſoul and ſtill I retaine love to the Saints that are there as they are in Communion, and ſo far as they have any thing good among them, I hold communion with them in that: only I deſire in humility, and in meekneſs that I may be in ſuch a place where my ſoul may be moſt edified, where I may enjoy al thoſe Ordinances that Chriſt hath appointed for his Church,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:104284:103"/>
certainly, that ſoul that can give this account to Jeſus Chriſt for going from one place to another, will be freed by Jeſus Chriſt from ſuch a ſin as this is that the world calls Schiſm; but the truth is, this word is in mens mouths that underſtand not what it means, and the Devil alwayes will have ſome word or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſt upon them that are good; for he hath heretofore gained much by it, ſo ſtill he makes account to gain much by words and terms and therefore men ſhould take heed of words and termes that they do not underſtand, and examine ſeriouſly what the meaning is and what is held forth in theſe words: And thus much for that point that it muſt be in a holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion wherever there is the receiving of the Lords Supper, it muſt be received in an holy Communion.</p>
            <p>Now we are to proceed to that which is the main thing, and that is, <hi>What are the holy Qualifications or diſpoſitions of the ſoul, together with the actings fit in receiving of the Lords Supper, what is required in the ſoul, for he ſanctifying of the Name of God in this holy ſacrament?</hi>

            <p>Yea, I am now going to ſet the Seal of the Covenant on my part, to renew my Covenant with thee, I am going to have Communion with thy Saints, to have the bond of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all thy people to be confirmed to me, that there might be a ſtrong bond of union and love between me and thy Saints than ever; theſe are the ends that I go for, this is the work that I am now going about; thus you muſt come in underſtanding, you muſt come with underſtanding, you muſt know what you are going about; this is that which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, when he ſpake of the diſarming the Lords body; he rebukes the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians for there ſin, and ſhew them that they were guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, becauſe they did not deſcren the Lords Body, they look'd only upon the outward elements, but did not diſcren what their was of Chriſt there, they did not underſtand the Inſtitution of Chriſt; they did not ſee how Chriſt was under thoſe elements, both repreſented, and exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them: that is the firſt thing, there muſt be knowledg and underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And now for the knowledg and underſtanding of the nature of the Sacrament; there need be knowledg in other Points of Religion, for we can never come to underſtand the nature of this Sacrament, without knowing God, and knowing our ſelves, knowing in what eſtate we are by Nature, knowing our Fall knowing the way of Redemtion, knowing Jeſus Chriſt what He was, and what He hath done for the making of an Atonement, the neceſſity of Jeſus Chriſt, and what the way of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is that God hath appointed to bring mens ſouls to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life by. The main points of Religion muſt be known, but
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:104284:104"/>
eſpecially that which concerns the nature of a Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Now this knowledg likewiſe muſt be actual, not meerly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual knowledg, but there muſt be a ſtirring up of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that is, by meditation, I muſt be meditating, have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thoughts and meditations of what I do know; that ought to be the work of a Chriſtian in coming to receive the Sacrament, to quicken up his knowledg, to have a renewed work of his knowledg by actual thoughts and meditations of the main Points of Religion, and eſpecially of the nature and the end of this holy inſtitution; that is the firſt thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As we muſt come underſtandingly, without which we cannot Sanctifie Gods Name ſo we muſt come with hearts ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the work that we are about, that is, becauſe the great thing that is here, is the breaking of Chriſts body, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth His blood. A ſutable diſpoſition to this is brokenneſs of heart, ſence of our ſin, of that dreadful breach that ſin hath made between God and the ſoul; our ſin ſhould be upon our hearts ſo as to break them; But this brokenneſs muſt be Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical; it muſt be through the applying of the Blood of Chriſt unto my ſoul; I muſt come to be ſenſible of my ſin; but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be ſenſible of it by what I ſee in the holy Sacrament, that muſt make me ſenſible of my ſin: There are a great many things to make me ſenſible of my ſin: The conſideration of the great God that thou haſt ſinned againſt, and the Curſe of the Law that's due to thee, the wrath of God that is incenſed againſt thee for thy ſin, and thoſe eternal flames that are prepared for ſinners, thoſe everlaſting burnings.</p>
            <p>But now thoſe are not the things that will break the heart in an Evangelical way, in a gracious way; the main thing by which the ſoul muſt come to break its heart, muſt be the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the evil of ſin in the red glaſs of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the beholding him broken; and truly there is nothing in the world, that hath that power to break the heart of ſin, as the beholding of that which is to be beheld in the holy Sacrament, and that heart is a hard heart that can ſee what is there to be ſeen, &amp; not break in the apprehenſion of ſin; when I here ſee what my ſin coſt, what a price was made for my ſoul, when I ſee the hatred of God againſt ſin, and the juſtice of God in not
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:104284:104"/>
ſparing his Son, but in breaking his Son for my ſin and in ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the blood of his Son for my ſins, I ſee here that the making of my peace with God did coſt more than ten thouſand worlds is worth; I ſee that by my ſin ſuch a breach was made between God and my ſoul, that all the Angels in Heaven, and Men in the World could never make up this breach; only the Son of God, he that was God and man, that was thus broken by the burden of the wrath of his Father for my ſins, could do this, The truth is, when we come to this holy Communion, we are to look upon Chriſt as if we ſaw Him hanging upon the Croſs, ſuppoſe thou hadſt lived at the time when Chriſt was crucified, and hadſt underſtood as much concerning the death of Chriſt as now thou doeſt, and what Chriſt was, if ſo be that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt have beheld Him in the Garden and there ſweating drops of water and blood, and lie groveling upon the ground, crying, If it be poſſible let this cup paſs from me: and ſhouldeſt have follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed Him to the Croſs, and there have ſeen His hands and feet nai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and His ſide pierced, and the blood trickling down, and have heard him crying out, My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me; would not ſuch a ſight as this is have broken thy heart for thy ſin? the truth is there is more, I won't ſay only ſo much, but I ſay there is more in this Sacrament to break the heart for ſin than ſuch a ſight as that.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, If you ſhould haue Chriſt to be crucified again before your eyes, if you ſhould ſee the body of Chriſt hanging upon the Croſs, and there behold him crucified, and hearing of him cry out, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me; you would think if your hearts did not break for ſin then, that they were deſperately hard; know every time that thou haſt come to receive the Sacrament, thou haſt come to ſee ſuch a ſight and it is as great an aggravation of the hardneſs of thy heart if it hath not broken at this ſight, as it would be if it ſhould not break at that ſight; We reade in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpeaking of the preaching of the Goſpel, he ſaith that Chriſt was crucified before thoſe that did hear the word: and fooliſh Galatians who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, crucified among you; he doth not mean that Chriſt was crucified in
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:104284:105"/>
               <hi>Galatia,</hi> but that where the word was preached he was evidently ſet forth, and crucified among them; but now my brethren, the crucifying of Chriſt in the Word, is not ſuch a real, evident and ſenſible ſetting forth of Chriſt crucified, as when he is ſet forth in this Sacrament, and tis that which works with more efficacie to break the heart than that other ſight; and the reaſon that I give is this:</p>
            <p>Becauſe you do never find that God did ſet that apart as an Ordinance: an inſtitution appointed to that end that they ſhould come to look upon that for the breaking of there hearts; there was indeed a naturalneſs in it; that if they did behold Chriſt, it might break there hearts, but it was not ſuch an Ordinance it was not a Sacrament as this is; now this being in a Sacramental way in the uſe of an Ordinance appointed by Jeſus Chriſt to ſet forth his ſufferings, and al the riches of the Covenant of grace to the ſoul, there may be expected here a further bleſſing than in the other, though it's true the other might work mightily upon the heart but yet this being a great ordinance of Chriſt in the Church, a great inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt for the ſetting out of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, it hath a more ſpecial bleſſing that goes along with it; every Ordinance hath a promiſe, and a more ſpecial bleſſing than any other thing that is not an Ordinance. So when you come here to behold Chriſt crucified before you, you cannot ſee Chriſt naturally crucified as upon the Croſs: but you have Chriſt crucified before you in the way of a Sacrament, in the way of a ſolemn inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, that hath a ſpecial bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which goes along with it; therfore if the heart be not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here, there is an aggravation of the hardneſs of the heart as great as if we ſhould behold Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs and our hearts not broken there; and indeed this is a ſpecial reaſon why thoſe are ſaid to be guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt that receive unworthily; as if a man had been then alive and had been before the Croſs; and there have ſeen how the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, was ſhed for ſin, and ſhould not have been affected with it, but ſhould have accounted it as a common thing, this man in ſome regard might have been ſaid to be guilty of His death; that is, to have joyned and conſented with thoſe that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> crucifie Him; for if a man ſees another commit a ſin, if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:104284:105"/>
affected with that ſin, and it does not ſtir his heart, he may come to be partaker of his ſin; ſo that thoſe that come to ſee Jeſus Chriſt crucified, and have not their hearts at all ſtir'd with the crucifying of Chriſt, they are in ſom regard truly ſaid to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; And that's the ſecond thing, brokenneſs of ſpirit is ſutable to the light of a broken Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Third thing that is here to be done in the Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Name, is the purging and clensing of the heart from ſin; and actuall clenſing and purging the heart from ſin there ought to be. The Jews in there Paſſover were to caſt out all leaven and thoſe that were of the cuſtom of the Jews, ſay that they were wont to do three things in the caſting out of their Leaven:</p>
            <p n="1">1. they made diligent ſearch for Leaven; they lighted Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles to look into every corner leſt there ſhould be any bit of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven left in the houſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they found it they caſt it out.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They uſed an execration, they did curſe themſelves if they ſhould willingly keep any leaven in the houſe.</p>
            <p>So my brethren, when we come to partake of this holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, there ſhould be a diligent inquiſition for ſin, for ſin in Scripture is compared to leaven; thou ſhouldeſt make a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch what ſin there is in thy heart, in any of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thy ſoul, what ſin there is in thy thoughts, in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in thy underſtanding, in thy will, in any of thy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what ſin there hath been in thy life, what family ſins, what perſonall ſins. thou ſhouldeſt make a diligent ſearch to ſee whether there be not ſome leaven, ſome evil in thy heart; and what ever ſin thou ſhalt come to find out in thy heart, there muſt be a caſting of it out; that is, thy ſoul muſt be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it to apoſe it with all thy might; what ever beloved ſin, whatever gainfull ſin, whatſoever become of thee, thy ſoul muſt renounce that ſin of thine; yea and in a kind of execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy life: that's thus, Lord, as ever I expect to receive any good by this Body and Blood of Chriſt, that I come now to receive, ſo Lord, here I profeſs againſt every ſin that I have found out in my heart; I deſire to find out all, and profeſs
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:104284:106"/>
againſt all, and renouuce all, and would do to the uttermoſt that I am able for delivering of my ſoul fully, from every known or beloved ſin; Oh that there might not be any remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in my heart: this muſt be the diſpoſition of the ſoul co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither, and it muſt needs be thus, or elſe we cannot ſanctifie Gods Name, becauſe there is nothing more ſutable than this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition unto the receiving of the Sacrament; for we come here to profeſs, That we do acknowledg that ſin did coſt ſo much as it did, that it coſt the Blood of the Son of God; now this cannot chuſe but cauſe the heart to renonnce ſin; If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I do beleeve that ſin hath coſt the Blood of Chriſt, that it coſt him ſo deer as it did, that it did trouble Heaven and Earth, that there muſt be ſuch a mighty wonderful way of ſatisfaction to God for my ſin committed againſt him, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſin hath a dreadful evil in it, Oh let me never have to do with ſuch ſin that was the cauſe of ſuch ſufferings to my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior that did ſhed his Blood. If ſo be that thou ſaweſt a knife that had cut the throat of thy deareſt child, would not thy heart riſe againſt that knife? Suppoſe you come to a Table, and there is a Knife laid at your Trencher, and it was told you, This is the Knife that cut the Throat of your Child, or Father, if you could uſe that Knife as another Knife, would not any one ſay, There was but little love to your Father or Child: So when there is a Temptation comes to any ſin, this is the Knife that cut the Throat of Chriſt, that pierc'd his Sides, that was the cauſe of all his ſufferings, that made Chriſt to be a curſe; now wilt not thou look upon that as a curſed thing that made Chriſt to be a curſe? Oh with what deteſtation would a man or woman fling away ſuch a Knife! and with the like deteſtation it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that thou ſhouldeſt renounce ſin, for that was the cauſe of the death of Chriſt. I remember it is reported of <hi>Anthony.</hi> when <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſlain, he comes to ſtir up the people againſt thoſe that had ſlain <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and he takes the cloaths that were bloody, and holds them forth to the people, and ſaith, Here is blood of your Emperor; and upon that the people were enraged againſt thoſe that had ſlain him, and went and pulled down their houſes upon them: So when thou comeſt to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, thou ſeeſt the blood of Chriſt guſhing out, and for thy
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:104284:106"/>
ſin, if ever thy ſin be pardoned; either thy ſoul muſt be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damn'd for thy ſin, or elſe thy ſin coſt the guſhing out of the blood of Chriſt; now when thou ſeeſt this; this ſhould cauſe an holy rage in thy ſoul againſt ſin that cauſed this; ſurely the putting away ſin, the riſing of the heart againſt ſin muſt needs be a diſposition ſutable to ſuch an Ordinance as this is. And that's the Third thing required in ſanctifying of Gods Name in this Ordinance, the purging out of sin, and rising of the heart againſt it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Fourth thing that is to be done for the ſanctifying of Gods Name here, it is, the hungring and thirſting of the ſoul after Jeſus Chriſt; whoſoever comes hither, he comes to a feaſt, and the Lord exſpects that all his Gueſts ſhould come with ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs unto his feaſt, come with hungring and longing for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; this ſhould be the diſposition of the ſoul, Oh that my ſoul might enjoy Communion with Jeſus Chriſt; now, this is the end that I am come for; Oh! the Lord, that knows the workings of my heart, knowes that this is the great desire of my ſoul, that I might enjoy Communion with Jeſus Chriſt; Oh! that I might have more of Chriſt, that I might meet with Chriſt, that I might have ſome further manifeſtation of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt that I might have my ſoul further united to the Lord Chriſt, and ſo have further influence of Chriſt to my ſoul; I come with thirſt after the Lord Chriſt, knowing my infinite need of him, and the infinite excellency that there is in Jeſus Chriſt; my ſoul doth famiſh and periſh for ever without Chriſt; but in the enjoyment of Chriſt, there is a fulneſs for the ſatisfying of my ſoul; that I have had of Chriſt ſomtimes in the Word, and ſomtimes in Prayer, that have been ſweet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, but I expect a further communion with Chriſt here, for this is the grand Ordinance for Communion with Jeſus Chriſt; indeed the word in this reſpect it is beyond this Ordinance, that is it is not only for the increaſe of Grace, but for the begetting; This is only for the increaſe of Grace, and not appointed for the begetting; now in that reſpect the Word is above the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but now this Sacrament is a more full Ordinance for Communion with Jeſus Chriſt, this is the Communion of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his blood, and therfore there ought
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:104284:107"/>
to be hungring and thirſting deſires of the ſoul after Jeſus Chriſt, therefore you muſt take heed you do not come with your ſtomachs full of traſh, as children when they can get Plums and Pears and fill their ſtomachs with them, when they come to your Tables, though there be never ſo much whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome diet, they have no mind at all to it; ſo it is with men of the world, they fill their hearts with the traſh of this world, and with ſenſual delights, and hence it is that when they come to ſuch a great Ordinance to enjoy communion with Jeſus Chriſt, that then they feel no want at all of Chriſt, only they come and take a little piece of bread and a draught of wine, but for any ſtrong pauſing deſires to meet with Jeſus Chriſt there in the Ordinance, to come ſo as they know not how to live without Chriſt, even as a man that is an hungred cannot live without his meat and drink; and ſo for the ſoul to have ſuch a diſpoſition after Chriſt, this is a rare thing; but know that Gods Name is not ſanctified, unleſs thou doeſt come in ſuch a way unto his holy Sacrament; that's the fourth thing, hungry and thirſty deſires after Chriſt, from a deep ſence of the need of him, and the apprehenſion of the excellency in him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the fift place there muſt be an exerciſe of faith for the Sanctifying of Gods Name here; Faith that is both the hand and the mouth of the taking of this ſpiritual meat; and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al drink; when thou comeſt to the Feaſt of the Lord, Faith firſt is the eye, and then the hand and mouth; it is the eye of thy ſoul to give a real ſight to what there is here, you are not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the body of the Lord but by the eye of Faith; if thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt only with bodily eyes to look upon what is here, thou ſeeſt nothing but a little Bread and Wine; but now where the eye of Faith is, there is a real apperance of Jeſus Chriſt to the ſoul, as if Chriſt were bodily preſent, and we need not have the bread truned in to his body; for Faith cannot ſee the body of Chriſt through the bread, and the blood of Chriſt guſhing in the Wine. And it is a mighty thing to have Chriſt and ſuch ſprituall things made real and not to be a fanſie. If one look upon the fire that is painted, one cannot heat ones ſelf in cold wether with that, but fire that is really burning upon the harth; ſo thoſe that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:104284:107"/>
come to receive the Sacrament, and not come with Faith, that have only the eye of their bodies, they only ſee as it were a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſt, they do not ſee Chriſt really, his body and blood and thoſe great myſteries of the Goſpel are not preſented as real things to their ſouls; and hence it is that they go away and get nothing; but now when the ſoul comes with the eye of Faith, the ſoul ſees the wonderful things of God, it is the moſt glorious sight in the world; al the glory of God in the Heavens and Earth is not like this Sight of Jeſus Chriſt and the myſteries of the Goſpel that do appear to the eye of Faith; therefore you may by this know whether you have come with Faith or no to the Sacrament, whether you have ſeen the moſt glorious Sight that ever your eyes did behold, Alas! with our natural eyes, we behold a Miniſter coming with a piece of Bread, and a little Wine: but when the eye of Faith is opened, then we behold the glorious things of the Goſpel: Many times when you come to hear the Word, your hearts burn within you; as they that went to <hi>Emaus;</hi> but when you are breaking bread, the eye of Faith that muſt look upon Jeſus Chriſt: and in this ſenſe, thoſe that have pierced Chriſt muſt look upon him; that Scripture is fulfilled in <hi>Zachariah,</hi> 12. latter end, They ſhall look on him whom they have pierced by their Sins, and then mourn and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: This eye of Faith will cauſe mourning and lamenting for Sin.</p>
            <p>And then, As Faith is the eye to make what is here real, ſo Faith is the hand to take it: When you come to a feaſt, you muſt have ſomething to take the meat to you: ſo ſaith Chriſt, he brake bread, and gave it unto his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Take, eat this.</hi> Take it; how ſhal we take it? By reaching out of the hand; if you ſanctifie Gods Name in this Ordinance, as you reach out your hand to take the Bread and Wine, ſo there muſt be an actual reaching out of the ſoul by Faith, putting forth an act of Faith to receive Jeſus Chriſt unto the ſoul, to apply the Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto thy ſoul with all his merits and good things that he hath purchaſed; when the Miniſter doth give out that Ordinance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhould look upon God the Father giving out his Son; as if this were your condition I am now in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the eternal Father, who now doth actually give out
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:104284:108"/>
his Son to my ſoul; and ſaith Soul, here receive a new this day, my Son with all that he hath purchaſed for thy good; now then the ſoul acts upon this, and by ſtirring up an act of faith, comes and cloſes with this gift of the Father and caſts its ſelfe upon Jeſus Chriſt, and ſaith as it were, <hi>Amen:</hi> to what the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives, Oh Lord, here I come and imbrace thy Son as my life, as my Savior, as the Fountain of all my good, in whom I expect all the good I am like to have either here or to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; ſo that there muſt be a ſtirring up of the act of faith in an actual taking of Chriſt, if thou beeſt a Beleever; Canſt thou remember what thou didſt, when firſt thou didſt take Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; when the Lord in the preaching of His word did reveal Jeſus Chriſt to my ſoul, what didſt thou then, Oh ſoul; how did thy ſoul work in cloſing with Chriſt; as thy ſoul did then in cloſing with Chriſt, ſo it muſt now renew the work; there muſt be a renewal of the work at that time. So that when you come to the Sacrament, you muſt not think that it is then a time to liſten to doubts, fears, and Scruples; no, but it is a time that God cals for the exerciſe of faith, the caſting of the ſoul upon Chriſt, and His merits for life and for ſalvation, or elſe the Name of God is not ſanctified as it ought; thou doeſt not Sanctifie Gods Name, when thou art buſying thy ſoul in doubts and ſcruples in thy receiving of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And then faith is as the mouth; when thou comeſt to eat and drink, how canſt thou if thou haſt not a mouth; thou haſt a bodily mouth to take in Bread and Wine; but know that without faith thy ſoul cannot take in Chriſt; faith is as it were the mouth; that is, by the act of faith the ſoul doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it ſelf for Jeſus Chriſt, and not only opens it ſelf, but takes in Chriſt, to the ſoul, and makes Chriſt and the ſoul as one, as our Bread and Wine is made one with our Body, ſo faith takes in Chriſt, and makes him as one with thee, and turns Chriſt into the nouriſhment of thy ſoul, and thou and Chriſt by faith are made as truly one, as the Bread and Wine that is put into thy Body, is made one with thy body. This is the work of faith, without which we cannot Sanctifie the Name of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:104284:108"/>
Sixthly, There muſt be ſpiritual Joy; that muſt be exerciſed here; for it is a feaſt; here we come to ſit with Chriſt at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we come as Children to our fathers Table, and to ſit there with Jeſus Chriſt our Elder Brother; now as a father doth not love to have his child ſit in a ſullen and dogged way at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or to be crying, but he would have the child ſit in comfort and with a holy cheerfulnes with a holy freedom of ſpirit; not in a ſullen way, but as a child in the preſence of his father, and not as a ſervant with the maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obiect.</hi> You told us before, that there ſhould be brokenneſs of ſpirit and ſence of our ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That may be, and joy; we rejoyce with trembling; therefore that brokenneſe of ſpirit that I meant, muſt not be ſlaviſh horror and fear, but a kindly melting of the ſoul from the apprehenſion of the love of God unto it in Jeſus Chriſt, that was willing to be at ſo great coſt to purchaſe the pardon of ſin: ſuch a gracious mourning as may ſtand with joy; and the truth is, that, that ſorrow for ſin in the Sacrament that is not mixt with joy, is a ſorrow that doth not Sanctifie Gods Name; godly ſorrow and evangelical joy may ſtand together very well. And therefore know that this is not the time, neither to give liberty to have your hearts ſink; no, there muſt be no ſinking ſorrow of heart, but ſuch a ſorrow of heart as in the midſt of it you may be able to look upon God as a reconciled Father to you, and have a cheerfulneſs of ſpirit as in the preſence of God; you muſt look upon your ſelves as Gods gueſts, to be merry at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; now this is a great myſtery of godlineſs; that there ſhould be at the ſame time the ſight of Chriſt crucified, and yet at the ſame time a ſpiritual cheerfulneſs in the aſſurance of the love of God in Jeſus Chriſt. I ſay, it is a myſtery, and only thoſe that are Beleevers are able to underſtand this myſtery, how to have their hearts break, and yet how to rejoyce at the ſame time in that unſpeakable love of God that is here preſented unto them in this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, In the next place, There muſt be thankfulneſs; therefore it is called the Euchariſt, and in one of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts where it is ſaid, Chriſt bleſt the Bread, in another it is ſaid, Chriſt gave thanks; Chriſt when he inſtituted this Sacrament,

he gave thanks he gave thanks; for what? he gave thanks to God the Father that he was pleaſed to ſend him into the world to die for poor ſouls; now ſhall Jeſus Chriſt give thanks unto God the Father for that which did coſt him his life? yea ſaith Chriſt, I ſee that here is a way to ſave ſouls, and let it coſt me my life if it will, yet I bleſs thee O Father, if ſouls may come to be ſaved though it coſt me my life. Chriſt rejoyced in his Spirit in thanking his Father for this; then how ſhould our hearts be enlarged with thankfulneſs when we come to this, that the Ancients were wont to call the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that is, a thankſgiving? we are to give God thanks for every mercy, you will not eat your own bread without giving of thanks; but when we come to have this bread, this bread of life, here is matter of thankfulneſs, here is matter of enlargment of ſoul; thou that haſt the deadeſt and dulleſt ſoul; and ſtraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Spirit, yet when thou comeſt hither and underſtandeſt what thou doeſt, here thou canſt not but ſee matter for the enlargment of thy heart, and wiſh that thou hadſt ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand times more ſtrength to expreſs the praiſes of the Lord; here is a thing that muſt be the ſubject of the <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs</hi> and doxologies, that Angels and Saints muſt for ever ſound out in the higheſt Heavens; doſt thou know what the Lord preſents to thee here? it is more than if the Lord ſhould ſay, I will make ten thouſand worlds for the ſake of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and give all theſe worlds to him, thou wouldeſt think that thou wert bound to bleſs him then; only when God in Bread and Wine, reaches out to the, the body and Blood of his Son, here is more matter of praiſe, then if ten thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand worlds were given to thee, and therefore God expects that thou ſhouldeſt ſay to thy ſoul, <hi>My ſoul praiſe thou the Lord, and all that is within me praiſe His holy Name; bleſs the Lord O my ſoul, and forget not all His benefits; who forgiteth all thine iniquitie, who healeth all thy diſeaſes;</hi> O poor ſoul, here is the foundation of all mercies; doſt thou praiſe God for Juſtification, for ſanctification? here is a glorious application of the mercie of God to the ſouls of ſinners, and therefore if ever thou wert thankfull, be thankfull here. The Sabbath my Brethren, that is appointed to be the ſet conſtant day of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:104284:109"/>
thankſgiving for the great mercies of God in Chriſt, and there are other daies for National mercies; now a ſpecial work of the Lords day, is, The celebration of this holy Sacrament; and the Chriſtians in former times were wont to do it every Lords day, becauſe that is the day appointed by God for to be the day of thankſgiving for that great mercy; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and that's the reaſon why the Sabbath was changed; the laſt day in the week was the Jewiſh Sabbath, and that was to celebrate the memorial of the Creation of the World; and the firſt day now, it is to be the day of thankſgiving for al the work of God in mans Redemption.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, A further thing is this, If you would ſanctifie Gods Name, you muſt be willing to renew your Covenant; that's the end of it; there muſt be an actual renewing of your Covenant with God, that's thus, I come to receive this Bread &amp; this wine, and this is to be as the Seal of the Covenant on Gods part: now this will be emplied in the nature of the thing, that if I take the Seals of Gods Covenant, that I muſt be willing to ſet to my Seal too, to renew the Covenant that God calls me to; now know, all men and women that are ſav'd, they are ſav'd by the vertue of the Covenant of Grace; and there God on his part promiſes and makes a Cavenant, That he will beſtow his Son, Life and Salvation through him; and thou muſt likewiſe come in on thy part, and beleeve on his Son, and repent, which is the Tenour of the Goſpel; now every time thou comeſt to receive this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou comeſt to renew this Covenant; As if thou ſhouldeſt ſay, Lord, thou haſt been pleaſed to make a Covenant of Grace; as the firſt Covenant was broken, and all men were caſt by that Covenant, now thou haſt made a Covenant of Grace, and calleſt thy ſervants whom thou intendeſt to ſave, that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Covenant with thee in this Sacrament of thine; Lord, here I come, and Lord, here I renew it and ſet to my ſeal, to promiſe and Covenant with thee, That as ever I expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any good from Chriſt, ſo Lord, here I will be thine, I will give up my ſelf for ever to thee; as thou haſt given me the Body and Blood of Chriſt for my ſalvation, ſo Lord, here I conſecrate my body and blood to thee, the laſt drop of my
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:104284:110"/>
heart blood ſhall be given to thee, and ſo my ſtrength and eſtate, and name, or what ever I am or have ſhall be thine Have you done thus when you have come to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? have you actually renewed your covenant with God? you that have taken the body of Chriſt, have you given up your body to Chriſt? What's the reaſon then that you ſin ſo much with your bodies? that you abbuſe your body with uncleanneſs, and drunkenneſs, and other wickedneſs afterwards? Oh you prophane the name of God, and the very Body and Blood of Chriſt in this, except thou giveſt up the body and ſoul to God in way of Covenant:</p>
            <p>Ninthly, in the laſt place, for the ſanctifying of Gods Name there is required the renewing of Love; the coming with lovely diſpoſitions and the renewing of the grace of love, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards God, but towards our Brethren; for it is the feaſt of the Lord, and it is an act of communion, Communion, not only with Chriſt, but with His Churches, with his ſaints; and as I have told you that there is a profeſſion of our ſelves to be of the ſame body with Jeſus Chriſt, then the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that His Children ſhould not fall out that come to His Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but that there ſhould be love and peace; there's a mighty bond upon thee when thou comeſt to the Sacrament; and therefore, firſt, all heart burnings, and heart grudges, muſt be laid aſide; and ſecondly you muſt come with a willinneſs to be reconcilled one to another, willingneſ to paſs by all infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in thy Brethren; here I have the Seal of Gods wlling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to paſs by al my ſins. and therefore I muſt be willing to paſs by all infirmities in my Brethren; I muſt now caſt out all ill wiſhes towards others, and come with a diſire of all good unto them; and with a heart ready to imbrace any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do any good; thou doeſt lye unto God except thou comeſt with ſuch a heart as this is; Lord, thou knoweſt that I am willing to take all opportunities to do good to thoſe, that I now do communicate with, for it is the neereſt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that poſſible can be in this world, between one Creature and another, and this is the reaſon why there ſhould be that Ordinance of Chriſt ſet up every where, to caſt out thoſe that are unworthy, becauſe it is the greateſt union and Communion
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:104284:110"/>
that poſſibly can be, for it is the Sacrament and Communion of the ſame body, they are the ſame Members of Chriſt: Now if thou doeſt not think ſuch an one to be a Member of Chriſt; why doeſt not thou do what thou canſt to have him caſt out, but ſo long as thou haſt done nothing in private to him, or in telling the Church, thou doeſt own him to be a Member of Jeſus Chriſt; if thou doeſt ſo, take heed how thy heart be eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from him, take heed how thou behaveſt thy ſelf to them; take heed how thou liveſt in a jarring, and a contentious way with them, and holdeſt them off at ſtaves end, or walking at a diſtance from them, though they be never ſo poor and mean, know that thou doeſt prophane this holy Ordinance every time thou comeſt to it when thou comeſt with ſuch an heart as this is; if thou doſt not find this renewed love, Lord, there began to be a ſtrangeneſs between me, and thoſe that have communicated with me, but Lord, thou art pleaſed to vouchſafe us to come once more to this Ordinance, and Lord, here we do profeſs, that this Ordinance ſhall unite our hearts together more than ever they were; I will ſtudy to do what good poſſibly I can to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that as we joyn here to the feaſt of the Lord with comfort, ſo we may live together in peace &amp; love as it becomes the Saints of God, and the Members of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; Oh how far are people from any ſuch work of God as this is! The Lord expects this ſhould be in you every time you come to the holy Communion. Here hath been Nine particulars now mentioned for the ſanctifying of the Name of God when we come to partake of the Sacrament; but O Lord, what cauſe have we to lay our hands upon our hearts! for if this be to ſanctifie thy Name then it hath been a riddle, a myſterie to us; Certainly my brethren, theſe things are the Truths of God which I have delivered, and ſo fare as you have been wanting in any of theſe, know, ſo far you have taken Gods Name in vain is this holy Ordinance, you have not been worthy receivers of this Sacrament, you have cauſe to look back to your former waies, and ſpend much humiliation for your ſin herein, and not to be ſo greedy of it as ſome are; they muſt have the Communion, but I put it to your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Have you repented you for the profaning of Gods Name? And that's that we ſhould further have ſpoken of, That <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:104284:111"/>
               <hi>will be ſanctified;</hi> that's thus, If we do not ſanctifie Gods Name, it will quite turn to the contrary; it is the proper end of the Sacrament, to ſeal up our ſalvation: but if we ſanctifie not Gods Name, it will ſeal up our condemnation; if it hath not been thy endeavor to ſanctifie the Name of God, ſo many times as thou haſt received the Sacrament, ſo many ſeals haſt thou upon thee for the ſealing up of thy condemnation.</p>
            <p>But yet for thy comfort, while thou art alive, it is poſſible that theſe ſels may be broken open; as we reade in the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that <hi>John ſaw</hi> the Book that had ſeven ſeals upon it, and none could be found that was able to open it; at length the Lamb that was ſlain he was found worthy to open the Book: So I ſay, thy condemnation is ſealed up with many ſeals, and there is no creature that is able to conceal theſe ſeals, only the Lamb, Jeſus Chriſt; yea, that Chriſt whoſe blood thou haſt ſhed and been guilty of, only he is worthy; and he is willing to open theſe ſeals; for as it was with thoſe that did crucifie Chriſt, yet they were ſaved by the ſame blood that thay had ſhed, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. So though thou haſt been guilty of ſhedding the blood of Chriſt again and again, by thy prophane coming to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, yet know, ſeeing there is life in thee, and the day of Grace is continued, it is poſſible that thy ſoul may be ſav'd by that blood that thou haſt crucified: Oh how many are cut off that have thus prophaned the Name of God in this Sacrament, and never came to underſtand this danger! they are cut off, and now are undone for ever; then bleſs God that thou art alive to hear more about this Sacrament, and how Gods Name ſhould be ſanctified; that thou art alive, and haſt time to repent the of this great evil, of prophaning the Name of God in this holy Sacrament.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is one thing more about the Sanctifying the Name of God in the Sacrament which cleerly concerns us; and that is,</p>
            <p>To keep the Inſtitution of the Sacrament; for this is ſuch a Worſhip of God, as depends meerly upon inſtitution; that is, upon a poſitive Law, upon the wil of God. There are ſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Worſhip which are natural, that we may know by the light of nature they are due to God; but the Sacrament is a duty of worſhip that is only by inſtitution; and if God had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it, we had not been bound to it; therefore in theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of inſtitution, God ſtands very punctual upon them; we muſt be very exact, neither to err on the right hand, nor the left; to make any alteration in the points of Inſtitution; Now therefore for the Inſtitution of this Sacrament we find it in divers of the Evangeliſts, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 26. there you ſhall find that Chriſt and his Diſciples they eat the Sacrament to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and this was the way of it; They were together ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the ſame Table; ſo it is called the Table of the Lord ſometimes in Scripture; therefore that's the firſt thing that is according to the inſtitution, that thoſe that do communicate muſt come to the Table as neer as they can; as many as can ſit about it, and all to come as neer as they can, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, Becauſe that otherwiſe you will not be able to attain the end why God ſhould have you come to receive; the end is to remember the death of Chriſt; now except pou be able to ſee the Sight, to ſee what is done, to have your eye as well as your ear exerciſed, you do not fully accompliſh the end that is appointed; for this is a Sacrament, that doth preſent to our
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:104284:112"/>
eyes the death of Chriſt, and the great myſteries of ſalvation, and therefore it is according to the inſtitution, that every Communicant muſt be where he may behold what is done, he muſt be where he may ſee the breaking of the Bread, and the powring forth of the Wine; Certainly it hath been a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way therefore for people to ſit up and down in their Pews every where in the Congregation, and for the Miniſter to go up and down after them; ſo that they could ſee nothing nor ſcarce hear any thing: It is much for the attaining the end of the inſtitution, for all Communicants to look upon the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Bread, and the powring forth of the Wine in the Sacrament, and therefore all ſhould come together; and there, as many as can ſit at his Table, or thoſe that cannot, neer to it; and the rather, becauſe this is not only from the example of Chriſt, that he did ſo, though that's ſome what; but becauſe it hath a ſpiritual ſignificancy in it, and that's the reaſon that it ſhould be done: we find in <hi>Luke,</hi> 22. 26. the inſtitution of the Sacrament; Now mark, upon their coming, and being with Chriſt at the Table, ſaith Chriſt in the 29, and 30. verſes, <hi>And I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me, that you may eat and drink at my Table in my Kingdom, and ſit on Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael: He ſpake it upon that occaſion of the Diſciples ſitting with him at the Table, when they did eat Bread; and when they took the Cup; upon that occaſion Chriſt ſpake to his Diſciples, and ſaid, I appoint you a Kingdom, that ye may eat and drink at my Table, in my Kingdom, that ye may eat and drink the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, You can ſit with me at my table here, and know, that this ſitting with me at my Table, it is but as it were a <hi>preludium,</hi> a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignification of the Communion that you ſhal have with me in my Kingdom; you ſhall have that familiar Communion with me when I come into my Kingdom, there to ſit (as it were) with me, to joyn with me in my Kingdom, judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael; even as you do now in that holy Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip joyn with me in ſitting at my Table: This is the meaning of Chriſt, ſo that the geſture in the Sacrament is not a meer indifferent thing; heretofore it hath been thought unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:104284:112"/>
to contend for what Geſture we ſhould uſe.</p>
            <p>Now that which hath been the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and hath a ſpiritual ſignificancy in it, is not indifferent; for not only the eating the Bread and drinking the Wine is ſignificative, but the geſture whereby we have fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt here, to ſignifie that fellowſhip we ſhall have with him in the Kingdom of Heaven; ſo that the people of God were depriv'd of a great deal of comfort, and of one ſpecial benefit of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereas they might not receive it ſitting; whereas Chriſt ſaith that your ſitting with me here is a ſignification of your ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with me when I come into the Kingdom of Heaven. Some ſay they muſt kneel becauſe they may receive it with more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; certainly were it a thing as ſome ſay indifferent, it were another matter; but for to ſay it is not reverence to ſit, in that they accuſe Chriſt himſelf for want of reverence, as if he would appoint a way, or would have his Diſciples uſe any ſuch way as were not reverent: ſaith Chriſt, I intend by your very geſture to have this ſignified unto you, that though you be poor wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched worms, yea, even ſuch is my love unto you, as you ſhal ſit with me when I come to my Kingdom, and judg the twelve Tribes of Iſrael; and every time you come to my Table, and there ſit at it, or about it, then you ſhould be put in mind that there is a time, that though you be poor unworthy creatures, worthy to be among the dogs, yet the mercy of God is ſuch unto us, as he hath appointed us to have a familiar fellowſhip with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt when we come in his Kingdom to ſit with him, and even to judg the twelve Tribes of Iſrael; yea, to judg the whol world, for ſo ſaith the Scripture: Shall not the Saints judg the world? now this hinders ſpiritual medication and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that the Saints have, therefore we are to look to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and follow it: That's the firſt thing in ſitting with Chriſt at his Table.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing in the inſtitution is, That the Bread being taken by the Miniſter, is to be bleſſed, broken, and then to be given; Chriſt took it, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it: and the people they are to look upon all this, to look upon the Miniſters taking, bleſſing, breaking, and giving; and then the Cup by its ſelf: we find Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 27. he firſt
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:104284:113"/>
bleſt the Bread, and then he bleſt the Cup diſtinctly by it ſelf, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This is my blood of the new Teſtament which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> and you ſhall obſerve that the text ſaith, <hi>he drank it</hi> and ſaid <hi>drink ye all of it;</hi> ſo that this is not according to the inſtitution, for a Miniſter to go up and down, and to give it into every mans hand; certainly this was not ſo from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; this is a way of mans own deviſing; for the bread and the cup to be given into every bodies hand by the Miniſter: Chriſt did but give it once, he gave it to them all, and ſaid, <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> ſo it was done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ſay, Is it not better for to be given into every ones hand?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, becauſe that the giving of it once for all, doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie more fully the fellowſhip and communion that they have together; as at a Table it were a ſtrange thing that every bit of meat muſt be given to every one particularly; no, but the diſhes muſt be ſet before them, and they muſt take it themſelves: Indeed if they be children you cut every piece of meat, and give it into their hands or mouths; but that's ſutable to a fellowſhip at Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Communion; to have the meat ſet before them, being bleſt, and then for all to partake of it.</p>
            <p>And beſides this, giving it into every ones hand, certainly, it came to us from a Popiſh and ſuperſtitous conceit of the Papiſts; for the Papiſts will give it into their mouths, becauſe the people muſt not defile it with their hands. And it was to bring more reverence to the Sacrament; now there's a great deal of danger for to bring in mens devices for to cauſe more reverence; we are to look to the Ordinance of Chriſt, he gave it once, and ſaid Drink ye all of it, in general to them all; and ſo the Miniſters ſhould do.</p>
            <p>And beſides there is this in it more, and one would wonder that Miniſters ſhould give it in particular and not in general to the Church: for by this means Miniſters might abundantly eaſe themſelves of a great deal of charge and guilt; for upon this ground it will appear, that a Miniſter, though as an eminent Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer he is to look to his Congregation that they be fit, yet the truth is, it concerns the Church as well to look who comes there, and likewiſe the Miniſter I ſay, to look about him that he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:104284:113"/>
doth not ſay, <hi>The Body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was given to thee,</hi> when he knows they are prophane and wicked; it concerns the Miniſter to look that he doth not tell a lye; but now when the Miniſter gives it generally to the Church, <hi>Take, eat,</hi> and <hi>Take, drink,</hi> he gives it particularly to no body; Now then his charge is divided to the Church, and if there be any body that is unworthy, let the Church look to it as well as he: though he as an eminent Officer, it's more eſpecially in particular his duty than any others; heretofore the charge would lie much upon the Miniſter, but the Miniſter according to the Inſtitution, ſhould give the Sacrament to no particular, but in generall to the Church, and therefore if there were but any particular, that the Miniſter upon a particular knowledg did know to be naught, he might in great part diſcharge himſelf, as profeſſing againſt this or that particular man; for it is not in his power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to keep any from the Sacrament, but if ſo be that he ſhall profeſs againſt ſuch and ſuch men, the Church muſt joyn with him to labor to keep them from the Sacrament, and that is the next thing for the inſtitution, Chriſt gave it not into any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mens hands, but he gave it to all, ſaying, Drink, and eat ye all of it.</p>
            <p>A third thing that is to be obſerved for the inſtitution, of this; that all the while the Communicants are taking, eating, and drinking the Bread and Wine, they ſhould all of them that while have their thoughts exerciſed about the death of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; for that's the inſtitution; <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> there ſhould be no action intermingled, in the time of the receiving of the Sacrament; nothing but minding the work that you are about, that is, to remember the death of Jeſus Chriſt; and to diſcern the Body of the Lord, not only when you your ſelves take the Bread and Wine; but when you ſee the Bread and Wine, broken or powred forth, and you ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers taking the Bread and Wine, all that while, you ſhould be thinking of the death of Chriſt, and diſcerning the Lords Body; and conſider what theſe outward clements do ſignifie, and that they do ſeal the great benefit of the Covenant of Grace; therfore it is not according to the Inſtitution to be ſinging of Pſalms in the mean time while the Sacrament is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:104284:114"/>
and ſo to have your thoughts about other things: ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of pſalmes in its due time is a good thing; but for you to do it at that time when as the death of Chriſt is preſented before you, and Chriſt calls you to look upon his body, and to think upon what he hath done and ſuffered; this is no ſeaſonable, time of ſinging; and if you read the inſtitution, you ſhall find, that Chriſt, after all was done (the text ſaith) they ſang an Hymn; ſo that according to the inſtitution, it is after the action is done of eating and drinking, then for the Church to joyn together and ſing a pſalm in the praiſe of God; and then they muſt mind all, the ſame thing together, for that's the thing to be done in the Sacrament, that look what one doth, al muſt mind together; for when one part ſings, and the other are waiting for the Bread and Wine, this is not ſutable to the holy Table-Action, and that Communion that God requires of us; though the things in themſelves are both good that are doing, yet when we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this holy Ordinance, being it is an Ordinance for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, all are to be doing the ſame thing at the ſame time; and ſo when all have done eating and drinking, then for all to joyn together to the praiſe of God.</p>
            <p>Now it may be, this at firſt ſeems ſtrang to many; yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly obſerve this, Do but keep to the inſtitution in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though you may think it a more mean way, yet you will find a greater beauty in this Ordinance than ever you found in all your lives; for the more we keep to Chriſts inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and mingle nothing of our own, the more glory and beauty, and excellency doth appear in the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt; but when any man ſhall mix any of his own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though he may do it to a good end, and think to add to, and put a greater luſtre upon the Sacrament: the truth is, that wich he thinks to be a greater luſtre, reverence, or hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or put upon it, it doth rather take off the luſtre and glory of the Sacrament; then are the inſtitutions of Chriſt glorious when there is no mixture among them; thus we ſhould ſanctifie the Name of God, in receiving this holy Sacrament. You have had divers things propounded to you, whereby you may come to know and eaſily to ſee that there hath been a great deal of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:104284:114"/>
diſhonor done to this Sacrament, and the beauty and glory of it hath been darkened, and the ſweet that the Saints might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have received in partaking, hath been exceedingly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. There is but one thing more that I ſhal propound to you, and that is, <hi>The ſeveral Meditations that we ſhould meditate on in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament;</hi> the moſt concerning <hi>Meditations</hi> are ſuggeſted in the holy Communion that are in any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, more concerning, more efficacious, more various Meditations we have ſuggeſted here than in any thing, and it is a great ſign that men and women do not diſcern the Lords Body, if ſo be their Meditations be barren at that time. I will therefore ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſome Nine or Ten Meditations that that Ordinance of God may hold out very plainly and familiarly to every Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, for the buſying of their thoughts all the time that action is a doing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meditation</hi> 1. As firſt, That the way of mans ſalvation it was by a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, it is not only by Gods mercy, Gods ſaying that he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by ſin, but he will be content to paſs it by; no, but it is through a Mediator: Now this Meditation is ſuggeſted thus, When I ſee the Bread and Wine, if I diſcern what that ſignifies it will hold out this to me, That the way of mans ſalvation, it is not meerly from hence, that God ſaith, Well, I will pardon them and no more, but there is required a great work of God to make an atonement between ſinners and himſelf; this Sacrament doth hold forth thus much unto us, wherefore elſe have we Bread and Wine, but to ſignifie that the way of our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it muſt be through a Mediator?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Med.</hi> 2. The Second Meditation is this, That this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor that ſtands between God and us, is verily and truly Man; he hath taken our Nature upon him: the Bread that puts us in mind of the Body of Chriſt, and the Wine, of his Blood, and therefore we are to meditate of the humane Nature of Jeſus Chriſt; and this is a Meditation that hath abundance that might ſpring out of it: What, hath the Son of God taken our Nature upon him? hath he Body and Blood, and human Nature upon him? Oh! how hath God honored humane Nature? Then let not me abuſe my Body to Luſt, to Wickedneſſe,

ſeeing that Jeſus Chriſt hath taken the body of man upon him, humane Nature upon him, let me honor humane Nature that is ſo neerly united to the Divine Nature. That's the ſecond Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Med.</hi> 3. Here is preſented unto us, what this Mediator hath done for the reconciling of us unto God, that his body was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; he hath ſubjected himſelf to the breaking of his body, and to the powring forth of his blood for the reconciling of us; it is not meerly (as before) that God ſaith <hi>I will pardon them;</hi> but Chriſt undertaking to make peace between his Father and us, it coſt him the breaking of his body, and the powring forth of his blood; this is an uſeful Meditation: Oh! what ſhould we be willing to ſuffer for Jeſus Chriſt in our bodies, even to reſiſt unto blood, ſeeing Chriſt hath been content to have his precious body broken, and his blood ſhed for us!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Med.</hi> 4. Again, A Fourth Meditation is this, That here we come to ſee we have occaſion of meditating of what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, That we are by the blood of God ſaved, it is the blood of God, <hi>They crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> that's the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe; we ſhould conſider when we ſee the Wine powred out, and ſo put in mind of blood; Whoſe blood and whoſe body is this? it is no other but the body and blood of him that was truly God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity. This is the great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel, and this is very needful for us to be think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of when we ſee the body broken, and the blood powred out: What, will the breaking of the body and ſhedding of the blood of a meer creature be ſufficient to make peace between God and Man? ſurely no: therfore you muſt meditate whoſe body this is, and whoſe blood this is; it is the body and blood of him that was God: It's true, God hath no body nor no blood, but the ſame perſon that was God, had a body and blood; that body and blood was united unto the Divine Nature in an hypoſtatical union, and from thence it came to have an efficacy for to ſatisfie God for to reconcile God and us together: This is the great Myſtery of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Med.</hi> 5. Another Meditation is this, When you ſee the Bread broken, and Wing powred out, Oh! the infinit dreadfulneſs of the Juſtice of God! how dreadful is the Juſtice of God, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:104284:115"/>
upon his own Son, and requiring ſatisfaction from him, that ſhould thus break him and bruiſe him, that ſhould have his blood, that ſhould require ſuch ſufferings even from his Son! dreadful is Gods Juſtice the Juſtice of God it is to be feared and to be trembled at; here we ſee what is required for the ſin of man, and nothing would be bated to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Med.</hi> 6. Another Meditation is this, Here I ſee preſented to me what every ſoul that ſhall be ſaved coſt; whoever ſhall have his ſoul ſaved, he hath it ſav'd by a ranſom, by a price paid that is more worth than ten thouſand thouſand worlds; thou ſlighteſt thine own ſoul; but if it prove to be ſaved, it coſt more than if thouſands of worlds had been given for thee; even the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the blood of Chriſt, every drop of which was more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than ten thouſand worlds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Med.</hi> 7. Again, From hence ſee what is the evil of ſin, how great it is, that hath made ſuch a breach between God and my ſoul, that only ſuch a way, and ſuch a means muſt take away my ſin; I muſt either have lain under the burden of my ſin eternally, or Jeſus Chriſt that's God and man muſt ſuffer ſo much for it; Oh what Meditations are theſe to take up the hearts of men!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Med.</hi> 8. Behold the infinit love of God to mankind, and the love of Jeſus Chriſt, that rather than God would ſee the children of men to periſh eternally, he would ſend his Son to take our Nature upon him, and thus to ſuffer ſuch dreadful things; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God ſhows his love; it is not the love of God ſo much in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you a good voyage, and proſpering you outwardly in the world; But, <hi>ſo God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son;</hi> And it pleaſed the Father to break his Son, and to powr out his blood, here is the love of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt: Oh! what a powerful, mighty, drawing, efficacious Meditation ſhould this be unto us!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Med.</hi> 9. Thoſe that are Beleevers they ſhall be nouriſhed to eternal life, ſo that there is no fear that ever a Beleever ſhould quite fall off from God and die in his ſin; Why? Becauſe the body and blood of Chriſt is given to him for his ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: though a Beleever be never ſo weak yet ſeeing God hath appointed the body and blood of his Son for him to feed upon and to drink in a ſpiritual way, ſurely then the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104284:116"/>
in the world will be ſtrengthened to go through all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and dangers that there are in the world; 'tis this that ſtrengthens Beleevers to encounter with all kind of dangers, it's this that preſerves the weakeſt grace in a Beleever, namely the Spiritual nouriſhment that God the Father hath appointed to them, even the feeding upon the Body, and drinking the very Blood of his Son; this is meat indeed, and drink indeed that will nouriſh to eternal life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Med.</hi> 10. The laſt Meditation is this, When you come to this, ſeeing the Bread broken, and the Wine powred out, you have an occaſion to meditate of the whol new Covenant, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, that God hath made with ſinners; for ſo the words of inſtitution are, This is the Cup of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the New Teſtament which is all one with the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, only different in this particular; it contains the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the new Covenant, but cal'd Teſtament in this regard; to ſhew that the Lord doth do all in the new Covenant, that is, he doth not only promiſe ſuch and ſuch mercies upon condition of our beleeving and repenting, but he doth work beleeving and repenting, and works grace, and therefore the ſame thing that is ſometime call'd a Covenant, is call'd a Teſtament; that is the will of God wherein the Lord doth bequeath his rich lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to his Children, to thoſe that ſhall be eternally ſaved, ſo that all the good things in the Covenant of Grace they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed by way of Teſtament as well as Covenant, and this is a mighty comfortable Meditation to the Saints; for indeed when they look upon the way of the Goſpel as in a way of Covenant, why then they think thus, This require ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of our parts to be done, and indeed God will keep Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on his part, but it may be we ſhall not keep Covenant on ours. and ſo we may fail at laſt; but now when thou lookeſt upon all the good things in the Goſpel diſpenſed in the way of a Teſtament, that is the Will of God, the Legacies that God doth bequeath to his Servants, this is a mighty comfort to the foul, that all the precious things of the Goſpel come to me in the way of a Teſtament and that's the meaning of the new Teſtament, that is, the mercies of God in Chriſt coming now in the way of another adminiſtration, than they did before;
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:104284:116"/>
'tis not only new in reſpect of the Covenant of Works that God made with <hi>Adam,</hi> but new in reſpect of the adminiſtration; our fore-fathers, the Patriarchs, they had the ſame things in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but adminiſtred in a darker way, and many differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there are; but now when we hear of the new Teſtament, there is preſented unto us all the riches of the Covenant of grace in the way of a Legacy, and in the adminiſtration of it with cleerneſs, and with a great deal of mercy and goodneſs of God, the terror and harſhneſs of the old adminiſtration being taken away. Now theſe are the meditations, by which we ſhould labor to ſanctifie our hearts, when we are receiving of the Sacrament; and in the working of theſe meditations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our hearts; we ſhal come to ſanctifie the Name of God, when we are drawing nigh to him in that holy Ordinance of his: thus for Meditation.</p>
            <p>The next thing when we are there, muſt be an actuating of theſe holy diſpoſitions that before we ſpake of; 'tis not enough for a Chriſtian to bring grace to the Sacrament: but there muſt be a ſtirring of that Grace at that time; or otherwiſe the Name of God is not ſanctified in receiving of the Sacrament and above al graces the actuating of the grace of faith; 'tis not enough that thou beeſt a Beleever, but thy faith muſt act at that very inſtant; as thus,</p>
            <p>Firſt, When thou heareſt the Miniſter in the Name of Chriſt ſay thus, This is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which was given for you, take, eat, thou ſhouldeſt have thy faith ſo acting upon the mercy of God, in giving Jeſus Chriſt, for the nouriſhment of thy ſoul to eternal life, as if thou didſt hear a voyce from Heaven, ſaying, Here is the Body of my Son given for thee particularly, take it and eat, apply it to thee, and ſo make Chriſt one with thee by faith, as the Bread is made one with thy Body when thou doeſt eat it.</p>
            <p>And then when thou comeſt to take hold of the Bread, thou art to put forth the act of faith, faith being as the hand of the ſoul, and at that inſtant, when thou takeſt the Bread and putteſt it into thy mouth to eat, thou ſhouldeſt ſtir up the act of faith afreſh, laying more hold upon Jeſus Chriſt; look as once thou didſt in thy firſt converſion, when Chriſt was preſented to thee
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:104284:117"/>
in the Word or in any other way there was an act of faith drawn forth whereby thy ſoul did caſt it ſelf, and roul it ſelf upon Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; ſo ſhouldeſt thou renew it; renew the ſame work of faith that thou didſt find in the very firſt conversion; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou ſhalt come to have renewed comfort in the renewing of that act: I might name thee other graces and diſpositions how there ſhould be a ſtirring and an acting of them; only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I leave all this Point with this Note, That grace is not enough for partaking the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, except there be an acting, and a ſtirring up of that grace; many Chriſtians are careful to prepare, and examine before whether they have grace or no; but at that time when they come to receive, then there is not a lively working and ſtirring of that grace, and ſo they come to loſe the comfort and benefit of that Ordinance. Thus much ſhall ſuffice for this point of ſanctifying Gods Name in receiving the holy Communion; I ſhall now come to the laſt Point, which is the Sanctifying the Name of God in <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>Sanctifying the Name of God in</hi> Prayer.</head>
               <p>NOW this Argument might take us up many Sermons; but upon occasion of the Daies of Prayer and Hmiliation, I have preached divers Sermons about the Point of Prayer; therefore I ſhall be brief, and only now reckon up together, and ſet before your view, the ſeveral things that are to be done for the Sanctifying of the Name of God in Prayer: Firſt, for Prayer in that we draw nigh to God, and it's a duty of Gods Worſhip, that I ſuppoſe all of you cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that it is a natural duty of Worſhip; the other was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted but this is natural; it's natural for the creature to draw nigh to God in Prayer, wherein the creature tenders up his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to God, and manifeſts his profeſſion of his dependance upon God for all good that he hath, and acknowledges God as the Author of all good, therefore this is Worſhip, and it's a great part of Worſhip, Prayer, it is ſuch a part of Worſhip as
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:104284:117"/>
ſometimes in Scripture it's put for the whol Worſhip of God, <hi>He that calls upon the Name of God ſhall be ſaved:</hi> that is, He that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips God aright, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 25. And, <hi>Powr out thy wrath upon the Heathen that know thee not, and on the Families that call not on thy Name;</hi> that do not <hi>pray;</hi> that is, that do not worſhip thee: There one part of Worſhip is put for the whol, as being a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Surely we muſt ſanctifie Gods Name in <hi>Prayer,</hi> for it is that which ſanctifies all things to us; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>Every thing is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Word of God, and Prayer.</hi> And if the Argument of Chriſt was right, as no queſtion but it was, That the Temple was greater than the Gold upon the Temple, becauſe the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did ſanctifie the Gold: And the Altar was greater than the Offering that was offered upon it, becauſe it did ſanctifie the Offering; then Prayer muſt needs be a mighty great Ordinance, a greater than any other, becauſe that it ſanctifies all things. The Word ſanctifies the Creatures; but Prayer ſanctifies the very Word unto our uſe; and therefore when we reade the Word, we are to pray for a ſanctified uſe of the Word: Prayer is a great Ordinance, a great Duty of Worſhip that ſanctifies all; Prayer hath a caſting voyce (as I may ſo ſay) in all the great works of God in the world, the great affairs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, the Kingdom of his Power, and the Kingdom of Chriſt; I ſay, Prayer hath a kind of a caſting voyce, and doth order, under God, the great things of the world, they are according to the prayers of the Saints, they bring down bleſſings upon the godly, they powr forth judgments upon the wicked; the prayers of the Saints they are the viols that are powred forth in a ſpecial manner upon the heads of the wicked; therefore Gods Name is to be ſanctified in Prayer.</p>
               <p>It is to be ſanctified, firſt in preparation; <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Thou wilt prepare their heart; thou wilt cauſe thine ear to hear:</hi> It is the Lord that prepareth the heart; and then he cauſes his ear to hear: and therefore in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7, we are there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to <hi>watch unto prayer;</hi> men and women ſhould keep a narrow watch over their hearts and minds, that they may not be hindred in their prayers, that they may be alwaies in a fit po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:104284:118"/>
to pray; watch unto prayer, it's that that would help us againſt many temptations to evil; if I give way not to ſuch and ſuch temptations, it will hinder my prayers: I ſhall not have that freedom and enlargement in prayer as otherwiſe, if I give way to ſuch and ſuch things, therefore let me take heed of this, or it will hinder my prayers. As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, this ſhould be the care of Chriſtians; then they are like to ſanctifie the Name of God in prayer, if this be their great care that there is nothing in the world that ſhall hinder their prayers; O let me take heed I do nothing to hinder my prayers; if I go abroad into company, and am merry and jocond, and there game and drink, and ſprot my ſelf in company; will not this hinder my prayers; will not this hinder the ſpiritualneſs of my heart in Communion with God in prayer, when I come home at night? I appeal to you, have you had that freedom in prayer, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards? ſurely no, therefore watch unto prayer.</p>
               <p>Now for the preparation of the heart to prayer, we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand either,</p>
               <p>Firſt, What is to be done in the courſe of ones life. Or.</p>
               <p>Secondly, What's to be done juſt when one comes to prayer. For the firſt, The courſe of ones life: labor to keep all things even and cleer between God and your ſouls; that ſo you may not come with ſhakles about your legs; with guiltineſs (I mean) upon your conſciences; men that have given way to any baſe ſinful way, when thay come to prayer, the guilt of there hearts doth even ſink them; but thoſe that can keep their peace with God in the courſe of thier lives, they have other manner of freedom in prayer, than you that walk looſly and contract guiltineſs upon your ſpirits.</p>
               <p>And then the ſecond thing is, To keep our hearts ſenſible of our continual dependance upon God; ſenſible how we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon God, for whatſoever we are, whatſoever we have, whatſoever we do; for the bleſſing of all is from God. The beams of the Sun do not ſo depend upon the Sun, as we upon God; that if he doth but withdraw Himſelf never ſo little from us, we all ſink down to nothing and periſh for ever; that ſoul that every day and hour is ſenſible of the infinite dependance it hath upon God for its preſent and eternal eſtate,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104284:118"/>
will be fit for prayer; and that ſhould be our care for to carry our ſelves, as any hour in the day, or minute in the hour, we might be fit to go to prayer; and that's one meaning of that place in the Theſſalonians <hi>Pray continually;</hi> not that every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſhould be praying, but that we ſhould keep our hearts in a praying frame; ſome of you when you have let out your paſſions and are in a diſtemper, what will you go to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er now? your conſcience will tell you that you are not fit to go to prayer at that time, <hi>Certainly if you be not fit to pray, you are not fit to live;</hi> you are in an ill condition at any time if you be not fit to pray; and there can be no excuſe whatſoever, that can be ſufficient to plead for your ſelves why you ſhould not be fit to pray at any time; there is that continual dependance upon God for all, and that need you have of the bleſſing of God for every thing, that there is reaſon you ſhould be in a fit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for praying at all times; but now when you come to prayer at the ſet time, then there ſhould be a ſpecial preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Firſt, You ſhould prepare your ſelves by getting freſh and powerful apprehenſions of the glory of God, before whom you go; prepare by meditation about the glory of that infinite God that you are now addreſſing your ſelf unto; poſſeſs your ſelves with thoughts and meditations of the glory of the great God; that's the firſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Labor to get your hearts ſenſible of what you go for. I am now going to God; for what? for pardon of ſin, or for aſſurance of his love; or for power againſt ſin; or for ſuch and ſuch mercies; let me by meditation work my heart to be ſenſible of theſe things that I am going to God for, to ſet a due price upon thoſe mercies that I am praying for, and to get my heart affected with them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Labor to get your hearts ſeparated from the world, and from all things that are here below in the world; and that ſhould have been a third thing in the courſe of your lives, you ſhould never let out your hearts to any creature, either to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes or pleaſures in the world ſo, but that you may have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of your hearts to call them when you will; to call them in to God in prayer; and then when you come to prayer
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:104284:119"/>
there ſhould be an actual ſeparation of your hearts from all things in the world; dedicating your ſelves to God for this time, as one that hath nothing to do with the world, nothing to do with anie thing but this dutie that now you are about; this is the preparation of your hearts to prayer in the courſe of your lives.</p>
               <p>Now then for the Prayer its ſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We muſt conſider of the Matter of Prayer.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, Of the Manner of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the Matter of it: We muſt look to it that it be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods will, 1 <hi>John,</hi> 5. 14. <hi>This is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth us;</hi> therfore for the Matter we muſt be ſure it muſt be good that we pray for; it muſt be for the Glorie of God, for the good of our ſelves, and the good of our Brethren.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the Glorie of God, that ſhould be the chief mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that we are to pray for; ſo Chriſt when he teacheth us to pray, he begins the very firſt Petition, <hi>Matthew,</hi> 6. 9, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy Name; thy Kingdom come; thy Will be done:</hi> Firſt begin with the Glorie of God, mind that in the chief place, above all other things. God gives you leave to pray for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things; but firſt for the Glorie of God, minding that before your own benefit; before the pardon of ſin, and your dailie bread; how few do ſanctifie Gods Name in this? people have little mind to pray, but when they are in outward afflictions, when they are upon their ſick beds then they wil pray; or at Sea in ſtorms, then they will pray, then it ſeems that the main matter of your prayer is onlie for your ſelves; but how hath the matters of the Glorie of the great God, and the good of the Churches taken your hearts all this while? how have your hearts been affected with this, that the Name of God hath been ſo little ſanctified in the world, and that the Kingdom of God hath not come, and that the Will of God hath not been done, have theſe things taken up your heart in prayer, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Glorie of God, and the good of Churches, though your ſelves have not anie particular intereſt in them? if theſe things did but take up your hearts in Prayer, then, when you are at Sea, you would remember the cauſe of the Churches, as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:104284:119"/>
much as your ſelves; the Church is as it were in the midſt of the Sea, toſt up and down and in a great ſtorm; now why do not you pray as earneſtly for the Kingdom of Chriſt among his Churches, as for your ſelves when you are in a ſtrom at ſea? yea, and ſpiritual things ſhould be the chief matter of your prayer; for they are the neareſt to the glory of God; though God hath his glory from other things, yet ſpiritual things are neereſt the glory of God; now in theſe daies of prayer, many will come to pray, that they might be freed from danger, that they might have outward peace; this is good; but ſpiritual things are the chief things; and therefore the ſtrength of your ſpirits ſhould be thus powered forth to God Oh that I could get my heart to God, and the aſſurance of the love of God! Oh that I could get the ſhine of his face! Oh that I could get power over ſuch and ſuch corruptions!</p>
               <p>And I beſeech you obſerve this, <hi>That ſpiritual things may be prayed for abſolutly; but outward things muſt be prayed for condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally.</hi> I may pray (and never put any condition in at all) That the Lord would pardon my ſins, and help me againſt my corruptions, &amp;c. But when I pray for the health of my body, I ought to pray, if this be according to thy wil, then reſtore me to the health of my body, or the health of my husband or the health of my wife; but thou maieſt pray, Lord, convert the ſoul of my husband or the ſoul of my wife, without any condition at al: When your eſtates at ſea are in danger, when you pray for them, you muſt make conditions, Lord, as thou ſeeſt beſt for me ſo do thou deale with me; this ſhewes the excellency that there is in ſpirituall things above outward things; ſurely ſpiritual things are more to be deſired, for they are to be prayed for abſolutly, and the others to be prayed for only conditionally. That's for the firſt.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, We are to pray for our owne good, God doth give us leave to do ſo; onely here comes in a Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether it be ſinfull to pray for afflictions, as ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſome will be ready to do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer. friſt, Take it abſolutely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we may not pray, that God would afflict us; becauſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:104284:120"/>
is in its ſelf materially an evil thing, and a fruit of the curſe, therefore we may not (I ſay) abſolutely pray for it: but thus far we may pray for afflictions disjunctively, conditionally comparatively.</p>
               <p>Disjunctively, thus, Lord, either grant unto me a ſanctified uſe of ſuch a mercie, or otherwiſe let me rather be without it; let me have a ſanctified uſe of my ſiknes, or otherwiſe let my ſickneſs be continued to me; thus now you may pray for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>Or thus, conditionally' Lord, if thou ſeeſt that my heart be ſo vile and wretched that I will abuſe (through my corruption) ſuch and ſuch mercies, Lord rather take them from me and let me be without them; if thou ſeeſt that there be no way to break this proud heart of mine but ſuch a way, Lord let that be thy way to break it, if thou ſeeſt it according to thy will as the fitteſt way.</p>
               <p>Then comparatively thus, Lord rather let me have any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffiction then ſin, rather let me ſuffer loſs of my eſtate than ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, than depart from thee: any thing Lord rather than ſin. Thus you may pray for afflictions, but not abſolutly. You muſt not pray that God would ſend you afflictions abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, for you do not know your hearts; it may be if afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould come, your hearts may be as ſtubborn under your afflictions as they are now; for affliction hath no power in it ſelf to do us any good.</p>
               <p>And then for the good of others, for Chriſt teaches us to pray, <hi>Our Father &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>There comes in here a rebuke of the wicked practice of divers in curſing, and then a queſtion about it.</p>
               <p>It is a wicked thing to uſe curſes; but it's a moſt wicked thing to wiſh evil to others in way of prayer; yet how manie doe ſo! though it may be they do not think it, they ſpeak to God, and deſire him to bring ſuch and ſuch evils upon their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; yea, ſomtimes parents, upon their children; this is a wicked practice of men; what, is it not wickedneſs enough for thee to have any deſire that there ſhould any evil befall thy brother, but wilt thou dare to preſume to call God to be an inſtrument of the execution of thy baſe ſinfull wrath, that
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:104284:120"/>
God muſt be a drudg (as it were) to thy wrath, and to thy paſſion? this is abominable wickedneſs. Any of you that ever have been guilty of this ſin, of curſing others, Wives, Children, Servants, or Friends, the Lord rebuke you for this ſin; how far haſt thou been from ſanctifying Gods Name in Prayer? whereas inſtead of ſanctifying the holy Name of God, thou haſt called God to be a ſervant and a drudg to thy paſſion, God muſt be call'd to help the venting of thy paſſion: Oh! remember this you that have been at Sea, and have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and things not going according to your mind, have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a curſing, and wiſhing ſuch and ſuch evils might come upon thoſe you are angrie with; that's a kind of prayer, but it's a moſt fearful taking the Name of God in vain in the higheſt degree: and certainlie God will not hold him guiltleſs that ſhall ſo take his Name in vain; therefore be humbled for this ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>Do not we reade in the Book of</hi> Pſalms, <hi>where many times the Prophet</hi> David <hi>doth curſe the Enemies of God, and wiſhes evil to come upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer. Firſt, That the Prophet, and thoſe that pen'd the <hi>Pſalms</hi> they had a prophetical ſpirit; and thoſe places that you reade that are in a way of curſing, they are rather prophetical predictions of evil, than direful imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they are rather fore-telling what ſhall be in a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, than wiſhing what ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If they be wiſhing what ſhould be, then I anſwer That thoſe which were endued with ſuch a prophetical ſpirit, they did know who were the implacable enemies of God, and who were not; as <hi>David</hi> praied againſt <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeers before he was born: by a prophetical ſpirit he knew that he was the child of perdition; indeed, if we could certainly know a man that were to be a caſt-away eternallie from God, it were another matter: As the Church in the time of <hi>Julian,</hi> becauſe of his Apoſtaſie being ſo abominable, it was determined almoſt generally by them, that he had committed the ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, and upon that they curſ'd him. Now I ſay, thoſe that had an extraordinarie ſpirit, that did know who theſe were, they might do it; but this is no example
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:104284:121"/>
for us in an ordinarie way to wiſh evil and curſes upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But thus far we may do with the Enemies of the Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We may curſe them disjunctively, Lord either take them out of the way, or keep them that they may not do ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in the Church: or thus, conditionally, If thou ſeeſt Lord that they be implacable, thou knoweſt them, if ſo, let thy wrath and curſe purſue them; Lord, thou ſeeſt what evil they are ſet upon, and therefore rather than they ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their miſchievous deſigns, let thy wrath and curſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them: ſo we may do it, but not abſolutely to curſe any, though they ſhould do us never ſo much wrong, we are called to bleſſing: But now in zeal to God, take heed that we be not carried on in our own paſſion; but being ſure it is zeal to God, we may wiſh the curſes of God to purſue thoſe that God knows to be implacable; this is but an appealing to God, and not at all faſtning it upon any particular perſons that we know, but leaving it unto God for the execution of it, and ſo in a zeal to the Glory of God, we may do it, and we are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted ſo to do by the ſecond Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdom come:</hi> for that Petition that requires us to pray for the coming of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, doth alſo require that we ſhould pray againſt all means that hinder the coming of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that every time that the Church praies, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> or any praies, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> they do as much as ſay, O Lord, Do thou ſet thy ſelf againſt all the Enemies of thy Kingdom; if they belong to thy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Lord convert them, but otherwiſe Lord confound them. Now thus we ſee how we are to ſanctifie the Name of God in Prayer, in regard of the Matter of the Prayer; but now for the Manner of Prayer. The moſt things I confeſs are there.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When we come to prayer, we muſt be ſure to pray with underſtanding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>What is it then? I will pray with the Spirit, and will pray with underſtanding alſo,</hi> God doth not love the Sacrifice of fools; we muſt not come babling to God in prayer to ſpeak we know not what, and to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply words we know not wherefore, but God doth require
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:104284:121"/>
that thoſe that come to prayer, come with underſtanding, that they offer to God a rational, a reaſonable, an underſtanding ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; God is a Spirit, and he will be worſhiped in Spirit and in Truth; now as it belongs to all other duties of Worſhip, ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in prayer, to know what we do when we pray, not to think to put off God with a meer emptie ſound; that's the firſt thing.</p>
               <p>The Second thing in the manner of Prayer, it is, The giving up all the faculties of our ſouls in it; I ſpake to that in the Worſhip of God in general, we ſhall apply it now particularly to prayer, the giving up, not only our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, but wills, thoughts, affections, ſtrength in prayer: in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 3. it is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> that he <hi>ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſeek the Lord,</hi> he did give his whol ſelf to ſeek the Lord: we are to give our whol ſelf, and not to divide in Prayer. Now this were an argument that indeed might well take up a whol Sermon, in ſhewing the evil of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of our ſpirits in prayer; we ſhould take heed of the wandering of our ſpirits in the hearing of the Word, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacraments, and ſo in prayer; the people of God are much troubled with the wandering of their thoughts both in Word and Sacrament, and it is their great burden, and ſhould be ſo, but I never hear any more complainings of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of their ſpirits than in the time of prayer, the people of God are much peſtered in their ſpirits with this evil, it is very grievous unto them, and many of them go under it as a grievous burden all their daies; the chiefeſt burden that is upon their ſpirits is their wandering in prayer; ſo that if God ſhould ſpeak to them as he ſpake unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> and bade him ask what he ſhould give him, I verily beleeve there are many in this Congregation, that have already good aſſurance of Gods love in Chriſt, if they had not that, that would be the main thing that they would ask, but having attained that, if God would ſpeak from Heaven and ſay, What ſhall I give you for your ſelves, if he ſhould ask you in the general, it may be you would ask ſomething for the Churches; but if it be for your ſelves, you would put up this Petition, Oh Lord, that I may be delivered from a wandring ſpirit in holy
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:104284:122"/>
duties, and eſpecially in the dutie of Prayer, that I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by come to enjoy more holy communion with thy ſelf than ever yet I enjoied, and they would account this to be a greater mercie than if God ſhould give them to be Kings or Queens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whol world; if God ſhould put theſe two into the ballance, Either the whol world to poſſeſs, or otherwiſe to have more free hearts in coming to God in prayer, and to be delivered from that which hath ſo much hindred ther Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in prayer, they would deſpiſe and ſcorn the world in compariſon of ſuch a mercie as this is: howſoever carnal hearts they think little of it, but thoſe that are the Servants of God, they find it to be very grievous to them; but being the time is paſt, I ſhall reſerve that to ſpeak yet a little more largely for the help of thoſe that are under the burden of it.</p>
               <p>I'le only ſpeak one thing further now, and that ſhall be to thoſe that are wicked and vile, and not only have vain wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts in prayer, but even in the very dutie of prayer manie times have wicked and ungodly thoughts; how horrible are they? unclean thoughts, murderous thoughts it may be, and moſt abominable. I confeſs even thoſe which are godlie may ſomtimes have ſome blaſphemous thoughts caſt into them, for the Devil is never more buſie than at the time of prayer; but they rather come from the Devil than from the ſtream and corruption of their own hearts, which may be we may make out more cleerlie afterward; but now I ſpeak to ſuch as have moſt wicked abominable thoughts, riſing from the ſtream and corruption of their hearts, ſuch thoughts as their hearts do cloſe withal in prayer, and they can roll thoſe thoughts about in their minds as a Child will roll a piece of Sugar in its mouth; and this is the wickedneſs of manie men and womens hearts.</p>
               <p>Take but this one Note with you, That all thoſe dreadful, vile, unclean, covetous thoughts of thine in Prayer, they have been to God as if you had ſpoken them in words; thoughts to God, are all one with him as words are to men; for God is a Spirit, and the Spirit doth converſe with God in thoughts, as well as men do converſe with men in words; and what a
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:104284:122"/>
woful guiltines would have been upon you, had you ſpoken ſuch vile and wicked things to men as ſomtimes hath been in your minds even when you have been praying to God, how would the company have even ſpit in your faces, and kick'd you from them? none that have any face of godlineſs would have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you in their company; and yet here's the evil of it, your hearts are not troubled, but you riſe off your knees and away you go; thou haſt a cauteriſed conſcience, a ſeared conſcience, that canſt entertain ſuch vile thoughts at any time without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy ſpirit afflicted, and going away with ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as if the greateſt evil had befallen thee; therefore take heed of this.</p>

            <p>Firſt, That we muſt pray with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandining. Secondly, we muſt give up our ſelves to Prayer.

'Tis true, the beſt of us al will have vain thoughts ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; but yet as one compares the vain thoughts of men in paryer, like to a Spaniel that goes out with a man, he walkes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps but half a mile, but the Spaniel will be runing up and down this way and that way, and if all the ſpace of ground which the Spaniel hath gone over ſhould me meaſured, it may be while you are walking half a mile, the Spaniel fetching compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes here and there would be halfe a dozen miles; ſo our fances are like a Spaniel which will have fetches about this way and that way in a thouſand vain thoughts; but thus now it is with a godly man; as a Spaniel though running from his maſter, yet if he give him a call; he is able to call him to him preſently; and it were well if it were ſo with us, though our fances be wild, yet if we were able to call in our fances, and to have them at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it were well with us: And I find very much, that thoſe that are new comers they complane much of the vanity of their thoughts, they were wount to pray before, and they never had ſuch vane thoughts as now they have; the reaſon why there is ſo much vanity of thoughts, or at leaſt ſo much taken notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:104284:123"/>
It is firſt, becauſe there is but a little grace in the midſt of a great deal of corruption in yong converts, like a ſpark of fire in the midſt of a great deal of aſhes; now if there lies a heap of aſhes and nothing elſe, you do not ſtir them; but if there be aſhes and ſome fire, then you will ſtir them and be blowing thoſe ſparks to kindle another fire by. Now when you come to make any motion, then the aſhes wil flie about, wheras before they lay ſtill; So it is here, before God wrought upon thy heart, there was nothing elſe but aſhes upon thy ſoul, and then they lay ſtill, but now God hath kindled ſome ſparks of grace in thy heart, and God is blowing them up to a greater heat, and is bringing of them to a flame; upon this motion that is in thy heart, and the ſtirring to kindle thoſe ſparks further in thy heart, it is that the aſhes of thy corruption do as it were flie about thine ears, and that there is ſuch ſtirrings of corruption more than there was before, 'tis not becauſe there is more corruption than there was formerly, but before there being nothing elſe but corruption it lay ſtill, and now becauſe there is ſomething elſe, therefore it is that corruption doth ſo ſtir; and beſides, you know a man that was wont to keep lewd company, if God turn him that he will keep that company no more, at firſt he ſhall be more troubled with them than he was before; and they will keep oftener knocking at his door, and laboring to get him to them again; ſo 'tis here, when the ſoul, vanity and luſts were as friends together there was no diſturbance, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of any thing then, but now when the ſoul is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out thoſe ſinful diſtempers, and will have no more of them, they for the preſent will be more importunate, active and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring than they were before. And beſides, the Lord doth this to humble thy heart the more, that thereby thou mayeſt come to ſee the great corruption that was in thy ſoul before; the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of thy corruptions will diſcover much evil in thy heart, that thou didſt not think was there before; when the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men and women lie ſtill, they think there is no ſuch thing in their ſouls; as your civil men, what's the reaſon that they bleſs themſelves and think they are in a good condition, it's becauſe their corruptions lie ſtill in them and do not ſtir, they cannot beleeve what abundance of wickedneſs there is
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:104284:124"/>
in their hearts, if God ſhould open the wickedneſs that there is in the hearts of men naturally, and ſo all unregenerate men they would think you ſpake ſtrange riddles, whereas they bleſs themſelves; they bleſs God, they know no ſuch thing in their hearts, No? yes, there are ſuch things, only they are not ſtir'd, but they lie quiet; as mud in the bottom of a pond, there it is, yet you cannot ſee it till it be ſtir'd: at firſt converſion (I ſay) the Lord ſuffers thy corruption thus to ſtir, that he may diſcover to thee what an evil heart thou haſt, what abundance of ſin there is in thy heart, and therefore your yong converts, they look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves as more loathſom and vile than ever they thought they had been.</p>
            <p>And beſides, The Devil ſees it a vain thing to tempt a yong Convert to any groſs act of ſin; when conſcience hath life and power in it, he ſhall never prevail that way; but now he thinks he may prevail to diſturb them with vain thoughts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he laies his ſtrength moſt that way; therefore let not ſuch be diſcouraged, that find their ſpirits anoyed and peſtred with them, if they make them to be the burden of their ſouls; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding much vanity of thoughts, the Lord will accept of any deſire that they have to ſanctifie his Name in holy Duties; And I ſhal give you theſe three or four Rules to help you againſt theſe wandring and vain thoughts in holy Duties, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Prayer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When thou goeſt to prayer, account it to be a great work; ſet a high price upon thy prayer; not as having any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in it as it comes from thee, but ſet an high price upon it as a great Ordinance of God, wherein there is communion with God to be enjoyed, and the influence of the grace of God to be conveyed through it; ſo ſet an high price upon prayer, at every time thou art going to prayer; Lord, I am now ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon a work that is of very great conſequence, and much lies upon it, and I would account it to be a ſore and a great evil to me, if I ſhould loſe but this prayer: this would be a ſpecial means to compoſe thy ſpirit, and to keep thee from wandring; as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6. 3. a place which I have ſometimes quoted upon ſuch an occaſion; when the enemies of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> that would hinder the building of the Temple, ſent
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:104284:124"/>
to him that they might talk together, no ſaith he; I am doing a great work to that I cannot come down; ſo when the Devil and the vanity of thine own heart, would ſend to thee to parly, and talk as it were with thee, give an anſwer, I cannot ſtand parlying with theſe things; the work that I am about is a great work; there are verie few people that do account the work of prayer a great work; if thou didſt, it would help thee much againſt the vanitie of thy thoughts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Every time thou goeſt to prayer, thou that art moſt troubled with ſuch vain thoughts, renew thy reſolutions againſt them; I have been troubled with vain thoughts here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and am afraid, if I look not to it, that I ſhall loſe this Prayer alſo; and therefore O Lord, here I renew my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions to ſet againſt them in this prayer with all my might; it is very much that may be done with ſtrong reſolutions, and eſpecially if thy ſtrong reſolutions be renewed reſolutions; for an old reſolution begins to grow weak; a man that hath reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon a thing a great while ago, it hath little power over him; but now when a man hath reſolved upon a thing but this morning, and juſt at the time when he is going about it, now he doth reſolve upon it, and ſet himſelf upon it, and doth reſolve through the Grace of God, that whatſoever difficultie he meets withal, whatſoever it coſt him, that he will go through this work, I ſay that reſolutions renewed have a great deal of power; and you cannot imagine what a great deal of power the renewing of reſolution againſt vain thoughts will have, if they were renewed everie time thou goeſt to prayer, until thou getteſt power over thy thoughts; do but make trial of this; thou haſt loſt many a prayer by vain thoughts; and thou haſt been troubled for them, and yet they come again; do but trie for this week; as I remember I ſaid in the point of paſſion and anger, that we ſhould reſolve with our ſelves well, whatſoever falls out this morning, I am reſolved I will bear it; ſo bethink thy ſelf how many Prayers thou haſt loſt by vain thoughts: and now renew thy reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Covenant with God, that for this Prayer, I will ſet my ſelf againſt them, whatſoever pains I take, I will be ſure yet withal to look up to Gods Grace to aſſiſt me, I will
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:104284:125"/>
be ſure this prayer to keep my heart cloſe to what I am about; and perhaps that will help you a little; but yet ſome vain thoughts wil come for all that; then the next night renew them again; and the next morning renew them again; and that till thou comeſt to a habit of keeping thy heart cloſe to the dutie, though now thou feeleſt thy heart ſo wild, that thou thinkeſt it is impoſſible to bring it into order, but certainly by ſuch a means thy heart will be brought into order.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Be ſure to ſet the preſence of God before you in prayer; have a real ſight of the infinite Greatneſs, Majeſtie, and Glorie of that you preſent your ſelves unto, when you are calling upon him; if ſo be that thou canſt be a real ſight of God in his Glorie, it will keep thy heart cloſe to the dutie, as if a man be wandring with his eyes, and looking after everie fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the King or ſome great perſon come into the room, all his thoughts would be about the King, or the great perſon that were coming in: ſo if you would preſent the Lord in his Glorie and Greatneſs, Excellencie, Majeſtie, and Power, before you, and what a dreadful God he is in himſelf, and yet what a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God he is to us in his Son: this would mightily compoſe our hearts; certainly men and women that are ſo wandring in their prayers, it is becauſe their eyes are not open to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in his Glorie, they are as it were dreaming and do not apprehend that God ſtands and looks upon them, and obſerves them, and that God takes notice of everie wandring thought that comes from them; they do not conſider that God doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the thoughts of men, as well as men do with the words of men: that's the third Rule.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Take heed thou beeſt not deceived; becauſe that thoſe thoughts thou haſt in prayer, do not appear to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie evil in themſelves. This is a great deceit and hinders ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the ſanctifying of Gods Name in Prayer; there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times darted in ſome vain thoughts; now becauſe the thought hath no great evil in it ſelf, therefore they think they may play with it, and their hearts cloſe with it, and ſo run along with it as the fiſh doth with the bait; if the Devil caſts in a thought of blaſphemie, that makes thee quake and ſhake; but if thy thoughts have no great evil in them, but they are ſlight
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:104284:125"/>
things; matters of no moment one way or other, upon that thy heart begins to be dandling, and playing with them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember this Rule, That in the time of prayer, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thoughts be in thy mind that do not concern the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dutie, they are ſinful before God, though the thoughts for the matter of them be never ſo good, yet thou art to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them as ſinful at that time. Therefore never be deceived with this, that the thoughts are not verie ſinful: that's another Rule.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, obſerve this Rule, If ever God hath helped thee at any time in prayer, that thy heart hath been kept cloſe to a dutie, and thou haſt had communion with him, bleſs God for that, bleſs God for that help; 'tis a Rule of verie great uſe for us to get further aſſiſtance from God in any thing, if ſo be our hearts be enlarged to bleſs God for any aſſiſtance we have had heretofore; and the reaſon why we gain and proſper ſo little in our Chriſtian courſe, it is becauſe we do not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of what God hath done for us, to give God glorie for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies formerly received, and therefore God takes little or no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in coming in with further mercies to us: as if you had a yong Nurſerie of Trees, and they began to thrive very well, but there comes a companie of Caterpillars, and ſpoils almoſt all the yong Trees that are ſet, only two or three are kept from the Caterpillars; a man goes into his Orchard, and looks upon his Trees, and this is ſpoiled, and that is ſpoiled; but he ſees two or three, and theſe flouriſh fairly, and theſe are full of Buds, and are like to come to ſomething, and he rejoyces mightily in thoſe, becauſe they are ſav'd when ſo manie others are ſpoil'd: and ſo do thou view thy Prayers, and conſider how many nie hath been ſpoiled as it were by theſe Caterpillars; for I compare wandring vain thoughts in Prayer unto Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that are upon the trees; and we ſee that if ſtormy rainy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comes, the Caterpillars will fall; and one would think that theſe bluſtering ſtorms, and the hand of God that hath been out againſt us ſhould have clenſed our thoughts and ſouls from theſe Caterpillars that have been upon our duties, but manie duties have been ſpoiled; yet thou maieſt ſay, that through Gods mercie ſuch a morning in my cloſet, the Lord
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:104284:126"/>
hath preſerved a prayer to himſelf and I have gotten power over this vain heart of mine; bleſs God for this, and ſo the Spirit of God will be more readie to come in and help thee another time: But thus much ſhall ſuffice to ſpeak to this. That's the ſecond thing, we muſt give up our ſelves wholly to this dutie.</p>
            <p>The third thing for the ſanctifying of Gods Name in Prayer is this, There muſt be the breathings of the Spirit of God, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe Gods Name is not ſanctified; that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. is cleer for this, <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> If any of you ſhould ſay, How can we ſanctifie Gods Name, we are poor and weak, we can do little? Mark, it is ſaid here, That the Spirit helpeth our infirmities to pray; and the word is exceeding emphatical in the original: in your books it is but meerly hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping our infirmities, but the meaning of the word is, <hi>In theſe two things the Spirit helps;</hi> that is, look how a man that is taking up an heavie piece of Timber at one end, he alone cannot get it up, but there comes another, and takes it up at the other end, and ſo helps him: the word ſignifies ſuch a kind of helping, as when a man takes a thing at the other end, or on the other ſide, one ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the one way, and the other ſtanding the other way; or one taking up one end, and the other the other end, that is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it; <hi>he helps our infirmities;</hi> the poor ſoul is pulling and tugging with its own heart, and finds his heart heavie and dull, like a log in a ditch; And have not many of you found your hearts ſo? but now, when you are tugging with your hearts, and would fain lift up your hearts to God in prayer, there comes the Spirit of God at the other end, and takes the heavieſt end of the burden and helps you to lift it up: If a Child were at one end of the log, and that were but light, and the other end very heavie; if one come and take up the heavieſt end, a little ſtrength will ſerve for the lighter end: So the Spirit comes and takes up the heavier end in duty, and ſo helps our infirmities, <hi>helps toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And then the other word is, <hi>The Spirit;</hi> that is, together with the acting of the graces of the Spirit in our hearts, you muſt not ſay ſo; Alas! what can I do? it muſt be the Spirit of God that muſt do it. It's true, he doth all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="291" facs="tcp:104284:126"/>
Firſt, he gives converting and habitual grace, and aſſiſting and actuating grace; but now when the Spirit hath wrought grace ſo as to convert the heart, and hath given habitual grace in thy heart, why then when the Spirit comes to aſſiſt, it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that thou ſhouldeſt ſtir up all the gifts and graces of the Spirit, and the very ſtrength of thy body; the Spirit of God expects that thou ſhouldeſt act to the uttermoſt thou art able, what power hath been given thee by God; and when thou art in acting, then the Spirit comes and helps together with us; noting that we are to put forth what ſtrength we have, and thus Gods Name will be ſanctified, when as we putting forth the graces of the Spirit in us, then the Spirit comes and helps; and what comes from us now comes from the breathings of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in us, and then God who knows the meaning of the Spirit, will know now the meaning of our ſighs and groans; therfore when thou art going to prayer, thou art to eye the Spirit of God; thou art by the eye of faith to look upon the Spirit of God, and to caſt thy ſoul upon the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, thou art to look upon the holy Ghoſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Father and the Son to that Office, to be a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to his poor ſervants in the duties of Worſhip, and eſpecially in that great duty of prayer; now upon the reading of this text, and having it thus opened? this is one good help for thee in prayer; reade this text, and then exerciſe thy faith upon it; Lord haſt thou not ſaid that thy Spirit helps our infirmities, when we know not what we pray for nor how to pray for any thing as we ought; but the Spirit will come, now Lord make good this Word of thine to my ſoul at this time, and let me have the breathings of the Spirit of God in me; alas the breaths of men, if it comes from gifts and parts, I know thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver regard it, except there be the breathings of the holy Ghoſt in me in prayer; now if you would know whether the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth come in or no, you may know it by this; the Spirit of God carries unto God, and it makes the Prayer ſweet and delightful, ſo much of the Spirit of God as is there, it comes to the ſoul in the duty, and it leaves a ſavour behind it; a gracious ſavour is alwaies left behind, when the Spirit of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:104284:127"/>
God comes to breath; O the breath of the Spirit of God is a ſweet breath, and it makes prayers ſweet; it never comes into the ſoul but after it hath done any work it came for, it leaves a ſweet ſcent, after that, the ſoul finds a ſweetneſs in that prayer; now many of you have been in the morning at prayer, but I appeal to you; what ſweet ſavor of the Spirit of God is left behind? certainly if the Spirit hath been there it is like Civit that is put into a little box, though you ſhould take out the Civit, yet there will be a ſweet ſavor left behind; ſo though the Spirit of God, in reſpect of the preſent aſſiſtance, withdraws it ſelf, yet it leaves a ſweet ſavor behind.</p>
            <p>The fourth thing is puritie of heart; pure hearts and hands in <hi>Heb</hi> 10 22. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 8. having every one of them harps, and golden vials ful of odors which are the prayers of Saints; mark, the prayers of Saints are odours in golden vials; the golden vials I may compare to the heart; the hearts of the Saints muſt be as golden vials, and then their prayers will be as odours; in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. the holy Ghoſt giving directions how we ſhould pray, it is with this qualification, I will therefore that men pray eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where lifting up holy handes without wrath and doubting, the outward converſation muſt be pure, and the heart pure; in <hi>Job,</hi> 22. 26. mark what's ſaid concerning that holy man; there's a promiſe made to him for the lifting up of his face to God, putting away iniquitie from his Tabernacle, that by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away evil from our Tabernacles, and from our hearts, we may be able to lift up our hearts with joy to go; and that's the fourth thing, puritie of heart and hands.</p>
            <p>The fift thing is, in truth, when we come to call upon God, we muſt call upon him in truth, <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 145. 18. verſ. the Lord is nigh unto all, to all that call upon him in truth; you will ſay, What is the meaning of that? to that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>
            <p>Firſt, There muſt be inward diſpoſitions anſwerable to the expreſſions; as for inſtance, when I come to expreſs the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Majeſtie of God, then I muſt have an inward diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſutable to this expreſſion, I muſt have a fear and reverence of the infinite Majeſtie of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When I come to confeſs my ſin, to judg my ſelf
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:104284:127"/>
for my ſin, there muſt be an inward diſpoſition ſutable to ſuch a confeſſion; O how many men and women will come and ſpeak great things againſt themſelves for their ſins, and judg them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their ſins, and yet there, is no ſuch diſpoſition in their hearts ſutable to their words; you ſhall have ſome in praying with others, they will be a means to break the hearts of others, they will ſo follow their ſin; and take ſuch ſhame and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon themſelves for their ſin; and yet God knows their hearts not ſtir'd all this while; and then they will call upon God for pardon of ſin, and for power againſt their ſin, and yet God knows that their hearts do cloſe with their ſin, and are loth to part with their ſin in the mean time, this is falſneſs of heart; when the inward diſpoſition is not anſwerable to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward expreſſions; I beſeech you my brethren conſider of the prayers you have made, and eſpecially you that pray much with others, look what expreſſions you have made, and ſee whether there be anſwerable diſpoſitions to the expreſſions you have made, and how that the Lord doth remember every expreſſion that you have made.</p>
            <p>Thirdly We muſt call upon God in truth, that is, Conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to performe the engagements of prayer, prayer puts an engagement upon the heart; now thoſe that call upon him in truth are conſcionable to perform the engagements; as now, do I pray for any good thing? I am engaged to endeavour in the uſe of al means for the attaning of the good thing: When you confeſs a ſin, why, you are engaged by that means to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour all your might againſt that ſin: and when you pray for my grace, you are engaged to make uſe of all means you can for the attaining of that grace; and then beſides, in prayer there is much profeſſion unto God for our ſinceritie and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, and of our willingneſs to be at his diſpoſe, perform theſe engagments that thou makeſt to God in prayer; if God ſhould preſent to us all our profeſſions that We have made to him in prayer, and tell us how we have come ſhort of them, it would make us be in ſhame and confuſion in our own thoughts.</p>
            <p>Another thing in prayer muſt be faith; pray without doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as in the former Scripture, the prayer of faith prevails
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:104284:128"/>
much; <hi>James,</hi> 1. 6 7. a man that wavereth and doubteth muſt not think to obtaine any thing of God. But I ſhould have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened what that faith is that we ſhould have in prayer, we muſt have faith to beleeve that the thing that we do pleaſeth God, and faith in Gods promiſes, and faith in Gods providence, this ſhould be exerciſed in the time of our prayers; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after we have done, to go away beleeving, as <hi>Hannah</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 18. we read of her, that after ſhe had been praying ſhe went away, and lookt no more ſad, the text ſaith; noting that after we have been powring forth our ſouls to God, we ſhould beleeve and exerciſe faith and not go in as drooping a way as ever we did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay, Yea, if we knew certainly that God would hear us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The way to be aſſured that God will hear you, is by caſting your ſelves upon God, how can you know that he will hear, but by reſting upon him? I have been with God, and I have been doing the duty of a poor creature, and for the ſucceſs I leave it to God, and therfore it muſt be with faith.</p>
            <p>But I have ſo many ſins mixt with my prayers, how can I beleeve?</p>
            <p>You have an excellent Scripture for that to help a ſoul, to exerciſe faith in prayer, notwithſtanding there hath been many infirmiities; in <hi>pſal.</hi> 65. 2, 3. <hi>O thou that heareſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, unto thee all fleſh ſhall come;</hi> Thou heareſt prayers, but I haue a great manie ſines that hinders; no, mark what though iniquitie prevails againſt me, as for our tranſgreſſions, thou ſhalt purge them away? Oh make uſe of this Scripture, though you remember not other things; yet you that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected hearts and are afraid that God will not hear your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſee what text ſaith, <hi>Thou heareſt prayer Lord</hi> But will not my ſins hinder? no ſaith <hi>David, Iniquity prevails againſt me, as for our tranſgreſſions thou ſhalt purge them away;</hi> exerciſe faith in this; and know that God doth not hear prayer becauſe thou art not ſinful, becauſe of thy worthyneſs, but meerly for his free grace.</p>
            <p>Another holy diſpoſition in prayer ſhould be this; The ſoul
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:104284:128"/>
ſhould come with a holy freedom, with the Spirit of adoption to God, crying Abba, Father; if thou comeſt to God meerly as to a Judg; though it's true, thoſe that do not know that God loves them, yet bound as creatures to pray, but thou canſt never ſanctifie the Name of God, til thou haſt a child-like Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the ſpirit of adoption; the Lord loves to have his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren come with freedom of Spirit to Himſelf in prayer, to come as Children, and not to come with dejected countenance, and diſcouraged hearts; but come freely to open thy heart to God, as any child would open his heart to a gratious and loving Father.</p>
            <p>Another diſpoſition is fervency in Prayer; the effectual fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer of a righteous man availeth much, and that will be a means to help againſt vain thoughts too; as when the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is ſcalding hot then the flies will not come to it; if thy heart were as it were ſcalding hot in prayer thou wouldeſt not have ſuch vain thoughts,</p>
            <p>Next there muſt be conſtancie in prayer; in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 17. by that I mean this, never to give over until we have that we pray for, or ſomthing elſe in leiu of it; it may be thou heaſt prayed and nothing is come of it; but not diſcouraged thou haſt to deale with a great God, and therefore pray againe and againe, &amp; again, and pray with this reſolution, Well, let God do with me what he will, I will as long as I live call upon Him, and if God ſhall caſt me away, yet he ſhall caſt me away calling upon Him, as the poor woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> when Chriſt called her dog, and diſcouraged her, yet ſtil ſhe will pray; I but Dogs may have crums, that heart is in an ill condition that is diſcouraged in prayer, becauſe it doth not get what he would, and therefore to think themſelves I had as good not pray at all, take heed of any ſuch thoughts.</p>
            <p>Again If you would pray to God indeed, ſo as to ſanctifie his Name in Prayer, there ſhould be humility in your hearts ſo as to be ſenſible of your own unworthyneſs; I ſpake ſomwhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout being ſenſible of the diſtance between God and us, when I ſpake about ſanctifying of Gods name in general. The laſt that I ſhall ſpeak of this is, when you have done all this, all theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications will not ſanctifie Gods Name, except all be tendered
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:104284:129"/>
up in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, and in the power of his merits; let a man or woman pray with as much fervencie, zeal; conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, puritie, in truth and ſinceritie; yet except he puts up all in the Name of Chriſt, I ſay, he cannot be accepted; our ſpiritual offerings muſt be tendered up in His, Name; but I have preached much about that. But now put all that hath been ſaid together, and this it is to pray:</p>
            <p>That is, when as I pray underſtandingly; when I give my ſelf to prayer, when there are the breathings of the holy Ghoſt in my prayer, when there is puritie of heart like a golden vial, together with ſinceritie, when it is in truth of heart, when it is in faith, when it comes from a ſpiritual Adoption, when it is in fervencie, when in conſtancie, reverence, humilitie, and all put up in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt; now a man prayes, as it is ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> Behold he prayeth; ſo I may ſay of thoſe that are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in ths Art, Behold they pray. You ſee now that prayer is more than to reade in a book, more than to ſay a few words; ye ſee it is a verie hard thing to pray, a work of great difficultie, and no marval though we have loſt ſo manie of our prayers as we have done; we muſt not charge Prayer and God with it, but look to our ſelves (I mean not charge the Ordinance of Prayer) but the vileneſs of our carriage in our prayers; and let us for time to come know what a Chriſtian life means. It is ſaid of Chriſt in <hi>Luke:</hi> 9, 29. that, <hi>as he was praying, the faſhion of his countenance was changed.</hi> Oh that, s an excellent thing, that when we have been in our cloſets at prayer, to come away with our faces ſhining; my Brethren could we but pray in ſuch a manner as this is, the very faſhion of our countenances would be changed, as <hi>Moſes</hi> when he came from the preſence of God upon the Mount, or as Chriſt that had the faſhion of His countenances changed. Prayer, it is the ſweet eaſe of ones ſpirit, it's the help at a dead lift, it's the great Ordinance of our Communion with God in this world, and therefore let us learn this Art of ſanctifying Gods Name in prayer.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude all in this, you have heard the myſterie of the ſanctifying the Name of God in worſhiping God; now I beſeech you, you that have been a long time in the School of Chriſt, as it were Apprentices to Chriſt to learn Chriſtianitie; be aſhamed
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:104284:129"/>
that you have underſtood ſo little of this art in ſanctifying the Name of God in Prayer; It is an art and myſterie that you muſt be inſtructed in, and you are not Chriſtians till you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in this, as in an art and myſterie: And that man and woman that ſhall be inſtructed truly in this art and myſterie in ſanctifying Gods Name now in the worſhiping of him, ſuch a man and woman ſhall be to all eternity ſanctifying the Name of God in praiſing of him. There is a time coming when all the Saints muſt be in the preſence of God, and be alwaies praiſing of him, and they ſhall then ſanctifie Gods Name for ever; let us now learn this art of ſanctifying Gods name in praying, that we may eternally ſanctifie his Name in praiſing of him.</p>
