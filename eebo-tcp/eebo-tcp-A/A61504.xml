            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The following sheets, containing for the moſt part, the complaints of your people, againſt your Commiſſioner, doe ſo naturallie addreſſe themſelves to your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, that I could not deny them this inſcription; ſome may poſsiblie endeavour, to render the preſumption more criminall, by cenſuring what is thus offered, by a concealed hand in a publick manner, for a libelling pamphlet: And truelie I am ſorrie, that the mere iniquitie of the objectors, should force upon it ſo much of a diſloyall reſemblance; but ſieng that it advanceth nothing, which I might not avowedlie preſent to your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, on your throne, and environed with both your Par<hi rend="sup">lts.</hi>, nd athere own and Iuſtifie, in every point; I am hopefull, that the truth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of what is here honeſtlie held forth, for your own and your kingdoms good, and not the partialitie of any whoſe intereſt it is to have abuſes covered, shall incline you to a more favourable reflexion. I muſt alſo tell your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> that after the endeavours, that have been uſed, to inform in the more dutifull methods, what appears leſſe civill in this (that may be thought too communicative) is nevertheleſſe excuſed by a very loyall expediencie; for allbeit your Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> goodneſſe, be indeed the great comfort and hope of

However as I am ſure, that a ſucceſſe in this eſſay, ſuitable to the ſinceritie of the affection whence it flowes, is the moſt dutifull wish that any heart is capable of; ſo, that your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> may be conſtantlie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to thoſe counſels and courſes, that may render you the moſt glorious and bliſſed of all Princes, is and shall be ever the fervent prayer of</p>

            <p>When, in the year 1660., it pleaſed God to reſtore his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> to theſe his kingdoms; with how cordiall and univerſall a Joy this bleſſing was welcomed by Scotland, is almoſt ſtill recent in every ones rememberance: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this Joy a meer raptour of paſſion, or its demonſtrations confined to tranſient expreſſions; if his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> had done all for himſelfe and us, which God did for both, the reall and ſolid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of our acknowledgement could hardlie have been more large. I shall not at preſent deſcend to a full enumeration of inſtances, the whole tenour of the greateſt part of the Acts, paſt in Par<hi rend="sup">lt</hi> in the years 61. and 62., doe make but one entire evidence; yet there are a few things which doe well deſerve a more particular obſervation.</p>
            <p>As firſt, that upon occaſion of our former troubles, and as if their cauſe and riſe had only been from the peoples mutinie, takeing advantage of the defects or neglects of the regall power, that might have prevented it; We did eſtablish, both by Acts, oaths, and ſubſcriptions, his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> prerogative, to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and incontrollable, in the choice of all Officers of State, Councellors and Judges, and in and over all matters of peace, warr, leagues, bonds, meetings, conventions and Parliaments, with a diſtinct excluſion of all exceptions. It is true, that many did even then thinke this a ſtreatch beyond what the frailties of men, and caſualities of human affairs, can reaſonablie allow, and that it is no leſſe wisdom, to vaile the ſacred heights of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie under the ſhreine of an uncontroverted ſuppoſall; then to expoſe them, by perremptorie determinations, to the cavillings of irreſiſtible exigencies; and therefor did preferr the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Anceſtors, who notwithsſtanding the frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of many more violent provocations, yet did ever leave theſe points, in that fair indefinitneſſe, which dutie doth allwayes conſtrue to an univerſalitie, without interfeiring with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of neceſſitie: But heavens extraordinarie favour, did at that time ſo ſecond the conſtancie of our love to a Prince ſo long wished for, that our great perſuaſions of his ſingular enduements, without any regard to the peeviſh cautions of ſcrupulous pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, were the only meaſures of our conceſſions, and therefor</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, our loyaltie did not here ſubſiſt, but notwithſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:66384:5"/>
that the foundeſt policie hath allwayes judged, <hi>the power in the Prince and purſe with the people</hi> to be the juſteſt ballance of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet we, forgetting all preceeding diſtreſſes, to teſtifie the aboundance of our affection by the rareſt indication whereof our Nation is capable, doe francklie add to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> revennue, above the double of what he formerlie poſſeſſed; and doe netly grant him, by a voluntarie eſtabliſhment, more, I am perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then ever his benigne diſpoſition would have exacted, upon an abſolute ſurrender: And indeed this, our liberall offer, was, at that time, ſo rightlie eſteemed the utmoſt of our abilitie, that, amongſt other motives mentioned in the Act of Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſelie ſett down, <hi>That his Majeſtie had ſignified his reſolution not to raiſe any more Seſs</hi>; and yet how often, ſince that time, our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence hath by Commiſſioners been drawn forth, beyond our power, upon pretext of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> occaſions; the taxations and aſſeſſements that have been impoſed on us, within theſe few years, doe planlie witneſſe, But</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, ſo exuberant were the propenſions of our hearts toward his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, that, as if all this ſubjection profeſſed and liberalitie offered, had been farr ſhort of dutie, we further, by an Act entituled, <hi>An humble tender to his ſacred Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> of the dutie and loyaltie of his antient kingdom of Scotland,</hi> mancipat our very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and perſons to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> devotion and ſervice; and <hi>doe</hi> thereby <hi>in acknowledgment of our dutie, make humble and heartie offer to him of</hi> 20000. <hi>footmen and</hi> 2000. <hi>horſemen, ſufficientlie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and furnished with fourtie dayes proviſion, to be in readineſſe upon his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> call,</hi> for the ends there mentioned: And by the ſame Act <hi>the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> doth declare, that if his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> should have further uſe of their ſervice, the kingdom would be readie; every man betwixt ſixtie and ſixteen, to join and hazard their lives and fortunes, as they shall be called for by his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, for the ſafetie and preſervation of his ſacred perſon, authoritie, and government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly, That there might be nothing wanting to theſe ample expreſſions of our loyaltie, the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> by another Act, <hi>in dutifull and humble recognizance of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> prerogative royall, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the ordering and diſpoſeall of Trade with forraigne nations, and the laying of reſtraints and impoſitions upon forraigne imported commodities, doe belong to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> and his ſucceſsors, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb facs="tcp:66384:5"/>
priviledge and prerogative of the Crown, and that therefor they may doe therein as they shall judge fit for the good of the kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thlie, That it might appear to the world, that we placed the ſecuritie of all our intereſts, more in our confidence of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> goodnes, then upon the firmeſt proviſion of the beſt laws; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> 1641. was held by his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> Father of glorious memorie preſent in perſon, and many Acts were there paſſed and ſuperſcribed by him, for the ſetling of our religion, and liberties, with all the maturitie of judgement, that long and well weighed experience, many and well mannaged treaties, and Englands mediation, could furniſh; Yet, becauſe their luſtre ſeemed to be a litle ſtained, by the ingratefull remembrance of ſome previous contentions, wherein it was our misfortune to have his late Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> differing from us, we, at one blow, annull that Par<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other reaſon or diſtinction reſcind all its proceedings.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly and laſtly, That, for to evidence our unparalelled ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and reſignation unto his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. pleaſure, and <hi>how that,</hi> according to the uſuall phraſe of that time, <hi>all that was deareſt to us was to him ſurrendered</hi>; notwithſtanding, that the Nation ſince its firſt reformation from Poprie, had almoſt continuallie oppoſed Prelacie, and after haveing ejected it, with the ſevereſt excluſions, had for many years enjoyed a Church-conſtitution and miniſtrie, which at leaſt was highlie commendable, for its advanceing of true knowledge and pietie, and in the worſt of times did prove the ſureſt bullworke of Monarchie: Yet, out of meer complyance with his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> will, our Par<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>
               </hi> doth conſent and the people ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie acquieſce, to Presbyteries unexſpected overthrow, and Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies reeſtabliſhment; not that the ruines of what the moſt part did eſteem to be the labour of their Fathers, and worke of God, were at that time unconcernedlie regarded, or the conſequences of this alteration, which have ſince enſued, in the leaſt unforſeen; but in a word, to a King ſo acceptable to us, and to whom we had alreadie given all things, we could refuſe nothing.</p>
            <p>Theſe and other arguments, that then occurred, of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and ſatisfaction of our joy, for his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> return, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I thinke that paſſage Pſ. 126., was not of old more truelie ſaid by thoſe concerned, then vve may now directlie and without paraphraſe transferr it to our ſelves, viz <hi>That when the Lord turned

            <p>The Earle of Midleton was firſt honoured, with his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> Commiſſion, ad did therein beſtirr himſelfe very vigorouſlie, but overhaſtning, and overpryſeing his worke, he ſoon rendered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe obnoxious; ſo that upon the mutuall jealouſies betwixt him and the Duke, then Earle, of Lauderdaill, the Earle of Midleton, in his paſſion miſtakeing the method of <hi>billetting,</hi> for that of <hi>open</hi> voteing, and in a more juſtifiable <hi>preſentment,</hi> then righteous judgement, cauſing My L<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Lauderdaill to be ſentenced incapable of publick truſt; Lauderdaill getteth the advantage; and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at Court, by a baſe inſinuation of Earle Midletons gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſdain of his unworthie practices, in a short time he prevails to Midletons overthrow, and, as the courſe leſſe invidious, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Commiſſion to be transferred to the Earle of Rotheſſe, whom he accompanies, from Court to this kingdom, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeing thatar P<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>

            <p>And in this laſt Seſſion thereof it vvas, that the Act and humble tender above mentioned, vvas paſſed vvith that exorbitant clauſe, offering the forces therein condeſcended on, to <hi>be in readineſſe, as they shall be called for by his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, to march to any part of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Scotland, England, or Ireland, for ſuppreſſing of any forraign invaſion, intestin trouble, or inſurrection, or for any other ſervice, wherein his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> honour, authoritie, or greatneſſe may be concerned.</hi> Which, though at that time it was lookt upon, by ſome, as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſlie expreſſe, and ſuſpiciouſlie diſtinct (a generall offer, being a more aggrieable ſignification of dutie, and a limitation to Scotland, more proper to a Parliaments prudence) Yet the ſtile and humour of thoſe times, did eaſilie exempt it from particular notice: But what My L<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Lauderdaill, its principall contryver, did thereby intend, time, the beſt revealer of ſecret deſignes, hath ſince ſufficientlie diſcovered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:66384:6"/>This Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> being diſſolved, our new triumphant Church (a qualitie, which no Church on earth, did ever evenlie bear) came next upon the ſtage, and being fullie authoriſed by the laws latelie made, and then alſo armed with their <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> they go on, in the years 1664. 65. and 66. with their <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>important conformitie,</hi> at ſo <hi>chriſtian</hi> a rate, that I verily believe, that all men, except a few of our laborious and indefatigable ghoſtlie fathers, were perfectlie thereby tyred out: what prancks were plaid, tumults excited, and tragedies acted, in theſe years, by our reverend Clergie, as if aemulous of that Presbyterian zeal, which they uſe ſo hotlie to decry, needs not here be repeated: My L<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Lauderdaill himſelfe, though at that time our ſole Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, was, in appearance, ſo overcome, and born down by them, to a deſperate indifferencie, that, in probabilitie, if the Earle of Tweddell and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Robert Murray, had not come in for his admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and our reliefe, the land might have been reduced to the greateſt extremities.</p>
            <p>But they, having then the honour of his favour, and thereby, acceſſe to repreſent things in their true ſtate, became the happie inſtruments of a very ſeaſonable deliverance, and afterwards of a more expedient indulgence; whereby the Countrey was very ſenſiblie refreſhed, and a great part of its diſquiets compoſed: And this was the condition of our affairs, when unluckilie, in the year 1669. My L<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Lauderdaill, falling into an itch of <hi>Grace,</hi> and thirſting for a little of that <hi>Glory,</hi> whereof he had long ſwayed the <hi>Power,</hi> procures a new Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> to be called, and himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to named Commiſſioner: Now, it being from the date of this Commiſſion, that we may trulie calculate the riſe of moſt of our late miſchiefs, it will not be amiſſe, that, in the firſt place, I ſummarylie runn over the occaſion, and continuing of this Par<hi>
                  <hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>
               </hi> and thereby make way to their more cohaerent repreſentation; &amp;, it is notoriouſly known, that, the pretence made for its aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, was the notion of an Union betwixt the two Kingdoms; but the matter being of great moment, our procedure muſt alſo be very flow paced, and therefore, during all the firſt Seſſion, which continued from the 19. of Oct<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> unto the 23. of Dec<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>, all done about it was onely the Parliaments anſwer to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66384:7"/>
But the truth is, the honour, power, and profit of the place of Kings Commiſſioner, being once taſted, did prove by farr the more tempting; and therefore the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> muſt be continued, for proſecution of the thing, in a ſecond Seſſion, which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglie held, from the 28. of July unto the 22. of Aguſt 1670, and therein the Commiſſion for the treatie, is, in litle more than an hour, expedited to ſuch perſons, as it ſhould pleaſe his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, or rather My L<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Lauderdaill to ſuggeſt; But, allbeit that, within a very ſhort ſpace thereafter, this whole project was marred, and its deſign diſſipated like a vapour; yet our Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> and his Graces Commiſſion were ſtill kept current, untill that very happilie the warr, which he had helped to bring on, gives him a new colour, for a third Seſſion in the Year 1672. and thereby, occaſion to honour us, with a third viſit. At the opening of this Seſſion, his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> letters are read, intimating the warr to be the cauſe of their meeting; but withall ſtuffed, with ſuch hyperbolicall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of My L<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> Commiſſioners Grace, that I am chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to think, that neither his preſumption vvould have ſerved him to move his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> to ſuch things, nor, even his modeſtie have conſented, that the like ſhould be ſaid of him, if it had not been a deſigned gallantrie for his new amiable Dutcheſſe, who, by a novell practice, had her place prepared, and was there preſent: and certainlie it is to the ſame reaſon, that we muſt aſcribe his breaking up of this Seſſion in the midle, for leading of her Grace, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> about the Countrey, for ſeverall weeks; the members of Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, being left to attend their return: &amp; ſo after the cloſe of this Seſſion, which did dure from the 12. of June unto the 19. of Septr., he goes back again to Court, without any mention of a diſſolution; which nevertheleſſe in his particular, happened well: for finding that matters in England begun to frown, and that in the ſummer 1673, the clouds thickned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedinglie, even to the threatning of an inevitable eruption, at the enſueing meeting or their Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>; If Scotland, formerlie the theatre of his glory, had not novv preſented, as a convenient retreat, he might have been in great perplexitie: and therefore, for a fourth time, dovvn he muſt come, onely the pretence vvas not ſo obvious, yet the vvarr not ended, and the diſorders of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66384:7"/>
Phanaticks, that have ſerved many a turn, are judged ſufficient matter for a letter, wherein his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> recommending firſt the ſecuritie of the kingdom, and next, the ſevere chaſtiſement of non-conforming diſorders, concludes with many good words in behalf of his Grace in the uſuall manner: but the 12. of No<hi rend="sup">vr.</hi> the day of the meeting of Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> being come, after the reading of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> letter, and a ſhort ſpeech made by the Commiſſioner, he is greatly ſurprized, to hear a diſcourſe of grievances begun by Duke Hamiltoun, and ſeconded vehemently from every quarter, ſo that he had no way to extricate himſelf; but by a ſhort ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment: and thus, from that day to the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of Dec<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, keeping only five meetings or Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, he, on the one hand, endeavours by redreſſing the grievances of the Salt, Brandy and Tobacco, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balling with his few adhaerers, and inſinuating with ſome of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſits, to appeaſe matters; and, on the other, he fights and wreſtles, with pretences of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> prerogative, and abrupt adjournments, to ſtave off more touching complaints; untill, perceiving all his ground to be loſt, he is at length neceſſitated to deliver himſelfe by one long adjournment for all, and to wait for a more favourable opportunitie, from the iſſue of things then in dependence in England: but notwithſtanding, that all things, both at Court, and concerning the Engliſh Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to his very wiſh, and that in this <hi>interim,</hi> he hath omitted nothing at home or abroad, which might diſpoſe affairs to a more propitious aſpect; yet when the meeting of our Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> recurrs, on the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. of March, he again, by his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> expreſſe command, <hi>chuſes</hi> to adjourn it unto the 14. of Oct<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> next, to the unexpreſſible ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and diſſatisfaction of both Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> and people.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſpatched the narrative of our Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> and its Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; for the better underſtanding of the cauſes, that have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned our diſcontents, and increaſed them unto the preſent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, it may be remembred, that, after that the Earle of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton was laid aſide, the whole mannagement of our affairs, at Court, was devolved upon My Lo. Laud., as ſole Secretarie, for this kingdom, neither can it be accounted an impoſing, by any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſon, to affirm, that he did no leſſe abſolutelie exerciſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:66384:8"/>His Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> long abſence from our Countrey, and his neceſſarie unacquaintedneſſe, by reaſon thereof, both with perſons and the condition of matters amongſt us, do certainlie extend, and raiſe this employment to the greateſt and higheſt truſt: But My Lo. Lauderdaill, according to his <hi>noble ſelfe confidence,</hi> apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more the controul of other mens officious medlings, than the leaſt poſſibilitie of his own miſtaking, did further improve the thing, by the particular care and caution that he took, to have himſelfe his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> 
               <hi>ſole Informer</hi> as well as his <hi>ſole Secretarie</hi>; and therefore, not onely upon the pretence of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, were our matters, for the moſt part, diſpoſed of above, without any previous advice of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Councell in Scotland; but ſtrict notice was alſo taken of all Scotchmen coming to Court; and to attempt an addreſſe, or acceſſe to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, otherwiſe then by My Lo. Lauderdaill, was, no leſſe, than the hazard of his implacable reſentment. I need not here mention his ſupine, or rather deſigned, neglect of introduceing Scotchmen to offices about Court; it is obvious to every one, that even thoſe vacancies, happening by the death of Scotchmen, were there, through his fault, diſcontinued from the nation: it was alſo his ſtudie and work, as he hath often publicklie boaſted, to have the <hi>Court Councell</hi> for Scotch buſineſſe, upon pretext that it conſiſted of Engliſhmen, diſuſed and ſuppreſſed: But as it is evident, that he did draw to himſelfe the whole ſignificancie of our Nation in England, meerlie for the augmenting of his own value, ſo it is no leſſe clear that he ordered all things amongſt us at his own pleaſure. Thus, from himſelfe alone, Privie Councellors are named, Lords of Seſſion and Exchecquer placed and removed, gifts and penſions granted, Armies levied, and disbanded, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Officers appointed, this Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> called, and all other matters of importance tranſacted, as he thought good to adviſe and direct: And the truth is, that for ſeverall years, the thing was quietlie comported with, foraſmuch as, we did not onely conſider that the preſent ſtate and circumſtances of our government, did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way oblige us to this condition; but did alſo find, that ſo long as Chancellor Hyde did force My Lo. Lauderdaill to conſult, more his prudence, then his humour, his adminiſtration, though too
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66384:8"/>
abſolute, was yet not altogether unreaſonable: But, this reſtraint being once removed, and his ambition left at libertie to ſwell with his proſperitie, what ſtrange and grievous effects it hath ſince produced, eſpeciallie after his riſeing to be his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, the plain hiſtory of things, without the perſwaſions of any other argument, will beſt evince; and becauſe that the order obſerved, or intended in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, will probablie give moſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, it ſhall alſo be the rule of our method.</p>
            <p>The firſt, and great grievance then, mentioned in Parlt., was the monopolie <hi>of the Salt,</hi> which being by My Lo. Lauderdaill procured, to the Earle of Kincaerden his friend, by his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> gift, allowing the praeemption of <hi>Inland</hi> and prohibition <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> ſalt, was worth to the intereſſed more then 4000 <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. yearlie; but not onely with twice as great a diminution of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> revennue, but to the generall and heavie diſtreſſe of the whole countrey; it being moſt certain, that the nation was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reduced to thoſe ſtraits, that in many places, the poor people were neceſſitated, to ſend ſeverall miles to the ſea, for ſalt water, to ſupplie their indigence; and in other places were conſtrained, to give 18. or 20. ſhillings ſt. for the ſame quantitie of ſalt, which, before the granting of this Gift, they uſed to buy for 3 ſh. and 6.<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> or 4. ſh.; ſo that in effect the clamours of the people were ready to break out into uproars and tumults. Which grievance is ſo much the more chargeable upon My Lo. Lauderdaill, becauſe that when his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> chief Officers, perceiving that the firſt deſign of this Salt-project could not take, and that the conſequences of this gift would be very hurtfull, did by their letter give full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to the Court of the prejudices and dangers, likelie to enſue upon it, in ſtead of prevailing, they vvere rather chid and menaced for being ſo officious.</p>
            <p>The ſecond grievance vvas, that of the <hi>Brandy-wine,</hi> vvhich vvas thus occaſioned; in the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> 1663. there was an Act made, prohibiting the importation of ſtrong vvaters, and ſo of brandy-vvine; vvhereupon, in the year 1672., My Lo. Lauderdaill obtains for the L. Elphinſton, vvho had married his Niece, a gift of this prohibition, and of the ſeizures, that ſhould be made upon it; but the contrivance vvas not to render the lavv effectuall,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66384:9"/>
but indeed to circumvene it; for the Patentees advantage; who, in place of hindering the import, did give to the Merchants li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes upon compoſition, at the rate of 15. or 16. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. per tunn, vvhich vvould have amounted to at leaſt 30,00. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. yearlie; and hereby vaſt quanties vvere imported, vvithout the payment of either Cuſtom or Exciſe, and yet vented again in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey at exceſſive prices.</p>
            <p>The third grievance was a gift of 2 ½ d. per pound upon all <hi>tobacco</hi> imported; this gift was granted in the year 1673. to Sr. John Nicolſon for himſelfe and ſome other of My Lo. Lauderdails friends, who were his partakers, whereby they ſhould have made a conſiderable benefit, but with the dammage of, at leaſt, two or three thouſand pounds ſt. yearlie to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> treaſurie, and the great extortion of the people. Theſe were my Lo. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdails wiſe and faithfull improvements of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> prerogative in the matter of Trade, which he was ſo inſtrumentall to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and indeed are perverſions, ſo palpablie groſſe, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring events with their cauſes, a man may find great reaſon to doubt whether My Lo. Lauderdaill did not intend theſe very abuſes, as much in the framing, as in the violating of, theſe laws: and yet when they came to be complained of in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, what oppoſition, and indignation he ſhewed, even to the ſtraining of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> 
               <hi>ſacred authoritie,</hi> in its moſt tender and delicate part, many hundreds can teſtifie; neither can it be alleadged that the things were firſt moved in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, not for a redreſſe from My Lo: Commiſſioner, but in order to A repreſentation deſired to have been made to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> Becauſe that, firſt they being ſo enormous, and yet inſtances onely, and not the whole of our grievances, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation to the king, was not more neceſſarie for an adequate remedie, then for future prevention. Next, the matter of the Salt had been alreadie fullie remonſtrated to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> by his Officers of State, and by My Lo. Laud. procurement, a ſharp rebuke, in ſtead of a gracious reliefe, was all the return, as I have all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie marked. But laſtly, it is moſt probable by all circumſtances, that if it had not been from the fear, and for the diverting of this repreſentation, My Lo. Lauderdaill, in place of hearkning to a redreſſe, had, according to the inflexible conſtancie of his great
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66384:9"/>
ſoul, in the royall ſpirit of Pharaoh, and with the brave Politick of Rehoboams young huffes, anſwered theſe turbulent murmurers, <hi>you are idle, you are idle, your yoke is heavie, but I will add thereto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However neceſſitie, at this time, prevailing, theſe <hi>three burdens</hi> are removed, to the peoples great comfort, and his Majeſties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advantage. But here it is that we are to remark, that the thing wherein his Grace did find himſelfe moſtly concerned, was the propoſall made, as I have touched, that his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> ſhould be by his Parlt. immediatlie informed of the true ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kingdom; and indeed his Grace was thereby ſo hotlie allaram'd, that litle more libertie of ſpeech was allowed, or order obſerved; but immediatlie his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> prerogative is pretended, that nothing ought to be moved in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> except by the Lords of the Articles, that to them complaints and overtures ſhould be firſt made, and, if by their vote thrown out, they ſhould proceed no further, and therefore, not onely were all motions offered in plene Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> checkt and interrupted with this common anſwer, <hi>to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> but the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> was certified by his Grace, that if they ſhould <hi>all</hi> agree to have grievances otherwiſe treated, and conſidered, he would interpoſe and hinder it by his great <hi>negative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, becauſe, that this pretence of the priviledge of the <hi>Lords of the Articles,</hi> was juſtlie lookt upon by all conſidering men, as a virtuall ſubverſion of the power and libertie of Par<hi rend="sup">lts.</hi>, alike pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall, both to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> and the kingdom, it may be obſerved,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that this meeting of the Articles, by its laſt eſtabliſhment, conſiſts of eight Biſhops, choſen by the Lords, eight Lords, choſen by the Biſhops, and eight Commiſſioners of Shires, and eight Burgeſſes, choſen by the eight Prelats, and eight Lords, firſt elected, jointlie to which were added by the Commiſſioner the Officers of State.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That in the contending for the power of this meeting, it was aſſerted, that not onely all buſineſſe muſt be by the Lords of the <hi>Articles,</hi> and by them onely, tabled in Parl<hi rend="sup">t.</hi>, but that, if in the debates upon their reports any new thing ſhould be ſtarted, the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> ought not to take notice of it, further, then to return the whole matter to the meeting of the <hi>Articles,</hi> to be there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained or ſupreſſed at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:66384:10"/>Thirdly, That it is manifeſt from all our Records, that the riſe and conſtitution of this meeting, vvas at firſt by the free ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of our Par<hi rend="sup">lts.</hi>, vvho thought fitt to name certain of their number, for framing ſuch overtures as vvere offered for the publik good, into <hi>Articles</hi> to be enacted for lavvs according to the ancient form; and therefore, it being at firſt deviſed by the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, as a ſimple expedient for order and diſpatch, it vvas alſo, both inconſtant in its being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and variant in its number and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, according as the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> did ſee cauſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That as this meeting was in effect the Committee of the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, for preparing laws; ſo it is very well known, that there was another, more ancient, meeting ordained by the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> and called, <hi>Domini ad querelas</hi> or (if you will) the <hi>Committee of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,</hi> which having continued in all times, was onely diſuſed in the 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> Seſſion of the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> 1661., to the effect that private affairs, which in the firſt Seſſion of that Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, when our ordinarie Courts were not ſet down, had taken too great a current that way, might, after their reſtitution, return more eaſilie to their proper channels.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That the Act of Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> K. I. 6th <hi>appointing four of every Estate, to meet</hi> 20. <hi>days before the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> to receive all articles and ſupplications, and deliver them to the Clerk of Register, to be by him preſented, to the perſons of the Estates, to be conſidered by them, to the effect, that things reaſonable, may be formallie made and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Lords of the Articles, in the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> time, &amp; frivolous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters rejected</hi>; Doth no vvays countenance this exorbitant power of the Lords of the <hi>Articles,</hi> it being manifeſt, by the order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſett down of preparing matters by a previous meeting, and their ſubſequent forming, and preſenting, by the three Eſtates, to the <hi>Articles,</hi> that the Par<hi rend="sup">lts.</hi> povver of firſt receiving, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, matters to that <hi>meeting,</hi> vvas not, at that time, ſo much as the ſubject of the queſtion. But, the onely thing intended, vvas the orderlie tableing of things in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> as is yet further apparent, by vvhat is there ſubjoined viz. <hi>that no Article or ſupplication wanting a ſpeciall title or unſubſcribed by the preſenter ſhall be read or anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered in that Convention</hi> (to vvit of the four of every Eſtate) <hi>or the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> following the ſame.</hi> Which is a proviſion, ſo cleerlie prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorie,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66384:10"/>
to the meeting and vvork of the Lords of the <hi>Articles,</hi> that it is indeed ſtrange, hovv men could have the confidence, to obtrude this Act, even to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, for proveing their pretended prerogative of <hi>the meeting of the Articles</hi> over the Parlt., which, I darre affirm, did never before this time, enter in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either of King or Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> ſince they were knovvn in this nation.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, That in the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> 1663., vvhere My Lo. Laud,<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence vvas very eminent and ſignall, there vvas a particular Act made, <hi>for ſetling the conſtitution and choiſing of Lords of the Articles in all time thereafter</hi> whereby it is expreſslie provided, <hi>that the Lords of the Articles are to proceed, in the diſcharge of their trust, in preparing of Laws, Acts, and overtures, and ordering of all things remitted to them by the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, &amp; in doing every thing elſe, &amp;c.</hi> Which words <hi>remitted to them</hi> do, in their obvious conſtruction, and moſt received ſignification among us, very evidentlie ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and hold forth, the povver, and uſe, of propoſing to be in the body of the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, and that the Lords of the <hi>Articles</hi> are to act upon their references, as their <hi>Committee.</hi>

            <p>Which arguments, being well perpended, and the unanimous ſuffrage of reaſon, law and ſenſe, that doe plainlie ſay, that no Court can or ought to be cypherized by its own delegates, being thereto added; I think I may, without difficultie, affirm, that his Grace by attributing to the <hi>Articles</hi> this praeeminence, and ſuperintendence over the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, and thereby depriving it of its juſt libertie, did directlie impugn, and highlie derogate from its authoritie and dignitie; and ſo became guiltie of a greater griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, then any of thoſe, which he laboured to avoid. Its true he wanted not cogent enough motives, for what he did; he ſaw, in the firſt place, that the meeting of the <hi>Articles,</hi> (whereof he ſuppoſed, that his former care, with the obſequiouſneſſe of the Biſhops, would gain him the pluralitie) was his onely refuge, from the terrour that he became to himſelfe in the apprehenſion, that otherwiſe his actings might come to be <hi>trulie</hi> diſcovered by a <hi>faithfull</hi> Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> to a <hi>gracious</hi> Prince: And next, the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> had, out of their exceeding tenderneſſe of dutie to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, teſtified, in their preceeding ſeſſions, ſo much complyance with all his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> as well as deference to his <hi>character,</hi> that he had fullie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66384:13"/>
aſſured his ambition of their eternall ſubmiſſion; neither was this aſſurance a groundleſſe flatterie, for he knew, that he had put the matter to the proof, upon ſeverall occaſions, as firſt, when upon a vacancie falling out in the meeting of the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> did allow him to ſupplie it by his nomination. 2dly, when contrarie to the received cuſtom (&amp; yet without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction) he cauſed exclude from being preſent at the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Articles,</hi> all ſuch members, as were not thereto named, to the effect, as it is probable, that the body of the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, being leſſe prepared, might the more implicitlie go along withall their concluſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 3dly. vvhen in the 3d. ſeſſion of this Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, upon an overture made by a member, in the debate about the ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuarie act, that the <hi>ſummer ſeſſion</hi> might be taken avvay, he paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natelie bluſtered out, <hi>that, for that very preſumption the thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hould not be done ſo long as he was Commiſſioner,</hi> vvith many other fooliſh words to this effect: Yet in all theſe he was tamelie born with.</p>
            <p>But, albeit theſe things may poſſiblie excuſe his being ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable to free reaſoning, with which he had been ſo litle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; yet it remains ſtill a matter of juſt wonder, that, at leaſt, the intereſt of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> authoritie, viſiblie expoſed by ſuch an intollerable ſtretch, did not oblige him to a better behaviour, in ſo concerning a conteſt: For as much as, it is evident, that if the prudence and loyaltie of the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> had not reſtrained, nothing elſe could have retrived the prerogative, from the inconvenience of this hard <hi>dilemma,</hi> either of being ſubjected to a neceſſarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, or of being the occaſion of a ſeeming breach betwixt the King and his people. But the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, being reſolved to decline that point, with their utmoſt circumſpection, chuſed rather to maintain their poſſeſſion, by an uneaſie exerciſe, then to aſſert their right with the ſmalleſt umbrage of offence, not doubting, but that his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> would, in due time, determin the controverſie to their ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>And therefore, leaving it, as it ſtands, I ſhall again return to my main work, and proſecute our grievances, in ſuch order as the members of Parl<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> found acceſſe to move them in: onely, ſeeing that their endeavours had no better ſucceſſe, than to provoke his Grace to break up this fourth Seſſion, with a two moneths ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66384:13"/>
I ſhall here handle them more fullie then they were there ſpoke to.</p>
            <p>The fourth grievance then is, the <hi>corruption of our Mint and Coinage,</hi> whereof My L. Hatton the D. of Laud<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> brother is Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; this complaint was grounded in the univerſall clamour of the people; vvho have found, for theſe ſeverall years, that the intrinſick value of our ſilver coin is ſenſiblie diminiſhed, both in its vveight and fineneſſe, to the nations great damage, and diſhonour; beſide it doth add to the reſentment, that the ſame L. Hatton having, ſome years ago, filled the Countrey, with a light copper coin, without obſerving, either the quantitie, or the weight and value preſcribed, was nevertheleſſe by My L. Laud<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> means, ſecured and indemnified: It is alſo remembered, that the better to enable him to this depravation of our ſilver coin, the Dutch dollars, called the <hi>legg dollars,</hi> uſuallie imported by our merchants, and current amongſt us at 58.d. per piece, were cryed down by the D. of Laud<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> procurement, to 56.d. for no better reaſon <hi>known,</hi> than that they might be brought in for bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, to the mint-houſe, for his brothers benefit: But though, that all demanded in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> about this matter was, that there might be an examination of the coin appointed, and an account given of the bullion, which hath been long neglected; yet the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall given in for that effect, was not regarded: It is true that My L. Laud., after the Dec<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. adjournment of the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, did move his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> to vvrite a letter, and thereupon bring the buſineſſe to a tryall, before the Councell; but in a manner ſo partiall, that I profeſſe it is my admiration, hovv any man ſhould have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ſtrong enough for ſuch practices. The ſubject of our complaint is the ſtock of our current money, and all appointed by his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> letter, is, that there ſhould be a tryall made upon the <hi>Eſſay boxe,</hi> and the pieces therein contained. I ſhall not ſay, that the overſight thereof hath been altogether in My L. Hattons ovvn povver and truſt theſe years by paſt, yet ſo certain it is, that this <hi>box or pixis</hi> hath been of late ſo greatly neglected, that one of My Lo. Commiſſioners friends, appointed for the examen, could not forbear to ſay, <hi>that they were mett to ſee whether the Officers of the Mint were as much fools as they were ſuſpected to be knaves,</hi> but notvv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tanding this the tryall goes on, and moreover the pieces are not brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

to the <hi>eſſay</hi> ſeverallie, but the whole (with what mixture of fyner pieces coined and conveyed in on purpoſe, to compenſe the baſer, who can tell) is melted down together in one maſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>eſſay</hi> made, and the report thereof, with ſome ſmall lignots, ſent up to the King; which proving (to be ſure) according to the deſigne of the contryvance, his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> within theſe few days, ſends down a ſecond letter to the Councell, ſignifying his ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and willing Hatton and the reſt of the Officers to be exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated: But when this letter is read, it is oppoſed that the grievance of the Mint had been tabled in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, where the tryall ſhould alſo be iſſued, that his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> firſt letter did onely order a tryall to be made of the <hi>eſſay boxe,</hi> which if either falſified, or otherwiſe eluded, could not be a ground of releaſe to the Mint-Officers, ſo long as it was manifeſt, that almoſt the whole of the current coin is defective and debaſed; and laſtly, there was offered, a bagg of money latelie received out of the mint Office, ſealed with the Officers ſeals, which they could not but ſtill acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and it was deſired that there might be a tryall made on the ſpecies therein contained. Notwithſtanding all which, My L. Commiſſioner, and the pluralitie of the Councell, proceed and vote an exoneration, conform to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> laſt letter. Now is not this a noble way of redreſſing grievances, to purge the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and leave the thing untouched? nay to make the greateſt aggravation that can be of his failing, viz. the corrupting or fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating of the checque, the beſt ground of his cleering, and all this contrarie to the reclaiming evidence, of almoſt, as many witneſſes, as there are pieces of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> coin minted in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; it being certain that amongſt hundreds that have been tryed, very few have been reported to be, <hi>ſtandard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth, is <hi>the filling of our Courts of judicatorie eſpeciallie our Seſſion</hi> (which is the ſupream for adminiſtration of juſtice) <hi>with ignorant and inſufficient men:</hi> This is a grievance ſo notorious that I am ſorrie, that it leaves me not ſo much as; the ſhadow of a complement, in forbearing to name the perſons; S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Andrew Ramſey, one of the four latelie brought in by My L. Laud., being queſtioned in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> (as we ſhall hear) did voluntarilie demitt in his Graces hands; and yet I am aſſured that I neither favour
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66384:12"/>
him, nor wrong the other three, when I give him the preference both as to parts and knowledge. But the evill doth not here ſubſiſt; its more afflicting progreſſe is, that in effect My L. Lauderdails all-ſwaying power, his brothers headines, and other mens baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, have introduced that partialitie, both in the Seſſion and other Courts, that, the very foundations of law and right, are like to be ſhaken; as was readie to have been inſtanced in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, in ſeverall late deciſions, prepared for ſeconding the <hi>memoriall</hi> given in for a tryall of this matter: And this was alſo the cauſe of another overture then thought upon, and ſince moved to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, viz. that there ſhould be a methodical digeſtion of our laws, and that the rules of judgement ſhould be rendred more fixed and certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in place of a remedie, theſe things were all adjourned with the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, &amp; ſince their breaking up, new practices have been uſed, to make the caſe more deſperate: For there being, in Februarie laſt a ſentence <hi>interlocuture</hi> pronounced by the Lords of <hi>Seſſion,</hi> in an action betwixt the E. of Dumfermling and L. Amond, the L. Amond, finding himſelfe thereby grieved, thought good to proteſt, and appeal to the King and Par<hi rend="sup">lt</hi>: but My L. Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner looking on this as a noveltie (albeit it wanted not preſidents, and that even his Graces Father, who was himſelfe a Lord of the <hi>Seſſion</hi> did more, in appealing from the <hi>Seſſion</hi> to the King onely) lays hold on the occaſion, and (as its like) as well to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate with the Lords, as to reach ſome Lawyers who had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed him, the Lords are by him moved to write to the King, complaining of the thing, as contrarie to ſeverall Acts of Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, and of dangerous conſequence; to which an anſwer is as quicklie returned, ſignifying his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> diſpleaſure againſt it, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Lords to enquire, by My L. Amond and his Advocates their oaths, who were its contryvers: But when the buſineſſe comes to be examined, My L. Amond owns the Appeal, and adheres to it in the ſenſe wherein his Advocates, by a reſolution under their hands, had affirmed it to be juſtifiable, viz. <hi>that, although by Acts of Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, there did ly no ſuch appeall from the Lords, as could ſtopp their proceedings, or the execution of their ſentences; yet ſeing the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> was the abſolute ſoveraign Court of the kingdom, and hath ſomtimes upon complaint reſcinded the Lords
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66384:11"/>
their decreets, an appeal by way of proteſtation, to relieve the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant of the prejudice of a conſtructive acquieſcence, might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie made from the Lords to the King and Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>
               </hi> and that this they conceived themſelvs bound to aſſert, leſt they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traveen the law, that forbiddeth all men, under the pain of treaſon, to impugn the ſupream authoritie of the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> But albeit both his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Advocate and others of the <hi>Bench</hi> gave their opinion, that an appeal in this ſenſe, is not againſt law, and none of the reſt did or can aſſert the contrarie; Yet My L. Commiſſioner ſtill pouſſeth on, and will have My L. Amonds Advocats to depoſe upon oath, about its contryvance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Advocates do, on the other hand, anſwer as poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivlie, that the appeal being owned by My L. Amond, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by them to be juſtified, there was no more ſubject of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; that his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> letter did ſuppoſe the thing to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and no man was bound, in a matter of that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to give oath againſt himſelfe; that, by an expreſſe law, men ſhould not be required to give oath <hi>ſuper inquirendis</hi>; and laſtly, that by their oath, as Advocates, they were bound not to reveal the ſecrets of their Clients, whereunto the oath demanded ſeemed to tend. And to this laſt point the whole body of the Advocates do Join, and declare their concurrence. But notwithſtanding theſe anſwers, the Lords, refuſing to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Advocates reaſons, write up a ſecond letter, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King with their denyall. In which heats and diſputes, unneceſſarilie drawn on, by My L. Commiſſioners ſtraining humours, about the authoritie both of King, Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> and Lords of <hi>Seſſion,</hi> and after a ſecond appeal made in the ſame manner, the Lords, according to their uſuall dyet, breake up untill the firſt of June, whether to the increaſing, or abating the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance here mentioned, I leave it to others to Judge, and to time to determin.</p>
            <p>The ſixth grievance is <hi>generall gifts of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> caſualities</hi> ſuch as the generall gift of <hi>Wards and Marriages</hi> to the Earle of Kincaerden, contrarie to expreſſe Acts of Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, and to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> great prejudice, and the vexation or his ſubjects: For theſe caſualties, being of an undetermined extent, as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66384:11"/>
as the death of Vaſſals, and ordinarilie attended vvith many circumſtances, vvhereof his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> equitie and goodneſſe can onely beſt arbitrate; the reaſon both of the lavv, and alſo of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> and his ſubjects their intereſt, againſt all ſuch gifts, is abundantlie obvious. Neither is the aggravation, ariſing from the perſons, the procurer, and the purchaſer, leſſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; the D. of Laud, and Earle of Kincaerden are, both of them, Commiſſioners of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Treaſurie, and alſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Lords of the <hi>Seſſion,</hi> ſo that being doublie obliged, by theſe two great and honourable truſts, equallie to intend his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> advantage, and the obſervation or his laws, their delinquencie in this point, cannot but be accounted a high miſdemeanor; vvhich to excuſe, by ſaying, that, notvvithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the gift, no action hath been thereon founded, but all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings carried on in his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> name, and by his Officers, after the uſuall form; vvhen in the mean time, My L. Kincaerd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en doth treat, and compound, and takes up the profits of all ſentences, vvhat is it elſe ſave to acknovvlegde a tranſgreſſion of the ſenſe, in the manifeſt circumvention of the vvords, of the lavv: Is is true that this gift is not the firſt of this nature that hath been granted: Immediatlie after his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> return My L. Lauderdaill and others got a gift of all preceeding caſualities, and the Earle of Kincaerden, had alſo a prior gift for three years, whereof this is onely a prorogation, by vertue of all which many thouſands of pounds have been very rigorouſlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted: but ſeing, there can be hardlie any thing more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, then to pretend a priviledge in evill from mens forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it is evident that theſe things, do onely render the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance exceedinglie more grievous.</p>
            <p>Theſe three laſt grievances, having been moved in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, immediatlie before its Dec<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> adjournment, before I paſſe to other things that were not moved, I ſhall brieflie narrate two other paſſages, that were thought alſo to influence it. The firſt ſhall be of one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paterſon Dean or Edenburgh; this man, after the firſt conflict in Parlt. about a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be made to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, preaching before the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, was pleaſed to tell his auditors, <hi>that ſomtimes God
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66384:14"/>
for the ſins of a people would raiſe up a fawning Abſalom to flatter, and kiſſe them, and to ſteal away their hearts, by bemoaning their grievances, and ſaying that their matters were good and right, but there was no man deputed of the King to hear them,</hi> untill at <hi>length a Sheba the ſon of Bichri, should ariſe to ſound the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of rebellion and ſay, We have no part in David, &amp;c.</hi> with many moe words to this purpoſe; which diſcourſe, by all its circumſtances, carrying an intollerable reflexion upon ſome members of Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, and that ſo obviouſlie, that notwithſtanding that Mr. Paterſon did ſwear, that he thereby intended no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, yet, unleſſe they had been <hi>inſpired,</hi> it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible not to think them <hi>deſigned</hi>; there is thereupon a complaint exhibited, craving that Mr. Paterſon might be called to account for ſuch ſeditious ſpeeches; This the Commiſſioner would at firſt have waved, and then, finding that it was like to be warmlie preſſed, he agrees, that the examination be committed to the Lords of the Clergie, but although a competent time was given them, and their report often demanded, yet it was ſtill declined and delayed without any iſſue.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſhall be about Sr. Andrew Ramſey, This man having been Proveiſt of Edenburgh under Oliver, and complyed with him to the height of being Knighted, and thereafter getting himſelfe reknighted and reentred Proveiſt by the E. of Midletons favour, upon his diſgrace, very quicklie ſtrikes in with My L. Laud., with whom and the tradeſmen of Edenburgh, he by his long-practiſed arts, of flatterie, and briberie, did ſo mightilie prevail, that after having been ten years Proveiſt, and in that time domineered over the Citie, and enriched himſelfe by their rents and moneys at his pleaſure, he dreamed of nothing leſſe, then a perpetuall <hi>dictatorship</hi>: What kind deallings, during theſe years, were betwixt My Lo. Laud. and him is ſufficientle known, the office of Proveiſt which never had before either fee or ſalarie, yet now by My L. Laud, <hi rend="sup">s.</hi> procurement in behalfe of his favourit, hath a penſion of 200. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. yearlie, annexed to it. 2dly. the Militia, being eſtabliſhed, the Proveiſt is made Collonell, and his ſon Major, of Edenburgh regiment, and with a 100. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. to the Major of yearlie ſalarie. 3dly. S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Andrevv having, neither
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66384:14"/>
for a juſt price, nor by the faireſt means, got a title to a bare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant rock in the ſea, called, the <hi>Baſs,</hi> and to a publick debt, both belonging to the L. of Wachton; My L. Lauder., to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie Sr. Andrew, moves the King, upon the pretence of this publick debt, and that the <hi>Baſs</hi> was a place of ſtrength (like to a caſtle in the moon) and of great importance, (the onely neſt of Solen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geeſe in theſe parts) to buy the rock from Sr. Andrew, at the rate of 4000. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt., and then obtains the command and profits of it, amounting to more then a 100. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. yearlie, to be beſtowed upon himſelfe. But, beſides this, there was alſo here an open reciprocation on S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Andrews part; for it having pleaſed his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, about the ſame time, to perpetuate to the Town of Edenburgh a gift, which they had enjoyed for ſome years by temporarie grants, S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Andrew takes this occaſion to expreſſe his gratitude to his Patron, and repreſenting to the town, how much My L. Laud. had befriended them in that matter, he perſwades them to acknowledge it, with a benevolence of 5000. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. 4thly. My Lo. Laud. procures S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Andrew, to be made firſt a privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, then a Commiſſioner of the Exchequer, and laſt of all a Lord. of the <hi>Seſſion,</hi> allthough the beſt breeding that ever he had, for theſe employments, was that of his being once a merchant.</p>
            <p>But here, ill-natured envie maliciouſlie diſdaining theſe ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous preferments, and taking the advantage of S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Andrews manifold maleverſation, incites firſt the murmurings of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and then at <hi>Michaelmeſs</hi> 1672, the oppoſition of ſome of their Councell, againſt his continuance in office: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Andrew, albeit with extream wreſtling, gets through for that time, and to prevent the recurring of the like difficultie, thinks fitt to inform My L. Laud., that ſome factious perſons had ſtirred up tumults, to diſturb his election, and thereupon his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> letters are directed to the privie Councell, ordering them to examin the matter, and report: When the privie Councell received theſe letters, the moſt part were not a litle ſurprized, to ſee a command from Court, to enquire about a tumult, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to have been made, in the place of their reſidence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had not before heard; yet in obedience, albeit there was as good as nothing found, the report was made, which all men
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66384:15"/>
judged would be the cloſe of that affair: But S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Andrew being reſolved, notwithſtanding that the body of the Citie was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie ſett againſt him, to carrie alſo the next election, the better to prepare for it, obtains by My. L. Laud. a letter from the King, in Sept<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> laſt to the Town-Councell of Edenburgh, reſuming the ſtorie of the tumult, and thereupon ordaining Mr. Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heed their Clerk to be removed from his office, as being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acceſſorie, concluding that his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> would ſuperſede to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin as to others, untill he ſhould be informed of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in the enſuing election: I ſhall not mention all the litle inſolencies, wherewith S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Andrew did execute theſe orders againſt that Gentleman; the thing conſiderable is, that all that heard of this letter, and how that thereby, contrarie to law, the right of the Clerks office, was arbitrarilie taken from him, without being heard, and the Town-Councell alſo indirectlie overawed in the freedom of their electing, did look upon the impetrating thereof, as a moſt dangerous precedent, threatning every mans propertie and libertie, and therefore, not onely was the Clerk encouraged to raiſe an action declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of his right and for repoſſeſſion, but My L. Laud. preceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the generall reſentment was juſtlie levelled againſt himſelfe, as the principall author of this high attempt, he again by a ſecond act, impoſing no leſſe upon his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> 
               <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> then by the former he had abuſed his <hi>juſtice,</hi> moves his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> to write a ſecond letter, ordering M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Roughheed to be reſtored, without the leaſt acknowledgement, to a place, from which, not 10. weeks before, he had been, by the ſame method, removed as a ſeditious incendiarie: Theſe then and ſeverall other of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Andrews high misdemeanors, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedlie occaſioned a complaint to be exhibited againſt him in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, the Commiſſioner, obſerving well what might be its conſequence, and yet unwilling openlie to undertake his defence &amp; patrocinie, conſents that the matter be referred to the Lords of the <hi>Articles,</hi> and there again obtains that the tryall of the things charged, ſhould be remitted to the ordinarie Courts: But the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> knowing as well as his Grace that thoſe exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies, that flow from the abuſe of favour, are commonlie

coloured with ſuch conveyances, as plain and poſitive laws, (to which theſe Courts are tyed,) doe rarelie ſuſpect and ſo very ſeldom provide againſt; doe therefore ſtill inſiſt that the Lords of the <hi>Articles</hi> would bring in their report; whereupon My Lo. Commiſſioner, underſtanding better then any man S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews guilt and his own acceſſion, as a fitt expedient, both to appeaſe the people, and to decline ſo concerning an accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; upon the Sabbath, wheedles Sr Andrew unto a voluntarie dimiſſion of all his places and employments, and upon the Tueſday thereafter adjourns the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> and how he hath ſince endeavoured to repreſent him, both here &amp; at Court, as if he alone were chargeable with all his offences is aboundantlie known.</p>
            <p>I have been the more ample in this narration, becauſe that, with all reverence to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, (whom I know to be infinitlie removed from all communication in My Lo. Laud<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. naughtie practices) and proportions alſo being obſerved, and the parallels duelie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced from the Year 1662., I doe indeed take S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Andrew Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey with reference to My L. Laud. and the Citie of Edenburgh, to be a very exact modell of Lauderdaill himſelfe, in order to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> and all Scotland, and therefore the more ingratfull is his confidence that under ſuch a preſſing conviction, ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> and the Kingdom, in compleeting the ſimilitude by a ſpontaneous dimiſſion.</p>
            <p>Having thus gone thorough theſe motions made in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> about the <hi>Mint, Lords of Seſſion, generall gifts, Dean Paterſon and Sr An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Ramſey</hi> I now proceed to theſe other grievances, which, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit not allowed to be brought in, were notwithſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ſeverall members, and, in probabilitie, would have been the principall points in the repreſentation which was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, to be made to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeventh grievance then is <hi>the accumulation of eminent offices upon ſingle perſons</hi>: I ſhall not here reflect upon the ſufficiencie or inſufficiencie of any, I heartilie wiſh that all men were as carefull to cover, as I am willing to conceal their weakneſſe; but the plain ground of complaint is, that My L. Laud. hath procured to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the L. Hatton his brother, and to the Earles of Athol and Kincaerden, his particular freinds, not onely the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66384:16"/>
but alſo the farr greater part, of the more important charges of the kingdom, to the viſible weakening of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to the detriment of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> ſervice; thus the D. of Laud. himſelfe, is</p>
            <p>Firſt, Preſident of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Councell.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly ſole Secretarie.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly one of the Commiſſioners of the Treaſurie:</p>
            <p n="4">4thly Captain of the Caſtle of Edenburgh.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly Captain of the <hi>Baſs.</hi>

            <p n="2">2dly Vice-Admirall of Scotland.</p>
            <p>And 3dly one of the four extraordinarie Lords of Seſſion. Principall offices are the ſtayes, as it were, of a State, and their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is, not ſo much determined by their objects, as by the proportionable capacities that moſt of them do require; beſide, as in the multitude of Counſellors there is <hi>ſafetie,</hi> ſo in the multitude of Officers there is <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and their right diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, doth not more encourage virtue and reward merit, then it ſettles the adminiſtration of the kingdom by a juſt ballance, and thereby becometh equallie advantagious, for the peoples good, and the Princes ſecuritie: But humour and ambition doe puffe at ſuch creeping politicks. My Lo. Laud. hath alſo introduced the abuſe <hi>of gifts of the reverſions or ſurvivances of places</hi> to children &amp; boys, and ſuch are the gifts to My L. Hatton and his ſon of the Mint-office, to S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> Charles Erskin and his ſon of the <hi>Lyons</hi> Office,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66384:16"/>
&amp; ſeverall others of that nature; by which continuance of offices, that, at moſt, uſed to be conferred <hi>ad vitam,</hi> his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, is deprived of that excellent part of his treaſure, which, with no expence, rewards virtue beſt, and is indeed the onely fond of the moſt obliging gratifications.</p>
            <p>The eighth grievance <hi>is the mal-adminiſtration and profuſion of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> revennue:</hi> The cleering of this head, in its full extent, would require a more prolix &amp; accurate computation, than is proper for my preſent work; but that I may give it its neceſſarie evidence &amp; alſo diſcover, more fullie, the fruits &amp; effects at My L. Laud<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie, I ſhall onely here ſett down, in generall, firſt what ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of money he and his three friends have got in donatives: and 2dly. what ſummes they receive yearlie by their places and penſions, as hath been made appear on ſeverall occaſions by a particular condeſcendence. My L. Laud. then, hath got in dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives within theſe few years no leſſe then 26900. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. and may be reckoned to have yearlie ſince the year 1669. that he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Commiſſioner, 16350. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt.</p>
            <p>My L. Hatton hath got in donatives to the value of 15300. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. and hath moreover yearlie 1196. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt., beſide he hath the profits of the Mint and bullion, which laſt did render in Kings James his time 1000. marks Scots weeklie amounting yearlie to 2500. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt.</p>
            <p>The E. of Athole got latelie by fines 1500. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. and poſſeſſeth yearlie 1450. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt.</p>
            <p>The E. of Kincaerdens gettings by reaſon of the nature of his gifts and places, cannot be ſo eaſilie computed, but that they muſt be very conſiderable, by his generall gift of Wards and Marriages, which he hath had above theſe three years, may be evidentlie gathered, from the benefit that he hath made, by ſome of thoſe particular obventions, which have been compounded for by him, at, or above, the rate of a 1000. <abbr>lb.</abbr> how much then may be reckoned, by all that fall over the whole Kingdom? he got alſo the gift of a ſhip wrackt in Schetland. As for his yearlie incomes, beſide his penſion as one of the Commiſſioners of the Treaſurie, he hath alſo all the perquiſits of the Admiralitie, and yet over and above ſhould have had by the gift of the Salt, at leaſt, 2000. <abbr>lb.</abbr> yearlie. Now whether theſe be not exceſſive largeſſes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66384:17"/>
to ſuch perſons, for ſuch ſervices, and in the more <hi>honeſt</hi> then <hi>opulent</hi> Kingdom of Scotland is eaſie to be judged: I grant I have included in the totall of My L. Laud<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. yearlie ſumms, the penſion of 500. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt., which he procured, out of our Exchecquer, to his Dutcheſſe, when ſhe was onely Counteſſe of Dyſert, and not his married wife; but I ſuppoſe that their then circumſtances being conſidered, the error will be excuſed, with leſſe pain, then it would have been for me, to make the diſtinction. I need not here ſubjoin how that, beſide theſe above-mentioned ſumms, almoſt all penſions and gifts have been beſtowed, theſe years bypaſt, according to his Graces pleaſure; his power in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs being in effect an omnipotencie, this part of it is not to be doubted, onely it is to be regrated, that in all theſe exceſſive givings, ſo litle reſpect hath been had to thoſe, who have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited moſt of his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, both by their actings and ſufferings. But the thing, that I eſteem more worthie to be noticed, is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſince his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> reſtitution, his revenue in Scotland hath been much above the double of what it was before, and though his caſualties have been exacted with abundance of diligence, and great and vaſt ſumms otherwiſe levied by fynes, taxations, and aſſeſſements, without the leaſt burden, either of monies exported for his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> uſe, or of forraign warr; yet, through a ſtrange miſgovernment, hath all been waſted, and conſumed, at home, without any viſible improvement, for the publick good, or ſo much as the proviſion of one freggat, for the defence of our coaſt, or convoy of our merchants, in theſe times of warr.</p>
            <p>The 9th. grievance and fountain of all the reſt is <hi>My L. Laud<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. exceſſive greatneſſe,</hi> farr above what, either the Kingdom, or himſelfe can bear; I have alreadie obſerved, how that before he was Commiſſioner, he had, by reaſon of his being our <hi>ſole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie</hi> and <hi>Court-Miniſter,</hi> the abſolute rule and diſpoſe of all our concerns; an interpoſition ungratefull enough, to a people, ſo affectionatlie, dutifull to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> I have alſo marked, with what a ſevere jealouſie, he debarred all Scotchmen, from any acceſſe or opportunitie, ſo much as to ſpeak to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, otherwiſe then he pleaſed; a practice no leſſe diſſerviceable to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, then diſobliging to free fellow-ſubjects; I might in the 3d.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66384:17"/>
place add, that, as his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> neceſſarie abſence hath occaſioned to us the unhappineſſe of My L. Lauds. domination, ſo his Graces abſence alſo, for the moſt part, at Court, doth further ſubject us to a more baſe, &amp; diſingenuous dependence, upon his ceatures &amp; favourits, nay oftentimes, even upon his ſervants, with whom it is well known, that men did ordinarilie tranſact, for the obtaining and expeding of gifts and ſignatures, &amp; that it was, eſpeciallie by his Graces ſervants, that perſonall protections to debtors, were moſt abuſivlie impetrat: But ſeing the greateſt part of what I have ſaid, hath been, to ſett forth the miſerable iſſues of Lauderdails obſcuring and eclipſing grandour, I ſhall in this place, onely note, how by his exaltation to be his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Commiſſioner, this noxious exhalation came as it were to be conſolidat into that malign mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or which hath reduced us unto the afflicted and diſconſolat eſtate in which we doe at preſent languiſh. I need not repeet, that it was for the attaining to this high, and unaccountable power, that he deviſed the calling of this Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, upon the pretext of an Union, no leſſe groundleſſe in its project, then vain in its ſucceſſe; nor ſhall I reſume, by what means, and for what emptie reaſons, the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> hath hitherto been kept current: That the office of <hi>Commiſſioner</hi> is a thing, altogether extraordinarie, &amp; onely warranted by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occaſion, &amp; ſpeciall effect for which he is ordained, is a point ſo certain, that to affirm the contrarie, would be no leſſe, then a treaſonable attempt, to ſubvert the very foundations of this free Monarchie; when in former times Commiſſions of this ſort, were granted (which yet we doe not find to have been in uſe untill after King James his goeing to England) both the Commiſſions and the Par<hi rend="sup">lt</hi>. uſed to be terminated in one <hi>ſeſſion</hi>; the firſt that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, upon the innovation of adjourning Par<hi rend="sup">lts.</hi> for a long time and, continuing his Commiſſion in the intervall, was the E. of Midleton; and yet, notwithſtanding of all the high ſtrainings, that were then in faſhion, and that the Earles worke, could hardlie be ſooner compleeted, this ſame Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daill did, ſo farr reſent it, as to make Midletons drawing out of his Commiſſion (though for litle more then two years) an article of his accuſation. But now that My L. Laud. hath himſelfe got into the power, he hath preſumed to protract it, now more then four yeares and a halfe, with ſo litle appearance of any neceſſitie, that on the contrair, we plainlie ſee, how that he hath, both hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66384:18"/>
the Par<hi rend="sup">lts.</hi> proceedings, and endeavoured to fruſtrate all its late meetings: which, as it is a manifeſt violenting of the ancient, and naturall conſtitution of our government; ſo the unneceſſarie continuance, and arbitrarie and frequent long adjournments of this Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>; hath contributed exceedinglie to the increaſe of our burdens, and diſtreſſes. But the truth is, that ſuch hath been his deportment in this eminent truſt, that it is now become his beſt ſecuritie; and what at firſt his <hi>ambition</hi> did proudlie contrive, his <hi>conſcience of guilt</hi> doth now oblige him, no leſſe tenaciouſlie, to maintain: ſo that our remedie and relief in this our deſolate and abandoned condition, remains onely with God, and his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, in the return of their favour.</p>
            <p>From which conſideration, as much as for the obviating of miſinformation, it pleaſed the D. of Hamiltoun, and Earle of Tweddel, with ſome other Gentlemen, after the adjournment of the Parlt. in Dec<hi rend="sup">r</hi> laſt, to go for Court, with the inexpreſſible good-liking of the whole Countrey, who from their faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, did confidentlie expect, an entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. But My L. Laud., that he might ſhew himſelfe, no leſſe croſſe to, then he was averſe from, ſuch a loyall enterpriſe, omitts no obſtruction, that he could lay in the way; and firſt, by a pittifull fellow in Berwick, whom he had before corrupted to ſpy and intercept all free correſpondence, he cauſeth ſeiſe, detain priſoner, and ſearch S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> William Carnegie a member of Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, in his paſſage through that Town to London. 2dly. having, by the ſame hand, got ſome packets intercepted, he very ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly tranſmitts them to Court, and without reſpect to the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion done to the common intercourſe and good underſtanding of the two nations, or regard to that tenderneſſe, which moſt men doe retain for their Countreys honour, he obtains for his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencer his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>. approbation, and a reward of 50. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. out of our exchequer. 3dly. by the ſame means, and in the ſame place, he endeavours to affront D. Hamiltoun and his companie, in their paſſage, by a ſuſpicious queſtioning of their attendents, and refuſing them the conveniencie of a nights lodging, which, how farr it was contrarie to the generoſitie of the Governour, then abſent, and the civilitie of the Citizens, they ſince fullie
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:66384:18"/>
evidenced by that noble reception, which they gave the Duke in his return. And laſtlie, My L. Laud. impoſes ſo farr, upon his Mati<hi rend="sup">es</hi> good nature, as to move him to diſcountenance a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſent before by D. Hammiltoun, under a groundleſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text ſuggeſted by Lauderdaill, that he had been one of Olivers Sequeſtrators, contrarie to that prudent and benign part of the act of Indemnitie, prohibiting the remembrance of all <hi>odious names,</hi> whereof his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> hath been always moſt tender.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe rubbs, and many other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, D. Hammiltoun and E. Tweddell being arrived at Court, doe there very freelie and faithfullie acquitt themſelves, in a full and particular account of all things, relating to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> or the Countreys intereſt; I need not here ſtand, to give the ſtorie by retail; it is like that the impreſſions were various, but in a word the reſult was the ſame, with the period which vve have heard, vvas putt to all the good votes and reſolves of the Engliſh Par<hi rend="sup">lt</hi>; hovvever having had the good fortune to hear accidentallie of a letter, and aftervvards to ſee its double, vvhich, I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diblie informed, vvas delivered unto his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, much about the time that our Lords vvere there, I have thought good, here, to ſett dovvn, for publick ſatiſfaction, its juſt tranſcript.

                  <p>SIR, Theſe preſſures are, ſo heavie in themſelves, &amp; have been &amp; are ſo afflicting &amp; diſquieting to your poor people, that I am confident, were it poſſible for you to reflect upon them, without obſerving by whom they have been procured, your Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Iustice would not ſooner prompt you to the remedie, than to a ſtrict enquiry and animadverſion against their authors, yea move you, even in the first place, to call out, with Ahaſuerus upon like occaſion, <hi>Who is he and where is he that durſt preſume in his heart to doe ſo?</hi> But ſeeing that your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, in your unparalleled goodneſſe, doth ſeem rather to incline to a gracious reliefe with a healing compoſure of all differences, than to notice paſt miſdemeanours, I shall onely in all humilitie preſume to ſay, that whatever may be your royall clemencie, yet certainlie the cauſers of theſe wrongs cannot be the fitt inſtruments of an effectuall and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying redreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> is not unacquainted with the untoward &amp; croſſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the last Seſſion of Par<hi rend="sup">lt:</hi> If your Commiſſioner was ſo uneaſie, and diſobliging, in his interruptings, and adjournings, when nothing was craved, but the remedie of ſuch things, which both your Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> ſervice, and your peoples cryes, did inſtantly demand, can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, that in the things that remain (ſo much the more grievous, and unjuſtifiable, that he and a few of his friends are moſtlie therein inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ested) he will be more complacent? Nay S<hi rend="sup">ir</hi>, it is evident as the light, that all the repugnancie, that he hath hitherto shewed, with his high pretendings, and ſtretchings of your Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> prerogative in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Lords of the <hi>Articles,</hi> beyond what the nature and dignitie of Par<hi rend="sup">lts</hi> will bear, hath plainlie been to prevent the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of your Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> to this tryall. The just and neceſſarie motions for examining his Brothers coine, and the Lords of Seſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the weakeſt are his friends, did provoke him to an abrupt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66384:19"/>
ſince that time what arts have been uſed, and what methods practiſed, for gaining particular perſons, and ſtrengthning of the party, is too well known to all, to be unknown to your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>: He hath indeed thought good to anticipate the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> in the matter of the Mint, but in a way ſo partiall, and eluſorie, that whether your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, your Par<hi rend="sup">lt</hi>, or your people be thereby moſt injured, is hard to be determined. So that, upon the whole matter, conſidering, that things in controverſie doe purelie reſpect your peoples good; and, on the one hand, are proſecuted, with the moſt legall intentions of ſuch, who have allways been faithfull to your intereſt; and yet, on the other part, are ſtill oppoſed, with obſtinate partialitie, and untractable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; It is beyond all queſtion, that the enſueing Seſſions, if holden by the ſame Commiſſioner, will neceſſarilie be attended with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, if not greater heats and diſorders. I can not alſo forbear to tell your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, that hitherto your people are perſwaded, that in all their ſufferings, your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> hath been more abuſed, and impoſed upon than they, themſelves; how expedient then it is, that this perſwaſion should ſtill continue, and that theſe incident errors of government should be at leaſt gentlie expiated, by fixing them upon the true au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, your Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, who hath allways valued yourſelfe ſo much upon your peoples affections, can onely beſt judge; ſeeing therefore that your people have been oppreſſed, by a malverſation not more irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating in its effects, than in the obſtinacie wherewith it is defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that they exſpect relief from your royall goodneſſe, with an aſſurance not to be diſappointed, without a very ſurprizing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and laſtlie, ſeeing nothing is deſired, or intended in order to the D. of Lauderdaill, to which he himſelfe ought not, both in dutie, and prudence moſt readilie to agree; let theſe in all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie ſollicit your Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> tranſcendent bountie, to conſider the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing propoſalls, which are not more eaſie in themſelves, then they will prove moſt effectuall, at once, to diſſipate all evill appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and reſtore to this your ancient Kingdom, that ſerene peace, which will make our affection and dutie again to flourish, in moſt ſignificant acknowledgements.</p>

               <q>And Joab came into the houſe to the King and ſaid thou haſt ſhamed this day the faces of all thy ſervants, which, this day, have ſaved thy life, and the lives of thy ſones, and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines, in that tbou loveſt thine enemies, and hateſt thy friends: for thou haſt declared, this day, that thou reguardeſt, neither Princes, nor ſervants; for, this day, I perceive, that if Abſolom had lived, and all we had died, this day, then it had pleaſed the well; now therefore ariſe, goe forth and ſpeake comfortablie unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: for, I ſwear by the Lord, if thou goe not forth, there will not tarrie one with thee this night; &amp; that will be worſe unto thee, then all the evill that befell thee from thy youth untill now.</q>

way and behaviour, not impertinent to the things that we have all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie heard, ſuch as, firſt, his arrogant undervalue of Par<hi rend="sup">lts.</hi>, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by that expreſſion to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> againſt the E. of Midletons ſervices, <hi>S<hi rend="sup">ir</hi>, if you had ſent down a dog with your commiſſion about his neck to your Scotch Par<hi rend="sup">lt,</hi> he would have done all that E.

Hammiltoun, and moſt of the antient nobilitie of greateſt intereſt and conſideration in the Kingdom, whom he did not ſo much as allow to be named to be of the number, of the Commiſſioners choſen for the Treatie of the Union betwixt the two Kingdoms. 4thly. his ſtrange inconſtancie, in his friendſhips acted meerlie by his humour or advantage, as witneſſe his dealings with the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of Rothes, Tweddell and Argyle, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Robert Murray, D. of Ormond, E.

To . . . . Scot of Ardroſſe and Major Borthwick, a gift upon the Maltmen and Brewers; and to the ſame Major Borthwick another vexatious gift, called ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narilie <hi>of peck and bole.</hi> 6thly. his prophane complement to the Archbiſhop of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Andrews, coming one day to viſit him, <hi>Come in, My Lord, ſit down here at my right hand untill I make all your enemies your footſtool.</hi> 7thly. his dull and malicious Ieſtings, againſt his old practices, and acquaintances, as when one day at his table, he ſaid, he could pray as well as any Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and ſo begunn a long complaint to God of covenant-breaking and other ſins to their deriſion; and when at other times he hath inſulted over them in their appearances,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66384:21"/>
before the Councell, by a reproachfull remembrance of by-paſt courſes, ſo that ſome of them have applyed to him the old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque <hi>omnis Apoſtata ſuae ſectae oſor:</hi> But it is not to theſe onely that he confines this humour, he makes it ſerve alſo in other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, as when it was ſaid about grievances, that they ought not onely to be redreſſed, but prevented for the future, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with much noiſe, <hi>that this was like an overture of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Kirk, &amp;c.</hi> as if in effect his fancie were leſed with the remains of his old hypocriſie. But paſſing theſe things, that may ſavour of a deſign of perſonall reflexion, which is trulie farr from me, it may be to better purpoſe to ſuſpend a litle the cloſure of this relation, in two more important remarques.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that in the firſt ſeſſion of this Par<hi rend="sup">lt</hi>, and for its firſt Act, his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Supremacie was enacted, whereby <hi>it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared not onely that his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> hath the ſupream authoritie over all perſons and in all cauſes within this Kingdom, and that by virtue thereof, the ordering of the externall government, and policie of the Church, doth properlie belong to him; but that his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, and his Succeſſors may ſetle, enact and emitt ſuch conſtitutions, acts, and orders, concerning all eccleſiaſticall perſons, meetings and Matters</hi> (a word infinitlie extenſive, comprehending the <hi>all</hi> of Religion) <hi>as they in their royall wiſdom shall think fit.</hi> It is true that this was unanimouſlie conſented to by the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, and it is as well known, that all that the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> had in view, was the eſtabliſhing of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> power and authoritie, for the better confirmation of a litle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, then latelie granted to ſome Non-conforming Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the more effectuall checqueing of the <hi>loyall Clergies</hi> murmurings, who pretended to a <hi>Negative</hi> in theſe affairs. But that the D. of Laud. had quite another deſign, in the paſſing of this Act, even the raiſing of his own credit and conſideration at Court, and the aggrandizing of himſelfe, by an acceſſion to that power, whereof he then had, and ſtill hath the ſway, did quicklie diſcover it ſelfe, in its firſt application, directed againſt the Arch-Biſhop of Glaſgow; for My L. Laud. having conceived an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable grudge againſt this gentleman, moſtlie, becauſe he had on ſome occaſions addreſſed himſelfe to the King, otherwiſe then by him, the poor Biſhop is menaced, to have articles exhibited
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66384:22"/>
againſt him, before the Privie Councell, and thereupon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, to dimitt; but this is not the ſole Act, wherein My L. Laud. hath propoſed to himſelfe the ſame aim: I have alreadie ſhewed, how that the Act. 1663; entituled <hi>an Humble Tender, &amp;c.</hi> and offering 22. thouſand men to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> ſervice, was eſpeciallie of Laud<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> framing, &amp; it is very well known, hovv at Court he hath often ſince that time valued himſelfe very highlie, upon it: But novv being Commiſſioner, his induſtrious advancement of what at firſt, was, onely more generallie agreed to, doth exhibit a more ſatisfying diſcoverie, and therefore we ſee, vvith vvhat care, in the very next Act to that of Supremacie, he goes about to ſetle the Militia, not as a ſimple Countrey-conceit, for the better training of men to the uſe of Armes; but upon the more <hi>martiall baſis,</hi> &amp; for thoſe more <hi>noble ends</hi> of the former Act, &amp; <hi>humble tender.</hi> I vvill not, for all this, ſay, that at that time he had in proſpect, the great things vvhereof he hath ſince been ſuſpected, yet I make no doubt, but, that even then, he looked upon the Supremacie &amp; the Militia, ſo ſetled, &amp;, in a manner, both in his own hand, as being the Kings Commiſſioner, as tvvo <hi>brave leading cards,</hi> vvherewith ſuch a Court-gameſter as he, in the many chances, and changes, that do there happen, might ſomtime or other come to do <hi>mightie feats.</hi> I love not to heighten, let be to creat, jealouſies, nor have I any facultie in the ſearch of <hi>hidden and dark</hi> counſels; &amp; therefore do very unwillinglie take up, or aſſent to, vulgar reports of My L. Laud<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. after-engagements, in arbitrarie &amp; popiſh projects: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, ſuch indications, as runn into a mans eyes, can hardlie be diſſembled. It may then, be remembered; that, vvhen in the ſummer 1672, the Cabal at Court vvas in its <hi>aſcendent,</hi> &amp; Laud. got to be on the top of it, and that matters in England vvere come to a very manifeſt <hi>criſis; My</hi> L. Laud. about the ſame time goes for Scotland, and there procures a new Act of Militia to be made, <hi>ſtatuting that all perſons, who should be therein enrolled, should be entirelie reſerved for that employment, and that both Officers, and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers should take the oath of Allegiance</hi> (vvhich vvith us includes alſo the Supremacie,) and is, I ſuppoſe, a <hi>ſacramentum militare</hi> vvithout a preſident) and by another Act he obtains, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a twelve moneths aſſeſſement, to <hi>ly for a ſtock of money for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66384:22"/>
for their proviſion,</hi> and that upon this expreſſe narrative viz. <hi>That as the Kingdom of Scotland will cheerfullie hazard their lives, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, in the warr against the Dutch, or any other cauſe wherein his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> ſafetie, honour, or interest may be concerned: So in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they have ſo ſetled the Militia, as the forces of the Kingdom, may be in readineſſe, when ever his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> shall be pleaſed for theſe ends to make uſe of them.</hi> Which things in Scotland and England being laid together, &amp; the ſtrange twiſtings of the <hi>Supremacie</hi> that makes ſo large a ſurrender of matters of Religion, with theſe Acts of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> &amp; <hi>Maintenance,</hi> declaring a readineſſe for any expedition, &amp;c. being well weighed; I think, it may warrantablie be affirmed, that if there was any extraordinary deſign at that time in agitation, My L. Laud<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. hand, in probabilitie, was deepeſt in it. Neither can the Par<hi rend="sup">lts.</hi> concurrence, in conſenting to theſe Acts, be pleaded for his excuſe: For as much as it is certain, that their pure and ſingle intent was, a dutiful expreſſion of their loyaltie, for which they have always judged, that no words capable of a fair ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, could ever be too ſignificant. I need not adduce their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquaintedneſſe with ſecret tranſactions for their purgation; he that can imagin, that Scotland would have conſented, to that heavie aſſeſſement, out of any other motive, then their abſolute &amp; implicite affection to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, let be in any thoughts of favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poperie, is widelie miſtaken, both of our <hi>riches and religion:</hi> And therefor it may well be concluded, that as the ill favoured aſpect, of the Act and <hi>Humble Tender &amp;c.</hi> and Acts of <hi>Militia</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueing on it, toward England, with their ill contrived alternative, <hi>or for any other ſervice wherein his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> honour, authoritie, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may be concerned,</hi> were at firſt the dictates of Lauderdails vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and have often ſince been the boaſtings of his ambition; ſo they do plainlie enough evince, his black acceſſion to thoſe other myſteries, whereof he hath elſewhere been accuſed.</p>
            <p>The 2d. remarque ſhall be, concerning My L. Laud<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> 
               <hi>admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in Church affairs.</hi> It is not neceſſarie to remember how that E. Midleton in his Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> thought fit, to correct <hi>the rigour</hi> of Presbyterie, by the <hi>heights</hi> of Prelacie, &amp; what <hi>a ſevere vengeance</hi> of conformitie, the Biſhops did thereafter execute, upon the whole Countrey, for their former complyance with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66384:23"/>
affection to their <hi>brethren</hi> of that miniſtrie: O when ſhall Princes know, wherein the <hi>true power,</hi> and <hi>peaceableneſſe</hi> of the Goſpell doth lye; &amp; deliver themſelvs &amp; their people, from the <hi>pedantrie, &amp; hypocriſie</hi> of all Church-pretenders! However the extreme diſtreſſe, whereinto theſe Epiſcopall perſecutions had brought the Countrey, did in the year 1669 (as I have before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,) move the compaſſion of ſome more moderate perſons, to obtain for it the caſe of that ſmall indulgence, that was then granted, for the better eſtabliſhment whereof, it was ſuppoſed (as I have ſaid) that the <hi>ſupremacie</hi> was thereafter in Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> enacted. But that the Countrey might the better reliſh this favour, and know how to diſcern his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi>, from his Commiſſioners <hi>Grace,</hi> it pleaſed My L. Laud. that in the year 1670., conformitie ſhould be again commanded, and preſſed by new Acts of Par<hi rend="sup">lt</hi>, and thoſe, in my opinion, of a greater ſeveritie, then the higheſt points in Chriſtianitie could have allowed: For by the fifth Act of that Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (as alſo by the 17. Act of the 3. Seſſion) it is ſtatuted, that <hi>no Non-conform-Miniſter, not licenſed by the Councel, or other perſon, not authoriſed by the Bishop, shall</hi> (ſo much as) <hi>pray to God in any meeting, except in their own houſes, and to thoſe of their own families, and ſuch as shall be preſent not exceeding the number of four, and that all acceſſorie to the contrarie, shall be guiltie of keeping conventicles, and punished with the pains there ſpecified,</hi> the Article of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Creed <hi>I beleve the communion of Saints</hi> notwithſtanding. 2dly. by the ſame Act, it is declared, <hi>that whoſoever without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe or authoritie a foreſaid, shall preach or pray at any field-meeting, or in any houſe, where there be more perſons, then the houſe contains, ſo as ſome of them be without doors</hi> (who may be onely two or three, and poſted there by malice) <hi>or who shall convocate theſe meetings, shall be punished with death, and confiſcation of their goods, and the</hi> Seizers <hi>of ſuch perſons, are not onely indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifed for any ſlaughter that shall be committed, in the apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but alſo aſſured of</hi> 500. <hi>merks Scots of reward, for each perſon by them ſeiſed and ſecured</hi>; ſo mortall a thing is this field-conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticling, the Meſſe and all its idolatrie hath nothing in it ſo deadlie. 3dly. by the 6th. Act of that Seſſion, there are conſiderable pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniall pains ordained againſt <hi>diſorderlie baptiſmes,</hi> ſuch as thoſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66384:23"/>
are reckoned to be <hi>that are performed by outed Ministers not licenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or by any other then the parish Minister, without his certificate, or, in caſe he be abſent, the certificate of one of the neighbouring Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi> 4thly. by the 7th. Act, it is appointed, <hi>that all his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> ſubjects of the reformed religion</hi> (for Papiſts, that are without, God Judgeth) <hi>shall attend divine worship, in their own Churches, under the pecuniall pains there mentioned toties quoties &amp;c.</hi> and in caſe any landed man, ſhall withdraw for the ſpace of a year, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their being therefore fullie fyned, <hi>they are to be preſented to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Councell, who are authoriſed to require of them a bond not to riſe in arms against his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, or his Commiſſioner</hi> (as if a man could not be ſo far diſſatisfied with a pittifull Countrey Curat, but he muſt alſo be ſuſpected for diſaffection to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>) <hi>which if they refuſe, or delay, they are to be impriſoned, or banished, and both their ſingle and life-rent eſcheat doth immediatlie fall to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>
               </hi> And laſtlie by the 2d. Act of that ſame Seſſion, it <hi>is ſtatuted and ordained that all perſons, thereto called by the Councell, or others having his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Authoritie, are obliged in conſcience</hi> (very fair) <hi>and dutie, to declare and depoſe upon oath, their knowledge of any crime, and particularlie of any conventicles, and of the circumſtances, of the perſons preſent, and things done therein</hi>; may not then any one be brought from the ſtreets, and urged to become, upon oath, informer, accuſer or witneſſe upon all, that he ever ſaw or heard in his life, againſt himſelfe, his friend, father and all men elſe; <hi>or if he shall be ſo perverſelie wicked, or diſloyall, as to refuſe or delay, he is to be punished by fyneing, cloſe impriſonment, or banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by ſending him to the Indies, or elſewhere at the Councels plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>; ſure I am the Spaniſh Inquiſition hath no broader warrant. And yet notwithſtanding all theſe, My L. Laud: by a new act of the 3. Seſſion of this Par<hi rend="sup">lt</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> procures the execution of the above-mentioned Acts againſt conventiclers and withdrawers from publick worſhip to be enjoined to all Sheriffes and Magiſtrats, with an expreſſe proviſion that they ſhould render an account yearlie of their diligence under the pain of 500. merks Scots.</p>
            <p>But all theſe great efforts, of My L. Laud<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. zeal againſt Phanaticks, proveing by farr leſſe ſucceſſefull, then that litle ſpecimen of his

Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> clemencie, whereunto Lauderdaill, had been by others inclined, and it haveing pleaſed his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, in the year 1672. to gratifie his Proteſtant ſubjects in England, with his royall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he thinks meet at the ſame time to extend it, of new, to Scotland; and therefore gives to his Commiſſioner, then amongſt us, all neceſſarie inſtructions, for compleeting this worke: But his Grace being now quite freed, from all thoſe good influences wherewith ſometime he had been acted, by a very uncourteous, &amp; rude application, ſadlie marres his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> kindeneſſe, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrats its beſt end; for as much, as in place of that gracious reliefe, which, no doubt, was intended by his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, for all his non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming good ſubjectts, whether miniſters, or people, he plainlie turns this new Indulgence, into an univerſall confinement, of the whole non-conform Miniſters, unto ſome Pariſhes in a corner of the Countrey, leaving the reſt <hi>as dry or wett,</hi> as the ground, about Gideons fleece, and that, with ſuch a ſcornfull inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience (beſides ſome other ſcrupling conditions that were alſo impoſed) that to ſeuerall ſmall pariſhes, having not above à thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and communicants, and 900. or a 1000. merks Scots, of ſtipend, he cauſeth to be appointed, three or four miniſters, contrair to all Juſt proportions, and onely with the ridiculous equalitie, of <hi>as litle cure as litle ſallarie.</hi> Neither is he content to have thus can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonized thoſe that were licenſed, but even they that had none of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> 
               <hi>favour,</hi> muſt yet be made partakers of his Graces <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> and therefore, it is further ordered, that all other non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form miniſters not licenſed, ſhould either conform, in the places of their dvvelling, or elſe, before a certain day, repair to and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in the Pariſhes whereunto miniſters licenſed are appointed: I ſhall not ſay, that his Grace did thus reſtrain and clogg this Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, becauſe that the Councell, upon a letter which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent them down, from his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi>, to know if Papiſts might alſo have ſome tollerance, returned their advice that, they thought it neither neceſſarie, nor expedient; but it is obvious enough, that if Papiſts had been made partakers of this intended favour, it muſt of neceſſitie have been ſhaped out, and moulded, by ſome more eaſie regulation. And yet, as if by this conceſſion, there had been accumulated upon the Phanaticks, a bountie to which nothing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66384:24"/>
could be added, it is declared in the concluſion of the Councels Act, that they were not to looke for any further enlargement, but that the laws for conformitie were to be ſtrictlie executed, againſt all contraveeners; but the truth is, there was another motive, for this certification; his Grace knew very well, that not only the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie of that ſcrupling partie over Scotland, were litle oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by their being, in a manner, excepted from this his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties.</hi> 
               <hi>Grace,</hi> which often makes men, that before were uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to become more curious; but that ſome of them, who were now deprived of the libertie which at firſt was allowed to them, were thereby much irritat: And therefore he, in time, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides this colour for the executions that might again enſue. And truelie, if I were to form conjectures of mens deſignes, on the meaſures, that viſiblie appear to have been taken, in this ſorrie contryvance, I verily think, that all the ſpecious commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherewith it was magnified, would ſcarſelie, make me forbear to ſay, that its <hi>reſtrictedneſſe and uneaſineſſe,</hi> ſeem rather to have been intended for the marring, then any thing elſe, for the promoveing of its ſucceſſe. It is ſufficientlie manifeſt to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous men, that, the non-conformiſts, for all their ſcruples, are not onely ſincerelie, and ſecurelie loyall, but in effect, fullie as gentle and tractable, as can rationallie be exſpected, from thoſe principles, wherewith the <hi>Indulgence</hi> it ſelfe imports a diſpenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides if diſperſion &amp; the removing of the grounds of complaints be (as no doubt they are) the moſt effectuall means, to quiet ſuch opinionative diſtempers, what could have been more promiſeing, then to have diſpoſed upon the ſmall handfull of outed miniſters, that remain, either by returning them all freelie, to their own churches, or leaving them to ſetle, as fair invitations ſhould have determined. But alas, who ſies not the ſtrange conſequences, that would have enſued; if all wild beaſts were once tamed, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and their ſport would be utterlie ſpoiled, and a quiet and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied Kingdom, ſecured from almoſt the poſſibilitie, of forraign invaſion, would need no more any <hi>ſtanding</hi> forces, farr leſſe a <hi>ſtanding</hi> Commiſſioner; and how ſhould this poor countrey, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many vexations, have endured ſo great a loſſe. But that his Graces well diſpoſedneſſe, in affairs of this kinde, may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:66384:25"/>
underſtood, there is one inſtance of it, that I can not here omitt and it is thus; A litle before this Indulgence was granted, there were two countrey gentlemen, Hay of Ballhouſſie and Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond of Meggins, brought in queſtion, for this <hi>flagitious imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie</hi> of conventicling; the qualitie of their guilt was, that the firſt, had, indeed, had privat meetings in his own houſe, but the ſecond was onely charged, with his wife and daughters tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: However, his Grace haveing thought good, immediatlie upon the delation, to make over their fynes, unto his favourit the E. of Athole, and the gentlemen forſeing, that to make the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification ſuitable, there was no leſſe, then the utmoſt rigour to be exſpected; they judged it beſt, to abandon their own defence, for a friendlie tranſaction, &amp; therefore, caſting themſelves on the Earles diſcretion, they aggrie with him in writeing, the one to pay him 600. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt., and the other 400. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt.; but when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Councell, My L. Laud., not content with what Athole had done, very arbitrarlie and exorbitantlie, procures the ſentence to be augmented, againſt the firſt, to a 1000. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. and againſt the other to 500. <abbr>lb.</abbr> ſt. whether more generouſlie, towards his friend, who had got before, all that he had demanded, or more juſtlie towards the gentlemen, who relying upon the aggrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had prepared no other defence, let the world judge. I might alſo add another example of his Graces moderation, in cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Counteſſe of Wigtoun, a widow Lady, and otherwiſe cloathed with all the favourable circumſtances, that could be deſired, to appeare in perſon, before the Councell, to anſwer for privat meetings in her own houſe, and to be fyned in the ſumme of 5000. merks Scots, thereby ſhewing an impartialitie not to be byaſſed with any courteſie. But to return to our purpoſe, I need not mention particulars, for confirming of what I have ſaid, of the errours committed, in ſhapeing out this <hi>Indulgence:</hi> Its miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, as to the compoſeing of matters, whereunto it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, hath afforded, both to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> Councell, and to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters licenſed, too much unpleaſent exerciſe, in citations, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and reiterat orders, to leave it in the leaſt doubtfull. The thing, more worth our noticeing, is to conſider, how fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natlie the event did fall out, to juſtifie my ſuſpicion; I touched,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:66384:25"/>
in the beginning, what an opportune pretext, when all others failed, theſe non-conforming diſorders did furniſh to his Grace, for his laſt comeing amongſt us: But becauſe the letter, that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon purchaſed from his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> to his Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, doth not more hold forth, its true Author, in its unſuitableneſſe to his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent goodneſſe, then exhibit to the world the trueſt character of My L. Laud<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. <hi>goodneſſe and ſinceritie</hi> in all theſe affairs, in lines of his own drawing; I ſhall here ſett down at length, ſome paſſages of it:
But one of the principall reaſons of the keeping this ſeſſion of Par<hi rend="sup">lt</hi>, is to the end <q>
                  <hi>effectuall courſes,</hi> may be laid down, for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and puniſhing, the <hi>inſolent</hi> field-conventicles, and other <hi>ſeditious</hi> practiſes, which have ſince your laſt ſeſſion too much abounded: You are our witneſſes, what indulgences we have given, and with what lenitie, we have uſed, ſuch diſſenters, as would be peaceable, and how much our favours, have been abuſed. You have made many good laws, but ſtill they have <hi>failed</hi> in the <hi>execution</hi> againſt the <hi>contemners</hi> of the law; we muſt now <hi>once for all</hi> lay down ſuch <hi>ſolid and effectuall courſes,</hi> as the whole Kingdom <hi>may ſee,</hi> that we and you are both <hi>in earneſt,</hi> and that if <hi>fairneſſe</hi> will not, <hi>force muſt</hi> compell the refractorie to be peaceable, and obey the law. We have had frequent experience of your affection to our ſervice upon ſeverall occaſions, and therefore we are confident, you will <hi>eminentlie</hi> doe your dutie <hi>in this</hi> which doth <hi>ſo much</hi> concern, our authoritie and your own peace and quietneſſe: We leave the wayes and means to your own wiſdom, and we exſpect, you will lay down <hi>ſuch ſolid grounds</hi> &amp; take ſuch <hi>effectuall wayes,</hi> as may put an end, to theſe diſorders &amp; evidence to the world that our antient Kingdom of Scotland, is at quiet and united to us. We have inſtructed our Commiſſioner fullie in this &amp;c. &amp; he can well informe you of our conſtant affection to, &amp; care of, all the concerns, of that our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>which conſideration at this time,</hi> hath made us <hi>diſpence with him here when his ſervice was ſo uſefull to us</hi> &amp;c. and therefore you ſhall give him entire truſt, <hi>as we have hitherto done in all things.</hi>

            <p>The text is plain and needs no comment; I ſhall not ſay, vvith ſome Phanaticks, that if the Lord had not unexſpectedlie beat down to the earth, this perſecutour vvith his letters, breathing out
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:66384:26"/>
ſuch threatnings, and ſlaughter, our land might have again been turned, into a field of blood and confuſion: Nor vvill I poſitivelie affirm, that theſe minatorie ſtrains, vvere purpoſelie intended, for to overavv the nation, to a more complyant ſubmiſſion, to the introduction of a <hi>Service-booke,</hi> vvhich, it is vvell known, vvas both deſigned and prepared, and ſhould have been the great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, of his Grace his laſt comeing dovvn: But certainlie, vvho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever compares, the expreſſions of this letter, vvith all their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, viz. his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> benign clemencie to all innocent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, the Kingdomes unqueſtionable quiet, from all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances, its great and almoſt ſole diſtemper from My L.

Theſe have been his vvayes in the Church, ſo like, in every ſtep, to his act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the State, that they neither could have any better ſucceſſe, nor can receive a milder cenſure. But novv his Grace, haveing rode out this ſtorm of grievances, delivered himſelfe from Par<hi rend="sup">lts</hi>, and defeat all his enemies, in order to his return to Court, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves (as it is probable) to give the Kingdom a proofe, both of his ovvn free and unconſtrained benevolence, and alſo of his great povver and intereſt vvith his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, and therefore, there is a letter produced, from the King to his Councell, bearing, <hi>that his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> affection for us, makes him readie to embrace all occaſions, whereby he may witneſſe his zeal, to doe all things, which may be for our advantage, and eaſe; and that being informed, by his Commiſſioner, of ſome things which have been, &amp; ſtill are, troubleſom, &amp; burdenſom to us, he hath thought fit, in his royall bountie, and by his royall authoritie, to decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, his royall pleaſure for the diſcharging of all impoſitions, due before his reſtoration, all reſts of the taxation granted by the Par<hi rend="sup">lt</hi>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:66384:26"/>
preceeding the date of the letter: And laſtlie his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> doth grant, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall pardon and diſcharge, of all arbitrarie and pecuniall pains, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred before the date of the letter, extending even to thoſe againſt Conventicles, withdrawing from ordinances, diſorderlie baptiſmes and marriages, excepting nevertheleſſe, all capitall crimes, and ſentences of banishment, impriſonment, or confynement.</hi> Upon this letter, there being a proclamation voted and formed by the Councell, it was the next day made, with the ſolemnities of the Magiſtrats in their robes, the citizens in arms, ringing of bells, ſhooting of guns, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick feaſting, bonefires, &amp; all other ceremonies, that were uſed, in the moſt extraordinarie occaſions of joy: I ſhall not inſiſt on the peoples wonder, at the vain pomp, of theſe circumſtances, who could findenothing ſuitable in the ſubject; nor on the criticizings of the more maligne ſort, who regreting, that his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> affection &amp; zeal for our good, ſhould rather have been directed, by My L. Laud<hi rend="sup">s</hi>., ſcant and partiall ſuggeſtions then by the full and faithfull advice of his Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, obſerved firſt, that the exception in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, of the reſts of impoſitions, taxations and fynes, was infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie broader, then the releaſe it ſelfe, the countrey haveing, now for 13. years, been ſo vexed and haraſſed, for theſe things, that there is nothing left to be diſcharged, ſafe a few deſperat, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable remains. 2dly. that a generall pardon and diſcharge of arbitrarie and pecuniall pains, is an ordinarie grace, cuſtomarie to be granted in moſt Par<hi rend="sup">lts.</hi>, with ſuch a latitude as they think fit to give it. 3dly. that the extenſion of this pardon, <hi>even to Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> &amp;c. can have no <hi>emphaſis,</hi> unleſſe we ſuppoſe, conventicling &amp; non-conconforming, to be worſe then Sabbath-breaking, profane ſwearing, drinking, whoring, uſerie, extortion, and the like. 4thly. that the exception of <hi>banishments, impriſonments and confynments,</hi> wherein a few Phanatick miniſters are moſtlie concerned, appears to be an unſeaſonable reſerve of a peeviſh rigour: and 5thly. that the ſtyle of the proclamation viz. <hi>We with advice foreſaid, doe hereby ſtatute and enact, and accordinglie diſcharge, to our ſubjects, all reſts and aſſeſſements</hi> &amp;c. is not onely forced but more Parliamentarie then proper for ſuch edicts.</p>
            <p>But the thing, we rather remarque is, that juſt and important exception, moved againſt this letter and proclamation, by D. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltoun
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66384:27"/>
and others in Councell, viz. that D. Hammiltoun, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an undoubted right to the taxation 1633., by a contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his late Ma<hi rend="sup">tie.</hi> and James then Duke of Hammiltoun, and alſo by a commiſſion from his now Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi>, for ſecuritie and repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him of a conſiderable ſumme of money, the ſame could not be taken away in this ſummarie way, without lawfull hearing; upon which exception D. Hammiltoun (as he declared) did not inſiſt, for the value of the thing, but for obviating ſo dangerous a preparative, to every mans right and propertie; this diſcharge was overtur'd both by himſelfe, and others, during the ſitting of the Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi>, and if it had been proſecuted, that way, all mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, might have been conſidered, and alſo the countrey more effectuallie ſecured: But after rejecting of that method, to have made choiſe of this, was an introduceing of preſidents, of an evill aſpect: And yet albeit it was reſolved by the beſt Lawyers, in a writeing under their hands, that Duke Hammiltouns right was unqueſtionable, that the King in ſuch caſes <hi>utitur jure privati,</hi> and that by the fundamentall law of the Land, no mans right could be taken away ſummarlie by letter and proclamation (which plea was alſo confirmed by the ſuffrage of the Judges there preſent) nevertheleſſe it was with extream heat, and pain, that My L. Laud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could be induced to conſent to the reſerving of D. Hammiltouns right, as we finde it to be done, in the Proclamation. I have before mentioned, the letter impetrat, from his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Roug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heed town-Clerk of Edenburgh, and the offence which general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie it gave, becauſe of the invaſion of propertie and libertie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by threatned; but now, that My L. Laud, ſhould have again, and thus openlie, and avowedlie, relapſed into ſo pernicious an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, it doth manifeſtlie evince, a deſign of arbitrarineſſe, beyond the excuſes of either follie or fatalitie.</p>
            <p>And yet after this, &amp; all his other high &amp; ſtrange miſdemeanors, which I have hitherto related, My L. Laud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had the confidence, to preſent to the Councell, a letter of anſwer, to be ſubſcribed by them, and ſent up to the King, wherein thanks, are not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> gracious letter of releaſe, but alſo for his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines ſhewed by his Commiſſioner, to have rectified all our griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that were <hi>orderlie</hi> repreſented: I will not here take notice
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:66384:27"/>
of the <hi>diſſents,</hi> entered by a conſiderable part of the Councell, againſt ſuch a groundleſſe and impoſeing practice; as his Grace vvould delude the common people, <hi>by bells and bonefires,</hi> and other <hi>emptie and ridiculous shows,</hi> doth he alſo think, that men of underſtanding, vvill ſuffer their eyes to be put out; is it not enough, that he hath tyrranniſed over us, vvith ſo much pride and oppreſſion, but that he muſt morever offer violence to our ſenſes, and not onely obſtruct our prayers and cryes, to his Ma<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> for his compaſſion and help, but even endeavour to elicit flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering approbations, and applauſes for palliating and ſupporting theſe groſſe malverſations; for vvhich nevertheleſſe, it is beyond peradventure, that ſo ſoon as he ſhall be arrived at Court, he vvill think fit to ſecure himſelfe, as he hath alreadie done, for his farr inferior tranſgreſſions in England, by his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> remiſſion and pardon?</p>
            <p>Certainlie the free conſideration of theſe things, might ſtirre up, and raiſe every ingenuous ſpirit, to the higheſt meaſure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, did not his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> concern, and engagement therein, farr more povverfullie encline, to a dutifull regrete; who can obſerve, vvithout an aſtoniſhing griefe, this Kingdom, lately ſo overjoyed, for his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> reſtoration, and overflovving in all the poſſible expreſſions of the moſt loyall acknovvledgements, novv ſunke into the ſaddeſt depths, of mourning, and darkned, by reaſon of the vvitholding of the rayes of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> gracious countenance, vvith clouds of jealouſies, vvhich no man is vvilling to entertain, or yet able to diſſipat: And vvho can think, vvithout a moſt ſenſible affliction, that his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> moſt excellent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding &amp; moſt benign diſpoſition, in all other occaſions, ſhould in theſe matters of the higheſt conſequence, be ſo oddelie poſſeſt, vvith ſuch a ſtrange averſion, to hearken to, a moſt loyall Par<hi rend="sup">lt.</hi> and to be adviſed by his moſt affectionat ſubjects: And laſtly vvho can ſee, (vvithout a confuſion, and riſeing of paſſions, not to be expreſſed,) the D. of Laud., a perſon, ſo inſignificant for the advance of his Ma<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> ſervice, and, of late, become ſo extravagant and unacceptable, even in his privat deportment and ordinarie converſation vvith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
