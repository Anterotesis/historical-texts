            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Shall not neede (like
the most part of
Writers) to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the <hi>Subiect</hi>
which I deliuer. In that point I
am at ease. For <hi>Architecture,</hi>
can want no commendation, where
there are <hi>Noble Men,</hi> or <hi>Noble
mindes;</hi> I will therefore spend
this <hi>Preface,</hi> rather about those,
from whom I haue gathered my
knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For I am but a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
and disposer of other mens

               <pb facs="tcp:21018:3"/>
Our principall <hi>Master</hi> is <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truuius</hi>
and so I shall often call
him; who had this <hi>felicitie,</hi> that
he wrote when the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi>
was neere the pitch; Or at
least, when <hi>Augustus</hi> (who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
his endeauours) had some
meaning (if he were not mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken)
to bound the <hi>Monarchie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <note place="margin">Tacit. lib. 1. Annal.</note>
This I say was his good happe;
For in growing and enlarging
times, <hi>Artes</hi> are commonly
drowned in <hi>Action:</hi> But on the
other side, it was in truth an <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse,</hi>
to expresse himselfe
so ill, especially writing (as he did)
in a season of the ablest <hi>Pennes;</hi>
And <hi>his obscuritie</hi> had this
strange fortune; That though he
<pb facs="tcp:21018:3"/>
were best practised, and best fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by his owne <hi>Countrymen;</hi>
yet after the reuiuing and repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
of good <hi>Literature,</hi> (which
the combustions and tumults of
the <hi>middle Age</hi> had <hi>vnciuilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed)</hi>
he was best, or at least, first
vnderstood by <hi>strangers:</hi> For of
the <hi>Italians</hi> that tooke him in
hand, Those that were <hi>Grama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
seeme to haue wanted <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall</hi>
knowledge; and the
<hi>Mathematicians</hi> perhaps wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Gramer:</hi> till both were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
conioyned, in <hi>Leon-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tista
Alberti</hi> the <hi>Florentine,</hi>
whom I repute the first learned
<hi>Architect,</hi> beyond the <hi>Alpes;</hi>
But hee studied more indeede to
<pb facs="tcp:21018:4"/>
make himselfe an <hi>Author,</hi> then
to illustrate his <hi>Master.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
among his <hi>Commenters,</hi> I
must (for my priuate conceite)
yeild the chiefe praise vnto the
<hi>French,</hi> in <hi>Philander;</hi> and to the
high <hi>Germans,</hi> in <hi>Gualterus Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius:</hi>
who, besides his notes, hath
likewise published the most elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>translation,</hi> that I thinke is
extant in any <hi>vulgar</hi> speech of
the world: though not without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayling,
now and then, some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of <hi>Artificiall</hi> tearmes in his
<hi>owne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as I must likewise; For
if the <hi>Saxon,</hi> (our <hi>mother</hi>
tongue) did complaine; as iustly
(I doubt) in this point may the
<hi>Daughter: Languages,</hi> for the
<pb facs="tcp:21018:4"/>
most part in tearmes of <hi>Art</hi> and
<hi>Erudition,</hi> retayning their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
pouertie, and rather growing
rich and abundant, in comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
phrases and such froth.
Touching diuers <hi>moderne</hi> men
that haue written out of meere pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
I shall giue them their due,
vpon occasion.</p>
            <p>And now, after this short <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
of others, I would faine satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
an <hi>Obiection</hi> or two, which
seeme to lie somewhat heauily vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my selfe; It will be said that I
handle an <hi>Art,</hi> no way suteable
either to my <hi>employments,</hi> or to
my <hi>fortune.</hi> And so I shall
stand charged, both with <hi>Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
and with <hi>Impertinency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21018:5"/>
To the <hi>First</hi> I answere, that
though by the euer acknowledged
goodnesse of my most <hi>deare</hi> and
<hi>gracious SOVERAIGNE;</hi>
and by his long indulgent tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my defects. I haue borne
abroad some part of his <hi>ciuill</hi>
seruice; yet when I came home,
and was againe resolued into mine
owne simplicitie, I found it fitter
for my <hi>Pen</hi> (at least in this first
publique aduenture) to deale with
these plaine <hi>compilements,</hi> and
tractable <hi>Materials;</hi> then with the
<hi>Laberynthes</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> of
<hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>States;</hi> And lesse
presumption for mee, who haue
long contemplated a famous <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi>
to write now of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21018:5"/>
then it was anciently for
<note n="*" place="margin">Aristot. 2. lib. Politi. cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Hippodamus</hi> the <hi>Milesian,</hi> to
write of <hi>Republiques,</hi> who was
himselfe but an <hi>Architect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Second,</hi> I must shrinke
vp my shoulders, as I haue learn'd
abroad, and confesse indeed, that
my fortune is very vnable to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie,</hi>
and <hi>actuate</hi> my <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
in this <hi>Art,</hi> which yet in
trueth, made mee the rather euen
from my very disabilitie, take en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to hope; that my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Labour,</hi> would find the more
fauour with others, since it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
for no mans <hi>sake,</hi> lesse
then mine <hi>owne.</hi> And with that
cofidence, I fel into these thoughts;
Of which, there were two wayes to
<pb facs="tcp:21018:6"/>
be deliuered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The one <hi>Historical,</hi>
by description of the principall
<hi>workes,</hi> performed already in
good part, by <hi>Giorgio Vassari</hi> in
the liues of <hi>Architects:</hi> The
other <hi>Logicall,</hi> by casting the
<hi>rules</hi> and cautions of this Art, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some comportable <hi>Methode:</hi>
whereof I haue made choice; not
onely as the shortest and most <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall;</hi>
but indeed as the <hi>soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest.</hi>
For though in practicall
<hi>knowledges,</hi> euery complete <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
may beare the credite of a

require the more exquisite caution;

vaine: Some are plainely <hi>Oeconomical;</hi>
As that the <hi>Seate</hi> be well watered, and

That it lie not too farre, from some

<hi>Line</hi> of his owne <hi>Possessions:</hi> So there
is a <hi>Lordship</hi> likewise of the <hi>Eye</hi> which
being a raunging, and Imperious, and
(I might say) an <hi>vsurping Sence,</hi> can
indure no narrow <hi>circumscription;</hi> but
must be fedde, both with extent and
varietie. Yet on the other side, I finde
vaste and indefinite viewes which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21018:8"/>
drowne all apprehension of the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
<hi>Obiects,</hi> condemned, by good
Authors, as if thereby some part of the
pleasure (whereof we speake) did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
Lastly, I remember a priuate
<hi>Caution,</hi> which I know not well how
to sort, vnlesse I should call it <hi>Political.</hi>
By no meanes, to build too neere a
great <hi>Neighbour;</hi> which were in truth
to bee as vnfortunately seated on the
earth, as <hi>Mercurie</hi> is in the Heauens, for
the most part, euer in <hi>combustion,</hi> or <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuritie,</hi>
vnder brighter beames then his
owne.</p>
            <p>From these seuerall <hi>Knowledges</hi> as I
haue said,<note n="*" place="margin">Ioannes Heurnius Instit: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicin: lib. 7. cap. 2.</note> and perhaps from some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe <hi>Architects</hi> deriue their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
about election of <hi>Seats:</hi> wherin
I haue not beene so seuere, as a great
Scholer of our time, who precisely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayneth
a perfect <hi>Scituation,</hi> at least for
the maine point of health, <hi>Ad locum
contra quem Solradios suos fundit cum sub
Ariete oritur,</hi> That is, in a word hee
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21018:9"/>
would haue the first <hi>salutation</hi> of the
<hi>Spring.</hi> But such <hi>Notes</hi> as these, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
we finde them in graue or slight
Authors, are to my conceite rather
<hi>wishes</hi> then <hi>Precepts;</hi> and in that quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
I will passe them ouer. Yet I must
withall say that in the <hi>seating</hi> of our
selues (which as a kinde of <hi>Marriage</hi>
to a <hi>Place) Builders</hi> should bee as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect
as <hi>Wooers;</hi> lest when all is
done that <hi>Doome</hi> befall vs,<note place="margin">Opidum quidem aedificatum eleganter sed impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denter positum.</note> which our
Master doth lay vpon <hi>Mitylene: A
Towne</hi> in truth (saith hee) <hi>finely built,
but foolishly planted.</hi> And so much
touching that, which I termed the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Posture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next in Order is the placing of
the <hi>Parts;</hi> About which (to leaue as
little as I may in my present labour,
vnto <hi>Fancie,</hi> which is wilde and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar)
I will propound a Rule of mine
owne Collection, vpon which I fell in
this maner. I had noted, that all <hi>Arte</hi>
was then in truest perfection, when it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21018:9"/>
might bee reduced to some naturall
<hi>Principle.</hi> For what are the most iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>Artisans</hi> but the <hi>Mimiques</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
This led me to contemplate the
Fabrique of our owne Bodies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>High Architect</hi> of the world, had
displaied such skill, as did stupifie, all
humane reason. There I found the
<hi>Hart</hi> as the fountaine of Life placed
about the Middle, for the more equall
communication of the vitall spirits.
The <hi>Eyes</hi> seated aloft, that they might
describe the greater Circle within their
view. The <hi>Armes</hi> proiected on each
side, for ease of reaching. Briefly (not
to loose our selues in this sweet specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation)
it plainely appeareth, as a
Maxime drawne from the Diuine
light; That the <hi>Place</hi> of euery part, is
to be determined by the <hi>Vse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, from naturall <hi>structure,</hi> to
proceed to Artificiall; and in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
things, to preserue some <hi>Image</hi> of
the excellentest. Let all the principall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21018:10"/>
chambers of <hi>Delight,</hi> All <hi>Studies</hi> and
<hi>Libraries,</hi> be towards the <hi>East:</hi> For the
Morning is a friend to the Muses. All
Offices that require heat, as <hi>Kitchins,
Stillatories, Stoues,</hi> roomes for <hi>Baking,
Brewing, Washing,</hi> or the like, would be
<hi>Meridionall.</hi> All that need a coole and
fresh temper, as <hi>Cellers, Pantries, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
Granaries,</hi> to the <hi>North.</hi> To the
same side likewise, all that are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for gentle Motion, as <hi>Galleries,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in warme Climes, or that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
require a steadie and vnuariable
light, as <hi>Pinacothecia</hi> (saith <hi>Vitruuius</hi>) by
which he intendeth, (if I may guesse
at his Greeke, as wee must doe often
euen at his Latine) certaine <hi>Reposito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
for workes of rarity in Picture or
other Arts, by the Italians called <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioli,</hi>
which at any other Quarter,
where the course of the <hi>Sunne</hi> doth
diuersifie the <hi>Shadowes,</hi> would
loose much of their grace. And by this
Rule hauing alwayes regarde to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21018:10"/>
               <hi>Vse,</hi> any other Part may bee fitly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated.</p>
            <p>I must here not omit to note that
the Ancient <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the <hi>Romanes</hi>
by their example in their buildings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
where the <hi>Seat</hi> was free, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Religiously scituate the <hi>Front</hi> of
their houses, towards the South; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
that the Masters <hi>Eye,</hi> when hee
came home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might not be dazeled, or
that being illustrated, by the <hi>Sunne,</hi> it
might yeeld the more gracefull <hi>Aspect;</hi>
or some such reason. But from this,
the Moderne Italians doe varie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I shall speake more in another place.
Let thus much suffice at the present for
the <hi>Position</hi> of the seuerall <hi>Members,</hi>
wherein must bee had as our Author
doth often insinuate, and especially
<hi>lib. 6. cap. 10.</hi> a singular regard, to the
nature of the <hi>Region:</hi> Euery Nation,
being tyed aboue al Rules whatsoeuer,
to a discretion, of prouiding against
their owne <hi>Inconueniences:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21018:11"/>
a good <hi>Parler</hi> in Aegypt would
perchance make a good <hi>Celler</hi> in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>There now followeth the second
Branch of the generall <hi>Section</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Worke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Worke,</hi> I will first consider the
principall parts, and afterwards the
Accessorie, or <hi>Ornaments;</hi> And in the
Principall, first the Preparation of the
<hi>Materials,</hi> and then the Disposition,
which is the <hi>Forme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, concerning the <hi>Materiall</hi> part;
Although surely, it cannot disgrace an
<hi>Architect,</hi> which doth so well become
a Philosopher, to looke into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Wood:</hi> as that Firre
Trees, Cypresses, Cedars, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Aereall</hi> aspiring <hi>Plants,</hi> being by a
kinde of naturall rigour (which in a
Man I would call pride) inflexible
downewards are thereby fittest for
<hi>Posts</hi> or <hi>Pillars</hi> or such vpright vse; that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21018:11"/>
on the other side, Oake, and the like
true hartie Timber being strong in all
positions, may bee better trusted in
crosse and trauerse worke, for <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi>
or guirding and binding <hi>beames,</hi>
as they tearme them. And so likewise
to obserue of <hi>Stone,</hi> that some, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
within, and other to beare <hi>Weather:</hi>
Nay, to descend lower euen to examine
<hi>Sand</hi> and <hi>Lyme,</hi> and <hi>Clay</hi> (of all which
things <hi>Vitruuius</hi> hath discoursed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any daintines, &amp; the most of new
Writers) I say though the <hi>Speculatiue</hi>
part of such knowledge be <hi>liberall:</hi> yet
to redeeme this Profession, and my
present paynes, from indignitie; I must
heere remember that to choose and
sort the <hi>materials,</hi> for euery part of the
<hi>Fabrique,</hi> is a Dutie more proper to a
second <hi>Superintendent,</hi> ouer all the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Artisans called (as I take it) by our
Author, <hi>Officinator lib. 6. cap. 11.</hi> and in
that Place expressely distinguished,
from the <hi>Architect,</hi> whose glory doth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21018:12"/>
more consist, in the Designement and
<hi>Idea</hi> of the whole <hi>Worke,</hi> and his truest
ambition should be to make the <hi>Forme,</hi>
which is the nobler Part (as it were)
triumph ouer the <hi>Matter:</hi> whereof I
cannot but mention by the way, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne
Paterne, namely the Church of
<hi>Santa Giustina</hi> in <hi>Padoua:</hi> In truth a
sound piece of good Art, where the
<hi>Materials</hi> being but ordinarie stone,
without any garnishment of sculpture,
doe yet rauish the Beholder, (and hee
knowes not how) by a secret <hi>Harmony</hi>
in the <hi>Proportions.</hi> And this indeede is
that end, at which in some degree, we
should ayme euen in the priuatest
workes: whereunto though I make
haste, yet let me first collect, a few of
the least triuiall cautions, belonging to
the <hi>Materiall Prouision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leon Batista Alberti,</hi> is so curious,
as to wish all the <hi>Timber,</hi> cut out of the
same <hi>Forrest,</hi> and al the <hi>Stone,</hi> out of the
same <hi>Quarrie.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21018:12"/>
Philibert del'Orme</hi> the French Architect
goes yet somewhat further, and would
haue the <hi>Lyme</hi> made of the very same
<hi>Stone,</hi> which wee intend to imploy in
the <hi>Worke;</hi> as belike imagining that
they will sympathize and ioyne the
better, by a kinde of <hi>Originall</hi> kindred.
But such conceits as these seeme some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
too fine among this <hi>Rubbage,</hi>
though I doe not produce them in
sport. For surely the like agreements
of nature, may haue oftentimes a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
application to Art. Alwayes it
must be confessed, that to make <hi>Lyme</hi>
without any great choyce of refuse
stuffe, as we commonly do, is an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
error, of no small moment in our
Buildings. Whereas the <hi>Italians</hi> at this
day, and much more the <hi>Ancients</hi> did
burne their firmest <hi>stone,</hi> and euen frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Marble</hi> where it was copious,
which in time became almost <hi>Marble</hi>
againe, or at least of indissoluble duri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as appeareth in the standing <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21018:13"/>
I must here not omit, while I am
speaking of this part, a certain forme of
<hi>Bricke</hi> described by <hi>Daniele Barbaro Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi>
of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> in the largest Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Commentary vpon <hi>Vitruuius.</hi>
The Figure triangular, euery side a
foot long, and some inch and a halfe
thicke, which he doth commend vnto
vs for many good conditions: As that
they are more commodious in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
of lesse expence, of fayrer
show, adding much beautie &amp; strength
to the <hi>Murall Angles,</hi> where they fall
gracefully into an indented <hi>Worke:</hi> so
as I should wonder that wee haue not
taken them into vse, being propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a man of good authoritie in
this knowledge; but that all Nations
doe start at <hi>Nouelties,</hi> and are indeede
maried to their owne <hi>Moulds.</hi> Into this
place might aptly fall a doubt, which
some haue wel moued; whether the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Italians</hi> did burne their <hi>Bricke</hi> or
no; which a passage or two in <hi>Vitruuius</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:21018:13"/>
hath left ambiguous. Surely where
the <hi>Naturall</hi> heat is strong enough, to
supply the <hi>Artificiall,</hi> it were but a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
folly to multiply both <hi>Labour</hi>
and <hi>Expence.</hi> And it is besides very
probable, that those <hi>Materials</hi> with a
kindely and temperate heate would
proue fairer, smoother, and lesse distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
then with a violent: Onely, they
suffer two exceptions. First, that by
such a gentle drying much time will
bee lost which might otherwise bee
employed in compiling. Next, That
they will want a certaine sucking and
soaking <hi>Thirstinesse,</hi> or a fiery appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to drinke in the <hi>Lime,</hi> which must
knit the <hi>Fabrique.</hi> But this question
may be confined to the <hi>South,</hi> where
there is more Sunne and patience. I
will therefore not hinder my course,
with this incident scruple, but close
that part which I haue now in hand,
about the <hi>Materialls,</hi> with a principall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:21018:14"/>
caution: That sufficient <hi>Stuffe</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>
bee euer ready before we beginne:
For when wee build now a piece, and
then another by <hi>Fits,</hi> the <hi>Worke</hi> dries
and sinkes vnequally, whereby the
<hi>Walles</hi> growe full of <hi>Chinques,</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices;</hi>
Therefore such pawsings are
well reprooued by <hi>Palladio, lib. 1. cap. 1.</hi>
and by all other. And so hauing glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
these few remembrances, touching
the preparation of the <hi>Matter,</hi> I may
now proceede to the <hi>Disposition</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which must forme the <hi>Worke.</hi> In
the <hi>Forme,</hi> as I did in the <hi>Seate,</hi> I will
first consider the generall <hi>Figuration,</hi>
and then the seuerall <hi>Members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Figures</hi> are either <hi>simple</hi> or <hi>Mixed.</hi>
The simple be either <hi>Circular</hi> or <hi>Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi>
And of Circular, either <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate,</hi>
or <hi>Deficient,</hi> as <hi>Ouals,</hi> with
which kindes I will bee contented,
though the Distribution might bee
more curious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:21018:14"/>
Now the exact <hi>Circle</hi> is in truth a
Figure, which for our purpose hath
many fit and eminent properties; as
fitnesse, for Commodity and Receit,
being the most capable; fitnesse for
strength and duration, being the most
vnited in his parts; Fitnesse for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and delight, as imitating the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall
<hi>Orbes,</hi> and the vniuersall <hi>Forme.</hi>
And it seemes, besides, to haue the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of <hi>Nature,</hi> when shee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by <hi>Instinct,</hi> which is her secret
Schoole: For birds doe build their
nests <hi>Spherically:</hi> But notwithstanding
these Attributes, it is in truth a very
vnprofitable Figure in priuate <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briques,</hi>
as being of allother the most
chargeable, and much roome lost in
the bending of the <hi>Walles,</hi> when it
comes to bee diuided: besides an ill
distribution of light, except from the
<hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Roofe.</hi> So as anciently it
was not vsual, saue in their <hi>Temples</hi> and
<hi>Amphi-Theaters,</hi> which needed no
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21018:15"/>
Compartitions. The <hi>Ouals</hi> and other
imperfect circular Formes, haue the
same exceptions, and lesse benefite of
capacity: So as there remaynes to bee
considered in this generall suruey of
<hi>Figures,</hi> the <hi>Angular,</hi> and the <hi>Mixed</hi> of
both. Touching the <hi>Angular,</hi> it may
perchance sound somewhat strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but it is a true obseruation, that
this <hi>Art</hi> doth neither loue many <hi>Angles</hi>
nor few. For first, the <hi>Triangle</hi> which
hath the fewest sides and corners, is of
all other the most condemned, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed both incapable and infirme
(wherof the reason shall be afterwards
rendred) and likewise vnresoluable
into any other regular <hi>Forme</hi> then it
selfe, in the inward <hi>Partitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for Figures of fiue, six, seuen, or
more <hi>Angles;</hi> They are surely fitter
for <hi>Militar Architecture,</hi> where the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
may be layed out at the <hi>Corners,</hi>
and the sides serue for <hi>Curtaines,</hi> then
for ciuill vse; though I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21018:15"/>
of that famous Piece at <hi>Caprarola,</hi>
belonging to the house of <hi>Farnese,</hi>
cast by <hi>Baroccio</hi> into the forme of a
<hi>Pentagone,</hi> with a <hi>Circle</hi> inscribed,
where the <hi>Architect</hi> did ingeniously
wrestle with diuers inconueniences in
disposing of the <hi>Lights,</hi> and in sauing
the vacuities. But as designes of such
nature doe more ayme at Rarity, then
Commoditie: so for my part I had
rather admire them, then commend
them.</p>
            <p>These things considered, we are
both by the Precepts and by the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
of the best Builders, to resolue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Rectangular Squares,</hi> as a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
too few, and too many Angles;
and through the equall inclination of
the sides (which make the right An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle)
stronger then the <hi>Rhombe,</hi> or <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senge,</hi>
or any other irregular <hi>Square.</hi>
But whether the exact <hi>Quadrat,</hi> or the
long <hi>Square</hi> be the better, I finde not
well determined, though in mine
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21018:16"/>
owne conceit I must preferre the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
prouided that the <hi>Length</hi> doe not
exceede the <hi>Latitude</hi> aboue one third
part, which would diminish the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the <hi>Aspect,</hi> as shall appeare when
I come to speake of <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of mixed Figures, partly <hi>Circular,</hi>
and partly <hi>Angular,</hi> I shall neede to say
nothing; because hauing handled the
simple already, the mixed according
to their composition, doe participate
of the same respects. Onely against
these, there is a proper <hi>Obiection,</hi> that
they offend <hi>Vniformity:</hi> Whereof I
am therefore opportunely induced to
say somewhat, as farre as shal concerne
the outward <hi>Aspect,</hi> which is now in
Discourse.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Architecture,</hi> there may seem to be
two opposite affectations, <hi>Vniformitie</hi>
and <hi>Varietie,</hi> which yet will very well
suffer a good reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilement, as we may
see in the great Paterne of <hi>Nature,</hi> to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21018:16"/>
which I must often resort: For sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there can be no <hi>Structure,</hi> more vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
then our <hi>Bodies</hi> in the whole <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration:</hi>
Each side, agreeing with the
other, both in the number, in the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
and in the measure of the Parts:
And yet some are round, as the <hi>Armes,</hi>
some flat, as the <hi>Hands,</hi> some promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and some more retired: So as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Mater, wee see that <hi>Diuersitie</hi>
doth not destroy <hi>Vniformitie,</hi> and that
the Limmes of a noble <hi>Fabrique,</hi> may
bee correspondent enough, though
they be various; Prouided alwayes, that
we doe not runne into certaine extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagant
Inuentions, whereof I shall
speake more largely, when I come to
the parting and casting of the whole
<hi>Worke.</hi> We ought likewise to auoyde
Enormous heights of sixe or seuen
<hi>Stories,</hi> as well as irregular <hi>Formes;</hi> and
the contrary fault of low-distended
<hi>Fronts,</hi> is as vnseemely: Or againe,
when the <hi>Face</hi> of the Building, is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21018:17"/>
and the <hi>Flank</hi> deepe; To all which
extreames, some particular Nations, or
Townes, are subiect, whose Names
may be ciuilly spared: And so much
for the generall <hi>Figuration,</hi> or <hi>Aspect of</hi>
the <hi>Worke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning the Parts in Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie.
All the parts of euery <hi>Fabrique,</hi>
may be comprised vnder fiue Heads,
which Diuision I receiue from <hi>Batista
Alberti,</hi> to doe him right. And they
be these.</p>

all the mirth in the House: Therefore,
that wee may found our Habitation

which we will Build; and then the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfillings,
or <hi>Substruction,</hi> as the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
did call it: For the former, we
haue a generall precept in <hi>Vitruuius</hi>
twice precisely repeated by him, as a

seeme) to sound somewhat lower.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Italians</hi> doe prescribe, that
when they haue chosen the <hi>Floore,</hi> or
Plot, and laid out the Limits of the
<hi>Worke,</hi> wee should first of all Digge
<hi>Wels</hi> and <hi>Cesternes,</hi> and other vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducts
and conueiances, for the
<hi>Suillage</hi> of the House, whence may arise
a double benefit, for both the Nature

<hi>Vapours,</hi> as hauing otherwise no issu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:21018:18"/>
might peraduenture shake the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
This is enough for the naturall
<hi>Grounding,</hi> which though it bee not a
part of the solid <hi>Fabrique,</hi> yet here was
the fittest place to handle it.</p>
            <p>There followeth the <hi>Substruction,</hi> or
Ground-worke of the whole <hi>Edifice,</hi>
which must sustaine the <hi>Walles;</hi> and
this is a kinde of <hi>Artificiall</hi> foundation,
as the other was <hi>Natural.</hi> About which
these are the chiefe Remembrances.
First, that the bottome be precisely le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
where the <hi>Italians</hi> therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
lay a platforme of good Bord;
Then that the lowest <hi>Ledge</hi> or <hi>Row</hi> be
meerely of <hi>Stone,</hi> and the broader the
better, closely layd without <hi>Morter,</hi>
which is a generall caution for all
parts in Building, that are contiguous
to <hi>Bord</hi> or <hi>Timber,</hi> because <hi>Lime</hi> amd
<hi>Wood</hi> are insociable, and if any where
vnfit confiners, then most especially in
the <hi>Foundation.</hi> Thirdly, that the
bredth of the <hi>Substruction</hi> bee at least
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21018:19"/>
double to the <hi>insistent Wall,</hi> and more
or lesse, as the weight of the <hi>Fabrique</hi>
shall require; for as I must againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate,
<hi>Discretion</hi> may be freer then <hi>Art.</hi>
Lastly, I finde in some a curious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
that the <hi>Materials</hi> below, be layd
as they grew in the <hi>Quarrie,</hi> supposing
them belike to haue most strength in
their <hi>Naturall</hi> and <hi>Habituall</hi> Posture.
For as <hi>Philippe de l'Orme</hi> obserueth, the
breaking or yeelding of a stone in this
part, but the bredth of the backe of a
knife, will make a <hi>Cleft</hi> of more then
half a foot in the <hi>Fabrique</hi> aloft, So im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
are <hi>Fundamentall errors.</hi> Among
which notes I haue sayd nothing of
<hi>Pallification,</hi> or <hi>Pyling</hi> of the <hi>Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plot,</hi>
commanded by <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> when
we build vpon a moist or marshy soile,
because that were an error in the first
choyce. And therefore all <hi>Seats</hi> that
must vse such prouision below (as <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
for an eminent example) would
perhaps vpon good enquiry, be found
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:21018:19"/>
to haue beene at first chosen by the
counsell of <hi>Necessity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Foundation</hi> being sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and the <hi>Substruction</hi> layd, wee
must next speake of the <hi>Wals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wals</hi> are either entire and continuall,
or intermitted; and the <hi>Intermissions</hi> be
either <hi>Pillars</hi> or <hi>Pylasters;</hi> for here I had
rather handle them, then as some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe, among <hi>Ornaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The entire <hi>Muring</hi> is by Writers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly
distinguished: By some, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the quality of the <hi>Materials,</hi> as
either Stone or Brick, &amp;c. where, by the
way, let me note, that to build <hi>Wals</hi> and
greater Workes of <hi>Flint,</hi> whereof wee
want not example in our <hi>Iland,</hi> &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the <hi>Prouince</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> was
(as I conceiue) meerly vnknown to the
<hi>Ancients,</hi> who obseruing in that <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall,</hi>
a kinde of <hi>Metalicall</hi> Nature, or at
least a <hi>Fusibility,</hi> seeme to haue resolued
it into nobler vse; an Art now vtterly
lost, or perchance kept vp by a few <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks.</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:21018:20"/>
Some againe doe not so much
consider the quality, as the <hi>Position</hi> of
the sayd <hi>Materials:</hi> As when Bricke or
squared stones are laid in their lengths
with sides and heads together, or their
points conjoyned like a <hi>Networke</hi> (for
so <hi>Vitruuius</hi> doth call it <hi>reticulatum opus)</hi>
of familiar vse (as it should seeme) in
his Age, though afterwards growne
out of request, euen perhaps for that
subtill speculation which hee himselfe
toucheth; because so layd, they are
more apt in swagging down, to pierce
with their points, then in the jacent
Posture, and so to creuice the <hi>Wall:</hi>
But to leaue such cares to the meaner
Artificers, the more essentiall are
these.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Walles</hi> bee most exactly
perpendicular to the <hi>Ground-worke:</hi>
for the right <hi>Angle</hi> (thereon depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding)
is the true cause of all <hi>Stability;</hi>
both in Artificiall and Naturall posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
A man likewise standing fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21018:20"/>
when he stands vprightest. That
the massiest and heauiest <hi>Materials</hi> bee
the lowest, as fitter to beare, then to
be borne. That the <hi>Worke</hi> as it riseth,
diminish in <hi>thicknesse</hi> proportionally,
for ease both of weight, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
That certaine courses or <hi>Led<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
of more strength then the rest, be
interlayed like <hi>Bones,</hi> to sustaine the
<hi>Fabrique</hi> from totall ruine, if the vnder
parts should decay. Lastly, that the
<hi>Angles</hi> bee firmely bound, which are
the <hi>Nerues</hi> of the whole <hi>Edifice,</hi> and
therefore are commonly fortified by
the <hi>Italians,</hi> euen in their Bricke buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
on each side of the corners, with
well squared stone, yeelding both
strength and grace And so much tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the entire or solid <hi>Wall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The intermissions (as hath beene
sayd) are either by <hi>Pillars,</hi> or <hi>Pylasters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pillers</hi> which we may likewise call
<hi>Columnes</hi> (for the word among Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
is almost naturallized) I could
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21018:21"/>
distinguish into <hi>Simple</hi> &amp; <hi>Compounded.</hi>
But (to tread the beaten and plainest
way) there are fiue <hi>Orders</hi> of Pillers,
according to their dignity and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
thus marshalled:
<list>
                  <item>The <hi>Tuscan.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The <hi>Dorique.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The <hi>Ionique.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>The <hi>Corinthian.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Compound Order,</hi> or as
some call it the <hi>Roman,</hi> others more
generally the <hi>Italian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which fiue <hi>Orders</hi> I will first
consider their <hi>Communities,</hi> and then
their <hi>Proprieties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Communities</hi> (as farre as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue)
are principally three. First, they
are all <hi>Round;</hi> for though some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<hi>Columna Atticurges</hi> mentioned by
<hi>Vitruuius, lib. 3. cap. 3.</hi> to haue beene a
squared Pillar, yet wee must passe it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
as irregular, neuer receiued among
these <hi>Orders,</hi> no more then certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
licentious inuentions, of <hi>Wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:21018:21"/>
and <hi>Vined,</hi> and <hi>Figured Columnes,</hi>
which our Author himselfe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
being in his whole Booke a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
enemy to <hi>Fancies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, they are all <hi>Diminished,</hi>
or <hi>Contracted</hi> insensibly, more or lesse,
according to the proportion of their
heights, from one third part of the
whole <hi>Shaft</hi> vpwards, which <hi>Philander</hi>
doth prescribe by his owne precise
measuring of the Ancient remainders,
as the most gracefull <hi>Diminution.</hi> And
here I must take leaue to blame a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
growne (I know not how) in
certaine places too familiar, of making
<hi>Pillars</hi> swell in the middle, as if they
were sicke of some <hi>Tympany,</hi> or <hi>Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,</hi>
without any Authentique Paterne
or Rule, to my knowledge, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely
to the very iudgement of
sight. True it is that in <hi>Vitruuius, lib.</hi>
3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. wee finde these words, <hi>De ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectione,
quae adijcitur in medijs Columnis,
quaa apud Grecos <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

seemeth to haue giuen some cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to this error. But of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
there made, as of diuerse other
elsewhere, our Master hath fayled vs,
either by slip of memory, or iniury of
time, and so wee are left in the darke.
Alwayes sure I am, that besides the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of example which it wanteth,
It is likewise contrary to the Originall
and Naturall <hi>Type,</hi> in <hi>Trees,</hi> which at
first was imitated in <hi>Pillars,</hi> as <hi>Vitruui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
himselfe obserueth, <hi>lib. 5. cap. 1.</hi> For
who euer saw any <hi>Cypresse,</hi> or <hi>Pine,</hi>
(which are there alledged) small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and aboue, and tumerous in the
middle, vnlesse it were some diseased
Plant, as Nature (though otherwise the
comliest <hi>Mistresse)</hi> hath now and then
her deformities and <hi>Irregularities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, they haue all their <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settings,</hi>
or <hi>Pedistals,</hi> in height a third
part of the whole <hi>Columne,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Capitall;</hi> and their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21018:22"/>
vpper Adiuncts, as <hi>Architraue, Frize,</hi>
and <hi>Cornice,</hi> a fourth part of the sayd
Pillar; which rule of singular vse and
facility I find setled by <hi>Iacobo Baroccio,</hi>
and hold him a more credible Author,
as a man that most intended this
piece, then any that vary from him in
those <hi>Dimentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are their most considerable
<hi>Communities</hi> and agreements.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Proprieties</hi> or <hi>Distinctions</hi> will
best appeare by some reasonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of them all, together with
their <hi>Architraues, Frizes,</hi> and <hi>Corni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
as they are vsually handled.</p>
            <p>First therefore the <hi>Tuscan</hi> is a plain,
massie, rurall Pillar, resembling some
sturdy well-limmed Labourer, homely
clad, in which kinde of comparisons
<hi>Vitruuius</hi> himselfe seemeth to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<hi>lib. 4. cap. 1.</hi> The length thereof
shall be six <hi>Diameters,</hi> of the grossest of
the Pillar below. Of all proportions,
in truth, the most naturall; For our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21018:23"/>
Author tells vs, <hi>lib. 3. cap. 1.</hi> that the
foote of a man is the sixt part of his
bodie in ordinary measure, and <hi>Man</hi>
himselfe, according to the saying of
<hi>Protagoras</hi> (which <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
vouchsafe to celebrate) is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: as it were the <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type</hi>
of all exact <hi>Symmetrie,</hi> which we
haue had other occasion to touch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
This <hi>Columne</hi> I haue by good
warrant called <hi>Rurall, Vitru. cap. 2. lib. 3.</hi>
And therefore we need not consider
his rank among the rest. The distance
or <hi>Intercolumniation</hi> (which word Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers
doe vsually borrow) may bee
neere foure of his owne <hi>Diameters,</hi>
because the <hi>Materials</hi> commonly layd
ouer this Pillar, were rather of wood
then stone; through the lightnesse
whereof the <hi>Architraue</hi> could not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
though thinnely supported, nor
the <hi>Columne</hi> it selfe being so substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall.
The <hi>Contraction</hi> aloft shall be
(according to the most receiued prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice)
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21018:23"/>
one fourth part of his thicknesse
below. To conclude, (for I intend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as much as shall serue for a due Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishment,
and not to delineate
every petty member) the <hi>Tuscan</hi> is of
all the rudest Pillar, and his principall
Character <hi>Simplicity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dorique Order</hi> is the grauest
that hath beene receiued into ciuill
vse, preseruing, in comparison of those
that follow, a more <hi>Masculine Aspect,</hi>
and litle trimmer then the <hi>Tuscan</hi> that
went before, saue a sober garnishment
now and then of <hi>Lions heads</hi> in the
<hi>Cornice,</hi> and of <hi>Triglyphs</hi> and <hi>Metopes</hi>
alwayes in the <hi>Frize.</hi> Sometimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
but rarely, chaneled, and a little
slight sculpture about the <hi>Hypotrache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi>
or <hi>Necke</hi> vnder the <hi>Capitall.</hi> The
length, seuen <hi>Diameters.</hi> His ranke or
degree, is the lowest by all <hi>Congruity,</hi>
as being more massie then the other
three, and consequently abler to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
The <hi>Intercolumniation,</hi> thrice as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21018:24"/>
much as his thicknesse below. The
<hi>Contraction</hi> aloft, one fift of the same
measure. To discerne him, will bee a
peece rather of good <hi>Heraldry,</hi> then of
<hi>Architecture:</hi> For he is best knowne by
his place, when he is in company, and
by the peculiar ornament of his <hi>Frize</hi>
(before mentioned) when he is alone.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ionique Order</hi> doth represent a
kinde of Feminine slendernesse, yet
saith <hi>Vitruuius,</hi> not like a light House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,
but in a decent dressing, hath
much of the <hi>Matrone.</hi> The length
eight <hi>Diameters.</hi> In degree as in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantialnesse,
next aboue the <hi>Dorique,</hi>
sustayning the third, and adorning the
second Story. The <hi>Intercolumniation</hi>
two of his owne <hi>Diameters.</hi> The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi>
one sixt part. Best knowne by
his trimmings, for the bodie of this
<hi>Columne</hi> is perpetually chaneled, like
a thicke plighted Gowne. The <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi>
dressed on each side, not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
womens Wires, in a spirall wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21018:24"/>
which they call the <hi>Ionian Voluta.</hi>
The <hi>Cornice</hi> indented. The <hi>Frize</hi> swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
like a pillow; And therefore by
<hi>Vitruuius,</hi> not vnelegantly tearmed
<hi>Puluinata.</hi> These are his best <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Corinthian,</hi> is a <hi>Columne,</hi> laciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
decked like a Curtezane, and
therein much participating (as all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions
doe) of the place where they
were first borne: <hi>Corinthe</hi> hauing been
without controuersie one of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonest
Townes in the world. This
<hi>Order</hi> is of nine <hi>Diameters.</hi> His degree,
one Stage aboue the <hi>Ionique,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the highest of the simple <hi>Orders.</hi>
The <hi>Intercolumniation</hi> two of his <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters,</hi>
and a fourth part more, which
is of all other the comeliest distance.
The <hi>Contraction</hi> one seuenth Part. In
the <hi>Cornice</hi> both <hi>Dentelli</hi> and <hi>Modigli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni.</hi>
The <hi>Frize,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans call them Teeth and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonzes.</note> adorned with all kinds
of <hi>Figures</hi> and various Compartments
at Pleasure. The <hi>Capitall,</hi> cut into the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21018:25"/>
beautifullest leafe, that Nature doth
yeeld, which surely next the <hi>Aconitum
Pardalianches</hi> (reiected perchance as
an ominous <hi>Plant)</hi> is the <hi>Acanthus
or Branca Vrsina</hi> though <hi>Vitruuius</hi>
doe impute the choice thereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chance, and wee must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to beleeue him: In short, As
<hi>Plainenesse</hi> did Charactarize the <hi>Tuscan,</hi>
so must <hi>Delicacie</hi> and <hi>Varietie</hi> the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi>
Pillar, besides the height of
his Ranke.</p>
            <p>The last is the <hi>Compounded Order:</hi>
His <hi>name</hi> being a briefe of his <hi>Nature.</hi>
For this Pillar is nothing in effect, but
a <hi>Medlie,</hi> or an <hi>Amasse</hi> of all the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Ornaments,</hi> making a new kinde,
by stealth, and though the most rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tricked, yet the poorest in this, that
he is a borrower of all his Beautie. His
length, (that he may haue somewhat
of his owne) shalbe of ten <hi>Diameters.</hi>
His degree should, no doubt, bee the
highest by reasons before yeelded.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21018:25"/>
But few <hi>Palaces</hi> Auncient or Moderne
exceede the third of the Ciuill <hi>Orders.</hi>
The <hi>Intercolumniation,</hi> but a <hi>Diameter</hi>
and an halfe, or alwayes somewhat
lesse then two. The <hi>Contraction</hi> of this
Pillar must be one eight Part lesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
then belowe. To know him
will be easie by the verie mixture of his
<hi>Ornaments,</hi> and <hi>Cloathing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so much touching the fiue <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
of <hi>Columnes,</hi> which I will conclude
with two or three, not impertinent
<hi>Cautions:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, that where more of these <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
then one, shalbe set in seuerall
<hi>Stories</hi> or <hi>Contignations,</hi> there must bee
an exquisite care, to place the <hi>Columnes</hi>
precisely, one ouer another, that so,
the <hi>solid</hi> may answere to the <hi>solid,</hi> and
the <hi>vacuities</hi> to the <hi>vacuities,</hi> as well
for <hi>Beautie,</hi> as strength of the <hi>Fabrique:</hi>
And by this Caution the Consequence
is plaine, that when wee speake of the
<hi>Intercolumniation</hi> or <hi>distance,</hi> which is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21018:26"/>
due to each <hi>Order,</hi> we meane in a <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,
Ionicall, Corinthian Porch,</hi> or <hi>Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
or the like of one <hi>Contignation,</hi> and
not in Storied buildings.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let the <hi>Columnes</hi> aboue
be a forth part lesse then those below,
saith <hi>Vitruuius, lib. 5. cap. 1.</hi> A strange
Precept, in my opinion, and so strange,
that peraduenture it were more su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
euen to his owne Principles, to
make them rather a fourth Part grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
For <hi>lib. 3. cap. 2.</hi> where our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
handleth the <hi>Contractions</hi> of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
wee haue an <hi>Optique</hi> Rule, that the
higher they are, the lesse should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
their diminution aloft, because
the <hi>Eye</hi> it selfe, doth naturally contract
all <hi>Obiects</hi> more or lesse, according to
the <hi>Distance;</hi> which consideration,
may, at first sight, seeme to haue beene
forgotten in the Caution wee haue
now giuen; but <hi>Vitruuius</hi> (the best In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of himselfe) hath in the same
place of his fift Booke, well acquitted
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21018:26"/>
his memorie by these words: <hi>Columnae
superiores quarta parte minores, quàm infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riores,
sunt constituendae; proptereà quòd,
operi ferendo quaesunt inferiora, firmiora
esse debent;</hi> preferring like a wise Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick,
the <hi>naturall</hi> Reason, before
the <hi>Mathematicall,</hi> and sensible conceits
before abstracted. And yet <hi>lib. 4. cap. 4.</hi>
he seemeth againe, to affect <hi>Subtiltie,</hi>
allowing pillars the more they are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neled,
to bee the more slender; because
while our <hi>Eye</hi> (saith hee) doth as it
were distinctly measure, the eminent
and the hollowed Parts, the Totall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
appeareth the bigger, and so as
much as those excauations, doe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
is supplied by a <hi>Fallacie</hi> of the
<hi>Sight:</hi> But here mee thinks, our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
should likewise haue rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
the naturall Inconuenience;
for though Pillars by chaneling, bee
seemingly ingrossed to our Sight, yet
they are truely weakened in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues;
and therefore ought perchance
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21018:27"/>
in sound reason not to bee the more
slender, but the more Corpulent, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
apparances preponder truths, but
<hi>Contra Magistrum, non est disputandum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third Caution shalbe that all the
<hi>proiected</hi> or <hi>Iutting</hi> Parts (as they are
tearmed) be very moderate, especially,
the <hi>Cornices</hi> of the lower <hi>Orders,</hi> for
whilest some thinke to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iue them, a
beautifull and royall Aspect, by their
largenesse, they sometimes hinder both
the Light within, (whereof I shall
speake more in due place) and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
detract much from the viewe of
the <hi>Front</hi> without, as well appeareth in
one of the principall Fabriques at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
namely the Palace, of the Duke
<hi>Grimani</hi> on the <hi>Canal Grande,</hi> which by
this magnificent errour, is somewhat
disgraced: I neede now say no more
concerning <hi>Columnes</hi> &amp; their <hi>Adiuncts,</hi>
about which Architects make such a
noyse in their Bookes, as if the very
tearmes of <hi>Architraues,</hi> and <hi>Frizes,</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:21018:27"/>
and <hi>Cornices,</hi> and the like, were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to graduate a Master of this
<hi>Art;</hi> yet let me before I passe to other
matter, preuent a familiar Obiection;
It will perchance bee said, that all this
Doctrine touching the fiue <hi>Orders,</hi>
were fitter for the <hi>Quarries</hi> of <hi>Asia</hi>
which yeelded 127 <hi>Columnes</hi> of 60 <hi>Foote</hi>
high, to the <hi>Ephesian Temple,</hi> or for
<hi>Numidia</hi> where <hi>Marbles</hi> abound; then
for the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who must be
contented with more ignoble <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials:</hi>
To which I answere, that this
neede not discourage vs: For I haue
often at <hi>Venice</hi> viewed with much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
an <hi>Atrium Graecum</hi> (we may trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
it an <hi>Anti porch,</hi> after the Greeke
manner) raised by <hi>Andrea Palladio,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
eight <hi>Columnes</hi> of the <hi>Compounded
Order;</hi> The <hi>Bases</hi> of Stone, without
<hi>Pedistals,</hi> The <hi>shafts</hi> or Bodies, of
meere Brick; three foote and an halfe
thicke in the <hi>Diameter</hi> below, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
thirty fiue foote high, as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21018:28"/>
himselfe hath described them in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Booke; Then which, mine Eye,
hath neuer yet beheld any <hi>Columnes,</hi>
more stately of Stone or Marble; For
the Bricks, hauing first beene formed
in a <hi>Circular Mould,</hi> and then cut before
their burning into foure quarters or
more, the sides afterwards ioyne so
closely, and the points concenter so
exactly, that the <hi>Pillars</hi> appeare one
<hi>entire Peece;</hi> which short description, I
could not omit, that thereby may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
how in truth wee want rather
<hi>Art</hi> then stuffe, to satisfie our greatest
<hi>Fancies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Pillars,</hi> the next in my distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
are <hi>Pylasters,</hi> mentioned by
<hi>Vitruuius, lib. 5. cap. 1.</hi> and scant any
where else vnder the name of <hi>Parasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
as <hi>Philander</hi> conceiueth, which
<hi>Grammaticall</hi> point (though perchance
not very cleere) I am contented to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
no farther. Alwayes, what we
meane by the thing it selfe, is plaine
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21018:28"/>
enough in our owne vulgar; Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which, I will briefly collect the
most considerable notes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pylasters,</hi> must not bee too tall and
slender, least they resemble <hi>Pillars,</hi> nor
too <hi>Dwarfish</hi> and grosse, least they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate
the <hi>Piles</hi> or <hi>Peeres</hi> of Bridges:
Smoothnesse doth not so naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them, as a Rusticke <hi>Superficies,</hi>
for they ayme more at <hi>State</hi> &amp; <hi>Srength,</hi>
then <hi>Elegancie.</hi> In priuate Buildings
they ought not to be narrower, then
one Third, nor broader then two
parts of the whole Vacuity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>Pylaster</hi> and <hi>Pylaster;</hi> but to
those that stand at the <hi>Corners,</hi> may be
allowed a little more Latitude by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
for strength of the <hi>Angles:</hi> In
<hi>Theaters</hi> and <hi>Amphi-theaters,</hi> and such
weighty Workes, <hi>Palladio</hi> obserueth
them, to haue beene as broad as the
halfe, and now and then as the whole
<hi>Vacuitie:</hi> Hee noteth likewise (and
others consent with him) that their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:21018:29"/>
true <hi>Proportion,</hi> should bee an <hi>exact
Square;</hi> But for lessening of expence,
and inlarging of roome, they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
narrower in <hi>Flanke,</hi> then in
<hi>Front:</hi> Their principall <hi>Grace</hi> doth
consist in halfe or whole <hi>Pillars,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
vnto them; in which case it is
well noted by Authors, that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes</hi>
may bee allowed somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
their ordinary length, because
they leane vnto so good <hi>Supporters.</hi>
And thus much shall sufice touching
<hi>Pilasters,</hi> which is a cheape, &amp; a strong,
and a noble kinde of <hi>Structure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now because they are oftner, both
for Beauty and Maiesty, found <hi>Arched,</hi>
then otherwise; I am heere orderly
led to speake of <hi>Arches,</hi> and vnder the
same head of <hi>Vaults:</hi> for an <hi>Arch</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
indeed but a contracted <hi>Vault,</hi>
and a <hi>Vault</hi> is but a dilated <hi>Arch:</hi>
Therefore to handle this Piece both
compendiously, and fundamentally, I
will resolue the whole businesse into a
few <hi>Theoremes.</hi>

               <p>All solid <hi>Materials</hi> free from impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment,
doe descend <hi>perpendicularly</hi>

any Supporters sustayning the

will necessarily sinke, euen by their
owne naturall <hi>Grauity,</hi> and much more
if they suffer any depression by other

                  </hi> they haue roome
to descend <hi>perpendicularly,</hi> without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
according to the former
<hi>Theoreme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Therefore to make them

pieces betweene can sinke till the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters</hi>
giue way, because they want
roome in that <hi>Figuration,</hi> to descend
<hi>perpendicularly.</hi> But this is yet a weake

               <p>First, That they bee as few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

are <hi>Weaknings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That they doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
too neere the <hi>Angles</hi> of the
Wals; for it were indeed a most essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
<hi>Solecisme</hi> to weaken that part,
which must strengthen all the rest: A

Which speculation though it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
vnto vulgar <hi>Artizans,</hi> perhaps too

remember, that <hi>Vitruuius</hi> himself doth
determine many things in his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
by <hi>Musicall</hi> grounds, and much
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21018:33"/>
commendeth in an <hi>Architect,</hi> a <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi>

<hi>Causes,</hi> and into the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
Of the <hi>Ornaments,</hi> belonging both
to <hi>Doores</hi> and <hi>Windowes,</hi> I shall speake
in other place; But let mee heere adde
one obseruation; That our <hi>Master</hi> (as
appeareth by diuers passages, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

beene an extreame Louer of <hi>Luminous
Roomes;</hi> And indeede I must confesse
that a Franke Light, can misbecome
noe A <hi>Edifice</hi> whatsoeuer, <hi>Temples</hi> onely
excepted; which were anciently darke,
as they are likewise at this day in some
Proportion. <hi>Deuotion more requiring

is no part of <hi>Structure</hi> either more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencefull,
then <hi>Windowes;</hi> or more
ruinous; not onely for that vulgar
reason, as being exposed to all violence
of weather; but because consisting of
so different and vnsociable pieces, as
<hi>Wood, Iron, Leade,</hi> and <hi>Glasse,</hi> and those
small and weake, they are easily shaken;
I must likewise remember one thing,
(though it be but a <hi>Grammatical</hi> note)
touching <hi>Doores.</hi> Some were <hi>Fores,</hi> &amp;
Some were <hi>Valuae.</hi> Those (as the very

a lesser <hi>Circuit</hi> in their <hi>vnfoulding;</hi>
And therefore much in vse among <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
at this day; But I must charge
them with an Imperfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for

how to raise faire <hi>Mantels</hi> within the

the shafts of <hi>Chimnies</hi> abroad (as

<hi>Philippe de l' Orme:</hi> In this part of his
<hi>Worke</hi> more diligent, then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or, to doe him right, then any
man else.</p>
               <p>First, hee obserueth very soberly,
that who in the disposition of any
Building will consider the nature of
the <hi>Region,</hi> and the <hi>Windes</hi> that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
blow, from this, or that <hi>Quarter;</hi>

most need fire; that hee should little
feare the incommodity of <hi>Smoake,</hi> and
therefore hee thinkes, that inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
for the most part to proceede
from some inconsiderate beginning.
Or if the error lay not in the <hi>Disposition</hi>
but in the <hi>Structure</hi> it selfe; then hee
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21018:36"/>
makes a <hi>Logicall</hi> enquiry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That either
the <hi>Winde</hi> is too much let in aboue, at
the mouth of the <hi>Shafte,</hi> or the <hi>Smoke</hi>
stifeled below; If none of these, Then
there is a repulsion of the <hi>Fume,</hi> by
some higher <hi>Hill</hi> or <hi>Fabrique,</hi> that shall
ouertoppe the <hi>Chimney</hi> and worke the
former effect: If likewise not this,
Then he concludes, that the Roome
which is infested, must bee necessarily
both little and close, so as the smoke
cannot issue by a naturall <hi>Principle,</hi>
wanting a succession and supply of
new <hi>Ayre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, In these cases he suggesteth

place with the hole vpwards, vpon
an yron Wire, that shall trauerse the

the ordinary height of the sharpest
heate or flames, whereof the water
within being rarified, and by rarifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
resolued into <hi>Winde,</hi> will breake out,
and so force vp the smoke, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
might linger in the <hi>Tunnell,</hi> by
the way, and oftentimes reuert; With
the other, (saith he) wee may supply
the place of the former, when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted,

(which how base soeuer in vse, yet for

like a <hi>Tunnell</hi> to the wilde Aire aloft:
which all Italian Artizans commend

               <p>Thus hauing considered the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

               <p>First therefore, Let no man that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth

the <hi>Schiographia</hi> or <hi>Ground lines;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               </p>
               <p>Next that the said Modell bee as

which aduise omited by the <hi>Italian

                     </gap>ion</hi> it selfe;

of the whole <hi>Ground-plot</hi> both
for roomes of <hi>Office,</hi> and of <hi>Reception</hi>
or <hi>Entertainement,</hi> as farre as the <hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi>
thereof, and the nature of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi>
will comport. Which circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the present <hi>Subiect,</hi> are all of
maine consideration, and might yeeld
more discourse then an <hi>Elementall Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sodie</hi>
will permit. Therefore (to ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomize
briefly this Definition) the
<hi>Gracefulnesse</hi> (whereof wee speake)
will consist in double <hi>Analogie,</hi> or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencie.
First, between the <hi>Parts</hi>
and the <hi>Whole,</hi> whereby a <hi>great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brique</hi>
should haue <hi>great Partitions, great
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21018:39"/>
Lights, great Entrances, great Pillars</hi> or
<hi>Pylasters;</hi> In summe, all the <hi>Members
great.</hi> The next betweene the <hi>Parts</hi>
themselues, not only, considering their
<hi>Breadths,</hi> and <hi>Lengths,</hi> as before, when
wee spake of <hi>Doores</hi> and <hi>Windowes;</hi> but
here likewise enters a third respect of
<hi>Height,</hi> a point (I must confesse) hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reduceable to any generall precept.</p>
               <p>True it is, that the <hi>Ancients</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the <hi>Longitude</hi> of all <hi>Roomes,</hi>
which were longer then broade, by
the double of their <hi>Latitude, Vitruuius
lib. 6. cap. 5.</hi> And the <hi>Heighth</hi> by the halfe
of the breadth and length summed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
But when the Roome was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
square, they made the <hi>Height</hi> half
as much more as the <hi>Latitude;</hi> which
Dimensions the moderne <hi>Architects</hi>
haue taken leaue to varie vpon discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Sometimes squaring the <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
and then making the <hi>Diagoniall</hi> or
ouerthwart Line, from <hi>Angle</hi> to <hi>Angle,</hi>
of the said <hi>Square,</hi> the measure of the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21018:40"/>
                  <hi>Heighth</hi> sometimes more, but seldome
lower then the full breadth it selfe;
which boldnesse of quitting the old
<hi>Proportions,</hi> some attribute first to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
Angelo da Buonaroti,</hi> perchance
vpon the credite he had before gotten,
in two other <hi>Arts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second point is <hi>Vsefulnesse,</hi>
which will consist in a sufficient <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
of Roomes, of all sorts, and in their
apt <hi>Coherence,</hi> without <hi>distraction,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>confusion;</hi> so as the beholder may
not onely call it, <hi>Vna Fabrica ben raccol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:</hi>
as <hi>Italians</hi> vse to speake of well vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Workes, but likewise that it may
appeare <hi>airie</hi> and <hi>spiritous,</hi> and fit for
the welcome of cheerefull Guests; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which the principall difficultie
will bee in contriuing the <hi>Lightes,</hi> and
<hi>Staire-cases,</hi> whereof I will touch a
note or two: For the first, I obserue
that the ancient <hi>Archietects</hi> were at
much ease. For both the <hi>Greekes</hi> and
<hi>Romanes</hi> (of whose priuate dwellings
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21018:40"/>
                  <hi>Vitruuius</hi> hath left vs some description)
had commonly two <hi>Cloystered</hi> open
<hi>Courts,</hi> one seruing for the <hi>Womens</hi>
side, and the other for the <hi>Men:</hi> who
yet perchance now adayes would take
so much seperation vnkindly. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
by this meanes, the reception of
<hi>light,</hi> into the Bodie of the building,
was very prompt, both from without
and from within: which we must now
supplie either by some open <hi>Forme</hi> of
the <hi>Fabrique,</hi> or among gracefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges,
by <hi>Tarrasing</hi> any <hi>Storie,</hi> which is
in danger of darkenesse; or lastly, by
<hi>perpendicular lights,</hi> from the <hi>Roofe:</hi> of
all other the most naturall, as shalbe
shewed anon. For the second di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie:
which is casting of the <hi>Stayre-cases;</hi>
That being in it selfe no hard
point, but onely as they are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
of roome for other vse: (which
lights were not) I am therefore aptly
moued heere to speake of them. And
first of Offices.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:21018:41"/>
I haue marked a willingnesse, in the

and euen the <hi>Buttrie</hi> likewise, vnder

<hi>Ascent</hi> into the house <hi>Fifteene Foote</hi> or
more for that Ende, which besides
the benefit of remouing such <hi>Annoyes</hi>
out of sight, and the gayning of so
much more roome aboue, doth also
by eleuation of the <hi>Front,</hi> adde <hi>Maiestie</hi>
to the whole <hi>Aspect.</hi> And with such a
disposition of the principall <hi>Stayre-case,</hi>

But the <hi>Definition</hi> (aboue determined)
doth call vs to some consideration of
our owne Countrie, where though all
the other pettie <hi>Offices</hi> (before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed)
may well enough bee so remote,
yet by the naturall <hi>Hospitalitie</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the <hi>Buttrie</hi> must be more visible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and wee neede perchance for our
<hi>Raunges,</hi> a more spacious and lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
<hi>Kitchin,</hi> then the foresaid <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partition</hi>
will beare; with a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
neerenesse likewise to the <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Roome</hi> Or else besides other Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences,
perhapes some of the Dishes
may straggle by the way; Heere let me
note a common defect, that wee haue
of a very vsefull <hi>Roome,</hi> called by the
<hi>Italians Il Tinello;</hi> and familliar, nay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
essentiall, in all their great <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles.</hi>
It is a Place properly appointed,
to conserue the meate that is taken
from the Table, till the <hi>Waiters</hi> eate,
which with vs by an olde fashion, is
more vnseemely set by, in the meane
while.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:21018:42"/>Now touching the distribution of
<hi>Lodging</hi> chambers; I must here take
leaue to reprooue a fashion, which I
know not how hath preuailed
through <hi>Italie,</hi> though without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
examples, as farre as I can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
by <hi>Vitruuius.</hi> The thing I meane,
is, that they so cast their <hi>partitions</hi> as
when all <hi>Doors</hi> are open, a man may see
through the whole <hi>House;</hi> which doth
necessariely put an intollerable serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
vpon all the <hi>Chambers</hi> saue the
<hi>Inmost,</hi> where none can arriue, but
through the rest; or else the <hi>Walles</hi> must
be extreame thicke for secret passages
And yet this also will not serue the
turne, without at least <hi>Three</hi> doores
to euery <hi>Roome:</hi> A thing most insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable,
in cold &amp; windie Regions, and
euery where noe small weakening to
the whole <hi>Worke;</hi> Therefore with vs
that want no cooling, I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the direct opposition of such
<hi>Ouertures,</hi> being indeede meerely
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21018:42"/>
grounded vpon the fond ambition
of displaying to a <hi>Stranger</hi> all our <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture</hi>
at one <hi>Sight,</hi> which therefore is
most maintained by them that meane
to harbour but a few; whereby they
make onely aduantage of the <hi>vanitie,</hi>
and seldome proue the <hi>Inconuenience.</hi>
There is likewise another def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

will necessarily follow, vpon such a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
disposing of inward Chambers.
That they must bee forced to make as
many common great <hi>Roomes,</hi> as there
shalbe seuerall <hi>Stories;</hi> which (besides
that they are vsually darke, a point
hardly auoided, running as they
doe, through the middle of the whole
<hi>House</hi>) doe likewise deuoure so much
Place, that thereby they want other
<hi>Galleries,</hi> and Roomes of <hi>Retreate,</hi>
which I haue often considered among
them (I must confesse) with no small
wonder; for I obserue no <hi>Nation</hi>
in the World, by Nature more <hi>priuate</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:21018:43"/>
and <hi>reserued,</hi> then the <hi>Italian,</hi> and on

<hi>priuacie;</hi> so as there is a kinde of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
betweene their <hi>Dwelling,</hi> and their
<hi>Being:</hi> It might heere perchance bee
expected, that I should at least describe
(which others haue done in <hi>draughts</hi>
and <hi>designes</hi>) diuers <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi>
and <hi>Partitions,</hi> and varieties of <hi>Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
But speculatiue <hi>Writers</hi> (as I am)
are not bound, to comprise all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Cases, within the Latitude of the
<hi>Subiect,</hi> which they handle; Generall
Lights, and <hi>Directions,</hi> and pointings
at some faults, is sufficient. The rest
must be committed to the sagacitie of
the <hi>Architect,</hi> who will bee often put to
diuers ingenious shifts, when hee is to
wrestle with scarsitie of <hi>Ground.</hi> As
sometimes *<note place="margin">The <hi>Italians</hi> call it <hi>vna stanza dannata,</hi> as when a Buttrie is cast vnder a a stayre-Case, or the like.</note> to damme one Roome
(though of speciall vse) for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and beautie of all the rest; Another
while, to make those fairest, which are
most in <hi>Sight,</hi> and to leaue the other
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21018:43"/>
(like a cunning Painter) in shadow,
<hi>cum multis alijs,</hi> which it were infinite
to pursue. I will therefore close this
Part touching <hi>Compartition,</hi> as cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
as I can with a short description
of a <hi>Feasting</hi> or <hi>entertayning Roome,</hi> after
the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> manner, who seeme (at
least till the time of <hi>Vitruuius</hi>) from the
auncient <hi>Hebrewes</hi> and <hi>Phenicians</hi>
(whence all knowledge did flow) to
haue retayned, with other <hi>Sciences,</hi> in a
high degree, also the <hi>Principles,</hi> and
<hi>practise</hi> of this magnificent <hi>Art.</hi> For
as farre as I may coniecture by our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Text, <hi>lib. 6. cap. 5.</hi> (where as in many
other Places he hath tortured his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters</hi>)
there could no <hi>Forme,</hi> for
such a Royall vse, bee comparably
imagined, like that of the foresaide <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which I shall aduenture to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine.</p>
               <p>Let vs conceiue a <hi>Floore</hi> or <hi>Area</hi> of
goodly length, (For example, at least
of 120 foote) with the <hi>breadth</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21018:44"/>
more then the halfe of the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude,</hi>
whereof the reason shalbe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
rendred. About the two longest
<hi>sides,</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the said <hi>Roome,</hi> shall
runne an Order of <hi>Pillars,</hi> which <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio</hi>
doth suppose <hi>Corinthian</hi> (as I see by
his designe) supplying that point out
of <hi>Greece,</hi> because we know no <hi>Order,</hi>
proper to <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The fourth <hi>side</hi> I wil
leaue free for the <hi>Entrance:</hi> On the
foresaid <hi>Pillars</hi> was laid an <hi>Architraue,</hi>
which <hi>Vitruuius</hi> mentioneth alone:
<hi>Palladio</hi> addes thereunto (and with
reason) both <hi>Freeze</hi> and <hi>Cornice,</hi> ouer
which went vp a continued <hi>Wall,</hi> and
therein, halfe or three quarter <hi>Pillars,</hi>
answering directly, to the Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
but a fourth Part lesse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
these halfe <hi>Columnes</hi> aboue, the
whole Roome was windowed round
about.</p>
               <p>Now, from the lowest <hi>Pillars</hi> there
was layd ouer a <hi>Contignation</hi> or Floore,
borne vpon the outward <hi>Wall,</hi> and the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:21018:44"/>
                  <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Columnes</hi> with <hi>Tarrace</hi> and
<hi>Pauement, Sub dio</hi> (saith our Master)
and so indeed hee might safely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the matter in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they
feare no <hi>Clowds:</hi> Therefore <hi>Palladio</hi>
(wo leaueth this <hi>Tarrace</hi> vncouered in
the middle, and <hi>ballised</hi> about) did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
construe him rightly, though
therein discording from others: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
we must vnderstand a sufficient
breadth of <hi>Pauement,</hi> left between the
open part and the <hi>Windowes,</hi> for some
delight of <hi>Spectators,</hi> that might looke
downe into the <hi>Roome:</hi> The <hi>Latitude</hi>
I haue supposed contrary to some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Positions, a little more then the
halfe of the length; because the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
standing at a competent distance
from the outmost <hi>Wall,</hi> will by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the <hi>Sight,</hi> somewhat in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
diminish the breadth; In
which cases, (as I haue touched once
or twice before) <hi>Discretion</hi> may bee
more licentious then <hi>Art.</hi> This is the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21018:45"/>
description of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> roome, for
<hi>Feastes</hi> and other <hi>Iollities.</hi> About the
<hi>Walles</hi> whereof wee must imagine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<hi>Satues,</hi> placed below, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by the descending Light, from
the <hi>Tarrace,</hi> as likewise from the <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes</hi>
betweene the halfe <hi>Pillars</hi> aboue:
So as this <hi>Roome</hi> had abundant and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantageous
<hi>Light;</hi> and besides other
garnishing, must needes receiue much
<hi>State</hi> by the very heighth of the <hi>Roofe,</hi>
that lay ouer two orders of <hi>Columnes:</hi>
And so hauing runne through the
foure parts of my first generall <hi>Diuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
namely, <hi>Foundation, Walles, Apperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and <hi>Compartition;</hi> the <hi>House</hi> may
now haue leaue to put on his <hi>Hatte:</hi>
hauing hitherto beene vncouered it
selfe, and consequently vnfit to couer
others. Which point though it be the
last of this <hi>Art</hi> in execution, yet it is
alwayes in <hi>Intention</hi> the first, For who
would build but for <hi>Shelter?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obtayning both the <hi>Place,</hi> and the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21018:45"/>
dignity of a <hi>Finall cause,</hi> it hath beene
diligently handled by diuerse, but by
none more learnedly then <hi>Bernardino
Baldi</hi> Abbot of <hi>Guastalla</hi> (before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon other occasion) who doth
fundamentally, and <hi>Mathematically</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the firmest <hi>Knittings</hi> of the
vpper <hi>Timbers,</hi> which make the <hi>Roofe.</hi>
But it hath beene rather my <hi>Scope,</hi> in
these <hi>Elements</hi> to fetch the ground of
all, from <hi>Nature</hi> her selfe, which indeed
is the simplest mother of <hi>Art.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will now onely deliuer a few of
the properest, and (as I may say) of the
naturalest considerations, that belong
to this remayning <hi>Piece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two extremities to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded
in the <hi>Couer,</hi> or <hi>Roofe:</hi> That
it be not too <hi>heauy,</hi> nor too <hi>light.</hi> The
first, will suffer a vulgar obiection of
pressing too much the vnder-worke.
The other, contayneth a more secret
inconuenience; for the <hi>Couer</hi> is not
onely a bare defence, but likewise a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21018:46"/>
kinde of <hi>Band</hi> or <hi>Ligature,</hi> to the whole
<hi>Fabrique,</hi> and therefore would require
some reasonable weight. But of the
two extreames, a House <hi>Top-heauie</hi>
is the worst. Next there must bee a
care of <hi>Equality,</hi> that the <hi>Edifice</hi> be not
pressed on the one side more then on
the other; and here <hi>Palladio</hi> doth
wisely (like a cautelous <hi>Artizan</hi>) that
the inward Walles might beare some
good share in the burthen, and the
outward be the lesse charged.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Italians</hi> are very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
in giuing the <hi>Couer</hi> a gracefull <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
or <hi>slopenesse,</hi> diuiding the whole
breadth into <hi>Nine</hi> parts; whereof two
shal serue for the eleuation of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>Toppe</hi> or <hi>Ridge,</hi> from the lowest.
But in this point the quality of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
is considerable: For (as our <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truuius</hi>
insinuateth) those <hi>Climes</hi> that
feare the falling and lying of much
<hi>Snow,</hi> ought to prouide more inclining
<hi>Pentices:</hi> and <hi>Comelinesse</hi> must yeeld to
<hi>Necessity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:21018:46"/>
These are the vsefullest Cautions
which I finde in <hi>Authors,</hi> touching the
last <hi>Head</hi> of our Diuision, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I will conclude the first <hi>Part</hi> of
my present <hi>Trauaile.</hi> The second re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth,
concerning <hi>Ornaments</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
or without the <hi>Fabrique:</hi> A Piece
not so dry as the meere Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of proportions. And therefore I
hope therein, somewhat to refresh
both the <hi>Reader,</hi> and my selfe.</p>

For which ende, there are
two <hi>Arts</hi> attending on <hi>Architecture,</hi> like
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21018:47"/>
two of her principall <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> to
<hi>dresse</hi> and <hi>trimme</hi> their <hi>Mistresse;</hi> PIC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVRE
&amp; SCVLPTVRE: Between whom,
before I proceed any further, I wil ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to determine an ancient quarrell
about their <hi>Precedency,</hi> with this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction;</hi>
that in the garnishing of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briques,
Sculpture</hi> no doubt must haue
the <hi>preheminence,</hi> as being indeede of
neerer affinity to <hi>Architecture</hi> it selfe,
and consequently the more naturall,
and more sutable <hi>Ornament.</hi> But on the
other side, (to consider these two <hi>Arts</hi>
as I shall doe <hi>Philosophically,</hi> and not
<hi>Mechanichally</hi>) An excellent Piece of
<hi>Painting,</hi> is to my iudgement the more
admirable <hi>Obiect,</hi> because it comes
neere an <hi>Artificiall Miracle;</hi> to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
distinct <hi>Eminences</hi> appeare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a <hi>Flat,</hi> by force of <hi>Shadowes,</hi> and
yet the <hi>Shadowes</hi> themselues not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare:
which I conceiue to be the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost
value and vertue of a <hi>Painter,</hi>
and to which very few haue arriued in
all <hi>Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:21018:48"/>
In these two <hi>Arts</hi> (as they are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the <hi>Subiect</hi> which I handle) it
shall bee fit first to consider how to
<hi>choose</hi> them; and next, how to <hi>dispose</hi>
them. To guide vs in the <hi>choyce,</hi> wee
haue a <hi>Rule</hi> somewhere (I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member)
in <hi>Pliny,</hi> and it is a prettie
obseruation: That they doe mutually
helpe to censure one another. For
<hi>Picture</hi> is best when it standeth off, as
if it were carued; and <hi>Sculpture</hi> is best
when it appeareth so <hi>tender,</hi> as if it
were <hi>painted,</hi> I meane, when there is
such a seeming softnesse in the <hi>Limbes,</hi>
as if not a <hi>Chissell</hi> had hewed them out
of <hi>Stone,</hi> or other <hi>Materiall,</hi> but a <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sill</hi>
had drawne and stroaked them in
<hi>Oyle,</hi> which the iudicious <hi>Poet</hi> tooke
well to his Fancy.</p>
            <q>Excudent alij spirantia mollius aera.</q>
            <p>But this generalitie, is not sufficient
to make a good <hi>chooser,</hi> without a more
particular contraction of his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Therefore when a Piece of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21018:48"/>
               <hi>Art,</hi> is set before vs, let the first Caution
be, not to aske who made it, least the
<hi>Fame</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> doe Captiuate the
<hi>Fancie</hi> of the <hi>Buyer.</hi> For, that excellent
<hi>Men</hi> doe alwaies <hi>excellently,</hi> is a false
Conclusion; whereupon I obserue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>Italian</hi> Artizans three notable
<hi>Phrases,</hi> which well decipher the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of their Workes.</p>
            <p>They will tell you, that a thing was
done <hi>Con diligenza, Constudio,</hi> and <hi>Con
Amore;</hi> The first, is but a bare and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
diligence,</hi> The second, is a <hi>learned
diligence;</hi> The third, is much more, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a <hi>louing diligence;</hi> They meane not
with loue to the <hi>Bespeaker</hi> of the
<hi>Worke,</hi> but with a loue and delight in
the <hi>Worke</hi> it selfe, vpon some speciall
<hi>Fancie</hi> to this, or that <hi>Storie;</hi> And
when all these concurre (perticularly
the last) in an eminent <hi>Author,</hi> Then
perchance <hi>Titianus Fecit,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
will serue the <hi>Turne,</hi> without farther <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition;</hi>
Otherwise Artizans haue not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21018:49"/>
onely their <hi>growthes</hi> and <hi>Perfections,</hi>
but likewise their <hi>Vaines</hi> and <hi>Tymes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Caution must be (to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
<hi>Logically</hi>) that in Iudging of the
<hi>Worke</hi> it selfe, wee bee not distracted
with too many things at once; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
first (to beginne with <hi>Picture</hi>)
we are to obserue whether it bee well
<hi>drawne,</hi> (or as more elegant <hi>Artizans</hi>
tearme it) well <hi>Design'd;</hi> Then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be well <hi>Coloured,</hi> which bee the
two generall <hi>Heads;</hi> And each of them
hath two principall <hi>Requisites;</hi> For in
well <hi>Designing,</hi> there must bee <hi>Truth</hi>
and <hi>Grace,</hi> In well <hi>Colouring, Force,</hi> and
<hi>Affection;</hi> All other <hi>Praises,</hi> are but
Consequences of these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truth</hi> (as we Metaphorically take
it in this <hi>Art</hi>) is a <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Naturall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi>
in euery Part of the determined
<hi>Figure. Grace</hi> is a certaine <hi>free dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi>
in the whole <hi>Draught,</hi> answerable
to that vnaffected franknes of <hi>Fashion,</hi>
in a liuing <hi>Bodie,</hi> Man or Woman,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21018:49"/>
which doth <hi>animate Beautie</hi> where it is,
and <hi>supplie</hi> it, where it is not,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Force</hi> consisteth, in the <hi>Roundings</hi> &amp;
<hi>Raisings</hi> of the <hi>Worke,</hi> according as the
<hi>Limbes</hi> doe more or lesse require it; So
as the <hi>Beholder,</hi> shall spie no <hi>sharpenesse</hi>
in the bordering <hi>Lines;</hi> As when Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors

<hi>Contorni taglienti;</hi> Nor any <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>

<hi>Darknesse,</hi> there is a kinde of <hi>Deepenesse,</hi>
But as in the <hi>Arte</hi> of <hi>perswasion,</hi> one of

to <hi>dimmer,</hi> which <hi>Italian Artizans</hi>
calle the <hi>middle Tinctures;</hi> That is, Not
as the <hi>whites,</hi> and <hi>yolkes</hi> of <hi>Egges</hi> lie in
the <hi>Shell,</hi> with visible distinction; But
as when they are <hi>beaten,</hi> and <hi>blended,</hi> in
a <hi>Dish:</hi> which is the neerest compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that I can suddenly conceiue.</p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>Affection</hi> is the <hi>Liuely Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment,</hi>
of any <hi>passion</hi> whatsoeuer, as if
the <hi>Figures</hi> stood not vpon a <hi>Cloth</hi> or
<hi>Boorde,</hi> but as if they were <hi>acting</hi> vpon a
<hi>Stage;</hi> And heere, I must remember,
in truth with much marueile, a note,
which I haue receiued, from excellent
<hi>Artizans,</hi> that though <hi>Gladnesse,</hi> and
<hi>Griefe,</hi> be opposites in <hi>Nature;</hi> yet they
are such <hi>Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Confiners</hi> in
<hi>Arte,</hi> that the least touch of a <hi>Pensill,</hi>
will translate a <hi>Crying,</hi> into a <hi>Laughing</hi>
Face; which <hi>Instance,</hi> besides diuers
other, doth often reduce vnto my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
that Ingenious <hi>Speculation,</hi> of
the <hi>Cardinall Cusanus</hi> extant in his

And thus much of the foure
<hi>Requisites,</hi> and <hi>Perfections</hi> in <hi>Picture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Sculpture</hi> likewise, the <hi>Two</hi> first are
absolutely necessarie; The <hi>third</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent;
For <hi>Solide</hi> Figures neede no

Therefore in the Roome of this,
wee may put (as hath beene before
touched) a kinde of <hi>Tendernesse,</hi> by the

the <hi>Chissell,</hi> I must confesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath more
glory then the <hi>Pensill;</hi> that being so
hard an <hi>Instrument,</hi> and working vpon
so vnpliant stuffe, can yet leaue <hi>Strokes</hi>
of so gentle <hi>appearance.</hi>
            </p>

of <hi>Affection</hi> (as farre as it doth depend
vpon the <hi>Actiuity,</hi> and <hi>Gesture</hi> of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>)
is as proper to the <hi>Caruer,</hi> as to

            <p>This is that witty Censure of the
ancient Artizans, which <hi>Quintilian</hi>
hath left vs, where the last <hi>Charactar</hi>
of <hi>Demetrius</hi> doth require a little <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall</hi>
examination; How an <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,</hi>
whose end is the <hi>imitation</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
can bee too <hi>naturall;</hi> which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21018:53"/>
in our dayes was either the fault,
or (to speake more gently) the too
much perfection of <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> and
perhaps also of <hi>Michael Angelo da Buo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naroti,</hi>
betweene whom I haue heard
noted by an ingenious <hi>Artizan,</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
nice difference, that the <hi>German</hi> did
too much expresse <hi>that which was;</hi> and
the <hi>Italian, that which should be:</hi> Which
seuere obseruation of <hi>Nature,</hi> by the
one in her <hi>commonest,</hi> and by the other
in her <hi>absolutest</hi> Formes, must needs
produce in both a kinde of <hi>Rigidity,</hi>
and consequently more <hi>naturalnesse</hi>
then <hi>gracefulnesse:</hi> This is the clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
reason, why some exact <hi>Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trists</hi>
haue been blamed, for being too
true, as neere as I can deliuer my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.
And so much touching the
choyce of <hi>Picture</hi> and <hi>Sculpture:</hi> The
next is, the <hi>application</hi> of both, to the
<hi>beautifying</hi> of <hi>Fabriques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First therefore touching <hi>Picture,</hi>
there doth occurre a very pertinent
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21018:54"/>
doubt, which hath beene passed ouer
too slightly, not onely by some <hi>Men,</hi>
but by some <hi>Nations;</hi> namely, whether
this <hi>Ornament</hi> can wel become the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi>
of <hi>houses,</hi> wherin the <hi>Germanes</hi> haue
made so little scruple, that their best
<hi>Townes</hi> are the most painted, as <hi>Augusta</hi>
and <hi>Norembergh.</hi> To determine this
question in a word: It is true, that a
<hi>Story</hi> well set out with a good <hi>Hand,</hi>
will euery where take a <hi>Iudicious</hi> eye:
But yet withal it is as true, that various
colours on the <hi>Out-walles</hi> of <hi>Buildings,</hi>
haue alwayes in them more <hi>Delight</hi>
then <hi>Dignity:</hi> Therfore I would there
admit no <hi>Paintings</hi> but in <hi>Blacke</hi> and
<hi>White,</hi> nor euen in that kinde any <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>
(if the roome be capable) vnder
<hi>Nine</hi> or <hi>Ten</hi> foot high, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no ordinary <hi>Artizan;</hi> because the
faults are more <hi>visible</hi> then in small
<hi>Designes.</hi> In vnfigured <hi>paintings</hi> the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
is, the imitation of <hi>Marbles,</hi> &amp; of
<hi>Architecture</hi> it selfe, as <hi>Arches, Treezes,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21018:54"/>
Columnes,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Inside,</hi> heere growes
another doubt, whether <hi>Grotesca</hi> (as
the <hi>Italians</hi>) or <hi>Antique</hi> worke (as wee
call it) should be receiued, against the
expresse authoritie of <hi>Vitruuius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<hi>lib. 7. cap. 5.</hi> where <hi>Pictura</hi> (saith
hee) <hi>Fit eius, quod est, seu potest esse,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
by this seuere definition, all
<hi>Figures</hi> composed of different <hi>Natures</hi>
or <hi>Sexes;</hi> so as a <hi>Syrene</hi> or a <hi>Centaure</hi>
had beene intolerable in his eye: But
in this wee must take leaue to depart
from our <hi>Master,</hi> &amp; the rather because
he spake out of his owne <hi>profession,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Painters</hi> (who haue euer bin as
little limited as <hi>Poets</hi>) a lesse scope in
their imaginations, euen then the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> who sometimes doe
serue themselues of <hi>Instances,</hi> that haue
no <hi>Existence</hi> in <hi>Nature;</hi> as wee see in
<hi>Platoes Amphisboena,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aristotles Hirco-Ceruus.</hi>
And (to settle this point) what
was indeede more common and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21018:55"/>
among the <hi>Romanes</hi> themselues,
then the <hi>Picture</hi> and <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Terminus,</hi>
euen one of their <hi>Deities?</hi> which yet if
we well consider, is but a piece of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesca;</hi>
I am for these reasons vnwilling
to impouerish that <hi>Art,</hi> though I could
wish such <hi>medlie</hi> and <hi>motlie</hi> Designes,
confined onely to the <hi>Ornament</hi> of
<hi>Freezes,</hi> and Borders, their properest
place. As for other <hi>Storied</hi> Workes
vpon <hi>Walles,</hi> I doubt our <hi>Clime</hi> bee
too <hi>yeelding</hi> and <hi>moist,</hi> for such <hi>Garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
therefore leauing it to the <hi>Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
discretion, according to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his <hi>Seat;</hi> I will onely adde a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or two, about the disposing of
<hi>Pictures</hi> within.</p>
            <p>First, that no <hi>Roome</hi> bee furnished
with too many, which in truth were
a <hi>Surfet</hi> of <hi>Ornament,</hi> vnlesse they bee
<hi>Galleries,</hi> or some peculiar <hi>Repository</hi>
for <hi>Rarities</hi> of <hi>Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, that the best <hi>Pieces</hi> be placed
not where there is the <hi>least,</hi> but where
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21018:55"/>
there are the <hi>fewest lights;</hi> therefore
not onely <hi>Roomes</hi> windowed on both
ends, which we call through-lighted;
but with two or moe <hi>Windowes</hi> on the
same side, are enemies to this <hi>Art;</hi> and
sure it is, that no <hi>Painting</hi> can be seene
in full <hi>Perfection</hi> but (as all <hi>Nature</hi> is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated)
by a <hi>single</hi> Light.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that in the <hi>placing</hi> there be
some care also taken, how the <hi>Painter</hi>
did stand in the <hi>Working,</hi> which an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
<hi>Eye,</hi> will easily discouer, and
that <hi>Posture</hi> is the most naturall; so as
<hi>Italian</hi> pieces will appeare best in a
<hi>Roome</hi> where the <hi>Windowes</hi> are high;
because they are commonly made to
a descending <hi>Light,</hi> which of all other
doth set off mens <hi>Faces</hi> in their truest
Spirit.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that they bee as <hi>properly</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
for their <hi>quality,</hi> as <hi>fitly</hi> for their
<hi>grace:</hi> that is, <hi>chearefull</hi> Paintings in
<hi>Feasting</hi> and <hi>Banquetting</hi> Roomes; <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Stories</hi> in <hi>Galleries, Land-schips,</hi> and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21018:56"/>
               <hi>Boscage,</hi> and such <hi>wilde</hi> workes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<hi>Tarraces,</hi> or in <hi>Summer houses</hi> (as
we call them) and the like.</p>
            <p>And thus much of <hi>Picture,</hi> which
let mee close with this Note; that
though my former Discourse may
serue perchance for some reasonable
<hi>leading</hi> in the choyce of such delights;
yet let no man hope by such a <hi>specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi>
erudition, to discerne the <hi>Masterly</hi>
and <hi>Mysterious</hi> touches of <hi>Art,</hi> but an
Artizan himselfe; to whom therefore
we must leaue the <hi>prerogatiue,</hi> to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the manner and handling, as hee
himselfe must likewise leaue some
points, perchance of no lesse value to
others; as for example, whether the
<hi>Story</hi> be rightly <hi>represented,</hi> the <hi>Figures</hi>
in true <hi>action,</hi> the <hi>Persons suted</hi> to their
suerall qualities, the <hi>affections proper</hi>
and <hi>strong,</hi> and such like obseruations.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Sculpture,</hi> I must likewise
begin with a <hi>Controuersie,</hi> as before
(falling into this Place) or let mee ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21018:56"/>
call it a very meere <hi>Fancie,</hi> strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken by <hi>Palladio,</hi> who hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in an old <hi>Arch</hi> or two at <hi>Verona,</hi>
some part of the <hi>Materials</hi> already cut
in fine <hi>Formes,</hi> and some <hi>vnpolished,</hi>
doth conclude (according to his
<hi>Logicke</hi>) vpon this particular, that the
<hi>Auncients</hi> did leaue the outward <hi>Face,</hi>
of their <hi>Marbles</hi> or <hi>Free-stone,</hi> without
any <hi>Sculpture,</hi> till they were laid, and
<hi>Cimented,</hi> in the bodie of the <hi>Building;</hi>
For which likewise hee findeth a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(as many doe now and then very
wittily, euen before the thing it selfe be
true) that the Materialls being left
<hi>rough</hi> were more managable in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
hand, then if they had beene <hi>smooth;</hi>
And that so the <hi>sides</hi> might bee laide
together the more exactly; Which
Conceit, once taken hee seemes to
haue farther imprinted, by marking
in certaine Storied <hi>Sculptures,</hi> of oulde
time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how precisely the parts and <hi>Lines</hi>
of the <hi>Figures</hi> that passe from one Stone
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21018:57"/>
to another, doe meete; which hee
thinkes could hardly fall out so right,
(forgetting while he speakes of <hi>ancient</hi>
things, the auncient <hi>Diligence</hi>) vnlesse
they had beene cut, after the ioyning
of the <hi>Materials,</hi> But all these <hi>Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
cannot counteruaile the sole <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience</hi>
of <hi>shaking,</hi> and <hi>Disioynting</hi>
the <hi>Commissures</hi> with so many Strokes

Working on <hi>Scaffolds;</hi> especially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no testimonie, to confirme it, that
I haue yet seene among the records of
<hi>Art;</hi> Nay, it is indeede rather true, that
they did <hi>square,</hi> and <hi>Carue,</hi> and <hi>Polish,</hi>
their <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Marble</hi> Workes, euen in

was hardened by open Aire; But (to
leaue disputation) I will set downe a
few <hi>Positiue</hi> notes, for the placing of
<hi>Sculpture;</hi> because the chusing hath
beene handled before.</p>
            <p>That first of all, it bee not too <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That especially, There bee a due

two <hi>Incumbent</hi> Figures gracefully lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

if they meant to conferre; I should
thinke this a sufficient entertainement,
for the first <hi>Reception,</hi> of any <hi>Iudicious</hi>
Sight, which I could wish seconded,
with two great standing <hi>Statues</hi> on
each side of a paued way that shall
leade vp into the <hi>Fabrique,</hi> So as the
<hi>Beholder</hi> at the first entrance, may
passe his <hi>Eye</hi> betweene them.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Nices,</hi> if they containe <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>

For though <hi>Contraria iuxta se posita

it hath beene subtilly, and indeede true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            </p>
            <p>That <hi>fine</hi> and delicate <hi>Sculptures,</hi> be
helped with <hi>Neerenes,</hi> and <hi>Grosse</hi>

A famous emulation of two principall

(saith our Master, <hi>lib. 3. cap. 3.</hi> out
of a better <hi>Art</hi> then his owne) the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
beame</hi> of our eye, extended to the
<hi>Head</hi> of the said <hi>Figures,</hi> being longer
then to the <hi>Foote,</hi> must necessarily
make that <hi>part</hi> appeare <hi>farther;</hi> so as
to reduce it to an erect or vpright <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi>
there must be allowed a due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of <hi>stooping</hi> towards vs; which
<hi>Albert Durer</hi> hath exactly taught, in
his fore mentioned <hi>Geometry.</hi> Our
<hi>Vitruuius</hi> calleth this affection in the

which word (being in truth his owne,
for ought I know) wee are almost as
much beholding to him, as for the
obseruation it selfe: And let thus
much summarily suffice, touching the
choice and vse of these adorning <hi>Arts.</hi>
For to speake of garnishing the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brique</hi>
with a <hi>Row</hi> of erected <hi>Statues,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Cornice</hi> of euery <hi>Contignation</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:21018:59"/>
or Story, were discourse more proper
for <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of their
true greatnesse, when (as <hi>Plinie</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
of his own <hi>Age</hi>) there were neere
as many carued <hi>Images,</hi> as liuing <hi>Men;</hi>
like a noble contention, euen in point
of <hi>Fertility,</hi> betweene <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi>
which passage doth not onely argue
an infinite abundance, both of <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans</hi>
and <hi>Materials;</hi> but likewise of
<hi>Magnificent</hi> and <hi>Majesticall</hi> desires, in
euery common person of those times;
more or lesse according to their <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi>
And true it is indeed that the
Marble <hi>Monuments</hi> &amp; <hi>Memories</hi> of well
deseruing Men, wherewith the very
high wayes were <hi>strewed</hi> on each side
was not a bare and transitory enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement
of the <hi>Eye,</hi> or onely a gentle
deception of <hi>Time,</hi> to the <hi>Trauailer:</hi>
But had also a secret and strong <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
euen into the aduancement of the
<hi>Monarchie,</hi> by continuall representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of vertuous examples; so as in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21018:59"/>
that point <hi>ART</hi> became a piece of
<hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as I haue before subordinated
<hi>Picture,</hi> and <hi>Sculpture</hi> to <hi>Architecture,</hi> as
their Mistresse; so there are certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
ARTS likewise subordinate to
them: As vnder Picture, <hi>Mosaique;</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Sculpture, <hi>Plastique;</hi> which two, I
onely nominate, as the fittest to gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<hi>Fabriques.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mosaique</hi> is a kinde of Painting in
small <hi>Pebbles, Cockles</hi> and <hi>Shells</hi> of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
colours; and of late dayes likewise
with pieces of <hi>Glasse,</hi> figured at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
an <hi>Ornament</hi> in trueth, of much
beauty, and long life, but of most vse
in <hi>pauements</hi> and <hi>Floorings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plastique</hi> is not onely vnder <hi>Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
but in deed very <hi>Sculpture</hi> it selfe:
but with this difference; that the
<hi>Plasterer</hi> doth make his Figures by <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
and the <hi>Caruer</hi> by <hi>Substraction,</hi>
whereupon <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> was wont to
say somewhat pleasantly: That <hi>Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:21018:60"/>
was nothing but <hi>A purgation of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities.</hi>
For take away from a piece
of wood, or stone, all that is <hi>superfluous,</hi>
and the remainder is the intended <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</hi>
Of this <hi>Plastique Art,</hi> the chiefe
vse with vs is in the gracefull <hi>fretting</hi>
of roofes: but the <hi>Italians</hi> applie it,
to the <hi>manteling</hi> of <hi>Chimneys,</hi> with great
Figures. A cheape piece of <hi>Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi>
and as durable almost within
doores, as harder <hi>Forms</hi> in the weather.
And here though it bee a little excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I cannot passe vnremembred a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gaine,
 their manner of disguising the
shaftes of <hi>Chimneys</hi> in various fashions,
whereof the noblest is the <hi>Pyramidall:</hi>
beeing in trueth a piece of polite and
ciuill discretion, to conuert euen the
<hi>conduits</hi> of soote and smoake, into <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments;</hi>
whereof I haue hitherto spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as farre as may concerne the Bodie
of the Building.</p>
            <p>Now there are <hi>Ornaments</hi> also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
as <hi>Gardens, Fountaines, Groues, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatories</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:21018:60"/>
of rare <hi>Beasts, Birds,</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes.</hi>
Of which ignobler kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>Wee ought not</hi> (saith our greatest
<note n="*" place="margin">Arist. lib. 1 cap. 5. de part. Anim. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> Master among the sonnes of Nature)
<hi>childishly to despise the Contemplation; for
in all things that are naturall, there is euer
something, that is admirable.</hi> Of these
externall delights, a word or two.</p>
            <p>First, I must note a certaine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie
betweene <hi>building</hi> and <hi>gardening:</hi>
For as Fabriques should bee <hi>regular,</hi> so
Gardens should bee <hi>irregular,</hi> or at least
cast into a very wilde <hi>Regularitie.</hi> To
exemplifie my conceit; I haue seene
a <hi>Garden</hi> (for the maner perchance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable)
into which the first Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
was a high walke like a <hi>Tarrace,</hi>
from whence might bee taken a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
view of the whole <hi>Plott</hi> below; but
rather in a delightfull confusion, then
with any plaine distinction of the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
From this the <hi>Beholder</hi> descending
many steps, was afterwards conueyed
againe, by seuerall <hi>mountings</hi> and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:21018:61"/>
to various entertainements of his
<hi>sent,</hi> and <hi>sight:</hi> which I shall not neede
to describe (for that were poeticall)
let me onely note this, that euery one
of these diuersities, was as if hee had
beene <hi>Magically</hi> transported into a new
Garden.</p>
            <p>But though other <hi>Countreys</hi> haue
more benefite of Sunne then wee, and
thereby more properly tyed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
this delight; yet haue I seene
in our <hi>owne,</hi> a delicate and diligent <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riositie,</hi>
surely without <hi>parallel</hi> among
foreigne <hi>Nations:</hi> Namely, in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of Sir <hi>Henry Fanshaw,</hi> at his seat
in <hi>Ware-Parke,</hi> where I wel remember,
hee did so precisely examine the <hi>tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,</hi>
and <hi>seasons</hi> of his <hi>flowres,</hi> that in
their <hi>setting,</hi> the <hi>inwardest</hi> of those
which were to come vp at the same
time, should be alwayes a little <hi>darker</hi>
then the <hi>outmost,</hi> and so serue them for
a kinde of gentle <hi>shadow,</hi> like a piece
not of <hi>Nature,</hi> but of <hi>Arte:</hi> which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21018:61"/>
(incident to this place) I haue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
made of his <hi>Name,</hi> for the deare
<hi>friendship</hi> that was long betweene vs:
though I must confesse, with much
wrong to his other <hi>vertues;</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
a more solide <hi>memoriall,</hi> then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
these vacant obseruations. So
much of <hi>Gardens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fountaines</hi> are <hi>figured,</hi> or only plaine
<hi>Water'd-workes:</hi> Of either of which, I
will describe a matchlesse patterne.</p>
            <p>The first, done by the famous hand
of <hi>Michael Angelo da Buonaroti,</hi> in the
figure of a sturdie <hi>woman, washing</hi> and
<hi>winding</hi> of linnen clothes; in which
Acte, shee <hi>wrings</hi> out the water that
made the <hi>Fountaine;</hi> which was a
gracefull and naturall conceit in the
Artificer, implying this rule; That all
<hi>designes</hi> of this kind, should be <hi>proper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other doth merite some larger
expressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; There went a long, straight,
mossie walke of competent breadth,
greene, and soft vnder foot, listed on
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21018:62"/>
both sides with an <hi>Aquaeduct</hi> of white
stone, breast-high, which had a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>channell</hi> on the top, where ranne a
prety trickling streame; on the <hi>edge</hi>
whereof, were couched very thicke all
along, certaine small <hi>pipes</hi> of lead, in
little holes; so neatly, that they could
not be well perceiued, till by the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a cocke, they did sprout ouer
interchangeably from side to side, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
mans height, in forme of <hi>Arches,</hi>
without any intersection or meeting
aloft, because the pipes were not exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposite, so as the <hi>Beholder,</hi> besides
that, which was fluent in the <hi>Aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts</hi>
on both hands in his view, did
walke as it were, vnder a continuall
<hi>bowre</hi> or <hi>Hemisphere</hi> of water, without
any drop falling on him. An <hi>inuention</hi>
for refreshment, surely farre excelling
all the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> delicacies, and <hi>Pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques</hi>
of <hi>Hero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Groues,</hi> and artificiall deuices vnder
ground, are of great expence, and little
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21018:62"/>
dignitie; which for my part I could
wish conuerted here into those <hi>Crypte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
whereof mention is made among
the curious prouisions of <hi>Ticho Braghe</hi>
the <hi>Danish Ptolemie,</hi> as I may well call
him: which were deepe <hi>concaues</hi> in
gardens, where the <hi>starres</hi> might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
euen at <hi>noone.</hi> For (by the way)
to thinke that the brightnesse of the
Sunnes body aboue, doth drowne our
discerning of the lesser lights, is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
errour; the sole impediment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that lustre, which by <hi>reflection,</hi> doth
spread about vs, from the face of the
Earth; so as the <hi>caues</hi> before touched,
may well conduce, not to a delicious,
but to a learned pleasure.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Auiaries</hi> of wire, to keepe Birdes
of all sorts, the <hi>Italians</hi> (though no
wastfull Nation) doe in some places
bestow vast expence; including great
scope of <hi>ground,</hi> varietie of <hi>bushes, trees</hi>
of good height, running <hi>waters,</hi> and
sometimes a <hi>Stoue</hi> annexed, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21018:63"/>
the <hi>Aire</hi> in Winter. So as those
<hi>Chanteresses,</hi> vnlesse they be such as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
delight as much in their wing, as
in their voice, may liue long, among so
good prouisions and roome, before
they know that they are <hi>prisoners;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
often to my memory, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the <hi>Romane Stoicke,</hi> who in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of his owne free <hi>contemplations,</hi>
did thinke diuers great and splendent
fortunes of his time, little more then
<hi>commodious captiuities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>Ponds</hi> of pleasure neere
the habitation, I will referre my selfe
to a graue <hi>Author</hi> of our owne (though
more illustrious by his other<note n="*" place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

namely <hi>Sarisburiensis de Pis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I will end the second part
touching <hi>Ornaments,</hi> both <hi>within,</hi> and
<hi>without</hi> the <hi>Fabrique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as almost all those, which haue
deliuered the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Logicke,</hi> doe
vsually conclude, with a Chapter tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<hi>Methode;</hi> so I am heere seized
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21018:63"/>
with a kind of critical spirit, &amp; desirous
to shut vp these building <hi>Elements,</hi> with
some <hi>Methodical</hi> directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how to <hi>censure</hi>
Fabriques alreadie raised: for indeed
without some way to contract our
<hi>Iudgement,</hi> which among so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
would bee lost by diffusion; I
should thinke it almost harder to be a
good <hi>Censurer,</hi> then a good <hi>Architect:</hi>
Because the <hi>working</hi> part may be helped
with <hi>Deliberation,</hi> but the <hi>Iudging</hi> must
flow from an <hi>extemporall habite.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
(not to leaue this last <hi>Piece</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some <hi>Light</hi>) I could wish him that
commeth to examine any noble <hi>Work,</hi>
first of all to examine himselfe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perchance the <hi>sight</hi> of many braue
things before (which remaine like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
formes) haue not made him
apt to thinke nothing <hi>good,</hi> but that
which is the <hi>best;</hi> for this <hi>humour</hi> were
too sowre. Next, before hee come to
settle any imaginable opinion, let him
by all meanes seeke to informe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21018:64"/>
precisely, of the <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Worke</hi>
vpon which hee must passe his <hi>Doome.</hi>
And if hee shall finde the apparent <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes</hi>
to exceed the proportion of <hi>Time;</hi>
then let him conclude without farther
inquisition, as an absolute Decree,
that either the <hi>Materials</hi> were too <hi>slight,</hi>
or the <hi>Seate</hi> is nought. Now, after
these premisses, if the <hi>House</hi> be found
to beare his <hi>yeares</hi> well, (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
a token of sound <hi>constitution</hi>)
Then let him suddenly runne backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
(for the <hi>Methode</hi> of <hi>censuring</hi> is
contrary to the <hi>Methode</hi> of <hi>composing</hi>)
from the <hi>Ornaments</hi> (which first allure
the <hi>Eye</hi>) to the more essentiall <hi>Members,</hi>
till at last hee be able to forme this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi>
that the <hi>Worke</hi> is <hi>Commodious,
Firme,</hi> and <hi>Delightfull;</hi> which (as I said
in the beginning) are the three capitall
<hi>Conditions</hi> required in good <hi>Buildings,</hi>
by all <hi>Authors</hi> both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne.
And this is, as I may tearme it
the most <hi>Scientificall</hi> way of <hi>Censuring.</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:21018:64"/>
There are two other which I must not
forget. The first in <hi>Georgio Vassari,</hi>
before his laborious <hi>Worke</hi> of the liues
of <hi>Architects,</hi> which is to passe a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
examination ouer the whole <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difice,</hi>
according to the properties of a
<hi>well shapen Man.</hi> As whether the <hi>Wals</hi>
stand vpright vpon cleane footing and
<hi>Foundation;</hi> whether the <hi>Fabrique</hi> bee
of a beautifull <hi>Stature,</hi> whether for the
<hi>breadth</hi> it appeare well <hi>burnished,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the principall <hi>Entrance</hi> be on the
middle Line of the <hi>Front</hi> or Face, like
our <hi>Mouthes,</hi> whether the <hi>Windowes,</hi> as
our <hi>Eyes,</hi> be set in equall number and
distance on both sides, whether the
<hi>Offices</hi> like the <hi>Veines</hi> in our Bodies, be
vsefully distributed, and so forth. For
this <hi>Allegoricall</hi> review may be driuen as
farre as any <hi>Wit</hi> will, that is at leasure.</p>
            <p>The second way, is in <hi>Vitruuius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<hi>lib. 1. cap 2.</hi> where hee summarily
determineth six <hi>Considerations,</hi> which
accomplish this whole <hi>Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:21018:65"/>

            </list>
            <p>Whereof (in my conceit) wee may
spare him the first two; for as farre as
I can perceiue, either by his <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
or by his own <hi>Text</hi> (which in that
very place, where perchance he should
be <hi>clearest,</hi> is of all other the <hi>Clowdiest</hi>)
hee meaneth nothing by <hi>Ordination,</hi>
but a well setling of the <hi>Modell</hi> or <hi>Scale</hi>
of the whole <hi>Worke.</hi> Nor by <hi>Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
more then a neate and full expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

whatsoeuer. Whereof <hi>Eurythmia</hi> is

Roomes of the <hi>Fabrique,</hi> which sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
where it is taketh euery <hi>Behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
by the secret power of <hi>Proportion:</hi>
wherein let mee onely note this, That
though the least error or offence that
can be committed against <hi>sight,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of height; yet that fault is no
where of small importance, because it
is the greatest offence against the

that the principall <hi>Entrance</hi> was
neuer to be regulated by any certaine
<hi>Dimensions;</hi> but by the dignity of the

with some noble Embleme, or <hi>Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:21018:66"/>

            <q>Patet Ianua: Cor magis.</q>
            <p>And heere likewise I must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
our euer memorable Sir <hi>Philip Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
(whose <hi>VVit</hi> was in truth the very
rule of <hi>Congruity</hi>) who well knowing
that <hi>Basilius</hi> (as hee had painted the
<hi>State</hi> of his <hi>Minde</hi>) did rather want
some extraordinary <hi>Formes</hi> to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his <hi>Fancie,</hi> then <hi>roome</hi> for <hi>Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi>
was contented to place him in a
<hi>Star-like Lodge;</hi> which otherwise in
seuere <hi>Iudgement</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> had beene an
incommodious <hi>Figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Distributio</hi> is that vsefull <hi>Casting</hi> of
all Roomes for <hi>Office, Entertainement,</hi>
or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> which I haue handled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at more length, then any other
Piece.</p>
            <p>These are the Foure <hi>Heads</hi> which
euery man should runne ouer, before
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21018:66"/>
hee passe any determinate <hi>Censure,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Works that he shal view, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I will close this last part, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Ornaments.</hi> Against which (mee
thinkes) I heare an <hi>Obiection,</hi> euen from
some well-meaning man; That these
delightfull <hi>Craftes,</hi> may be diuers wayes
ill applied in a <hi>Land.</hi> I must confesse
indeede, there may bee a <hi>Lasciuious,</hi>
and there may be likewise a <hi>superstitious</hi>
vse, both of <hi>Picture</hi> and of <hi>Sculpture:</hi>
To which possibility of misapplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not onely these <hi>Semi-liberall Arts</hi>
are subiect; but euen the highest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and <hi>endowments</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> As
<hi>Beautie</hi> in a light woman, <hi>Eloquence</hi>
in a mutinous Man, <hi>Resolution</hi> in an
Assasinate, Prudent <hi>obseruation</hi> of
houres &amp; humours, in a corrupt Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
<hi>Sharpenesse</hi> of wit and argument
in a seducing Scholler; and the like.
Nay, finally let mee aske, what ART
can be more pernicious, then euen
RELIGION it selfe, if it selfe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21018:67"/>
into an Instrument of ART:
Therefore, <hi>Ab abuti ad non vti, negatur
consequentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus hauing stitched in some sort
together, these <hi>Animaduersions,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<hi>Architecture,</hi> and the <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
thereof; I now feele that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue</hi>
spirits are as restlesse as <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue;</hi>
for doubting with my selfe, (as
all weakenesse is iealous) that I may be
thought to haue spent my poore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation
abroad, about nothing but
Stone and Timber, and such Rubbage;
I am thereby led into an immodestie
of proclaiming another Worke, which
I haue long deuoted to the seruice of
my <hi>Countrey:</hi> Namely, <hi>A Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Suruey of Education,</hi> which is indeed,
a second <hi>Building,</hi> or repairing of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and, as I may tearme it, a kinde of
<hi>Morall Architecture;</hi> whereof such
Notes as I haue taken in my foreigne
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21018:67"/>
transcursions or abodes, I hope to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without publike offence, though
still with the freedome of a plaine <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi>
man. In the meane while I haue
let these other <hi>Gleanings</hi> flie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
like the Bird out of the

may bee, for that
