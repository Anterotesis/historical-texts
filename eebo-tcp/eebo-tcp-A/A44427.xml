            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, ought in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to be Yours, since, not only the best part of them were made at Your House, but they were made designedly for
<pb facs="tcp:49730:4"/>
You, so that this is not a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication writ to a Book, but a Book writ to a Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which, however, is the nicest part a Writer has to manage; for the most deserving Men, are the most averse to be told so, and what would please all their Friends and Acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, wou'd displease them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; which makes the Poet at a loss, whether to dissatisfie one, or many; his Readers, or his Patron.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49730:4"/>But since I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy found it easier to You, to oblige, than to receive thanks for an Obligation, to do no violence to Your Modesty, I must do one to my own Justice, and desist from a Theme, which I could so willingly inlarge upon, but You so unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly read.</p>
            <p>I shall say little of the following Essays, either of the Originals I Translated
<pb facs="tcp:49730:5"/>
them from, or the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations: One thing, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I find from my own Experience; That where there is most Life, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the Author, the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator is carried on, with the greater vigour and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity; as a Man swims faster in a Stream, than a standing Water; but where the Original is flat, and low, the Translator must be at the pains to raise him; so that the best things,
<pb facs="tcp:49730:5"/>
are the easiest to be done; and the dullest, the most difficult.</p>
            <p>It were presumption in one of my Years, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give an account of the Authors whom I have chosen, or their Works; to commend their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or condemn their Faults; and of the two, I dare venture to say the least of <hi>Ovid</hi>; when he himself, and all that he has writ,
<pb facs="tcp:49730:6"/>
have been already so well, and so fully treated of, in Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s Preface before his <hi>Epistles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I cannot choose but wonder, That a Book so extreamly delightful, so sort, and sweet, as <hi>Tibullus,</hi> has lain so long unattempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but there is a Friend of ours, whom, I hope, he has been all along re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for, and then, he will be in the best hands
<pb facs="tcp:49730:6"/>
he could have fall'n in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</p>
            <p>Of the three <hi>Elegies</hi> that I have ventured on; the first, from toward the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to the end, and the whole third, pleas'd me infinitely; the second I did meerly for the sake of the last Ten, or Twelve Lines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tibullus</hi> must, certainly, have felt all he Writ, for
<pb facs="tcp:49730:7"/>
He could never have feign'd so much Passion so well; and I am apt to believe, it was not his Poetry, made him so fond, and tender a Lover<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but rather his Love, that made him so sweet, and excellent a Poet; were it not that I should take him out of better hands, I would have attempted to have Englished him all, for I flatter my self with a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that, in some things, I am somewhat of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb facs="tcp:49730:7"/>
and, how far short so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I come of him in his Poetry, I resemble him, but too nearly, in some other Circumstances.</p>
            <p>I was almost running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Complaint, that would have been both unjust, and ingrateful; for since I knew You, all occasion of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint has been taken from me. Your Acquaintance, would have been of it self sufficient, to endear You
<pb facs="tcp:49730:8"/>
to any Man; but Your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to me, began with, and even out-ran Your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: I dare not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, tho' on a Subject which I am very loth to leave; permit me to add only this, that since most who ever writ, have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times stood in need of Favours from other Men, and since the same Fortune has attended me, I am glad however, that it threw me on You to receive them,
<pb facs="tcp:49730:8"/>
than whom, I know none I could have been more willingly obliged to, for them.</p>

            <l>And by whose aid, they have their wants supply'd.</l>
            <l>You are, my Lord, the Poets earliest Theme,</l>
            <l>And the first word he speaks, is <hi>Dorset</hi>'s Name.</l>
            <l>To You the Praise of every Muse is due,</l>
            <l>For every Muse is kept alive by You.</l>
            <l>Their boasted stream, from your rich Ocean pours,</l>
            <l>And all the Helicon they drink, is yours.</l>

            <l>They shall to future Ages make you known,</l>
            <l>Their Verse shall give you Fame; but more, your own.</l>
            <l>Immortal Wit shall its great Patron boast,</l>

            <l>AS when a Prophet feels the God retir'd,</l>
            <l>By whom he had a long time lain inspir'd,</l>
            <l>His Eyes no more with Sacred Fury roul,</l>
            <l>No more Divine Impulses move his Soul:</l>
            <l>The <hi>Fires</hi> that warm'd him, with the <hi>God</hi> are gone,</l>
            <l>The Deity with-drawn, the Charm is done.</l>
            <l>So now my Muse can no more Rapture boast,</l>
            <l>Since you went hence, her Inspiration's lost.</l>
            <l>Robb'd of her Flame, all languishing she lies,</l>
            <l>And, Swan-like, only sings before she dies.</l>
            <l>But you, my Friend, to different Fortune move,</l>
            <l>And crown your days with Wine, your nights with Love.</l>
            <l>In endless bliss, unbounded time you waste,</l>
            <l>Your ravishing Delights, for ever last.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:49730:14"/>Long, long e're this, you've often been possest,</l>
            <l>Of all your wish could frame to make you blest.</l>
            <l>When you, and <hi>Southern, Moyle,</hi> and <hi>Congreve</hi> meet,</l>
            <l>The best, good Men, with the best-natur'd Wit.</l>
            <l>Good Wine, good Company, the better Feast,</l>
            <l>And whene're <hi>Wicherly</hi> is present, best.</l>
            <l>Then, then your Joys are perfectly compleat,</l>
            <l>And Sacred Wit is at the Noblest height.</l>
            <l>Oh! how I long to be allow'd to share,</l>
            <l>And gain a Fame, by mingling with you there.</l>
            <l>The Country now can be no longer born,</l>
            <l>And since you first are gone, I must return;</l>
            <l>I come, I come, dear <hi>Hammond,</hi> to pursue</l>
            <l>Pleasures I cannot know, depriv'd of you.</l>
            <l>Restless, as Lovers, till we meet, I live,</l>
            <l>And envy this, because 'twill first arrive.</l>
            <l>With Joy I learnt, <hi>Dryden</hi> designs to crown,</l>
            <l>All the great things he has already done.</l>

            <l>Adieuâ€”</l>
            <l>And yet methinks, I owe too much to you,</l>
            <l>To part so Coldly with a bare Adieu.</l>
            <l>But what Requital can I make you more?</l>
            <l>You've put all Recompence beyond my Power.</l>
            <l>Fain wou'd my working <hi>Thoughts</hi> contrive a way,</l>
            <l>For every generous Man's in pain to pay.</l>
            <l>Tis not a suitable return I give,</l>
            <l>Yet what it is, my best-good Friend, receive;</l>
            <l>Take the best Wishes of a grateful Soul;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Congreve,</hi> and <hi>Moyle,</hi> and you, possess it whole.</l>
            <l>Take all the Thanks, a Country Muse can send,</l>
            <l>And in accepting this, oblige your Friend.</l>

            <l>The barbarous Foe, like an ingrateful Guest,</l>

            <l>But now the Traitor, has usurp'd it whole,</l>
            <l>I burn with Pains, too great to be endur'd,</l>
            <l>And yet I neither can, nor would be cur'd,</l>

            <l>If conquering Camps refus'd to give me ease,</l>

            <l>I mingle no Applauses with the Pit,</l>

            <l>I see the shining Beauties sit around,</l>

               </l>
               <l>A Virgin, sprung from <hi>Peneus</hi> Silver Stream,</l>
               <l>Fair as the Crystal Waters, whence she came.</l>
               <l>No blind Effects of Chance subdu'd the God,</l>

               <l>For <hi>Phoebus</hi> saw him as his Bow he drew,</l>
               <l>And Scoffing, cry'd, those are not Arms for you.</l>
               <l>To me your Quiver, and your Shafts resign,</l>
               <l>They load your Shoulders, but sit well on mine;</l>

               <l>Shedding his pois'nous Gore, o're all the Field.</l>
               <l>Be you content to kindle amorous Fires,</l>
               <l>Inspiring childish Loves, and soft Desires;</l>
               <l>Attempt not things beyond your feeble Powers,</l>

               <l>And, from them all, he made his choice of two.</l>
               <l>Differing the Passions, which their Points create,</l>
               <l>The one producing Love, the other Hate:</l>

               <l>High on the Mountain's utmost Cliff he stood,</l>

               <l>Her only joy, was ranging thro' the Grove,</l>
               <l>To shun her Lovers, and their tales of Love.</l>
               <l>There the wild Boars were wounded with her Spear:</l>
               <l>Her only passion was to conquer there.</l>

               <l>She fled from <hi>Hymen,</hi> and his hated Rites:</l>
               <l>Oft had her Father prompted her to wed;</l>
               <l>By fond desires of future Grandson led:</l>

               <l>The winds, that toss'd her flowing Robes abroad,</l>

               <l>Still the Fair Nymph grew lovelier as she fled,</l>
               <l>Loose in the Air, her Golden Locks were spread,</l>
               <l>And her Cheeks glow'd, with an unusual red.</l>
               <l>Th' impatient God admits no more delay,</l>
               <l>And throws no more unheeded words away:</l>
               <l>Stronger, his pliant Limbs he strives to move,</l>

               <l>The trembling Hare, runs on with dreadful doubt,</l>

               <l>He casts his Eagle off, and Royal Crown,</l>
               <l>And lets his Bolts fall to the Pavement, down.</l>
               <l>Divested thus, he quits the blest Abode,</l>

               <l>By something still distinguish'd from the rest.</l>
               <l>His whiteness did the new-fal'n Snow excel,</l>

               <l>When he, desirous to behold, at last,</l>
               <l>The soft kind Nymph whom he so oft embrac't.</l>
               <l>With a Torch, lighted at a fatal time,</l>
               <l>Discern'd at once his Daughter, and his Crime.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His rage, and grief, no room for words afford,</l>
               <l>But speechless at the sight, he snatch'd his Sword;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:49730:35"/>Frighted she flies, assisted by the Night,</l>
               <l>Whose darkness shelter'd, and secur'd her flight.</l>
               <l>Far from her Country, and those conscious Fields,</l>

               <l>Long she revolv'd on what she thought might move,</l>
               <l>And thus, at last, invokes the Powers above.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>On you, great Gods, in these Extreams I call,</l>

               <l>She feels her Legs, now cover'd with the ground,</l>

               <l>The spreading Root shoots downward from her Toes,</l>

               <l>To Pith her Marrow turns, her Bones to Wood,</l>
               <l>Fed by the Sap, which was of late the Blood.</l>
               <l>Her Arms great Boughs, her Fingers form the small,</l>
               <l>Her once soft Skin, now hard'ned, covers all.</l>
               <l>Now, her big Womb, the rising Bark supprest,</l>
               <l>Which now creeps higher o're her panting Breast.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49730:36"/>When she, impatient in her change to lose</l>
               <l>Her hated Being, and her cruel Woes;</l>
               <l>Sunk down within the Tree, whose closing top,</l>
               <l>For ever lock'd her charming Beauties up.</l>
               <l>Who, tho' she lost all other Sense with Life,</l>
               <l>She still retains that wretched one of Grief.</l>
               <l>Her lasting Sorrows in her Tears are shown,</l>
               <l>Which, from her Bark, course one another down.</l>
               <l>Those Tears are precious too, and keep the Name,</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ceyx,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and King of <hi>Trachis,</hi> a City in <hi>Thessaly,</hi> having been alarm'd by several Prodigies, prepares to go and consult <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Oracle at <hi>Claros,</hi> to learn the Will of Heav'n, and receive the Gods Instructions: His Voyage: The Description of a Storm and Shipwrack: The Description of the God of Sleep, and his Palace: The Lamentation of <hi>Halcyone,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Eolus,</hi> and Wife of <hi>Ceyx,</hi> for the loss of her Husband; with the change of both into Sea Fowls, call'd after her name, <hi>Halcyons</hi>; are the Subjects of the following Verses; beginning with her Speech to her Husband, to disswade him from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Voyage.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:49730:37"/>HOw are you chang'd of late, my Love, how grown</l>
            <l>So tir'd of me, so pressing to be gone?</l>
            <l>What have I done, to make my Lord remove</l>
            <l>So far from her, who once had all his Love?</l>
            <l>Is your <hi>Halcyone</hi> no longer dear?</l>
            <l>Or, to whatever place your course you steer,</l>
            <l>Can you enjoy your self, and she not there?</l>
            <l>Yet, if you went by Land, 'twere some relief,</l>
            <l>For all that would torment me then, were Grief.</l>
            <l>But now, at once, with Grief, and Fear, opprest,</l>
            <l>A thousand anxious thoughts destroy my rest,</l>
            <l>And not one dawn of Comfort chears my Breast.</l>
            <l>The faithless Seas are what, alas! I fear,</l>
            <l>I must not let my <hi>Ceyx</hi> venture there.</l>
            <l>Oft have I heard their troubled waters roar,</l>
            <l>And seen their foaming waves surmount the Shore.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49730:37"/>Oft seen the wreck come floating to the Coast,</l>
            <l>And vent'rous Wretches by their Folly lost.</l>
            <l>Nor have I seldom, sad Inscriptions read,</l>
            <l>On Marble Tombs, which yet inclos'd no Dead.</l>
            <l>Let me alone, my <hi>Ceyx,</hi> be believ'd,</l>
            <l>And be not by your flatt'ring hopes deceiv'd.</l>
            <l>Trust not the Seas, although my Father binds,</l>
            <l>Within his Rocky Caves, the struggling Winds.</l>
            <l>If once broke loose, nought can their Rage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain,</l>
            <l>They sweep o're all the earth, swell all the Main;</l>
            <l>Drive Clouds on Clouds, by an abortive Birth,</l>
            <l>From their dark Wombs, flashing the Thunder forth.</l>
            <l>More, more than what my feeble words express,</l>
            <l>Which only represent their fury less.</l>
            <l>Let me perswade, for I have seen them rage,</l>
            <l>Seen all the <hi>Wars,</hi> the fighting <hi>Winds</hi> cou'd wage.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49730:38"/>Did you, like me, their stern Encounters know,</l>
            <l>As daring as you are, you wou'd not go.</l>
            <l>If all this fail to move your stubborn mind,</l>
            <l>And you will go, oh! leave not me behind.</l>
            <l>Take me along, let me your Fortunes share,</l>
            <l>There's nought too hard for Love like mine to bear.</l>
            <l>In Storms, and Calms, together let us keep,</l>
            <l>Together brave the dangers of the Deep,</l>
            <l>The grant of this, my flattering Love assures,</l>
            <l>Which knows no Joys, and feels no Griefs but yours.</l>
            <l>Thus spoke the lovely Queen, all drown'd in Tears,</l>
            <l>Nor was her Husband's Passion less than hers.</l>
            <l>Yet wou'd he not his first Resolves recall,</l>
            <l>Nor, suff'ring her to venture, hazard all.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49730:38"/>He said, whate're he fancy'd might abate</l>
            <l>Her Griefs, although his own were full as great.</l>
            <l>Yet, all in vain, he labour'd to remove</l>
            <l>The tender fears of her Prophetick Love.</l>
            <l>Still the same Sighs from her heav'd Heart arise,</l>
            <l>And the same Streams still bubble at her Eyes.</l>
            <l>All this succeeding not, My Love, he cry'd,</l>
            <l>(The last best Speech, that cou'd be then apply'd.)</l>
            <l>To you shou'd <hi>Ceyx</hi> absence tedious seem,</l>
            <l>Believe that yours is not less so to him:</l>
            <l>For, by my Father's brightest Fires, I swear,</l>
            <l>By your dear self, believe my mournful Dear,</l>
            <l>E're twice the Moon renews her blunted Horns,</l>
            <l>If Destiny permits, your Love returns.</l>
            <l>This just suffic'd to ease her troubled Heart,</l>
            <l>And of her many Cares, dispel a part.</l>
            <l>And now he bids them Launch without delay,</l>
            <l>While she took truce with Grief, to Sail away.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:49730:39"/>That last Command awak'd her sleeping Fears,</l>
            <l>And she again seem'd all dissolv'd in Tears.</l>
            <l>Around his Neck, her circling Arms she threw,</l>
            <l>And, mix'd with Sighs, forc'd out a faint Adieu.</l>
            <l>Then, as he left her hold, too feeble grown,</l>
            <l>(Rob'd of her dear Support) to stand alone,</l>
            <l>The last sad pangs, at parting, sunk her down.</l>
            <l>Th' impatient Seamen call upon their Lord,</l>
            <l>And almost bear him thence by force, aboard.</l>
            <l>Then, having fix'd their Oars, begin to sweep,</l>
            <l>And cleave, with well-tim'd stroaks, the yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deep.</l>
            <l>Faintly, her op'ning Eyes the Ship survey,</l>
            <l>Which bears her Lord, and her last hopes away.</l>
            <l>In their own Tears, her trembling Eye-balls swim,</l>
            <l>Which hinder'd not, but she distinguish'd him:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:49730:39"/>Too distant now for words, aloft he stands,</l>
            <l>On the tall Deck, and she upon the Sands,</l>
            <l>Wafts her last Farewell, with her lifted hands.</l>
            <l>Then, as the Ship drove farther from the Coast,</l>
            <l>And that dear Object in the Crowd was lost;</l>
            <l>The flying Bark, her following Eyes pursue;</l>
            <l>That gone, the Sails employ'd her latest view.</l>
            <l>All out of sight, she seeks the widow'd Bed,</l>
            <l>Where <hi>Ceyx</hi> and her self so oft were laid.</l>
            <l>But now half fill'd, the sad remembrance mov'd,</l>
            <l>Of the dear Man, who made the whole belov'd.</l>
            <l>By this, the gathering Winds began to blow,</l>
            <l>Their useless Oars, the joyful Seamen stow.</l>
            <l>Then hoist their Yards, while loosen'd from the Masts,</l>
            <l>The wide-stretch'd Sails receive the coming Blasts.</l>

                  <l>NOw, far from either Shore, they plow'd their way,</l>
                  <l>And all behind them, and before, was Sea.</l>
                  <l>When, with the growing Night, the Winds rose high,</l>
                  <l>And swelling Seas, presag'd a Tempest nigh.</l>
                  <l>Aloud the Master cries, furl all the Sails,</l>

                  <l>But his Commands are born unheard away,</l>

               <l>And the fair Maid, whose Charms have won her Slave.</l>
               <l>No more my native freedom can I boast,</l>
               <l>But all my once lov'd Liberty is lost.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49730:61"/>Yet why such heavy Fetters must I wear?</l>
               <l>And why obey a Mistress, so severe?</l>
               <l>Why must I drag such a perplexing Chain?</l>
               <l>Which Tyrant Love will never loose again:</l>
               <l>Whether I merit her esteem, or scorn,</l>
               <l>Offending, or Deserving, still I burn.</l>
               <l>Ah! cruel Maid! these scorching Flames remove,</l>

               <l>Oh! rather than endure the pains I feel,</l>

               <l>To grow a senseless Stone, fix'd on a barren Hill:</l>
               <l>Or a bleak Rock, amidst the Seas be set,</l>

               <l>All that I wish the Charms of Verse may prove,</l>

               <l>Nor trust it to the lavish Tongue of Fame;</l>
               <l>But a safe silent Privacy esteem,</l>
               <l>Which gives him Joys, unknown to all, but him,</l>
               <l>To Woods, and Wilds, I cou'd with thee remove,</l>
               <l>Secure of Life, when once secure of Love.</l>
               <l>To wait on thee, cou'd Desart paths explore,</l>
               <l>Where never Human footstep trod before.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:49730:65"/>Peace of my Soul, and Charmer of my Cares,</l>
               <l>Thou Courage of my Heart, thou Conqu'rour of my Fears.</l>
               <l>Disposer of my Days, unerring Light,</l>
               <l>And safe Conductress in my darkest Night.</l>
               <l>Thou, who alone, art all I wish to see,</l>
               <l>Thou, who alone, art all the World to me.</l>
               <l>Shou'd the bright Dames of Heav'n, the Wives of Gods,</l>
               <l>To court my Bed, forsake their blest Abodes;</l>
               <l>With all their Charms endeav'ring to divert</l>
               <l>My fix'd Affections, and estrange my Heart;</l>
               <l>To thee, vain Rivals, all the Train shou'd prove,</l>
               <l>Vain Suit, the glorious Nymphs to me shou'd move,</l>
               <l>Who wou'd not change thee for the Queen of Love.</l>
               <l>All this I swear, By all the Powers Divine,</l>
               <l>But swear by <hi>Juno</hi> most, because she's thine.</l>
               <l>

               <l>On this Confession, you'll insult the more;</l>
               <l>In fiercer flames make your poor Vassal burn,</l>
               <l>And treat your suppliant Slave with greater scorn<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </l>

               </l>
               <l>To thee, my Fate entirely I resign,</l>

               <l>You know, my cruel Fair, you know my Pains,</l>
               <l>And pleas'd, and proud, you see me drag your Chains.</l>
               <l>But if to <hi>Venus</hi> I for succour flee,</l>
               <l>She'll end your Tyrant Reign, and rescue me.</l>

            <head>A Farewell TO POETRY.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>AS famish'd Men, whom pleasing Dreams delude,</l>
               <l>Seem to grow full with their imagin'd Food:</l>
               <l>Appease their Hunger, and indulge their Taste,</l>
               <l>With fancy'd Dainties, while their Visions last.</l>
               <l>Till some rude hand breaks up the flatt'ring Scene;</l>
               <l>Awaken'd, with regret, they starve again.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49730:68"/>So the false Muse prepares her vainer Feasts,</l>
               <l>And so she treats her disappointed Guests:</l>
               <l>She promises vast things, immortal Fame,</l>
               <l>Vast Honour, vast Applause, a deathless Name,</l>
               <l>But well awake, we find it all a Dream.</l>
               <l>She tells soft tales, with an inchanting Tongue,</l>
               <l>And lulls our Souls, with the bewitching Song:</l>
               <l>How she, alone, maltes Heroes truly great;</l>
               <l>How, dead long since, she keeps them living yet.</l>
               <l>Shews her <hi>Pernassus,</hi> like a flow'ry Grove,</l>
               <l>Fair, and delightful, as the Bowers above;</l>
               <l>The fittest place for Poetry, and Love.</l>
               <l>We hunt the Pleasures thro' the fairy Coast,</l>
               <l>Till in our fruitless search our selves are lost.</l>
               <l>So the great Artist drew the lively Scene,</l>
               <l>Where hungry Birds snatch'd at the Grapes in vain.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:49730:68"/>Tir'd with the Chase, I give the Phantom o're,</l>
               <l>And am resolv'd to be deceiv'd no more.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus the fond youth, who long, in vain, has strove,</l>
               <l>With the fierce pangs of unsuccessful Love;</l>
               <l>With joy, like mine, breaks the perplexing Chain,</l>
               <l>Freed, by some happy chance, from all his pain,</l>
               <l>With joy, like mine, he grows himself again.</l>
