            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT
VVORSHIPFVLL, SIR
EDWARD BARRET, Knight.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I haue often wished, that some oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie
might be offered vnto me, to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that louing and honorable respect
which I haue euer born vnto you. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other, I gladly embraced this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
occasion of publishing this Sermon, concerning Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination,
which I long since preached, and of late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiewed.
For seeing diuers conferences which I had at
your house, concerning this, and some other like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
first of all occasioned me to think of the reuiewing,
and then of publishing thereof: I was desirous to offer
the fruits of that labour, as a testimonie of my louing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
vnto you. And your vnfained loue to Gods
truth, and that religious affection, which from your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Progenitors, as an hereditarie blessing, is des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
vnto you, doe perswade, yea, euen assure me, that
<pb facs="tcp:9500:3"/>
you will accept this not so much as a pledge of mine, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the loue of God vnto you. For that right and interest
which your selfe, and euery one of Gods children haue in
Gods Election, makes delightfull, yea, sweetneth vnto
them; as euery doctrine of Gods Word, so this especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wherein is contained the chiefest treasures of their
spirituall comfort. In the handling whereof, I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured,
according to that measure of knowledge
which God hath vouchsafed vnto mee, to satisfie the
mindes of the godly, and cleerely remoue those principall
doubts, and cauils, which occasion some maliciously to
carpe; others, in the weakenesse of their vnderstanding,
to stumble and take offence at this holy doctrine. What I
haue performed in this so weighty and obscure an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I willingly submit to the iudgement of Gods
Church and children, not doubting but the same God,
who put these meditations into my heart, will accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the same with his owne blessing vnto the hearts of
many of his children, and seruants. In which confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
together with my hearty desire to God, that hee
will continue and multiply his blessings vpon you,
I remaine</p>

            <p>Againe, the Word of God, as it is most perfect and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
not wanting any one point at all, which is needfull for
our instruction, and knowledge; so may we not once think,
without great dishonour vnto God, that any one iot or tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
much lesse any maine point of doctrine deliuered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
is superfluous for the Church of God: specially seeing
God himselfe hath told vs, that <hi>the things re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ealed belong to
vs, and to our children for euer:</hi> And againe, that <hi>whatsoeuer
things are written, are written for our learning.</hi> Seeing then this
doctrine of Predestination and Election, is not onely layd
downe, but often repeated and inculcated in the Word of
God: Why should wee be wiser then God, to conceale that
from Gods people, which God will haue both vs to teach,
and them in due time and season to learne, and beleeue?<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 29. 29.</note>

            <p>Now for the difficulties which in this case they pretend, I
can not in truth deny; but that as euery Article of our faith,
so specially this, may iustly seeme hard and obscure vnto vs,
whose knowledge is darkned with infinit mists both of our
naturall, and of that habituall ignorance which wee haue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnto it. But we are all to bee so farre from being dismaid
herewith, that this should rather be a spurre vnto vs, to stirre
vs vp euery day to growe and increase in the knowledge of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9500:5"/>
God, and of his Word, that so we might more plainely both
discern our selues, and be able to instruct others in that truth,
and point out vnto them euery part of that path which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vnto euerlasting life. Yet let vs euen herein also behold
and admire the wisedome and the mercies of our most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
God, that howsoeuer those things, for the continuall
exercise of Gods children, are wrapped vp in sundry difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
so that an Elephant may swimme therein; yet, withall,
they are so tempered by Gods Spirit, and fitted for our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
that neither this, nor any one point of all our faith is
without such euident &amp; cleere proofes in the Word of God,
as that for the most a Lambe may wade in them, and for
them all, such as best serue for the instructing of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

euill report of the Land, causing the people to be faint-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and murmure against the Lord: So these men, hauing
like diligent Spyes, considered and viewed euery part of this
doctrine, know right well, that it is a doctrine of exceeding
comfort, and that it floweth with Milke and Hony; but
they bring an euill report vpon it, and vpon the Word of
God, when they affray Gods people from entring hereunto,
with the greatnesse of those difficulties, as it were with so
many Gyants and sonnes of <hi>Anak,</hi> which they haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Let vs goe vp at once, and possesse the Land, for vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we shall ouercome it. Let vs then in the name and feare of
God enter into this doctrine, beeing guided though not
with <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> yet with the Prophets and Apostles,
and euen led by the hand of our Sauiour Christ: who all by
their teaching and preaching of this doctrine, haue chalked
out the way vnto vs, how we may enter into it, and take full
possession of those ioyes, and comforts, which are contained
in the knowledge and meditation thereof.</p>
            <p>In handling this doctrine of Election, I commend to your
godly consideration these three points, out of these words of
the Apostle. The first, <hi>our Election it selfe.</hi> The second, the
<hi>certainty and assurance of our Election;</hi> both of them set down
in these words, <hi>Giue all diligence to make your Election sure.</hi>
The third, the <hi>meanes of this assurance,</hi> one of which beeing
sanctitie, and holinesse of life, the Apostle expresseth in these
words: For <hi>if yee doe these things, ye shall neuer fall.</hi> Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Election it selfe, two things are to be obserued. First, the
<hi>parties who are Elected:</hi> Secondly, <hi>the cause of their Election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the <hi>parties elected,</hi> I shall not need to stay long

               </note> that <hi>Gods election before the world is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
to all men,</hi> so that euery one is alike chosen by him vnto

repugnant euen to common sence, and reason. For who doth
not know, that to elect, or chuse, implyeth a reiecting and
refusing of some others? This very word of Election signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
nothing else, but a separating and culling out of some
from the rest, as our Sauiour saith<note n="r" place="margin">Ioh. 15. 19.</note> of his Disciples, that hee

chose them out of the world. Seeing then it is most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is, that God separated them for a peculiar people vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and pickt them out from the rest, which he refused, and
left in their sinne, to be led by their owne lusts into that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
which is ordained for them.</p>
            <p>Now as errOur neuer wanteth some colour and shew of
truth; so these men, to maintaine this fancy, alledge<note n="t" place="margin">Confut. of the carelesse. Sect. 15.</note> the

follow, that he did also predestinate, and elect <hi>them all</hi> vnto

                  </gap>ight,</hi> and <hi>all things are naked and open to
his eyes:</hi> the other is a knowledge of <hi>louing and liking,</hi> which
the Schoolemen rightly tearme a <hi>knowledge of approbation;</hi> of
which it is said, <hi>Psal. 1. 6. The Lord knoweth the wayes of the
righteous:</hi> not onely the seeing and beholding them, for so
he doth know the wayes of the wicked also: but he knoweth
the wayes of the righteous, by louing, allowing, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their wayes, in which sort hee neuer knoweth the way
of any wicked man, seeing both himselfe, and his wayes, are
an abomination vnto God. Now it is most certain that all
men, euen the Reprobate, are foreknown of God, by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
kinde of knowledge; for <hi>all things are manifest and naked
before his eyes.</hi> But this knowledge of apprehension can not
possibly be ment by the Apostle in the 8. to the <hi>Romans.</hi> For
whom God <hi>knoweth</hi> in that place, them he both iustifyeth in
this, and gLorifieth in the life to come, as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely
witnesseth in the same place. Now seeing hee doth
<pb facs="tcp:9500:6"/>
not iustifie and glorifie all, but will say to some, Goe into
euerlasting fire, who shall haue their portion in that Lake
which burneth with fire And brimstone; it remaineth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the Apostle speaketh not of that former <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of apprehension,</hi> but of the later of <hi>approbation,</hi> by which
I may truely say vnto you, that God neuer knew any Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
or vngodly person; our Sauiour teaching in plaine
tearmes the same, <hi>Mat. 7. 23. Then will I professe to them, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

in the <hi>will</hi> of God; the <hi>conditionall part</hi> whereof, is euer since
the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> reuealed and published vnto men, that hee
will in mercy pardon and saue <hi>all those, and onely those who doe

affirme, that they doe most fitly, and euen subordinately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
one with the other, which that we may perceiue; The
whole will of God, concerning mens saluation and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9500:11"/>
may bee fitly set downe in a reason, or <hi>demonstration,</hi>
drawne from the effect, to the cause. The <hi>proposition</hi> whereof
is this, Whosoeuer shall beleeue in Christ, and liue in pietie,
them hath God elected, and them <hi>will be</hi> haue to be saued; but
whosoeuer doe not beleeue, nor liue in piety, them hath hee
reiected, and <hi>will</hi> in the end condemne. And all this is reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto vs, and it is the summe, or effect, of his whole <hi>reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
will.</hi> The <hi>Assumption</hi> which God maketh, is this; But these
and these men will beleeue, for <hi>I will</hi> worke faith and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in their hearts: those and the other doe not, nor will they
beleeue, nor liue in pietie; for I will harden them, as I harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> not giuing my grace, nor working faith and
sanctitie in them: And this is part of the <hi>secret will</hi> of God,
not reuealed vnto vs, but onely in the elect themselues, and
some few whom God hath witnessed in his Word, either to
be heires of life, or to be partakers of eternall death. Of these
two <hi>premises,</hi> which are parts, the one of the <hi>reuealed,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the <hi>secret</hi> will, this <hi>conclusion</hi> is inferred, which is the
<hi>absolute decree</hi> of God: Therefore these and these haue I elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and will in mercy saue: Those and the other haue I refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and will at the last day in iustice condemne, and cast into
euerlasting fire. Thus you see, that the one will doth no way
contrary the other; but with a sweet harmony they both
concurre in one <hi>Demonstration,</hi> wherein from the <hi>effect of
Gods will,</hi> which in giuing his grace is our beleeuing, and in
not giuing his grace, is our not beleeuing, wee proceed vnto
the cause of both, which is the <hi>absolute will of God</hi> in electing
these; and the <hi>absolute will of God,</hi> in reiecting, or leauing the
others.</p>

that he hath not only power, but euen <hi>authoritie &amp; a rightfull
power;</hi> (for so the word <gap reason="foreign">

he excell the clay, yet still the oddes and difference <hi>is finite.</hi>
But God <hi>infinitely</hi> excelleth all mankinde; and therefore his
authoritie is <hi>infinitely more</hi> ouer vs all, then is the Potter ouer
the least parcell of Clay. Yea, thou thy selfe wilt, for thy own
<hi>pleasure, sport, or glory,</hi> kill and slay of thy Deere, and fat of
thy beasts, which thou wilt, for slaughter: and yet because
thou thinkest <hi>they are thy owne,</hi> death it were for any of thy

               <hi>cur ita facis?</hi> yet thy beasts had no way offended thee,
but beene good and seruiceable vnto thee, so that thou hadst
onely the power of <hi>a Lord</hi> ouer them, but thou hadst no
cause of <hi>wrath and anger</hi> against them: How much more
may the Almighty, for his glory, designe or leaue which of
all mankinde he pleaseth, for the day of slaughter; seeing
both, they all had by their <hi>rebellion against God,</hi> incensed his
<hi>wrath,</hi> and prouoked his <hi>iust indignation</hi> against them; and
hee being the <hi>Lord of all Lords,</hi> and Creator of heauen and

            <p>Lastly, if God had beene <hi>indebted vnto thee,</hi> or <hi>bound to
shew thee mercy and fauour,</hi> then mightst thou haue had some
cause to complaine of his wrong. But the Almighty did
owe thee nothing, nor was he <hi>obliged</hi> to shew thee the least
fauour. And though hee was not, yet, to leaue thee vvithout
all excuse, hee enriched thee with his free bounty, and thou
hadst greatly tasted of his fauours, in that hee gaue thee <hi>thy
being,</hi> when hee might haue suffered thee to continue in

               <hi>Nothing:</hi> in that he made thee a <hi>man,</hi> when, if it had pleased
him, hee might haue made thee <hi>a beast;</hi> yea, haue made thee
<hi>a Toad:</hi> and especially in that hee created thee after <hi>his owne
image,</hi> decking thee with <hi>righteousnesse and true bolinesse,</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thee in a most glorious and <hi>happy estate,</hi> and giuing vnto
thee <hi>free will, power and abilitie</hi> to haue continued so for euer,
if thou wouldest thy selfe. Now feeing thou, and all mankind
by their <hi>owne will and wilfull disobedience,</hi> didst depriue thy

before mentioned, caunot iustly complaine, that
the King doth wrong him, because he did not pardon him,

Whence also may fully be cleered the iustice of God, in
his <hi>reiecting</hi> of the transgressing angels. There is, I confesse,
great oddes and difference in the reiection of them, and of
men. All mankind was included in <hi>one common roote,</hi> whence
all the rest should be propagated: so were not the angels. All
mankinde in that common <hi>roote had sinned,</hi>
               <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 5. 12. Ephes. 2. 3.</note> and willingly
depriued themselues of blessednesse, and made themselues
subiect to the eternall hatred of God: so had not the angels.
In electing men, God vsed an <hi>act of mercy; I will haue mercy
on whom I will.</hi> Now <hi>mercy</hi> presupposeth <hi>sinne and misery:</hi> so
in electing of them, God in <hi>mercy</hi> puld them out of sinne
and misery, and in <hi>mercy</hi> gaue both grace and glory vnto
them. In electing the Angels, he cannot be said to haue vsed
this <hi>Act of mercy,</hi> seeing they were then neither sinfull, nor
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9500:15"/>
miserable. His act in electing them, was onely an act of
<hi>free loue and bounty, in giuing such grace vnto them, as that they

<hi>positiue,</hi> decreeing, for that sin into which they wilfully now

Christ would not put them away, yet either themselues, or
some other, might take them from him; hee addeth further,

them out of mine hand.</hi> If not any, then not the World, nor
the Flesh, nor Satan with all the powers of darknes, no nor
they themselues, shall bee able to plucke themselues from
Christ, or take them out of his Fathers hand. And lest wee
should thinke that though they cannot be pluckt, or by force
drawne from Christ, yet by some subtiltie, or craft of Satan,
they might be ensnared, and, as it were, stolne from him, our

to deceiue any one of his Elect; because it is impossible by

neither any force or violence shall bee able <hi>to pull them</hi> out

seeing the <hi>foreknowledge of God is without all errour,

perswade either themselues, or others, to this care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,

               </gap>e of their eternall

            <p>But if laying aside the pride and wantonnesse of their

reason to the wisedome of God, they should easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,
how their whole dispute in this, and all like cases,
relyeth on no other stay, then a broken staffe of Reede.
For did God either <hi>foreknow</hi> or <hi>fore-ordaine</hi> any of these
<hi>ends,</hi> without respect vnto the <hi>meanes,</hi> which doe infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly

that himselfe will make him to embrace those
<hi>meanes,</hi> and walke in those wayes which will bring him
vnto life: and seeing hee neither <hi>decreeth</hi> nor <hi>foreknoweth</hi>
the damnation of any, but of the same hee decreeth, and
foreknoweth, that he <hi>will leaue</hi> them destitute of his grace,
to be led by their owne lusts into sinne and impenitency,
which is the infallible <hi>meanes</hi> to bring them vnto death:
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> most cleerely hence followeth, that as none doe neglect

so neither doe any euer faile to attaine the <hi>end,</hi> who doe
embrace the <hi>meanes</hi> that lead therevnto. Whence it comes
to passe, that though none of the Elect can either misse
of the <hi>end,</hi> or neglect the <hi>meanes</hi> of saluation, God by
his grace directing them in the one, and thereby leading
them vnto the other; yet vpon that suposall which
they make, if they should not beleeue, nor vse the <hi>meanes</hi>
of life, it may, yea, it must be said, that they should neuer
attaine to to the <hi>end,</hi> but eternally perish. Euen as Saint

               <hi>him also, that all who were with him in that dangerous

yet when the Mariners, who were to bee the
<hi>meanes</hi> of their safety, were ready to fly away, and leaue
the rest to the rage of the sea, hee <hi>conditionally and truely</hi>
said, that <hi>if the Mariners abode not in the ship:</hi> that is, if

God, there could none of them be safe: notwithstanding
both the <hi>Decree, Praescience,</hi> and <hi>Prediction</hi> of GOD for
their safety. Againe, though in respect of Gods immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Decree and Praescience,</hi> it bee simply impossible, that
any of the Reprobate should either beleeue, repent, and
leade a sanctified life, or bee saued; yet euen of such it
may and must bee sayd, that if they performe those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which are the <hi>meanes</hi> of life, they shall asluredly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnto the <hi>end</hi> to which those meanes doe leade, which
is eternall saluation. Euen as our Sauiour, though hee
knew that God had decreed concerning <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi>
two heathenish, proud, and prophane Cities, that neither
himself would worke those singes among them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

that they should either repent or bee saued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

much preserre the glory of his God, before the good

that which <hi>C. Blassius</hi> answered,<note n="e" place="margin">Cic. lib. de Amicit.</note> but very ill, concerning

his loue towards his friend <hi>Gracchus,</hi> that most fitly besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
our loue towards God: When hee once said, that
hee so much esteemed his friend <hi>Graochus,</hi> that <hi>whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer</hi>
Gracchus <hi>would command him, hee would performe and

will you say, should wee, being vessels of honour, suffer

<hi>separated for euer</hi> from God? I may heere assuredly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere

nor can God euer wish that hurt or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

if hee should require it, and if it were possible, thereby to
gaine him honour and glory, wee should not refuse, no

of our election, which is the firmenesse and certainty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in it selfe.</p>
            <p>When first this Scripture did offer it selfe vnto my
minde, it was my speciall purpose and desire to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
of that which hath not yet beene once touched;
namely, of that other assurance of election which is in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of our selues,</hi> wherein is contained the greatest trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of our spirituall comfort. But God, you see, hath so
disposed of my labours, that I haue onely at this time, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
as it were, ouer <hi>the Red Sea,</hi> and thorow the <hi>wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,</hi>
and but entered or taken possession in the <hi>common
and generall right</hi> of Gods children, of that <hi>good land,</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the way with diuers <hi>sonnes of</hi> Anak; all which, by
the power and strength of our God wee haue put to flight
this day. When God shall grant mee opportunitie, I shall

be desirous, according as God shall enable mee, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
also that best and most blessed act of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> which
is, to <hi>diuide this good Land</hi> among Gods Children, and by
assuring euery one of them <hi>in particular of their owne electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
set each of them, as it were, in the blessed and peaceable
possession of his <hi>owne portion</hi> in this heauenly inheritance:
meane time and euer, I commend vs all to the grace, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
and mercy of our God; to whom bee ascribed
by all, and in all places, all honour, praise, and
