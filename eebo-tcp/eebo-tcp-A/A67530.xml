            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Got by some Yeoman, or the Parish Priest;</l>
               <l>Who strengthen'd by <hi>March</hi> Beer, fat Beef, and Pork,</l>
               <l>Is pleas'd sometimes to do his Neighbour's Work:</l>
               <l>The doubtful Offspring is, with Cost and Care,</l>
               <l>Train'd up at School, until his Fifteenth Year;</l>

               <l>To construe <hi>Lilly</hi>'s Rules, and Cast-Account.</l>
               <l>Design'd a Parson, but the hopeful Lad,</l>
               <l>By kinder Fortune's destin'd to a Trade:</l>
               <l>Where darling Int'rest is alone carest,</l>
               <l>And the least Merit always thrives the best.</l>
               <l>In Leathern Breeches, and a course gray Coat,</l>
               <l>With Shooe-ties made of Thongs, to Town he's brought,</l>
               <l>In Waggon, or on Carriers gall'd Horse back,</l>
               <l>Mounted like <hi>Northern Tike</hi> upon a Pack.</l>
               <l>His Friends seek out, some crafty Dealer's found,</l>
               <l>To whom the Youth is, after liking, Bound;</l>
               <l>In hopes to learn from the experienc'd Knave,</l>
               <l>To Buy, to Sell, to Cozen, Gain, and Save;</l>
               <l>Fir'd with old <hi>Whittington</hi>'s Prosperity,</l>
               <l>He hopes to be Lord-Mayor as well as he,</l>

Thus by Friends Counsel, and his own consent,</l>
               <l>Seven <hi>junior</hi> Years in Servitude are spent,</l>
               <l>Beneath a subtle crabbed Master's Care,</l>
               <l>Whose cunning Frauds his great Examples are;</l>
               <l>Till by Experience he expert is made,</l>
               <l>In all the sinful Myst'ries of his Trade.</l>
               <l>Thus qualified, when Time at length has broke</l>
               <l>The Bonds that bound him to his servile Yoke,</l>

               <l>And with a formal stiffness ev'ry thing out-does.</l>
               <l>The Coin she brings sets up the crafty Blade,</l>
               <l>Careful t'improve the Int'rest of his Trade;</l>
               <l>For Wedlock's Woes, and wealthy Cares design'd,</l>

               <l>Thus settled in a thriving part o'th' Town,</l>
               <l>With cautious Steps he prosp'rously goes on,</l>

               <l>Or false Assertions that can serve his End,</l>
               <l>He thinks by Custom are as lawful grown,</l>

               <l>Watchful behind his Compter he appears,</l>

               <l>His vacant Minutes in his Shop he spends</l>
               <l>O'er News, to which he great attention lends;</l>
               <l>Till he by reading <hi>Gazetts</hi> is become,</l>

                  <l>Whilst he bemoans the number of his Years.</l>
                  <l>He Sighs, and does, with wishful Eyes, behold</l>
                  <l>His Piles of Silver, and vast Sums of Gold:</l>
                  <l>But with an anxious Breast, and troubled Thought,</l>
                  <l>Groaning, remembers how 'twas basely got.</l>
                  <l>The Curses of old Age, the <hi>Gout</hi> and <hi>Stone,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Torment the Wretch for the past Ills he'as done.</l>
                  <l>Who for sweet Ease sollicits Heav'n in vain,</l>
                  <l>And grows almost a Christian thro' his Pain.</l>
                  <l>Still greater Mis'ries ev'ry Hour accrue,</l>
                  <l>And the pale Foe draws nearer to his view:</l>
                  <l>His Nerves grow weak, and his Distempers strong,</l>
                  <l>His Intervals more short, his Pains more long,</l>
                  <l>His fleshy Sides from City Banquets drawn,</l>
                  <l>He finds consum'd into a Skeleton.</l>
                  <l>His Appetite is gone, his Breath grown short,</l>
                  <l>And all his lively Thoughts turn'd <hi>al-a-mort.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Thus in these Conflicts he begins to Rave,</l>
                  <l>Devided 'twixt his Treasure and the Grave:</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Have I my Life in Care and Slav'ry spent,</hi>

                  <l>
