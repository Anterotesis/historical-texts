            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Letter to my Lord Generall,
concerning BRISTOLL.</head>
            <opener>May it pleaſe your Excellencie.</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the ſurrender of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> (of
which I deſire to give an account
before a Councell of War) I could
not get any means to ſend to your
Excellencie; and I would not have
written at this time, but have my
ſelfe waited upon your Excellencie,
but that I finde it neceſſary for me
to ſtay here a day or two, to cleare my ſelfe of ſuch aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
as are moſt unworthily laid upon me in this Citie,
when I kept the Town ſo farre beyond the enemies expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
that they began to beleeve we had gotten ſome
freſh forces into the Citie, and held a ſolemne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
of warre (the reſults whereof I have, being found in
Colonell <hi>Burkes</hi> pocket, whom we ſlew amongſt divers
other Colonels and Officers of qualitie) whether they
ſhould proceed to fall upon the town by way of aſſault,
or by way of approach. My Lord, I held that large
Town with a handful of men againſt a greater Armie then
ever yet the King had together, foure dayes, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
almoſt aſſaulted both by day and by night, and
ſtormed by them in eight or nine places together, in ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
manner, as the like was never yet done in <hi>England,</hi>
and the loſſe that they have received, doth teſtifie as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53560:3"/>
much: For there are neere a thouſand of them ſlain and
maimed, beſides a great many of their chiefe Officers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt, Coll-<hi>Lunsford,</hi> Coll. <hi>Buck,</hi> Coll. <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanian,</hi>
Sir <hi>Nicholas Slaning,</hi> and divers others, and yet
we loſt not above eight men in ſervice, and none of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The enemy was provided with all ſorts of Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
as Granadoes, Fire-pikes and the like, and with
Waines full of Faggots, and broad Scaling Ladders,
whereon foure or ſix might climb up on a breaſt, and they
made uſe of all thoſe in a moſt deſperate way, driving
their wains of faggots into the ditches, and climbing up
with their Fire pikes and granadoes in their hands, to the
very portalls of our great Ordnance, yet they were beaten
back in 8 or 9 places together, and entred only in one place
where the works were not perfected, there being no ditch
as yet made, nor any foot-bank within ſide the breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works;
notwithſtanding all this, and that they had entred
the ſuburbs, and drawn the whole body of their foot to
that place, yet our Souldiers ſallied out both Horſe and
Foot upon them, as they lay in the ſuburbs, and beat them
back from ſtreet to ſtreet an hour and halfe together; but
being overlaid with freſh companies, one ſeconding ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
wherein we were not able to anſwer them, though
they beat the enemy back moſt courageouſly at the firſt;
inſomuch that many of them ran away, threw down their
Arms, and cried for quarter, yet being long overborn with
freſh men which the enemy ſtill drew down upon them,
they were forced to retreat into the town; and then and
not till then, the Souldiers began to be diſheartned, and
whether out of wearineſſe, or being diſcouraged, having
been 5 dayes &amp; nights together conſtantly upon duty, and
in fight without any reliefe (for we could make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
they began to ſlink away from their Colours and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53560:3"/>
Guards, and get into houſes, do what their Officers could,
ſo that of 14. Companies, I could not make 120 men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I proclaimed that all thoſe that were upon the
Guards, ſhould repaire to their Guards; and thoſe that
were not, ſhould repaire to the Marſh, and that there they
ſhould receive both money and victuals, but I could
not get them to their Colours or Guards, although the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
lay ready on the other ſide of the Key (which at
low water, which then it began to be, may be waded over)
to fall over into the Town, and no doubt in that condition
that our guards were then in, both upon the Key, and in
the Marſh, they might in leſſe then halfe an houre, have
fallen into the Town by force, and uſed their pleaſures
both upon the Souldiers and upon the Citizens. Finding
our ſelves in this condition, I called a councell of warre,
at which alſo Sir <hi>John Horner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stevens,</hi> and other
Gentlemen of the Countrey, were preſent, I propoſed to
them our condition, and beſides laid open to them, what
ſtore we had of Ammunition, that we had not of powder
above 25 French barrels; and of match for above a dayes
ſpace; that the Caſtle it ſelfe, the works not being finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was not tenable above a day or two, for that the maine
wall would be battered in two ſeverall places, and that we
had no expectation of reliefe againſt ſuch a potent Army
wherewith we were beſieged, in one, two or three workes.
At the ſame inſtant, Mr. Major, and the Sheriffes did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
intreat us, that ſeeing we could not keep the place,
we would not ruine ſo famous a Citie to no purpoſe, nor
expoſe ſo many mens perſons and eſtates to violence and
plundering. Vpon all theſe conſiderations, it was unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly
reſolved, that we ſhould entertain a treaty with the
enemy; and that if we could have reaſonable conditions,
that it were far better to ſave ſo many Commanders and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53560:4"/>
Souldiers both of Horſe and Foot, and ſo many honeſt
mens perſons and eſtates, as well of our friends in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as of Gentlemen and others that came out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
adjacent, then to expoſe them all to deſtruction by
attempting in a furious and mad way to defend the towne
or Caſtle for two or three dayes (if we could have held it
ſo long) without any hope of holding them any longer,
for I will put it upon that iſſue, and without any hope or
expectation of any reliefe within that time, or a longer
time after. Vpon the treaty all things almoſt which we
demanded, we obtained, excepting the Arms of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldiers, and our Colours, which being poynts of
honour, I was reſolved to have inſiſted upon, and ſo we
brake off for a while. But upon the earneſt ſuit of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
and Citizens, and others, called together my Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and fell into a ſerious debate concerning it. And
when I was very reſolute not to quit the point, very many
of my Captains came in and told us, that they could not
get ſix of their Companies together, and that they ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
apace to the enemy over the Key, it being now low
water; whereby they not only ſhewed to the enemy, that
our men were diſheartned, and that they ſhould have found
but ſlender oppoſition; but alſo they ſhewed them the
way how they might readily fall over into the Towne, ſo
ſoon as the treaty ſhould break off, which undoubtedly
they had done, and given us little leave to retreat into the
Caſtle, or any where elſe, I muſt confeſſe this Caſtle the
ballance in my thoughts, that cauſed me to yeeld to that
Article, which otherwiſe I would never have done, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that we ſhould quickly find Armes againe, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the hoſes and men of my Regiment of horſe and
foot (which had conditions been kept with me, I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.)
I have given your Excellence a true account of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53560:4"/>
the carriage of this unhappy buſineſſe, and of the cauſes of
the ſurrendring of that Citie and Caſtle, together with
the conditions whereupon they were yeelded up. All
which being conſidered and proved, as it ſhall, by many
witneſſes, againſt whom there can be no exception, I hope
I ſhall not only ſtand clear in your Lordſhips eyes, and the
eyes of all the world, but that it ſhall be acknowledged,
that I have done moſt faithfull ſervice to thoſe by whom I
have been entruſted; and that in truth (which every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
man ſees) the unhappy diſaſter which befell Sir
<hi>William Wallers</hi> Army, did neceſſarily involve the fate of
<hi>Briſtol,</hi> both becauſe I had unfurniſhed the Citie with men
and Ammuuition, to ſupply that Army: and it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for me ſo to do, becauſe the City was never put into
a condition to ſubſiſt of it ſelfe againſt a Royall Army, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I was not wanting to repreſent the importance of
the place, and the means how it might be defended in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
propoſitions which I long ſince ſent to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and which were by your Excellency earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to the Committee, but they were not brought to
any effect. What my care and pains hath been to preſerve
that Citie, having the whole burthen thereof for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
of Men, Arms, Ammunition, and all ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
caſt upon me, having armed 3000 foot, and 300
horſe, and paid conſtantly 2000 foot and a Regiment of
Horſe, for foure or five moneths together, without ever
having above 4000 pounds from the Parliament, and
1700l. of the cuſtome moneyes: What hath been my toil
and labour to get moneyes for theſe uſes, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the Parliament, how little advantage I have made
for my ſelfe, how ready I have been to furniſh Sir <hi>W. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi>
with Men, Arms, Ammunition, Money, and all ſorts of
proviſion, (that I may ſay nothing of the hundreds of his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53560:5"/>
maimed Souldiers that have been caſt upon my care and
charge) I leave to my greateſt enemies to ſpeak the truth:
for I know there cannot be found in the world ſo great
malice as to deny it; and I appeal to him that knowes all
things, to judge between me and thoſe that expect a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tale of brick from me, and will not affoord me ſtraw
wherewithall to make it; and I ſhall appeal to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and all indifferent men, whether more could have
been done by me, when as after the defeat of Sir <hi>W. Wallers</hi>
Army, I had left onely 700 men to defend that Citie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
two ſuch Armies as came aginſt it, nor ſo much as
one peny of money to raiſe more men, provide Armes, or
pay thoſe men I had already; yet God inabled me in five
dayes, to raiſe and Arm 1000 men more, and with thoſe
1700 men, and that Ammunition I had left, I made that
defence that I have done, of which I am ſure I ſhall never
have cauſe to be aſhamed of, nor do I beleeve that your
Lordſhip will be aſhamed to own me ſtill, as</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou heard laſt weeke of the affrights and terrours
which the prevailing faction in the pretended
<hi>Houſes</hi> were fallen into, by reaſon of the ſad
condition of their affaires in moſt parts abroad;
and ſhall now heare of the confuſions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
they are in at home: the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Houſe</hi>
bandying againſt the <hi>Lower,</hi> the <hi>Lower</hi> at a rupture amongſt
themſelves, and the Army in as great diſtemper as both the
Houſes. For it was certified this day (and had beene rumoured
two or three dayes before) that the Lords had ordered that the
Earle of <hi>Portland</hi> and the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> ſhould be <hi>bayled</hi>
(whom formerly they had committed upon a generall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment
from the Houſe of <hi>Commons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>) And though it was
much preſſed by Maſter <hi>Strode<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that <hi>There would be no ſitting
for them, if thoſe Lords were releaſed and reſtored to the freedome
of their Votes againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> yet the <hi>Order</hi> ſtood, and the two Lords
were bayled accordingly: foure of the <hi>Peeres</hi> which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had dearely cheriſhed the proceedings of that <hi>Houſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bound for them; which added much unto the heat and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:53560:6"/>
of their diſcontent. As alſo that two Bills being ſent up to
the Lords, the one for levying the eſtates of all whom they ſtile
<hi>Malignants,</hi> according to the newly enlarged <hi>Ordinance</hi> for
<hi>Sequeſtrations;</hi> the other for the continuance of the weekely
Aſſeſſements, were both rejected by that Houſe. Which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Maſter <hi>Martyn</hi> to propoſe, as he had done before on the
like occaſions, that they would paſſe them of themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Lords, whoſe ſuffrage and conſent he conceived as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
as the Kings in things pertaining to the <hi>Commons:</hi>
but wiſer heads thought fitter to paſſe by the motion, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now in no condition for ſo great a breach.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Lower Houſe</hi> it was alſo ſignified, that on the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the Houſe on Saturday <hi>July</hi> 29. Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> moved
that they would heare ſome Propoſitions from the Earle of
<hi>Eſſex:</hi> but the Houſe having all that day attended the leiſure
of the <hi>Cloſe Committee</hi> without doing any thing, would not be
perſwaded, but roſe immediately; to the great diſguſt of that
<hi>Committee,</hi> who formerly had beene looked upon with more
obſervance. But this was but the beginning of a greater ſtorme.
For at the next meeting it was moved that the <hi>Cloſe Committee</hi>
ſhould be diſſolved, many conſiderable men inveighing bitterly
againſt it, as the cauſe of all thoſe miſeries which afflict this
Kingdome. And when that could not be effected; it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
and carried at the laſt by the <hi>major</hi> part, that a <hi>Committee</hi>
ſhould be nominated to take an accompt of the <hi>Cloſe Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,</hi>
and of all others which were truſted with receipts or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſements
of money; and that none of the <hi>Cloſe Committee,</hi>
nor any which had fingered any of the publick moneys was to
have a voyce in it: it being affirmed in the Houſe, that great
ſummes of money had beene drawne from the Citie and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
(to the ſumme of three millions at the leaſt, as was before
alleadged) whereof although the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
300000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, <hi>Waller</hi> and <hi>Fairefax</hi> both not above 30000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, yet
the Armies were continually in want of pay. And though
<hi>Strode</hi> and others of the <hi>Cloſe Committee</hi> did oppoſe it openly,
ſaying, <hi>it called that power in queſtion which had beene given
them by the Houſe;</hi> and uſed all cunning Artifices, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:53560:6"/>
devices not to have it paſſe; yet it was carried in the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Lords concurring alſo in it, and nominating a <hi>Committee</hi> of
their <hi>Houſe</hi> to the ſame intent. Which hath begot ſuch true
<hi>fears</hi> &amp; <hi>jealouſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp; raiſed ſuch a diſtruſt of one another, that it is
thought the <hi>Houſes</hi> will be too hot for ſome potent Members,
who heretofore did governe the affaires of both, and were as
uncontroulable amongſt them there, as ever were the <hi>Tribunes</hi>
in the State of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſt of all for the <hi>Armies,</hi> it was thus advertiſed that the
Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> finding himſelfe abuſed in Pictures, cenſured in
Pulpits, diſhonoured in the table-talke of the common people,
and a deſigne on foot of raiſing a new Army, under the conduct
of Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> which would ſoone put an end unto his
authority, made complaint of it to the <hi>Lords,</hi> by them to be
communicated to the other <hi>Houſe:</hi> requiring that his Army be
forthwith paid, and furniſhed with cloathes and all other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
his broken and diſeaſed Forces preſently <hi>recruited,</hi>
reparation to be given him in point of honour, for all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
and ſcandals which falſely (as he ſaith) have been laid
upon him, that <hi>Waller</hi> be called to an accompt for the loſſe of
his Forces in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> and finally, that no <hi>Commiſſion</hi> may be
iſſued out to any one to have the charge and conduct of any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but by his authority. Which bold demands, though very
unwelcome to the Citie-faction in the <hi>Lower Houſe,</hi> who had
reſolved otherwiſe amongſt themſelves; yet the Lords <hi>ordered</hi>
for their parts (referring the payment and clothing of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to the care of the <hi>Commons</hi>) that his Army ſhould be firſt
<hi>recruited</hi> before any other Forces raiſed, that he and his Army
ſhould have reparation by a Declaration of both Houſes, for all
the ſcandals vented againſt them, that the miſcarriage of the
buſineſſe in the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſhould be examined, and the blame laid on
thoſe whom it did belong to; and finally, that whoſoever was
appointed to any charge or command, ſhould take his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
from his <hi>Excellencie</hi> onely, and depend on him; and that
he ſhould have power to call backe ſuch <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> as hee
ſaw occaſion. And it is further certified, that though theſe
<hi>Votes</hi> may give content unto the <hi>Generall,</hi> which was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:53560:7"/>
moſt intended, yet doe they yet much diſpleaſe the faction
in the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> and infinitely diſtaſt the <hi>Citizens,</hi> who
are reſolved to raiſe neither men nor money, if <hi>Waller</hi> may not
have ordering and diſpoſing of them, and this they ſticking not
to ſay openly as they walke the Streetes. And on the other
ſide, <hi>Waller,</hi> and thoſe who have before ſerved under him are ſo
inraged by theſe <hi>Votes,</hi> that an implacable and deadly <hi>feud</hi> is
very like to grow amongſt them, ſo as there is ſome hope
when theſe plundering <hi>theeves once fall out, true men will come
the ſooner to their goods.</hi>

               <head>MONDAY. <hi>Aug.</hi> 7.</head>
               <p>We have beene long in the intelligence of the former day, but
ſhall be breifer in the next; the moſt of which comes from
<hi>London</hi> alſo. For it was certified from thence, that they were
more diſanimated at the loſſe of <hi>Briſtol</hi> (when firſt the newes
was ſuffered to be knowne amongſt them) then at all their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
loſſes in the North and Weſt; and that aſſoone as the newes
came unto the Houſes, the prevalent faction there gave <hi>Exeter</hi>
for as good as loſt, eſpecially ſince the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> was
come thence with his fleete, and had done nothing towards the
releife of it, but added much unto their deſperate condition by
being ſo ſhamefully repulſed. And it was alſo certified that they
had other feares which did more afflict them, upon the ſight of
certaine letters from the Major of <hi>Plimmouth</hi> to the Earle of
<hi>Warwicke,</hi> in which was ſignified that Sir <hi>Alexander Carew,</hi> and
Maſter <hi>Thomas Arundell</hi> their Governours of the Fort &amp; Iſland
of <hi>Plimmouth,</hi> were ſuſpected to incline unto the King: which
did ſo ſtartle them, that preſently they cauſed letters to be ſent
unto them, commanding them as Members of the Houſe of
<hi>Commons</hi> to returne to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to doe their ſervice to the
<hi>Houſe.</hi> But it was thought the Gentlemen had heard too much
of <hi>Hotham,</hi> to put themſelves into their hands, who ſhew ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
favour unto thoſe that deſerved beſt of them in their preſent
Rebellion.</p>
               <p>It was alſo certified from <hi>Briſtol</hi> that for a ſpeedier ending
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:53560:7"/>
of the ſiege of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the totall reducing of the Weſt under
His Majeſties command, (that ſo his Armies might unite for
ſome other ſervice) Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with the <hi>Corniſh</hi> forces and
ſome troopes of horſe, with many gallant Gentlemen who would
needes attend him in the Action, was gone towards <hi>Devonſhire;</hi>
whoſe going thither, as it was generally conceived, would
quickely put an end to that buſineſſe. As alſo that for the ſetling
of the affaires of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> His Majeſty had made that noble and
deſerving Gentleman Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> Governour of the towne
and Caſtle; and under him, that valiant Colon. <hi>VVaſhington</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Governour of the Caſtle, to the generall content of all men.</p>
               <p>It was alſo ſignified from <hi>London,</hi> that this laſt weeke hath
beene a terrible weeke of newes to that falling faction. For
beſides the deadly newes from <hi>Briſtol</hi> (the loſſe whereof doth
more aſtoniſh them then all the reſt of their misfortunes in the
North and Weſt) and that they have given <hi>Exeter</hi> for as good
as loſt: they have beene miſerably vexed with Letters from
<hi>Glouceſter, Coventry,</hi> and <hi>Warwicke,</hi> complaining of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
wants, but ſpecially of the backwardneſſe of the people
to make good thoſe places, or contribute to the worke, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
ſince this change of things; and plainly ſignifying, that
unleſſe ſpeedy ſupplies be ſent of Men, Armes, and Money,
(neither of which the pretended Houſes can afford them at the
preſent time) they are not able to hold out againſt His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Forces, but of neceſſity muſt give up thoſe Townes on the
firſt aſſault.</p>

            <div type="day">
               <head>TUESDAY. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 8.</head>
               <p>It was advertiſed this day that the prevailing party in the
Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> had refuſed to concurre to many of the
<hi>Votes,</hi> which had beene paſſed by the Lords in favour of the
Earle of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> which breedes ill bloud, not onely betwixt
them and the Lords, but betwixt the Soldierie and them: and
that conſidering that no Commiſſion muſt be granted but by and
from the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the <hi>Independent</hi> Army which was ſo
much talked of, is come to nothing; inſomuch that Sir <hi>William
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:53560:8"/>
Waller</hi> hath not yet liſted above 600 of the 20000 which the
City promiſed him. And it is further certified that the towne
is very much divided about the buſineſſe of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> ſome impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the loſſe of it to <hi>Fines,</hi> and ſome to <hi>Waller,</hi> according as
they ſtand affected to either party: and that the diſputation
grew to ſo great an height betweene Sir <hi>William</hi> and my Lord
<hi>Say,</hi> (who you muſt thinke would not allow his ſonne to be a
<hi>Coward,</hi> though he can cheriſh him in a <hi>murther</hi>) that the lye
paſſed betweene them. As alſo, that Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> begins
to be diſcontented with his friends the Citizens, who ſo much
admired him being abſent, and promiſed him ſuch mighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
if he would honour them with his preſence. For whereas
on the firſt of this preſent <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he went into the new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery
yard to liſt thoſe multitudes of men which had long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
him; the appearance was ſo thinne and ſmall, that he
was very much aſhamed of the diſappointment. And when
the new <hi>Committee</hi> nominated in the Citie Petition, told him
that was no place to doe the feat in, but they would goe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> Hall, and appoint <hi>Commanders</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them; and then hee ſhould ſee with what alacrity the
people would come in unto him: that on the other ſide did
as much offend him, to ſee he ſhould not have the nominating
of his owne <hi>Commanders.</hi> So that, for ought we can perceive
by the preparations, the <hi>Conquerour</hi> is like to adde little to his
Weſterne victories by the Citie Army.</p>
               <p>It was advertiſed alſo that ſome of the more peaceable Lords
(to ſay no worſe) taking advantage of the ſlow ſucceſſe which
<hi>Waller</hi> found in raiſing his Army, and of their loſſes in the <hi>Weſt,</hi>
propoſed the renewing of the Treaty; deſiring that ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
might be ſent His Majeſtie, as they might reaſonably
hope would be hearkned to. Which being agreed on by the
reſt, and a Committee named for the <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> they drew
them to ſome certaine heads, ſuch as might give ſome little
ſhew of ſatisfaction to His Majeſtie, but more ſecurity unto
themſelves, and a free pardon to all thoſe who have beene ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inſtruments or Authors of this Rebellion. And yet this
pleaſed not my Lord <hi>Say,</hi> who by chance was abſent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53560:8"/>
when he came next into the Houſe, he laboured very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
to have them altered, and prevailed in it at the laſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that whereas it was firſt agreed on, that the Ships,
Forts, Townes, Magazines, and Revenues ſhould be delivered
to the King, without any condition; and if the Parliament
ſhould be adjourned to ſome other place, being the only points
in which there was any ſhew of ſatisfaction to His ſacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie;
he obtained to have both of them altered, and put into
ſuch generall termes as might beſt ſuite unto the humour of his
friends in the other <hi>Houſe.</hi> But being the buſineſſe ſtayed not
here, but brake out into greater and more publike heats; you
ſhall heare more of it after a day or two.</p>

               <head>WEDNESDAY. <hi>Aug.</hi> 9.</head>
               <p>It was advertiſed this day that the Caſtle and Iſle of <hi>Portland</hi>
(wherof S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Edw. Sydenham</hi> Knight Marſhal was &amp; is Governor)
were reduced againe under his Majeſties command, which had
beene taken by the Rebells about March laſt. The manner how
it was regained is reported thus. A Gentleman well known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Rebells</hi> which had the guard of the Caſtle, and uſed to be
much there for his owne ſafety and preſervation in theſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
times, came to the noble Earle of <hi>Carnarvon,</hi> and gave
him very good aſſurance that if he would truſt him with 60 of
his men he would forthwith make him Maſter of the Iſle and
Caſtle: the Earle conſidering that the Caſtle and Iſle were richly
worth the adventuring of 60 muskets, having taken ſo many
armes at <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> condeſcended he ſhould have them: which
being obtained the Gentleman furniſhed them with Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
colours, and making towards the Caſtle with ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
a ſpeed as if he fled from an Enemy, called upon the guards
and told them he had brought ſome Parliament forces to make
good the place; but that they were purſued ſo cloſely by the
Earle of <hi>Carnarvon;</hi> that if they had not ſpeedy entrance they
ſhould all be loſt. This was no ſooner heard by the credulous
<hi>Rebels,</hi> but all the haſt was made that could be to ſet open the
Ports: at which His Majeſties Soldiers entred, and ſeizing on
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:53560:9"/>
the guards, who looked not for ſuch unwelcome viſitants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
made themſelves maſters of it without further trouble. A place
of very great importance, as having the command of the haven
and Towne of <hi>Weymouth,</hi> againſt which it lieth, and as the caſe
then ſtood, of moſt infinite wealth, all the rich houſhold ſtuffe
and Treaſure which had beene taken by the Rebells out of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour</hi>
Caſtle with a great deale more of goods plate and money,
being ſtored up there.</p>
               <p>It was alſo certified from thoſe parts, that <hi>Poole Melcombe,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Weymouth</hi> which were in treaty with the Earle of <hi>Carnarvon</hi> (as
you heard the laſt weeke) upon the yeelding up of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi>
have ſince ſubmitted to His Majeſtie: ſo that all <hi>Dorſetſhire</hi> is
totally reduced againe to its old obedience; which cannot but
very much conduce to the diſpatch of the worke at <hi>Exeter,</hi> and
conſequently to the abſolute and finall ſetling of all the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
And it was alſo ſignified, that a ſhip of His Majeſties Navy call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Charles,</hi> being the ſhip of the ſecond ranke, had left the
Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and was come to <hi>Folmouth,</hi> according to
His Majeſties Proclamation of the 7 of <hi>July.</hi> Nor is it (in my
mind) without ſome good <hi>Omen,</hi> that the firſt ſhip of ſtrength
and burden, which did obey that invitation ſhould be the
CHARLES.</p>

               <head>THURSDAY. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> 10.</head>
               <p>It was advertiſed this day that the Lord <hi>Capell</hi> with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
appeared before the Walls of <hi>Namptwich,</hi> in hope to finde
them in a diſpoſition of returning to his Majeſties ſervice; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how His Majeſties affaires had thrived and proſpered,
not only in raiſing the ſiege of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> but in cleering of the
<hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> from the power of the Rebells. But finding
them continue in their wonted obſtinacy, he fell off againe, and
retreated ſafely to his owne quarters, with the loſſe of ſixteene
only of his men. And on the other ſide to make amends for the
defailement of this hope (for it was no more) we had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
this day, that the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> of <hi>Parham</hi> being
gone from <hi>Gainsburgh,</hi> on his redelivery of that towne, had
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:53560:9"/>
recovered <hi>Lincolne.</hi> But ſeeing an impoſſibility that either
<hi>Cromwell</hi> ſhould time enough recruit his beaten and diſtracted
forces, or that hee could receive any ſeaſonable ſupplies from
<hi>London;</hi> on the firſt newes that the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was
comming towards him, he forſooke the place, and made what
haſt he could to <hi>Boſton:</hi> leaving the City and <hi>Cloſe</hi> of <hi>Lincolne,</hi>
which he had neſted in ſo long, to be the next example (as we
have had very many lately) of Gods great mercy to His ſacred
Majeſty.</p>
               <p>It was alſo ſignified this day, that the heates in <hi>London</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſeaſon) doe ſtill increaſe; and that the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
which have late beene growing betweene the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
partie in the two <hi>Houſes,</hi> are at the laſt improved to a
<hi>ſedition,</hi> if not unto a <hi>Civill Warre</hi> amongſt themſelves. For
howſoever the Lord <hi>Say</hi> had ſo farre altered the <hi>Propoſitions,</hi>
intended by ſome peaceable Lords to be preſented to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
as to make them of a better reliſh to the <hi>Lower Houſe:</hi>
yet when they came into that <hi>Houſe,</hi> they were very eagerly
oppoſed, and the <hi>Houſe</hi> continued ſitting untill nine at night;
in hope ſuch men as durſt declare themſelves to be well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
would be wearied with their long debates; and they of
the malignant faction, might there carry matters upon that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
as they had done formerly. But finding that they ſate
it out, and carried it for the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> by the <hi>major</hi> part; they
had no other way to effect the buſineſſe, then to returne againe
to their former practices, and bring downe their City Club-men
to awe the Members of both Houſes, and repeale thoſe <hi>Votes.</hi>
And ſo accordingly they did. For the next day, being Sunday
laſt, they had ſo faſhioned and prepared their partie in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>London,</hi> that printed Bills were ſet up on the Church
dores, (and ſomewhat you muſt think was done in the <hi>Pulpits</hi>

               </p>
               <p>According to which intimation, the <hi>Rabble</hi> came in ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes,
and with ſo great clamour, that ſuch of the <hi>Lords</hi> and
<hi>Commons</hi> who had favoured the <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> were forced to
take boate and make haſt towards <hi>Kingſton,</hi> where the Earle of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> then lay with that part of his Forces, which Gods hand
and the Kings ſword had left alive: conceiving that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
of themſelves in favour of him (of which you heard at
full before) had beene ſufficient to oblige him faſt unto their
partie. But contrary to their hopes and expectation they found
him ſo reſolved for the other ſide, as they were faine to diſpoſe
otherwiſe of themſelves. And it is ſaid, that, notwithſtanding
thoſe indignities which have beene offered to him by the City

three of them: for which (and ſome other former courteſies)

one hundred and twenty, commanded by Captaine <hi>Lawſon,</hi>
which though they had ſo great advantage in number, yet
Captaine <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> very valiantly charged through them
with part of his men, (his Rere falling off from him) and with
that ſmall ſtrength maintained a ſharpe fight with them above
halfe an hower, wherein he received many wounds, and at
laſt was ſhot dead through the head, and one of his men alſo.
Of the Rebels there are at leaſt 20 ſore wounded, as by intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
from <hi>Northampton</hi> (where they are) is certified, and
five were carried away behind them dead from the place.
one left on the ground, and Captain <hi>Lawſon</hi> himſelfe wounded.

               <p>This day wee were certified by Letters from <hi>Yorke,</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
foure hundred of the Rebels of <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> came ſtealing

by Sir <hi>Francis Mackworth,</hi> he fell upon them and routed them,
killed above forty in the place, and tooke fifty, the reſt (as
they were taught) ran away, and eſcaped by the advantage of
the place.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Coventry</hi> they pull downe many houſes of the Suburbs,
and tell the people that the Kings Army is marching towards

for this day we received an expreſſe that his Majeſty yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day

Summons to the City, in theſe very words, <hi>Out of our tender
Compaſſion to Our City of</hi> Gloceſter, <hi>and that it may not receive
Prejudice by Our Army, which We cannot prevent, if We be
compelled to aſſault it, We are perſonally come before it to require
the ſame, and are graciouſly pleaſed to let all the Inhabitants of,
and all other Perſons within that City, as well Souldiers as others,
know, That if they ſhall immediatly ſubmit themſelves, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

pardon every one of them without exception; And doe aſſure them
in the word of a</hi> KING, <hi>that they nor any of them ſhall receive the
leaſt Dammage or Prejudice by our Army in their Perſons, or
Eſtates; But that we will appoint ſuch a Governour, and a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Garriſon to reſide there, as ſhall be both for the eaſe and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that City and that whole County. But if they ſhall neglect
this Profer of Grace and Favour, and compell <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s by the Power of
Our Army to reduce that place (which by the helpe of God We
doubt not We ſhall be eaſily and ſhortly able to do) they muſt thank</hi>

To this Meſſage We expect a cleere and poſitive Anſwere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

doe give leave to any Perſons ſafely to repaire to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and returne from

quietly to ſuffer them to paſſe accordingly.</hi> But this Rebellious
City anſwered, that <hi>they would obey His Majeſties commands as

the world judge if His Majeſtie could have ſent a more Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

deſperate Rebels deſerve any mercy, who after ſo many offers
do ſtill refuſe a pardon. But ſince their returning this Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

ſurely is not to keepe the City either for the KING or <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Yet His Majeſties Forces quenched the fire, and in ſpight

               <p>This day newes was brought to Town of Sir <hi>William Waller</hi>'s
extraordinary progreſſe in raiſing the great Army intended for
him. You heard before how the good women flocked to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
on Tueſday laſt, to cry out for <hi>peace;</hi> three of the which
were killed directly in the place, and thirteene or fourteene
more moſt ſhrewdly wounded. And the next day, to ſhew the
men were better ſtudied in the point then ſo, came downe ſome
5 or 6000 of the uſuall <hi>hacksters,</hi> which had beene alwayes
ready for ſuch purpoſes at a minutes warning; and they cryed
<hi>No peace.</hi> And being told by ſome who were appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
the Anſwer, that they who were for the continuance of
the <hi>Warre,</hi> (as every one of them ſeemed to be) ſhould goe to
<hi>Haberdaſhers Hall,</hi> and there liſt themſelves under the conduct
and command of Sir <hi>William Waller:</hi> it wrought ſo much upon
the courage of thoſe gallant ſpirits, (Reader, thou canſt not
chooſe but wonder at ſuch monſtrous forwardneſſe) that of
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:53560:11"/>
5000 men which would have <hi>no peace,</hi> no fewer then fifteene
ſturdy fellowes (in words at length and not in figures) liſted
their names upon the <hi>Roll</hi> to purſue the <hi>Warre.</hi> And ſome of
thoſe perhaps may ſee <hi>Glouceſter</hi> one day.</p>
               <p>It was advertiſed this day alſo, that 200 of the Rebels by the
appointment of Sir <hi>William Brereton,</hi> have laid ſiege to <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi>
Caſtle in <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> (an houſe belonging to the Lord
Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Lichfield;</hi>) the greateſt part of thoſe
who are ſhut up in it, being Ladies and Gentlewomen of that
County, who purpoſely came thither to ſecure themſelves in
theſe times of danger. And that they are ſo gallantly reſolved
upon it, that though their victuals doe begin to faile already,
<hi>they meane to ſtand upon their guard and defend the place</hi> (in
hope His Majeſtie will relieve them e're it come to that) <hi>as
long as they have horſe fleſh, water, and old leather left to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
nature.</hi> Which as it ſhewes the bravery and courage of
thoſe noble Ladies, ſo is it an infallible argument of the incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and rudeneſſe of thoſe barbarous <hi>Rebels</hi> (who regard neither
ſex nor quality of perſons) from whom the beſt that can be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for, is more unſufferable then the miſeries of <hi>warre</hi> and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>This day there came to Towne from <hi>London,</hi> the Earle of
<hi>Lindſey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Lord Great Chamberlaine of <hi>England,</hi> and Sir <hi>George
Radcliffe;</hi> the firſt tooke Priſoner at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> the ſecond
made a Priſoner by appointment of the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> at
the beginning of this Parliament: but by what meanes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
they are at liberty, is not yet made knowne to mee.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Rebels are now ſo farre vanquiſhed, that
they diſpaire of their deſignes, they reſolve (like bloudy cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards)
to make uſe of all baſe advantages, for which end they
are now beginning to ſhip away beyond ſea ſuch of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
good Subjects as are in their cuſtody; and wee were this
day informed, that <hi>Mudford</hi> alias <hi>Murford</hi> (that infamous
Browniſticall Governour of <hi>Southampton</hi>) hath this weeke
taken a learned ingenuous Gentleman one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Jones</hi> of <hi>Lincolnes
Inne,</hi> and others out of Priſon, and ſent them by ſea to <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or ſome ſuch other place as the Devill and they think fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:53560:12"/>
for their puniſhment, making the ſaid Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> to paſſe
through the ſtreets by his owne doore, but would not ſuffer
him to take leave, or ſpeake with his Wife, or any other friend
or Kinſman to furniſh him with linnen and other neceſſaries for
this unexpected voyage; and that yeſterday their brother Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
at <hi>London</hi> conveyed Colonell <hi>Goring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Sir <hi>George Sands,</hi>
Sir <hi>John Goodrick</hi> and other gentlemen (three or foure Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
full) to the water ſide on ſhip-board, there to lye under
hatches like ſlaves of <hi>Argiers,</hi> exſpecting every hower how
this barbarous bloudy faction will diſpoſe of them. Nor is
this ſtrange if you conſider their devotion, for this aforeſaid
<hi>Mudford</hi> ſent up his Levite into the pulpit at <hi>Southampton,</hi> to
move the people to take the New Covenant, who (like a Prieſt
of their Religion) fell on curſing (praying they call it) in theſe
very words <hi>Bleſſe the King, O Lord, mollifie his hard heart which
delighteth in bloud, open his eyes that he may ſee that the bloud of
thy Saints is deare in thy ſight; He is fallen from faith in thee, and
become an enemy to thy Church: Is it not He that hath ſinned
and done evill indeed? but as for theſe ſheep, what have they done?
Let thine hand, we pray thee O Lord our God, be on Him and on
His Fathers houſe, but not on thy people that they ſhould be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued.</hi>
And (to let you ſee both Prieſt and people are of the
ſame profeſſion) <hi>Saint-barbe</hi> himſelfe after he had taken the
<hi>Covenant</hi> ſaid aloud before many witneſſes, that <hi>he had rather
ſee the Kingdome in a flame, then that the King ſhould prevaile
againſt this cauſe they have undertaken.</hi> This is pure Proteſtant
Religion, ſuch as their brother <hi>Judas</hi> ſcarce findes among
the damned. And it was alſo ſignified by Letters from <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
that this aforeſaid <hi>Murford</hi> in purſuance of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
threats to the Prentiſes of <hi>South-hampton</hi> (whereof you
heard laſt weeke) for refuſing to take the rebellious new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
ſent one <hi>Thornborough, Riggs,</hi> and divers others to
<hi>Portſmouth,</hi> where they are lodged in ſuch a dungeon, as they
are not able to ſtand upright, but are forced to doe their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
acts of nature in the ſame place where the poore men
muſt make their lodging: And yet the Newes-men at <hi>London</hi>
have the impudence to tell us in print, that <hi>no body hath beene</hi>
                  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:53560:12"/>
                  <hi>puniſhed for refuſing their Covenant.</hi> And in the ſame Letters
it is advertiſed that the Maior of <hi>Southampton</hi> (a very ancient
man) is ſo over awed by this <hi>Murford,</hi> that being lately come
from the two Houſes (whoſe priſoner he hath beene theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven
weekes for his loyalty to his Soveraigne) hee muſt not
now be ſuffered to goe out of the Towne gates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldier by <hi>Murfords</hi> command forceth him backe again;
in ſuch contempt is the Kings Lieutenant amongſt this faction;
and all this out of <hi>Whitehead</hi> of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> his malice to the
Maior, becauſe he would not deliver the keyes of the Towne
to him when hee demanded them for the two Houſes; the
good old Maior (being a <hi>Jer<gap reason="illegible: broken type" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This day alſo we received a copy of <hi>Iſaack Pennington's

them <hi>to perſiſt in this warre (though they periſh in the
worke;</hi>) and tendring a forme of an Ordinance <hi>to preſſe and
force every man rich and poore</hi> (excepting ſome few) <hi>to take
Armes for this cauſe, or pay ten pounds a peece;</hi> which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
was voted, and the Petitioners had thankes returned
them from the Houſe.</p>
               <p>This day wee ſaw a printed Ordinance from the two preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Houſes, for the ſpeedy rayſing and levying of a weekly
contribution towards the maintenance of their Army, to be
paid by the ſeverall Counties and Cities of this Kingdome for
two moneths together: as for example, the Citie of <hi>Cheſter</hi>
is to pay weekly unto the two Houſes 62<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. The County of
<hi>Cornwall</hi> 625<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. The Citie of <hi>Yorke</hi> 62<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. The County of <hi>Salop</hi>

               <p>The Earle of <hi>Northampton</hi> this weeke intercepted divers
Letters from <hi>London,</hi> wherein we ſee ſuch pretty devices as

are come as far as</hi> Barwicke. Another, <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>will not
come, becauſe the Citizens have no money.</hi> Another, <hi>That all is
loſt except ſpirituall comfort.</hi> Another, <hi>That the Earle of</hi> Eſſex
<hi>would have all their Souldiers leave their Garriſons, and come
away with their Armes, leſt they be all taken by the King.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>That</hi> Glouceſter <hi>cannot be relieved.</hi> Another, <hi>That the
rotten Lords </hi>(a pretty-pretty epithete) <hi>would now have Peace.</hi>
Another, <hi>That now they muſt no longer truſt in the Parliament.</hi>
Another, <hi>That the loſſe of</hi> Briſtol <hi>hath diſcovered many falſe
hearts, who onely had creature-confidence.</hi> Another, <hi>That to
vote for peace now, was like the plot of the</hi> Trojan <hi>horſe, and like</hi>
Saul, <hi>to fly in diſtreſſe to the Witch of</hi> Endor; with a world
more of ſuch excellent expreſſions, as doe trouble me to want
paper for them.</p>
               <p>And the Printed Newes-men are this weeke turn'd Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
urging Scripture (in place of Newes) againſt fainting in
tribulation, yet ever and anon ſprinkling a lye: as 1. That <hi>the
Lord</hi> Digby <hi>hath one Troope of</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Papiſts:</hi> (My Lord
thankes you for raiſing a new Troope for him; but hee thinkes
you meane the <hi>Walloones</hi> at <hi>Fulham,</hi> allowed to have Maſſe by

<hi>Souldiers marched out of</hi> Gainsborough <hi>with all their
Armes:</hi> (You were cudgelled for this the laſt weeke, and
yet you are at it againe.) 3. That <hi>the King commands to kill
men for fearing God,</hi> (for labouring to murther him in the feare
of God; <hi>feare God, obey the Parliament.</hi>) 4. That <hi>Sir</hi> Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Waller <hi>hath many thouſands of men:</hi> (yes, at <hi>Round-way

Laſtly, That <hi>the Cloſe Committee had newes that</hi> Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,
