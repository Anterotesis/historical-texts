            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A JUST REBUKE TO SEVERAL Calumnies, Lyes &amp; Slanders Reported againſt <hi>Thomas Budd.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MAny have been the ſtratagems and devices of the old Enemy af Mankind, the Devil, to deceive the ſimple-hearted in all Ages, from the beginning, and ſtill endeavours by his Inſtruments to belye and aſperſe the Innocent; and among the reſt it hath happened to be my lot to have my ſhare in being belyed and evil ſpoken of, for no other cauſe, but my being zealous for the Faith of our dear Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, that was crurified without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> which Faith hath been ſo much denyed &amp; rejected by ſome here among us high in profeſſion, to the great admiration of many; and it it having pleaſed the Lord to raiſe up ſome to bear Witneſs to the Truth, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Unbelief of others, hath cauſed this Breach and Seperation, which ceaſing not there, nor in belying and falſly accuſing the Innocent, but ſeveral of the Oppoſers of the true Faith are entered into a Spirit of Perſecution, to the Impriſoning, Fining, and Taking away ſome of our Goods, and that ſo illegally as ſcarcely to be paralelled, as in time may be made appear, and therefore ſhall ſay no more of that at preſent, but come to the matter, wnich I am more particularly concerned to ſpeak to, and detect ſome of the greſs Lyes and falſe Reports that are ſpread abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:101146:2"/>Whereas ſince I publiſhed my Anſwer to the two Papers that came from Maryland, there is another Lying ſtory reported here, viz. <hi>That when I was in</hi> England <hi>with</hi> G F. <hi>he informed me that it was revealed to him that an eminent Star ſhould fall in</hi> America, <hi>and that he ſhould deſire me to ſignifie the ſame to Friends here; and that this Star was</hi> George Keith, <hi>who ſhould bring in Damnable Doctrines among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I poſitively deny that ever I ſo ſaid, or that <hi>G. F.</hi> did ever inform me any ſuch thing that a ſtar ſhould fall, or deſire me to ſignifie to Friends that this Star (<hi>viz. G K.</hi>) ſhould bring in damnable Doctrines among us, but on the contrary do ſay, that I believo <hi>G. F. W. P. G. W. R. B.</hi> and other faithful Friends had dear Unity with <hi>G. K.</hi> and his preſent Chriſtian Principles and Doctrines, though I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that my ſelf partly, and many others who have made a large Profeſſion of the Principles of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> did ſhew our diſlike to divers Principles of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine</hi> held forth by <hi>G. K.</hi> in ſome of his printed Books, and preached by him in our publick Meetings. But that I <hi>ſhould write to</hi> G. F. <hi>against</hi> G. K. <hi>ſhewing my diſlike to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Principles,</hi> is utterly falſe; for I never writ to <hi>G. F.</hi> or any other Perſon either in <hi>England</hi> or elſe-where, in diſlike of <hi>G. K</hi>'s Principles or Doctrine; but finding ſome perſons ſhew great diſlike of ſome of them, ſent <hi>G. F.</hi> one of <hi>G K</hi>'s Catechiſms, concluding that if there was any unſound Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſet forth therein, G.F. and Friends in <hi>England</hi> would ſignifie the ſame to Friends here, which yet they have not done, but on the contrary ſo far as they have had knowledge of the ſaid Difference have juſtified his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Now the moſt principal matters wherein I found ſome to differ with <hi>G. K.</hi> and wherein our Oppoſers ſtill differ with us, calling them <hi>Notions, &amp;c.</hi> but we on the contrary affirm them to be Goſpel-Truths, are as follweth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101146:2"/>1. <hi>That it is abſolutely neceſſary to our Salvation, and to make us true Chriſtians, to believe that Christ dyed for our ſins, &amp; roſe from the dead, and that he aſcended into Heaven without us, and is in Heaven making Interceſſion to the Father for us, as well as to believe in the Light within.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That Chriſt roſe from the dead, and aſcended into Heaven, and is now in Heaven glorified in the intire and perfect Nature of Man, in Soul and Body, appearing in the Preſence of God for us, our Advocate with the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Body, both of the Juſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, the Juſt unto Everlaſting Life, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt unto Shame and Torment forever; and that the Reſurrection of the Body is not received in this mortal Life, nor immediately after Death, but the deceaſed Saints generally wait for it, until the Coming of Christ; and that the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt, when the Body that is ſown Natural ſhall be raiſed Spiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That there is a general Day of Judgment yet to come, where<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> all Nations ſhall ſtand before the Son of Man, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus, at his Appearance and Coming without us, (as well as at his Appearance and Judgment Seat within us) to receive accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Deeds done in the Body, good or evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I being newly come from <hi>England,</hi> and there being ſome Books publiſhed by G. K. by the conſent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Friends here, ſome came to me, and ſhewed their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction with ſeveral things in the ſaid Books, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with the above cited Doctrines, which indeed I did partly queſtion the Truth of my ſelf, and having occaſion to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101146:3"/>
go into <hi>Maryland,</hi> did diſcourſe with ſome concerning the ſaid Principles, and found that ſome there did (as well as our preſent Oppoſers) account <hi>Carnal</hi> and <hi>dangerous Doctrines</hi>; and thereupon did caution them to beware of the ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which would ſhortly break forth among us. But will it therefore follow that the ſaid Doctrines are falſe? Not at all. And I can do no leſs than acknowledge my raſhneſs in cautioning others to beware of what I did not rigthly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand my ſelf, but too much taking on Truſt from others. But when I came to have more opportunity to hear G. K. my ſelf, and converſe with him, &amp; finding ſeveral honeſt Friends to agree with him in thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Principles</hi> and <hi>Doctrines,</hi> it put me upon the ſearch and enquiry, whether theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were according to the holy Scriptures, with Prayer to the Lord to guide me aright therein. And after ſome time, it pleaſed the Lord further to enlighten my Underſtanding and to confirm my Faith in thoſe things wherein before I was wavering and doubtful, and ready to be perſwaded that they were <hi>Carnal Notions</hi>; which now, bleſſed be the Lord, I believe to be <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> and therefore can do no leſs than joyn with and own G. K. in his preſent Chriſtian Teſtimony, and hope ſhall ſeal to the Truth thereof with my Blood, if called thereunto. And as I am ſorry to find ſome continue in their former Ignorance and Unbelief of thoſe precious Truths, ſo I am as ſorry and much more offended at the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie of others who in publick ſeem to own the Faith of Chriſt, thereby deceiving many ſimple hearted People, when yet it can be proved, by this two fold Inſtance, that they have not the true Faith, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> In that they have never ſignified their Repentance of their former declared Unbelief; and 2<hi>dly.</hi> In that they continue in Unity with them who have openly denyed the Lord that bought them; and though others of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101146:3"/>
them in publick ſay they own theſe <hi>Christian Doctrines,</hi> and know none that deny them, ſatisfies not us, while the ſame men oppoſe theſe very Doctrines upon all occaſions in private conferences; And if they had the true and right Faith, why ſhould they be ſo unwilling to give their offended Brethren an account thereof, when we have for ſo long a time deſired it, either by way of Conference, Writing or Print. But they have ſtill denyed to give us any account, but only in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture words, when ſome of them have expreſſed their Belief of certain Principles expreſly contrary to the Dictates of the Spirit of Truth in the holy Scriptures. We have given an Account of out faith, in the moſt neceſſary things of the Chriſtian Faith, in a Sheet added to the latter end of the Book entituled, <hi>Some Cauſes of the late Seperation, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, whereas it is frequently reported by <hi>John Wilsford, Arthur Cook,</hi> and others who are prejudiced againſt me, that I ſhould ſay, <hi>That I did weep ſo much in a Meeting as to wet two Handkercheifs of three Quarters of a yard each, and all in deceit.</hi> To which I ſay, this is a great Lye, raiſed againſt me on purpoſe to defame me, and to leſſen Peoples love towards me and my Chriſtian Teſtimony. But ſuppoſe I did ſignifie to ſome of my tenderneſs, and frequent weeping in Meetings, when I was a Boy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> that in thoſe days I was often tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Meetings, inſomuch that at one Meeting I did weep ſo much as to wet my Handkercheif, but I cannot ſay nor never did ſay, that this was all in deceit; and therefore the ſaid Report is a Lye, and I do place it on the Authors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters thereof, let them clear themſelves if they can.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas it is further reported by <hi>Arthur Cook, That I ſtruck him on the face in the publick Meeting in</hi> Philadelphia
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101146:4"/>
               <hi>the</hi> 20<hi>th of the</hi> 9<hi>th Month laſt</hi>; and this Report being ſpread abroad to my Prejudice and Defamation. This is to ſignifie to all who are deſirous to know the Truth of the matter, and love not to believe Lyes, that the thing is utterly falſe, and without all ground; but he hath raiſed it from this, that the ſaid <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> having the firſt day before (being the 13 of the 9 mon.) ſtood cloſe by <hi>G. K.</hi> while he was declaring, and ſtaring him in the face, intending thereby to diſquiet him, often ſaying, <hi>Deceit, Deceit, and who can bear this?</hi> that many that obſerved it, thought very uncivil and rude; and the next firſt day <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> intending to do the like again while G. K. was declaring, I ſtept in betwixt G.K. and him, to keep him off, from ſtaring him in the face, but <hi>Arthur</hi> preſſing to get cloſe to G. K. I ſtood in his way, and <hi>Arthur</hi> ſaid, <hi>Wilt thou puſh me? No,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>but I think to ſtand in the way, and not let thee come cloſe to him,</hi> and withal, in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar way, I did gently ſtroke his face, as a Nurſe would do a ſuching Child, and as one will do to another that is familiar to him, intending no hurt, nor doing no hurt in the leaſt, more than a Nurſe will do to a Child; and my Principles have ſufficiently been known to be Chriſtian and Peaceable, againſt all Violence and Striking, and my Practice hath been known to be correſponding; and becauſe of my peaceable Inclination, I have refuſed for ſome years paſt to be any wiſe concerned in Government, and ſerving upon Juries, for which I am now under a Fine. And therefore that Suggeſtion and Report concerning my ſtriking <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> is a meer Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and falſe Accuſation.</p>
