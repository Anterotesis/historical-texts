            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Friendly Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving often observed, upon serious Discourse with divers Persons, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Principles, their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received general satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, excepting in these Two Heads, <hi>viz. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and not knowing but that thou may be at a stand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the same, I do here
<pb facs="tcp:64310:3"/>
present thee for thy further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and satisfaction these following Sheets, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and published several Years ago, upon the same Subjects, by my Father <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barclay,</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> Dedicated to King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>The second and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reason of their being thus published by themselves, is, that being Bound up in a pretty large Book, they may not be of such general Service, in regard that some dissatisfied only concerning these Two Points, may not much care to Buy the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64310:3"/>
Being fully satisfied his aim in Penning them, was for thy satisfaction, I shall commend them no otherways, than by recommending them to thy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perusal, not doubting if they be by thee received in the same <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> they were for thy sake designed, they may prove advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>I do likewise advise thee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to consider, what wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful consequence have been procured in the <hi>Titular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian World,</hi> since the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy after the Apostles Days, about these things, and
<pb facs="tcp:64310:4"/>
the setting up of Forms and Ceremonies in the <hi>Church</hi> in Matters purely <hi>Religious,</hi> and relying thereupon, as there are too many in these Days do, who by grasping at the shadow do lose the substance. I pray God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Eyes, and enlighten the Understandings of such, that seeing the emptiness and insufficiency, as well as folly thereof, they may with their whole <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> lay hold upon him who is able to save, and that to the <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64310:4"/>
I would have none offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I call those Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which they may think Essential Duties, without their being first assured they are such.</p>
            <p>Although I refer thee to the following Sheets for thy more particular Information, yet it may not seem imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to put thee in mind of that saying of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> concerning himself, <hi>I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed baptize you with Water unto Repentance, but he that cometh after me, is mightier than I, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:64310:5"/>
               <hi>Fire, Mat.</hi> 3. 11. also <hi>HE must Increase but</hi> I <hi>must De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, John</hi> 3. 30. likewise that of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> where he notably argues, as there is but <hi>one Lord, one Faith,</hi> so there is but <hi>one Baptism, Eph.</hi> 4. 5. which the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> positively asserts <hi>is not the washing away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience towards God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. These I leave without Commentary, to thy impartial perusal.</p>
            <p>It were greatly to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, that we who covet to be called by that Honourable
<pb facs="tcp:64310:5"/>
Name of <hi>Christian,</hi> were more inward, less in show, more in <hi>Substance,</hi> that our <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> were more in our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and less in our Heads; then would our <hi>Religion</hi> be pure and undefiled, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with it that Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteristick mark, of <hi>visiting</hi> the <hi>Widow</hi> and the <hi>Fatherless,</hi> and keeping our selves <hi>unspotted</hi> from the World; this is the Description the <hi>Apostle James</hi> in his Day gave of True <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, James</hi> 1. 27. this is likewise the Path the True <hi>Christian</hi> ought now to walk in, it being only as we here
<pb facs="tcp:64310:6"/>
abide, that we can stand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, in the sight of our Great <hi>Creator,</hi> in which, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as thou art found a Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with a single Heart and Eye unto God, thou wilt know an eating of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and drinking of the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Son of God, by which thou vvilt knovv <hi>Life,</hi> unto thy <hi>Soul,</hi> according to that saying of our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jesus Christ, Except ye eat the Flesh, and drink the Blood of the Son of Man, there is no Life in you;</hi> for saith he, <hi>my Flesh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed,</hi>

since, as our <hi>Adversaries</hi> will not deny, <hi>Water-baptism</hi> doth not always imply it, neither is it any necessary Consequence thereof.

               <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer, as to that, <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi> was unto <hi>Repentance,</hi> the <hi>Difference</hi> lieth not there, because so is <hi>Christ's</hi> also. For our <hi>Adversaries</hi> will not deny, but that <hi>Adult Persons,</hi> that are <hi>baptized,</hi> ought, ere they be admitted to it, to <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Confess</hi> their Sins; yea, and that <hi>Infants</hi> with a respect to, and Consideration of their <hi>Baptism,</hi> ought to <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Confess:</hi> So that the <hi>difference</hi> lieth not here; since this of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Confession</hi> agrees as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64310:26"/>
well to <hi>Christ's,</hi> as to <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptism.</hi> But in this our <hi>Adversaries</hi> are divided: for <hi>Calvin</hi> will have <hi>Christ</hi>'s and <hi>John</hi>'s to be all one; <hi>Inst. lib.</hi> 4. cap. 15. Sect. 7, 8. Yet they do <hi>differ,</hi> and the <hi>difference</hi> is, in that the one is by <hi>Water,</hi> the other not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly:</hi> As to what Christ saith, in commanding them to <hi>baptize in the Name of the Father, Son and Spirit,</hi> I confess that states the <hi>Difference,</hi> and it is great; but that lies not only in admitting <hi>Water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> in this different Form, by a bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of these Words: For as the <hi>Text</hi> saith no such thing, neither do I see, how it can be inferred from it. For the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> how taken in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </note> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>into the Name;</hi> now the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> is often taken in Scripture for something else, than a bare sound of Words, or <hi>literal Expression,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for his <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from <hi>Psalm</hi> 54. 3. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 10. and in many more. Now, that the Apostles were by their <hi>Ministry</hi> to <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi> the <hi>Nations into this Name, Vertue</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and that they did so, is evident, by these <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, where he saith, That <hi>as many of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism into the Name</hi> what it is?</note> 
               <hi>them, as were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ:</hi> This must have been a <hi>baptizing</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:64310:26"/>
               <hi>into the Name,</hi> i. e. <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and not a meer formal Expression of Words adjoined with <hi>Water-baptism;</hi> because, as hath been above observed, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as a <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>necessary Consequence</hi> of it. I would have those, who desire to have their <hi>Faith</hi> built upon no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, than the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>God's Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> throughly to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether there can be any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alledged for this <hi>Interpretation,</hi> than what the prejudice of <hi>Education</hi> and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Tradition</hi> hath imposed: Perhaps it may stumble the unwary and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Reader,</hi> as if the very <hi>Character</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> were abolished, to tell him plainly, that this <hi>Scripture</hi> is not to be understood of <hi>baptizing</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> and that this form of <hi>baptizing</hi> in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> hath no warrant from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For which, besides the Reason taken <note place="margin">Whether <hi>Christ</hi> did prescribe a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.</note> from the <hi>Signification</hi> of <hi>[the Name]</hi> as being the <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> above expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, let it be considered, that, if that had been a <hi>Form prescribed</hi> by Christ to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, then surely, they would have made use of that <hi>Form</hi> in the administring of <hi>Water-baptism</hi> to such as they <hi>baptized</hi> with <hi>Water;</hi> but though particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

And therefore it is safer to conclude, that what they did in administring <hi>Water-baptism,</hi> they did not by vertue of that <hi>Commission;</hi> else they would have so used it: For our <hi>Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> I suppose, would judge it a great <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi> to Administer <hi>Water-baptism</hi> without that, or only in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Jesus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mention of <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said they did, in the two places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited.</p>

            <p>Now for their calling them <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Manichees,</hi> we have nothing but the Testimony of their Accusers; which will no more invalidate their Testimony for this <hi>Truth</hi> against the use of <hi>Water-baptism,</hi> or give more ground to charge us, as being one with <hi>Manichees,</hi> than because some, called by them <hi>Manichees,</hi> do agree with <hi>Protestants</hi> in some things, that therefore <hi>Protestants</hi> are <hi>Manichees</hi> or <hi>Hereticks:</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:64310:35"/>
which <hi>Protestants</hi> can no ways shun.

               </note> the <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Infant-baptism,</hi> it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows, from what is above-said.

For he that proves <hi>Water-baptism</hi> Ceased, proves, that <hi>Infant-baptism</hi> is Vain: But he that should prove, that <hi>Water-baptism</hi> continues, has not thence proved, that <hi>Infant-baptism</hi> is necessary; That needs something fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

            <p>§ I. THE Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ, is a Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hid from all natural men in their first,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64310:36"/>
fall'n and degenerate State; which they cannot understand, reach to, nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, as they there abide, neither as they there are, can they be Partakers of it, nor yet are they able to Discern the Lord's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And forasmuch as the Christian World (so called) for the most part hath been still labouring, working, conceiving and imagining in their own natural and unrenewed Understandings about the things of God and Religion, therefore hath this Mystery much been hid and sealed up from them, while they have been conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, quarrelling and fighting one with another about the meer Shadow, Outside and Form, but strangers to the Substance, Life and Vertue.</p>
            <p>§ II. The Body then of Christ, which <note place="margin">The <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
               </note> Believers partake of, is Spiritual, and not Carnal; and his Blood, which they drink of, is pure and Heavenly, and not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane or Elementary; as <hi>Augustin</hi> also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms of the Body of Christ, which is Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, in his <hi>Tractat,</hi> Psal. 98. <hi>Except a Man eat my Flesh, he hath not in him Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal:</hi> And he saith; <q>The Words, which I speak unto you, are Spirit and Life, understand spiritually what I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Ye shall not eat of this Body, which ye see, and drink this Blood,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64310:36"/>
which they shall spill, that Crucifie me: <hi>I am the Living Bread, which have descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Heaven;</hi> he called himself the Bread, who descended from Heaven, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting that we might believe in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Quest. If it be asked then, What that Body, What that Flesh and Blood is?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer: It is that Heavenly Seed, that Divine, Spiritual, Coelestial Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, of which we spake before in the 5th and 6th Propositions. This is that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiculum Dei,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">What the <hi>heavenly Seed</hi> is, whereby formerly and also now <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was and is <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</hi>
               </note> or Spiritual Body of Christ, whereby and where-through he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth Life to Men, and <hi>Salvation to as many as believe in him,</hi> and <hi>receive him;</hi> and whereby also Man comes to have Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship and Communion with God. This is proved from the 6th of <hi>John,</hi> from <hi>verse</hi> 32. to the end, where Christ speaks more at large of this matter, than in any other place: And indeed, this Evangelist and beloved Disciple, who lay in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of our Lord, gives us a more full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Spiritual Sayings and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ: And it's observable, that though he speaks nothing of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny used by Christ, of Breaking Bread with his Disciples, neither in his Evangelical Account of Christ's Life and Sufferings,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64310:37"/>
nor in his Epistles; yet he is more large in this account of the Participation of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Flesh and Blood of Christ, than any of them all. For Christ in this Chapter perceiving, that the <hi>Jews</hi> did follow him for Love of the Loaves, desires them <hi>(ver.</hi> 27.) to <hi>labour not for the Meat which peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,</hi> but <hi>for that Meat which endureth for ever:</hi> But forasmuch as they, being Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in their Apprehensions, and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Spiritual Language and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ, did judge the <hi>Manna,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> gave their Fathers, to be the most Excellent Bread, as coming from Heaven; Christ, to rectifie that mistake, and better inform them, affirmeth <hi>First,</hi> That it is not <hi>Moses, but his Father, that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>Body, Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>

               <hi>giveth the true Bread from Heaven,</hi> ver. 32. and 48. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Bread he calls himself, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. <hi>I am the Bread of Life:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 51. <hi>I am the living Bread, which came down from Heaven: Thirdly,</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that this Bread is his Flesh, <hi>ver.</hi> 51. <hi>The Bread, that I will give, is my Flesh:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 55. <hi>For my Flesh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is drink indeed: Fourthly,</hi> The Necessity of Partaking thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 53. <hi>Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no Life in you:</hi> And lastly, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. the blessed Fruits and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

Effects of this Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ; <hi>This Bread gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Life to the World,</hi> ver. 50. <hi>He that eateth thereof dyeth not;</hi> ver. 58. <hi>He, that eateth of this Bread, shall live for ever,</hi> ver. 51. <hi>Whose eateth this Flesh, and drinketh this Blood, shall live for ever,</hi> ver. 54. <hi>And he dwelleth in Christ, and Christ in him;</hi> ver. 56. <hi>And shall live by Christ;</hi> ver. 57. From this large Description of the <hi>Origine,</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Effects of this Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ, it is apparent, that it is Spiritual, and to be understood of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body, and not of that Body or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Jesus Christ, which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and in which he walked, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and suffered in the Land of <hi>Judea;</hi> because that it is said, both that it <hi>came down from Heaven,</hi> yea, that it is <hi>He, that came down from Heaven.</hi> Now all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at present generally acknowledge, that the outward Body of Christ came not down from Heaven, neither was it that part of Christ, which <hi>came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And to put the matter out of doubt, when the Carnal <hi>Jews</hi> would have been so understanding it, he tells them plainly, <hi>ver.</hi> 63. <hi>It is the Spirit, that quickeneth, but the Flesh profiteth nothing.</hi> This is also founded upon most sound and solid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64310:38"/>
because that it is the Soul, not the <note place="margin">Solid <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> that it is Ilis <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body,</hi> Christ speaks of.</note> Body, that is to be nourished by this Flesh and Blood. Now outward Flesh cannot nourish nor feed the Soul; there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, nor Analogy betwixt them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Communion of the Saints with God by a Conjunction and mutual Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Flesh, but of the Spirit: <hi>He that</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> 
               <hi>is joined to the Lord, is One Spirit,</hi> not one Flesh. For the Flesh (I mean outward Flesh, even such as was that, wherein Christ lived and walked, when upon Earth; and not Flesh, when transposed by a Metaphor, to be understood Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) can only partake of Flesh, as Spirit of Spirit: As the Body cannot feed upon Spirit, neither can the Spirit feed upon Flesh. And that the Flesh here spoken of, is spiritually understood, appears further, in that, that which feedeth upon it, shall never dye: But the Bodies of all Men once dye, yea it behoved the Body of Christ himself to dye. That this Body and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Flesh and Blood of Christ is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of that Divine and Heavenly Seed before spoken of by us, appears both by the Nature and Fruits of it. <hi>First,</hi> It's said, <hi>It is that, which cometh down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and giveth Life unto the World:</hi> Now, this answers to that Light and Seed, which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64310:38"/>
is testified of, <hi>John</hi> 1. to be the Light of the World, and the Life of Men. For that Spiritual Light and Seed, as it receives <note place="margin">The <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Light</hi> and <hi>Seed</hi> is as <hi>Bread</hi> to the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Soul.</hi>
               </note> place in mens Hearts, and room to spring up there, is as Bread to the hungry and fainting Soul, that is (as it were) buried and dead in the lusts of the World, which receives Life again; and revives, as it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth and partaketh of this heavenly Bread: And they that partake of it, are said to come to Christ; neither can any have it, but by coming to him, and believing in the appearance of his Light in their Hearts; by receiving which, and believing in it, the Participation of this Body and Bread is known. And that Christ understands the same thing here by his Body, Flesh and Blood, which is understood <hi>John</hi> 1. by the Light inlightening every Man, and the Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> appears, for the Light and Life spoken of <hi>John</hi> 1. is said to be Christ; <hi>He is the true Light:</hi> and the Bread and Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> spoken of in this 6th of <hi>John,</hi> is called Christ; <hi>I am the Bread of Life,</hi> saith he. Again, <hi>They that received that Light and Life,</hi> John 1. 12. <hi>Obtained Power to become the Sons of God, by believing in his Name:</hi> So also here, <hi>John</hi> 6. 35. <hi>He that cometh unto this Bread of Life shall not Hunger; and he that believes in him, who</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:64310:39"/>
               <hi>is this Bread shall never thirst.</hi> So then, as there was the outward visible Body and <note place="margin">Christ's <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body</hi> distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</note> Temple of Jesus Christ, which took its Original from the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> so there is also the Spiritual Body of Christ, by and through which He, that was the Word in the beginning with God, and was and is GOD, did Reveal himself to the Sons of Men in all Ages, and whereby Men in all Ages come to be made partakers of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, and to have Communion and Fellowship with God and Christ. Of which Body of Christ, and Flesh and Blood, if both <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> did eat of the <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ.</note> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and all the Prophets and Holy Men of God had not eaten, they had not had Life in them, nor could their inward Man have been nourished. Now, as the outward Body and Temple was called Christ, so was also this Spiritual Body no less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and that long before that outward Body was in Being. Hence the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3, 4. That the <hi>Fathers did all eat the same spiritual Meat, and did all drink the same spiritual. Drink: (for they drank of that Spiritual Rock, that followed them; and that Rock was Christ.)</hi> This cannot be understood otherwise than of this Spiritual Body of Christ: Which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

For as Jesus Christ, in obedience to the Will of the Father, did by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Spirit offer up that Body for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the Remission of Sins, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his Testimony upon Earth thereby, in a most perfect Example of Patience, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation and Holiness, that all might be

For as without Outward Food the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body hath not Life; so also saith Christ, <hi>Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and</hi>

               <hi>Blood</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>dwelleth in me, and I in him;</hi> this cannot be understood of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Eating of Outward Bread: And as by this the Soul must have Fellowship with God, so also in so far as all the Saints are Partakers of this One Body, and this One Blood, they come also to have a Joint-Communion. Hence the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. in this respect saith, That they <hi>being many, are One Bread, and One Body:</hi> And to the Wise among the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> he saith, <hi>The Bread, which we break,</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64310:42"/>
the Light of the Lord, and feels and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of that Heavenly Life, by which the Inward Man is nourished: Which may be, and is often witnessed by the Faithful at all times; though more particularly, when they are Assembled together to Wait upon the Lord.</p>
            <p>§ IV. But what Confusion the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of Christianity have run into concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this matter, is more than obvious; who (as in most other things they have done) for want of a true Spiritual Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, have sought to Tie this Supper of the Lord to that Ceremony (used by <note place="margin">Man is not tied to the <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>breaking Bread</hi> and <hi>drinking Wine,</hi> which Christ did use with his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; This only was a <hi>Shadow.</hi>
               </note> Christ before his Death) of breaking Bread and drinking Wine with his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And though they for the most part agree in this general, yet how do they Contend and Debate one against another? How strangely are they pinched, pained, and straitned to make this Spiritual My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery agree to that Ceremony? And what monstrous and wild Opinions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings have they invented, to inclose or affix the Body of Christ to their Bread and Wine? From which Opinion not only the greatest, and fiercest, and most hurtful Contests, both among the Professors of Christianity in general, and among Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants in particular, have arisen; but also
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64310:42"/>
such Absurdities, irrational and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <note place="margin">What makes the <hi>Christian Religion hateful</hi> to <hi>Jews, Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens?</hi>
               </note> Consequences have ensued, as make the Christian Religion odious and hateful to <hi>Jews, Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christianity do chiefly divide in this matter into three Opinions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> is of those that say, <hi>The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists Faith</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> his <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>of the Bread is</hi> Transubstantiated <hi>into the very Substance of that same Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ, which was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and crucified by the</hi> Jews: So that after the Words of Consecration (as they call them) <hi>it is no more Bread, but the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> is of such as say; <hi>The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> Faith.</note> 
               <hi>of the Bread remains; but that also that Body is</hi> in, <hi>and</hi> with, <hi>and</hi> under <hi>the Bread.</hi> So that <hi>both the Substance of the Bread, and the Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ, is there also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> is of those, that (denying <note place="margin">The <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists</hi> Faith.</note> both these) do affirm, <hi>That the Body of Christ is not there Corporally, or Substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but yet that it is Really and Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received by the Faithful, in the use of Bread and Wine:</hi> But how, or what way it's there, <hi>they know not, nor can they tell; only we must believe it is there, yet so, that it is only properly in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not my Design to enter into a Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64310:43"/>
of these several Opinions, for each of their Authors and Assertors have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently Refuted one another; and are all of them no less strong both from Scripture and Reason, in Refuting each their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Party's Opinion, than they are Weak in Establishing their own. For I often have seriously observed in reading their respective Writings (and so it may be have others) that all of them do notably, in so far as they Refute the contrary Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but that they are mightily pained, when they come to Confirm and Plead for their own: Hence I necessarily must conclude, That none of them had attained to the Truth and Substance of this Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Let us see, if <hi>Calvin,</hi> after he hath <note place="margin">Inst. lib. 4. <hi>cap</hi> 17.</note> Refuted the two former Opinions, be more successful, in what he affirms and asserts for the Truth of his Opinion; who, after he hath much laboured in overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Refuting the two former Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, plainly confesseth, that he <hi>knows not, what to affirm instead of them.</hi> For after he has spoken much, and at last Concluded, <hi>That the Body of Christ is there, and that the Saints must needs partake thereof;</hi> at last he <note place="margin">
                  <hi>J. Calvin</hi>'s Faith of Christ his <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</note> lands in these Words. <hi>(Sect.</hi> 32.) <hi>But if it be asked me, how it is? I shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to confess, That it is a Secret, too high</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:64310:43"/>
               <hi>for me to comprehend in my Spirit, or explain in Words.</hi> Here he deals very ingenious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and yet who would have thought, that such a Man would have been brought to this Strait in the Confirming of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? Considering but a little before, in the same Chapter <hi>(Sect.</hi> 15.) he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Schoolmen among the <hi>Papists,</hi> (and I Confess truly) <hi>In that they neither</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The like the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Understand, nor Explain to others, how Christ is in the Eucharist;</hi> which shortly after he Confesseth himself, he cannot do. If then the School-men among the <hi>Papists</hi> do neither Understand, nor yet can Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to others their Doctrine in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor <hi>Calvin</hi> can comprehend it in his Spirit, (which I judge is as much, as not to understand it) nor Express it in Words (and then surely he cannot Explain it to others) then no certainty is to be had from either of them. There have been great Endeavours used for Reconcilement in this matter, both betwixt <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> yea, and <hi>Calvinists</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> but all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: and many Forms and Manners of Expressions drawn up, to which all might yield; which in the end proved in vain, seeing every one understood them, and interpreted them, their own way: and so
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64310:44"/>
they did thereby but Equivocate and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive one another. The Reason of all this Contention is, because they all wanted a clear Understanding of the Mystery, and were doting about the Shadow and the Externals. For both the Ground and Matter of their Contest lies in things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick from, and unnecessary to the main Matter; and this hath been often the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of Satan to busie People, and amuse <note place="margin">

               </note> them with outward Signs, Shadows and Forms, making them Contend about that; while in the mean time the Substance is neglected. Yea, and in Contending for these Shadows, he stirs them up to the practice of Malice, Heat, Revenge and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vices, by which he establisheth his Kingdom of Darkness among them, and ruines the Life of Christianity: For there has been more Animosity and Heat about this one Particular, and more Blood-shed and Contention, than about any other. And surely, they are little acquainted with the State of Protestants Affairs, who know not, that their Contentions about this <note place="margin">What hath been <hi>hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </note> have been more hurtful to the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than all the Opposition they met with from their common Adversaries. Now all these uncertain and absurd Opinions, and the Contentions therefrom arising, have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64310:44"/>
proceeded from their all agreeing in Two General Errors concerning this thing: Which being denied and receded from, as they are by us, there would be an Easie Way made for Reconciliation, and we should all meet in the one Spiritual and true Understanding of this Mystery; and as the Contentions, so would also the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, which follow from all the Three forementioned Opinions, Cease and fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> of these <hi>Errors</hi> is, in making <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Two Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> the ground of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Supper.</hi>
               </note> the Communion or Participation of the Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ to relate to that outward Body, Vessel or Temple, that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and walked and suffered in <hi>Judea;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it should relate to the Spiritual Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ, even that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and Celestial Light and Life, which was the Food and Nourishment of the Regenerate in all Ages, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Error</hi> is, In tying this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Body and Blood of Christ to that Ceremony, used by him with his Disciples in the breaking of bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if it had only a Relation thereto, or, were only enjoyed in the use of that Ceremony; which it neither hath, nor is. For this is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64310:45"/>
that Bread, which Christ in his Prayer teaches to call for, terming it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. the supersubstantial Bread, as the <hi>Greek</hi> hath it; and which the Soul partakes of, without any relation or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary respect to this Ceremony, as shall be hereafter proved more at length.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Two Errors</hi> being thus laid aside, and the Contentions arising therefrom bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, all are agreed in the main Positions, <hi>viz. First,</hi> That <hi>the body, flesh and blood of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Believers Souls</hi> do really <hi>feed</hi> upon the <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ.</note> 
               <hi>Christ is necessary for the nourishing of the Soul: Secondly,</hi> That <hi>the Souls of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do really and truly partake and feed upon the body, flesh and blood of Christ.</hi> But while Men are not content with the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality of this Mystery, going in their own Wills, and according to their own Inventions, to strain and wrest the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for to tie this Spiritual Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the flesh and blood of Christ, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bread and Wine, and such like Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances, no wonder, if by their carnal Apprehensions they run into Heaps and Confusion. But because it hath been generally supposed, that the Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ had some special relation to the Ceremony of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bread, I shall first Refute that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then proceed to consider the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:64310:45"/>
and <hi>Use</hi> of that <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be now <hi>necessary to Continue;</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the <hi>Reasons</hi> and <hi>Objections</hi> of such as plead its <hi>Continuance,</hi> as a necessary and standing <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

            <p>§ V.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 
               <hi>First,</hi> It must be understood, that  I speak of a <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Peculiar Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">That the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> has no <hi>special Relation</hi> to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>breaking Bread,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Nature,</hi> nor <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi>
               </note> otherwise than in a <hi>general Respect:</hi> For, forasmuch as our <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> is, and ought to be, our greatest and chiefest Work, we ought to do all other things with a <hi>Respect</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship</hi> with him; but a <hi>special</hi> and <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Respect</hi> or Relation is such, as where the two things are tied and united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either of their own <hi>Nature,</hi> or by the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that the one cannot be enjoyed, or at least is not (except ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extraordinarily) without the other.

Secondly,</hi> Their relation is not by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> else they would infer one another: but all acknowledge, that many <hi>eat</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> of the <hi>Wine,</hi> even that which, they say, is <hi>Consecrate</hi> and

which indeed is all one with his <hi>Blood</hi> here spoken of: Yet it will not follow, that that <hi>Well,</hi> or <hi>Water,</hi> had any necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">The <hi>Well,</hi> the <hi>Loaves</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> Christ takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from, to shew the <hi>Inward Feeding.</hi>

So also Christ here being at <hi>Supper</hi> with his <hi>Disoiples,</hi> takes occasion from the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> which was before them, to signifie unto them, that as <hi>That Bread,</hi> which he <hi>brake</hi> unto them, and <hi>That Wine,</hi> which he <hi>blessed</hi> and <hi>gave</hi> unto them, did contribute to the <hi>preserving</hi> and <hi>nourishing</hi> of their <hi>Bodies;</hi> so was he also to give his <hi>Body,</hi> and shed his <hi>Blood</hi> for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of their <hi>Souls:</hi> And therefore the very <hi>End</hi> proposed in <hi>this Ceremony,</hi> to those that observe it, is to be a <hi>Memorial</hi> of his <hi>Death.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I do most willingly subscribe unto it;

but do deny, that this is understood of the <hi>outward Bread,</hi> neither can it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, but the Contrary is manifest from the <hi>Context:</hi> For the Apostle in this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> speaks not one Word of that <hi>Ceremony.</hi> For having in the beginning of it shewn them, how the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Old</hi> were made <hi>partakers</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual Food</hi> and <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which was <hi>Christ,</hi> and how several of them, through <hi>Disobedience</hi> and <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> fell from that good Condition, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them by the <hi>Example</hi> of those <hi>Jews,</hi> whom God destroyed of Old, to <hi>flee</hi> those <hi>Evils;</hi> shewing them, that they (to wit, the <hi>Corinthians)</hi> are likewise <hi>parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> of the <hi>body and blood of Christ,</hi> of which <hi>Communion</hi> they would <hi>rob</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if they did <hi>Evil, because they could not drink of the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils, and partake of the Lord's Table, and of the Table of Devils,</hi> ver. 21.

            <p>These things being premised, let it be observed, that the very <hi>express</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Use</hi> of it, according to the Apostle is, <hi>To shew forth the Lord's Death,</hi> &amp;c. But <hi>to shew forth the Lord's Death,</hi> and

               <hi>partake of the flesh and blood of Christ,</hi> are different things: He saith not, <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye partake of the Body and Blood of Christ;</hi> but, <hi>Ye shew forth the Lord's Death.</hi> So I acknowledge, that <hi>this Ceremony,</hi> by those that practise it, hath an <hi>Immediate Relation</hi> to the <hi>outward Body</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> upon the <hi>Cross,</hi> as being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a <hi>Memorial</hi> of it; but it doth not thence follow, that it hath any <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>immediate Relation</hi> to <hi>Believers communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating</hi> or <hi>partaking</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> or that <hi>Spiritual Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> spoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20.

But yet, as he that <hi>Esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Day,</hi> and placed Conscience in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, was to regard it to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and so it was to him, in so far as he dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it unto the Lord, the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> he was to do it <hi>Worthily;</hi> and if he did it <hi>Unworthily,</hi> he would be <hi>guilty</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> and so keep it to his own <hi>Damnation:</hi> So also such as observe <hi>this Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> it is to them the <hi>Bread</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> because they <hi>Use</hi> it as a <hi>Religious Act:</hi> And forasmuch as their <hi>End</hi> therein is, <hi>To shew forth the Lord's Death,</hi> and to <hi>Remember his Body,</hi> that was <hi>Crucified</hi> for them, and his <hi>Blood,</hi> that was <hi>shed</hi> for them; If notwithstanding they believe it is their <hi>Duty</hi> to do it, and make it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Conscience</hi> to <hi>forbear,</hi> if they do it without that due <hi>Preparation</hi> and <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>

               <hi>Grace, by which all the Benefits of Christ's Death are sealed to Believers,</hi> and such like things? But to give a further Evidence, how these <hi>Consequences</hi> have not any bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom from the <hi>Practice</hi> of that <hi>Ceremony,</hi> nor from the words following, <hi>Do this,</hi> &amp;c. let us consider another of the like Nature, as it is at length expressed by <hi>John,</hi> c. 13. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 8, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Jesus riseth from Supper, and laid aside his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and took a Towel, and girded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: After that he poured Water into a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and began to Wash the Disciples Feet, and to wipe them with the Towel, wherewith he was girded. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never Wash my Feet: Jesus answered him, If I Wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. So after he had Washed their</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Christ's <hi>Washing</hi> of <hi>Feet,</hi> and its <hi>Manner</hi> related.</note> 
               <hi>Feet, he said, Know ye, what I have done to you? If I then your Lord and Master have Washed your Feet, ye also ought to Wash one anothers Feet: For I have given you an</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>that ye should do, as I have done to you.</hi> As to which let it be observed, that <hi>John</hi> relates this Passage to have been done at the same time, with the other of <hi>breaking Bread,</hi> both being done the <hi>Night</hi> of the <hi>Pass-over,</hi> after <hi>Supper.</hi> If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Narration</hi> of this, and the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> attending it, it was done with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64310:53"/>
far more <hi>Solemnity,</hi> and prescribed far more punctually and particularly, than the <hi>former.</hi> It is said only, <hi>As he was Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Compar'd with the <hi>Breaking</hi> of <hi>Bread.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>he took Bread;</hi> so that this would seem to be but an <hi>Occasional business:</hi> But here <hi>he rose up, he laid by his Garments, he gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself, he poured out the Water, he</hi> Washed <hi>their</hi> Feet, <hi>he wiped them with the Towel; He did this to all of them:</hi> Which are <hi>Circumstances</hi> surely far more observable, than those noted in the other. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was a Practice common among the <hi>Jews,</hi> used by all Masters of Families up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that occasion; but this, as to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Person acting it, to wit, for the Master to rise up, and Wash the Feet of his Servants and Disciples, was more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and observable. In the breaking of Bread, and giving of Wine, it is not plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> nor yet mentioned in the Text, that he particularly put them into the hands of all; but breaking it, and blessing it, gave it the nearest, and so they from hand to hand: But here it is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, that he Washed not the Feet of one or two, but of many. He saith not in the former, that if they do not eat of that Bread; and drink of that Wine, they shall be prejudiced by it; but here he saith expresly to <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>if he Wash</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:64310:54"/>
               <hi>not him, he hath no part with him:</hi> Which being spoken upon <hi>Peter</hi>'s Refusing to let him Wash his Feet, would seem to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port no less, than not the Continuance only, but even the Necessity of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. In the former he saith, as it were passingly, <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me;</hi> but here he sitteth down: Again, he desires them to consider what he hath done; tells them positively, <hi>that as he hath done</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers Feet</hi> was left, as an <hi>Example.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>to them, so ought they to do to one another:</hi> And yet again, he redoubles that Precept, by telling them, <hi>he has given them an</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>that they should do so likewise.</hi> If we respect the Nature of the thing, it hath as much in it, as either Baptism or the breaking of Bread, seeing it is an outward Element of a cleansing Nature, applied to the outward Man, by the Command and the Example of Christ, to signifie an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward purifying. I would willingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this seriously to Men that will be pleased to make use of that Reason and Understanding that God hath given them, and not be imposed upon, nor abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Custom or Tradition of others, Whether this Ceremony, if we respect either the Time, that it was Appointed in, or the Circumstances, wherewith it was performed or the Command enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the use of it, hath not as much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it for a standing Ordinance of the Gospel, as either Water-Baptism, or Bread and Wine, or any other of that kind? I wonder then what Reason the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> can give, why they have not numbred it among their <hi>Sacraments,</hi> except meerly <hi>Voluntas Ecclesiae &amp; Traditio Patrum.</hi>

And this proceeds, because they take it not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it lies in the Scripture; but have
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64310:58"/>
so much mixed in their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>For would they take it as it lies, it would import no more, than that <hi>Jesus Christ at that time did thereby signifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that his Body and Blood was to be offered for them;</hi> and desired them, that <hi>whensoever they did eat or drink, they might do it in Remembrance of him, or with a Regard to him, whose Blood was shed for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered immediately after his Ascension, did so understand it, doth appear from their Use and Practice, if we admit those places in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where <hi>breaking of Bread</hi> is spoken of, to have relation hereto; which as our Adversaries do, so we shall willingly agree to. As first, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. <hi>And they continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine, and Fellowship, and in Breaking of Bread,</hi> &amp;c. This cannot be understood of any other than of their <hi>Ordinary Eating;</hi> for as nothing else appears from the <hi>Text,</hi> so the <hi>Context</hi> makes it plain; for they <note place="margin">
                  <hi>By Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread</hi> they had <hi>all things</hi> in <hi>comman; Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring</hi> the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>had all things in common;</hi> and therefore it is said, Ver. 26. <hi>And they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and</hi> Breaking of Bread <hi>from House to House, did eat their</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:64310:58"/>
               <hi>Meat with gladness, and singleness of heart.</hi> Who will not wilfully close their Eyes, may see here, that their <hi>Breaking</hi> being joyned with their <hi>Eating,</hi> shews, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else is here expressed, but that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things in common, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing together, they also did <hi>Break their Bread,</hi> and <hi>Eat</hi> their <hi>Meat together:</hi> In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof I shall not doubt but they <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the Lord,</hi> to follow whom they had with so great <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Resignation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken themselves. This is further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest from <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 26. For the Apostles ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Distribution</hi> of that <hi>Money,</hi> which the Believers having sold their Possessions gave unto them, finding themselves over-charged with that Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, appointed Deacons for that business, that they might give themselves continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and to the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deacons</hi> appointed <hi>for serving</hi> at <hi>Tables.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Word;</hi> not leaving that, to <hi>serve Tables.</hi> This cannot be meant of any Sacramental Eating, or Religious Act of Worship; seeing our Adversaries make the <hi>distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of that, the proper Act of <hi>Ministers,</hi> not of <hi>Deacons:</hi> And yet there can be no Reason alledged, that that <hi>Breaking of Bread</hi> which they are said to have <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in,</hi> and to have done from <hi>House to</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:64310:59"/>
               <hi>House,</hi> was other, than those <hi>Tables</hi> that the Apostles <hi>served,</hi> but here gave over, as finding themselves over-charged with it.</p>
            <p>Now as the increase of the Disciples did incapacitate the Apostles any more to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage this; so it would seem their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Increase and Dispersing in divers places, hindered the continuance of that Practice of having things in Common: But notwithstanding, so far at least to Remember or Continue that Antient Community, they did at certain times come together, and <hi>break Bread</hi> together. Hence it is said, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. that <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note place="margin">At <hi>Troas</hi> the <hi>Supper</hi> till <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</note> coming to <hi>Troas, And upon the first day of the Week, when the Disciples came together to Break Bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the Morrow, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his Speech until Midnight:</hi> Here is no mention made of any <hi>Sacramental Eating,</hi> but only, that <hi>Paul</hi> took occasion from their being together, to preach unto them. And it seems, it was a Supper they intended, (not a Morning-Bit of Bread and Sup of Wine) else its not very probable, that <hi>Paul</hi> would from the Morning have preached until Midnight. But the Eleventh Verse puts the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64310:59"/>
out of Dispute, which is thus: <hi>When he therefore was come up again, and had</hi> broken Bread, <hi>and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> This shews, that the <hi>Breaking</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> was deferred till that time; for those words <hi>[and when he had</hi> broken Bread, <hi>and eaten]</hi> do shew, that it had a relation to the <hi>Breaking</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and that that was the time he did it. <hi>Secondly;</hi> These words joined together, <hi>[and when he had</hi> broken Bread, <hi>and eaten, and talked]</hi> shew, it was no <hi>Religious Act</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> but only an <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">They on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did <hi>Eat</hi> for <hi>refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi>

               </note>

But if that <hi>Ceremony</hi> had been some

               <hi>Solemn Sacrifice,</hi> as <hi>some</hi> will have it, or such a <hi>Special Sacrament,</hi> as others plead it to be, it is strange, that that <hi>History,</hi> that in many lesser things gives a <hi>particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> of the <hi>Christians Behaviour,</hi> should have been so silent in the matter: Only we find, that they used sometimes to <hi>Meet together</hi> to <hi>break Bread</hi> and <hi>Eat.</hi> Now as the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> began by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to depart from that <hi>Primitive Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>

Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Supper</hi> (of the <hi>Lord,</hi> so called) Explained.</note> from <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to the End: Which place we shall particularly Examine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our <hi>Adversaries</hi> lay the <hi>chief Stress</hi> of their matter upon it; and we shall see, whether it will infer any more, than we have above granted. <hi>First,</hi> Because they were apt to use that <hi>Practice</hi> in a <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> mind beyond the <hi>true Use</hi> of it, as to make of it some <hi>Mystical Supper</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> he tells them, <hi>v.</hi> 20. That their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64310:60"/>
               <hi>Coming together into one place, is not to Eat the Lord's Supper;</hi> he saith not, <hi>This is not the right Manner to Eat,</hi> but, <hi>This is is not to Eat the Lord's Supper;</hi> because the <hi>Supper</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>Spiritual, and a Mystery. Secondly,</hi> He blames them, in that they <hi>come together for the worse,</hi> and <hi>not for the better;</hi> the Reason he gives of this, is <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>For in Eating every one hath taken before his own</hi> Supper; <hi>and one is hungry, and another is drunken:</hi> Here it <note place="margin">Why the <hi>Custom</hi> of <hi>Supping</hi> in <hi>Common</hi> was used among <hi>Christians?</hi>
               </note> is plain, that the Apostle Condemns them for that, because this Custom of Supping in general was used among Christians for to increase their Love, and as a Memorial of <hi>Christ's Supping</hi> with the <hi>Disciples,</hi> that they should have so vitiated it, to <hi>eat it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part;</hi> and to come <hi>full,</hi> who had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and <hi>hungry,</hi> who had little at home; whereby the very <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of this Practice is lost and perverted: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he blames them, that they do not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eat this in Common at home, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their Eating, till they come all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the <hi>Publick Assembly.</hi> This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly by the following <hi>verse</hi> 22. <hi>Have ye not Houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the Church of God, and shame them, that have not?</hi> Where he blames
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64310:61"/>
them for their <hi>Irregular Practice</hi> herein, in that they despised to <hi>Eat orderly,</hi> or reserve their <hi>Eating</hi> to the <hi>Publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> and so shaming such as not having <hi>Houses,</hi> nor <hi>Fulness</hi> at home, came to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the <hi>Common Table;</hi> who, being <hi>hungry,</hi> thereby were ashamed, when they observed others come thither <hi>full</hi> and <hi>drunken.</hi> Those that without prejudice will look to the place, will see, this must have been the <hi>Case</hi> among the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> For supposing the <hi>Use</hi> of this to have been then, as now <hi>used</hi> either by <hi>Papists, Lutherans</hi> or <hi>Calvinists,</hi> it is hard making sense of the Apostle's words, or indeed to conceive, what was the Abuse the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> committed in this thing. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus observed, what the Apostle said above, because this Custom of <hi>Eating and</hi>

cannot but see, if they will, that there is no Command in this place, but only an <hi>Account</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fact:</hi> He saith not, <hi>I received of the Lord, that as he took Bread, so I should command it to you to do so also;</hi> there is nothing like this in the place: Yea, on the contrary, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. where he repeats <hi>Christ's Imperative Words</hi> to his Apostles, he placeth them so, as they import no Command; <hi>This do ye, as</hi>

            <p>§ IX. But since we find, that several <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> do sufficiently shew, that <hi>Such External Rites are no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary part of the</hi> New Covenant-Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64310:64"/>
               <hi>therefore not needful now to Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,</hi> however they were for a season pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised of old; I shall instance some few of them, whereby from the Nature of the thing, as well as those <hi>Testimonies,</hi> it may appear, that the <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> is <hi>Ceas'd.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Wine</hi> is <hi>Ceased,</hi> as well as those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, confessed by our <hi>Adversaries</hi> to be so. The <hi>first</hi> is <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>For the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteousness and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost:</hi> Here the Apostle evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently shews, that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> stands not in <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> and such like things, but in <hi>Righteousness;</hi> as by the <hi>Context</hi> doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, where he is speaking of the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Hazzard</hi> of <hi>judging one another about Meats and Drinks.</hi> So then, if the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> stand not in them, nor the <hi>Gospel,</hi> nor <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> then the Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Outward Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> can be no necessary part of the <hi>Gospel-Worship,</hi> nor any <hi>perpetual Ordinance</hi> of it. Another is yet more plain of the same Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. The Apostle throughout this whole <hi>Second Chapter</hi> doth clearly plead <hi>for us,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> and against the <hi>Formality</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> of our <hi>Opposers:</hi> For in the beginning he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64310:64"/>
holds forth the great <hi>Priviledges</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have by Christ, who are come indeed to the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Christianity;</hi> and therefore he desires them, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>As they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Christ, so to walk in him, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, lest they be spoiled through Philosophy and vain Deceit, after the Rudiments or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements of the World, because that in Christ, whom they have received, is all Fulness: And that they are Circumcised with the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision made without Hands</hi> (which he calls the <hi>Circumcision</hi> of <hi>Christ) and being buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him by</hi> Baptism, <hi>are also arisen with him through the Faith of the Operation of God.</hi> Here also they did partake of the <hi>True Baptism</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> and being such, as are <hi>Arisen</hi> with him, let us see, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thinks it needful, they should make use of such <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink,</hi> as <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine, to put them in Remembrance of Christ's Death?</hi> Or whether they ought to be <hi>judged,</hi> that they did it not, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>Let no Man therefore judge you in Meat or Drink?</hi> Is not <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine, Meat and Drink?</hi> But why? <hi>Which are a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of things to come: But the Body is of Christ.</hi> Then since our <hi>Adversaries</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, <note place="margin">'Tis but a <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Shadow,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess.</note> that their <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> is a <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Shadow,</hi> therefore, according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's

Doctrine, we ought not to be <hi>Judged</hi> in the <hi>Observation</hi> of it. But is it not fit for those, that are <hi>Dead</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> to be subject to such <hi>Ordinances?</hi> See what he saith, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Wherefore, if ye be dead with Christ from the Rudiments of the World, why, as though living in the World, are ye subject to Ordinances? (Touch not, taste not, handle not: Which all are to perish with the Using) after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men:</hi> What can be more <note place="margin">And which do <hi>perish</hi> with the <hi>Using.</hi>
               </note> plain? If this serve not to take away the <hi>Absolute Necessity</hi> of the use of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> what can it serve to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?

Whereas the Apostle shews the difference, <note place="margin">The <hi>Law</hi> was <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks</hi> not so the <hi>Gospel.</hi>

               <hi>and Drinks, and divers Washings.</hi> And now, if the <hi>Gospel-Worship</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> stand in the same, where is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence?</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64310:66"/>
Grounds before mentioned: Yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for our Adversaries to shew us how they come by Power or Authority to Administer them? It cannot be from the Letter of the Scripture, else they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved also to do those other things, which the Letter declares also they did, and which in the Letter have as much Foundation. Then their power must be derived from the Apostles either Mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or Immediately; but we have shewn before, in the Tenth <hi>Proposition,</hi> that they have no Mediate Power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Interruption made by the <hi>Apostacy:</hi> And for an Immediate Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Command by the Spirit of God, to Administer these things, none of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries pretend to it.</p>
            <p>We know, that in this, as in other things, they make a Noise of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Consent</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> in all <hi>Ages:</hi> But as <hi>Tradition</hi> is not a <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tradition</hi> no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>ground</hi> for <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </note> sufficient Ground for <hi>Faith,</hi> so in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter especially it ought to have but <hi>small Weight,</hi> for that in this Point of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Superstitious Observations, the Apostacy began very arly; as may appear in the Epistles of <hi>Paul</hi> to the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64310:67"/>
               <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Colossians:</hi> And we have no ground to imitate them in those things, whose Entrance the Apostle so much withstood, so heavily regretted, and so sharply reproved.</p>
            <p>But if we look to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> we find that in such kind of Observances and Traditions, they were very uncertain and changeable; so that neither <hi>Protestants</hi> nor <hi>Papists</hi> do observe this Ceremony, as They did, both in that they gave it to Young Boys and to Little Children: <note place="margin">The <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> they gave to <hi>Young Boys</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               </note> And for ought can be learned, the Use of this and Infant-Baptism are of a like Age; though the one be laid aside both by Papists and Protestants, and the other, to wit, Baptism of Infants, be stuck to.</p>
            <p>And we have so much the less Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to lay Weight upon <hi>Antiquity,</hi> for that, if we consider their Profession of Religion, especially as to Worship, and the Ceremorial Part of it, we shall not find any Church now, whether <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Protestant,</hi> who differ nor widely from them in many things; as <hi>Daleus</hi> in his Treatise concerning the use of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <note place="margin">Daleus.</note>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:64310:67"/>
well Observeth and Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
            <p>And why they should Obtrude this upon us, because of the <hi>Ancient's Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> which they themselves <hi>follow not;</hi> or why we may not <hi>Reject This,</hi> as well as they do <hi>Other Things,</hi> no less Zealously practised by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> there is no sufficient Reason can be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed.</p>
            <p>I shall not nevertheless doubt, but that many, whose Understandings have been <hi>Clouded</hi> with these <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> have notwithstanding by the Mercy of God, had some Secret Sense of the Mystery, which they could not Clearly Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, because it was Vailed from them, by their sticking unto such Outward Things: And that through that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Sense Diving in their Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, they ran themselves into these Carnal Apprehensions, as imagining, the Substance of the Bread was Changed; or if the Substance was not changed, yet the <hi>Body</hi> was there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, I am inclinable very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64310:68"/>
to judge of <hi>Calvin</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Calvin's</hi> ingenuous <hi>Confession commended</hi>
               </note> in that he deals so ingenuously to confess, he <hi>neither Comprehends, nor can express it in Words; but yet by a feeling Experience can say, The Lord is spiritually present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as I do not doubt, but <hi>Calvin</hi> sometimes had a <hi>Sense</hi> of this <hi>Presence</hi> without the Use of this Ceremony, so as the Understanding given him of God, made him justly reject the false Notions of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> and <hi>Consubstantiation,</hi> though he knew not <hi>what to Establish</hi> instead of them: If he had fully wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that <hi>Light</hi> that makes <hi>all Things Manifest,</hi> and had not laboured in his <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 15.</note> own Comprehension, to settle upon that External Ceremony, by affixing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Presence as Chiefly or Principally, though not only (as he well knew by Experience) there, or especially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to it; he might have reached further unto the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of this Mystery, than many that went before him.</p>
            <p>§ XI. Lastly, If any now at this Day, <note place="margin">In tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Conscience</hi> at <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> God winketh.</note> from a true <hi>Tenderness</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and with real <hi>Conscience</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise this Ceremony in the same Way,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64310:68"/>
Method and Manner, as did the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians recorded in Scripture, (which yet none, that I know, now do) I should not doubt to affirm, but they might be indulged in it; and the Lord might regard them, and for a season <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> to them in the Use of these things; as many of us have known him to do to us, in the time of our Ignorance: Provided always, they did not seek to <hi>Obtrude</hi> them upon others, nor Judge such as found themselves Delivered, or that they do not pertinaciously adhere to them.</p>
            <p>For we certainly know that the Day <note place="margin">The <hi>Day</hi> is <hi>Dawn'd</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Risen,</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped</hi> in <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </note> is <hi>Dawned,</hi> in which God hath Arisen, and hath Dismissed all those <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Rites,</hi> and is only to be <hi>Worshipped</hi> in <hi>Spirit;</hi> and that he <hi>Appears</hi> to them who <hi>Wait</hi> upon him: And that to <hi>Seek God in these things</hi> is, with <hi>Mary</hi> at the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher,</hi> To <hi>seek the Living among the Dead:</hi> For we know that he is <hi>Arisen,</hi> and <hi>Revealed</hi> in <hi>Spirit,</hi> leading his <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> out of these <hi>Rudiments;</hi> that they may <hi>Walk</hi> with Him in his <hi>Light:</hi> To whom be Glory for ever!</p>
