            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.
To the unprejudiced Reader.</head>
            <p>AS the fall of man made himself and all other creatures subject to vanity; so, by reason thereof, the most noble and excellent arts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the rational soul was endued, are by the rusty canker of time brought into corruption. For Magick itself, which the ancients did so divinely contemplate, is scandalized with bearing the badge of all diabolical sorceries: which art (saith <hi>Mirandula) Pauci intelligunt, multi reprihendunt, &amp; sicut canes ignotos semper allatrant:</hi> Few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, many reprehend, and as dogs bark at those they know not: so do many condemn and hate the things they understand not. Many men there are, that abhor the very name and word <hi>Magus,</hi> because of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not <hi>Magus,</hi> but <hi>Goes,</hi> that is, familiar with evil spirits, usurped that title. But Magick and Witchcraft are far different sciences; whereof <hi>Pliny</hi> being ignorant, scoffeth thereat: for <hi>Nero</hi> (saith <hi>Pliny</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pliny lib.</hi> 30 <hi>Nat. Hist.</hi>
               </note>) who had the most excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians of the East sent him by <hi>Tyridates</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who held that kingdom by him, found the art after long study and labour altogether ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. Now Witchcraft and Sorcery, are works done meerly by the Devil, which with
<pb facs="tcp:108393:3"/>
respect unto some covenant made with man, he acteth by men his instruments, to accomplish his evil ends: of these, the histories of all ages, people and countrys, as also the holy Scriptures, afford us sundry examples.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Magus</hi> is a Persian word primitively, whereby is exprest such a one as is altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in things divine; and as <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth, the art of Magick is the art of worshiping God: &amp; the Persians called their gods Mago√∫s, hence <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius</hi> saith, that <hi>Magus</hi> is either o kak√° ph√∫sin The√≥s <hi>or</hi> therapeut√©es The√≥ne, that is, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> is a name sometimes of him that is a God by nature, and sometimes of him that is in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God: in which latter sense it is taken in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.1, 2. when the wise men came to worship Jesus, and this is the first and highest kind, which is called divine Magick; and these the Latins did intitle <hi>sapienties,</hi> or wise men: for the fear and worship of God, is the begining of knowledge. These wise men the Greeks call <hi>Philosophers</hi>; and among the Egyptians they were termed <hi>Priests</hi>: the Hebrews termed them <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balistos,</hi> Prophets, Scribes and Pharisees; and amongst the Babylonians they where known by the name of <hi>Caldeans</hi>; and by the Persians they were called <hi>Magicians</hi>: and one speaking of <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> one of the ancient Magicians, useth these words: <hi>Et verum Deum merita majestate prosequitur, &amp; angelos ministros Dei sed veri ejus
<pb facs="tcp:108393:3"/>
venerationi novit assistere; idem daemonas prodit ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renos, Vagos, humanetatis inimicos: Sosthenes</hi> ascribeth the due Majesty to the true God, and acknowledgeth that his Angels are ministers and messengers which attend the worship of the true God; he also hath delivered, that there are Devils earthly and wandering, and enemies to mankind.</p>
            <p>So that the word <hi>Magus</hi> of itself imports a contemplator of divine and heavenly Sciences; but under the name of <hi>Magick</hi> are all unlawful Arts comprehended; as Necromancy and witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, and such Arts which are effected by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination with the Devil, and whereof he is a party.</p>
            <p>These Witches and Necromancers are also called <hi>Malefici</hi> or <hi>venefici</hi>; sorcerers or poisoners; of which name Witches are rightly called, who without the art of Magick do indeed use the help of the devil himself to do mischief; practicing to mix the powder of dead bodies with other things by the help of the Devil prepared; and at other times to make pictures of wax, clay; or otherwise (as it were <hi>sacramentaliter</hi>) to effect those things which the Devil by other means bringeth to pass. Such were, and to this day partly, if not altogether, are the corruptions which hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> made odious the very name of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, having chiefly sought, as the manner of
<pb facs="tcp:108393:4"/>
all impostures is, to countefeit the highest and most noble part of it.</p>
            <p>A second kind of Magick is Astrology, which judgeth of the events of things to come, natural and human, by the motions and influences of the stars upon these lower elements, by them obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and understood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philo Judeus</hi> affirmeth, that by this part of Magick or Astrology, together with the motions of the stars and other heavenly bodies, <hi>Abraham</hi> found out the knowledge of the true God while he lived in <hi>Caldea, Qui contemplatione Creatura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, cognovit Creatorem</hi> (saith <hi>Damascen)</hi> who knew the Creator by the contemplation of the creature. <hi>Josephus</hi> reporteth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he instructed the Egyptians in Arithmetick and Astronomy; who before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s coming unto them, knew none of these Sciences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham sanctitate &amp; sapientia omnium praes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantissimus, primum Caldaeos, deinde Phenices, demum Egyptios Sacerdotes, Astrologia &amp; Divina docuerit. Abraham</hi> the holiest and wisest of men, did first teach the Caldeans, then the Phoenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, lastly the Egyptian Priests, Astrology and Divine knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:108393:4"/>Without doubt <hi>Hermes Trismegistus,</hi> that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Magician and Philosopher, who (as some say) lived long before <hi>Noah,</hi> attained to much Divine knowledge of the Creator through the study of Magick and Astrology; as his writings, to this day extant among us testify.</p>
            <p>The third kind of Magick containeth the whole Philosophy of nature; which bringeth to light the inmost virtues, and extracteth them out of natures hidden bosom to human use: <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes in centro centri latentes</hi>; Virtues hidden in the centre of the Centre, according to the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists: of this sort were <hi>Albertus, Arnaldus de villa nova, Raymond, Bacon,</hi> and others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Magick these men professed are thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined. <hi>Magia est connexio a viro sapiente agentium per naturam cum patientibus, sibi, congruenter respondentibus, ut inde opera prodeant, non sine eorum admiratione qui causam ignorant.</hi> Magick is the connexion of natural agents and patients, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>swerable to each other, wrought by a wise man, to the bringing forth of such effects as are wonderful to those that know not their causes.</p>
            <p>In all these, <hi>Zoroaster</hi> was well learned, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the first and the highest: for in his
<pb facs="tcp:108393:5"/>
Oracles he confesseth God to be the first and the highest; he believeth of the Trinity, which he would not investigate by any natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: he speaketh of Angels, and of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; approveth the immortallity of the soul; teacheth Truth, Faith, Hope, and Love; discoursing of the abstinence and charity of the <hi>Magi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this <hi>Zoroaster, Eusebius</hi> in the Theology of the Phoenicions, using <hi>Zoroaster</hi>'s own words: <hi>Haec ad verbum scribit</hi> (saith <hi>Eusebius) Deus primus, incorruptibillium, sempiternus ingenitus, expers partium, sibiipsi simillimus, bonorum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um auriga, munera non expectans, optimus, pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tissimus, pater juris, sine doctrina justitiam perdoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, natura perfectus, sapiens, sacrae naturae uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus inventor, &amp;c.</hi> Thus saith <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> word for word: God the first, incorruptable, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, unbegotten, without parts, most like himself, the guide of all good<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> expecting no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the best, the wisest, the father of right, having learned justice without teaching, perfect, wise by nature, the only inventor thereof.</p>
            <p>So that a Magician is no other but <hi>divinorum cultor &amp; interpres,</hi> a studious observer and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder of divine things; and the art itself is none other than <hi>quam Naturalis Philosophiae ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluta
<pb facs="tcp:108393:5"/>
consummatio,</hi> than the absolute perfection of natural Philosophy. Nevertheless there is a mixture in all things, of good with evil, of falshood with truth, of corruption with purity. The good, the truth, the purity, in every kind, may well be embraced: as in the ancient wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping of God by Sacrifice, there was no man knowing God among the Elders, that did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to worship the God of all power, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that kind of Worship, because the Devil was so adored in the Image of <hi>Baal, Dagon, Astaroth, Chemosh, Jupiter, Apollo,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>Neither did the abuse of Astrology terrify <hi>Abraham,</hi> (if we believe the most ancient and religious Writers) from observing the motions and natures of the heavenly bodies. Neither can it dehort wise and learned men in these days from attributing those virtues, influences, and inclinations, to the St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>rs and other Lights of heaven, which God hath given to those his glorious creatures.</p>
            <p>I must expect some calumnies and obtrecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against this from the malicious prejudiced man, and the lazy affecters of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:108393:6"/>
after so long time feeding upon solid Divinity; nor are we so umbragious and startling having been so long enlightened in Gods path, that we should relapse into that childish Age, in which <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Metaphysicks, in a council in <hi>France,</hi> was forbid to be read.</p>
            <p>But I incite the Reader to a charitable opinion hereof, with a Christian Protestation of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent purpose therein; and intreat the Reader to follow this advice of <hi>Tabaeus, Qui litigant, sint ambo in conspectu tuo mali &amp; rei.</hi> And if there be any scandel in this enterprize of mine, it is taken, not given. And this comfort I have in that Axiome of <hi>Trismegistus, Qui pius est, summe philosophatur.</hi> And therefore I present it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disguise, and object it to all of candor and indifference: and of readers, of whom there be four sorts, as one observes: Spunges, which attract all without distinguishing; Hour-glasses, which receive, and pour out as fast; Bags, which retain only the dregs of Spices, and let the Wine escape: and Sieves, which retain the best only. Some there are of the last sort, and to them I present this <hi>Occult Philosophy,</hi> knowing that they may reap good thereby.

            <p>GEOMANCY is an art of divination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the judgment may be rendered by lot, or destiny to every question of every thing whatsoever: but the art hereof consisteth especially in certain points, whereof certain figures are deducted according to the reason or rule of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallity or inequallity, likeness or unlikeness; which figures are also reduced to the caelestial figures, assuming their natures and properties, according to the course and forms of the signs and planets. Notwithstanding this in the first place we are to consider, that this kind of art can declare or shew forth nothing of verity, unless it shall be radical in some divine virtue; and this the authors of this science have demonstrated to be too-fold: the one whereof consists in religion and cerimonies; and therefore they will have the projecting of the points of this art to be made with signs in the earth: wherefore the art is appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to this element the earth, even as pyroman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108393:11"/>
moved, and directed to the terrestrial spirits; and therefore they first used certain holy incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and deprecations, with other rites and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, provoking and alluring spirits of this nature hereunto.</p>
            <p>Another power there is that doth direct and rule this lot or fortune, which is in the very soul itself of the projector, when he is carried to this work with some great egress of his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, for this art hath a natural obedience to the soul itself, and of necessity hath efficacy and is moved to that which the soul itself desires; and this way is by far more true and pure: neither matters it where or how those points are projected: therefore this art hath the same radix with the art of Astrological questions: which also can no otherwise be verified, unless with a constant and excessive affection of the Querent himself. Now then that we may proceed to the praxis of this art; first it is to be known, that all figures upon which this whole art is founded are only sixteen, as in this following table you shall see noted, with their names.</p>

            <p>Now we proceed to declare with what planets these figures are distributed: for hereupon all the propriety and nature of figures, and the judgment of the whole art dependeth: therefore the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>lesser fortune</hi> are ascribed to the Sun; but the <hi>first</hi> or <hi>greater fortune</hi> is when the sun is diurnal, and posited in his dignities; the other, or <hi>lesser fortune,</hi> is when the sun is nocturnal, or placed in less dignities. <hi>Via,</hi> and <hi>Populus,</hi> (that is, the way, and people) are referred to the moon;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108393:12"/>
the first from her beginning and increasing, the second from her full light and quarter decreasing. <hi>Acquisitio,</hi> and <hi>Laetitia,</hi> (which is gain, profit; Joy and gladness) are of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> but the first hath <hi>Jupiter</hi> the <hi>greater fortune,</hi> the second the <hi>less,</hi> but without detriment. <hi>Puella</hi> and <hi>Amissio</hi> are of <hi>Venus</hi>; the first fortunate, the other (as it were) retrograde, or combust. <hi>Conjunctio</hi> and <hi>Albus</hi> are both figures of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and are both good: but the first the more fortunate. <hi>Puer</hi> and <hi>Rubeus</hi> are figures ascribed to <hi>Mars</hi>; the first whereof hath <hi>Mars</hi> benevolent, the second male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent. <hi>Carcer</hi> and <hi>Tristtitia</hi> are both figures of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and both evil; but the first of the greater detrement. The Dargons head and Dragons tail do follow their own natures.</p>
            <p>And these are the infallable comparisons of the figures, and from these we may easily discern the equality of their signs; therefore the <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>lesser fortunes</hi> have the sign of <hi>Leo,</hi> which is the house of the Sun: <hi>Via</hi> and <hi>Populus</hi> have the sign of <hi>Cancer,</hi> which is the house of the Moon: <hi>Acquisitio</hi> hath for his sign <hi>Pisces</hi>; and <hi>Laetitia Sagittary,</hi> which are both the houses of <hi>Jupiter: Puella</hi> hath the sign of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Amissio</hi> of <hi>Libra,</hi> which are the houses of <hi>Venus: Conjunctio</hi> hath for his sign <hi>Virgo.</hi> and <hi>Albus</hi> the sign <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> the houses of <hi>Mercury: Puella</hi> and <hi>Rubeus</hi> have for their sign <hi>Scorpio,</hi> the house of <hi>Mars: Carcer</hi> hath the sign <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and <hi>Tristitia
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108393:12"/>
Aquary,</hi> the houses of <hi>Saturn:</hi> the Dragons head and tail are thus divided, the head to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn,</hi> and the Dragons tail adhereth to <hi>Scorpio:</hi> and from hence you may easily obtain the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities of these signs, after the manner of the triplicities of the signs of the zodiack: <hi>Puer</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, both <hi>fortunes,</hi> and <hi>Laetitia,</hi> do govern the fiery triplicity; <hi>Puella, Conjunctio, Carcer,</hi> and the Dragons head, the earthly triplicity: <hi>Albus, Amissio,</hi> and <hi>Tristitia,</hi> do make the airy triplicity: and <hi>Via, Populus,</hi> and <hi>Rubeus,</hi> with the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons tail, and <hi>Acquisitio,</hi> do rule the watry tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; and this order is taken according to the course or manner of the signs.</p>
            <p>But if any will constitute these triplicities accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the natures of the planets, and figures themselves, let him observe this rule, that <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna major, Rubeus, Puer,</hi> and <hi>Amissio,</hi> do make the fiery triplicity: <hi>Fortuna minor, Puella, Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titia,</hi> and <hi>Conjunctio,</hi> the triplicity of the air: <hi>Acquisitio,</hi> the Dragons tail, <hi>Via,</hi> and <hi>Populus,</hi> do govern the watry triplicity; and the earthly triplicity is ruled by <hi>Carcer, Tristitia, Albus,</hi> and the Dragons head. And this way is rather to be observed than the first which we have set forth; because it is constituted according to the rule and manner of the signs.</p>
            <p>This order is far more true and rational than that which vulgarly is used, which is described after this manner: of the fiery triplicity are,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:108393:13"/>
               <hi>Cauda, Fortuna minor, Amissio,</hi> and <hi>Rubeus</hi>: of the airy triplicity are, <hi>Acquisitio, Laetetia, Puer,</hi> and <hi>Conjunct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>o:</hi> of the watry triplicity are, <hi>Populus, Via, Albus, Puella:</hi> and <hi>Caput, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna major, Carcer,</hi> and <hi>Tristitia,</hi> are of the earthly triplicity.</p>
            <p>They do likewise distribute these figures to the twelve signs of the zodiack, after this manner; <hi>Acquisitio,</hi> is given to <hi>Aries; Fortuna</hi> both <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> to <hi>Taurus; Laetitia</hi> to the sign <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini; Puella</hi> and <hi>Rubeus</hi> to <hi>Cancer; Albus</hi> is assigned to <hi>Leo, Via</hi> to <hi>Virgo</hi>; the Dragons head and <hi>Conjunctio</hi> to <hi>Libra; Puer</hi> is submitted to <hi>Scorpio; Tristitia</hi> and <hi>Amissio</hi> are assigned to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittary</hi>; the Dragons tail to <hi>Capricorn; Populus</hi> to <hi>Aquarius</hi> and <hi>Carcer</hi> is assigned to to the sign <hi>Pisces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we come to speak of the manner of projecting or setting down these figures, which is thus; that we set down the points according to their course in four lines, from the right hand towards the left, and this in four courses: there will therefore result unto us four figures made in four several lines, according to the even or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even marking every several line; which four fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures are wont to be called <hi>Matres:</hi> which do bring forth the rest, filling up and compleating the whole figure of judgment, an example whereof you may see here following.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:108393:13"/>
               <figure/>
            </p>
            <p>Of these four <hi>Matres</hi> are also produced four other secondary figures, which they call <hi>Filiae,</hi> or succedents, which are gathered together after this manner, that is to say, by making the four <hi>Matres</hi> according to their order, placing them by course one after another **; then that which shall result out of every line maketh the figure of <hi>Fileae,</hi> the order whereof is by descending from the superior points through both <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After the same manner they are produced out of the last four figures, that is to say, of the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth, two figures, which they call <hi>Coadjutrices</hi> or <hi>Testes</hi>; out of which two is also one constituted, which is called the index of the whole figure, or thing quesited: as appeareth in this example following.</p>

            <p>As the former <hi>Matres</hi> do make the four angles of an house, the first maketh the first angle, the second the second angle, the third maketh the third angle, and the fourth the fourth angle; so

            <p>But here we shall give you the secret of the art of finding out the Index in the subsequent figure, which is thus: that you number all the points which are contained in the lines of the projections, and this you shall divide by twelve: and that which remaineth project from the ascendent by the several houses, and upon which house there falleth a final unity, that figure giveth you a competent judgment of the thing quesited; and this together with the significations of the judgments aforesaid. But if on either part they shall be equal, or ambiguous, then the index alone shall certifie you of the thing quesited. The example of this Figure is here placed.</p>

            <p>The first house sheweth the person of the querent, as often as a question shall be proposed concerning himself, of his own matters, or any thing apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to him. And this house declareth the

The sixth house giveth judgment of infirmities, and medicines; of familiars and servants; of cattle and domestic animals. the seventh house signifieth wedlock, whoredom, and fornication; rendereth judgment of friends, strifes, and controversies; rendereth judgment of Judges.

            <p>IN our Books of Occult Philosophy, we have not so compendiously, as copiously, declared the principles, grounds, and reasons
<pb n="**" facs="tcp:108393:33"/>
of Magick itself, and after what manner the experiments thereof are to be chosen, elected, and compounded, to produce many wonderful effects; but because in those books they are treated of, rather Theorically, than Practically; and some also are not handled completely and fully, and others very figuratively, and as it were Enigmatically and obscure Riddles, as being those we have attained to with great study, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and very curious searching and explora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are heretofore set forth in a more rude and unfashioned manner.</p>
            <p>Therefore in this book, which we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and made as it were a Complement and Key of our other books of Occult Philosophy, and of all Magical Operations, we will give unto thee the documents of holy and undefiled verity, and inexpugnable and unresistable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical discipline, and the most pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable experiments of the sacred deities. So that as by the reading of our other books of Occult Philosophy, thou mayest earnestly covet the knowledge of these things; even so with reading this Book, thou shalt truely tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Wherefore let silence hide these things within the secret Closets of thy Religious Breast, and conceal them with constant Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citurnity.</p>

               <pb n="**" facs="tcp:108393:34"/>This therefore is to be known, That the names of the intelligent presidents of every one of the Planets are constituted after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: that is to say, by collecting together the letters out of the figure of the World, from the rising of the body of the Planet, according to the succession of the Signs through the several degrees; and out of the several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, from the Aspects of the Planet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the calculation being made from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the ascendant.</p>
            <p>In the like manner are constituted the names of the Princes of the evil Spirits; they are taken under all the Planets of the presidents in a retrograde order, the projection being made contrary to the succession of the Signs, from the begining of the seventh house. Now the name of the supreme and highest intelligence, which many do suppose to be the soul of the world, is collected out of the four Cardinal points of the figure of the world, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner already delivered: and by the opposite and contrary way, is known the name of the great <hi>Daemon,</hi> or evil Spirit, upon the four Cadent Angles.</p>
            <p>In the like manner shalt thou understand the names of the great presidential Spirits ruling in the Air, from the four Angles of the
<pb n="**" facs="tcp:108393:34"/>
succedant houses: so that as to obtain the names of the good spirits, the calculation is to be made according to the succession of the signs, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the degree of the ascendant: and to attain to the names of the evil spirits, by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contrary way.</p>
            <p>You must also observe, that the names of the evil spirits are extracted, as well from the names of the good spirits, as of the evil: so notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that if we enter the table with the name of a good spirit of the second order, the name of the evil spirit shall be extracted from the order of the Princes and Governors: but if we enter the table with the name of a good Spirit of the third order, or with the name of an evil Spirit a Governor, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner soever they are extracted, whether by this table, or from a celestial figure, the names which do proceed from hence, shall be the names of the evil spirits, the Ministers of the inferior order.</p>
            <p>It is further to be noted, That as often as we enter this table with the good Spirits of the second order, the names extracted are of the second order; and if under them we extract the name of an evil Spirit, he is of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior order of the Governors. The same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is, if we enter with the name of an evil
<pb n="**" facs="tcp:108393:35"/>
Spirit of the superior order. If therefore we enter this table with the names of the Spirits of the third order, or with the names of the ministering Spirits as well of the good Spirits, as of the evil, the names extracted shall be the names of the ministering Spirits of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior order.</p>
            <p>But many Magicians, men of no small Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, will have the tables of this kind to be extended with Latin Letters: so that by the same tables also, out of the name of any office or effect, might be found out the name of any spirit, as well good as evil, by the same manner which is above delivered, by taking the name of the office or of the effect, in the column of letters, in their own line, under their own star. And of this practice <hi>Trismegistus</hi> is a great Author, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered this kind of calculation in Egyptian let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: not unproperly also may they be referred to other letters of other tongues, for the reasons as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to the signs; for truly he only is extant of all men, who have treated concerning the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the names of spirits.</p>
            <p>Therefore the force, secrecy and power, in what manner the sacred names of spirits are truly &amp; right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found out, consisteth in the disposing of vowels, which do make the name of a spirit, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with is constituted the true name &amp; right word.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:108393:35"/>
Now this art is thus perfected and brought to pass; first, we are to take heed of placing the vowels of the letters, which are found by the calculation of the celestial fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ure, to find the names of the spirits of the second order, Presidents and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors. And this in the good spirits, is thus brought to effect, by considering the stars which do constitute and make the letters, and by plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them according to their order: First let the degree of the eleventh house be substracted from the degree of that star which is First in order; and that which remaineth thereof, let it be projected from the degree of the ascendant; and where that number endeth, there is part of the vowel of the First letter: begin therefore to calculate the vowels of these letters, according to their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and order; and the vowel which falleth in the place of the star, which is the first in order, the same vowel is attributed to the First letter. Then afterwards thou shalt find the part of the second letter, but substracting the degree of a star, which is the second in order from the first star; and that which remaineth, cast from the ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. And this is the part from which thou shalt begin the calculation of the vowels; and that vowel which falleth upon the second star, the same is the vowel of the second letter: and so consequently mayest thou search out the vowels of the following letters always, by substracting the degree of the following star, from the degree of the star next preceding and going before.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:108393:36"/>
And so also all calculations, and numerations in the names of the good spirits, ought to be made according to the successions of the signs. And in calculating the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>mes of the evil spirits, where in the names of the good spirits is taking the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the eleventh house, in these ought to be taken the degree of the twelfth house. And all numerations and calculations may be made with the succession of the signs, by taking the beginning from the degree of the tenth house.</p>
            <p>But in all extractions by tables, the vowels are placed after another manner. In the first place therefore is taken the certain number of letters making the name itself, &amp; is thus numbered from the beginning of the column of the first letter, or whereupon the name is extracted; and the letter on which this number falleth, is referred to the first letter of the name, extracted by taking the distance of the one from the other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of the alphabet. But the number of that distance is projected from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his column; and where it endeth, there is part of the first vowel: from thence therefore thou shalt calcul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>te the vowels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in their own number and order, in the same column; and the vowel which shall fall upon the first letter of a name, the same shall be at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to that name. Now thou shalt find the following vowels, by taking the distance from the precedent vowel to the following: and so
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:108393:36"/>
consequently according to the succession of the alphabet. And the number of that distance is to be numbered from the beginning of his own column; and where he shall cease, there is part of the vowel sought after. From thence therefore must you calculate the vowels, as we have abovesaid; and those vowels which shall fall upon your own letters, are to be attributed unto them: if therefore any vowel should happen to fall upon a vowel, the former must give place to the latter: and this you are to understand only of the good spirits. In the evil spirits also you may proceed in the same way; except only that you make the numerations after a contrary and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward order, contrary to the succession of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet, and contrary to the order of the columns (that is to say) in ascending.</p>
            <p>The name of good Angels, and of every man, which we have taught how to find out, in our third book of Occult Philosophy, according to that manner, is of no little authority, nor of a mean foundation. But now we will give unto thee some other ways, illustrated with no vain reasons. one whereof is, by taking in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the nativity, the five places of Hylech; which being noted, the characters of the letters are projected in their order and number from the beginning of <hi>Aries</hi>; and those letters which fall upon the degrees of the said places, accord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ng to their order and dignity disposed and aspected,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:108393:37"/>
do make the name of an Angel. There is also another way wherein they do take Almutel, which is the ruling and governing star over the aforesaid five places; and the projection is to be made from the degree of the ascendant; which is done by gathering together the letters falling upon Almutel, which being placed in order, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their dignity, do make the name of an Angel. There is furthermore another way used, and very much had in observation from the Egyptians, by making their calculations from the degree of the ascendant, and by gathering together the letters according to the Almutel of the eleventh house; which house they call a good <hi>Damon:</hi> which being placed according to their dignities, the names of the Angels are constituted. Now the names of the evil Angels are known after the like manner except only that the projections must be performed contrary to the course and order of the succession of the signs: so that whereas in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the names of good spirits, we are to calculate from the beginning of <hi>Aries</hi>; contrariwise, in attaining the names of the evil, we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from the beginning of <hi>Libra.</hi> And whereas in the good spirits we number from the degree of the ascendant; contrarily, in the evil, we must calculate from the degree of the seventh house. But according to the Egyptians, the name of an Angel is collected according to the Almutel of the twelfth house which they call an evil spirit. Now all those rites, which are
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:108393:37"/>
elsewhere already by us delivered in our third book of Occult Philosophy, may be made by the characters of any language. In all which (as we have abovesaid) there is a mystical and divine number, order and figure; from whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to pass, that the same spirit may be called by divers names. But others are discovered from the name of the spirit himself, of the good or evil, by tables formed to this purpose.</p>
            <p>Now these celestial characters do consist of lines and heads: the heads are six, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the six magnitudes of the stars, whereunto the planets also are reduced. The first magnitude holdeth a star, with the Sun, or a cross. The second with Jupiter a circular point. The third holdeth with Saturn, a semicircle, a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, either crooked, round or accute. The fourth with Mars, a little stroke penetrating the line, either square, straight, or oblique. The fifth with Venus and Mercury, a little stroke or point with a tail, ascending or descending. The sixth with the Moon, a point made black. All which you may see in the ensuing table. The heads then being posited according to the site of the stars of the figure of heaven, then the lines are to be drawn out according to the congruency or agreement of their natures. And this you are to understand of the fixed stars. But in the erecting of the Planets, the lines are drawn out, the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:108393:38"/>
heads being posited according to their course and nature amongst themselves.</p>

            <p>But the characters which are extracted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the name of a spirit, are composed by the table following, by giving to every letter

that name which agreeth unto him, out of the table; which although it may appear easy to those that apprehend it, yet there is herein no small difficulty; to wit, when the letter of a name falleth upon the line of letters or figures, that we may know which figure or which letter is to be taken. And this may be thus known: for if a letter falleth upon the line of letters, consider of what number this letter may be in the order of the name; as the second or the third: then how many letters that name containeth; as five or seven; and multiply these numbers one after another by themselves, and treble the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct then cast the whole (being added together) from the beginning of the letters according to the succession of the alphabet: and the letter upon which that number shall happen to fall, ought to be placed for the character of that spirit. But if any letter of a name fall on the line of figures, it is thus to be wrought. Take the number how many this letter is in the order of the name, and let it be multiplied by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which this letter is in the order of the alphabet; and being added together, divide it by nine, and the remainder sheweth the figure or number to be placed in the character: and this may be put either in a Geometrical or Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metical figure of number; which notwithstanding ought not to exceed the number of nine, or nine Angels.</p>

            <p>But the Characters which are understood by the revelation, of Spirits, take their virtue from thence; because they are as it were, certain hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den seats, making the harmony of some divinity: either they are signs of a covenant entered into and of promised and plighted faith, or of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And those characters cannot by any other means be searched out.</p>
            <p>Moreover, besides these Characters, there are certain familiar Figures and Images of evil spirits, under which forms they are wont to appear, and yeild obedience to them that invoke them. And all these characters or Images may be seen by the table following, according to the course of the letters constituting the names of spirits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: so that if in any letter there is found more than the name of one spirit, his Image holdeth the preeminence the others imparting their own order; so that they which are the first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to them is attributed the head, the upper part of the body, according to their own figure; those which are lowest do possess the thighs and feet; so also the midde letters do attribute like to themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:108393:40"/>
give the parts that sit. But if their happen any contrarity, that letter which is the stronger in the number shall bear rule: and if they are equal, they all impart equal things. Furthermore if any name shall obtain any notable character or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the table, he shall likewise have the same character in the Image.</p>
            <p>We may also attain to the knowledge of the dignities of the evil spirits, by the same tables of characters &amp; images: for upon what spirit soever their falleth any excellent sign or instrument out of the table of characters, he possesseth that dignity. As if their should be a crown, it sheweth a Kingly dignity; if a crest or plume, a Dukedom; if a horn, a county, if without these there be a scepter, sword, or forked instrument, it sheweth rule &amp; authority. Likewise out of the table of images you shall find them which bear the chief Kingly dignity: from the crown judge dignity; &amp; from the instruments, rule &amp; authority. Lastly, they which bear an human shape and figure, have greater dignity than those which appear under the forms &amp; images of beasts; they also who ride, do excel them which appear on foot. And thus according to all their commixtures, you may judge the dignity &amp; excellency of spirits, one before another. Moreover, you must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the spirits of the inferior order, of what dignity soever they be, are always subject to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the superior order: so also, that it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruent for their Kings &amp; Dukes to be subject &amp; minister to the presidents of the superior order.</p>

for us to constitute and make the pentacles, they are the characters of the good spirits, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and chiefly of the good spirits of the first and second order, and sometimes also of the third order. And these kind of characters are especially to be named holy; and then those characters which we have above called holy. What character soever therefore of this kind is to be instituted we must draw about him a double circle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we must write the name of his Angel: and if we will add some divine name congruent with his spirit and office, it will be of the greater force and efficacy. And if we will draw about him any angular figure, according to the manner of his numbers, that also shall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done. But the holy pictures which do make the pentacles are they which every where are delivered unto us in the Prophets and sacred writings, as well of the old as of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: even as the figure of the serpent hanging on the cross, and such like; whereof very many may be found out of the visions of the Prophets, as of <hi>Esaias, Daniel, Esdras,</hi> and others, and also out of the revelations of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> And we have spoken of them in our third Book of Occult philosophy, where we have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy things. Therefore when any pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is posited of any of these holy Images, let the circle be drawn round about it on each side thereof, wherein let there be written some divine

name, that is apt and conformed to the effect of that figure, or else there may be written about it some versicle taken out of part of the body of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, which may desire to ascertain or deprecate the desired effect. As, if a pentacle were to be made to gain victory or revenge against ones enemies, as well visible as in invisible, the figure may be taken out of the second book of the <hi>Macchabees:</hi> that is to say, a hand holding a golden sword drawn, about which let there be written the versicle there contained; to wit, <note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108393:45"/>
of the name be whole and totally placed, or at least principally.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes also we constitute pentacles, by making the revolution of some kind of name, in a square table, and by drawing about it a single or double circle, and by writing therein some holy versicle competent and befiting this name, or from which that name is extracted. And this is the way of making the pentacles, according to their several distinct forms and fashions, which we may as we please either multiply or commix together by course among themselves, to work the greater efficacy, and extention and enlargment of force and virtue.</p>
            <p>As, if a deprication would be made for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow and destruction of ones enemies, then we are to mind and call to remembrance how God destroyed the face fo the whole earth in the deluge of waters, and the destruction of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha,</hi> by raining down fire and brimstone; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, how God overthrew <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his host in the Red-Sea, and to call to mind if any other malediction or curse be found in holy writ. And thus in things of the like sort. So likewise in depricating and praying against perils and dangers of waters, we ought to call to remembrance the saving of <hi>Noah</hi> in the deluge of waters the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> through the Red-Sea; and also we are to mind how Christ walked on the waters, and how he saved the ship in danger
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:108393:45"/>
to be cast away with the tempest; and how he commanded the winds and the waves and they obeyed him; and also, that he drew <hi>Peter</hi> out of the water, being in danger of drowning, and the like. And lastly, with these we invoke and call upon some certain and holy names of God; to wit, such as are significative to accomplish our desire, and accommodated to the desired effect: as, if it be to overthrow enemies, we are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and call upon the names of wrath, revenge, fear justice, and fortitude of God: and if we would avoid and escape any evil or danger, we then call upon the names of mercy, defence, salvation, fortitude, goodness, and such like names of God. When also we pray unto God that he would grant unto us our desires, we are likewise to intermix therewith the name of some good spirit, whether one only, or more, whose office it is to execute our desires: and sometimes also we require some evil spirit to restrain or compel, whose name likewise we intermingle; and that rightly, especially, if it be to execute any evil work; as, revenge, punishment, or destruction.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if there be any versicle in the Psalms, or in any other part of holy Scripture, that shall seem congruent and agreeable to our desire, the same is to be mingled with our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Now after prayer hath been made unto God, it is expedient afterwards to make an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:108393:46"/>
to that executioner whom in our precedent prayer unto God we have desired should a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er he be an Angel, or star, or soul, or any of the noble Angels. But this kind of Oration ought to be composed according to the rules which we have delivered in the second book of Occult Philosophy, where we have treated of the manner of the composition of enchantments.</p>
            <p>You may know further, that these kind of bonds have a threefold difference: for the first bond is when we conjure by natural things; the second is compounded of religious myst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>unto: as, in the conjuration of Serpents, by commemorat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the curse of the Serpent in the earthly Paradise, and the setting up the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Thou shalt walk upon the Asp and the Basilisk,</hi> &amp;c. Superstition also is of much prevalency herein, by the translation of some sacramental rites, to bind that which we intend to hinder; as, the rites of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of sepulcres, funerals, buryings, and the like.</p>
            <p>And now we come to treat of the consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which men ought to make upon all instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and things necessary to be used in this art: and the virtue of this consecration most chiefly consists in two things; to wit, in the power of the person consecrating, and by the virtue of the prayer by which the consecration is made. For in the person consecrating, there is required holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of life, and power of sanctifying: both which are acquired by dignification and initiation. And that the person himself shall with a firm and undoubted faith believe the virtue, power, and efficacy thereof. And then in the prayer itself, by which this consecration is made, there is required the like holiness; which either solely consisteth in the prayer itself, as, if it be by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inspiration ordained to this purpose, such as we have in many places of the holy Bible; or that it be hereunto instituted through the power of the holy spirit, in the ordination of the Church. Otherwise there is in the prayer a sanctimony, which is not only by itself, but by the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of holy things; as, the commemoration

This is therefore to be known and firmly observed, that if any consecration be to be made of things profane, in which there is any pollution, or defilement, then an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcising and expiation of those things ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the consecration. Which things being so made pure, are more apt to receive the influences of the divine virtues. We are also to observe, that in the end of every consecration after that the prayer is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So then, in the consecration of water, we ought to commemorate how that God hath placed the firmament in the midst of the waters, and in what manner that God placed the fountain of waters in the earthly Paradise, from thence sprang four holy rivers, which watered the whole earth. Likewise we are to call to remembrance in w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; and also, how he went before the children of Israel in a pillar of fire; and that nothing can be duely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, sacrificed, or sanctified, without fire; and how that God instituted fire to be kept continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the tabernacle of the covenant; and how miraculously he re-kindled the same, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and preserved it elsewhere from going out, being hidden under the waters: and things of this sort. Likewise the names of God are to be called upon which are consonant hereunto, as, it is read in the Law and the Prophets, that God is a consuming fire, and if there be any of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine name which signify fire, or such-like names; as the glory of God, the light of God, the splendor and brightness of God.</p>
            <p>And likewise in the consecration of Oil and Perfumes, we are to call remembrance such holy things as are pertinent to this purpose, which we read in <hi>Exodus</hi> of the holy anointing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:108393:48"/>
Oil, and divine names significant thereunto, such as is the name Christ, which signifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed: and what mysteries there are hereof; as that in the <hi>Revelations</hi> of the two Olive-trees distilling holy oil into the lamps that burn before the face of God and the like.</p>
            <p>And the blessing of the lights, wax, and lamps, is taken from the fire, and the altar which containeth the substance of the flame: and what other such similitudes as are in myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; as that of the seven candlesticks &amp; lamps burning before the face of God.</p>
            <p>These therefore are the consecrations which first of all are necessary to be used in every kind of devotion, and ought to precede it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which nothing in holy Rites can be duely performed.</p>
            <p>In the next place now we shall shew unto you the consecration of places, instruments, and such like things.</p>
            <p>Therefore when you would consecrate any place or circle, you ought to take the prayer of Solomon used in the dedication of the Temple: and moreover, you must bless the place with the sprinkling of holy-water, and with fumigations; by commemorating in the benediction holy mysteries; such as these are, <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>There is furthermore, besides these, another rite of consecration, of wonderful power, and much efficacy; And this is out of the kinds of superstitions; that is to say, when the rite of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration or collection of any Sacrament in the Church is transferred to that thing which we would consecrate.</p>
            <p>It is to be known also, that vows, Oblations, and Sacrafice, have the power of Consecration, as well real as personal; and they are as it were certain covenants and conventions between those
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108393:50"/>
names with which they are made, and us who make them, strongly cleaving to our desire and wished effect: as when we dedicate, offer, and sacrafice, with certain names or things; as, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migations, unctions, rings, images, looking-glasses; and things less material, as deities, sigils, pentacles, inchantments, orations, pictures, and Scriptures: of which we have largely spoken in our third book of Occult philosophy.</p>
            <p>There is extant amongst those magicians (who do most use the ministery of evil spirits a certain rite of invocating spirits by a book to be Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating before to that purpose; which is properly called, <note n="¬ß" place="bottom">

            <p>Now this book is to be made of most pure and clean paper, that hath never been used before; which many do call <hi>Virgin paper.</hi> And this book must be inscribed after this manner; that is to say, let there be placed on the left side the image of the spirit, and on the right side his character, with the oath above it containing the name of the spirit &amp; his dignity and place, with his office &amp; power. Yet very many do compose this book o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise omitting the characters or image: but

               </gap>ll and singular the spirits who are written in the book be called to the circle, according to the rites and order which we have befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>e taught; and the book that is to be consecrated, let it be placed without the Circle in a triangle. And in the first place, let there be read in the presence of the spirits all the oaths which are written in that book; and then the book to be consecrated being placed without the Circle in a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>iangle there drawn, let all the spirits be compelled to impose their hands where their images and characters are drawn,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108393:51"/>
and to confirm and Consecrate the same with a special and common oath. Which being done, let the book be taken and shut, and preserved as we have before spoken, and let the spirits be licensed to depart, according to due and right order.</p>
            <p>There is another manner of Consecrating a book of spirits which is more easy, and of much efficacy to produce every effect, except that in opening this book the spirits do not always come visible. And this way is thus: let there be made a book of spirits as we have before set forth; but in the end thereof let there be written invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and bonds and strong Conjurations where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with every spirit may be bound. Then this book must be bound between two tables or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, and in the inside thereof let there be drawn the holy pentacles of the divine Majesty, which we have before set forth and described out of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi>: then let the first of them be placed in the beginning of the book, and the second at the end of the same. This book being perfected after this manner, let it be brought in a clear and fair time, to a Circle prepared in a cross way, according to the Art which we have before delivered; and there in the first place the book being opened. let it be Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the rites and ways which we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared concerning Consecration. Which being done, let all the spirits be called which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108393:51"/>
are written in the book in their own order and place, by conjuring them thrice by the bonds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the book, that they come unto that place within the space of three days, to assure their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and confirm the same, to the book so to be consecrated. Then let the book be wrapped up in clean linen, and buried in the middle of the Circle, and there fast stopped up: and then the Circle being destroyed, after the spirits are licensed, depart before the rising of the Sun: and on the third day, about the middle of the night, return, and new make the Circle, and with bended knees make prayer and giving thanks unto God, and let a precious perfume be made, and open the hole, and take out the book; and so let it be kept, not opening the same. Then you shall license the spirits in there order, and destroying the Circle, depart before the sun rise. And this is the last rite and manner of consecrating profitable to whatsoever writings &amp; experiments, which do direct the spirits, placing the same between two holy lamens or pentacles, as before is shewn.</p>
            <p>But the operator, when he would work by the Book thus consecrated, let him do it in a fair and clear season, when the spirits are least trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and let him place him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>rds the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the spirits. Then let him open the book under a due register; let him invoke the spirits by their oath there described and confirmed, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:108393:52"/>
by the name of their character and image, to that purpose which you desire: and if there be need, conjure them by the bonds placed in the end of the book. And having attained your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired effect, then you shall license the spirits to depart.</p>
            <p>And now we shall come to speak concerning the invocation of spirits, as well of the good spirits as of the bad.</p>
            <p>The good spirits may be invocated of us divers ways, and in sundry manners do offer themselves unto us. For they do openly speak to those that watch<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and do offer themselves to our sight, or do inform us in dreams by oracle of those things which are desired. Whosoever therefore would call any good spirit, to speak or appear in sight, it behoveth them especially to observe two thing: one whreof is about the disposition of the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; the other about those things which are outwardly to be adhibited to the invocation, for the conformity of the spirits to be called. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth therefore that the invocant himself be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ly disposed for many days to such a mystery. In the first place therefore, he ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and contrite, both inwardly and outwardly, and rightly expiated by daily washing himself with holy water. Moreover, the invocant ought to conserve himself all these days, chast, absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and to seperate himself as much as may be done, from all preturbation of mind, and from
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:108393:52"/>
all manner of foreign and secular business. Also, he shall observe fasting all these days, as much as shall seem convenient to him to be done. Also, let him daily between sun-rising and sun-setting, being cloathed with a holy linen garment, seven times call upon God, and make a deprecation to the Angels to be called according to the rule which we have before taught. Now the number of days of fasting and preparation is commonly the time of a whole Lunation. There is also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother number observed amongst the Cabalists, which is forty days.</p>
            <p>Now concerning those things which do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this rite of invocation, the first is, that a place be chosen, clean, pure, close, quiet, free from all manner of noise, and not subject to any strangers sight. This place must first be exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised and consecrated: and let there be a table or altar placed therein, covered with clean white linen, and set towards the east: and on each side thereof let there be set two consecrated wax-lights burning, the flame whereof ought not to go out all these days. In the middle of the altar, let there be placed lamens, or the holy paper which we have before described, covered with fine linen; which is not to be opened until the end of these days of the consecration. You shall also have in readiness a precious perfume, and pure anointing oil; and let them be both kept consecrated. There must also a Censer be set on
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:108393:53"/>
the head of the altar, wherein you shall kindle the holy fire, and make a perfume every day that you shall pray. You shall also have a long gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of white linen, close before and behi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now we will declare unto you another rite more easy to perform this thing: that is to say, let the man that is to receive and Oracle from the good spirits, be chast, pure, and confess'd.

                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>e the place, and bless it, and make a Circle therein with a sanctified cole; and let there be written in the uttermost part of the Circle the names of the Angels, and and in the inner part thereof let there be written the mighty names of God: and let him place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Circle, at the four angles of the World, the Censers for the perfumes. Then let him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the place fasting, and washed, and let him begin to pray towards the east this whole Psalm: <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Psalm</hi> 119.</note> 
               <hi>Beati immaculati in via,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Blessed are the undefiled in the way,</hi> &amp;c. by perfuming; and in the end depricating the Angels, by the said
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:108393:54"/>
divine names, that they will deign to discover &amp; reveal that which he desireth: and that let him do six days, continuing washed and fasting. And on the seventh day, which is the Sabbath, let him, being washed and fasting, enter the Circle, and perfume it, and anoint himself with holy anointing oil, by anointing his forehead, and upon both his eyes, and in the palms of his hands, and upon his feet. Then upon his knees let him say the Psalm aforesaid, with divine and Angelical names. Which being said let him arise, let him begin to walk about in a Circle within the said Circle from the east to the west, until he is wearied with a dizziness of his brain: let him fall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>own in the Circle, and there he may rest; and forthwith he shall be wrapt up in an extasy, and a spirit will appear unto him, which will inform him of all things. We must observe also, that in the Circle there ought to be four holy candles burning at the four parts of the world, which ought not to want light for the space of a whole week. And the manner of fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing must be such, that he abstain from all things having a life of sence, and from those which do proceed from them: and let him only drink pure running water: neither let him take any food till the going down of the sun. And let the perfume and the holy anointing oil be made, as is set forth in <hi>Exodus</hi> and the other holy books of the Bible. It is also to be observed, that always
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:108393:55"/>
as often as he enters into the Circle, he hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his forehead a golden Lamen, upon which there must be written the name <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> as we have before spoken.</p>
            <p>But natural things, and their commixtures, do also belong unto us, and are conducing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Oracles from any spirit by a dream: which are either perfumes, unctions, and meats or drinks: which you may understand in our first book of Occult Philosophy.</p>
            <p>But he that is willing always and readily to receive the oracles of a dream, let him make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himself a ring of the Sun or of Saturn for this purpose. There is also an image to be made, of excellent efficacy and power to work this effect; which being put under his head when he goeth to sleep, doth effectually give true dreams of what thing soever the mind hath before deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined or consulted on. The table of numbers do likewise confer to receive an oracle, being duely formed under their own Constellations. And these thou mayest know in the third book of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Philosophy.</p>
            <p>Holy tables and papers do also serve to this effect, being specially composed and consecrated: such as is the Almudel of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the table of the revolutions of the name <hi>Tetragrammaton.</hi> And those things which are of this kind, and written unto these things, out divers figures, numbers, holy pictures, with the inscriptions of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:108393:55"/>
the holy names of God and of Angels; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position whereof is taken out of divers places of the holy Scriptures, Psalms, and versicles, and other certain promises of the divine revelations and prophecies.</p>
            <p>To the same effect do conduce holy prayers &amp; imprecations, as well unto God, as to the holy Angels and heros: the imprecations of which prayers are to be composed as we have before shewn, according to some religious similitude of miracles, graces, and the like, making mention of those things which we intend to do: as, out of the old Testament, of the dream of <hi>Jacob, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph, Pharaoh, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadnezzer:</hi> if out of the new Testament, of the dream of <hi>Joseph</hi> the husband of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; of the dream of the three wisemen; of <hi>John</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist sleeping upon the breast of our Lord; and whatsoever of the like kind can be found in religion, miracles, and revelations; as, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the cross to <hi>Helen,</hi> the revelations of <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the great, the revelations of <hi>Bridget, Cyril, Methodius, Mechtild, Joa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim, Merhir,</hi> and such like. According to which let the deprecations be composed, if when he goeth to sleep it be with a firm intention: and the rest well disposing themselves, let them pray devoutly, and without doubt they will afford a powerful effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:108393:56"/>Now he that knoweth how to compose those things which we have now spoken of, he shall receive the most true oracles of dreams. And this he shall do; observe those things which in the second book of Occult Philosophy are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning this thing. He that is desirous therefore to receive an oracle, let him abstain from supper and from drink, and be otherwise well disposed, his brain being free from turbulent vapours; let him also have his bed-chamber fair and clean, exorcised and consecrated if he will; then let him perfume the same with some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient fumigation; and let him anoint his temples with some unguent efficatious hereunto, and put a ring upon his finger, of the things above spoken of: let him take either some image, or holy table, or holy paper, and place the same under his head: then having made a devout prayer, let him go unto his bed, and meditating upon that thing which he desireth to know, let him so sleep; for so shall he receive a most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and undoubted oracle by a dream, when the Moon goeth through th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>t sign which was in the ninth house of his nativity, and also when she goeth through the sign of the ninth house of the revolution of his nativity; and when she is in the ninth sign from the sign of perfection. And this is the way and means whereby we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all sciences and arts whatsoever, suddenly and perfectly, with a true illumination of our
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:108393:56"/>
understanding; although all inferior familiar spirits whatsoever do conduce to this effect; and sometimes also evil spirits sensibly informing us intrinsically or extrinsically.</p>
            <p>But if we would call any evil spirit to the circle, it first behoveth us to consider, and to know his nature, to which of the planets it agreeth, and what offices are distributed to him from the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; and being known, let there be sought out a place fit and proper for his invocation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the Planet, and the quality of the offices of the said spirit, as near as the same may be done: as, if their power be over the Sea, Rivers or Floods, then let the the place be chosen in the shore; and so of the rest. Then let there be chosen a convenient time, both for the quality of the air, serene, clear, quiet, and fitting for the spirits to assume bodies; as also of the quality and nature of the planet, and of the spirit, as to wit, on his day, or the time wherein he ruleth: he may be fortunate or unfortunate, sometimes of the day, and sometimes of the night, as the stars and spirits do require. These things being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, let there be a circle framed in the place elected, as well for the defence of the invocant, as for the confirmation of the spirit. And in the circle itself there are to be written the divine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral names, and those things which do yield de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence unto us; and with them, those divine names which do rule this planet, and the offices
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108393:57"/>
of the spirit himself; there shall also be written therein, the names of the good spirits which do bear rule, and are able to bind and constrain that spirit which we intend to call. And if we will any more fortify and strengthen our circle, we may add characters and pentacles agreeing to the work; then also if we will, we may either within or without the circle, frame an angular figure, with the inscription of such convenient numbers, as are congruent amongst themselves to our work, which are also to be known, according to the manner of numbers and figures: of which in the second book of occult philosophy it is sufficiently spoken. Furthermore, he is to be provided of lights, perfumes, unguents and medicines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded according to the nature of the planet and spirit: which do partly agree with the spirit, by reason of their natural and coelestial virtue; and partly are exhibited to the spirit for religious and superstitious worship. Then he must be furnished with holy and consecrated things, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary as well for the defence of the invocant, and his fellows, as also serving for bonds to bind and constrain the spirits; such as are either holy papers, lamens, pictures, pentacles, swords, scepters, garments of convenient matter and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and things of the like sort. Then when all these things are provided, and the Master and his fellows being in the circle, in the first place let him consecrate the circle, and all those things
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:108393:57"/>
which he useth; which being performed with a conenient gesture and countenance, let him begin to pray with a loud voice, after this manner. First let him make an oration unto God, and then let him intreat the good spirits: and if he will read any prayers, psalms, or gospels for his defence, they ought to take the first place. After these prayers and orations are said, then let him begin to invoeate the spirit which he desireth, with a gentle and loving Inchantment, to all the coasts of the world, with the commemoration of of his own authority and power. And then let him rest a little, looking about him, to see if any spirit do appear; which if he delay, then let him repeat his invocation, as abovesaid, until he hath done it three times; and if the spirit be pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, obstinate, and will not appear, then let him begin to conjure him with divine power; so also that the conjurations and all his comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morations do agree with the nature and offices of the spirit himself; and reiterate the same three times, from stronger to stronger, using objurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, contumelies, cursings, and punishments, and suspension from his office and power, and the like.</p>
            <p>And after all the courses are finished, then cease a little; and if any spirit shall appear, let the invocant turn himself towards the spirit and courteously receive him, &amp; earnestly intreating him, let him require his name: and then proceeding
further,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108393:58"/>
let him ask him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>hatsoever he will: and if in any thing the spirit shall shew himself obstinate or lying, let him be bound by convenient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurations: and if you doubt of any lye, make without the circle with the consecrated sword, the figure of a triangle or <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>A Character with five Corners.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Pentagone,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the spirit to enter into it: and if thou receivest any promise which thou wouldest have to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with an oath, let him stretch the sword out of the circle, and swear the spirit, by laying his hand upon the sword. Then having obt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ined of the spirit that which you desire, or are otherwise contented, license him to depart with courteous words, giving command unto him, that he do no hurt: and if he will not depart, compel him by powerful conjurations; and if need require, expel him by exorcisms, and by making contrary fumigations. And when he is departed, go not out of the circle, but make a stay, making pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and giving of thanks unto God and the good Angels, and also praying for your defence and conservation; and then all those things being orderly performed, you may depart.</p>
            <p>But if your hopes are frustrated, and no spirit will appear, yet for this do not despair; but leaving the circle, return again at other times, doing as before. And if you shall judge that you have erred in any thing, then you shall amend by adding or demishing; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:108393:58"/>
of reiteration doth often increase your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and power, and striketh terror into the spirits, and humbleth them to obey.</p>
            <p>And therefore some use to make a gate in the circle, whereby they go in and out, which they open and shut as they please, and fortify it with holy names and pentacles.</p>
            <p>This also we are to take notice of, that when no spirits will appear, but the Master being wearied hath determined to cease and give over; let him not therefore depart without licensing the spirits: for they that do negl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ct this, are very greatly in danger, except they are fortified with some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime defence.</p>
            <p>Oftentimes also the spirits do come, although they appear not visible, (for to cause terror to him that calls them) either in the thing which he useth<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> or in the operation it self. But this kind of licensing is not given simply, but by a kind of dispensation with suspension, until in the following terms they shall render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves obedient. Also without a Circle these spirits may be called to appear according to the way which is above delivered about the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a book.</p>
            <p>But when we intend to execute any effect by evil spirits, where an apparition is not needful; then that is to be done, by making and forming that which is to be unto us an instrument, or subject of the experiment itself; as whether it be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:108393:59"/>
an image, or a ring, or a writing, or any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, candle, or sacrifice, or any thing of the like sort; then the name of the spirit is to be wirtten therein, with his character, according to the exigency of the experiment, either by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with some blood, or otherwise using a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume agreeable to the spirit. Oftentimes also making prayer and orations to God and the good Angels before we invocate the evil spirit, conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by the divine power.</p>
            <p>There is another kind of spirits which we have spoken of in our third book of occult philosophy, not so hurtful, and nearest to men; so also, that they are affected with human passions, and do joy in the conversation of men, and freely do inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit with them: and others do dwell in the woods and Desarts; and others delight in the company of divers domestics, animals and wild beasts: and othersome do inhabit about fountains and meadows. Whosoever therefore would call up these kind of spirits, in the place where they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, it ought to be done with odoriferous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, and with sweet sounds and instruments of music, specially composed for the business, with using of songs, inchantments and pleasant verses, with praises and promises.</p>
            <p>But those that are obstinate to yield to these things are to be compelled with threatnings, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, cursings, delusions, contumelies,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108393:59"/>
and especially by threatning them to expel them from those places where they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant.</p>
            <p>Further, if need be, thou mayest betake thee to use Exorcisms; but the chiefest thing that ought to be observed, is, constancy of mind, and boldness, free and alienated form fear.</p>
            <p>Lastly, when you would invocate these kind of spirits, you ought to prepare a table in the place of invocation, covered with clean linen; whereupon you shall set new bread, and running water or milk in new earthen vessels, and new knives. And you shall make a fire, whereupon a perfume shall be made. But let the invocant go unto the head of the table, and round about it let there be seats placed for the spirits, as you please; and the spirits being called, you shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite them to drink and eat. But if perchance you shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ear any evil spirit, then draw a circle about it, and let that part of the table at which the invocant sits, be within the circle, and the rest of the table without the circle.</p>
            <p>In our third <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ook of Occult Philosophy, we have taught how and by what means the soul is joined to the body; and, what happeneh to the soul after death.</p>
            <p>Thou mayest know further, that those souls do still love their relinquished bodies after death, as it were a certain affin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ty alluring them; such as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108393:60"/>
are the souls of noxious men, which have violently relinquished their bodies, and souls wanting a due burial, which do still wander in a liquid and turbulent spirits about their dead carcasses; for these souls by the known means by which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they were conjoined to their bodies, by the like vapours, liquors, and favours, are easily drawn unto them.</p>
            <p>From hence it is, that the souls of the dead are not to be called up without blood, or by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of some part of their relict body.</p>
            <p>In the raising up of these shadows, we are to perfume with new blood, with the bones of the dead, and with Flesh, Eggs, Milk, Honey and Oil, and such like things, which do attribute to the souls a means apt to receive their bodies.</p>
            <p>It is also to be understood, those who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to raise up any souls of the dead, they ought to do it in those places, wherein these kind of souls are most known to be conversant; or for some alliance alluring those souls into their forsaken body; or some kind of affection in times past, impressed in them in their life, drawing the said souls to certain places, things, or persons; or for the forcible nature of some place fitted and prepared for to purge or punish these souls. Which places for the most part are to be known by the experience of visions, nightly incursions, and apparitions, and such like prodigies seen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:108393:60"/>Therefore the places most fitting for these things, are Church-yards. And better than them, are those places wherein there is the execution of criminal judgments. And better than these, are those places, in which of late years there have been some public slaughters of men. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, that place is better than these, where some dead carcass, that came by violent death, is not yet expiated, nor lately buried, and was lately buried; for the expiation of those places, is also a holy rite duly to be adhibited to the burial of the bodies, and oftentimes prohibiteth the souls to come unto their bodies, and expelleth them far off unto the places of judgment.</p>
            <p>And from hence it is, that the souls of the dead are not easily to be raised up, except it be the souls of them whom we know to be evil, or to have perished by a violent death, and whose bodies do want a rite and due burial.</p>
            <p>Now although we have spoken concerning such places of this kind, it will not be safe or commodious to go unto them, but it behoveth us to take to what place soever is to be chosen, some principal part of the body that is relict, and therewith to make perfume in due manner, and to perform other competent rites.</p>

            <p>Moreover, these things which are now spoken of, are not always sufficient to raise up souls, because of an extranatural portion of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and reason, which is above, and known only to the heaven and destinies, and their powers.</p>
            <p>We ought therefore to allure the said souls, by supernatural and coelestial powers duely admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistered, even by those things which do m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former book, which is the fourth book of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently spoken concerning Magical ceremonies, and Initiations.</p>
            <p>But because he seemeth to have written to the 1earned, and well experienced in this art; because he doth not specially treat of the ceremonies, but rather speaking of them in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, it was therefore thought good to add here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the magical elements of <hi>Peter de Abano:</hi> that those who are hitherto ignorant, and have not tasted of magical superstitions, may have them in readiness, how they may exercise themselves therein. For we see in this book, as it were a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108393:62"/>
certain introduction of magical vanity; and as it were in present exercise, they may behold the distinct functions of spirits, how they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In brief, in this book are kept the principles of magical conveyances. But because the greatest power is attributed to the Circles; (For they are certain fortresses to defend the operators safe from the evil spirits;) in the first place we will treat concerning the composition of a Circle.</p>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Of the Circle, and the composition thereof.</head>
               <p>THE form of Circles is not always one and the same; but useth to be changed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of the spirits that are to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, their places, times, days and hours. For in making a circle, it ought to be considered in what time of the year, what day, and what hour, that you make the circle; what spirits you would call, to what star and region they do belong, and what functions they have. Therefore let there be made three circles of the latitude of nine foot, and let them be distant one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a hands breadth; and in the middle circle, first, write the name of the hour wherein you do the work. In the second place, write the name of the Angel of the hour. In the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108393:62"/>
third place, the Sigil of the Angel of the hour. Fourthly, the name of the Angel that ruleth that day wherein you do the work, and the names of his ministers. In the fifth place, the name of the present time. Sixthly, the name of the spirits ruling in that part of time, and their Presidents. Seventhly, the name of the head of the sign ruling in that part of time wherein you work. Eightly, the name of the earth, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that part of time wherein you work. Ninthly, and for the completing of the middle circle, write the name of the sun and of the moon, according to the said rule of time; for as the time is changed, so the names are to be altered. And in the outermost circle, let there be drawn in the four angles, the names of the presidential Angels of the air, that day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you would do this work; to wit, the name of the King and his three ministers. Without the Circle, in four Angles, let <hi>Pentagones</hi> be made. In the inner circle let there be written four di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine names with crosses interposed in the middle of the circle; to wit, towards the East let there be written <hi>Alpha,</hi> and towards the West let there be writt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT is also to be known, that the Angels do rule the hours in a successive order, according to the course of the heavens, and planets unto which they are subject; so that that spirit which governeth the day ruleth also the first hour of the day; the second from this governeth the second hour; the third, the third hour, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently: and when seven planets and hours have made there revolution, it returneth again to the first which ruleth the day.

Wherefore I bind you, that you remain affable and visible before this circle, so long and so constant; neither shall ye depart without my licence, until you have truely and without any fallacy performed my will, by virtue of his power, who hath set the sea her bounds, beyond which these cannot pass, nor go beyond the law of his power, to wit, of the most high God, Lord and King, who hath created all things, Amen. ‚Ä† In the name of the Father, ‚Ä† and of the Son, ‚Ä† and

                  <p>The Spirits of the Air of Saturday are subject to the South-west-wind: the nature of them is is to sow discords, hatred, evil thoughts and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations; to give leave freely to slay and kill every one, and to lame or maim every member. Their manner of appearing is declared in the former book.</p>

            <p>In a Discourse between CASTOR and POLLUX.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>THE <hi>Greeks</hi> do report, that <hi>Castor and Pollux have both proceeded from one Egg</hi>; but this I scarcely credit, by reason of the difference of your minds; for thou affectest the heavens, but she meditates upon the earth and slaughters.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>And from thence perhaps was derived that argument, <hi>That liberty of lying was always assigned to the Greeks.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>Principally.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:108393:88"/>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>But it is not to be supposed that the <hi>Greeks</hi> are vain in all things; but as many others, when they speak out of a three-footed thing; whereof also the Poet <hi>Ovid</hi> speaks in verse,
<q>‚Äî Nec singunt omnia Graeci.</q>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>In this proverb I protest they are most true, without any exception, that is, <hi>one Man to another is a Devil.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>Wherefore believest thou this to be most true, <hi>Castor?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>Truly, that man to man is a devil and a ravening wolf, daily events do most certainly prove, if we do but note the treacheries that one man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents daily against another, the roberies, thefts, plunderings, rapes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> slaughters, deceits, adulteries, and an hundred vipers of this nature; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers persecutes the son, with a serpentine and poisonous biting; one friend seeks to devour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, neither can the guest be safe with his host.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>I confess it is truth thou speakest; but for ought I hear, thou dost misunderstand the Etymology of the word compared in this Proverb; for <hi>Daemon</hi> here it is not an horrible or odious name, but the name of one that doth administer help or succour unto another, and whom <hi>Pliny</hi> calls a God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:108393:88"/>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore dost thou affirm the word <hi>Daemon</hi> in this Proverb to signify any other than a cunning and malicious accuser?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>Thou hast not shot besides the mark: for, that there are more <hi>Daemons</hi> than that sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary one which thou understandest, every one may easily perceive; who hath not negligently read the opinions of the most excellent <hi>Plato.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>I desire therefore, that thou wouldst not conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>l such his writings; but that I may apprehend the marrow thereof.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>I will embrace such thy desire, for truly I do delight to treat with thee concerning this subject; mark therefore and give attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> divided the order of Devils or Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three degrees, which as they are distinct in the greatness of their dignity, so also they are different in the distance and holding of their places. And the first order he ascribeth to those spirits whose bodies are nourished of the most pure element of air, wrought and joined together, in a manner, as it were with splended threads, not having so much reference to the element of fire, that they may be perspicuous to the sight; neither do they so much participate of the earth, that they may be touched or felt; and they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the Coelestial theatre attending and waiting on their Prince, not to be declared by any human tongue, or beyond the commands of the most wise God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:108393:89"/>But the other degree is derived from those Spirits which <hi>Apuleius</hi> termeth rational animals, passive in their mind, and eternal in their time, understanding the apostate spirits spread abroad from the bounds and borders of the Moon, unto us under the dominion of their Prince <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> which before the fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> had pure clarified bodies; and now, like unto the former, do wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up and down, after their transgression, in the form of an airy quallity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>These I do not conceive are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the <hi>Greek</hi> Proverb: for these do hurt, and are the accusers and betrayers of men, But proceed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>The third degree of spirits is of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine deity, which is called by <hi>Hermes,</hi> a divine miracle to man, if he do not degenerate from the Kingly habit of his first form; whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this kind the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> have called <hi>Daemons,</hi> that is, God; and that man may be like unto God, and profitable and commodious one to another; and so also (the <hi>Syrian</hi> being witness) we have known <hi>Plato</hi> himself to have been called <hi>Daemon,</hi> because he had set forth very many things of very high matters, for the good of the commmon wealth; and so likewise <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> because he very largely disputed of subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and all such things as are subject to motion and sense. <hi>Homer</hi> calleth good and evil Spirits, <hi>Daemons,</hi> without putting a discrimination.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:108393:89"/>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>Thou hast committed the ship to the waves <hi>Pollux</hi>; therefore cease not to proceed, and declare something more concerning the Office and imployment of these Spirits, to whom <hi>Plato</hi> attributeth the second degree, and calleth them Lunaries.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>What shall I say?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>In the first place, declare wherefore thou hast before termed these spirits cunning and much knowing accusers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>St. <hi>Augustine</hi> unfoldeth this difficulty, and saith, that <hi>a Devil doth so far signify the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and much knowing quickness and vivacity of his deceitful wit, that by the congruent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able seminal mixture of elements, he doth so know the secret and unknown virtues of men, as those things which may be effected and wrought by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves successively and leisurely according to the course of nature, he by a speedy hasting or forcing of the works of nature, or by his own art, sooner bringeth the same to pass.</hi> An example hereof he giveth in the wise men of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> who immediately brought forth frogs and serpents at the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King, which nature more slowly and leisurely procreateth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>Thou hast excellently answered to the question, <hi>Pollux</hi>; but add something concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the original of those Spirits which do resist and refuse virtue; for oftentimes doubting, I
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:108393:90"/>
have been persuaded that such Erynnes as are from God, do not appear out of the earth.</p>

               <p>The Ecclesiastical Scripture every where maketh mention of the rising of them; but I will unfold such a doubt: and there do arise many and various opinions of writers, but more commonly <hi>Peter Lombardus</hi> in his book of Sentences, draweth his Allegations out of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> upon <hi>Genesis</hi>; to wit, that <hi>the Devil was before his fall an Archangel, and had a fine tender body, composed by God, out of the serenity and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest matter of the sky and air, but then after his fall from an Archangel, he was made an Apostate, and his body no more fine and subtil; but his body was made that it might suffer the effect of a more gross substance, from the quality of the more obscure, dark, and spissious air, which body also was stricken and astonished with the raging madness of pride, did draw away very many which were then Angels with him into his service and bondage, that they might be made Devils, who in this troublesome world do exercise their servile courses for him, and they do compel the inhabitants therein, or rather entice them; and to this purpose they undertake va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious endeavours, and do attempt various and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold horrible studies, that are abominable unto God, and they serve in slavery and thraldom to</hi> Beelzebub <hi>their Prince, and are held in most strong captivity.</hi>

               <p>He could: but being allured by that pride, which made him so arrogantly affect the Majesty of God, he did so far strive to be like unto God, that he chose very many Ministers, unto himself, to which in general he doth not commit all things he would have effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but divers things to divers Ministers, as may be gathered from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Astronomers.

               <p>And many more; for the same <hi>Hebrew</hi> Assertors do declare and maintain, that there are are spirits of the fiery element, raging about like the fierce Panthers, which are conversant under the lunary regions, that whatsoever is

committed to them, they forthwith execute the same. And there are spirits of the earth, which inhabit in groves, woods and wildernesses, and are the plague and mischief of hunters; and sometimes they frequent open fields, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to seduce travellers and passengers out of their right way, or to deceive them with false and wicked illusions; or else they seek to afflict men with a hurtful melancholy, to make them furious or mad, that they may hurt them, and sometimes almost kill them. The chief of these are <hi>Sanyaab</hi> and <hi>Achimael,</hi> which are oriental spirits, a kind unapt for wickedness, by reason of the constancy of their dispositions. There are also subterranean spirits which do inhabit in dens and caverns of the earth, and in remote concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mountains, that they might invade deep pits, and the bowels of the earth; these do dig up metals, and keep treasures, which oftentimes they do transport from one place to another, lest any man should make use thereof: they stir up winds with flashing flames of fires: they smite the foundations of buildings, acting frightful dances in the night, from which they suddenly vanish away, with making a noise and sound of bells, thereby causing fear in the beholders; and sometimes dissembling, and faining themselves to be the souls of the dead: notwithstanding they are ignorant in compassing their deceits upon

               <p>A man never walketh safely, unless he fortify and strengthen himself with the armour of God, which is, that his loins be girt about him with truth, and having on the breast-plate of righteousness, let him walk with his feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, and let him take the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation, whereby he shall dash in pieces all the darts of his adversaries. But hear further: there are also besides these, other lying spirits (although they are all lyars) yet these are more apt to lie; they are called <hi>Pythons,</hi> from whence <hi>Apollo</hi> is called <hi>Pythius.</hi> They have a Prince, of whom mention is made in the book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> where it is said, <hi>I will be a lying Spirit in the mouth of all thy prophets</hi>; from whom the spirits of iniquity do but a little differ, which also are called vessels of wrath. <hi>Belial,</hi> whom they have interpreted to be without any equal, and <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him an apostate or trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor, is filthily inserviant for the worst inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth <hi>Theut</hi> to have have been such a one, who was the first that found out and invented plays and dice: to whom we will join the Monk, who invented the use of Gunpowder,

in his Engins of war. Of these <hi>Jacob</hi> makes mention in <hi>Genesis.</hi> where he blessed his Sons: he saith, <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> are bloody vessels of iniquity; Oh my soul, come not thou into their counsels.

               <p>The story is something long and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixious, yet it shall not much trouble me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it. It is thus: <hi>Pliny</hi> in the seventh book of his <hi>Epistles</hi> writeth, of a certain large spacious house at <hi>Athens,</hi> which no body would inhabit by reason of the nocturnal incursions of spirits, which were so formidable to the inhabitants, that sometimes in the day-time, and when they were watching, they would cast them into dreams, so always, that the shapes and forms which they then saw, were ever present in their memory. Where at length a certain Philosopher named <hi>Anthenodorus</hi> happened to purchase that house, and prepared and furnished the same for himself to dwell in; and because all men had an evil sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of that house, he forthwith commanded his servants to provide him a bed and tables, that after he had completed and finished his study he might go to bed. He therefore (saith <hi>Pliny</hi>) when he went in (in the evening) and applied himself to his study, suddenly heard the locks to shake open, and the chains to be moved; nevertheless he did not lift up his eyes, nor stirred from his book, but stopped his ears with his fingers, lest that furious tumult might work a vain fear upon him; but the noise still approaching nearer unto him, at length he looked up, and saw an effiges like unto a finger beckening and calling unto him;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:108393:95"/>
which he little regarded, until it had touched him three times, and the noise drew near unto the table; and then he looked up, and took a light, beheld the spirit, as it were an old man worn away with withered leaness and deformity, his beard hanging down long, horrible and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed hair, his legs and feet were as it were laden with chains and fetters: he went towards a gate which was bolted, and there left the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, and vanished away.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>The next day he related the whole matter to the Magistrates in order, as he had seen the same, admonishing them that they should dig diligently about the threshold of the door; for there it was probable they might find something, which might cause the house to be quiet and habitable.</p>

               <p>Having digged up the earth, <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, they found a dead carcase, bound and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in chains and fetters, his flesh being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed with devouring time, which without delay they caused to be buried, according to the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ceremonies.</p>

            <sp>

                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> speaking of miracles, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth a certain mountain in <hi>Norway,</hi> named <hi>Hechelberg,</hi> environed about with the Sea, that continually sent forth such lamentable voices, like the yelling and howling of infernal devils, insomuch that the noise and clamour of their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible roaring might be heard almost a mile; and the flocking together of great ravens and vultures near it, did prohibit any access thereunto. And he reported that in <hi>Lyppora</hi> near about the <hi>Aeolian</hi> Islands, there was a certain hill from whence in the night there was heard Cymbals, and sounds of tinkling instruments of brass, with certain secret and hidden screechings, laughings and roarings of spirits.

And at length <hi>Ericus</hi> the King of <hi>Succia</hi> came into that place with an Army, and broke open the tomb of <hi>Asuitus</hi>; (supposing their had been treasure hid therein) but when the cave was opened, he drew out <hi>Asmundus.</hi> and brought him into the light, who was covered with a deformed sharp countenance, a deadly deformity, and gored with blood flowing from his fresh wounds.</p>

                  </gap>er doth also report the same; and he also teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That sometimes they sleep or rest, and do change their places, and shew themselves visible to the senses of men. <hi>Socrates</hi> asserteth, that a Spirit did speak with him, which also sometimes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108393:99"/>
he saw and felt; but their bodies cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to be different in sex. But <hi>Marcus Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronesus,</hi> an excellent searcher into the natures of Spirits, writeth, that they have simple bodies and that there doth belong a difference of sex to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound bodies: yet their bodies are easily drawn to motion and flexibility, and naturally apt to receive every configuration. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>even as the clouds do shew forth the apparition and resemblance sometimes of men, and sometimes of every thing you conceive; so likewise do the bodies of Spirits receive various shapes, as they please, by reason whereof they transform themselves into the forms sometimes of men, and sometimes of women. Nevertheless this is not free to them all, but only to the fiery and airy Spirits.</hi> For he teacheth, that the Spirits of the water have more slow and less active bodies, which by reason of the slowness and softness of that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they do most especially resemble birds and women; of which kind the <hi>Naiades</hi> and <hi>Nereides</hi> are, celebrated by the Poets. <hi>Trimetius</hi> testifies, that <hi>the Devils do desire to assume the shapes of men rather than any other form; but when they cannot find the matter of the air convenient and befitting for that purpose.</hi> And he saith, that <hi>they frame such kind of appearances to themselves. as the contrary humour or vapour will afford; and so they are seen sometimes in the form and shape of a Lion, a Wolf, a Sow, an Ass, a Centaure, of a Man horned, having feet like a Goat:</hi> such as it is reported were seen

as an Ox desireth hay, so he with the teeth of his suggestions, coveteth to destroy the upright lives of spiritual men.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>It had been more safe for every man
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108393:101"/>
to have been without the evil spirits; what therefore was the will of the heavenly Father concerning them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>That by the assistance of the good spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, we might courageously wage continual war against the evil spirits; but being cloathed with the harness of righteousness, like valiant Soldiers we may gird our loins with truth, and with the shield of faith resist and fight against all his darts.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>If we condescend unto this warfare of Spirits, it seemeth good to enquire whether the Devils have power of doing hurt, granted them by God; or whether of themselves they can hurt as much as they please?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>If the last where true, who could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the end of their hurtings? but it is manifest, that their authority from on high is of so great existancy, that <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist doubteth not to name the Devils the princes of the earth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>In what manner therefore do they hurt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>Although they be most mighty and powerful spirits, yet they can do no hurt unless it be by permission; or as <hi>Damacenus</hi> saith, <hi>by dispensation.</hi> And <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, <hi>they have a limited power; for truely without the will of God, they cannot touch a hair of any mans head.</hi> The Devil could not have deceived the Prophets of <hi>Ahab,</hi> if he had not received power from God; neither could he have brought any detriment upon <hi>Job,</hi> either unto his body or his goods, but by the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:108393:101"/>
power God had given him. In the 7 of <hi>Exodus</hi> the Magicians made frogs and serpents by the power of the Devil permissively: but lice they could not bring forth, by reason of the greater power of God prohibiting them, Neither in the Gospel could the Devils hurt the swine until Christ had given them leave.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore the Devil is not so much to be feared, but the Lord our God, that either he would not suffer him to rage against us; or if at any time by his own determinate counsel he let loose his chains, that then he would defend and mercifully preserve us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pollux.</speaker>
               <p>Thou sayest well; for even as a wild boar is not to be feared if he be bound, and held with a strong chain by a powerful strong man, &amp; who is able by his strength to restrain the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the boar; but the man is to be feared, and requested, that he would not let loose the boar: so also <hi>Satan</hi> is not to be feared, being bound with the cords of the Almighty; but the Almighty rather, who holdeth him with a cord, lest at any time he should let loose his cord, for to execute his will against us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Castor.</speaker>
               <p>We know that the Devils, after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the word, were called the Lords of the earth; but I wonder, where the word is not yet incarnate, whether they have power also over men.</p>

the spirits have a body without hands or feet; wherefore they can hurt no man, nor make any tumult: being ignorant that the Angel (who also hath a body without hands and feet) did carry <hi>Habakkuk</hi> with his whole dinner, by the hair of his head, into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and afterwards brought him back again, and set him in his own place: neither considering that the spirit of the Lord, also without a body, snatched up <hi>Philip,</hi> and carried him to <hi>Azotus</hi>: that I may forbear to speak concerning a certain incorporeal spirit, which did so disquiet the house of my grandfather, that by the space of almost thirty years he caused it to be uninhabitable, unless it were when a lamp was burning therein; neither did that then sufficiently quiet the same: for going out of the house, they did so molest them with stones from above in the streets, that the would cast out of their hands the hearts of Pine-trees, which they used for torches.

               <p>In his 11 book, which he intitleth <hi>De mortuorum cura,</hi> he offereth them as a means, saying, <hi>Human infirmaty doth so believe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that when he seeth any one that is dead, in his sleep, he supposeth that he seeth the soul of that dead person; but when he dreameth of any one that is alive, he then is out of doubt, that neither
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:108393:111"/>
his soul nor his body, but the similitude of the man appeared unto him: as if they could be ignorant, that the souls of dead men do not appear unto them in dreams, but only the similitudes of the persons deceased.</hi> And he proveth both these to be done, by two examples which were as <hi>Mediolanus</hi>; whereof the first he sheweth to have been the image of a certain father that was dead, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to his son, admonishing him that he should not pay again a debt to an unjust creditor, which the father had paid him before: for he saith the case was thus: the father had paid a debt to a certain creditor, which after the death of the father, the creditor endeavoured by force to recover the same again of his son, who was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the payment thereof: to whom the image of his father appeared when he was sleeping, and shewed him where the writing was hid. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the son awaking from his sleep, sought for the paper in the place he was directed, and found it, and thereby overthrew the malice of his deceitful creditor. The second example is, whereby the same St. <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth that the living do appear to the living, in their sleep: for he saith, that <hi>Eurologius</hi> the Rhetorician, professing the Rhetorick of <hi>Cicero</hi> at <hi>Carthage,</hi> he found a difficult and obscure place that was not declared unto him; so that waking and sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he vexed himself by reason of his ignorance;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108393:112"/>
but, in a certain night, the image of <hi>Aurelius Augustine</hi> appeared to him, and taught him in what manner the dark and difficult place was to be understood.</p>

               <p>He doth so conclude: and the greater to strengthen such his judgment, he addeth, that if the souls of the dead have any interest or council in the affairs of the living, he undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly knew, that his own pious mother did not desert him not for one night, but when she was living, followed him both by sea and land: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he at any time sustain any anguish of heart but comforted his sorrows. And that this may not seem too hard a speech, the presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Christ teacheth, that they do not err, who affirm that the good Angels, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and divine dispensation, do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come to, and visit men, both living and sleeping, and sometimes to the place where souls endure punishment: notwithstanding, it is not unto all, but only unto those who have so lived, that God shall judge them worthy of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: or unto those upon whom, without any respect unto their deserts, God will be pleased to glorify his unspeakable mercy; that by the prayers of the living they may obtain pardon of their sins, and deliverance from the prison of torments.</p>

            <head>GERARD CREMONENSIS:
OF
ASTRONOMICAL GEOMANCY.</head>
            <p>BEcause Astronomy is so transendant and subtil an art in itself, that therein a man ought to have respect unto so many things before he can attain to true judgment thereby, because the eye of the understanding will not pierce unto the half thereof, and few Doctors of our latter time have been found so experienced therein, that they know sufficiently how to judge thereby; therefore I have composed this work, which I will have to be named <hi>Astronomical Geomancy</hi>; wherein, I will sufficiently teach how to judge with less labour and study. For in this present science it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to behold neither the Ascendant, nor the hour in a Table, as it is in Astrology.</p>
            <p>It is expedient therefore to make four unequal lines, by the points casually set down; and to join together those points; and out of the points which are not joined together, which do remain in the heads of the lines, (as it is done in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy) extract one figure; and the sign of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> that answereth to the figure, put for the Ascendant, for the words sake. If <hi>Acquisitio</hi> arise
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:108393:115"/>
from the heads of those four lines, let <hi>Aries</hi> be placed in the Ascendant; if <hi>Laetitia,</hi> or the lesser Fortune put <hi>Taurus</hi> in the Ascendant; if <hi>Puer</hi> or <hi>Rubeus,</hi> place <hi>Gemini</hi>; if <hi>Albus, Cancer;</hi> if <hi>Via, Leo</hi>; if <hi>Conjunctio</hi> or the <hi>Dragons head, Virgo</hi>; if <hi>Puella, Libra</hi>; if <hi>Amissio</hi> or <hi>Tristitia, Scorpio</hi>; if the <hi>Dragons Tail, Sagittary</hi>; if <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus, Capricorn</hi>; if <hi>Fortuna major, Aquary</hi>; if <hi>Carcer,</hi> then put <hi>Pisces</hi> for the Ascendant. Afterwards in the second house, let that sign be placed which immediately succeeds the other. In the third house, the third sign, and so place the rest in order until you come unto the end of the signs; and make one square figure divided into twelve equal parts, and therein place the signs in order, as it is in Astrology, &amp; as you may find them in this figure: neither are we here to regard the witnesses, or Judge, or any other thing which belongs to Geomancy; but only the sixteen figures, that by them we may have the twelve signs, to which they agree; and observe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the figure as it is here placed.</p>
            <p>

               <figure>
                  <head>Look how the twelve Signs are placed in the figure, and so may any other Sign be ascending in his turn, as <hi>Aries</hi> is here.</head>
               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards it is requisite to make four lines by course for every Planet, by points casually pricked down; and likewise for the <hi>Dragons Head,</hi> as you have done for the Ascendant, and divide those points by twelve, and that which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth above twelve, or the twelfth itself, if a greater number doth not remain, retain, and the Planet for which the projection was made, place in that house of which the superabounding number shall be; that is, if there remain twelve,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:108393:116"/>
let the Planet be placed in the twelfth house; if ten, in the tenth house; if one, in the first house; if two, in the second house; and so of the rest. And you ought always to begin from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and afterwards from the <hi>Moon,</hi> then from <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> and from <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if the Lord of the second be in his fall, it will never be found; but if he be exalted, it shall be found very well: but the seventh house sheweth the thief.</p>

                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:108393:123"/>But if you would know what it is that is stolen, behold the Lord of the second; which if he be <hi>Saturn,</hi> it is lead, iron, a kettle, a trivet, a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or some black thing, or leather. If he be <hi>Jupiter,</hi> then it is some white thing, as tin, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or mixt with white and yellow veins.

               <p>If you would know whether the thief do yet remain in the Town: if they be in succedent houses, he is not gone far off; but if they be in cadent houses, he is far remote.</p>
               <p>If you desire to know towards what Country the thief is fled, see in what sign the Lord of the seventh is; for if he be in <hi>Aries,</hi> he is in the middle of the East part. if in <hi>Taurus,</hi> in the South towards the East.

               <p>If you would know whether the thief hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all the things stolen away with him, see the Lord of the seventh and the eighth; and if the Lord of the seventh be in an Angle, he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to carry away the same with him, but could not. If the Lord of the eighth be in a mean house, or in a cadent house, and the Lord of the second in a strong house, he hath carried the theft wholly with him. And if the Lord of the seventh and the eighth be both in cadent houses, he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carried it away, nor hath it. See by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth who is his companion, and what is his gain.</p>
               <p>If you would know the descent or nobility of a man or woman, look unto the Lord of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth; which if you find him in Angles, and the Lord of the first in succedents or cadents, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is more noble than the man.

               <p>If you desire to know whether an intended mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage shall take effect, or not, look to the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and his Lord, and the <hi>Moon,</hi> for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and the seventh house, and his Lord, for the woman. And if the Lord of the Ascendant or the <hi>Moon</hi> be joined to the Lord of the seventh, or be in the seventh, the marriage will be effected; or if the Lord of the seventh be in the first, or with the Lord of the first, it will easily be brought to pass; and the woman be more desirous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, than the man.</p>
               <p>If you would know whether thy wife or friend hath any other lover or not, look if <hi>Mars</hi> be in the seventh, so that he be not in his own house, for then she hath not any other lover. And if <hi>Saturn</hi> be there, she loveth another; but he lieth not with her. And if the <hi>Dragons Tail</hi> be in the seventh, he lieth with her. And if <hi>Jupiter</hi> be there, she hardly containeth herself chaste. If <hi>Venus,</hi> she is merry, and much given to play and laughter, by reason whereof, she may be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a whore, and is not so. If <hi>Mercury</hi> be in the seventh, she had a lover, but now hath none. But if the <hi>Moon</hi> be in the seventh, she hath had no lover as yet, but will have one, and will be common. But if the <hi>Sun</hi> or the <hi>Dragons Head</hi> be there, she is chaste. And after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may you judge in the *ninth* concerning friends or lovers.</p>

               <p>If you desire to make a society or alliance, and would know whether it shall be brought to pass or not, or what shall happen thereupon, see if there be good Planets in the seventh and the first: and if so, the fellowship will be made, and good will come thereof; and you may judge it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so many years, months or days, as the Lord of the seventh hath signification of.</p>
               <p>If you would know when such society shall be, look what Planet is in the seventh; for if he be good, it shall come to pass that same year: or wedlock, *R* if the Question be thereof.</p>
               <p>If you would know whether they will well agree, see the first and his Lord, which is the signifier of the Querent; and the seventh house &amp; his Lord, which is the house of companions, wives, and concubines; which if they be concordant amongst themselves, there will be peace and union between them, and they shall profit; but if the Planets be in discord, there will be strife between them, and the society will not profit.</p>

Or otherwise, and which is better, see the second and his Lord, and the eighth and his Lord; and in which house is the better Planet, or his Lord that shall be found in the better place, or joined with the better Planets, he shall be the greater gainer. The second House of his Lord signifies the gain of the Querent: and the eighth house and his Lord signifies the gain of his fellow, or his part: and if they be both good, they shall both gain; and if both evil, they shall both lose; and if one be good and the other evil, he whose significator is good, shall gain; and he whose is evil, shall lose.</p>
               <p>And if you would know if two fellows shall love one another, look if the Lords of the first &amp; the seventh be friends, and agreeing, then they will love one another; but if they be enemies &amp; disagree, then they will not.</p>
               <p>If you desire to know who shall overcome in any cause, matter or controversie, behold the Lords of the first and the seventh, which if they be in Angles, neither of them shall overcome; and see which of them is joined with an evil Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the other weak, and the Planet which is in the strong house do not fall, nor hath not an evil Planet with him; and if he which is weak be not in his own house, nor in his exaltation, nor with a good Planet, he whose Planet is in the strong house, shall overcome; likewise he whose significator is in a mean house, shall have great fear and doubt in his heart, because sometimes he shall hope to conquer, and otherwhiles fear to be overcome, And note, that in a question concerning war and kingdom, it is said that there is more power and efficacy, or fortitude in the exaltation of a Planet, than in his house; but in all other Questions the contrary.</p>
               <p>If you would be informed concerning any one being, that is gone to any fight, whether he shall return safe, see the Lord of the Ascendant; if he be good, that is, with good Planets, and a good Planet in the first, he will return safe, but if the <hi>Sun</hi> be with the Lord of the first, in any part of the Question, let him not go, because the <hi>Sun</hi> burneth him. And if the Lord of the seventh be with a good Planet, and the Lord of the first with a good Planet, likewise, he shall have some impediment in the way; but he will not die. And if an evil Planet be with the Lord of the first, and a good Planet in the first, if he goeth he shall suffer great damage, but not death; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless he may be grievously wounded. And if <hi>Saturn</hi> be in the first, or with the Lord of the

And if there be an evil Planet with the Lord of the first, or <hi>Saturn</hi> be in the first, or with the Lord of the first, he will be wounded with wood or with a stone. If <hi>Mars</hi> and the <hi>Dragons Tail</hi> be in the first, or with the Lord of the first; or if there be evil Planets in the first, or with the Lord of the first, he will suffer wounds or death.

And if the <hi>Sun</hi> be with the Lord of the seventh, or in the eighth, it signifies that it is ill to go. The like judgment is of the seventh and the tenth.</p>
               <p>And if a Question be proposed concerning the event of war, see the seventh and the first, and their Lords: for the first house and his Lord sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Querent; in the seventh and his Lord the adversary. So that if there be good Planets in the first, and evil in the seventh; and if the Lord of the first and seventh be evil, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent shall overcome: but if there be an evil Planet with the Lord of the first, and an evil Planet in the first, and the Lord of the seventh good, or *R.* in the seventh, the Querent shall be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or taken, or slain. And if the Lords of them both be in the first, and there be good Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets from the part of the first house, unto the end of the house, which is the middle of the Question; and if evil Planets do possess the other
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:108393:126"/>
half of the Question, that is to say, from the seventh unto the end of the twelfth house, the adversary shall overcome. But if both the Lords be in the Ascendant, and if they be good from the part of the first, and evil from the part of the seventh, they shall both suffer great loss; but the Querent shall have the better in the end. But if the Lord of the Ascendant be in the seventh, or in his Question, it signifies fortitude of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary: and if the Lord of the seventh be in the first, or in his Question, it signifies fortitude of the actor. And if the Lord of the Ascendant be in the eighth, or with the Lord of the eighth; or the Lord of the eighth in the first, or with the Lord of the first, it signifies the death of the Querent. And if the Lord of the seventh be in the second, or with his Lord; or the Lord of the second in the seventh, or with the Lord of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, it signifies the death of the enemy.</p>
               <p>If you would know whether war shall continue long or not, if mean or meanly; if the Lords of the first and the seventh do agree, the parties shall be pacified after the war.</p>
               <p>If thou wouldest depart from the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou art, and remove thyself to some other place; and if thou wouldest know whether it be better for thee to stay or go: or concerning two businesses, if thou desirest to know which of them is most expedient for thee to undertake, consider the Lords of the first and the second, for those

places to which thou wouldest go, the place wherein thou art, and the gain which thou get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test there; and the seventh and the eighth, and their Lords, for the place to which thou wouldest go, and the gain which thou mayest get there: and those places chuse, whose Lords are the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or joined to the better Planets. Or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: behold the Lord of the Ascendant, and the <hi>Moon</hi>; which if they be seperated from evil Planets, and joined to good and fortunate Planets, it is better for thee to go from the places where thou art, than to stay there, and to do whatsoever business thou hast in thy mind. And if the Lord of the Ascendant and the <hi>Moon</hi> be seperated from the Fortunes, and joined to evil Planets, then it is not good for thee to remove thyself, nor to do thy business. Or thus: See the <hi>Moon</hi>; and if the the Planet from which she is seperated be better than that to whom she is joined, do not remove: and if the Planet which she is joined to, be better than that from which she is sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, then go.</p>

            <p>The fifth is Roman or Sibylline Magick, which acteth &amp; operates with tutelar spirits &amp; Lords, to whom the whole orb of the earth is distributed. This is <hi>valde insignis Magia.</hi> To this the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>Druids</hi> referred.</p>
            <p>The sixth is Pythagorical Magick, which only acteth with spirits to whom is given the doctrine of Arts, as Physic, Medicines, Mathematicks. Alchymy, and such kind of Arts.</p>
            <p>The seventh is the Magick of <hi>Appolonius,</hi> &amp; the like, &amp; agreeth with the Roman &amp; Microcosmical Magick: only it hath this thing peculiar, that it hath power over the hostile part of mankind.</p>
            <p>The eighth is Hermitical, that is Aegyptical Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick; &amp; differeth not much from divine Magick.</p>

                  <p>God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible, in the holy Scriptures proposeth himself to have an eye over us; and as a tender father which loveth his children, he teacheth us what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and what not; what we are to avoid, &amp; what we are to embrace: then he allureth us to obedience with great promises of corporal &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal benefits, and deterreth us (with threatning of punishments) from those things which are not profitable for us.

                  <p>Appoint therefore to him who solely dependeth upon God, the wisdom of every creature to serve and obey him, <hi>nolens volens,</hi> willing or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And in this, the omnipotency of God shineth forth. It consisteth therefore in this, that we will discern the creatures which serve us, from those that are unwilling; and that we may learn how to accommodate the wisdom and office of every creature unto ourselves. This art is not delivered, but divinely. Unto whom God will, he revealeth his secrets; but to whom he will not bestow any thing out of his treasuries, that person shall attain to nothing without the will of God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we ought truly to desire from God alone, which will mercifully impart these things unto us.

                     <item>5. A man that is a true Magician. is brought forth a Magician from his mothers womb: others, who do give themselves to this office, are unhappy.

                     </item>
                     <item>6. Every Character given from a spirit, for what cause soever, hath his efficacy in this business, for which it is given, in the time prefixed: but it is to be used the same day and Planetary hour wherein it is given.</item>
                     <item>7. God liveth, and thy soul liveth: keep thy Covenant, &amp; thou hast whatsoever the spirit shall reveal unto thee in God, because all things shall be done which the spirit promiseth unto thee.</item>

                     <hi>Olympus</hi> and the inhabitants thereof, do of their own accord offer themselves to men in the forms of spirits; and are ready to perform their offices for them, whether they will or not: by how much the rather will they attend you, if they are desired? But there do appear also evil spirits, and destroyers, which is caused by the envy and malice of the devil; and because men do allure and draw them unto themselves with their sins, as a punishment due to sinners. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover therefore desireth familiarly to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with spirits, let him keep himself from all enormious sins, and diligently pray to the most High to be his keeper; and he shall break through all the snares and impediments of the devil: and let him apply himself to the service of God, and he will give him an increase in wisdom.</p>

Some are destroyers of Cities, as those two were, who were sent to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> and the places ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent, examples whereof the holy Scripture witnesseth. Some are the watch-men over King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; others, the keepers of private persons; and from thence, any one may easily form their names in his own language: so that he which will, may ask a physical Angel, mathematical, or philosophical, or an Angel of civil wisdom, or of supernatural or natural wisdom, or for any thing whatsoever; and let him ask seriously, with a great desire of his mind, and with faith and constancy; and without doubt, that which he asketh he shall receive from the Father and God

of all spirits. This faith surmounteth all seals, &amp; bringeth them into subjection to the will of man. The Characteristical manner of calling Angles succeedeth this faith, which dependeth only on divine revelation; But without the said faith preceeding it, it lieth in obscurity.

                  <p>As our study of Magick proceedeth in order from general Rules premised, let us now come to a particular explication thereof. Spirits either are divine ministers of the word, and of the Church, and the members thereof; or else they are servient to the Creatures in corporal things, partly for the salvation of he soul and body, and partly for its destruction. And there is nothing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:108393:145"/>
done, whether good or evil, without a certain and determinate order and government. He that seeketh after a good end, let him follow it; and he that desireth an evil end, pursueth that also, and that earnestly, from divine punishment, and turneth away from the divine will. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every one compare his ends with the word of God, and as a touchstone that will judge between good and evil; and let him propose unto himself what is to be avoided, and what is to be sought after; and that which he constituteth and determineth unto himself, let him follow diligently, not procrastinaing or delaying, until he attain to his appointed bound.</p>

                  <p>They which desire riches, glory of this world, Magistracy, honours, dignities, tyrannies, (and that magically) if they endeavour diligently after them, they shall obtain them, every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his destiny, industry, &amp; magical sciences, as the history of <hi>Melesina</hi> witnesseth, &amp; the Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans thereof, who ordained, that none of the Italian nation should for ever obtain the rule or Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>; and brought it to pass, that he who reigned in his age, to be thrown down from his seat: so great is the power of the guardian or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telar Angels of the Kingdoms of the world.</p>

                  <p>Care is to be taken, that experiments be not mixed with experiments; but that every one be only simple and several. for God and Nature have ordained all things to a certain and appointed end: so that for examples sake, they who perform cures with the most simple herbs and roots, do cure most happily of all. And in this manner, in Constellations, Words and Characters, Stones, and such like, do lie hid the greatest influences or virtues in deed, which are instead of a miracle.</p>
                  <p>So also are words, which being pronounced, do forthwith cause creatures both visible &amp; invisible to yield obedience, as well creatures of this our world, as of the watery, airy, subterranean, and Olympick, supercelestial and infernal, and also the divine.</p>
                  <p>Therefore simplicity is chiefly to be studied, &amp; the knowledge of such simples is to be sought for from God; otherwise by no other means or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they can be found out.</p>

                  <p>And let all lots have their place decently: Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Reason &amp; Means, are the three things which do easily render all learning as well of the visible as invisible creatures. This is the course of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that some creatures are creatures of the light; others, of darkness: these are subject to vanity,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108393:147"/>
because they run headlong into darkness, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thral themselves in eternal punishments for their rebellion. Their Kingdom is partly very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in transitory and corruptable things on the one part, because it cannot consist without some virtue and great gifts of God; and partly most filthy and horrid to be spoken of, because it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth with all wickedness and sin, idolatry, contempt of God, blasphemies against the true God and his works, worshiping of devils, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towards Magistrates, seditions, homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, robberies, tyranny, adulteries, wicked lusts, rapes, thefts, lies, perjuries, pride, and a covetous desire of rule; in this mixture consisteth the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of darkness: but the creatures of the light, are filled with eternal truth, and with the grace of God, and are Lords of the whole world, and do reign over the Lords of darkness, as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ. Between these and the other, there is a continual war, until God shall put an end to their strife, by his last judgment.</p>

                  <p>Therefore Magick is twofold in its first divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the one is of God, which he bestoweth on the creatures of light; the other also is of God, but it is the gift which he giveth unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of darkness: and this is also two-fold: the one is to a good end, as when the Princes of darkness are compelled to do good unto the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, God enforcing them; the other is for an
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:108393:148"/>
evil end, when God permitteth such to punish evil persons, that magically they are deceived to destruction; or, also he commandeth such to be cast out into destruction.</p>
                  <p>The second division of Magick is, that it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to pass some works with visible instruments, through visible things; and it effecteth other works with invisible instruments by invisible things; and it acteth other things, as well with mixed means, as instruments and effects.</p>
                  <p>The third division is, There are some things which are brought to pass by invocation of God alone: this is partly Prophetical, and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical; and partly, as it were Theophrastical.</p>
                  <p>Other things there are, which by reason of the ignorance of the the true God, are done with the Princes of Spirits, that his desires may be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; such is the work of the Mercurialists.</p>
                  <p>The fourth division is, that some exercise their Magick with the good Angels instead of God, as it were descended down from the most high God: such was the Magick of <hi>Baalim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Magick is, that which exerciseth their actions with the chief of the evil Spirits; such were they who wrought by the the minor Gods of the heathens.</p>
                  <p>The fifth division is, that some do act with spirits openly, and face to face; which is given to few: others do work by dreams and other signs; which the ancients took from their auguries &amp; sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:108393:148"/>The sixth division is, that some work by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal creatures, others by mortal creatures, as Nymphs, Satyrs, and such-like inhabitants of other elements, Pigmies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The seventh division is, that the Spirits do serve some of their own accord, without art; others they will scarce attend being called by art.</p>
                  <p>Among these species of Magick, that is the most excellent of all, which dependeth upon God alone. The second, them whom the Spirits do serve faithfully of their own accord. The third is, that which is the property of Christians, which dependeth on the power of Christ which he hath in heaven and earth.</p>

               <div n="39" type="aphorism">
                  <head>Aphor. 39. There is a seven-fold preparation to learn the Magick Art.</head>
                  <p>The first is, to meditate day and night how to attain to the true knowledge of God, both by his word revealed from the foundation of the world; as also by the seal of the creation, and of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and by the wonderful effects which the visible and invisible creatures of God do shew forth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is requisite, that a man descend down into himself, and chiefly study to know himself; what mortal part he hath in him, and what immortal; and what part is proper to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and what diverse.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he learn by immortal part of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:108393:149"/>
himself, to worship, love and fear the eternal God, and to adore him in spirit and truth; and with his mortal part, to do those things which he knoweth to be axceptable to God, and profitable to his neighbours.</p>
                  <p>These are the three first and chiefest precepts of Magick, wherein let every one prepare himself that covets to obtain true Magick or divine wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that he may be accounted worthy thereof, &amp; one to whom the Angelical creatures willingly do service, not occultly only, but also manifestly, and as it were face to face.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, whereas every man is to be vigilant to see to what kind of life he shall be called from his mothers womb, that every one may know whether he be born to Magick, and to what spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereof, which every one may perceive easily that readeth these things, and by experience may have success therein; for such things and such gifts are not given but only to the low and humble.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place we are to take care, that we understand when the Spirits are assisting us, in undertaking the greatest business; and he that understands this, it is manifest, that he shall be made a Magician of the ordination of God; that is, such a person who useth the ministry of the Spirits to bring excellent things to pass. Here, as for the most part, they sin, either through negligence, ignorance, or contempt, or by too
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:108393:149"/>
much superstition; they offend also by ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards God, whereby many famous men have afterwards drawn upon themselves destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they sin also by rashness and obstinacy; and also when they do not use their gifts for that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God which is required.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The Magician hath need of faith and taciturnity, especially, that he disclose no secret which the spirit hath forbid him, as he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Daniel</hi> to seal some things, that is, not to declare them in public; so as it was not lawful for <hi>Paul</hi> to speak openly of all things which he saw in a vision. No man will believe how much is contained in this one precept.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, In him that would be a Magician, there is required the greatest justice, that he undertake nothing that is ungodly, wicked or unjust, nor to let it once come into his mind; and so he shall be divinely defended from all evil.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="40" type="aphorism">
                  <head>Aphor. 40.</head>
                  <p>When the Magician determineth with himself to do any incorporal thing, either with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior or interior sense, then let him govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self according to these seven subsequent laws, to accomplish his Magical end.</p>
                  <p>The first Law is this, That he know that such a Spirit is ordained unto him from God; and let him meditate that God is the beholder of all his thoughts and actions; therefore let him direct all the course of his life according to the rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:108393:150"/>Secondly, Always pray with <hi>David, Take not thy holy Spirit from me; and strengthen me with thy free Spirit; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: I beseech thee, O heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, do not give power unto any lying Spirit, as thou didst over</hi> Ahab <hi>that he perished; but keep me in thy truth.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Let him accustom himself to try the Spirits, as the Scripture admonisheth; for grapes cannot be gathered of thorns: let us try all things, and hold fast that which is good and laudable, that we may avoid every thing that is repugnant to the divine power.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, To be remote and clear from all manner of superstition; for this is superstition, to attribute divinity in this place to things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is nothing at all divine; or to chuse or frame to ourselves, to worship God with some kind of worship which he hath not commanded: such are the Magical ceremonies of Satan, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he impudently offereth himself to be worshiped as God.</p>
                  <p>The fifth thing to be eschewed, is all worship of Idols, which bindeth any divine power to idols or other things of their own proper motion, where they are not placed by the Creator, or by the order of nature: which things many false &amp; wicked Magicians fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>gn.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, All the deceitful imitations and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the devil are also to be avoided, whereby
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:108393:150"/>
imitateth the power of the Creation, and of the Creator, that he may produce things with a word, that they may not be what they are. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth only to the Omnipotency of God, and is not communicable to the creature.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Let us cleave fast to the gifts of God, &amp; of his holy spirit, that we may know them, and diligently embrace them with our whole heart, and all our strength.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="41" type="aphorism">

                  <p>We come now to the nine last Aphorisms of this whole Tome; wherein we will, the divine mercy assisting us, conclude this Magical <hi>Isagoge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore in the first place it is to be observed, what we understand by Magician in this work.</p>
                  <p>Him then we count to be a Magician to whom by the grace of God the spiritual essences do serve to manifest the knowledge of the whole universe, and of the secrets of nature contained therein whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are visible or invisible. This description of a Magician plainly appeareth, and is universal.</p>
                  <p>An evil Magician is he, whom by the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission the evil spirits do serve, to his temporal &amp; eternal destruction and perdition, to deceive men, and draw them away from God; such was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> of whom mention is made in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> and in <hi>Clemens</hi>; whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> commanded to be thrown down upon the earth, whereas he had commanded himself, as it were a God, to be raised up in the air by the unclean Spirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:108393:151"/>Unto this order are also to be referred all those who are noted in two Tables of the Law; and are set forth with their evil deeds.</p>
                  <p>The subdivisions and species of both kinds of Magick, we will note in the Tomes following. In this place it shall suffice, that we distinguish the Sciences, which is good, &amp; which is evil: whereas man sought to obtain them both at first, to his own ruin and destruction, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Hermes</hi> do demonstrate.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="42" type="aphorism">
                  <head>Aphor. 42.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to know, That a Magician is a person predestinated to this work from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb; neither let him assume any such great things to himself, unless he be called di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely by grace hereunto, for some good end; to a bad end is, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, <hi>It must be that offences will come; but woe be to that man through whom they come.</hi> Therefore as we have before oftentimes admonished, With fear and trembling we must live in this world.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding I will not deny, but that some men may with study and diligence obtain some species of both kinds of Magick, if it may be admitted. But he shall never aspire to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est kinds thereof; yet if he covet to assail them, he shall doubtless offend both in soul &amp; body. Such are they, who by the operations of false Magicians, are sometimes carried to Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> or in some wilderness or defarts; or they are maimed in some
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:108393:151"/>
member, or are simply torn in pieces, or are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their understanding; even as many such things happen by the use thereof, where men are forsaken by God &amp; delivered to the power of Satan.</p>

                  <p>The Lord liveth, and the works of God do live in him by his appointment, whereby he willeth them to be; for he will have them to use their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in obedience to his commands, or disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof. To the obedient, he hath proposed their rewards; to the disobedient he hath propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their deserved punishment. Therefore these spirits of their free will, through their pride and contempt of the Son of God, have revolted from God their Creator, and are reserved unto the day of wrath; and there is left in them a very great power in the creation; but notwithstanding it is limited, &amp; they are confined to their bounds with the bridle of God. Therefore the Magician of God, which signifies a wise man of God, or one informed of God, is led forth by the hand of God unto all everlasting good, both mean things, and also the chiefest corporal things.</p>
                  <p>Great is the power of Satan, by reason of the great sins of men. Therefore also the Magicians of Satan do perform great things, and greater than any man would believe: although they do subsist in their own limits, nevertheless they are above
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:108393:152"/>
all human apprehension, as to the corporal and transitory things of this life; which many ancient histories, and daily examples do testify. Both kinds of Magick are different one from the other in their ends: the one leadeth to eternal good, and useth temporal things with thanksgivings; the other is a little sollicitous about eternal things; but wholly exerciseth himself about corporal things, that he may freely enjoy all his lusts and delights in contempt of God and his anger.</p>

                  <p>The Magician understandeth when the mind doth meditate of himself; he deliberateth, reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, constituteth and determineth what is to be done; he observeth when his cogitations to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a divine seperate essence, and he prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of what order that divine seperate essence is.</p>
                  <p>But the man that is ignorant of Magick, is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to and fro, as it were in war with his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he knoweth not when they issue out of his own mind, or are impressed by the assisting es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and he knoweth not how to overthrow the counsels of his enemies by the word of God, or to keep himself from the snares and deceits of the tempter.</p>

                  <p>The greatest precept of Magick is, to know what every man ought to receive for his use from the assisting Spirit, and what to refuse: which he may learn of the Psalmist, saying, <hi>Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? in keeping thy word, O Lord.</hi> To keep the word of God, so that the evil one snatch it not out of the heart<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> is the chiefest precept of wisdom. It is lawful to admit of, and exercise other suggestions which are not contrary to the glory of God, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards our neighbours. not inquiring from what Spirit such suggestions proceed; but we ought to take heed, that we are not too much busied about unnecessary things, according to the admonition of Christ; <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art troubled about many things; but Mary hath chosen the better part, which shall not be taken from her.</hi> Therefore let us always have regard unto the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, <hi>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</hi> All other things, that is, all things which are due to the mortal Microcosme, as food, raiment, and the necessary arts of this life.</p>

                  <p>There is nothing so much becommeth a man as constancy in his words and deeds, and when the like rejoiceth in his like; there are none more happy than such, because the holy Angels are conversant about such, and possess the custody of
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:108393:153"/>
them: on the contrary, men that are unconstant are lighter than nothing, and rotten leaves. We chuse the 46 Aphorism from these. Even as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one governeth himself, so he allureth unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self spirits of his nature and condition: but one very truly adviseth, that no man should carry himself beyond his own calling, lest that he draw unto himself some malignant Spirit from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost parts of the earth, by whom either he shall be infatuated and deceived, or brought to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal destruction. This precept appeareth most plainly: for <hi>Midas,</hi> when he would convert all things into gold, drew up such a Spirit unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which was able to perform this; and being deceived by him, he had been brought to death by famine, if his foolishness had not been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the mercy of God. The same thing happened to a certain woman about <hi>Franckford</hi> at <hi>Odera,</hi> in our times, who would scrape together and devour money of any thing. Would that men would diligently weigh this precept, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the histories of <hi>Midas,</hi> and the like for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; they would be much more diligent in mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating their thoughts and affections, neither would they be so perpetually vexed with the spirits of the golden mountains of <hi>Utopia.</hi> Therefore we ought most diligently to observe, that such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption should be cast out of the mind, by the word, while they are new; neither let them have any habit in the Idle mind, that is empty of the divine word.</p>

                  <p>He that is faithfully conversant in his vocation, shall have also the spirits constant companions of his desires, who will successively supply him in all things. But if he have any knowledge in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, they will not be unwilling to shew him, &amp; familiarly to converse with him, and to serve him in those several ministeries, unto which they are addicted; the good Spirits in good things, unto salvation; the evil Spirits in every evil thing, to destruction. Examples are not wanting in the histories of the whole world; and do daily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the world. <hi>Theodosius</hi> before the victory of <hi>Arbogastus,</hi> is an example of the good; <hi>Brute</hi> before he was slain, was an example of the evil Spirits, when he was persecuted of the Spirit of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and exposed to punishment, that he slew himself, who had slain his own Father and the Father of his country.</p>

                  <p>All Magick is a revelation of Spirits of that kind, of which sort the Magick is; so that the nine Muses are called in <hi>Hesiod,</hi> the ninth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, as he manifestly testifies of himself in <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogony.</hi> In <hi>Homer,</hi> the genius of <hi>Ulysses</hi> in <hi>Psigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogagia.

From hence springeth all Magick, and thither again it will revolve, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evil. In this manner <hi>Tages</hi> the first teacher of the Magick of the Romans, gushed out of the earth. <hi>Diana</hi> of the Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans shewed her worship, as if it had been sent from heaven.
