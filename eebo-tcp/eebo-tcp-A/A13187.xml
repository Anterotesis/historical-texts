            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst Artes and Sciences (Right ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Lady) there is none, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, more beseeming our Christian care, then that which teacheth to <hi>liue</hi> well and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilie whilest wee are heere, so when we are gone wee may liue eternally. For most sure it is, that vpon this moment of time, depends either an vnrecouera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble losse, or a happie welfare in


<pb facs="tcp:24724:4"/>
the world to come. And from hence is it, that I call the well ordering of life in this world, <hi>A learning to liue: a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> because wee ought to make it a matter of labour, and studie; <hi>to liue,</hi> because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good and godly life, wee are said rather to <hi>be,</hi> then <hi>liue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To stirre vp our dulnesse to this <hi>learning,</hi> I haue thought good to lay before the eies of the well disposed mind, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the life of Christ, the best pattern for imitation that euer the world had. Children will follow their parents. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth teach the Bees to goe forth at the very voice of their King or Leader: wee may goe to Schoole to those small crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wee haue not onely the voice of our heauenly King &amp; Leader, but according to his

humanitie, his example also to call vs forth to gather the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant sap of seueral vertues, that so at the euentide of our age, we may returne loaden with the sweete honey of holinesse, vnto that safe Hiue of euerlasting peace.</p>
            <p>From this most diuine life of Christ our Sauiour, there doe arise three principall reasons, before other, for our better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction in this lesson of <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to liue.</hi> The first is drawn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lesse to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as thus, We should be <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, meeke, patient:</hi> Christ the Sonne of God himselfe was so. The second is taken from his example, We should <hi>be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> vnto others, <hi>louing</hi> to our friends, <hi>charitable</hi> to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: this our Redeemer did. The third is from the end, Wee


<pb facs="tcp:24724:5"/>
ought <hi>to endure</hi> the crosses &amp; calamities of the world: Christ endured them, and so entred into his glory.</p>
            <p>How little this <hi>Learning</hi> is thought vpon, much lesse pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, wee see it too apparantly before our eyes. Of this Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> complayned long agoe, when hee willed men ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haue <hi>opera secundum professionem,</hi> that is to say, workes according to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, or <hi>professionem se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum opera,</hi> a profession agreeable to their workes: for this default, there needes no farther proofe but experience, when some haue little of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, except the name.</p>
            <p>Other Treatises (right ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Lady) may seeme forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to call men to the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life; by this, in tabing

Therefore was he the summe of the Law &amp; Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the Law, teaching vs what to doe: the Gospel, what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue: so in Christ both beléeuing and doing concurre in one.

When hee heard the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels make that heauenly melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die at his birth, there he thought he was the Sonne of God, but when he saw the tender babe in Bethlehem, with <hi>Mary</hi> his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, layd in a Manger, there he thought he was the Son of man.


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:24724:89"/>
When hee saw him circumcised, then he thought there appeared a plaine signe of his humanity: but when hee heard the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, <note place="margin">Luk, 2, 21.</note> then he began to suspect his Deitie. When hee saw him bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised with the multitude, hee thought, sure he was the Sonne of man: but when the voyce came <note place="margin">Mat. 3, 16. 17.</note> from heauen, then he heard other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that hee was the Sonne of God. When he saw him fasting so long, and not hungering, then he thought he was the Sonne of God: but when at the end of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dayes hee hungred, then hee thought hee was the Sonne of man. And therefore in the first place, he assayes him by eating, as man, with a conditionall, if, to haue hun shewe his power, whether he were or no the Son of God.</p>
               <p>But our Sauiour, when hee had fasted forty dayes and forty nights, hee proceeded no farther, that the power of his Deitie as yet might be hid, seeing that <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> men, had afore time fasted so long. Forty dayes


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:24724:89"/>
without hunger, was not of man; and yet afterward to hunger, was not of God: and therefore the deuil as doubtful what to do, tempted him after this manner, <hi>If thou art the Sonne of God,</hi> that naturall Sonne, and so equall to him in power, <hi>Commaund that these stones may be made bread.</hi> There is a voyce that hath testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of thée from heauen, that thou art the Sonne of God, canst thou liue by this title or testimonie? thy Father, either he sées not thy distresse, or he will not helpe thée: the best way is, helpe thy selfe, and looke thou to thine own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, while the voyce is testifying thou art staruing.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Christes often praying, and specially in the Garden, when his soule began to wax sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and what feruencie in deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we heere learne.</head>

                  </gap>rd, there in time the daunger is very great. For the passion of Iesus Christ, let vs remember our selues, and thinke a little more of calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:24724:160"/>
God, by religious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout prayer, remembring who it was that spent whole nights in prayer, when he was labouring for the sinnes of the world, &amp; the saluation of our soules.</p>
               <p>If the eyes of God doe at all times, and in all places beholde vs, then most especially when we present our selues before him in prayer, when both attention of mind, and humiliation of body concurre, actions most befitting humble sutors. We often repeat that of the Prophet, <hi>O come let vs worship, and fall downe before the Lord our maker,</hi> but doe it not, by humbling of our bodies, for to sue pardon for our soules.</p>
               <p>To approach and enter vnto the place of prayer, as if wee came to sit in commission with God, or would countenance him in his own house, is as vnséeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a custome as Christianity can yéeld. To dehort men nowe a dayes from long prayer, we are eased of that labour, (which Christ vsed in refuting the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so many care not how


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:24724:161"/>
little they pray at all: nay which is more, when some séeme not to make so much account of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duty vnto God, wherin Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians assemble themselues in publike prayer.</p>
               <p>And yet for all this not onely to speake of prayer, but of feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in prayer, may be helpfull to our Christian desires in seruing God, séeing our deuotion is often so remisse, as wee may seeme ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to speake then pray; seeing the very house of prayer is almost made nothing lesse, whereas our repairing thither, minds vs of a duty to be performed: therefore he that prayes not in the Church doth as hee that eates not at a banquet, that learnes not at the Schoole, that fights not at the warre, that walkes not when he is in his iourney. There is a matter of moment to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that wee pray, and after what manner.</p>
               <p>In consideration héereof, let vs obserue at this time Christes praying in the Garden, when his <note place="margin">Mat. 26, 31.</note> soule began to waxe sorrowfull,


<pb n="279" facs="tcp:24724:161"/>
as the Euangelist testifieth.</p>
               <p>In this his praying, we may consider these circumstances. First, that it was solitarie, for that hee now left his Disciples, as hee had oftentunes before done, when he went out alone to pray: which doth commend vnto vs solitary praying. Secondly, hee prayed with humiliation of <note place="margin">Lu. 22, 41.</note> body: S. <hi>Luke</hi> saith, he knéeled downe and prayed; S. <hi>Mathew</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26, 39. Mark. 14. 35.</note> and S. <hi>Marke,</hi> that hee fell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth: The Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists may soone be reconciled, for it may séeme hee first knéeled, and afterward for faintnesse hee was faine to fall prostrate: and this commends vnto vs humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in praying. When he ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> &amp; restored the dumbe <note place="margin">Ioh. 11, 41. Mar. 7, 34</note> man to the vse of speaking, wee finde he lifted vp his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which was sometimes his gesture in praying. When <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> prayed, he held vp his hands vntill the going downe of the <note place="margin">Ex. 17, 12.</note> sunne, which holding vp of the hands, <hi>Dauid</hi> called his euening <note place="margin">Ps. 141. 4.</note> sacrifice. When <hi>Steuen</hi> prayed, he


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:24724:162"/>
knéeled downe according to Christes example, héere in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <note place="margin">Acts. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ce mentioned.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third circumstance to be obserued in this our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours praying, is, that it was iust, and right: for hee subiected his wil to the wil of his Father, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Situ vis, If thou wilt:</hi> which doth teach vs to commend our selues, &amp; all our petitions, wholy to the will of God.</p>
               <p>The fourth, that it was with sorrow, for he was in an agonie, and this doth put vs in minde of that of the Apostle. <hi>The spirit helpeth our infirmities, for wee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26</note> 
                  <hi>knowe not what to pray as wee ought, but the spirit maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for vs with sighes, which cannot be expressed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fift, that it was with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance: for hee came three times vnto his Disciples, three times and in thrée places was he tempted, and thrée times did hee héere pray, and willed his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to pray, that they enter not into temptation. O what deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was héere? his last supper


<pb n="281" facs="tcp:24724:162"/>
being ended, hee goeth forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with his Disciples, &amp; speakes vnto them (as a louing father vpon his death bed, when hee hath not much to say) giues his children precepts at parting which they should remember, when hee is gone from them, of which precepts, this was not the least, <hi>Watch &amp; pray, that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 26. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>not into temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> goe with him: for those to whom hee had before shewed the glory of his transfiguration, to them would he now shew the humility <note place="margin">Mat. 17. 1</note> of his passion, that as they had séene glorious thinges, so nowe should they sée humble thinges, to these hee sayeth: <hi>My soule is sorrowfull, vsque ad mortem;</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, euen to begin to feare death: or <hi>vsque,</hi> vntill, may be taken indefinitelie, and so, my soule is sorrowfull vnto death, that is, vntill a satisfaction for the sinnes of the world be made by death: or <hi>vsque,</hi> vntill, may bee taken inclusiuely, and so, My soule is sorrowfull vnto


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:24724:163"/>
death, that is, vntill the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of my death be turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the life of faith: <hi>Tristis est anima mea,</hi> My soule is sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull.</p>
               <p>Héere <hi>Anselme</hi> crieth out, <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de hoc Deus mi?</hi> How commeth it to passe, O my God, that thou taking vpon thée the nature of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n, shouldest begin to forget thou art God?</p>
               <p n="4">4 Christ assumed this feare and sorrowfulnes for many cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: First, to proue the truth of his humanity, for it is naturall vnto man to feare death, and of this naturall sorrowe was our Lord sorrowfull: yet so doe wee <note place="margin">Mark. 14. 68.</note> vnderstand him to be sorrowfull, and to feare, not with that feare and sorrowe, which ordinarily drowneth reason, and causeth man to ouershoote himselfe, as <hi>Peter</hi> for feare of death denied his <note place="margin">Mar. 8, 33</note> Maister. This manner of feare was farre from Christ, for hee came for this intent to suffer, and reproued <hi>Peter</hi> when he disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him from going to Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and suffering there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:24724:163"/>
There is a kinde of stepping backe, naturally incident vnto all, which at this time appeared in Christ as other humaine acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did, his eating, his sléeping, his hunger, &amp; the like, all which were in Christ (finne onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) properly as in man: now this sorrow &amp; feare was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in Christ, then in vs. In vs for the most part the passion of feare doth goe before the rule of the will, and the iudgement of reason; but in Christ it did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after, for both the will and the iudgement of reason went before: for when hee hungred and thirsted, hee did it willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of iudgement, hee feared willingly, hee sorrowed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and of iudgement. By this then, there is nothing to be considered in Christ as constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but all is to be beléeued as voluntarie, and therefore feare and sorrow, as they were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, so were they voluntarie and rationall. Wherefore, the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the text saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>Coepit contristari,</hi> hee began to


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:24724:164"/>
feare, he began to be sorrowfull, and not hee was fearefull. Feare and sorrowe began in the part sensitiue, but came not to the minde or vnderstanding. For when the Euangelists say, <hi>His soule began to be sorrowfull,</hi> there the soule is taken for the part sensitiue, in which are passions. And héere we may consider, that Christ could not die by nature, as Adam could not die vntill hee committed sinne: <hi>(For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of sinne,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>was death)</hi> but as hee tooke vpon him humane nature, so did hee also without our infirmities, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that voluntarilie which was incident to our nature, yea to our fall.</p>
               <p n="5">5 A troubled passion ariseth in the minde, eyther besides the decrée of reason, or in opposite manner against the decree of reason: The former of these two is sometime incident vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men; although the best a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men: the second, to the imperfect onelie. A perfection farre surmounting both was in


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:24724:164"/>
Christ, for that in him, sence was subiect vnto reason, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son vnto will, the will to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the vnderstanding to God.</p>
               <p>Christ was sorrowfull, sayth Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> not for any feare <note place="margin">Hiero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wee sée according to the iudgement of the auncient Fathers, how farre our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours feare was from distrustfull thoughts or weaker passions, which to thinke to be in him, were most impious: but in these sufferings being rightly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, wee sée a most admirable conueniencie in all, without fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying of vnlearned and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conceites.</p>
               <p n="6">6 To come to matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, for that is most he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeful of all: In this sorrowing of our Sauiour, we learne these


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:24724:165"/>
things: First, to kéepe down by the rule of reason, sorrowes, and passions that arise in vs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine them, and kéepe them in obedience vnto the will. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, no: to dispaire if sorrow and feare at any time surprise vs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the suffering of death. Thirdly, to be sorrowfull for the state of others, after Christs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Fourthly, amidst all our sorrowes to repaire onely vnto God, and commend our selues vnto him as Christ did, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, &amp; thus vniting our sorrowes with his sorrowes, wee shall the better beare them.</p>
               <p n="7">7 This done. Christ depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a stones cast from them, and there prayed, <hi>Father, if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remoue this cup:</hi> he saith <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>Father,</hi> and we too (saith the Apostle) say <hi>Abba, Pater:</hi> twise Father, both according to the Hebrew &amp; Gréeke, shewing that God is now Father of Iew and Gentile. Hee saith, <hi>If it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> referring the graunt of his petition to the will of God: if it may stand with the same wil, and


<pb n="287" facs="tcp:24724:165"/>
not otherwise. Hee prayeth for the remouing of that Cup, yet so, that looking to obedience, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forward towards his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and saith, <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>at voluntas tua:</hi> Thy will be fulfilled. What of <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 39.</note> humane desire he before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hee now in action procéedeth to relinquish, as if he would say, Let not that be done which I haue spoken according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affection, but let that be done, for which I was sent into the world, and now am willing to suffer. That which he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as man, to wit, the remouing of the Cup, he now leaueth, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing whollie to procéede with the will of God. But was the will of Christ any way differing from the will of his Father? No verily, for hee saith, <hi>Non quaero voluntatem meam, sed volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 5. 30</note>

8 Hee prayeth the third time the same thing, shewing that hee goeth to pray, and to pray the selfe same thing too: not of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnesse, but of very feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Whereby wee may obserue, that to pray and pray againe, is a part of high deuotion: The Doue went forth of the Arke the <note place="margin">Gen. 8. 11.</note> first time, and returned sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as she went out, still the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were vp: she goeth forth the second time, then the flood is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and shee brings a branch of Oliue, a signe of quiet &amp; peace, First, a sorrowfull prayer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth, still the waters of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie are vp: the prayer go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth againe, behold the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are fallen, prayer brings a crop of Oliue, ioy, and tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mind.</p>
               <p n="9">9 At the end of Christs pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Angels appeare comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, they who at this time séeme to haue presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the presence of God the Father, astonished at the agonie of his Sonne, came foorth, and pray for the remoouing of this


<pb n="289" facs="tcp:24724:166"/>
Cup: answer is made, my sonne hath of méere loue and mercie, vndertaken the redemption of man by the effusion of his blood, which could be brought to passe by no other meanes: which the Angels hearing, they returned to Christ, and in honouring, they comfort him; and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting they honour him. And héere obserue wee three thinges: First, that our Sauiour prayeth long before hee receiueth an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: to shew, wee must not by and by giue ouer. Secondly, that the greater his agonie was, the longer his prayer was: to shewe that in greatest agonies wee should continue long in prayer. Thirdlie, in that the Angels came and comforted him, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that if wee continue with constancie, the Angels reioyce ouer vs: In that the drops of blood came downe, it shewed the greatnesse of our Sauiours conflict, wherein hee seemed both to doe, and to suffer: his blood was true blood according to his naturall existence, but yet


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:24724:167"/>
myraculous and supernaturall, if we respect the manner: for it is aboue nature to poure out toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther water &amp; blood, which Christ did both aliue, and dead: behold, O Christian soule, thy redéemer and Sauiour cast into sweate for thy sinnes. In this it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest how bitter his passion was, whose onely thought so much chaunged nature. Of this our Sauiours sweating may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered these seuerall obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, first, the greatnes of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonie: secondly, that this agonie caused sweate, when it was a cold night: thirdly, this sweate falling vpon the earth, wee may gather that the earth or men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the earth, haue benefit héereby.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Now was presented before the eyes of the Sonne of God, on the one side, Gods iust iudgment and wrath towards man, yet vnappealed: on the other side, death and hell as yet not vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: himselfe left as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to enter the conflict, putting forth his hand to receiue the cup,


<pb n="291" facs="tcp:24724:167"/>
and yet he beginneth to pull it in againe, but after a little while, goeth forward with full resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the worke well begun, which hee brought to a most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie end.</p>
               <p>Let the deuout man learne, in all the pressure of aduersity, to set before him Christes agonie in the garden; be it that doubtfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects betwéene feare and sorrow doe much obscure our naturall delights: héere haue wee for times of trouble a president to follow, but chiefely in the aganie of death, when sick man are pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and labouring for life, they are said then, especially to endure an agonie, for then beginneth a conflict, nature drawing one way, and obedience to the will of God another: the spirit goeth forward, and the flesh draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth backward: besides, many thoughts occurre about leauing the world, and going to answere for our time here spent, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other things seldome before thought vpon.</p>

               <p n="5">5 For thrée causes did Christ our Sauiour wéepe, and at three seueral times. First, Christ wept that wee should haue by so much the more our hope and confidence in him when wee sée him wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, which procéeded of meere compassion. Secondarily, Christ wept to teach vs to weepe, and bewaile our owne miserie, as hee did the miserie of others. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, he wept, to shew vs when we should wéepe, euen then when wee thinke our selues in greatest securitie.</p>
               <p>At thrée times also did he wéep, first in raysing <hi>Lazarus,</hi> there he bewayled mans miserie. Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily, ouer Ierusalem, there hee bewayled mans securitie: Thirdly, vpon the Crosse, there hee bewayled mans infirmitie. If our Sauiour Christ were séene to weepe in the presence of

others, wee may easily conceiue that secretly in the dayes of his flesh, he often offered vp groanes, as the Apostle speaketh, with <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> strong crying, and teares vnto him, that was able to deliuer him.</p>
