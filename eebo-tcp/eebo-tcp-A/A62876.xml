            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I find by very many evidences, that my Writings about a point, which few can concoct, have caused such an avers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the spirits of a great number, even of those that seem to be inquisitive into truth, that my later Writings, even those which have been recommended to the World by the
<pb facs="tcp:100176:5"/>
chief of my Antagonists, though not much contradicted, yet have not found such receptions, as such arguments were deemed to require. Which had discouraged me from this kind of imployment, did not the expectation of my giving account about the improvement of the talent committed to me by my Lord and Master, make me judge, that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained from publick Preaching, I ought to use it in this way, out of hopes of serving my generatian therein. Being busied in some other Arguments, I met with the Book which I here examine, and not long after with another, having this Title <hi>[Prelatical Preachers, none of Christs Teachers]</hi> whereby I perceived, that the seeds of most rigid separation were sown, and did spread themselves much among many, whose good I conceived my self bound to endeavour; and not only for their sakes, but also for the publick Peace, (as much as in me lies) to pluck up such roots of bitterness; Which I rather thought did appertain to me to do, because I found that many that had heard of my judgment in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther point, did imagine, that I must needs be also a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratist from the Church and Ministers as now they are; and where my practice is known to the contrary, I have been censured as acting against my own tenet, yea, and my own light, and taken to be, and shunned as a deserter of that Cause for which I have appeared: notwithstanding in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of my Writings I have disclaimed Separation, for that, wherein I was dissenter from others, alwayes foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a groundless Separation would be endless, and therefore have still professed my desire of such a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as might be without Separation from Brethren, who are not heretical in the doctrine of Christian Faith, nor Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous in their Worship; nor impose that on me for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, which I cannot yield to without sin against God, and accordingly did in express words in the <hi>Addition to my Apology, Sect. 4.</hi> declare <hi>my willingness to joyn

I abhor Separation from my Brethren in this regard:</hi> p. <hi>10.

Praecursor. Sect. <hi>15. I am conscious to my self of using what means I could for Reformation without Schism if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi> Yea, when some of those who agreed with me in that tenet, which my Writings held forth differently from others, were moved to admit me to their Communion, and they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against it, because I did not disclaim the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor renounce Ordination by a Bishop, nor desert my standing as a Parish Minister, nor my maintenance by Tith or <hi>Augmentation,</hi> nor my hearing with the World, as they used to speak, nor some such like practices as were inconsistent with the principles of the Separatists: I refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed many years ago to joyn with them that would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise admit me than upon such terms; but did answer their exceptions against me, and persisted in my refusal unto this day. And how averse my spirit and wayes have been from division, that Antagonist of mine whose former Writings had given occasion to men to conceive of me as a <hi>Sect-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi> yet hath in his two Epistles Printed before my two Books, one against the Quakers about the insufficiency of each mans Light within him for his guidance to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Nine Sermons on Joh. 1.9.</hi> and the other, entituled, <hi>Romanism Discussed,</hi> against the Papists assertions about their Church and Pope, declared his opinion of my

inclinableneness to brotherly Communion and agreement, notwithstanding our dissent. They to whom I was a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, even in the times of our greatest Liberty, can bear me Witness, that I alwayes withstood by Writing and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence such insinuations as tended to alienate their minds from Dissenters, and alwayes advised conjunction in Church Communion, and hearing such as taught the truth of the Gospel in respect of the foundation, though in their Worship and Preaching, some Hay and Stubble were superadded: And therefore to shew my constancy in the same opinion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, I have conceived my self obliged to appear in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at this time.</p>

               <p>Which I conceived my self the more urgently provoked to, by the direful imputation of <hi>serving the Image of the Beast,</hi> which the Title of the Book chargeth on the Hearers of the present Ministers; and the terrible predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which in the Epistle to the Reader seem to be levelled against compliance in hearing the present Ministers; as if it were likely to meet with the same judgment in the day of Gods wrath with the Antichristian Beast; and seeming commiserations of such as did joyn in Communion with the publike Church Assemblies, in praying and preaching, as worshiping with the Nations, <hi>waiting at the Posts of an Antichristian Ministry, and through the power of temptation turned aside by the flocks of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;</hi> and expostulating with such as <hi>forsaking the fountain of living Waters, for broken Cisterns that will hold no Water; changing their glory for that which will not profit, leaving the bread in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, and going a begging to the doors of
<pb facs="tcp:100176:7"/>
Strangers; casting contempt upon the pure Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christ, and thereby provoking the Lord to send leanness into their soul, giving occasion of grief and stumbling unto their Brethren, pouring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the Offices, Wisdom, and Faithfulness of Christ, hardning persons in a false way of worshiping of God to their eternal ruine, disobeying the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voice calling aloud to them to come from the Lions dens, and Mountains of the Leopards, to come out of Babylon;</hi> admonishing them to <hi>arise, depart hence, this being not their rest, but polluted, to hasten their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, and be like the He-goat before the Flocks in their retreat from the Tents of these false Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, lest being partakers of their sin, they receive of their plagues that are even ready to be poured forth.</hi> Which is further pressed by intimating as if this may be the last warning such may have from God. Which passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges if I should my self read without commotion of mind, as if they were <hi>brutum fulmen, a great Thunderclap with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Thunderbolt;</hi> yet I doubted whether they might not have such operation on many well-meaning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as to affright them from any hearing or Communion with the present Church or Teachers, as judging such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance a damnable sin, such as the Scripture makes drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the cup of Fornication of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the mark of the Beast in their forehead, and in their hand and in some an irremissible sin; like that of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost; which must needs produce these woful effects, an irreconcilable enmity between the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists and such as hold Communion with the present Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and their Pastors; and if the Law should not be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated, the utter ruine of many thousands, in respect of their Liberties, Estates, and perhaps Lives; or else the violation of their Consciences, if being possessed with these
<pb facs="tcp:100176:7"/>
notions out of fear, or secular hope they yield to things of so direful an aspect; which things have appeared to me of so great importance, that I conceived both prudence and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity bound me to examine these pretences, and to inform my self and others of what I found conducible to the preventing of those sad consequences which attend the compliance, if it it be such as it is pretended to be; and the unyieldingness to what Laws injoyn, if it be not such an evil as it is accused to be. That which Dr. <hi>John Burges</hi> in his <hi>Rejoinder,</hi> said <hi>p. 629.</hi> is to be considered. As under the name of Christ and pretence of advancing his honour, Antichrist was set up; so it is possible that under the name of Antichrist, and under the opinion of only opposing him, even the Kingdom of Christ may be pulled down: and in part already is so, and men scarcely feel or fear it.</p>

               <p>Whereunto I have been further incited by the relations I have met with; of the practices and success of Separatists of elder and later times: which have for the most part ended in some prodigious errours, or endless brawls, and other effects as have caused great hinderance to the progress of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and the disturbance both of the Ecclesiastical and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Peace in those places where they have had any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable duration.

               <p>First he conceives it <hi>a reasonable</hi> Postulatum <hi>in the present en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry concerning our part of the instituted worship of Christ under the Gospel, with respect unto the duty incumbent upon the Saints; in order thereunto, that the whole thereof be divolved upon the Scriptures of the new Testament; and those Royal Lawes, that Christ (the alone King and Law giver of his church) hath given for Saints under the New Testament dispensation to walk by, untill they arrive unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</hi> Eph. 4.13.</p>
               <p>Answ. The term [<hi>worship of Christ or worship of God used</hi> Chap. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] imports such an action as whereby God is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, served, or honoured as God, and Christ as Christ. All actions therefore, whereby God and Christ are acknowledged and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified under the proper consideration of God or Christ as God or the Messiah, are meant by worship of God and Christ: Either of which may be real, or putative and imaginary. They that worshipped the golden Calf did proclaim <hi>a feast to Jehovah,</hi> and said, <hi>these are thy Gods O</hi> Israel <hi>that brought thee out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.5, 8. which shews they intended to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Jehovah as God by that feast, and the sacrificing to that Idol, but this was not real worship of God, but only imaginary and false worship. Real and true worship is either mediate or immediate. Mediate is when any action of holiness or righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is done in obedience to God as the motive or impulsive cause, to glorifie God as God, Christ as Christ, as the end or final cause; yet not without respect to some other. So by works of <hi>righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost, Christ is served acceptably to God,</hi> Rom. 14.18. <hi>Servants that obey their Masters fearing God do it to the Lord and not to men, and thereby serve the Lord Christ,</hi> Col. 3.22, 23, 24. Where the Action of it self is not a worship of God or Christ, but in respect of the motive and end, though the doing of the thing be not <hi>per se of it self</hi> a worship of God, yet it being done by vertue of Gods Command and in reference to him as God, it is in that respect a worship of God and a Service of Christ. Immediate worship is that which is directed to God as the sole object of it without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100176:12"/>
of any other, as for whose sake, end or use it is done, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom it is terminated for his honour, though it may be that some other may be used as the means, by which the action is done. As for instance, offering Sacrifice to God was immediate worship to God, though it were done by the Priest: because, though the Priest were used by reason of his office and dignity, yet it is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to, or terminated on him for his honour, nor out of any such respect of acknowledging superiority or excellency in him, as in a servants obedience to his Master, nor to benefit him, or gratify him as in acts of righteousness to men out of obedience to God, but the action is done entirely, and immediately to and for God his honour, and glory, by testifying thereby his excellency, worthiness, soveraignty, goodness, or other excellency, which I conceive agreeable to the notion of worship, which seems to be a contract of [worthyship] and notes singular respect, esteem, or regard, by reason of some worth in the thing worshipped con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the heart, and expressed by some signe, the former being inward worship, the other outward, this] gather from the use of the term <hi>Worshipfull; your worship</hi> given to superiours by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their dignity, and the use of the words in the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of marriage, [<hi>with my body I thee worship</hi>] that is, honour thee in the sence in which St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 3.7. requires the husband <gap reason="foreign">

Now hearing is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God or Christ in the former notion, it being for enquiry of God or Christ, what is their minde or will towards us, out of apprehension of our dependence on them or respect to them, as a Servant on his Master, a Scholler on his Teacher. And then we worship God in hearing when we hear, as it is said of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Thessal.</hi> 2.13. <hi>that when they received the word of God, which they heard of St.</hi> Paul <hi>and other Teachers,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100176:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh also in them that believe.</hi> Hearing then, as it is a worship of God, is a seeking from God such revelation as may be for our benefit, arising from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension we have of his omnisciency, goodness, wisdome, and truth, who neither can be deceived nor deceive, that <hi>he only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, that we are to call no man our Father upon the Earth: for one is our Father which is in Heaven, Mat.</hi> 23.9. As on the contrary when <hi>Ahazias</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. sent to <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron</hi> to enquire of that Idol, he worshipped <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> and when <hi>Saul enquired of one that had a familiar Spirit and not of the Lord,</hi> 1 Chron. 10.13, 14. He worshiped that familiar Spirit. Our Lord Christ is <hi>that Prophet whom God requires us to hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto us,</hi> Acts 3.22. <hi>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Prophets, hath in these last dayes spoken to us by his Son</hi> Heb. 1.1, 2. And they that hear his word as the person to whom <hi>all things are delivered by the Father,</hi> Mat. 11.27. <hi>as he in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdome, and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.3. <hi>as that great Prophet who was to come into the World,</hi> Luke 7.16. do worship Christ in hearing. As on the other side he that heareth any other as Rabbi or master, in that sense in which Christ asserts himself to be the only Master, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8, 10. (as the Papists do, who enquire of the Pope as infallible, when he speaks or determins from his Chair) doth worship him as his great Prophet, Rabbi, or Master, which Christ forbids as an usurpation of his prerogative. This worship of Christ is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate even when we enquire of his minde by hearing other teachers who bring his word to us, though not called as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and some others in the first planting of the Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as he that attends to a Kings Proclamation read or brought by never so inconsiderable a person, declares by his Loyal hearing of it his honouring of his Prince, not of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of which sort I take hearing the word of God to be, though some pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities there are which the Almighty hath tied us to in the New Testament in hearing: as <hi>Mat.</hi> 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.</hi> Luke 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you heareth me, and he that despiseth you despiseth me, and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</hi> Yet these passages do not exclude the precepts or directions of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, but presuppose them to be heard and learned in respect of the matter therein contained, and the persons that reveal it, so our Lord Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29. <hi>They have</hi> Moses <hi>and the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>let them hear them.</hi> 2 Peter 1.19. <hi>we have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place.</hi> Nor do I meet with any prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions of hearing any but <hi>False-Prophets,</hi> Mat. 7.15. <hi>deceivers,</hi> Titus 1.10. <hi>that teach other doctrin,</hi> 1 Tim 1.3. 2 John 10 <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gospel,</hi> Gal. 1.8, 9.

               <p>But perhaps the Author means by [<hi>instituted worship of Christ</hi>] such as is meerly positive, or as we use to speak, ceremonial; such as are Baptism and the Lords Supper, which are only worship of God, by institution in the New Testament, which is probable to be his meaning by what he adds [<hi>not perplexing our selves, nor the Consciences of any, with what was (or may be supposed to be) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the Saints before the time of reformation, whilst the worldly Sanctuary was yet standing, the carnal ordinances pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereunto, in being at least by the providence of God not sully dissolved as afterward, both it and they were, being buried in the ashes and ruines of that Temple, to which they were inseparably annext.</hi>] But if he make hearing of the present Ministers, such an instituted worship of God or Christ he seems to me very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate, hearing of preachers being a moral and perpetual worship common to all times and persons, not a meer positive or ceremonial, as being baptized or receiving the Lords supper are, and therefore by reason thereof it is not a <hi>reasonable</hi> postulatum, which he demands to be granted him, that <hi>in the present enquiry the whole thereof be divolved upon the Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</hi> Yea were it granted him, yet it would disadvantage those separatists, with whom he concurs in Judgment about Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and separation from the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters thereof, who use many places of the Old Testament, not only about the Sabbath and it's observation, but also about Baptism and the Lords Supper.

communicated unto the present Enquiry, by a retrospection into the state of things in the time of the Old Law, it shall not be grievous to us (nor will it be altogether unprofitable to the Reader) briefly to remark, so far as may concern the matter in hand, the state and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of affairs under that Oeconomy and Dispensation: Not to mention the Administration of Holy things in the time of the Antedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luvian Fathers; nor the General Apostacy from the pure wayes of God, in the dayes of Seth; (when according to their duty, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remnant (the sons of God) separated from the Wicked (or the daughters of men) and solemnly joyned themselves together to worship God according to his holy appointments, Gen.</hi> 4.26.) <hi>Let us take a brief view of things, with relation unto the People of God, after the giving of Moses Law, when a Standard was set up for them to repair unto, and they became (being gathered into one) as a City on an Hall, conspicuous unto all.</hi>

               <p>Answ. <hi>How some beams of light may be communicated unto the present enquiry, by a retrospection into the state of things in the time of the Old Law,</hi> will not be easie to discern, <hi>if the whole thereof be divolved on the Scriptures of the New Testament.</hi> Yet it will not <hi>be grievous</hi> to me to examine what I find produced for his purpose. I grant that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> hath in his Book in <hi>Latine,</hi> of <hi>the nature, rise, progress, and study of true Theologie,</hi> shewed divers Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Ages before and after the Flood of <hi>Noah</hi> in Theologie; and the pure Worship of God, unto <hi>Moses</hi> his time; and that the restitution of true Theologie was sometimes by a separation from the Wicked, when there was <hi>a general Apostacy from the true wayes of God,</hi> unto a prophaning of the Name of God, (as some conceive <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.26. is meant) either by blaspheming, or by setting up of Idol-worship; as it was before <hi>Abrahams</hi> separation, <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.15. But neither by him, nor I think, by any other is it shewed, that a separation was approved from Preachers, that teach no worse Doctrine than is held forth by the Articles, Homilies, and other avowed Books of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; or from a Society or Church that was no more polluted by Idolatry or other Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Worship, than are chargeable on the publick enjoyned Worship of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.26. be meant of a Reformation, by setting up separate Congregations (as Dr <hi>Owen</hi> conceives in that Book, <hi>l</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) it was, that therein they might <hi>call on the Name of the Lord</hi>; which shews it was from them that did not call upon the Name of the Lord, not from them that did as in the Worship of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is done. And if <hi>Noah</hi> did reform by separation, it was from Wicked men, who had <hi>filled
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100176:15"/>
the earth with violence, Gen.</hi> 6.13. which doth indeed make a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary separation, (though it appear not but that <hi>Noah</hi> continued to preach to them, and live among them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.) But is not the cause of the separation avowed by this Author from the Ministers and Church of <hi>England.</hi> And though it be true, that by the Law at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and other acts of Gods providence, <hi>Israel became (being gathered into one) as a City on a Hill, conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous unto all,</hi> yet how then a <hi>Standard was set up for the people to repair unto,</hi> needs some explication, sith such as <hi>Job,</hi> and such like holy persons (if he or any other lived at that time) seem not to have repaired to them, nor were bound to repair to them, unless they would be made Proselytes, which the avoiding Idolatry, of the Gentiles might require of them; not such Corruptions onely as are in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But let us see what <hi>beams of light may be communicated unto the present enquiry, by retrospection into the state of things in the time of the Old Law.</hi>

                  <hi>First then,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the Lord gave unto the people of the Jews (whom he had chosen out of all the Nations of the World, to be a People near to him, his peculiar Treasure above them all) Statutes and Ordinances to walk by, both with relation to Civils and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks, which they were indispensably bound to conform to, without adding to, or detracting therefrom: That the management of all their affairs was singly to be bottomed upon, and conform to these Statutes and Judgments is very frequently asserted in Scripture, Exod.</hi> 21.1. <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19.37. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26.15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 43. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.1, 5, 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.1, 32. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30.16. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 28.7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.30. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36.27. <hi>Dan</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is granted that the Lord gave unto the people of the Jews Statutes and Ordinances to walk by, both with relation to Civils and Ecclesiasticks, or (as usually they speak) Ceremonials; and that they were bound to conform to them, and so much the Texts alledged do prove. But that they were bound indispensably to conform to these Statutes, without adding to, or detracting therefrom; and that the management of all their affairs was sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly to be bottomed upon, and conform to these Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is not asserted in those Scriptures, there being not one of them, that saith that they were bound indispensably to conform to them. Our Lord hath determined to the contrary in justifying
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100176:16"/>
his Disciples plucking the ears of Corn on the Sabbath; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> eating the shew bread and entring into the house of God, and confirming his determination by the words of the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> 6.6. in his dissertation against the <hi>Pharisees, Mat.</hi> 12.3, 7. in which there was a dispensation with, and detraction from the Laws of the Sabbath, and the Shew-bread about Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks, for a time in some Case.

And that the management of all the affairs of the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> both civil and ecclesiastical, was not singly to be bottom'd upon and conform to those statutes and judgments, but that in both sorts of affairs humane prudence, and the Rulers Authority might order many things, may be cleared from sundry instances of <hi>David, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> and others; which there will be occasion more fully to discusse in examining the allegations brought by this Author to prove the major of his first argument Ch. 1. of this treatise.</p>

               <p>Secondly, saith he, <hi>that persons were appointed by the Lord to be chosen by the Congregation for the publick administration of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and worship, cannot be denied: Thus were the Levites, Exod.</hi> 13.2, 12, 13. <hi>and</hi> 22.29. <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>called therefore the Wave-offering of the Children of</hi> Israel, Numb. 8.9, 10, 11. <hi>because given up by them to the Lord as their offering, by solemn or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, and imposition of hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answer, it is true, that the Levites were wholly given unto God from among the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> to do the service of the Congregation; but it is not true, that <hi>they were appointed by the Lord to be chosen by the Congregation. God saith,</hi> Numb. 8.16. <hi>in stead of the first-born of all the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>have I taken them to mee. And upon what occasion God took the Levites in stead of the first born, is to be seen in</hi> Exod. 32.26, 29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.9. Saith <hi>Ainsworth annot.</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.12. So that here appears no choice of the Congregation, so as that it was left to them to take or to leave those. It is true also, that <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.9. it is said, <hi>that</hi> Moses <hi>shall bring the Levites before the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100176:16"/>
it was therefore his business to present them, and <hi>that he should gather the whole assembly of the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>together,</hi> and <hi>that he should bring the Levites before the Lord, and the Children of</hi> Israel, that is, <hi>some of the chief of them, (as the first born) in the name of the rest shall lay or impose hands on the Levites,</hi> saith <hi>Ainsworth annot.</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.10. And then it follows, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Aaron shall offer or wave the Levites before the Lord, for an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering or wave-offering of the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>that they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the service of the Lord. And then</hi> Aaron <hi>was to make an atonement for the Levites, and</hi> Moses <hi>should set the Levites before</hi> Aaron <hi>and before his Sons, and offer them for an offering unto the Lord, and that he should separate the Levites from among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Israel: <hi>and the Levites should then be Gods. v.</hi> 13, 14. The reason of the laying on of the hands of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> upon the Levites, was to signifie their obedient yielding them to God in <hi>their stead, to do the service of the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and to make an atonement for the Children of</hi> Israel: <hi>that there might be no plague among the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>when the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>came nigh unto the Sanctuary, v.</hi> 19. But these were not the Priests, they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the Levites, to wit <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>his Sons, who were called of God, Heb.</hi> 5.4. without the Prophets laying on of hands. Now it was the Priests office to do that work, in which was the worship of God to wit the offering Sacrifice, sprinkling the blood, and such other duties, the Levites were imployed to do other servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the bearing of the utesils and such like, in respect of which they were to attend on the Priests, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.8. &amp; therefore it is said by God, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>I have given the Levites as a gift to</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons.</hi> So that the choice was Gods, the presenting <hi>Moses</hi> his act, the yielding them by imposition of hands signifying their offering them to God, in stead of themselves, was the act of the first-born, the wave offering, and cleansing them, <hi>Aarons</hi> act, which may more truly be called their solemn ordination than the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands by the first-born. But were it true, that in this act of imposing their hands there was election and ordination, this wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, saith he, <hi>that persons thus invested into the office of Priesthood were not left to the liberty of their own wits, nor have they any dependance upon the will or Authority of the Sons of men, (one or other of them) either in respect of the matter or manner of their worship, the whole whereof was purely of Divine institution and Divine appointment, Exod.</hi> 25.9, 40. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28, 11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.27. <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Exod.</hi> 39.1, 5, 7, 21, 26, 31, 43, and 40.23, 25, 27, 29. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.9, 13, 17, 21, 29. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.10, 29. <hi>and</hi> 36.1, 5. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 29.13.</p>
               <p>Answer, The Levites were not invested into the office of the Priesthood by solemn ordination &amp; imposition of hands of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel,</hi> but <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, and therefore as it was an usurpation in <hi>Uzziah</hi> to burn incense to the Lord, sith it <hi>apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Priests, the sons of</hi> Aaron <hi>that were consecrated to burn incense,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.18. So it was the sin of <hi>Korah</hi> that, not content with that service he was to do, he would usurp the office of the Priests, to come nigh the Altar and to burn incense, or as it is <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.10. <hi>to seek the Priesthood, which was in degree above the Levites, who were to minister unto the Priests, but not to come nigh the Altar,</hi> as <hi>Ainsworth</hi> proves in his <hi>Annot.</hi> on <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.10. out of <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.2, 3. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.48, 49. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.13. It is granted that neither the Levites nor the Priests in their office or service were left to their own wills, nor had they any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the will or authority of the sons of men (one or other of them) either in respect of the matter or manner of their worship, which was of Divine institution, and Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Every circumstance of time, place, order, habit, and what ever else was particularly determined, was to be strictly observed under pain of death, if presumptuously done otherwise; as in the case of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Hophai</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> or cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable negligence as in the case of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> and if it were by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet an offering was to be made for an atonement, and thus much it is granted the Texts alledged do prove. But neither these texts nor any other do prove that no circumstances about place, time, order undetermined by God were left to the liberty of the people, or Prince, or Sanhedrin, or Priests in and about the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100176:17"/>
worship of God among the Jewes, who yet had their service more fully particularized in all things pertaining to it than we have.

The text, <hi>Isai.</hi> 29.13. alledged in the first chapter out of <hi>Mark</hi> 7.7. will there fitly be considered, that we may discusse, whether the whole of their worship was purely of Divine institution and appointment in respect of the matter, and manner of it.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, saith he, <hi>that this Church gathered by the Lord, and wonderfully separated from the rest of the world (though they had him nearer to them than any people had his Law made known amongst them) did notwithstanding quickly depart from his pure institutions, mingling therewith the inventions of men, and customes of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (after which they went a whoring) is frequently remarked in the Scripture: of this the Lord sorely complains, Deut.</hi> 32.18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.32. <hi>and</hi> 13.25. <hi>and</hi> 23.27. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.6. <hi>and</hi> 8.14. <hi>and</hi> 13.6. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Jer</hi> 1.16. <hi>and</hi> 2.17, 19. <hi>and</hi> 9.13. <hi>and</hi> 15.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.5. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.33. <hi>and</hi> 18.18. <hi>and</hi> 19.10. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.17. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.10. <hi>for this he severely threatens and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth them, Deut.</hi> 29.25. <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.10. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.5. <hi>and</hi> 24.20. <hi>and</hi> 34.25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.11. <hi>and</hi> 19.4. <hi>the very truth is, the contests of God with that people from first to last, are to be bottom'd upon this foot of account.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answer, It is true, that Church of <hi>Israel</hi> was gathered by the Lord, and wonderfully separated from the rest of the world by great signs, miracles, providences, and judgments; which he shewed against their enemies and towards them, especially by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> and that he did not, till Christ came, so gather, and wonderfully separate any Church from the rest of the World, as he did them. But after the ascension of Christ by the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospel, and other wayes he hath gathered out of all Nations his Church, and wonderfully separated it from the rest of the world. It is true also, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> quickly departed from Gods pure institutions mingling therewith the inventions of men, and customs of the Nations. But those inventions of men and customs of the Nations, which the Texts alledged mention, were such as were expressely forbidden, drew them to serve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100176:18"/>
other Gods and to forsake the Lord, not such as are usually by seperatives called inventions of men, to wit humane ceremonies, confessed out of the case of worship in themselves to be things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, such as out of pretended prudence at least, or publique authority are imposed for discipline, order, or decency without giving any Divine worship to a Creature. Let all the Texts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged be viewed, and there is none of them, that mentions the mingling such inventions of men, no not those, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour reprehends in the Pharisees, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.3, 4, 8. (which are farr worse) as the departing from Gods pure institutions, nor doth God contest with the people of the Jewes, in those places alledged for other inventions of men and customes of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than such as were Idolatrous, and therefore the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and punishments in those places are grossely abused, when they are applied to the imposing or use of such ceremonies or discipline as are (whether rightly or wrongly) retained in the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, saith he, <hi>that notwithstanding their dreadful Apostacy from God, they were usually confident, that they were the only Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had not forsaken the Lord, nor done any evil, and could not bear the Prophecies, and rebukes of the Prophets and Servants of the Lord, against their abominations: whom they persecuted and put to death (as at last they did the Prince of Life and Glory) for no other cause but for telling them the truth, and bearing testimony against their Innovations, and Apostacy from God (the usual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of persons degenerated from the way and Spirit of the Lord) Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.8. <hi>John</hi> 8.39. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.52.</p>
               <p>Answer, All this is granted, and if this Author can prove any such innovations and Apostacy from God (as the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, and other Servants of God, rebuked in the Jewes) in the People or Teachers, who adhere to the doctrin, worship, or discipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> this Author with others of his minde, do well to bear their testimony against them as the Prophets did, and they that persecuted them for so doing, may expect the like judgments of God to fall on them, as fell on the Jewes. But if it be otherwise, and the things inveighed against, be not such as they make them, and their bearing testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

               <p>Sixthly, saith he, <hi>that they had all along their corruption in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and degeneracy from the worship of God, false Prophets (who ran before they were sent, prophesying smooth things to them in the name of the Lord, seeing Lying vanities for them, according to the desires of the hearts of them, and their Rulers, who were therefore in great esteem amongst them.

               <p>Answer, All this is granted, and if any of the Preachers in <hi>England</hi> prophesie lies in Gods name, or bring in damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, denying the Lord that bought them, or are such as those, whom the Texts alledged describe, let them be branded as false Prophets. But if they teach the fundamentals of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion truly, and in respect of the substance of worship, use no other than God hath appointed, though they may in some points remote from the foundation erre, and use some things in and about the worship of God, which should not be, yet do not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the worship of God in substantials, then are they false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, who accuse them as if they were such, as those Texts of Scripture alledged do describe.</p>

               <p>Seventhly, saith he, <hi>that in the height of their Apostacy, God left not himself without a witness, having one or other, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily raised up and spirited by him, to testify for his name and glory, against all their abominations, and self-invented wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, reserving also a remnant unto himself, that were not carried away with the Spirit of whoredoms and delusions,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.14, 18. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.13. <hi>Romans</hi> 11.3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.11. <hi>and</hi> 25.5. <hi>and</hi> 35.15.</p>
               <p>Answer, That self invented worship was <hi>bowing the Knee to</hi>

Baal, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.3, 4. <hi>serving Idols,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.12. <hi>burning Incense to vanity, Jer.</hi> 18.15. <hi>going after other Gods to serve them and worship them, Jer.</hi> 25.6. and 35.15. If there be found any such self-invented worship in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it will do well to testifie against it. But if there be not such abominations and self-invented worship, these texts will not justify Persons, who have no other than ordinary calling, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify against them, much less to censure them as <hi>whoredoms</hi> and <hi>delusions,</hi> and they that practice them <hi>as carried away with the spirit of whoredoms and delusions.</hi> And though persons may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they imitate <hi>Elijah,</hi> are <hi>extraordinarily raised up, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by God,</hi> and that they <hi>testify for Gods name and Glory,</hi> when they call the Common-prayer Book an Idol, the Ministers that conform <hi>Baals</hi> Priests, the Communion the Mass, with such like <hi>Billingsgate</hi> Rhetorick, yet it is not unlikely, but that it may be truly verified of such, which our Lord Christ said to <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> when they would have <hi>fire commanded to come down from Heaven and consume the</hi> Samaritans, <hi>even as</hi> Elias <hi>did, ye know not what manner of Spirit ye are of:</hi> and that it may be bitter and not holy zeal which moves them, and their language judged by God not just reproof, but unjust reviling.</p>

                  <hi>Sect. 13.</hi> The forsaking of false Prophets and worship among the Jewes, is no justification of separation, from the present teachers and worship.</head>
               <p>Eighthly, saith he, <hi>that it was the sin of that People to hearken unto the teachings of such as were not sent by the Lord (though they pretended never so much to be sent by him) and the unquestionable duty of the Lords preserving Remnant, to separate from them, as also from all the false devised worship of that day, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by their Kings and Rulers,</hi> 2 Kings 17.21, 22. Hos. 5.11. <hi>The former is evident, such Prophets were to be cut off from the middest of them,</hi> Deut. 18.20. <hi>and they are expressely forbidden to hear them,</hi> Deut. 13.3. Jer. 27.6, 16. <hi>so is the latter, their devised worship being a breach upon the soveraign Authority of God, must needs be a grievous sin, as the names of Adultery, Whoredom, Idolatry, Fornication, by which the Spirit of the Lord doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently set it forth, abundantly demonstrates</hi>; Psal. 73.27. Isai. 57.3.8. Jer. 9.2. EZek. 23.45. Hos. 3.7. <hi>and</hi> 7.3. Lev. 20.5. Jer. 13.27. Ezek. 16, 17.20.30. Hos. 1.2.

to separate from, and have no communion with any in, upon what pretence soever: which is solemnly charged upon them as their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Scripture, Hos.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.14. <hi>and</hi> 5.8. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p>Answer. None are said in those Texts or any other I meet with, not to be sent by the Lord, who delivered the truth of God, but they only in those places are denied to be sent by God, who delivered falsehoods, and such falsehoods as were inciting to Idolatry, or contradictions to the messages of the true Prophets, and such were not to be heard, though they should be comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nded by Kings and Rulers, who ought to cut them off, <hi>when they spake in Gods name a word, which he had not commanded them to speak, or did speak in the name of other Gods, Deut.</hi> 18.20. And if they <hi>sought to turn them from the Lord to serve other Gods, they were not</hi> only <hi>not to hearken to them,</hi> but also, if they were never so near to them, <hi>they should not spare them, but kill them, Deut.</hi> 13.9. which I presume he will not say of the present ministers of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and therefore me thinks he should have left out these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, if he had well bethought himself how unfit they were to his present designe. That devised worship, which is termed Adultery, Whoredom, Idolatry, Fornication, is <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.5. <hi>Committing whoredom with</hi> Molech, Psal. 73.27. <hi>being farre from God, going a whoring from him,</hi> Isaia 57.5. <hi>inflaming themselves with Idols under every green Tree, slaying the Children in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys under the Clefts of the Rocks,</hi> Jerem. 9.2. <hi>treachery,</hi> Jer. 13.27. <hi>abominations on the hill in the fields,</hi> Ezek. 16.17. <hi>making to her self images of men to commit Whoredom with them, v.</hi> 20. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing their Sons and Daughters to them to be devoured,</hi> Ezek. 23.37. <hi>Committing Adultery with Idols,</hi> Hos. 1.2. <hi>departing from the Lord, Revel.</hi> 14.8. <hi>and</hi> 18.9. <hi>such fornication as</hi> Babylon <hi>made all Nations, even Kings of the earth to commit,</hi> and from such it is without controversie the people of God were to separate, and have no communion with any in, upon any pretence whatsoever, nor in any other sin by joyning in the practice, and if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent worship of the Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> be any such fornication, or the hearing or joyning with them, must be a partaking with them in any sin, so farre at least, they are to be separated from. But neither the Texts alledged, nor any other do require sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the worship of God, or the Ministers that are in some things corrupt, even in their ministration; when <hi>Hophai</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> did corrupt the worship of God, yet <hi>Samuel</hi> did lawfully minister before the Lord, and <hi>Hannah</hi> did well in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100176:20"/>
him thereto, and her self at the solemn Feasts, and even-while there was burning incense, and sacrificing in the High pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, those of <hi>Judah</hi> were not to separate from the service at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> which was to God, and though the High Priests were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly set up, and sundry corruptions, and superstitions in the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, and the services of the Jews in our Lord Christs time on Earth; yet did our Lord Christ joyn in the publick service of the Temple, and perswaded the cleansed Leper to offer to them the gift that <hi>Moses</hi> commanded. Wherefore I inferr, that though there should be some degree of Corruption in Worship, and that this should be a breach upon the soveraign Authority of God, as every sin is, and a grievous sin it is; yet this might not be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause of separation from the Worship, Church, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, of it, and that the allegation of the Texts produced, will not be sufficient for the design of this Author, in urging separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Ministers and Church of <hi>England.</hi> But let us further attend his motions.

                  <hi>What may rationally be inferred from these positions, so evidently comprized in the Scripture, and by way of Analogy at least may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from them, is evident to any ordinary understanding; for our parts being resolved (as was said) to trie out the matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, from such rules and soveraign Institutions, as our dear Lord hath left his New Testament Churches to walk by, we shall not stand to make that improvement of them as otherwise we might: A few Queries upon the whole that hath been offered, shall put a close to this Preface.</hi>

As for arguing by way of Analogy from the institutions of the Old Testament to those of the New Testament from supposed parity of reason, how little rationality, or force there is therein, I presume he may perceive, if he read the second part of the <hi>Review</hi> of my Dispute about <hi>Paedobaptism, Sect.</hi> 2.3. wherein how infirm the way of arguing from such Analogy is, is so far evinced, that I judge, that if the improvement he thinks he might make of his positions for his purpose, be by that

way of proof, it will be found insufficient by an ordinary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, whether he hath kept to his resolution of tiy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter in controversie, by the rules and institutions of the New Testament, will appear by the examining of the ensuing Discourse.

                  <hi>Sect. 15.</hi> The first Querie about a National Instituted Church answered.</head>
               <p>His first Querie is, <hi>Whether since the Apotomy or Unchurching the Nation of the Jews, the Lord hath ever since so espoused a Nation or People to himself, as that upon the account thereof, the whole Body of that People or Nation may be accounted his Church? Whether there be any National Church under the Oeconomie of the Gospel? If so, Let it be shewed when, and where it was instituted by the Lord: What is produced by some to this purpose, is (but upon a slight view thereof) of no moment, it is</hi> Isa. 49.21. Kings shall be your Nursing Fathers, &amp;c. <hi>which Prophesie waits the time of its accomplishment: hitherto, both before and since the rise of Antichrist (being made drunk by the Whores intoxicating Cup) they have been, for the most part, cruel Butchers of the Saints: and were we under its accomplishment, a National Church would be far enough from being its result. Of a Nations being born at once, we shall not sure hear pleaded in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it being a Prophesie expresly relating to the Jews, and their mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous conversion: if there be no such thing as a National Church of the Institution of Christ, as most certain it is there is not (the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof is wholly destructive of Gospel Administrations)</hi> then,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> As King <hi>James</hi> in his <hi>Remonstrance against Cardinal</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons <hi>Oration,</hi> saith, <hi>that the appellation and name of the Church ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in this corrupt Age, as a Cloak to cover a thousand new inventions</hi>; meaning this of the Popish party: so may we say also of others, that by reason of the ambiguous use of the appellation and name of the Church, and the dictates of men about it, the minds of many are perplexed and perverted. Wherefore in answering this first Querie (which the Separatists do so much harp upon) it is necessary that there be a distinct understanding of the notion of the Church, and its Institution. The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>ng of the New Testament use. Now in the New Testament, excepting what I find <hi>Act.</hi> 19.32, 39, 40. where it is applied to Assemblies of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, whether tumultuary or orderly, and <hi>Act.</hi> 7.38. where it is applied to the Congregation of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wilderness, in all places in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> the <hi>Epistles of the Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> it is meant (so far as I discern) of the Christians, or People of God, or their Meeting or Assembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As it notes the Christian Believers, or People of God, so it is taken sometimes for the Universal Church, whether invisible or visible, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.22. sometimes for the visible Church indefinitely, but not universally, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9. sometimes for the Church Topical, and then it is taken for the Church of a City, or Town, or House; and so we read of the Church at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, Act</hi> 8.1. of <hi>Corinth, Ephesus, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Philemons</hi> house, <hi>Philem.</hi> 2. or of a Country or Nation, and then it is put in the Plural number, as the Churches of <hi>Asia, Galatia, Judaea.</hi> In the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists History of the doings, sufferings, and sayings of our Lord Christ, I find the Word [Church] used but in two places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. and 18.17. Of the extent and meaning of both which Texts there is so much controversie, not only between the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants and Papists, but also among the Protestants themselves of different persuasions about Church Government, that it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Treatise by it self to make a thorough discussion of those two Texts in order to the clearing of the Controversies that are started about them. That <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. is undoubtedly meant of the Christian Church, but whether Oecumenical, visible or invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, or indefinite, or topical, is doubted. It is without any proof appropriated to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any particular Church as ordered under this or that peculiar form of Government; but is to be taken for the number of Believers in Christ, whether of <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> more or fewer, abstractively from any political considerations, and such external adjuncts and denominations, as whereby usually Churches are in common speeches diversified. In the other place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. in as much as it is not said [<hi>tell my Church</hi>] but [<hi>tell the Church</hi>] and the term [<hi>thy brother</hi>] may as well be meant of a Brother, as by birth, or proselytism adjoyned to the Jews, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Jews by birth <hi>his brethren, kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men according to the flesh, Rom.</hi> 9.3. (in which sense it may seem
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100176:21"/>

Institution of a Church by Preception or Command I find not: neither Christ nor his Apostles (that I know) have given us any rule or law of bounding, modelling, or numbring Churches. There is a precept <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians <hi>should not forsake the assembling of themselves together, as the manner of some was.</hi> But none about the defining how many should go to a Church, or be accounted to belong to one Church; no determination by any precept concerning Members belonging to a Church, whether they should be fixed to one Meeting, or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatory, and moveable; sometimes belonging to one Assembly, sometimes to another of the same profession. Nor do we find any Institution of Churches, whether they ought to be Domestick, Congregational, Parochial, Classi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ordering of such distinctions Christ and his Apostles (so far as I deprehend) have left to Divine Providence, and Humane Prudence, allowing more or fewer to a Church, as the imes will permit, the increase or diminution of Believers should be, as Pastors may be had, and their Partitions and Meetings be convenient for their edification and government. It is true, the Romanists would infer from Christs promise to <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Upon this Rock will I build my Church,</hi> that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and after h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that by [<hi>Christs Church</hi>] is meant the universal Church, and by [<hi>Christs building</hi>] it is meant constituting an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Bishop, is an assertion without proof. In some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> have been stiled Oecumenical; but so also have other Patriarchs. <hi>We believe one Catholick and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi>; but so denominated from their common confession or the same Faith; not from union to, and subjection under one visible Church head. Mr. <hi>Paul Bayne</hi> (as I remember) long since disputed against Diocesan Churches for Parochial: and in the <hi>Assembly at Westminster</hi> the dissenters against this proposition, <hi>that many particular Congregations may be under one Presbyterial govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:100176:22"/>
from such distinction of Churches as the New Testament yields. But the Arguments seem not to me to be cogent, they declaring only what was done <hi>de facto,</hi> not what was necessary to be done <hi>de jure.</hi> That Text <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. is much urged by sundry sorts of Pleaders, for their several wayes of Church-government. But it is uncertain whether by [<hi>Brother</hi>] and [<hi>Church</hi>] be meant Christian Believers, and the Christian Church; and if Christian Believers and Church be meant, whether <hi>the Church</hi> be meant of the Christian Civil Judicatory, or Ecclesiastical Consistory, or Congregational Assembly of Believers of all ranks: or some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Arbitrators, that of which the Church is to have cognizance, being there no other than <hi>the sin of one Brother against another,</hi> which v. 21, 22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3, 4. shew to be meant only of private tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes or injuries done by one to another, who might remit or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them; nor is any other act ascribed to <hi>the Church,</hi> than an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the injurious Brother, to do right to him whom he hath wronged; whereupon it is then allowed, or appointed upon non-satisfaction to him, or disobedience to <hi>the Church,</hi> without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juridical sentence mentioned, that he that is thus disobedient should be to him that complained, <hi>as a Heathen or Publican,</hi> with whom the <hi>Jews</hi> would not have familiarity. Nothing is said of being such to <hi>the Church,</hi> or by vertue of its sentence juridical, or being excluded <hi>à sacris,</hi> which we are sure the Publicans were not, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.10. These things seem to me to evince, that neither is here that instituted Church, which the Assertors of Congregational Churches and Church-government urge, as the only Churches and Church-government of the New Testament, and inculcate as <hi>the pattern in the Mount,</hi> and any other way to be as <hi>the setting of mans posts by Gods posts,</hi> and separate from a National Church as a humane Invention. Nor is here that Church-government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted (which they make the only Government appointed by Christ) that the Congregation, or the <hi>major</hi> part are to cast out, exclude from Communion in Holy things in every Church, though but of seven or eight, every member that sins and will not obey the monition of the rest of the Congregation. These things being premised, I answer to the Questions in the first Querie fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is granted, <hi>That since the Unchurching of the Nation of the Jews, the Lord hath not yet</hi> (that we know of) <hi>so espoused a Nation, or People to himself, as that upon the account thereof, the whole Body of that People or Nation may be accounted his.</hi> We say that Christ hath <hi>redeemed us to God by his bloud, out of every Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100176:22"/>
and Tongue, and People, and Nation, and hath made us unto our God, Kings, and Priests, Revel.</hi> 5.9, 10. We own no Church visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now, but of Believers, by their own personal profession. We approve the 19. Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>visible Church of Christ, is a Congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred according to Christs Ordinance, in all those things that of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity are requisite to the same.</hi> The addition in the Confession of Faith of the Assembly, <hi>Ch.</hi> 25. <hi>Art.</hi> 2. <hi>that the visible Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal under the Gospel, consists of all those throughout the World that profess the true Religion, and of their Children,</hi> is not found in the Writings of the New Testament, and those Texts that are alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. if they were pertinent, would as well prove a whole Nation to be Gods visible Church, yea, all mankind descended from <hi>Eve,</hi> as the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church to consist of the children of them that profess the true Religion. And the same may be said of them that assert an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Infants visible Church-membership unrepealed, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. as proving Christs appointing Nations as such to be baptized, that alledge the Jewish Proselytism as a pattern to us. How far this Quaerist agrees with these, may be discerned by other passages. If he concur with those of the Congregational way about Church-members, and their proof from the Covenant to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.7. as made to his natural seed, and so to all Believers natural seed, I see not how he can avoid the asserting of a National Church like the Jewish; which I grant is not agreeable to the Gospel, according to which, <hi>the visible Church of Christ is a Congregation of faithful men,</hi> as the definition of the Church of <hi>England, Art.</hi> 19. expresseth it, and hath been fully proved by me in the third part of my <hi>Review, Sect.</hi> 52. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In answer to the Question, <hi>Whether there be any National Church under the Oeconomy of the Gospel?</hi> I say, that though there be no National Church, so as that the whole Nation, and every member of the Nation be to be accounted of the visible Church of Christ, by vertue of their Generation, or Proselytism, and such Covenant as was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning his natural seed, or to <hi>Israel</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> or elsewhere; yet the whole number of Believers of a Nation, may by reason of their common professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be called a National Church, as well as the <hi>whole Body of men throughout the World, professing the faith of the Gospel, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God by Christ according unto it, not destroying their own profession by any errours everting the foundation, or unholiness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100176:23"/>
are and may be called the visible Catholick Church of Christ,</hi> as the Congregational men speak in their <hi>Declarat. ch.</hi> 20. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no more against the Gospel to term the Believers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> than it is to term the Believers throughout the World, the Catholick Church; nor is it more unfit for us to term our selves Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this respect, than to term our selves Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church; nor is there need to shew any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the Lord more for the one than for the other. Nor is there need to alledge <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.20. or <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.8. for such an Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Of some whereof, see Rev.</hi> 17.12, 16, 17. And Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.17. hath these words; <hi>For truly out of the same ten horns, or Kings, they shall be, who at length shall hate the Whore whom they have so long born, (which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we perceive to be fulfilled) shall make her desolate, and naked, shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</hi> Nor is it to be denied without ingratitude to God and Men, that <hi>Kings and Queens since the rise of Antichrist (though many of them made drunk by the Whores intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating cup, have been cruel Butcherers of the Saints</hi>) both before the Reformation, and since, even in our dayes <hi>have been nursing Fathers, and nursing Mothers to the Church of Christ,</hi> and that a <hi>National Church,</hi> in the sense fore-mentioned, <hi>hath been the result of its accomplishment</hi>; and we hope in more ample manner, will be the result of its fuller accomplishment. As for the Text, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.8. that <hi>it is a prophesie expresly relating to the Jews, and their mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous conversion,</hi> is not certain. Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> in his <hi>Annot.</hi> on <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.8. hath these words, <hi>The most Interpreters, both Jew and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, understand these words, of the strange, sudden, and unexpected delivery of the remainders of Gods people out of the Babylonian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage

by</hi> Cyrus. <hi>Howbeit, divers Interpreters understand them of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and restauration of the Church under the Ministry of the Gospel, when so many thousands were so soon, and so suddenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, without any great labour, or pains-taking about them, of those by whom they were converted,</hi> Act. 2.41. &amp; 4.4. <hi>and both these Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions conceived, as subordinate the one to the other, may very well be admitted.</hi> And therefore if the Author hear it not pleaded in this matter, yet he may find another Exposition than that which he imagines, that it expresly relates to a future miraculous Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Jews. However if it did, sith it is said <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>When the fullness of the Gentiles is come in, all Israel shall be saved</hi>; he might find something for a National Church in that Prophesie, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.8. As for those words in his Parenthesis, [<hi>that the assertion of a National Church of the institution of Christ, is wholly destructive of Gospel administrations,</hi>] they are said with no more truth than proof, though we should say, a National Church, in respect of its Government, or Officers, is of the Institution of Christ. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it were asserted, that Christ had instituted Patriarchs or Arch-bishops, and Bishops, and the Government of the Church of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> under them, yet this might be without total destruction of Gospel Administrations. The preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, administration of Baptism and the Lords Supper with other administrations of Christian Worship and Discipline, have been, and may be continued even where Archbishops and Bishops have been over a National Church as instituted by Christ. But let us attend his motions: thus he goes on. <hi>If there be no such thing as a National Church of the institution of Christ, as most certain it is there is not; then</hi> 2. <hi>Whether National Ministers are the Ministers of Christ, or whether there can be a true Ministry in a false Church, as a National Church must be, if not of Divine Institution, upon what pretence soever it be so denominated?</hi>

                  <hi>Sect. 16.</hi> National Ministers may be Ministers of Christ, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Churches true Churches.</head>
               <p>To this Querie I answer, 1 That if by [<hi>National Ministers</hi>] be meant Ministers for the Nation, or such as have inspection over the Nation, whether for the maintenance or propagating of true Doctrine, or Worship, or holiness of life, they may be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, though no such thing as a National Church were of the institution of Christ. As for instance, I conceive Dr. <hi>James Usher</hi> (when he was alive) was a Minister of Christ, when he was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100176:24"/>
Primate of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The assertion I prove thus, If the Apostles were Ministers of Christ, and National Ministers, though a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church were not instituted of Christ, than National Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters may be Ministers of Christ, though a National Church be not instituted of Christ: But the Apostles were such, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>Peter</hi> had the Apostleship of the Circumcision, <hi>Paul</hi> of the Gentiles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. Therefore National Ministers may be Ministers of Christ. 2. <hi>Titus</hi> was a National Minister of the <hi>Cretians, For this cause,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 1.5. <hi>left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldst set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain Elders in every City, as I had appointed thee,</hi> and yet a Minister of Christ, St. <hi>Pauls partner and fellow-helper concerning the Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Ergo:</hi> 3. They that may be Ministers of Christ, though they be Ministers for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, and all the Members thereof, may be Ministers of Christ, though National; because the denial of a National Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry is upon this supposition; that a Minister of Christ is only for one particular Congregation, but the Pastors and Teachers, as well as Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets, are given <hi>for the edifying of the Body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, unto a perfect man, Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. Therefore, for all, or any; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, for a Nation, and not only for a particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 4. If any of the Saints, as well as one particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, have an interest in all the Ministers of Christ, so as that they are truly theirs, then Ministers of Christ may be National; yea, ought to be; yea, and Oecumenical, if they could be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them in the things of Christ. But 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> were all the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and all others who were Christs; therefore the same may be Ministers of Christ, and National Ministers. I know not whether this might be an argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> but this I take to be justifiable, that a man may be a Commissioner for approbation of publick Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers throughout a Nation, and so a National Minister, or an Itinerant Preacher to the Nation, and yet be a Minister of Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A National Church, denominated so, either from the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Believers in that Nation, in the same profession, or from their subjection to some Common Rulers Ecclesiastical or Civil, or Convening by Deputies in some National Synod, though not of Divine Institution, may be a true, and not a false Church: which I prove thus. They may be a true Church, who have all things essential to a Church, and nothing destructive of its being
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100176:24"/>
such. But Believers of a Nation, or a National Church, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated any of those wayes, may have all things essential to a Church, and nothing destructive of its being such; <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is taken from the proper notion of the term [True Church] or its definition. For the definition of a Church of Christ, or a true Church, is and can be no other than a Company or Number of persons believing in Christ, or <hi>professing the Faith of the Gospel, and obedience to God by Christ according unto it, not destroying their own profession by any errours concerning the foundation, or unholiness of conversation,</hi> even according to the expression of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men in their <hi>Declaration, Octob.</hi> 12.1658. <hi>ch.</hi> 26. The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> is also manifest by Reason and Experience. A National Church, so denominated, may have the Truth of Doctrine of Faith, the Truth of Worship, the Truth of Holy conversation; besides which, there is nothing essential to a true Church. For the defect of outward order, were the order pretended indeed of Christs Institution, yet could not nullifie the Church, or destroy the Truth of it, but only the regularity. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were a true Church 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. even then when there were disorders in their Meeting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. in their Discipline, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, 2. in their Communion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21. in their Faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.12. in their Conversation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. and 12.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. As for the outward form of their Combination by a Church Covenant, or their number, or their habitation, or their descent; these and such like things, though for convenience they be requisite, yet not essential to the Church or its Truth. Yea, the having of Baptism, Organizing by Officers, though more necessary and of Divine Institution, yet are not essential to a Church or its Truth; but that the Church without them, may be a true Church, though not so regular and well ordered as it should be. Nor doth the having of National Rulers Ecclesiastical, either single persons, or in a Synod or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, make a false Church. Those of the Congregational way have had Synods, and submitted to Courts even in Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical things of larger extent than a Congregation of one Town, and Churches of a greater number, and at greater distance of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation than could meet in one place every Lords Day for all Ordinances, and deny not a Catholick visible Church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should not by reason of the number, distance, want of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Divine Institution, or because modelled by humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, call a National Church, a false Church. The proofs used by those that held, that <hi>many particular Congregations may be under one Presbyterial Government,</hi> Printed in the Year 1645. from the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100176:25"/>
number of the Church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>; yet one Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1. under one Government, besides what is found in the Scripture about the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Ephesus,</hi> are sufficient to evince, that many Congregations may be one Church; and that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and truth of Churches, is to be taken from agreement and verity of Faith: and that a National Church, so denominated, in respect of the agreement in profession, or subjection to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or convention by Deputies or Messengers in one Synod, may be one National Church, and a true Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>But it is objected, That the first Church is of Christs Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that was of so many as might meet in one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that was numerous before the dispersion, yet might meet together in one Assembly; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2. <hi>When the twelve called the multitude of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples unto them</hi> about the election of Deacons.</p>
               <p>To this it is answered, 1. That in St. <hi>Luke</hi> there are many places where <hi>the multitude</hi> with an universal sign] is not to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for every one, not one exempted, as <hi>Luke</hi> 8.37. <hi>Acts</hi> 25.24. when it is said that <hi>all the multitude of the Disciples began to rejoyce, Luke</hi> 19.37. it is to be limited to those that were present. And so in this place, and <hi>Act.</hi> 16.12, 30. and 21.22. As in many the like expressions, all sorts of Authors are to be interpreted, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by <hi>the multitude,</hi> and <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>the whole multitude, City, Company,</hi> of such a number as might be reputed as the whole. Now it is not likely that there was one place fit for that business, which could receive the whole number of the Disciples then at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so as to place them orderly for the hearing and debate of that business, for which they met, and, the multitudes being of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as well as Men, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.14. it is not likely every Woman was called to that Meeting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But were it granted that they then met for that business, yet there is no likelyhood they met for all Ordinances. For though it be said, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.12. that <hi>they were all with one accord in</hi> Solomons <hi>porch,</hi> and <hi>they continued daily with one accord in the Temple</hi>; yet they did <hi>break bread from house to house, Acts</hi> 2.46.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> though the first Church, cannot be said to be the pattern of all Churches, sith it was not with any distribution of Believers under particular Pastors, nor at that time had any fixed Officers, but was to be <hi>surcularis Ecclesia,</hi> that Church from whence were to be taken such as might plant other Churches, for which end they were after dispersed, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1.4.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:100176:25"/>4. This disposition of that Church, we find not to have been by any institution of precept, which should make a certain rule to us about the fashioning and setling of Churches: But these things came to pass according to Divine Promises and Providence, which being so various, as that no certain rule can be accommodated to all times, places, and estates of the Church of God, we may judge, that Christ hath left the shaping of Churches much to Humane Prudence, the ends of Christian Assemblies and Societies being observed.</p>

But this is rather true of the Universal Church, and mystical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, as may be gathered from 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12, 13. in that <hi>by one spirit</hi> Christians <hi>are all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Gentiles, Bond or Free</hi>; and from <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.22, 23. where the <hi>Church, which is the Body of Christ the Head, is the fulness of Him that filleth all in all; Eph.</hi> 4.4. <hi>there is one Body, and one Spirit</hi>; then of the first Church, that is the first visible Church, which he makes a particular Congregation, such as that at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was. And it is true of this Church, he is so accurate a Former, as that he fashions the Dimensions of it. <hi>He is the Head, from whom the whole Body, fitly joyned together, and compacted by every joynt of supply, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the Body unto the edifying of it self in love, Eph.</hi> 4.15. Yet this is not without the use of men, <hi>for the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ; till we all come in the unity of Faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, v.</hi> 12.13. So that it cannot be said, that no more is left to man about circumscribing the Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of this Body; much less, that nothing more is left to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100176:26"/>
prudence about circumscribing the dimensions of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, universal, national, or parochial, than was to the making of mans body in the first creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is but a Rhetorical flourish from a similitude, in which though there be an agreement thus farr, that Christ is the alone framer of his Church, in respect of its inward form by the operation of his spirit; yet it is not so in respect of the outward forme, but that much of it is left to the ordering of men, as Divine providence shall guide them, and circumstances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>The rest of his arguing is of like sort. <hi>Again, Each first Church of God is the house and building of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9. Heb. 3.3.4. 1 Tim. 3.15. <hi>And what prudent housholder will permit the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure or quantity of his house, to the arbitrement, and will of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answer, It is true, the Church of God, not only the universal, or particular Church, but also each believer is the house of God, not a material, but, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. a <hi>spiritual house,</hi> and it is true, that it is God that builds this house, and that Christ is the only foundation, and yet others are subordinate builders and foundations, whereof some are Master builders, and wiser than other after workmen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. and foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too in respect of their doctrine, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.20. And to these builders or foundations, though the faith and doctrine, upon, and by which they are to be built, is not left to mens will and choice, yet many things pertaining to the outward figure and quantity, that is the distributing of Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Oecumenical, National, Classical, Parochial; and the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of meetings for their edifications with many things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to good order and decent behaviour, are left under general rules to be observed, to the prudence of governours of Gods house.</p>
               <p>But we have more of the like stuffe. <hi>What? The corporal temple had its dreadth, and its measure described most accurately by God, shall not the spiritual have its? Wherefore then was that reed given to</hi> John? <hi>Wherefore a command to measure the Temple</hi> Rev. 11.1:</p>
               <p>Answer, Each believer is <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. and 6.19. and this is as true of each Houshold Church, as of each Congregational Church, and it is true, that God hath by his providence <hi>described the Spiritual Temple as well as the Corporal,</hi> but he hath not given to us any such description of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100176:26"/>
outward fashion, and order the breadth and measure, that is the number, situation, disposition of the parts of the Spiritual Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as he did to <hi>Moses, David, Soloman, Ezra,</hi> or others of the Material Temple. A <hi>reed was indeed given to</hi> John, <hi>and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to measure the Temple of God,</hi> Revel. 11.1. but not that <hi>John</hi> should set down the figure or quantity of each particular visible Church, or the number of persons, that are to belong to one visible Church, their nearness or remoteness of their dwelling one to another, the choice of meeting places, and of Ministers to them fixed or unfixed: these and such like things were never done by St. <hi>John,</hi> nor do Mr. <hi>Brightmans</hi> words cited by Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port he did, but St. <hi>Johns measuring of the Temple</hi> was his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the extent of it, that is, how large or how narrow the Church should be in after times, in what estate of peace or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, what accidents should happen to it, as Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> and others do conceive, in order to the fulfilling of that Prophesying, which by eating the little Book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.10, 11, he was assigned to. As for Mr. <hi>Brightmans</hi> words, (though they be not an oracle yet) they may be granted without any detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the thing I assert. For though it be true, as he saith, <hi>that the true Christian Church is shadowed by the type of the Old Temple, of which the several parts were of old most accurately described and measured by the command of God:</hi> to wit <hi>that men might know that this house was made by God, that it is not of humane structure: and therefore that men should not take upon themselves any whit to change things at their pleasure, as if the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wisdome had not sufficiently provided concerning the most commodious manner of each thing</hi>; yet it might be true, which I assert, that God hath not determined the distribution and order of particular Churches so, but that he hath left many things therein to humane prudence. But Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> addes some thing more. <hi>What was the visible Church of the Jewes, when that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was called to the faith?</hi> Rev. 21.15. <hi>moreover he who spake with me,</hi> saith John, <hi>had a golden Reed, that he might measure the City and the Gates of it, and the Wall of it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that will neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect no part of the Jewish Church, but designe most diligently the quantity, longitude, latitude, hatr he cast off all care of our Church, so as that he hath negligently left it's dimension to humane plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure?</hi> Further, <hi>let it be marked in this last example of Divine care and wisdome, that the Church is compared to a City: And is any City so negligently administred by men, that no regard is had of limits and bounds?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100176:27"/>Answer, That <hi>the holy City, the New</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>descending from God out of Heaven, as a Bride prepared and adorned for her Husband, is the visible Church of the Jewes, when that Nation was, or shall be called to the Faith,</hi> or that <hi>the measuring the City and</hi> the <hi>Gates of it, and the wall of it</hi> was to design the quantity of particular Churches, or the frame and order of a particular Congregation as the first visible Church, is scarce probable. To me such kinde of arguments as are framed from <hi>Jewish</hi> Church State, from their rites, and ceremonial worship to inferre duties, priviledges, and orders about the Christian visible Church-state, government and rites are of no force, as savouring more of fancy than of judgment, if Christ or his Apostles have not made those arguments before us. Yet, if any such argument were of weight, sith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>would not have us ignorant of this mistery, that blindness in part is hapned to</hi> Israel, <hi>untill the fulness of the Gentiles be come in, and so all</hi> Israel <hi>shall be saved: as it is written, there shall come out of</hi> Sion <hi>the deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from</hi> Jacob, I might better argue for a national Church of Gods institution from the visible Church-state of the Jewes at their future cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, than for a Congregational Church. But I count neither firme, nevertheless, if God do design more diligently the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity longitude, and latitude of the Jewish Church at their calling hereafter, and leave the dimension of our Church to humane choice, this may be done out of more special Love to them, who are in a peculiar manner <hi>beloved by reason of the Fathers, Rom.</hi> 11.28. and not out of negligence, nor so as to have cast off all care of our Church. And though the Church be compared to a City, <hi>the Heavenly</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. yet it may agree well with Gods wisdome, and care to leave many things to the prudence of the present governours, concerning the distincton of Churches, and order of meetings; as it may suite well with the wisdome and care of a good Prince, who in his charter of incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating a City, sets down what Officers they shall have, and what jurisdiction they shall exercise, yet leaves it to the choice of some one or more to order their Companies, meetings, and many particularities of their government as shall be found most Convenient for them. From this disgression in answer to Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> I return to our Author.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, He enquires <hi>whether there can be a true Ministry in a false Church,</hi> which he supposeth a national Church to be as not of Divine institution, and consequently the Ministry of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in that it is the Ministry of a national Church, cannot be a true Ministry. Before the query be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it is necessary, that it be considered what is the Ministry of which it is enquired, whether it be true or false; what is the Ministry in a Church, and the falsehood of the Church, which may be a cause of the falsehood of the Ministry. For explication whereof we are to observe. 1 That <hi>the Ministry</hi> is all one with the imployment of a Minister, and a [<hi>Minister</hi>] is a Latin word answering to <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, from whence comes the English word [Deacon] and notes the office of one, reaching to another that which he wants, or doth any other act whereby he gratifies or helps another, and it is for the most part the work of a servant, and implies inferiority, whence those speeches of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.26. <hi>he that is chief as he that serveth, Mat</hi> 23.11. <hi>he that is the greatest of you shall be your Servant or Minister, Mat.</hi> 20.29. <hi>the Son of Man came not to be ministred to, but to Minister,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to acts which imply no inferiority of condition, but free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or readiness, as it is said, that when <hi>some women ministred to Christ of their substance, Luke</hi> 8.3.

                  </gap> is oft restrained to the office of a Deacon, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. But the Ministry we are enquiring of, is neither that of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that waits on his Master, nor of a contributor that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth anothers wants of outward necessaries, nor the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the function of a Magistrate, by doing acts of publique justice, nor the ministry of Christ, which was, and is peculiar to him, nor the Ministry of Angels, who are also termed <hi>Gods

Ministers</hi> and <hi>Ministring Spirits, Heb.</hi> 1.7, 14. Nor the office of Deacons as their office is termed <hi>serving tables</hi> distinct from <hi>the Ministry of the word, Acts.</hi> 6.1, 2, 4.

Now this Ministry is usually expressed by <hi>the Ministry of the word,</hi> Acts 6.4. <hi>the Ministry of the Gospel of God,</hi> Rom. 15.16. <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the New Testament, not of the letter but of the Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 8. <hi>of righteousness,</hi> v. 9. <hi>the Ministry of reconciliation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Stewards of the Misteris of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1. and sometimes <hi>our Ministery</hi> without any other adjunct, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. and <hi>an Oeconomy,</hi> or <hi>dispensation,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. more fully, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. <hi>the Ministery, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the grace of God.</hi> Which shewes the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Ministry, whereupon he requires, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Let a man so account of us as of the Mynisters</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100176:28"/>
were of God, and Christ Jesus) but for the Church, or Saints, as the subjects to and for whom he was appointed <hi>to fulfill the word of God, even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations, but then was made manifest to his Saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you the hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, v.</hi> 26, 27. to which purpose he speaks also of himself, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.6, 7, 8, 9. which yet is not to be restrained so to the Saints, but that the Ministry of the Gospel was to be to them that were not Saints, <hi>I am a debtor,</hi> saith he, Rom. 1.14. <hi>both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, both to the wise and to the unwise,</hi> and 1 Cor. 1.23. <hi>We preach Christ unto the Jewes a stumbling block, and unto the Greeks foolishness,</hi> and 2 Cor. 2.14, 15. <hi>Thanks be to God which alwayes causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place. For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish.</hi> So that the Ministry of the word though it be primarily for the Church and the Saints, yet is the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospel the Ministry of Christ, even to unbelievers, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was a <hi>Prophet to the rebellious Nation of</hi> Israel, <hi>when he spake Gods word, whether they did hear or forbear,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 2.5. And hence I inferre that there may be a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry not only in, but also out of a Church of believers.</p>

                  <hi>Sect. 19.</hi> A true Gospel Ministry may be in a false Church so deemed.</head>
               <p>Secondly, A Church may be said to be false many wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it was irregularly constituted, that is not gathered by consent, or Church-covenant, or baptism, but by humane Laws, in forcing men to meet together in one Congregation, or more; because dwellers in such a Precinct, or born or living in such a Countrey. In this respect I conceive the Quaerist makes a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church a false Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because it is an hypocritical company, which doth indeed make them a false Church before God, yet <hi>quoad nos</hi> they are a true visible Church, if there be no falsehood in that which is descernible by men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Because it is Schismatical, so as to break off from other parts of the Catholique Church, without a justifiable cause, whether out of ambition, passion, misapprehension or any other such like undue motive.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because it is heretical, or Heresy is broached and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by a party in it. Now I confess, that it can hardly be, that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100176:29"/>
there should be a true Ministry in a Church tainted with Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy. Yet sith our Lord Christ, writes to the Church of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> as one of his seven Golden Candlesticks, though there were <hi>that held the Doctrin of</hi> Balaam <hi>and of the</hi> Nicolaitans, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.14, 15. and in like manner the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> or the Angel of it <hi>suffered the Woman which called her self a Prophetess, to teach and seduce his Servants to commit Fornication, and to eat things Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to Idols.</hi> I inferre those Angels were true Ministers, though in a Church in some sort false, that is, tainted with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical or false doctrin. And sith the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was manifestly Schismatical, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11, 12. Yet <hi>Apollos</hi> a true Minister to them, or who else were their Pastors. And sith the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> is charged, <hi>as having a name that it lived but was dead,</hi> yet the Angel of it, one of the seven Stars in Christs right hand, then may there be a true Ministry in such false Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.1. that is schismatical, or hypocritical not consisting of real Saints. And if it be, that what is charged on <hi>Laodicea, Rev.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. were by reason of defect in Church constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and disciplin (as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> conceived) then also a false Church, in respect of such irregularity may have a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. But because this is only an argument <hi>ad homines,</hi> to such as concurre with Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> in his conceit; I will prove, that in a National Church, or a Church irregular in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution or discipline, miscalled false, may be a true Ministry of Christ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the truth of the Ministry depend upon the truth of the Church or it's regularity, then where is no true regular Church, there is no true Ministry. But that is false, sith there may be a true Ministry, where there is no Church at all, and therefore no true Church. Ergo, the truth of the Ministry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not on the truth of the Church: but a true Ministry may be in a false Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If there be a true Ministry, though to or in a National visible Church or Catholique, then that extent, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be inconsistent with a true Gospel Church, makes not the Ministry false, but <hi>Peters</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> Ministry to the Jews or Gentiles Churches, were true Ministries, though the Churches were National or Catholique, even <hi>set by God in the Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.18. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If Ministry to Churches Hypocritical, Schismatical, and in some sort Heretical may be true Ministry, much more to a Church National, irregular in constitution and discipline,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100176:29"/>
those being greater degrees of falsehood than this. But the antecedent is before proved from the Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to the Churches of <hi>Pergamos, Thyatira,</hi> and <hi>Sardis; Ergo</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is true.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the regular constitution, disciplin of the Church, the election of the Church or their sending be extrinsecal or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, not necessary, or essential to the truth of the Ministry, then may there be a true Ministry in such a Church as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor calls false. But the antecedent is true, sith the Apostles were true Ministers, afore the regular constitution and discipline of Churches, without their Election or mission, therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is also true.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the denomination of true Ministers be from the truth of their Doctrin, and no other form denominating them, and there may be a Ministration of true Doctrin in such a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed false Church, then there may be a true Ministry in such a false Church, for where the form denominating is, there the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is rightly denominated from it. But the antecedent is true, both from all the Texts before alledged, which place the truth of Ministry in the Doctrin taught, and no other thing, and in that the <hi>Colossians learned the grace of God in truth, from</hi> Epaphras <hi>he</hi> is termed <hi>St.</hi> Pauls <hi>Fellow-Servant, and for them a faithfull Minister of Christ,</hi> Col. 1.6, 7. and reason and experience confirms the possibility of preaching true Doctrin in a National mis-called false Church, therefore the consequent is also true.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If false Prophets, false Apostles, false Brethren be only deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from their false Doctrin, then they are not false Ministers but true, who teach the truth of the Gospel, notwithstanding their defects, or the Churches in which they are.

                  <hi>Sect. 20.</hi> Gods love to us is not less, in not determining the whole of his Worship to us, as to the Jews.</head>
               <p n="3">3. Saith he, <hi>Whether God doth not bear as much love to, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise as much faithfulness over his New Testament Churches, as over the National Church of the Jews</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No doubt of it: yet doth not God shew his love, nor exercise his faithfulness over his New Testament Churches in the same way or course of Providence as he did, and perhaps, will do over the National Church of the Jews. He doth not gather the New Testament Churches by a mighty hand, and a stretched-out arm; as he did, when he brought <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moses</hi>; but by the calling of his Word, and operation of his Spirit. Nor doth he make them Conquerours by Arms; but they <hi>overcome the old Serpent by the blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of their Testimony, and they love not their lives unto the death, Rev.</hi> 12.11. Nor doth God now settle his Church in one fruitful Land, under one earthly King, as he did the <hi>Jews</hi> under <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>; but in all Countries, where they are called; protects, and feeds them by the Great Shepherd of the Sheep, the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ, and his Spirit, in that estate and station, wherein they are called. Nor is it improbable, that in the future calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> God will shew more remarkable Providences, for their re-ingraffing into their own Olive, than ever he hath yet shewed towards the Churches of the Gentiles,</p>
               <p>It is added. <hi>If so, then</hi> 4. <hi>Whether he hath not (as of old he did, with reference unto the then Church) determined the whole of the Worship, appertaining unto them, to whose Institutions, without any Humane additions, it is the duty of souls solely to conform?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The whole of the Worship appertaining to the New Testament Churches, is either inward or outward. To the New Testament Churches, God hath determined the whole of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worship, as of old he did, with reference unto the then Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch; or rather, he hath more fully determined the Worship of himself, by exercise of Faith, and hope in Prayer and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, having now more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> opened the mystery of his Will, in the way of access to him, and accepting of our service; than he did to the <hi>Jews</hi> before Christs coming. But for the outward Worship, though he have set down sufficiently what we are to place his Worship in, and wherein he hath determined by Precept or Example; that hath the force of a Precept, what is to be done
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100176:30"/>
by us; that alone we are to account his Worship, and to conform solely to it as his Institution, without any Humane Additions or Alterations; yet in respect of Circumstantials, such as are, Time, Place, Meetings, Order in Doing, and the like, God hath not determined the whole of the outward Worship appertaining to the New Testament Churches, as of old he did with reference to the then Church; but hath left such things (though needful to the well performing of the Worship he hath determined) under ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules prescribed in holy Scripture, to be set down by men, who are Governours; to whom obedience is due in order to the end of their directions, though not with equal tie of Conscience, as to Divine Institutions. Nor doth God hereby bear less love, or exercise less faithfulness over his New Testament Churches, than he did over the National Church of the <hi>Jews</hi>; but rather more:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because the determination of the whole of the Worship of God to the National Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> was the imposing of <hi>a yoke on them, which neither the elder nor later Jews were able to bear, Acts</hi> 15.10. and therefore God shewed more love, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised more faithfulness over his New Testament Churches, in not determining the whole of his Worship in Circumstantials, as he did to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The determination of the whole of Gods Worship to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in Circumstantials of outward Worship, did bring in many things which were <hi>unprofitable, and weak, and made nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, Heb.</hi> 7.18, 19. And if God had so determined to us, he had commanded things <hi>unprofitable, weak, which made nothing perfect</hi>; therefore he shewed more love and faithfulness to us, in not so determining.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The things God had determined to the <hi>Jews</hi> about the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantials and Rituals of his Worship, were but <hi>shadows of good things to come,</hi> which were not fit to be continued, or to be supplied with any other, Christ being come, who was the <hi>Body,</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. Therefore God in not determining such things to us, hath shewed more love and faithfulness.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Such Ordinances were <hi>carnal,</hi> to endure only <hi>until the time of Reformation</hi>; therefore it is a part of Gods love and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that neither the same in particular, nor other, are precisely determined to us by God, this time of the Gospel, being the <hi>time of Reformation, Heb</hi> 9.9, 10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God so determined the whole of his Worship to the <hi>Jews,</hi> because they were in their Minority, and therefore were to be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100176:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kept under those <hi>weak and beggerly Elements of the World, as under Tutors, and Governours, until the time appointed of the Father, Gal.</hi> 4 1, 2, 3, 9. But the Christian Believers are as sons come to age, and therefore fit to be released of them, and such like; and to be at more liberty in these things, than they were before, <hi>v.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The time before Christs coming, was an estate under <hi>Moses a Servant</hi>; but now the estate of Christians is under <hi>Christ the Son, Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6, 7 <hi>Heb</hi> 3.5, 6. Therefore our freedom from such determinations as were upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> is more congruous, than to have them imposed on us; and consequently, a sign of more love in God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If such determinations of the whole of Gods Worship had been to us, as were to the Jews, we had not reaped the fruit of Christs death, by which he did <hi>abolish them, Eph.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. and consequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ntly, had tasted less of the love of God than we have; if the same, or such precise determinations of the whole of Gods Worship, had been continued to us.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Apostles judged it a great benefit to the Christian Churches, that they were exempt from them; and <hi>it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to them, to lay upon the Churches no greater burden, than those necessary things,</hi> mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28, 29. therefore they counted it an effect of Gods love, that he had not determined the whole of his Worship to us, as he did to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. This yields us also another reason why it is an effect of Gods greater love to the Gentile Churches, that he hath not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them the whole of his Worship, as he did to the Jews; because those Gentile Christians being of divers Nations and Languages under divers Governments, used to divers Customs, could not conveniently, if at all, practice such an uniformity of Circumstances, as they must have done if God had determined the whole of his Worship, as he did to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 To averr that God hath determined the whole of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worship in Circumstantials, as he did to the <hi>Jews,</hi> is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe our Christian liberty, and to bring us into such bondage as they were in, who were under the Law; which is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that love which God hath born to the New Testament Churches, and the New Covenant, which he hath made under the Gospel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.20, 21, 24.

                  <hi>Yea,</hi> 5. <hi>Whether he hath not now (as then) designed the several Officers and Offices, his wisdom thought sufficient for the management of the affairs of his house; so that the invention of new ones by the sons of men, is not only needless, but a daring advance against the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, care, and wisdom of God over his Churches?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. God did, besides <hi>Moses</hi> and the seventy Elders, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah</hi> and the <hi>Judges, David</hi> and other <hi>Kings,</hi> for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> and Prophets raised up, as he thought good, for special purposes; design <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons, and the <hi>Levites</hi> for the Services of the Tabernacle, and Temple. But he hath not designed such Officers or Offices, as either <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sanhedrin, <hi>David</hi> or the <hi>Judges</hi>; or as the Priests and Levites, and their Services, were for the management of the affairs of his House; that is, the Christian Church; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods design not to gather this Church, or to form it in that way and Government, as he did the <hi>Jewish.</hi> Christ did not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Church, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were by <hi>Moses</hi> brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi>; nor were erected into the form of a Political Body, but of a School; without either infringing the power of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> and their Officers; or withdrawing the People from the Officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Temple, though corrupt. If any advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or others into Offices, from the Pattern of the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Priesthood or Services; as the Papists, who will have their Pope to be Universal Supreme Bishop, in correspondence to the High Priest of the Jews; to be absolutely obeyed, as he was in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrium</hi>; to be infallible in his determinations, to have power of adjudging to death for Heresie; to make sacrificing Priests for Quick and Dead, in imitation of the Levitical Priests. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the invention of such new ones by Papists, or any other of the sons of men; is not only needless, but a <hi>daring advance against the Soveraignty, Care, and Wisdom of God over his Churches</hi>; the Temple, and the Priesthood thereof, being now by God taken away.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath designed by his Son and his Apostles, the several Officers and Offices his Wisdom thought sufficient for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the affairs of his House, that is, his Church, as they are such. First, Christ <hi>Jesus called his twelve Disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all Devils, and to cure Diseases; and he sent them to preach the Kingdom of God, and to

heal the sick,</hi> Luke 9.1, 2. <hi>After he appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face, into every City and place, whither he himself would come</hi>; and these were confined to <hi>the lost sheep of the house of Israel,</hi> Mat. 10.6. <hi>To whom</hi> (he saith) <hi>only he was sent,</hi> Mat. 15.24. St. <hi>Peter</hi> having confessed him, Christ tells him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church</hi>; which by reason of the repeating of his Name, and alluding to it, and thereby minding him of it, is justly to be thought to imply a promise of a special use of him, in the building of his Church; not barely as that particular man, but as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it by his Preaching; as other Apostles are called <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, Eph.</hi> 2.20. in respect of their Doctrine, wherein St. <hi>Peter</hi> had some work before the other in his Preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and 3. and 10. And therefore Christ promiseth <hi>to give him the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat.</hi> 16.19. So as by his preaching to open the Kingdom of Heaven, first to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when <hi>Cornelius</hi> was admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven; and therefore <hi>Act.</hi> 15.7. he speaks of it as his prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that <hi>God made choice among the Disciples, that the Gentiles by his mouth should hear the Word of the Gospel, and believe</hi>; he imploying <hi>that key of knowledge, which the Lawyers had taken away; who entered not themselves into the Kingdom of God, and them that were entering in, they hindered,</hi> Luke 11.52. To him our Lord Christ assures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.</hi> Which Phrase seems by the <hi>expressions, Mat.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Rev</hi> 2.24. to import, that what he should command to be done, should be in Heaven ratified, as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God; as it was <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.48. and <hi>what he should untie,</hi> that is, free men from the obligation of, <hi>that should be untied in Heaven</hi>; that is, God would not require the observation of it: which was performed <hi>Acts</hi> 11.3, 14, 17, 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. Which promises, though personal to St. <hi>Peter</hi>; and in respect of the first work, peculiar to him; neither imparted to any other Apostle, nor derived from him to any successour: yet this last promise was after made to the rest of the Apostles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. and performed when St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with them, decreed about Circumcision, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.24. and the Holy Ghost established it, <hi>v.</hi> 28. Afterwards our Lord Christ <hi>being risen from the dead, finds his Disciples assembled for fear of the Jews,</hi> Thomas <hi>being absent, and saith, Peace be unto you; as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you. And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100176:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose soever sins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they are remitted unto them, and whosesoever sins ye retain they are retained,</hi> John 20.19, 21, 22, 23. The words of salutation, of mission, the breathing on them, and imparting the Holy Ghost to them do import, that the remission and retaining of sins there promised, was a peculiar power given to them on whom he thus breathed, though also communicated after to other Apostles, who were in like manner sent, and received the Holy Ghost as they did. Which remission of sins was accomplished, when by their preaching, persons <hi>repented, and were Baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins,</hi> Acts 2.39, 41. <hi>When</hi> Aeneas <hi>was cured by St</hi> Peter, Acts, 9.33. For healing is by remission of sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.6. <hi>James</hi> 5.15. <hi>John</hi> 5.14. Or by taking off the sentence <hi>of delivering to Satan,</hi> by which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had power to retain sins, as appears by that speech of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.20. <hi>That he had delivered</hi> Hymenaeus <hi>and</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>unto Satan, that they might be instructed,</hi> or <hi>corrected, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, so as either to be afraid</hi> or disabled <hi>from blaspheming</hi> any more as they had done, when Satan should chastise them with bodily punishment, <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>also had determined by his Spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. When the</hi> Christians <hi>were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> that they might be witnesses, <hi>to deliver him that had his Fathers Wife unto Satan, for the destruction of the Flesh, that is</hi> the wasting of his body, <hi>that the Spirit</hi> or Soul being sensible of his sin and humbled for it, <hi>might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.3, 4, 5. Which had been his <hi>comming to them with a Rod,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.21. and the retaining his sin, had not his after-sorrow caused S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>forgive him in the person of Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.10. which was the remitting of sin, confirmed in Heaven. Other instances there are of the retaining of sins by Apostolical power, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> smote <hi>Elymas</hi> the sorcerer with blindness, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.11. and St. <hi>Peter</hi> inflicted death upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and his wife <hi>Sapphira, for lying to the Holy Ghost, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping back part of the price of the Land which they had sold,</hi> Acts 5.3, 5, 10. After this mission, commission, and breathing of Christ on the disciples, to reestablish St. <hi>Peter</hi> after his fall, Christ injoynes him <hi>to feed his Lambs</hi> and <hi>his Sheep,</hi> thrice char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him, that he might shew his love to him, whom he had thrice denied; whereby he doth not make him universal Bishop, or Monarch of the whole visible Church (as <hi>Romanists</hi> impiously pervert the Text) but requires of him diligence in testimony of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100176:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his love to him, by doing that work which is expressed in words, which signifie teaching (one of them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies not ruling) and that Ministry which is common to other Bishops, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and <hi>Elders,</hi> among whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> termes himself a <hi>fellow Elder,</hi> and Christ <hi>the chief Shepherd,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.1, 2, 4. But then Christ did most design the Officers and Offices, he thought requisite for the management of the affairs of his house, when being to ascend into Heaven, not long after, in a mountain of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee Jesus spake to them, saying, all power is given unto me in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth, go ye therefore, and teach all Nations,</hi> or rather <hi>Disciple</hi> or <hi>make Disciples all Nations,</hi> or, <hi>of,</hi> or, <hi>in all Nations,</hi> not the Jewes, only, as formerly, (<hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Gospel, to every creature,</hi> or, <hi>to all the creation) Baptizing them,</hi> thus discipled, (<hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is Baptized shall be saved) into the name of the the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world,</hi> Amen. <hi>In which instruction of the Apostles, is founded the function of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Ministry,</hi> as <hi>Pareus</hi> speaks in his <hi>Commentary, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Preaching the Gospel and Baptizing and teaching the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Christs commands</hi>; which Offices, the promise <hi>to be with them all dayes to the end of the World,</hi> shewes to be perpetual till Christs second coming. Who the Officers are of Christs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing may be best gathered from, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11. Some of which are undoubtedly to continue. And that there should be a succession by ordination of some for the Churches is apparent from, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. and that they should be ordained, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2.3. and 14.23. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. and 5.22. that there should be some, who should have inspection over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they do not sow errours, or otherwise corrupt the Churches, may be granted from, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10.11. and by the things charged on the seven Angels of the seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 6, 14, 15, 16, 20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2, 3, 15, 16, 19. To set down the History of Officers and Offices in after-ages, to determin the disputes, about their several degrees or orders is full of difficulty, and to our present business unnecessary. This only is sufficient for present, to say in answer to the question now under hand, That such as do these works which Christ or his Apostles have appointed to be performed for his Church are Officers designed by Christ, and their ordination thereto agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his design, nor are those <hi>Officers or Offices an invention

The solemn deputation of Apostles and other Ministers of the Gospel, we finde not to have been the peculiar priviledg of the body of the Church in any part of the New Testament.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how unquiet, in judicious, deceitful, factious, divided those are that usurp the name of Saints, and perhaps are, I see not how safe it were to commit the solemn deputation of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to them without much regulation of them, and ability of discerning of Spirits, which is not a gift continued to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who oft are as easily deceived by hypocrites and seducers, as others, and if it were the peculiar priviledg of Saints, it were not to be denied to women, contrary to the Apostles rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33, 34. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.11, 12. If it were such a peculiar priviledg to Saints, to ordain or choose their Ministers, so as they were not to own any, but whom they choose, then the lesser part of a Congregation were not bound to take him for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who is not chos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Answer, I grant that no particular Church visible, whether National, Provincial, Classical, Parochial, or Congregational hath greater security of Apostacy from God than the Jewish, and that any such Church may be so overspread with corruptions, that it may lose the essence of a Church, and justly be disrobed of that appellation, we justly plead against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pleading [that <hi>they are the Church built on</hi> Peter, <hi>against which the Gates of Hell shall not prevail Mat.</hi> 16.18.] that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is not to that or any other particular visible Church, but to the invisible Church of Gods elect, and we alledg that St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> tells them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20, 21. <hi>well, because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith: be not high minded, but fear.

               </p>
               <p>Answer, Compulsion of men may be cruelty.

               <p>AS a preamble to his dispute, the Author writes thus. <hi>This is that which the Lord hath said, I will be sanctified in all that draw nigh me, and before all the people will I be glorified. The great care of Saints in matter of worship, is to sanctifie the name of the Lord therein: This is the great thing that God looks at, the omission where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the often severely punishes, he children of men for: now in order hereunto, it's necessary that in all our approaches to God we see to the institution of the Lord, both in respect of the matter, and manner of worship, that it be according to Divine prescript, else we cannot sanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fy the name of God therein, nor glorify him before the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answer, This is yielded, that wherein God hath prescribed it is necessary we see to the institution of the Lord both in respect of the matter and manner of worship, even to determined par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities: but in those things which are not determined by God, yet it is requisite they should be some way determined by our selves or others, we and they are not so limited, but that keeping to general rules there may be liberty of variation, and there may be too anxious care, tending to beget unnecessary scruples, perplexities, divisions and censurings, even in and of Saints, which experience hath too much proved to cause fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in mens minds, and inconstancy in their practice; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a brood of Seekers, Quakers, Ranters, and prophane A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists. For which reason it is very advisable, that persons of good meaning, but weak judgments did less busie themselves in questioning such undetermined particularities in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and were received, <hi>but not to doubtfull disputations, Rom</hi> 14.1. and did satisfy themselves in such things by preferring the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their faithful, learned, wise and holy Teachers and Rulers before their own, when their own capacity is insufficient to settle their Consciences. He proceeds thus, <hi>Hearing (as was said, and shall beyond contradictions in its proper place be evinced) is part of instituted worship, it therefore more nearly concerns Saints than many are aware of, to have their consciences resolved from the Scriptures of God, in the matter under enquiry, whether it be lawful for the Saints to hear the present Ministers of</hi> England?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100176:36"/>
                  <hi>'Tis the negative, which we have received under our maintenance, because we are satisfied Christ hath so; to the proof whereof we now address our selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answer, Of hearing, how it is a part of instituted worship, somewhat hath been said in the answer to the preface, <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.2.3. what more is to be added, will come in it's proper place. I grant, that it concerns Saints to have their consciences resolved from the Scriptures of God in the matter under enquiry, and do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore joyn issue with this Author, and whereas he <hi>denies it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Saints to hear the present Ministers of</hi> England, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in their teaching of the Doctrins of faith and holiness according to that which is authorized in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I affirm it, and address my self to the examination of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors arguments.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Argument 1. Is thus, <hi>That which there is no warrant for in the Scripture, being part of instituted worship, is not lawful for the Saints to practise: but there is no warrant in the Scripture for hearing the present Ministers of</hi> England, <hi>and hearing is part of instituted worship. Therefore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answer, The term [warrant] being a Law term, notes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an injunction requiring that a thing be done, but also an allowance or permission of a thing to be done with impunity or without blame, and either way the thing warranted is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Instituted worship (as is before shewed) is either moral or meerly positive and ceremonial. Parts of instituted worship may be either subjective, if instituted worship be conceived as <hi>totum universale,</hi> an universal whole, and so hearing of the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> may be conceived either as one sort of instituted worship, or one individual of that sort, or parts of instituted worship may be integrant, if instituted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be conceived as an integral whole. I do not deprehend hearing of the present Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> is to be conceived as an integral part of instituted worship, sith it is one act, which without any other act is worship: or parts of instituted worship may be essential or accidental, instituted worship being conceived as an essential or accidental whole. Those are parts essential of instituted worship, without which it is not or is not rightly called instituted worship, those are accidental parts
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100176:37"/>
which may be present or absent, and yet the Worship be, or right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be, so called. These things being premised, for answer to this Argument, I lay down these Propositions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every sort or kind of Instituted Worship of God, hath war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the Scripture by precept of command if it be lawful.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Those things which are determined by God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n any part or sort of Instituted Worship of God, are to be counted Essential parts, so as that the omission or alteration of them, or any of them, makes the Worship not to be, or to be rightly so called, Worship of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Those things which are in this sense Essential parts, must have warrant in Scripture by precept express, or by just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Accidental parts, or adjuncts of Instituted Worship undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined are lawful, if they have warrant in Scripture by permission, so as that they are not contrary to any precept or rule in Scripture about such Worship.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hearing of the Word of God, is a sort or part of Gods Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worship.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is essential to it, that we hear it as Gods Word, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and good hearts, with attention and reverence, as being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Gods command.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is but accidental, as being undetermined by God, that we hear it from this or that person, and therefore needs not warrant in Scripture by command to make it lawful.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The hearing of the present Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> Preaching the Word of God, hath warrant in Scripture by permission, as being not contrary to any precept or rule in Scripture about such Worship. Searching, and reading the Scriptures as the Word of God, is a part or sort of Instituted Worship, and accordingly hearing it read. When God commanded <hi>the Levites to read the Law, and all Israel to hear it at the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release in the Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> Deut. 31.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. The reading by such persons, and hearing at that time, was an essential part of Worship; but <hi>Shaphans</hi> reading before <hi>Josiah,</hi> (2 Chron. 34.18.) and his hearing of it then, was a part of Instituted Worship accidental, because not determined by Command, but ordered by Providence, and yet warrantable by Permission: Gods command being not exclusive, so as to forbid any other but <hi>Levites</hi> to read it, or the <hi>Israelites</hi> to hear it read by others at other times, there being general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts requiring all to hear the Word of God at all times, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.1.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100176:37"/>
and even the light of Nature dictating this, That a message from God is to be heard whoever brings it, of which the King of <hi>Moab</hi> was sensible, <hi>Judg.</hi> 3.20. and the King of <hi>Niniveh, Jonah</hi> 3 6. In like manner, when Christ tells the seventy Disciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me</hi>; he doth not restrain hearers from hearing others who delivered the same truth: but the general speech, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.47. <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods words,</hi> warrants the hearing of Gods word. To the Argument I answer, That if the <hi>major</hi> be meant of warrant by command, and part accidental of Instituted Worship, it is denied, and the <hi>minor</hi> is denied in that branch, <hi>That there is no warrant in the Scripture for hearing the present Ministers of</hi> England. But let us view his proofs.</p>

                  <hi>The major (or first) Proposition</hi> (saith he) <hi>is evident,</hi> 1. <hi>From the nature of Instituted Worship, which consists in this, that it be of Divine Revelation; else whatsoever it is, it is not Instituted Worship.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is true concerning the kind or sort of Instituted Worship, and concerning the essential parts, those things, I mean, which are determined and necessary; but not true of accidentals, parts, or adjuncts of Worship undetermined; these may be from Men, and yet the worship be of God. If <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> had heard and believed the Roll which was dictated by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> he had worshiped God, though <hi>Jehudi</hi>'s reading were by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.21.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is true, that all those actions, in which is placed the Worship of God, having no appointment from God, but onely from men, are vain and fruitless, and so unlawful, and so much the Text alledged proveth: But this proveth not, that the Worship of God appointed by him is vain, fruitless, and unlawful, because of some adjuncts, or circumstances appointed by men, which God hath left undetermined. So though the receiving to hold Traditions of the Elders, and Dictates of Pharisees, as if they were of God, and God were worshiped by them, was vain, fruitless and so unlawful; yet the hearing of the Law of God
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100176:38"/>
read in the Synagogues, which we find not to have been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, but by the prudence and authority of Rulers, was lawful and approved, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.16, 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15, 27. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>If it be lawful to Conform to any one part of Instituted Worship, without warrant from Scripture, 'tis also lawful to Conform to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a third, the whole, which would banish Instituted Worship out of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The first consequence is granted, yet the later is not necessary; for though it be true, <hi>If it be lawful to Conform to any one part of Instituted Worship without warrant from Scripture, 'tis also lawful to Conform to another, a third, the whole</hi>; yet this <hi>would not banish Instituted Worship out of the world.</hi> For when <hi>the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, and all the Jews, except they washed their hands oft, eat not, holding the Tradition of the Elders, and when they came from the market, except they washed, they eat not. And many things there were, which they had received to hold, as the washing of cups and puts, brazen vessels and of tables, Mark</hi> 7.3, 4. Yet this did not banish the Instituted Worship of the Passeover, and other worship appointed by God to the Jews out of the world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>To assert, that it is lawful to conform to any part of Instituted Worship without warrant from Scripture, reflects sadly upon the wisdom and faithfulness of Christ: for either he was not wise enough to foresee, that such a part of worship was, or would be requisite, or had not faithfulness enough to reveal it, though the Scripture compares him to</hi> Moses <hi>for faithfulness, who revealed the whole will of God to the making of a pin in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It no way reflects, with any disparagement, upon the wisdom and faithfulness of Christ, to assert, that it is lawful to Conform to accidental parts, or rather adjuncts, or circumstances of Instituted Worship, without warrant from Scripture by express command; for though Christ was wise enough to foresee what parts of Worship were or should be requisite, and had faithfulness enough to reveal what God did require, and did make known by himself, or his Apostles, what kind of Worship should be observed by Christians, and what parts were essential or necessary to be observed, were determined in Scripture: yet many accidental things, adjuncts, or circumstances of that Instituted Worship, were left to the prudence, and authority of men, chiefly of Rulers, which the Lord foreseeing, that his Churches would be gathered out of many Nations of various Customs, Dispositions, Governments,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100176:38"/>
thought fit to be permitted to them, though he did restrain the <hi>Jews</hi> more strictly by <hi>Moses,</hi> which was their burthen, and it is our ease, that we have more liberty than they had: Christ was faithful as <hi>Moses,</hi> in that he revealed to us what was his Fathers will in spirituals, more clearly than <hi>Moses</hi>; but for externals, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed but few things, and those easie; in what else was to be added, he left it to be ordered under general rules, as it should be found convenient in after times. And to argue in this manner, if Christ did not appoint every accidental part of Instituted Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, he had failed in wisdom or faithfulness, and had come short of <hi>Moses,</hi> seems to me to be like their arguing, who in the Canon Law say, If Christ had not appointed an Universal Bishop to end Controversies, as there was an High-Priest among the <hi>Jews, Non satis discretus esset, He had not been discret enough,</hi> very presumptuously, if not blasphemously, shaping Christs wisdom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the model of our understanding; and injuriously to us, in bringing again Christian believers under that yoke of bondage, from which Christ hath freed them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>It pours out contempt upon the care of God over the New-Testament Churches (as if it were less to these, than to those under the Law) and the Oeconomy of the Gospel, as not so compleat as that of old, the whole of whose Worship, Orders and Ordinances (as was said) was bottom'd upon pure Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is before proved, in the Answer to the <hi>Preface, Sect.</hi> 20. that it pours no contempt upon the care of God over the New-Testament Churches, that the whole of Gods Worship, Orders, and Ordinances in circumstantials or accidentals, which are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to much variation in Churches of different Nations, are not bottom'd upon pure Revelation Divine, but in many things left to humane prudence: yea it is an effect of Gods love and care over the New-Testament Churches, that he hath not tied them in so many things to external rites and particularities of Instituted Worship, as he did the <hi>Jews</hi>: Nor is the Oeconomy of the Gospel less compleat, than that of old for this cause; but if I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. this reasoning is either the same, or every like that of the Philosophical, or Judaizing Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, to which the Apostles caution is opposed, telling them, that <hi>all fulness was in Christ, they were compleat in him without the tradition of men, or rudiments of the world</hi>; by which the Jewish Rites to be meant, is apparent from <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17, 20. <hi>Gal</hi> 4 3, 9.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The authority and use of the holy Scripture is delivered by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. that <hi>they were able to make</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy <hi>wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus, that they were profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished unto all good works.</hi> Whence is rightly deduced against the Romanists, the perfection and sufficiency of the Scripture without unwritten Traditions for all Doctrinals of Faith and Manners, and Worship, in respect of Essentials. But it is no ill reflection upon its authority, to say that some accidentals of instituted Worship undetermined in Scripture, ordered by men according to general Rules in Scripture, are warranted by permission, without command of those particularities in holy Scripture.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100176:41"/>
which are usually produced for the abetting of the practice of some in this matter. For though Ministers be as bad as <hi>Judas,</hi> yet they may be heard preach the Gospel, as he was; and though the places alledged should prove insufficient for what they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, yet is not the <hi>Minor</hi> proved, till the sin be shewed, which is committed by hearing the present Ministers, (for <hi>where there is no Law</hi> forbidding, <hi>there is no transgression, Rom.</hi> 4.15.) and not People affrighted, by filling them with unnecessary scruples; nor divided one from another upon such suggestions, as this Writing yields; nor drawn to separations and oppositions, which tend to the undoing of men in their Estates, hinder the publick Peace, and the furtherance of the Gospel. To prevent which it little avails, that this Author acquaints us with his motive in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this piece. For though all he sayes of himself were true (as Charity binds me to believe it to be) yet it serves only to create prejudice in the minds of well-meaning People, who are led more by the opinion they have of the Writer, than by the strength of his Arguments; and for the most part hinders the impartial search for truth, and makes men adhere faster to a party. We know the opinion that was had of the holiness of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> was the greatest stumbling-block to the Jews against Christs Doctrine; and the opinion of the holiness of Monks, was the great furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Popish Superstition and Idolatry; and the opinion of many Teachers, hath bred many Errours; of which I gave warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many years since, in a little Treatise, Entituled, <hi>Anthropola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 3.21. foreseeing (as it hath come to pass) that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in Teachers would be the mischief of the Churches; from which it is time to take off People, and to make them more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and serious in examining what is said on both sides; as the Apostle admonisheth us, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5 21. Nevertheless I doubt not but in the progress of this dispute, I shall shew Scripture warrant for hearing the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> that preach the Gospel, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the objections against them; and accordingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in answering this Writing, that I may promote Truth and Peace, which is my aim, however I be censured; hoping that in time God will direct honest-hearted persons to unlearn that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous course of esteeming <hi>res ex personis,</hi> things by persons, and give over that evil custom of too many, who speak for, or against opinions, or practices, according to the affection they bear to men; and have no other argument why they refuse a thing, but this; that good people, as they judge them, are against it; nor why they adhere to it, but because they are for it. Which is in effect to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100176:42"/>
make them their Masters, contrary to Christs Prerogative, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.10. and in some sort idolizing of them.

Because the disjunction is of terms not opposite, but coincident; the same persons may be and are both Ministers of the Gospel, and Gifted Brethren, and may be heard under both considerations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The disjunction is not full, sith a third member may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, that they may be heard, as preaching, or declaring the Word of God, or speaking the truth of the Gospel: which is the only consideration requisite to the Hearer to be respected in Hearing.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:100176:42"/>1. Because God hath forbidden hearing of none, but such as teach falshoods; and therefore Hearers are not bound to decline Hearing any, but such as they have reason to conceive teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods Word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because Hearers are not all of them at any time, nor any of them at all times enabled or fit to examine the Office, Power, or Gifts, or Brotherhood of those they may hear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is lawful to hear such as are neither in Office, Power, nor Gifted Brethren; as it was lawful for <hi>Apollos</hi> to hear <hi>Priscilla, Acts</hi> 18.26. <hi>Timothy</hi> to hear <hi>Lois</hi> his Grandmother, and <hi>Eunice</hi> his Mother, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. the <hi>Iberian</hi> Prince, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Maid; the <hi>Indians, Frumentius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Beraeans</hi> are commended for their examining St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, without examining his Office, Power, or his Gifts, or Brotherhood, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the Scriptures be the rule of the Doctrine we are to hear, then are we bound to look to no more for the lawfulness of our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than the congruity or agreement of what we hear with it; yea, we sin if we do not hear it, whoever he be that brings it; as on the other side, if any bring it not, though he be a Minister in Office, Power, or a Gifted Brother; yea, or an Apostle, or an Angel from Heaven, he is not to be heard, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To forbid a man to hear him that preacheth, or declares the Truth of God, because he knows him not to be, or conceives him not to be a Minister in Office, Power, or a Gifted Brother, perhaps out of partial prejudice against him, or upon false reports and surmises, or because he is not of his Party, may be a means to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a mans edification, and salvation, and to harden him to his perdition. Which is not unusual, but too too often; many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to hear them that preach sound Doctrine, because they say they rail, when they reprove their errours, or vices; and choosing to hear those that are of their way, and preach according to that which they like, or else turn Seekers, denying any to be Ministers, but such as speak by immediate and unerring motion of the Spirit; or hearing none at all, because of dissenting judgment from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Wherefore, though I grant that Christ hath appointed Ministers, as is said, and that it is wisdom to choose and hearken to such, and most of all to the best, and the most able: and though the reading of Mr. <hi>Matthew Pool</hi>'s <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>? might deterr many, who take upon them to preach constantly and publickly in solemn Assemblies, as Gifted Brethren, from their practice which they use. Nor do I deny there may be liberty, yea, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100176:43"/>
duty occasionally, especially when there is want of Ministers in Office to preach; yet I deny, that <hi>a lawfulness to hear them as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, or as Gifted Brethren, doth necessarily thence arise.</hi> For suppose a Minister, or Gifted Brother, should be Heretical, yet he is not to be heard, but shunned, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. Here by the way I take notice, that if it be lawful to others, then Ministers to preach as their liberty permitted to them. Some practice that is a part of Instituted Worship, is warranted in Scripture, as the persons liberty by permission without command; and therefore hearing of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Ministers may be lawful and warranted in Scripture as mens liberty by permission without command, which was my answer to this Authors first Argument against hearing them, and is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by his Concession concerning the preaching of Gifted-Brethren.</p>

               <p>It is added: <hi>'Tis the</hi> minor <hi>(or second Proposition) that is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, in the thoughts of some, of a denial: which we prove</hi> per par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, <hi>thus.</hi> 1. <hi>'Tis not lawful to hear them as Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: they are not such, therefore may not be heard as such.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I deny this consequence, if a man either ignorantly or fraudulently get into the place of a Minister of the Gospel, or be unduly chosen or ordained; yet if he have the place of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Gospel, and preach it truly he may be heard as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Gospel, though he be not such; that is, rightly called and stated in that Function.</p>
               <p>The reasons whereof are, 1. Because every Hearer is not bound to examine the entrance of the Teacher into his Function; therefore it is enough to hear him as such, that there is nothing appears to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because it is above the ability of Hearers to judge of the Ministers Call in many Cases, the resolution thereof depending upon sundry Controversies about the power of Election and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, which they are not able to discuss; and there are many proceedings in getting Testimonials, using means for obtaining Ordination, Institution, (besides what concerns their Baptism) which either they cannot, or their time and estate will not permit them to enquire into, and sure Christ hath not bound men to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In all Governments and Societies, the peaceable Possessour is presumed to have right till the contrary be evinced, otherwise
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100176:43"/>
there would be perpetual unquietness, and so Societies be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Nor do I think even in the most Reformed, no not in the Congregational Churches, it would be permitted to a Member of the Society to decline the hearing of him, who is taken for their Minister by the most, though he conceive or know him to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duely admitted into the Office. Sure I am St. <hi>Paul</hi> did apply the Precept <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. to <hi>Ananias</hi> as High Priest, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.5. though it was manifest that he was not such, by any legitimate succession, but by unrighteous practices, and favour of the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour in <hi>Judaea.</hi> Yea, the Scripture makes <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to <hi>prophesie as High Priest,</hi> though (contrary to the Law) not High Priest for life, but <hi>that year, Joh.</hi> 11.51. and if relations of the Histories of those Times be right, no legitimate Successour in that Office, but an Usurper, and yet our Lord Christ did not except against him, when he was convented before him, as convented <hi>coram non judice,</hi> or any other way excepted against his Office. And therefore I judge that Christs example and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> are sufficient Warrant to us to submit to, and hear them that are not right Officers, when they peaceably possess the place; and consequently it is lawful to hear them as Ministers of the Gospel, who are not such rightly called. But let us consider this Authors Plea against the present Ministers of <hi>England.</hi>

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100176:44"/>
for the Electing of their own Officers, according to the tenor of the ensuing Scriptures,</hi> Acts 6.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If this could be proved, there need no more to prove, That the present Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> are not to be heard, for if they be <hi>Thieves and Robbers, the sheep will flee from them,</hi> and ought to do so, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.5. But it is an ill sign of an inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and audacious spirit, for so high a charge (which he that fears God, I think, should tremble to bring against so many Preachers of a Reformed Church) to bring so low a proof; which, if it be well considered, may be not only urged against Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Preachers, if he mean by particular instituted Church (as his meaning appears to be by his Preface) a Church gathered in the Congregational way by Church Covenant, as they speak, but also against his gifted Brethren, who have not authority to Preach mediately by election of a particular Church, but onely from their gifts. And if it be said, They are chosen by the Church; yet this will not authorize them, unless the Church have power to choose any besides their own Officers, which this Author doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. Now let it be considered, what a heavy burden is put on the consciences of hearers. They must hear no Thieves and Robbers, no nor any Stangers: if this Author argue rightly from this Text, and all are Thieves, and Robbers, and Strangers, who are not chosen by a particular instituted Church, who have power onely to choose their own Officers, therefore they must hear no meer gifted Brethren, no Itenerant Preachers, though approved by Tryers, none but their own Officers, and those right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chosen; and consequently they must, before they hear them, know their Election to be right, and the particular Church ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them to be rightly instituted, which tends to such dictra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of peoples minds, and alienation of them from hearing, as can end in nothing but meer Irreligion, and make men Seekers or Quakers, the mischiefs of which are too too conspicuous. But I shall more directly answer this Argument, and that so much the rather, because the Text <hi>John</hi> 10. is abused by Papists, to prove, that they are not right Shepherds, who have not authority from the Pope, whom they make the <hi>One Shepherd,</hi> v. 16. (as <hi>Hart</hi> in his <hi>Conference</hi> with Dr. <hi>Rainold,</hi> Chap. 6) from whom all Bishop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And indeed the whole purport of the Parable doth tend to this, that he onely was the <hi>good Shepherd</hi>; that is, the Messiah fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets; and that all other that pretended to be the Messiah, or good Shepherd, such as <hi>Theudas,</hi> and <hi>Judas of Galilee,</hi> mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 5.36, 37. and if there were any other like them, were but <hi>Thieves,</hi> and <hi>Robbers, Strangers, Hirelings,</hi> though they took on them to be Shepherds; they were but <hi>false Christs,</hi> such as Christ foretels <hi>should arise, Mat.</hi> 24.24. But let it be granted, that <hi>the door</hi> is the same Joh. 10.1. and 9. the <hi>entering in,</hi> v. 9. cannot be meant of entring into the Ministery lawful election of a particular Instituted Church. For then it would follow, that every one that enters into the Ministry by by election of a particular Instituted Church <hi>shall be saved, and go in and out and finde pasture,</hi> which is manifestly false. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>entring,</hi> is meant of every True believer, and is by faith in Christ, who is the right door, by whom, that is, by his Doctrin, men come to be his Sheep, and he is their Shepherd. But be it, that the entring be into the Ministery, and that entring be by vertue of Authority derived to them from him, how is it proved they are not authorized by Christ immediately who work not Miracles? Have not many, especially in cases of necessity, been Ministers of Christ by immediate inward call, who have not wrought Miracles? It were hard to conclude of <hi>Petrus Waldo,</hi> and many other Reformers, that had no power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that they were not Ministers of Christ (that I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of gifted Brethren) that they were Thieves and Robbers, because they had no immediate calling by a particular Instituted Church. Sure this would be to <hi>offend against the generation of Gods children,</hi> who in the darkest times of Papal Tyranny, took upon them to Preach the Gospel, without a praevious election of a particular Instituted Church. But how doth he prove, that those that receive authority to Preach the Gospel mediately from Christ, have it from some particular Instituted Church of Christ? He alledgeth no other but this, that <hi>to a particular instituted

Church of Christ, power is solely delegated for the electing of their own Officers.</hi> But what then? may not, for all this, power be given to some others to choose, send and ordain Preachers for the unconverted, who yet may be Ministers of the Gospel, and may be heard as such?

                  </gap> Instituted Churches?

But how proves he <hi>the power for electing their own Officers delegated solely to a particular Instituted Church of Christ?</hi> He saith, <hi>it is according to the tenour of the ensuing Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> whereof one is <hi>Acts</hi> 6.5. and that relates onely one act, of choosing the seven Deacons by the whole multitude of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> who cannot be well counted such a particular Instituted Church, as made up one Congregation to meet every Lords day for all Ordinances: they were too numerous to be such, nor were they organized under fixed Officers with such constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is now made necessary to a particular Instituted Church: Nor did they choose the Deacons upon any conceived power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated from Christ, by vertue of any rule established by Christ or his Apostles, which should be perpetual in all ages to all Churches; but upon advice of the Apostles for their more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to attend on other work of more importance, and their own liking: nor, if it were to be a perpetual rule for all Churches in all ages, can it be any rule for choosing other Officers besides Deacons, there being a peculiar reason, why they should choose Deacons, whose honesty, prudence, and mercifulness was to be discerned, and not other Officers, whose sufficiency to Teach, and Orthodoxie were to be considered; of which the whole multitude of Disciples then, and the <hi>major</hi> part of a particular Instituted Church are rarely now competent Judges. The other text <hi>Act</hi> 14.23. hath no colour to prove such a delegated power, but from one word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which our Translation renders [<hi>when they had ordained.] Beza,</hi> after others, [<hi>Per suffragia creâssent, Had created by suffrages;</hi>] and because the word arose from a custom among the <hi>Greeks</hi> of choosing their Officers by Suffrages or Votes, signified

by the stretching out of the hand, conceives, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,</hi> did not create the Elders in the Churches, without the Churches election, signified by stretching out of their hands, to shew their consent to the elected; and thence is inferred, that so it should be now. But this is but one example, (though it is not to be denied, that in after ages, which were times of Persecution, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were chosen by the Church) and therefore seems not sufficient to inferr a necessary perpetual rule of such election; especially o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther passages shewing the Constituting or Ordaining of Elders without mentioning of any such election, as <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.

                  <hi>Sect. 4.</hi> The present Ministers may be heard as Gifted Brethren.</head>
               <p>There is yet more of the like stuff; 2. Saith he, <hi>'Tis not lawful to hear them as Gifted Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The most of them are not Gifted Brethren; Nor,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Brethren, being Canonical Drunkards, Swearers, Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That any of them are such, it is to be bewailed, and in a Christian way the persons that are guilty, are to be rebuked, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. not to be thus charged in Print, in a Book vented in the dark, tending not to amend them, but to make them odious; even with them that are too much inclined to censuring and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of those that dissent from them, or are of an opposite party. But how it appears that the most of the present Ministers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are such as he stigmatizeth them, I know not; and I hope it is not true. However, if it were so, it proves not that others bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualified might not be heard; nor that these men may not be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren; yea, if he follow St. <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.15. alledged a little after, he is <hi>not to account them as enemies, but to admonish them as Brethren:</hi> and were all this, and more true, yet they might be heard preach the Gospel as Brethren Gifted, as <hi>Judas</hi> was to be heard, though declared by Christ to be a <hi>Devil, Joh.</hi> 6.70. But what saith he of the rest?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The best of them cannot by Saints, in respect of Gospel Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, be so accounted: For,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>There was never any giving up of our selves each to other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God and Primitive example, whence such a Brotherhood doth result.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> By [<hi>Saints</hi>] I doubt not he means such as are members of a particular Instituted Church Congregational, distinct from Parish Churches, either under Episcopal or Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For such only are accounted <hi>Saints</hi> by him, <hi>as give up themselves each to other, according to the Will of God, and Primitive example</hi>: and by [<hi>Gospel Communion</hi>] no doubt he means hearing of them preach, praying with them, receiving the Sacraments from them, or breaking Bread in the Lords Supper with them, or submitting to them, or joyning in Ecclesiastical Discipline with them; which is in effect to make an utter separation from them, as no members of a Christian Church. Now this assertion shews not a dram of Christian Love, but very much antipathy in him, who denies not <hi>p.</hi> 93. <hi>but that there are some amongst the present
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100176:47"/>
Preachers of this day, that are good men:</hi> and methinks he should tremble to exclude such from Gospel Communion here, from whose Company he would be loath to be excluded hereafter. But he doth not <hi>insanire sine ratione.</hi> He implies in his first reason, that <hi>giving up of our selves each to other,</hi> (he means by Church-covenant in the Congregational way) is <hi>according to the Will of God and Primitive example</hi>; which is either explicitely or implicitely to engage themselves one to another, to walk together, and to hold Communion in all Gospel Ordinances. I will not say this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, nor at no time necessary; but that it is according to Gods Will, by way of Institution for Church Communion, or according to any Primitive example, I do not yet find. Gods Command for such a Church Covenant, I remember not to have found alledged, nor Primitive example: besides, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. which is far from the purpose, the <hi>Macedonians giving their own selves to the Lord,</hi> and <hi>then to Paul and Timothy by the Will of God</hi>; being no Covenant between themselves to walk together in Christian Communion, but a free addicting themselves to the Ministry to the poor Saints elsewhere in <hi>Judaea,</hi> by making a Collection very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for them, and urging St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> to prosecute the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection at <hi>Corinth,</hi> with offer of assistance of some of their own to that end. And the assertion [<hi>whence such a Brother-hood doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult</hi>] is groundless. For though some have made the Church Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant the Form of a particular Instituted Church, as Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in his <hi>Answer to Apollonius, Ch.</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thence deduced the right to Communion, and the relation of Brother-hood; yet the Scripture makes all who hold the same Faith and are Baptized into Christ, to be Brethren and Members of all the Churches of the World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27, 28, 29. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12, 13. and 10.16, 17. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. whence it follows, that the assertion of the resul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Brother-hood in respect of Gospel Communion from such giving up of themselves each to other, is opposite to the unity of Christians; and doth rather tend to make particular Churches, particular Parties, than to advance the Communion of Saints in the Catholick Church. Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> is more charitable, <hi>Trip. p.</hi> 523. I doubt not to say (according to my conscience) that among those which live under the tyranny of the Pope, and do not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly separate from him through ignorance, there be many Christians sincere, according to their knowledge, belonging to the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, and so to be accounted our godly Brethren.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saith he, <hi>We cannot (as things stand) perform the duties of Brethren to them, according to</hi> Mat. 18. <hi>nor will they, or can they in the state in which they stand, to us.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:100176:47"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Reason depends upon many uncertainties, if no Errours; of which I have said somewhat before, <hi>in Answer to the Preface, Sect.</hi> 15. in the <hi>Addition to my Apologie, Sect.</hi> 17. and much more is in <hi>Grot. Annot. in Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. <hi>Selden de Syned.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>They are all members of the same Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Profess themselves to be one Brother-hood; so saith their Rime upon the Lords Prayer, Our Father which in Heaven art, And makest us all one Brother-hood, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Gospel Communion is either private or publick: There is private Gospel Communion in private reproof, and I think (as bad as the worst of the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> be) they are to be accounted by real (though perhaps they be not by Pharisaically minded reputed) Saints as <hi>Brethren in respect of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Communion.</hi> Even towards them is to be that exhortation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thy self, lest thou also be tempted,</hi> which sure humble Saints do. There is private Gospel Communion in opening their minds one to another, as it is said, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Then they that feared the Lord, spake often one to another:</hi> and this St. <hi>James</hi> requires, <hi>James</hi> 5.16. <hi>Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another that ye may be healed.</hi> Now concerning this, it follows not, if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100176:48"/>
the best of the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, in respect of Gospel Communion, we must also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the worst of them. Publick Gospel Communion may be in hearing them, praying with him, praising God, receiving the Lords Supper, exercising with them, or submitting to them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Church Discipline. In some of these at least, I know no sufficient reason, why the Saints may not account the worst of the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> as Brethren, in respect of Gospel Communion. <hi>Judas</hi> might be heard as an Apostle, and if he were a Communicant at the Lords Supper (as Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in his first Book Chap. 9. <hi>de Syned. Ebraeorum,</hi> seems to me to evince) there is warrant to receive the Lords Supper with the worst of them. We find that those that made acclamation to Christ when he rode into <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> were a mixt multitude of Disciples, Children, and such as came to the Feast; though it is likely they were not Disciples, <hi>viz.</hi> those <hi>Greeks that desired to see Jesus,</hi> as may be gathered by comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.9, 15. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.37. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12, 20, 21. Yet our Lord Christ himself justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their joyning together in their praying and praising God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.16. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.39, 40. Sure it can be no sin in any person to joyn in the true worship and service of God with any, if he have no command to withdraw himself from that service be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their presence, nor power to exclude them, and yet is bound to the duties then performed. <hi>Believers might prophesie and hear it, though Unbelievers came in,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.24, 25. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are commanded to <hi>separate, and not touch the unclean thing,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. But those they are to separate from, are no other than <hi>Unbelievers,</hi> and <hi>the unclean thing is the Idol, v.</hi> 15, 16. not the true service of God, because of the presence of some scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Brother. <hi>The people of God are to come out of Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18 4. but that is no other than <hi>Rome,</hi> and that because of its Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 18. <hi>We are not to keep company with a man called a Brother, if he be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with such an one, no not to eat,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. But this prohibited keeping Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and eating can be meant of no other than arbitrary, unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary society in civil things, and eating common Bread, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>v.</hi> 10. that keeping Company which is forbidden to such Brethren, is allowed in <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. to the <hi>Fornicators of this world</hi>; which cannot be Gospel Communion, keeping company in eating the Lords Supper, but civil eating. The Doctrine of defiling our selves by the presence of wick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d men at the Lords Supper,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100176:48"/>
hath begotten so much superstition in the minds of many well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted people, that they can scarce ever break Bread with comfort, no not in the best Instituted Churches; there being seldom such an unspotted Congregation but that some or other is known, or reported, or suspected to be guilty of some sin, or errour, which is made sufficient to exclude themselves from the Communion; so that as they use to speak, <hi>they are not free to break Bread,</hi> and that before the fault be examined, or the person judged upon trial to be guilty and impenitent; which makes those very Churches, which by themselves are counted purest and best Disciplined, to be full of Brawls, and rash censures and separations, and without any regular Discipline of any long continuance. These things being considered, I answer, that I know no evil in it, to account the worst of the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> Brethren, in respect of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Communion, (if not under regular censure) in Hearing, Prayer, Praising of God, eating the Lords Supper, nor evil to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them members of the same Church, and of one Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, according to the Rime, which should not be derided by any holy, sober Christians, being only the Lords Prayer in Metre.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Bishops are acknowledged by the present Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as their Reverend Fathers, in respect of their Ordination, but as Brethren only in respect of Gospel Communion. Nor do I think the Bishops affect the title of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Fathers,</hi> as if they were superiours over the Ministers or People, in respect of <hi>the common Faith, had dominion over their Faith,</hi> or <hi>were Lords over Gods heritage,</hi> or would be called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> or <hi>Fathers</hi> in that sense, in which our Lord Christ appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates these Titles to himself and his Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8, 9, 10. in which sense I acknowledge any tender enlightned soul should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor to give it to them. I conceive they are far from usurping that Title, as the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, who now hath ingrossed the Title of <hi>Pope,</hi> that is Father heretofore given to other Ministers, even to Deacons; and doth claim the Prerogative to be the <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Bishop,</hi> and <hi>Universal Monarch,</hi> as Christs Vicar over the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100176:49"/>
whole Church; as having power to make Laws binding the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science out of the Case of Scandal and Contempt, to determine infallibly in point of Faith; with much more, wherein he <hi>sitteth in the Temple of God, showing himself that he is God,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.4. But I conceive the Title of <hi>Reverend Fathers</hi> is given to them, and taken by them in no such sense; but that they account not only the Ministers, but also the meanest Christian, their Brethren in Christ. Yet may they be called <hi>Reverend Fathers,</hi> not only in regard of their Age, and their success <hi>in begetting others through the Gospel in Christ Jesus,</hi> as the Apostle of himself, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. in which respect there have been, and I presume some of them are rightly termed <hi>Fathers in Christ</hi>; but also in respect of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Dignity, according to that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke not an Elder, but intreat him as a Father.</hi> In which respects usual Titles may be given, even to the unworthy, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.1. and 26.25. and such compellations and salutations have been used by holy persons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.10. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.21. as warrantable; which <hi>Quakers,</hi> and tender Consciences not enlightned, but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by prejudice and undue suggestions abhor, as <hi>giving flattering Titles to men,</hi> disclaimed by <hi>Elihu, Job</hi> 32.22. whose example and opinions are not imitable: nor doth this Author any good Office to any in such affrightments, whereby our Breach is widened, and our Wound uncurable.</p>

And so after due admonition (according to the Scripture) and a perseverance in their sin, to be separated from, by vertue of positive and express precepts of Christ,</hi> Mat. 18. 2 Thess. 3.6. <hi>Now we command you, Brethren, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw your selves
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100176:49"/>
from every Brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he received of us: with what vehemency, authority, and holy earnestness doth the Apostle press separation from Brethren that walk disorderly? We command you, and we command you in the Name of the Lord Jesus; and we command you Brethren, by vertue of our relation to each other, and that love and endearment that is betwixt us as Brethren, that you withdraw your selves, &amp;c. I scarce know any one thing pressed by the Apostle with greater vehemency, than what is here instanced in: wherein we have also an undeniable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Argument, that the persons of whom we are treating, walk disorderly: Those that walk not after the tradition received from the Apostles, (we may add, and from the Primitive Church for above three hundred years after Christ, but according to the traditions of the old Bawd and Strumpet of</hi> Rome) <hi>are such as walk disorderly: But the present Ministers of</hi> England <hi>walk not after the tradition received from the Apostles, but after the traditions of the Whorish Church of</hi> Rome: <hi>therefore they are such as walk disorderly. What Apostolical tradition have we for stinted Forms of Prayer, or Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in the Church? did they frame any? (those that are ascribed to some of them, are all spurious, as hath been over and over proved.) For Surplice, Crossing in Baptism, and many other Gewgaws used by them? If they have any Apostolical written Tradition for these things, let them produce it, and we shall lay our mouths in the dust, and for ever be silent, as to a charge of this nature. If they have not (as there, is nothing more certain) they are disorderly walkers, if the Apostles Argument be valid, We command you to withdraw from such as walk disorderly. But who, I pray, are these disorderly walkers? how shall we know them? they are (sayes the Apostle) such as walk not after the tradition received from us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though it belongs to the persons charged here to speak for themselves, and not to me, who am not chargeable with the accusation, as here it stands, yet conceiving they would say the same in effect, which I shall say now, I do, that the invalidity of this Authors arguing may appear, say thus much for them; but chiefly for the truths sake.</p>
               <p>I conceive they will deny, that <hi>they covenant and protest with detestation against a Reformation according to the Scripture, and the best reformed Churches,</hi> and would challenge this Author to prove it, that he may not be found a Calumniator; that they would take on them the justifying of their <hi>submitting to Ordination, or Re-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by a Lord Bishop, their owning (as consonant to Scripture) a Liturgie or stinted Forms of Prayer in the Church, their reading

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether they be faulty or not, this I think I may safely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch, that these practices (except the first, which I assure my self they will deny) whether justifiable, or sinful, are not of so great a degree of pravity, as that barely for them they should be <hi>reputed in the number of disorderly walkers, and so after due admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition (according to the Scripture) and a perseverance in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, to be separated from, by vertue of positive and express pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Christ, Mat.</hi> 18. 2 <hi>Thess</hi> 3.6. either by a separation of Saints from them in Gospel Communion, or private familiar so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.

Which appears both by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant use of the phrase of sinning against another, in the New and Old Testament, as <hi>Acts</hi> 25.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.9. and 42.22. and 43.9. and 44. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. and 19.4, 5. and 24.11. and particularly in the same Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.3, 4. which were occasioned from Christs words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. where Christ commandeth <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of his Disciples, <hi>to forgive their brother that sinneth against them seven times a day, yea, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty times seven times.</hi> Which can be understood of no other sins than personal injuries; for these alone they were to forgive, as trespasses against them, as the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. shews <hi>v.</hi> 32.35. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12, 14, 15. of which sort those practices imputed to the best of the present Ministers are not. Yet, if they were, the separation is not to be made without an admonition, and gradual process, which I think this Author hath not used towards them, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his own words evince a little before: <hi>we cannot (as things stand) perform the duties of Brethren to them according to Mat.</hi> 18.

Which shews, that <hi>the being to him that is injured as a

Heathen and Publican, Mat.</hi> 18.17. is no other than separation from eating and familiar reception; not from Gospel Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as this Author would have it; and therefore the Text <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. is impertinently alledged to prove his separation from the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> in respect of Gospel Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p>Nor is 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.6. alledged more to the purpose. For 1. the <hi>disorderly walking</hi> there must be understood of sins of greater pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity than the rest, besides the first (which they will deny) char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on them (if they be proved sins) as the vehemency, authority, and holy earnestness the Apostle doth press his command with, doth evince. For this vehemency is not <hi>an undeniable convincing argument, that the persons, of whom this Author is treating, walk disorderly,</hi> as he fansies; but that they, that <hi>walk so disorderly,</hi> as the Apostle here means, are so corrupt, and their walking so evil, that their converse with them in a familiar society, as with others, would not be for their safety, or credit, or the repute of Christianity. Which will the more appear by the instance that is given, <hi>v.</hi> 11. where he saith, <hi>For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busie-bodies:</hi> which shews, that <hi>the walking disorderly,</hi> is not being in some disorder about Church Government, and outward Rites, proper to Ministers (which are the instances of disorderly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here brought by this Author) but gross sins of any Brother (not a Minister) who was bound <hi>to work, or else was not to eat, v.</hi> 10. which Ministers were not bound to do, as <hi>v.</hi> 9. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 5.17, 18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14. shews; nor were they for this not working so as not to earn their own Bread, to be <hi>noted</hi> or <hi>signified,</hi> and <hi>declined, that they might be ashamed,</hi> as is required, <hi>v.</hi> 12.14. Gross sins then common to every Brother, such as those 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20, 21. not those practices charged on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Ministers here by this Author, are meant by <hi>disorderly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.6. which is also confirmed by 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.14. where after the Apostle had beseeched them, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>to know them which laboured among them, and were over them in the Lord, and admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and to esteem them very highly for their works sake,</hi> (which shews he expected not of them other works for the earning of their Bread, than their labour in the Word and Doctrine) he adds, <hi>now we exhort you, Brethren, warn them that are unruly</hi>; the same word which is, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3 6. translated <hi>disorderly,</hi> whom he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>feeble minded, and weak</hi>; and therefore is meant of Brethren, who sinned openly and wilfully; and not of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100176:51"/>
Ministers, who do yield to that which is controverted even by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and godly men, whether it be evil at all; and if it be evil, its not of such a kind as the Apostle any where censures, so as he doth this disorderly walking; and its most likely is practised out of ignorance, errour, fear, or other motive, which may befall an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and upright man. Nor is there any force in this Authors rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, that the practice of the Ministers must be disorderly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unless they can shew an Apostolical written Tradition for those things they practise.</p>
               <p>For 1. it doth not appear, that <hi>the Tradition</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3 6. <hi>of the Apostle,</hi> is any other than <hi>the command, v.</hi> 10. <hi>that if any would not work, he should not eat,</hi> which is not improbable from the conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of the following verses with this, which also makes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the <hi>disorderly walking, v.</hi> 6. is no other than being <hi>idle, and busie-bodies</hi>; the Apostle acquitting himself from <hi>behaving himself disorderly,</hi> v. 7. in that <hi>he wrought with his hands that he might not be chargeable to any of them,</hi> v. 8. and then they need to bring no other tradition to acquit themselves from disorderly walking, than their labouring in the Word and Doctrine according to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17, 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Tradition be further extended to those mentioned 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.15. It will not be necessary that they may be acquitted from disorderly walking, that they produce for themselves an Apostolical written Tradition for a Liturgie, Surplice, or Crossing, they think it concerns him that accuseth them as walking disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in doing them, that he produce an Apostolical Tradition against the use of them. For being (as they conceive) in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves things indifferent, they think it enough that there is no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical precept forbidding them, and then they have this Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. <hi>where no Law is, there is no Transgression.</hi> If it be replied in things that pertain to Gods Worship, there must be an express Institution, or else the practice of it is walking disorderly; besides what is said before in <hi>answer to the first Chapter, Sect.</hi> 3. it may be retorted, <hi>where is your Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical written Tradition by Institution for your</hi> Church Covenant, Infant Baptism, Election of Ministers by most voices, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of members in a Congregational Church by the <hi>major</hi> part, with many more? To use your own words, <hi>if you have not (as there is nothing more certain) you are disorderly Walkers, and to be separated from as well as the present Ministers, if the Apostles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be valid, We command you to withdraw from such as walk disord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100176:51"/>
we know them? they are (sayes the Apostle) such as walk not after the tradition received from us. Eadem in te cudatur saba.</hi> As much may be said of the Separatists, if by Apostolical Tradition be meant an Institution for every thing used in Worship and Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Authors Argument, if it proceed thus, Every one that hath not a written Apostolical Tradition for what he doth, or that doth otherwise than the Apostles Tradition requires, walks disorderly, which is the force of his reasoning, then every one that sins in any kind is a disorderly walker, for sure he hath no Apostolical Tradition for any sin; and then this Author, if he be not a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectist, nor thinks himself excluded from the number of those of whom it is said, <hi>James</hi> 3.2. <hi>In many things we offend all</hi>; and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>If we say that we have no sin, we deceive our selves,</hi> must acknowledge himself a disorderly walker, and to be separated from.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The present Ministers, I imagine, will be apt to alledge for themselves, that they have Apostolical written Tradition, even for those practices for which they are accused as disorderly walkers, to wit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. and be ready to recriminate this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and those of his mind, as disorderly walkers, in separating from their Brethren, disobeying their Ministers, and Governours, commanding things lawful, and to be separated from as practising of division.</p>
               <p>To conclude this matter, Were it granted that the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of <hi>England</hi> were disorderly walkers, and that they were to be withdrawn from, yet this doth not prove that they <hi>might not be heard as gifted Brethren, or that the best of them cannot by Saints be accounted as Brethren in respect of Gospel Communion</hi>: Partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>the withdrawing themselves from every Brother that walks disorderly,</hi> cannot be meant of exclusion of himself from hearing, praying, or receiving the Lords Supper, if such a one be present; unless it be determined, that every one must not only <hi>examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before he comes to the Lords Supper,</hi> which the Apostle requires 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. but also every Brother, even his Minister with whom he is to joyn in Gospel Communion; yea, and hath power to excommunicate his Brother, or liberty, notwithstanding the Institution of Christ, to exclude himself, which sure is no Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition, but a far more disorderly walking, than most of those things, the practice whereof is made by this Author the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters disorderly walking. Besides the injunction to every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>to withdraw himself, not to keep Company,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.6, 14. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100176:52"/>
expressions which note not acts imposed by Church Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, but such as they ought of their own accord to practice, are to be understood of such familiar, private, arbitrary Communion in entertainments, and other societies, as they are at liberty to do or not to do, or might do, were it not for this consideration, not such Communion, as if they omit, they omit the Worship of God, which he hath appointed, and so break his Commandment. Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also, because if the withdrawing were upon publick censure of the Community, yet it must not be (according to their own rule) without a gradual proceeding of endeavouring conviction, and precedent admonition, which being not done to the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>England,</hi> to separate from them, even the best in hearing, and other Gospel Communion is irregular, and unjustifiable.

The word [<hi>Antichrist</hi>] I find not in any place in the Bible, but in the Epistles of St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100176:52"/>
                  <hi>As ye have heard that Antichrist should come, even now are there many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the last time,</hi> v. 22. <hi>He is Antichrist that denieth the Father and the Son,</hi> ch. 4.3. <hi>And every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God: and this is that Spirit of Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come, and even now already is it in the World,</hi> 2 <hi>John.</hi> 7. <hi>For many deceivers are entered into the World, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and an Antichrist, or the Deceiver and the Antichrist.</hi> In which passages I observe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Antichrist</hi> is described as a Deceiver, as one that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the grand truth of the Gospel, and therefore the word in the Scripture use is not applied to persecuting Princes and Emperours, as the great <hi>Turk,</hi> but to false Teachers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the opposition is by denying, not by making himself Christ, but by denying Jesus to be the Christ; and therefore the term Antichrist is not one that sets up himself as if he were Christ, they are expressed by another word [<hi>Pseudo-Christs] Mat.</hi> 24.24. but one that is against Christ by teaching contrary to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the term Antichrist is applied to many false Teachers who were in St. <hi>Johns</hi> time.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That yet there was one <hi>Antichrist</hi> more notable than the rest to come into the World. About whom hath been variety of opinions of old, and of late much controversie, whether he should be a single person, or a state or rank of persons succeeding one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another: whether the <hi>Antichrist</hi> be already come, or is yet to come: whether the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> for some generations, have been the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> or they and some other. The opinions of the Fathers were various as conceiving of <hi>Antichrist</hi> by conjectures, after the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> began to be so haughty, as to usurp do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over Emperours and Kings, and to be tyrannous in cruel persecutions of them that opposed the Papal corruptions, many pious and learned men stuck not to stigmatize the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Antichrists</hi>: and since the Reformation begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> it hath been the common tenent of Protestants, that the later Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have been <hi>the man of sin</hi> foretold 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. the City of <hi>Rome, the Whore of Babylon</hi>; and the Papacy, or Popes, <hi>the Beast,</hi> described <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. which is taken for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> And though some have endeavoured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply these Prophesies to <hi>Caligula, Simon Magus, Domitian, Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>Turkish Sultans</hi>; yet generally not only the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

Protestants, but also the <hi>English,</hi> the most esteemed for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even of the Order of Prelates, such as <hi>Downham, Robert Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, Usher, Bedel, Prideaux,</hi> together with King <hi>James,</hi> and his Defendant <hi>Andrews,</hi> and many more have applied the Prophesies in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. to the <hi>Roman</hi> Popes, <hi>as the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> that was to come. Whence every thing that is retained in the Protestant Churches, not taught or exemplified in the Scriptures, according to the use of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is usually termed <hi>Antichristian,</hi> as coming from <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>the mark and image of the Beast,</hi> in which sense I conceive this Author useth the term <hi>Antichristian,</hi> as being against Christ, and by <hi>power Antichristian,</hi> he means Authority, and Rule Prelatical; by <hi>Office-Antichristian,</hi> the Office of Preaching, reading the Common-Prayer, Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Sacraments, and Discipline according to the Church of <hi>England</hi>; by <hi>Calling Antichristian,</hi> he means Ordination by a Bishop. Now out of this may be gathered an answer to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If by <hi>Antichristian Power, Office, and Calling,</hi> be meant the Papal Power, Office, and Calling, and the <hi>acting in Holy things</hi> be by preaching the Doctrine of the <hi>Trent Council,</hi> in the points determined therein against Protestants, by administring Sacraments according to the <hi>Roman Missal</hi>; and Discipline accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canon Law of the Popes, in which Papal power is established, the <hi>major</hi> is granted and the <hi>minor</hi> denied. For though I deny not that a person Ordained by a Popish Bishop, if he forsake Popish Doctrine, and preach the Truth taught by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, may be heard preach the Gospel, though he do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Ordination, yet while he holds that Doctrine, he is not to be heard as being an <hi>Antichristian Deceiver.</hi> But if by an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Power, Office, or Calling,</hi> be meant by vertue of Ministry, according to the Liturgie, Articles of Religion and Homilies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the Ordination and License of the Bishops, (which this Author terms <hi>Antichristian</hi>) the <hi>major</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; and to the Arguments to prove it, I answer, that that which he calls <hi>Antichristian,</hi> is not truly such, but only miscalled such by him; and therefore till he proves that Power-Office and Calling which he calls such, and means in his <hi>major</hi> proposition is such: his <hi>major</hi> is denied, and it is denied, that what he calls <hi>Antichristian,</hi> is <hi>opposite and contrary to the Power, Office, and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Christ</hi>; or <hi>not to separate from such as act by vertue of such an Office power, is to stand by, and plead for Antichrist against Christ,</hi> until he proves such acting to be really so.

for his <hi>major,</hi> they all moving upon this unproved Supposition, That what he calls <hi>Antichristian, and standing by and pleading for Antichrist,</hi> is in truth such. But because there are some things to be examined in the other Arguments also, I shall survey them also.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant it, if the Assertion were, they that act in the holy things, as acknowledging the Power, teaching the Doctrin, owning the Calling of him that is truly Antichrist, are not to be heard, but to be separated from: But being understood of other things, which the Separatists call Antichristian, it is not true, nor proved by the commands in Scripture, which forbid only to reject Antichristian Doctrin and Worship, not every thing said by any without proof to be a thing of Antichrist. The Baptism given in Popery, is not by all Separatists rejected as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; there is less reason to call the Ministry of <hi>England</hi> a thing of Antichrist.</p>

                  <hi>The minor</hi> (saith he) <hi>wants not sufficient demonstration. First, the present Ministers of</hi> England, <hi>are either from Christ, or from Antichrist.

St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.15, 18. <hi>Notwithstanding every way, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in pretence, or truth, Christ is Preached, and I therein do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, yea and will rejoyce.</hi>

               <p>But let us consider his proofs, that the present Ministers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are not from Christ.</p>
               <p>To the first I answer, that the term <hi>Priests as distinguished from all Christians</hi> in the sense used by the <hi>Convocation of the Church of</hi> England, is the same with <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as appears by the <hi>Latin</hi> translation of the 39 <hi>Articles of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>Art.</hi> 32.36. extant by it self, and in the <hi>Corpus &amp; Syntagma confessionum</hi> of the Protestant Churches, and the Letters of Orders under the seals of Bishops in <hi>Latin,</hi> and this is sure found in Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other names note not any Ministry different from the Ministry of Christ, but are used to signifie some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in their maintenance, or places, which may be annexed to them, and yet their Ministry from Christ. If this Authors reason were good, the names are forraign to the Scripture, therefore the things; it would follow, that Congregational Churches are forraign to Scripture, Lecturers, Sacraments, Ruling Elders, Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant Preachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because their names are not there. But this Author adds,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So are</hi> 2. <hi>Their Officers: Deacons attending tables we read of, but Deacons Praying, Preaching, Administring Sacraments (so called) by virtue of an Office-power, an order of the first step to the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, we find not. Priests in the Old Testament (both true and false) we read of: In the New, Saints are so called,</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the present Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> men are to hear, be more than Deacons; yet this may be said, that if it be supposed, that the Office of a Deacon be not now to attend Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as the first seven Deacons were, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2. yet according to the book of <hi>Ordination, it is his Office, where provision is so made, to search for the sick, poor and impotent people of the Parish, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate their Estates, Names, and places where they dwell, unto the Curate, that by his Exhortation, they may be relieved with the almes of the Parishioners or others.</hi> If they be appointment to <hi>Pray, Preach, and Administer the Sacraments,</hi> they have this to plead, that <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon did both Preach and Baptize, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.5, 12, 38. that St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires of the Deacons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. <hi>That they hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>They that have used the Office of a Deacon well, purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus,</hi> and therefore may the Deacons Office be well conceived <hi>the first step to the Priesthood,</hi> that is, the Office of a Presbyter.

               <p>As for that which is added, that <hi>the present Ministry of</hi> England, <hi>is bounded by men in their Office, so as that they must Preach what they would have them, and cease when they would have them</hi>: I think it is not without example in the best ordered Churches. I do conceive that in the Churches of the Separatists, they would tie their Ministers to Preach according to their Confession, and that if any taught otherwise than according to the <hi>declaration of the Faith,</hi> and <hi>Order of the Congregational Churches, in their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the</hi> Savoy, <hi>Octob.</hi> 12. 1658. they would restrain him, or withdraw from him. Sure the Apostle would have <hi>Timothy to abide at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>that he might charge some that they teach no other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.3. and <hi>Titus to reject an Heretick,</hi> Tit. 3.10. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.30. <hi>If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace,</hi> v. 28. <hi>If there be no Interpreter, let him keep silence in the Church.</hi> Which is sufficient proof, that even those that are Gifted extraordinarily, may be bounded by Order; and they that teach otherwise than they should, may be silenced. Which if the Prelates, or others do, when they should not, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to Christ, who will judge them for it: But it is no proof, that their Ministry is not from Christ, who submit to the commands of men, that have power over them, forbidding them to teach some truths, and forbearing to teach, when it cannot be with safety and fruit to the Church of God, themselves, and them which are without. It is added:</p>

                  <hi>So is it</hi> 3. <hi>to their admission into this their office,</hi> viz. <hi>by a Lord-Bishop without the consent of the Congregation, in which they are as Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In <hi>the Answer to the second Chapter</hi> of this writing, <hi>Sest.</hi> 3. hath been shewed, that the praeelection or consent of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation in which a Minister is to act as an Officer, is not so necessary to his Office, or to the communion with him in it, but that he may be owned, and act lawfully as their Minister in some cases without it. The admission of the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> hath not alwayes been by Lord Bishops; some have been made by Suffragan Bishops, not Lords, and instituted, I think, by Dean and Chapter, and if ordained or instituted by a Lord Bishop, yet not as Lord, but as Bishop, which is not alwayes without the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100176:57"/>
election of the Congregation, who are in some Parishes Patrons; and in others there is supposed in Law, an implicit consent in their Ancestors, yielding that power to the Patron to present, and an after consent by receiving him that is instituted as their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. In some Peculiars and Donatives, there's no institution from a Lord Bishop required, nor alwayes any other than a Licence to preach from the Bishop. But whether these usages be right or wrong, notwithstanding them, yet may the Offices of the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> be from Christ, though this Author further argue to the contrary, thus.</p>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100176:58"/>
take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall be no more remembred by their name</hi>; which is a Prediction of what should be, rather than a Prohibition; and the reason of that Prediction seems to be this, God would not be called <hi>Baali,</hi> that is, <hi>my Lord,</hi> because that word noted a Husband as commanding, or dealing hardly or rigorously with his Wife; but <hi>Ishi,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the first notation of <hi>Ishah, Gen.</hi> 2.23. one from whom the Wife comes <hi>as bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is bespoken as a kind and gentle Husband, which the words, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 19, 20. lead to. But if the reason of the not calling God <hi>Baali,</hi> be as <hi>Grotius</hi> in his <hi>Annot: Although Baal in common use signifie an Husband, she shall not dare to use that name, out of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of that name, which hath been imposed on an Idol:</hi> it may seem, that the reason of not using, should be not the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of bespeaking God by that name, according to the proper and original meaning; but lest either she should in thought remember the Idol, or be thought by others to continue that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous name: For the words are not, thou shalt not use the words at all <hi>thy Husband</hi> among men; but, thou shalt not call me <hi>Baali,</hi> that is, in thy Prayers and Confessions of me as thy God. But if it be understood as a Prohibition, according to the Law <hi>Exod</hi> 23.13. which I will not deny the 17. <hi>v. [For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they shall be no more remembred by their name.]</hi> to import, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived, that it forbids any more than the use of those names with honour, or so as to trust in them, as their worshipers did, when they applyed them to their Idols, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.4. is meant, when the Psalmist saith, <hi>He would not take up the names of their gods within his lips</hi>; that is, as <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, ye are our gods.</hi> Which sense the words before lead to, that they should not any more <hi>prepare their silver or gold for Baal,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 8. and, <hi>as in the dayes of Baalim, wherein she burnt Incense to them, and she decked her self with her ear-rings, and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me saith the Lord,</hi> v. 13. By which name of <hi>Baalim,</hi> was meant the Sun and other Planets, as may be proved out of holy Scripture, and is shewed by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Syntagma de Diis Syris.</hi> So that the forbidding the name of <hi>Baal,</hi> or <hi>Baalim,</hi> doth not appear to be any more than the using of these names, as applyed to Idols, with approbation of the Idolatrous Worship done to them, or giving occasion in applying the name to God, to conceive, as if he were like the Idols, or allowed their

Worship, even as the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.3. forbids any <hi>naming of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, uncleanness, or covetousness,</hi> with any shew of liking.

The Popish Priests are tied to a Book of stinted Prayers, and a prescript Order devised by man, for their Worship and Administration: so are the Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> and that to such an one as is taken out of the Popes <hi>Portuis,</hi> as hath been proved by divers. That the Common-prayer Book in <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth his time was so, you have his, with his Councils Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for it: thus they write, As for the Service in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, it hath manifest Reasons for it; and yet perchance it seemeth to you a New Service; and indeed is no other but the Old, the same words in <hi>English</hi> which were in <hi>Latine.</hi> If the Service of the Church were good in <hi>Latine,</hi> it is good in <hi>English.</hi> How little different the Common-prayer Book now in use, is thereunto they that will take pains to compare the one with the other, may be satisfied. To these parallel particulars might be added sundry more, wherein there is an exact symmetrie betwixt the Popish Priests and the present Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>ex ungue Leonem.</hi> The sum of what we have been offering in this matter, is this. First those Ministers that in their Names, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Admission into their Offices, are not to be found in the Scripture, are not Ministers of Christ, act not by vertue of an Authority, Office, Power, Calling, received from him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Those Ministers that in their Names, Office, Admission in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Office, are at a perfect agreement with the Ministers of Antichrist (such are the Popish Priests acknowledged to be by those with whom we have to do) are not the Ministers of Christ, have not received any Power, Office, or Calling, from him to act in the holy things of God: But such (as hath been abundantly demonstrated) are the present Ministers of <hi>England:</hi> therefore these have received no Power, Office, or Calling from Christ, and so are Antichristian. <hi>Quod erat demonstrandum.</hi>

               <p>To the fifth, I return the same answer that Arch-Bishop <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi> gave. <hi>Surely if those things which were good in the Popes Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical, and either contained in the Scripture, or well used before in the ancient Church, or well prescribed by General Councils, be also in our Pontifical, our Pontifical is never the worse for having of them: for if the thing it self be good and profitable, it forceth not from whom it was taken, or of whom it was used, so that now it be rightly used. But it is most false and untrue, that the Book of Ordering Ministers and Deacons, &amp;c now used, is word for word drawn out of the Popes Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100176:60"/>
being almost in no point correspondent to the same, as you might have seen, if you had compared them together. But ignorance and rashness drives you into many errours.</hi>

               <p>To the sixth, though the English Prelates avouch not the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Popish Writers, <hi>of giving grace, ex opere operato, by the Sacrament of Orders,</hi> as they call it, <hi>of the indelible character im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by the laying on of hands of the Prelates,</hi> with such other of their errours, as wherein they over-magnifie the power they have in their imposition of hands, yet they plead that they do use the words <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.22, 23. in the Ordination of Priests, without blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy or absurdity. Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> in his <hi>Answer to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, p.</hi> 49. of the Edition 1572. in 40.
<q>To use these words (Receive the Holy Ghost) in Ordering of Ministers, which Christ himself used in appointing his Apostles, is no more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and blasphemous, than it is to use the words that he used in the Supper: But it is blasphemy thus outragiously to speak of the words of Christ. The Bishop by speaking these words, doth not take upon him to give the Holy Ghost, no more than he doth to remit sins, when he pronounceth the remission of sins: but by speaking these words of Christ, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost, Whose sins soever ye remit, they are remitted, &amp;c.</hi> he doth shew the principal duty of a Minister, and assureth him of the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Gods Holy Spirit, if he labour in the same according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

The Holy Ghost may be used, to signifie not the person alone, but the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and the very power and authority which is given men in the Church, to be Ministers of Holy things, is contained within the number of those gifts whereof the Holy Ghost is Author, and therefore he which giveth this power, may say without absurdity, or folly, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> such power as the Spirit of Christ hath endued his Church withal.</q>

               <p>Besides, I add, sith the laying on of hands is together with the designation of the person, a sign of prayer, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.16. and in Confirmation, and the Apostles use <hi>Acts</hi> 8.15. and

               <p>To the twelfth, The practice of leaving Benefices, is not strange to any Churches: even from <hi>New England</hi> some have come into <hi>Old England,</hi> leaving their places there; nor are there wanting like instances of Congregational men at home, perhaps for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter benefit, without consent of the people. The practices are not on any side justifiable in all: yet we read in Scripture of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movals of Ministers from one place to another upon urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
               <p>To the thirteenth, The person Ordained hath <hi>authority commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by the Bishop to preach the Word of God in the Congregation where he should be lawfully appointed</hi>; that is, by License, which is thought needful to be added besides Ordination, because all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are not alike fitted for all Congregations; the Voice, and other abilities not serving for one Congregation, which will for another.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:100176:62"/>To the seventeenth, Even the late <hi>Assembly of Westminster</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed a <hi>Directory for Worship and Ministration.</hi> The Common-prayer Book, that now is urged, should not be judged the worse in those prayers or portions of Scripture, which are holy and good, because they were in the <hi>Popes Porluis</hi>; no more than the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of <hi>Jesus to be the Son of the most High God,</hi> is the worse because the Devil used it, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.7. And therefore King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. his plea for it was good; and the thing not to be misliked, because used in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; who though they have many great corruptions in their Doctrine and Worship, yet have they retained the Bible, Apostles Creed, many prayers from ancient Fathers, and some Popes who were holy men and Martyrs in the first Ages, which are not to be rejected, because continued by later vicious and Antichristian Popes. That which is insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as if the Common-prayer Book now in use, were little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the <hi>Popes Portuis</hi> or <hi>Missal,</hi> is very untruly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly suggested. He that shall impartially, and without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice compare the one with the other, shall find a vast difference in the things liable to exception. I have made some view of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Missal</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> the 5. and <hi>Clement</hi> the 8. and <hi>Breviary</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> the 5. and <hi>Urban</hi> the 8. and though I deny not sundry Collects Prayers, Hymns, Lessons, Psalms, Epistles and Gospels are the same in the Common-prayer Book in <hi>English,</hi> with those in <hi>Latine,</hi> as being either parts of Holy Scripture, or agreeable to it; yet there are so many differences in fundamentals of Doctrine, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials of Worship; and in Rituals, as the invocation of Saints, and the opinions of Merit, sacrifice for Quick and Dead, adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Host, vertue of the Cross, half Communion, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more things material, that I cannot but judge that either much ignorance, or much malice it is that makes any traduce the <hi>English Common-Prayer Book,</hi> as if it were the <hi>Popish Mass Book,</hi> or as bad as it; and to deterr men from joyning with those Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Services therein, which are good; as if it were joyning with <hi>Antichrist the Pope,</hi> or <hi>receiving the mark of the Beast,</hi> when they can hardly be ignorant that the Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes were burnt for it, is impudent falshood. By <hi>the parallel par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</hi> and such other as might be alledged, cannot be inferred <hi>an exact symmetrie betwixt the Popish Priests and the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of England.</hi> In many particulars might there be shewn a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelism between Ministers of the Congregational Churches, and Presbyterial, and the Popish; yet an exact symmetrie would not thence be demonstrated. Few of these particulars alledged, are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100176:62"/>
unjustifiable, those that are, if not excusable, yet are far from that which is the main thing charged on the Papists, and disputed against learnedly, by Mr. <hi>Francis Mason</hi> against <hi>Champney,</hi> that <hi>they Ordain Priests to offer the unbloody sacrifice of the Mass for Quick and Dead</hi>; which is abhorred by the English Prelates and Ministers, and they are not to be charged to symbolize in Office with the Popish Order of Priests, for which this Author hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced nothing, though it were the chief thing to be proved: and therefore the <hi>minor</hi> of his Syllogism is denied, and it is manifestly false which he saith, <hi>he hath abundantly demonstrated it,</hi> he having said nothing to prove it in the main.</p>

The consequence of the</hi> major <hi>(or first proposition) is manifest, the Office of a Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop is Antichristian, therefore those that act by virtue of a Power, Office, or Calling received from them, act by virtue of an Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Power, Office, or Calling. That the Office of Lord Bishops is Antichristian, one would wonder should be denied in such a day as this, after so full a demonstration thereof by many witnesses of Christ, who have wrote so clearly in this matter, as if they carried the Sun-beams in their right hand, especially that it should be denied by persons of Presbyterian and Congregational principles (if indeed any of them do deny it.) To prosecute this matter to the uttermost, is not our present intendment, the intelligent Reader knows where to find it done already to our hand: and if after all that hath been said, any through self love, or fear of persecution, will herein be ignorant, we might say, Let them be ignorant.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Office, Power, and Calling received from a Lord Bishop, is all one with the Office, Power, and Calling received from a Bishop Suffragan, who is not a Lord; and therefore the adding of the title <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Bishop,</hi> being only a civil title, they being made Barons of the Land by the King, and nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to their Ordination, but only giving them power to vote

in Parliament or Convocation with other dignities, is only brought in here <hi>ad faciendum populum,</hi> to create envy or hatred against them in the Common people or others, who are prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with prejudice against them. What their Office is, as Bishops, may be best discerned by the <hi>Book of Consecration,</hi> which I gather from their promises and the prayers then used, to be <hi>the instruction of the people committed to their charge out of the Holy Scripture, and to teach or maintain nothing as required of necessity to eternal salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that which they shall be perswaded may be concluded and proved by the same faithfully to exercise themselves in the same Holy Scriptures, and call upon God by prayer, for the true understanding of the same; so as they may be able by them to teach and exhort with wholesome Doctrine, and to withstand and convince the Gainsayers, to be ready with all faithful diligence to banish and drive away all erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and strange Doctrine, contrary to Gods Word, and both private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and openly to call upon, and encourage others to the same, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and set forward as much as shall lie in them, quietness, love, and peace among men; and such as be unquiet, disobedient, and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous within their Diocess, correct and punish according to such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as they have by Gods Word, and as to them shall be committed by the Ordinance of the Realm, to be faithful in Ordaining, Sending, or Laying hands upon others, to shew themselves gentle and merciful for Christs sake to poor and needy People, and to all Strangers desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of help.</hi> These are their Offices which they are required to perform at their Consecration, whatever their practise be, it pertains not to the present point; this is the Office they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and it is as much wonder to me that any sober man should assert this to be Antichristian, as it is to him that some should deny it. I deny not but there are many that have termed Bishops Antichristian, nor have there been wanting who have said as much of persons of Presbyterian and Congregational principles, but such use of this term I have alwayes condemned, even when Bishops were lowest, as tending to nothing but to inflame the minds of Dissenters in opinion with hatred one against another: but I have not met with any sober Writer, or considerate man, who in conference hath judged their Office as it is undertaken by them to be Antichristian. I deny not that many learned men at home and abroad have disputed, whether Bishops are by Divine Right an Order above Presbyters, nor have there been wanting even of the Bishops themselves who have denied it: Somewhat I have read on both sides, but shall leave that controversie now, and only examine what this Author saith to prove, the Office of Lord Bishops to be Antichristian.</p>

                  <hi>We shall,</hi> saith he, <hi>propose briefly a word or two in this matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Office that is not to be found in the Scriptures of the institution of Christ, but is contrary to express precepts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his, is Antichristian: But the Office of Lord-Bishops is not to be found in the Scriptures, is contrary to express precepts. Therefore.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I think the <hi>Major</hi> is not true, if universal. The Office of some Religious Votaries is not to be found in the Scriptures of the institution of Christ, but is contrary to express Precepts and Commands of his, and yet may not be Antichristian, in that special sense in which the Scripture useth the word <hi>Antichrist,</hi> nor as I suppose this Author useth it, unless he make every sin to be Antichristian. But because the <hi>Minor</hi> is that which he insists on, I pass to his proof of it.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The minor Proposition consists of two parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Office of Lord-Bishops is not to be found in Scripture of the institution of Christ: He gave indeed Apostles, Prophets, Pastors, and Teachers, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11. of Pastors and Teachers we read <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, 8. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.8. Bishops also, and Deacons without the interposition of any other Order, we find 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. Deacons we have appointed, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.

(Gr. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Bishops,</hi>) but where the Office of Lord-Bishops was instituted by Christ, we are yet to seek: indeed some appearances of a spirit striving to ascend into this chair of wickedness, was seen in <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> and others, in the Apostles time, but these were the Antichrists that were then gone abroad into the world. The Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11. speaks as fully to the Officers and Offices instituted by Christ, as any we meet with: Fail they in their deduction of their Office from hence, and they will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly prove successless in their attempts. Let us then fix here a little; mention we find here of Apostles, Prophets, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Teachers, none at all either here, or elsewhere of Lord-Bishops. But perhaps their Office, though they are called by another name, is comprehended in some one or other of these, let that then be considered. Are they Prophets? that (in the sense of the Spirit in this place) they will not pretend to. Are they Pastors or Teachers? This is too great a debasement of their Lordships, their Parochial Priests over whom they preside, are supposed to be Offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers in that degree. What then are they? Apostles! Their successors, they do indeed boast themselves to be,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100176:64"/>
and are so accounted by their abettors (and so doth the Pope himself) but how prove they their Succession from them? if they derive it through the Papacy, who sees not the invalidity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? How lubricous and uncertain is that their Succession? How do they therein proclaim their shame, and yield the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Controversie? What clearer argument that they are Antichristian, if the Pope be the Antichristian Head over many Countries, as is by the generality of Protestants believed, and will not by themselves be gainsayed? But in what sense do they pretend to be the Apostles Successors? Do they succeed them as Christians? that is not the thing in question, they stand or fall, in respect thereof to their own Master; herein we have no controversie with them, as not willing to judge any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time. Do they succeed them in respect to their Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ice? let them prove that, and take the cause. The Apostles were first immediately sent by Christ; secondly, extraordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Commissionated to the Preaching of the Gospel through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Nations of the World: Are their Lordships such? what can be imagined more frivolous or false? Where find we any Apostles after the departure of those that were immediately by Christ called to that Office? Did the Apostles ordain any as their Successors therein in any of the Churches of Christ? Where read we of their so doing? yea, are any qualified with Gifts as they, for the discharge of such an Office? or doth Christ indeed send forth servants in any imployment, and not furnish them with Gifts sutable thereunto? <hi>Credat Apelles?</hi> Apella <hi>would have been printed.</hi> What more dishonorable to the Lord Jesus can be asserted? It remains then, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither Prophets, nor Apostles, nor Pastors, nor Teachers, that they are not to be found in the Scripture of the institution of Christ. Nor are they dreamed of in the world of several hundreds of years after Christ. <hi>Clemens</hi> in his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> takes notice of no other besides <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>th, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the Church.</hi> But this was not the usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Superiority of Order of a Bishop above a Presbyter, but a proud pragmatique, arrogant practice over the Church, Brethren, Strangers, even St. <hi>John</hi> himself, together with very injurious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent proceedings in words and deeds, which are nothing to the bare challenge by dispute, or assuming by collation either of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100176:65"/>
Civil or Ecclesiastical Power, a Superiority of Order above Presbyters; nor is <hi>Diotrephes</hi> mentioned as one of <hi>those Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs that were then gone abroad into the world,</hi> or any mention of <hi>Antichrist</hi> in that Epistle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I know not the reason, but I take notice that in this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage reciting <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11. twice, he leaves out <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and concludes thus, <hi>It remains then, that the Bishops being neither Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, nor Apostles, nor Pastors, nor Teachers, that they are not to be found in the Scripture of the Institution of Christ.</hi> Which conclusion might be overthrown, if it were pleaded, that they were Evangelists, and so successors to <hi>Timothy,</hi> termed an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. and to <hi>Titus,</hi> whose work is alledged for a pattern of Bishops, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. &amp; 5.19, 22. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5. But sith that title is declined by pleaders for Episcopal Superiority, I let it pass.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the term of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> is challenged by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: and what saith he against it? <hi>This is too great a debasement of their Lordships:</hi> which is a Satyrical Sarcasm, no proof. Did any of them say so, or count it to be so? If any did so, he shewed himself unworthy of the name, yea forgetful both of what he promised and prayed for, alluding to this very Text, as his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, and which was expresly charged on him by the Arch-Bishop when he delivered him the Bible. Nor doth it any whit derogate from the congruity of the titles of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> as it is given to Bishops, that <hi>their Parochial Priests over whom they reside, are supposed to be Officers in that degree,</hi> than it doth from the giving of the Title of <hi>Teacher</hi> to a Presbyter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Assistents or Coadjutors are given them in case age or infirmity hinder them from the frequent doing of that office.

If any, to stop the mouths of the clamourous Papists, have derived their Succession from the Bishops under the Papacy, by proving (as Mr. <hi>Francis Mason</hi> did) <hi>the Consecration of the Bishops after the Reformation by three Bishops allowed by the Romanists themselves after the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Canon,</hi> though perhaps more than needs; yea, though they were Consecrated and Ordained by the Pope himself and some Cardinal Bishops; yet, if they were Consecrated, or Ordained to no other work, nor in any other manner than Priests and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships are Ordained and Consecrated, according to the order of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they would not be <hi>Antichristian.</hi> For though it be not gainsayed, but <hi>that the Pope is the Antichristian head over many Countries</hi>; yet it is gainsayed, that all that is derived from him, or done by him, is <hi>Antichristian.</hi> I do not think it is Antichristian to confess the Apostles Creed, though a person say he believes it, because it is received from the Pope and <hi>Trent Council.</hi>

               <p n="5">5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That <hi>Bishops as a Superiour Order or Degree above Presbyters were not dream'd of in the World, for several hundreds of years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ</hi>; I think can hardly be made good: though I will not meddle with that point, which hath been debated so much by men of greatest and most exact skill in Antiquity, with whom I conceive my self no way fit to be compared: yet this I say, that the <hi>not taking notice of Bishops distinct from Presbyters by</hi> Clement <hi>in his Epistle to the</hi> Corinthians, published not long since by <hi>Patrick Yong,</hi> is ballanced by the passages in <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Epistles, if they be genuine, concerning which, the Reader may judge by what Arch-bishop <hi>Usher</hi> hath written in his Edition of those Epistles of <hi>Ignatius.</hi> As for <hi>Lombard</hi>

But granting it to be a Precept, is it a Precept to the Apostles only, or to others? The former hath countenance from the Text:</p>

               <p>But if it be to others, it is doubtful, whether to all Christians, or only to Ministers of the Gospel; and, whether it forbid simply Dominion at all, or such Dominion as the Rulers of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> exercised; to wit, Tyrannical; or the affectation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate seeking of it, not the having or the exercise of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In my <hi>Romanism discussed, Article</hi> 7. <hi>sect.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 172, 173. I have set down ten Reasons to prove, that <hi>the Rule</hi> meant in those Texts, is not only Tyrannical Dominion, but also the Dominion of one Apostle over another, and the affectation and inordinate seeking of that rule, which a person may have, and lawfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise; and this is forbidden not only to Ministers, but also to all Christians: but not a Christians having or exercising the Office of a King or Civil Magistrate; nor the Apostles Rule over the Church of God, or Ministers of a lower Order: For then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should be forbidden to exercise that Office which is Gods Ordinance; and the Apostles did ill in practising and appointing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100176:67"/>
Rule over Christians, yea of some Ministers over others in some cases. But the Rule which is forbidden, is, <hi>Rule over the Faith</hi> of the Saints, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> disclaims 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. and the Popes usurp (whose decrees in points of Faith, and determinations of doubts of Conscience, and impositions of Laws binding the conscience are made unerring) such Rule over Princes in secular Affairs with pomp &amp; outward grandure, like Gentile Princes, as the same Popes usurp, rule for themselves, not for Christ, rule by force, not by authority of Gods Word. If any Lord-Bishop affect, seek, take upon him, or exercise such Lordship or Dominion, it may be censured for Antichristian, yet not his Office, but his practice is to be thus censured; and this not to be imputed to his Order, but his Person. But to judge so of a person barely, because of the Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> which was given by <hi>Sarah</hi> to her Husband, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as meet, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. or to deny any liberty to manage any civil business to an Ecclesiastical person, because of those words of Christ is more than I conceive they have sufficient ground to do. Sure such Congregational men as have been Heads of Colledges in the Universities, or Vicechancellors, or Leaders of Forces, have given occasion to be termed Antichristian, as well as Lord-Bishops, if Lordly Dignity, and Secular Rule merit that appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>As for 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. the Annotation in the Book of the <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> termed <hi>the Assemblies,</hi> is thus, <hi>Lords] that is, not imperiously commanding your own inventions, instead of the Doctrine of the Gospel; nor carrying themselves insolently and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisterially towards Gods people,</hi> 3 <hi>John ver.</hi> 9. which imports not an Office forbidden, but the evil practice of them whose Office is allowed; For this very Exhortation is given to those who were Elders among the Christians, even St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who entitles himself <hi>a fellow Elder to them,</hi> and therefore contains not a Precept forbidding the Office of a Lord Bishop, any more than of an Elder, such as St. <hi>Peter</hi> was, but the abuse of the Office; nor doth it forbid Lordly Dignity, but Lordly Rule; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Bishops Rule should be <hi>Pedo non Sceptro,</hi> not as Princes, but as Shepherds.

               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> That Office that is derived from, and is only to be found in the Papacy, is surely Antichristian (if the Pope be the head of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, this must not be denied.) But the Office of Lord-Bishops is derived from, is only to be found in the Papacy. Which of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches that have separated from the Papacy have retained it? Did the woman in her flight into the Wilderness carry it along with her? What more absurd, then to run to the persecuting Whore and Beast for an Office of Ministry? and what more evident demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its being an Antichristian Office, than its entertainment only by that false Antichristian Church, and its utter rejection and detestation by the true Spouse and witnesses of Christ in all ages? What is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over to us in this matter by some of them; we shall briefly affix hereunto. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> and in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary on the Epistle of <hi>Titus,</hi> professes, That it is more by custom than by any institution of the Lord, that Bishops are become greater than the Elders or Ministers. <hi>Harm. of Conf. Sect. 2. Tit. 11.</hi> So from him do the Churches of <hi>Helvetia</hi> proclaim; whence they infer (and that truly according to <hi>Act. 4.9.</hi>) That no man by any right can forbid, but that we should return to the old appointment of God, and rather receive that, than the custom devised by men. <hi>Wickliff</hi> in his Answer to King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, citing <hi>Mat. 20.25. 1 Pet. 5.3.</hi> sayes, Lordship and Dominion is plainly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to the Apostles, and darest thou then usurp the same? If thou wilt be a Lord, thou shalt lose thy Apostleship, &amp;c. The University of <hi>Geneva</hi> say, (<hi>Theses Genev. 71.</hi>) These functions following, we hold to be altogether false, and destitute of all true foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Primacy of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> over all Churches; the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalship, Patriarchship, Archiepiscopalship, and briefly the whole degree of Lord Bishops over their fellow Elders. <hi>Marlorat</hi> in his Exposition on the <hi>Revel. chap. 17.3.</hi> sayes, That Archbishops, Deans, &amp;c. are in Office under Antichrist; yea upon <hi>Chap. 9.</hi> that they are the tails of Antichrist. <hi>Beza</hi> saith, They could not be brought into the Church, until they had driven him out, who is the only Master, Christ: and, there is neither holy Scripture, nor Council, nor antient Doctors, which ever did know such Monsters, <hi>Beza's Confess. Art. 7.14.</hi> The noble antient <hi>Oldcastle,</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> saith, That the whole Episcopal degree of Lord Bishops over their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100176:68"/>
fellow Elders is altogether false and destitute of all true foundation— yea, that all other Functions and Offices besides Priests and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons are unlawful, as being Sects devised by men destitute of all true foundation. To these we might add honest <hi>Bale</hi> upon the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, viz. chap. 17.</hi> where he saith, <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> are the Beastly Antichrist's Metropolitans, and Primates; and upon <hi>Chap. 13.</hi> that Archbishop, Diocesan, Archdeacon, Dean, Prebend, Doctors, Parson, Vicar, &amp;c. are very names of blasphemy: For Offices they are not appointed by the holy Ghost, nor yet mentioned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. <hi>Cartwright</hi> sayes of them, that their Functions are not in the Word of God, but of the Earth, new devised Ministries, and such as can do no good: that their Office is the neck of the Popish Hierarchy, come out of the bottomless pit of Hell. <hi>Fenner</hi> proclaims them to be no natural members of the body of Christs Church, as being of humane addition, not born with her, nor grown up with her from the Cradle. The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> Confession sayes, That they pass not a rush for them. The Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> That the Hierarchie is Devilish confusion, stablished (as it were) in despight of God, and to the mocking and reproach of all Christian Religion. The <hi>Seekers</hi> of Reformation in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time spake fully hereunto, <hi>[2 Adm. to Parl.]</hi> we have an Antichristian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Popish ordering of Priests, strange from Gods Word, never heard of in the Primitive Church, taken out of the Popes Shop, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Gods Kingdom — The Names and Offices of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, Archdeacons, Lord Bishops, &amp;c. are, together with their Government, drawn out of the Popes Shop, Antichristian, Devilish, and contrary to the Scriptures: Parsons, Vicars, Parish-Priests, are birds of the same feather: to whom might be added many others.</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>1. Though the Pope in these later ages, especially since</hi> Boniface the third, <hi>obtained of</hi> Phocas <hi>the Emperor, more than 600 years after Christ, that</hi> Rome, the seat of blessed <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, which is the head of all Churches, should be both so called and accounted of all, <hi>as</hi> Platina <hi>speaks, and as</hi> Onuphrius <hi>addes,</hi> Had the title of Universal Bishop conferred on him; and it was added, that the name of Pope, which was determined to be the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of all Episcopal terms, the Roman Bishops should alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, whereas before it was common to all Bishops, <hi>hath been judged deservedly</hi> the head of Antichrist, <hi>which</hi> Gregory the Great <hi>Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>had not long before,</hi> lib. <hi>7.</hi> indict. <hi>2.</hi> Epist. <hi>96. made</hi> Antichristian, <hi>and the Usurper</hi> a forerunner of Antichrist: <hi>yet the Bishops of</hi> Rome, <hi>in the first ages, were not so accounted,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100176:68"/>
and therefore, it follows not, though the later</hi> Popes be the head of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichrist, that the Office that is derived from, and is only to be found in the Papacy, is surely Antichristian; <hi>there having been Offices per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps derived from good Popes, and continued only in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>which deserve not that censure, but approbation rather. Nor is it necessary that every thing derived from Popes, since they have been the head of Antichrist, and continued only in the Papacy, should be Antichristian: the head of Antichrist may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute something that is not Antichristian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. It is not true,</hi> that the Office of Lord Bishops is derived from, and is only to be found in the Papacy. <hi>It is manifest in the first</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene Council, Canon <hi>6. that then and before were Patriarchs, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Bishops, and Lord Bishops with their Office; and that Council was in the fourth Century, about the year 326. And that in the</hi> Greek, Eastern, Russian <hi>Churches, the same Office is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued. And therefore though no other of the Reformed Churches had retained that Office, besides the</hi> English, <hi>yet there would be no need for the Bishops of</hi> England to run to the persecuting Whore and Beast, for an Office of Ministery. <hi>But it is also pleaded, that the</hi> Lutheran Churches reformed, that have separated from the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in Germany, Denmark, Swethland, <hi>have retained the same Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice under the name of</hi> Superintendents, <hi>which is the same in</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, <hi>with Bishops in</hi> Greek; <hi>and that it is false, that</hi> the true Spouse and witnesses of Christ have in all ages utterly rejected the Office of Lord Bishops, and that it hath its entertainment only by that false Antichristian Church. <hi>Yea, it is manifest by the many Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles written to the</hi> English <hi>Prelates, by the reception at the</hi> Synod of Dort, <hi>and innumerable other wayes, that there hath been no such rejection or detestation either by any Church reformed, or Eminent Writers of them, except those of the Separation, who have been also averse from the Discipline of the Protestant Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches beyond Sea, and have given opprobrious Language to, and of them, as well as the</hi> English. <hi>As for the testimonies here cited, some of them, as the Speeches of</hi> Hierome, <hi>the</hi> Helvetian Confession <hi>of the Lord</hi> Cobham, <hi>are only about the superiority of Bishops above Presbyters, not of their Office; most of them, as that of</hi> Wickliffe <hi>used before by</hi> Bernard <hi>in his Tract to Pope</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius, <hi>those of the</hi> University <hi>and</hi> Church of Geneva; Beza's, <hi>the</hi> Belgick, French Confessions, Marlorat, Bale, <hi>are against the Popish Hierarchy; those of</hi> Cartwright, Fenner, <hi>and</hi> Authors of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, <hi>were Speeches of Adversaries, which in no Court pass for testimonies; to which Arch-Bishop</hi> Whitgift <hi>and others have given answers long since.

               <p>Object. <hi>One stone of Offence must be removed out of our way ere we pass on further; it is this: Though Lord Bishops are Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, yet it doth not follow, that the Office and Ministry derived from them is so: For they are also Presbyters, and Ordain as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That they act in the capacity of Presbyters in the matter of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, is false.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Contrary to their own avowed Principles; their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships think it too great a debasement, to be degraded from their Lordly dignity to so mean an Office.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Contrary to their late practice, whereby they have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared the nullity of a Ministerial Office, received from the hands of a Presbytery, in thrusting out of doors several hundreds of Ministers so Ordained.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What if this should be granted? it would avail nothing, except it can be proved, that they are, and act as Presbyters of the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, which (these being only in a particular instituted Church of Christ) will never be to the worlds end. Thus far of the third argument.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, to some that have either renounced Episcopal Ordination as Antichristian, or refused to hear Ministers Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Bishops, as acting by virtue of Antichristian Calling, it hath been told, that the Bishops were first Presbyters, and Ordained Presbyters together with Presbyters; and some of them that held that a Bishop and a Presbyter were not superiour in Order, but in Degree, did Ordain as Presbyters; and that therefore, if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Presbyters be not Antichristian, the Ministers should retain their Ordination by Bishops, and the people hear them, though that were yielded, that Lord Bishops Office were Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian. Now nothing is here replied to the allegation, that Bishops Ordain with Presbyters; <hi>the Bishop with the Priests pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100176:69"/>
are to lay their hands on the Ordained,</hi> according to <hi>the Book of Ordination</hi>: Nor to this, that some of the Bishops have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Episcopacy not to be an Order above Presbytery; Nor to this, that though the Bishop imposing hands, do act as of superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Order, yet being a Presbyter, his act is valid, as he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs a thing as conceiving himself as Heir, and Executor, if he be not Heir; yet if he be only Executor, and by that hath power to conveigh it, the grant is good.

It is not true, <hi>that the Bishops do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive power by the Law to act in Ordination, in it are known, and owned only in the capacity of Lord Bishops:</hi> for the Ordination of Suffragan Bishops, who are not Lords, is valid by Law. 2.

Answ.</hi> They do not nullifie Ordination by a Presbyterie in foreign Churches; but in <hi>England</hi> perhaps, because the Laws require Episcopal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and it is conceived necessary to avoid Schism, or some confusion. 2. <hi>However those Presbyters are not of the institution of Christ, these being only in a particular instituted Church of Christ.

               <p>THus it is argued:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Those that oppugn or deny any of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Jesus Christ, are not to be heard, but separated from: But the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> oppugn and deny some of the Offices of Jesus Christ: Therefore. Before we come to clear the several parts of this Argument, we shall crave liberty briefly to premise. 1. That there is a two-fold denying or oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Offices of Christ, Verbal and Professional. Such was and is that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Papists are not guilty hereof; in words they own, preach up, plead for all the Offices of Christ as much as any: so do all the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi>: This is not then the denial of the Offices of Christ we implead them as guilty of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.
Real and actual, when persons do that which enwraps in the Bowels of it, an impugning and denial of the Offices of Christ. This the Romish Synagogue are eminently guilty of: so are the present Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> as shall (we doubt not) be clearly demonstrated in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That a verbal professional acknowledgment of the Offices of Christ is nothing, when contradicted in practice: This the Apostle avowedly asserts, in respect of the knowledge of God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. They profess they know God, but in works they deny him; and may congruously enough be applyed to the matter in hand. This, as applied to the Combination and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> some of themselves have long since ackow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, whilest they profess Christ to be King, and submit not to the Laws he hath prescribed in his Word, they make him an Idol and put a Scepter of Reed in his hand: so some of their own. But I interrogate, What if a man should with the greatest earnestness profess, and in the height of a confident spirit averr, that he were born again of God, washed, sanctified in the blood of Christ, and by the spirit of the Lord, that he did receive and own Christ as his King and Law-giver, when I see this man at the same time walking in a way of Rebellion against Christ, in open contempt and defiance of his Laws and Government

                     </gap> Plea be admitted? Surely no, <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam.</hi> 'Tis long since decided by Christ, that false Prophets are to be descried, not by their words (they may speak like, Angels; cry, Hail Master, kiss him, yet be false Prophets, yea, <hi>Judasses</hi> to him) but by their fruits: Let them profess a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times over, that they own all the Offices of Christ, if they are the mean while found in the practice of those things that are inconsistent with the truth of such a profession, they are real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deniers and opposers of the Offices of Christ. This is that then we affirm in this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.
That those that do really oppose any of the Offices of Christ, are not to be heard, but separated from: This carrying a brightness along with it, that is sufficient to convince all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such, whose eyes the God of this World hath blinded: that its original is from God, we shall take for granted will not be denied by a professing enlightned people, though otherwise it were easie to multiply arguments for its demonstration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.
To oppose Christ in any of his Offices, bespeaks such as are guilty thereof to be Antichrists, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22. and 4.2, 3. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. (of the same mind with us herein, is learned <hi>Beza</hi> upon the forecited Scriptures) and none will surely be so inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate (not to say worse) as to assert, It is lawful to attend upon the Ministry of Antichrist.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To hear such, is to strengthen and encourage them in that their denial of, and opposition unto the Offices of Christ; and thereby become partakers with them in their sin:</p>
                  <p n="2">The thought of which, cannot but be grievous to the poor Lambs of Christ. But this will not be denied.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1 I allow the distinction of verbal and real oppugning the Offices of Christ: But it is false, <hi>that the Papists are not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a verbal denying of the Offices of Christ,</hi> and <hi>that in words they own, preach up, and plead for all the Offices of Christ as much as any.</hi> For though they do acknowledge Christ to be King, Priest, and Prophet, yet their Doctrine, and not their practice only, doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all the Offices of Christ. As he that ascribes Kingly power to a subject, doth make another King than the right King, and so doth u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of piety and reverence as the written Gospel, when the Pope ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them that he is infallible, that he is judge of Controversies, can determine what is to be held as an Article of Faith unerringly, can make Laws to bind the Conscience by vertue of his Authority, without the case of Scandal and Contempt; can dispense with Gods Laws, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful oaths, incestuous marriages prohibited by God; by his indulgences can forgive sins authoritatively and absolutely, that ascribe to every Priest a power to offer in the Mass a propitiatory unbloody sacrifice for the quick and dead, to forgive sins in the Sacrament of Penance, to enjoyn laborious works of penance, which shall be satisfactious to God for sins, while they make Saints deceased, and Angels Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours between God and Man by their merits and agency with God for us</hi>; they ascribe to Creatures the power proper to Christs Offices, and so do make other Prophets and Priests to officiate as Christ; they do <hi>verbally deny the Offices of Christ, and not in words own, preach up, and plead for all the Offices of Christ as much as any,</hi> as this Author most untruly suggests; but do doctrinally eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate them all, of which no such thing can be charged on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> nor is at all demonstrated by this Author.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I grant, that a <hi>verbal professional acknowledgment of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Christ, when contradicted by practice is nothing</hi> to the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the person so professing, in the sense in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 2. <hi>Though I have the gift of Prophecie, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have no charity, I am nothing,</hi> that is, as v. 3. <hi>it profiteth me nothing</hi>; and no further are to be drawn the words of the Apostle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. than that which is expressed in the Text, that to such persons <hi>nothing is pure but their minds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences are defiled</hi>; and so to the Interrogation I answer, such a ones plea shall not be admitted before God, or in an Ecclesiastical censure, or a private judgment, so as that he shall have the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or benefit of a real subject to Christ; yet all this doth not prove that his doctrine impugnes the Offices of Christ, or that his doctrine may not be heard to the profit of the Hearers. <hi>J.

life, not by their doctrine:</hi> He saith indeed, <hi>they are known by their fruits,</hi> but that these fruits are only their evil life, he saith not. No where is any one said to be a false Prophet, that doth not take upon him to prophesie; he may be a bad man, that teacheth no false Doctrine, but not a false Prophet. <hi>Judas</hi> was a wicked man, <hi>a Devil,</hi> but no where termed a false Prophet; yea he was one of those that Christ sent to preach, and one of those of whom he saith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.40. <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me.</hi> In the Old Testament, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.16, 17, 25, 26. <hi>Micah</hi> 3.5. false Prophets are said to be such as <hi>prophesied Lyes in Gods name and he sent them not; that they taught lying divinations, the Visions of their own heart, they cried peace when there was no peace,</hi> they attempted <hi>to draw them after other gods,</hi> Deut. 13.2. In the New Testament, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1 <hi>There were false Prophets among the people, even as there shall be false Teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Lord that bought them,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.1. <hi>Many false Prophets are gone out into the World, and they are said to be such as confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, that they speak of the World,</hi> v. 3, 5. That is true which Mr. <hi>John Ball</hi> in his <hi>Trial of the grounds of Separation,</hi> ch. 13. pag. 312. hath, <hi>If we look into the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, we shall never find the Prophets called true or false in respect of their outward calling,</hi> (I add, or only their vitious lives) <hi>but in respect of their doctrine.</hi> Yea, though a man should by his doctrine deny the Offices of Christ only by remote consequence; as, by teaching something as appointed by Christ, which was not; or denying something to be instituted by Christ, which was so appointed; yet should he not be accounted a false Prophet, but an erring man, who while he layes the foundation rightly, yet through ignorance, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie <hi>builds Hay and Stubble thereon,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.12. And therefore that which this Author doth so confidently pronounce, as if it were as clear as the Sun, and denied by none, but those whose eyes the God of this World hath blinded, [<hi>That those that do really</hi> (that is in their practice, though not in their preaching) <hi>oppose any of the Offices of Christ, are not to be heard</hi> (no not when they preach saving Truths of the Gospel) <hi>but separated from,</hi> (not only in respect of private or Church Communion in the Lords Supper or Prayers, but in attending on the Ministry of the Word delivered by them) which is his <hi>major</hi> proposition] is so far from being light, that it seems rather to me, some of that smoak of the bottomless pit, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

many poor souls from hearing that Word, wherein the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ the image of God doth shine unto men. Nor were not <hi>professing enlightned people,</hi> as he calls them, held by prejudice, or guided by affection more than by judgment, could they grant this proposition. For if according to this Authors di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates, he that really, that is, in heart or practice opposeth any of the Offices of Christ, is to be separated from: then every one who disobeys his Commands, believes not his Words, that is an hypocrite; yea, that sins or errs in any thing Christ hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed or commanded, is to be separated from, and not to be heard; and so all must turn Seekers or Quakers, if they do not meet with a Teacher who is perfect without sin or errour. As for what this Author saith for demonstration of it, that <hi>such are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22. and 4.2, 3. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. and <hi>that</hi> Beza <hi>is of the same mind, and that they that hear them strengthen their opposition unto the Offices of Christ, and partake with them in their sin,</hi> is false. For neither doth St. <hi>John,</hi> nor <hi>Beza</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> count any for <hi>Antichrists</hi> there meant, but such as <hi>by their doctrine oppugne Christs Nature or Office,</hi> which he terms <hi>the false Doctrine of the Antichrists</hi>; nor is he at all guilty of the sins of the Minister who is evil in his life, by hearing him preach truth; yea, though he preach some errours, and it be probable, that when he hears him, he shall hear some errour preached by him, unless some other way he abet his sin or errour, or omit his duty in seeking to amend him.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though I doubt not but I could retort this Argument upon this Authour, whom by sundry passages in this Book I judge to be one that <hi>hearkens not to the Revelation Christ hath made, and as supreme Lord and Law-giver hath enjoyned to be observed touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Order and Ordinance of his house,</hi> even that most express, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. one <hi>of the principles of the Doctrine of Christ, and part of the foundation,</hi> Heb. 6.1, 2. Yet I shall wave that, and answer directly by denying the <hi>major</hi>; of which I give these reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because denial, is more than not hearkning to; the one is by positive contradiction, the other may be only by Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The not hearkning may be out of ignorance, incapacity to understand, dulness, slothfulness, fearfulness, mistakes, prevalency of temptation without any enmity of heart, habitual stubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or willful gainsaying, which are requisite to a plain denial of the Kingly and Prophetical Office of Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There may be sundry Orders of his House revealed by Christ, which are controverted, whether they be such or no; there may be some acknowledged to be Orders of his House, yet thought not of such moment as that the peace of the Church should be broken by contending for them; or judged not perpetual, but temporary; or not binding the Ministers to observe, till the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate reform; as in the case of putting down Images, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in cases of necessity, or for avoiding of Scandal, they may not hearken to them; as in <hi>Davids</hi> eating the Shew-bread, the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> not hearkning to the Order of discontinuing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, and a <hi>Jewish</hi> Vow and Offering; in these, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more cases a person may not <hi>hearken to the Revelation Christ hath made, and as supreme Lord and Law-giver hath enjoyned to be observed touching the Orders and Ordinances of his House,</hi> and yet be so far from denying the Prophetical and Kingly Office of Christ, that he may be sound in the Faith, and a zealous and faithful maintainer of them, by holding forth the truth of the Gospel unto the death. And therefore I take the <hi>major</hi> proposition of this Argument to be manifestly false, which he seems by not proving to take for manifest truth.</p>

               <p>But he goes on thus: <hi>'Tis the</hi> minor <hi>(or second Proposition) that

in the thoughts of some is capable of a denial, but the verity thereof shines forth as the Sun in its brightness, in the review of the Orders and Ordinances of the House of Christ appointed by himself; and the present frame and deportment of the present Ministers of</hi> England <hi>with respect thereunto: which of them have they not made void by their Traditions? This is that which Christ hath said,</hi> 1. <hi>That all power for the Calling, Institution, Order, and Government of his Church, is invested solely in him, as the alone Lord, Soveraign Ruler, and Head thereof,</hi> Mat. 28.19. 1 Tim. 6.14, 15. Joh. 3.35. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. and 5.31. <hi>'Tis upon this foot of account that Christ chargeth his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples not to be called of men Rabbi, nor to call any Father,</hi> (viz. <hi>not to impose their authority upon any, or suffer themselves to be imposed upon by any in the matters of their God</hi>) Mat. 23.8, 9, 10. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one is their Master and Lord</hi> (viz. <hi>Christ.) Hence also the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles lay the weight of their exhortations upon the Commandment of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23. and 14.37. <hi>Proclaim all to be accursed that preach any other Gospel,</hi> Gal. 1.8. <hi>(yea though Angels from Heaven, should they live and speak as such) charge those to whom they write not to receive any into their houses that bring any other doctrine, (much more not to receive them as their Teachers)</hi> 2 Joh. 10. <hi>Yea, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord in the close of the last Revelation of his Will, it pleased this great King and Law-giver in such a way to give forth, testifies that if any man shall add unto these things, the Lord shall add unto him the Plagues that are written in his Book,</hi> Rev. 22.18. <hi>Do the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Ministers of</hi> England <hi>conform unto this great Institution? in words indeed they do so. But what meaneth the bleating of the Sheep, and lowing of the Oxen in our ears? Do they not own other Lords, Heads, and Governours, that have a Law-making power, and would enforce the Consciences of the free-born Subjects of Christ over his Churches besides him? what doth this less than evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim their disobedience and rebellion (which is as the sin of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft) against the King of Kings, and the rejection of his Scepter and Soveraign Authority over them! But of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is no strange thing to find in this Author high Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges backed only with confident assertions, and no proofs; so that men, comparing the one with the other, may think he wrote his Dreams, rather than Meditations. For what are we to think o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise when we read such passages as these: <hi>the verity of his</hi> minor <hi>proposition shines forth as the Sun in his brightness?</hi> Which is no more than is to be said of the first universal indubitable principles of the light of Nature or Reason, which are indisputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100176:73"/>
and yet he saith, <hi>in the thoughts of some it is capable of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial:</hi> and when he should prove it so clear, in stead of an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proves all with Interrogations, which if the Reader deny, he is put to a stand. But to shew the vanity of his arguings to his Question, <hi>which of the Orders and Ordinances of the house of Christ appointed by himself, have not the present Ministers of</hi> England (he means all, even the best of them, as his words, <hi>ch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 2. and arguings against them <hi>indiscriminatim</hi> do evince,) <hi>have they not made void by their Traditions</hi>? I answer by another Question, Which of them have they so made void? Sure the Ordinances of <hi>searching the Scriptures, hearing the Word, praying to the Father in the name of Christ, believing on the Son,</hi> with many more (which are the chief Orders and Ordinances of the house of Christ, appointed by himself) have not been made void by the Traditions of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>England</hi> that now are, at least not by all or the best of them, that I know or hear of. But he imagines he can prove it by an induction of particulars, of which he names only seven; though to make his induction full (without which it is no good Argument) he should have reckoned seven times seven. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he thinks if he can make good the charge in these seven, it will be without question his charge is true of the rest. Let us then view each of these in order, and see how well he hath acquitted himself therein.</p>
               <p>The first of these Orders or Ordinances of Christ is, that all <hi>power for the Calling, Institution, Order and Government of his Church, is invested solely in him as the alone Lord, Soveraign Ruler, and Head thereof.</hi> Which I grant as a truth, though I assent not to his Paraphrase on <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.8, 9, 10. as if Christ did forbid the Apostles <hi>to impose their Authority upon any in the matters of their God</hi>; which they did, <hi>Act</hi> 15.25, 28. But how comes this to be an <hi>Order, Ordinance, Institution of the house of Christ appointed by himself?</hi> Such Orders I took to be Precepts of Christ to us, but this seems to be Gods gift to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.35. and 5.22, 26, 27. and 17.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. and 5.31. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no Precept to us. But let it imply a Precept to us; Do not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Ministers of <hi>England</hi> conform to it? He grants, <hi>they do so in words,</hi> but not in deeds. Why so? <hi>They own other Lords that have a Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and if true would unchristen them, but I see no proof of it, so that I take this to be only a piece of Oratory, such as <hi>Tertullus</hi> used against St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 24. which is so much the more veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in that it is <hi>in generalibus</hi> without instancing in particulars, which is the sign of a Diabolical Calumniatour. Yet I shall not let it pass. The Lords he means are either the King or the Bishops. The King is owned by the Ministers in the Oath of Supremacie, the Bishops in the promise at their Ordination, wherein they <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise the Lord being their helper, to obey reverently their Ordinary, and other Ministers, unto whom is committed the charge and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over them; following with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions, and submitting themselves to their godly judgements.</hi> The Law-making power of the King is with the Parliament, of the Bishops in the Convocation, the enforcing of the Conscience (though it be an uncouth phrase<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as supposing the Conscience can be enforced by man, which is impossible) is meant of Causative Compulsion, by enjoyning men to act or speak according to such Statutes or Canons as are imposed on them under certain penalties. How many, and which of these Acts or Speeches are rebellion and rejection of Christs Authority, is to be demonstrated; and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of place and Authority to be thus criminated after the manner of Railers and Scolds.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Crimination proceeds on these suppositions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Christians should separate from the Parish Assemblies, and joyn together in the Congregational way by Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which they call <hi>separating from the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That Ministers are bound to reject, and not to admit to the Communion those that are profane, and to admit only real Saints in the judgment of Charity, and that by opposing the way of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and promiscuous admission to the Communion, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the solemn appointment of the Lord. For my part having read somewhat in Mr. <hi>Ainsworths</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> Writings, both concerning the way of the Separatists in the Low-Countries, and the Independents in <hi>New-England,</hi> I do not either in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures here alledged find such a solemn appointment of Christ, either that private persons, or Ministers are to make such a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as these Authors do press upon the Consciences of others: nor hath experience either in the Low-Countries, or <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New-England</hi> given such encouragement to sober minded Christians, as to engage them in that way, but rather many divisions, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings into errour, and other evils, have given too much cause for men to doubt, whether it were ever a Plant of Gods planting. It is granted that <hi>it is the will of Christ, that those whom he hath called by his Word should separate from the World</hi>; And this they are to do in respect of their Worship, so as not to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them therein: and this I doubt not may be proved from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. and some other of the Texts alledged. But then by <hi>the World,</hi> are meant professed Infidels, such as denied the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> and worshipped Idols; or at least such as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Unbelievers, as <hi>John</hi> 15.19. and 17.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100176:75"/>
19.9. the Jews were, and yet the Apostles did not refuse to go to the Temple to pray, nor to go into their Synagogues, or to take a Vow and purifie themselves at the Temple, notwithstanding the corruptions of their Priests, Service, and People, and their open opposition to the Christian Faith. But that ever it was the Will of Christ that Christians should separate from the true Worship of God, and the Professors of true Faith in Christ, because of either known evil in the Coversation of those present, or only suspected, or reported, is without all colour of Precept or Example in the Holy Scripture. It is true, <hi>the people of God</hi> are invited, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. <hi>to go out of Babylon:</hi> But that <hi>their going out</hi> is by separation from the Service of God not Idolatrous, or from a Church not Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, by reason of some supposed or real corruption, or disorder, or defect in Government, Service, Members, or Ministry, is so far from the meaning of the Text, that it needs no other refutation, but the looking into the Text and comparing it with the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter. Of <hi>withdrawing from such as walk disorderly,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.6. enough hath been said before, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>sect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 6. Nor is it made any where the Ministers Office to make such separation as the Separatists require. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. is not spoken of Ministers as belonging to their Office <hi>to judge them that are within</hi>; or if it be, yet <hi>the putting away, v.</hi> 13. is not made his act; and how it is to be done, is best discerned by <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Christians are to walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Societies or Churches, for their mutual edification and comfort in the Lord:</hi> and this they are no doubt bound to do, as occasion is, towards all Christians. And so much <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. and 17.4. may prove: but that they are to conjoyn in separated Churches by the so termed <hi>Church Covenant,</hi> as if they were not Members of other Churches, nor to joyn in Prayer, Praise of God, hearing, breaking Bread, but with either that one Church or Company, to which they have associated themselves, or those that are of the same way of Church-order, is neither proved from those Texts, or 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. (which mentions no such Church-Covenant, as it is alledged for) nor any other. And therefore the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here used to the Ministers and Churches without distinction, are so unsavoury, and from such an intemperate Spirit, that I had rather cover them, than rake in such a dunghil. And I think re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the fraternity this Author seems to be of, should have made him wary in charging the Ministers with these things, lest some of his adversaries should throw as much dirt on the face of the separated Churches out of <hi>Bayly's Disswasive, Edwards Gangraena, Welds History of Antimonianism,</hi> yea, the <hi>Preface to their

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, that those whom he calls Officers, are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in some or other of those Texts he cites, and are some of them termed <hi>gifts</hi> given by God or Christ, in, or to, or for his Church or Body: But there are also other, as <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> mentioned in some of the Texts as given also by God; and therefore those whom he reckons are not the <hi>only Officers of his appointment,</hi> nor all of them to <hi>be in one Congregation.</hi> Apostles were certainly to go up and down, and though they had not <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or Lordly Authority over others,</hi> yet had they authority, preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and some kind of superiority over others, and if not in the same measure, yet some superiority is still allotted to Pastors over Deacons, which are acknowledged to be Officers to be still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Church: nor is it unlikely, that <hi>those Elders who were worthy of double honour,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. had some preeminence above the rest; nor doth the relation of Brotherhood hinder, but that though in respect of the common Faith all of them are equal, yet some may have some Power or Office committed to them, which others have not, and so may have authority over them. That some
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100176:76"/>
Offices or Services may be added to those mentioned, may be gathered from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.19. whether all the Officers or Offices be rightly ordered in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is not our present enquiry. Much hath been said before in answer to the second and third Chapters of this writing, which need not be here repeated. That the present Ministers of <hi>England, have neither name nor thing required by Christ in this law,</hi> is notoriously false; the names of Pastors, Teachers, or Doctors, Deacons, or Ministers, and the Office of Preaching the Gospel, continues therein, both in the name and thing. That they have <hi>set up other Officers and Offices, as if in open contempt and defiance of Christs authority,</hi> cannot be said but very unrighteously; nor do the alterations or additions, any more prove it, then the setting up Catechists, or Expositors, or Lecturers in the primitive or later times, proves open defiance and contempt of Christs authority. He goes on in the same vein of crimination thus:</p>

               <p n="5">5.
<q>That these Officers be chosen by the common Suffrage of the Church of Christ, and solemnly set apart by Fasting and Prayer, this is evidently comprised in the ensuing Scriptures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15. and 6, 1, 2, 3, 5. and 14.23. and 1.23, 26. and 9.26, 27. In conformity whereunto, we find the Saints for many centuries of years after Christ, in the peaceable possession of this their priviledge and right. <hi>Clemens</hi> in his Epistle to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> p, 57. saith, Our Apostles also knew by our Lord Jesus Christ, that Contention will be about the name of Episcopal charge: Therefore for this reason, having received a full predetermination, they constituted such as were forenominated; and in their instructive distribution delivered, that if they were negligent, other approved men should receive their Ministration, being ordained by them, or in the mean time by other choice men, all the Church consenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Yea afterwards, let some one among you, Ingenious, Merciful, filled with Love speak; if through me Faction, and Contention, Schisms, I will depart: Of which if you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I return, and will do the things appointed by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Wherein he fully asserts the priviledge of the Church or People of Christ, we are pleading for: And afterwards du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the raign of Antichrist, Christ hath not left himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100176:77"/>
a witness, nor his people without Champions to plead their right in this matter. To instance but in a few: That lively witness of Christ <hi>Martin Luther</hi> loudly proclaims, That the voice of the People ought not to be severed from the chusing of Ecclesiastical persons. And long before him, <hi>Cyprian</hi> (who lived about 260 years after Christ) sayes, <hi>Plebs obsequens,</hi> &amp;c. The people that obey the commands of God, and fear him, ought to separate themselves from a wicked Pastor, seeing the people themselves chiefly, have either power to chuse Pastors that are worthy, or to refuse those that be unworthy, <hi>Cypr. Epist.</hi> 68. and tells us plainly, That this is bottomed upon the authority of God: That that is a just and lawful Ordination which is tryed by the judgment and voice of all, <hi>viz.</hi> that fear and obey God. Of the same mind, long after, was <hi>Francis Lambard,</hi> the Companion of <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in the Preface of his Book, intituled, <hi>The sum of Christianity</hi>; who sayes, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily every Parish ought to have his proper Bishop, the which should be chosen by the People, and confirmed by the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of every Parish, who if they swerve one jot or tittle from the Doctrine of the Gospel of the Kingdom, ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the people, and others more fit, to be elected by them. And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. of the said Book, he professes, That 'tis the most gievous crime, and by no means to be suffered, that many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Perdition do deprive the people of God of their just right and title, <hi>viz.</hi> to chuse them a Pastor. <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in his common places, refers the chusing and election of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to the People as their undoubted right: To whom we may joyn Mr. <hi>Bullinger,</hi> who sayes, That the Apostles exercised not tyranny in the Church, in Ordaining Ministers without the consent of the People; <hi>Bullin. Decad.</hi> 5. <hi>Serm.</hi> 4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>Gualter</hi> also upon <hi>Act.</hi> 1.25. saith, That those that profess the Gospel, handle the matter as evil as the Monks and Popish Bishops, in that they restore not again to the Church, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of chusing Ministers, which by tyranny they took from them. Of the same mind is <hi>Zanchie, Calvin, Beza, Danaeus, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus. Tyndal</hi> (the Martyr) with many others, as Mr. <hi>Fox, Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. We cannot omit the famous case of the united Brethren of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who concluding the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy to be purely Antichristian, could not allow of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of their Ministers by any in communion with it; and yet being perswaded of a necessity of continuing that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in a way of succession, send some of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>

Churches, who returning with dissatisfaction, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon commit themselves and their cause to God, and chuse Elders from among themselves, and by Fasting and Prayer, solemnly set them apart to the work of the Preaching of the Gospel. To these many more might be added. The practice pleaded for (as is evident) is as antient as the dayes of the Apostles, and the first election of ordinary New-Testament Officers, continued in the Church till after the dayes of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> when Pride and Tyranny soon brought all things into horrible Confusion, upon the pretext of Decency and Order; yet in the worst of times have the witnesses of Christ born their testimony hereunto. What say our Reverend Fathers and Ministers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to these things? Have they not an equal respect to this appointment of Christ, as to those before instanced in? Is there any thing like it almost practised by them, in this great concern of separating persons for the Preaching of the Gospel of Christ? Is not the liberty of the Brethren and Churches of Christ, as much as lies in them, wholly disanulled and broken by them? Have they any such Call to the Ministry? Do they at all value or esteem of it? Are they in the practice of the Primitive Church, or of the Reformed Churches of this day in this matter? Is not the print of the feet of the old Strumpet of <hi>Rome,</hi> the bloody persecutor of the Saints, the cunning Deviser of a new self-invented and whorish Worship, to be solely found in the paths, they are in this matter traversing? and can such be accounted as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Kingdom of Christ, and the real owners of his Authority and Power?</q>

Christ had converted him.</hi> Which are altogether impertinent to prove election of Ministers by the common Suffrage of the Church, and Ordination thereupon to be the appointment of Christ. It is granted before in the <hi>answer to the Preface, Sect.</hi> 22. that there are relations in antiquity of the election of Bishops by the people, which could be no other way then in times of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Emperors were Infidels; yet withal, that even then things grew into such heats, that sometimes the Emperor was fain to interpose for quietness; and after, when Wealth and Power by favour of Christian Emperours were added to Bishops, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bloody frayes, and other evils made that Election so tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, that it was found necessary to put it into the hands of fewer, until the investiture of Bishops being wrested from the Emperours, the Popes seized on it, leaving the election of the inferior Clergy unto the Bishops or Patrons, that had endowed the Ministers with Estates, except in cases reserved to his <hi>Romans.</hi> But, where the Reformation is with the consent of Princes, much of the power usurped by Popes is recovered by them, in other places the people either chuse or consent to the election; which being made <hi>the whole essence of the Ministerial Call</hi> by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational men, and <hi>by Divine Right,</hi> their opinion is opposed by the <hi>London Ministers</hi> in their <hi>Jus Divinum Ministerii Evangelici, Printed</hi> 1654. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8, 9. Nevertheless, the Testimonies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by this Author, are not fully to his purpose; those out of <hi>Clements</hi> his <hi>Epistle</hi> are not home; the former speaks of <hi>constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and appointing Ministers after the Apostles by other famous and discreet men</hi> (as it is in <hi>Burtons</hi> English translation of that Epistle) <hi>with the good liking and consent of all the Church,</hi> which is less then Election constituting their Call. The other contains only a voluntary offer to prevent breaches, which is nothing to the asserting of a power in them rightly seated; if it were such, it would be more then this Author, I think, would yield, that upon <hi>the command of the multitude,</hi> a Minister is to relinquish his place. The words of <hi>Luther, Bullinger,</hi> and perhaps the rest of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants (whose words are not set down) meant no more than the not obtruding Ministers on the Churches of Christ, as the Monks and Popish Bishops did, who put on the People Priests unable to Preach the Gospel, such as fed themselves and not the flock, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out choice or consent of the people. Which, if it be any where practised, is unjustifiable; as on the other side, where people are corrupted with Error, or Factiousness, or Carnal Relations, and S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of a Minister, it is unsafe, or rather more dangerous to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust the Church of Christ, though a gathered Congregation, with the election of their Minister by Common Suffrage without intervention of some discreet and able Ministers to ratifie or disanul it. What <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, upon the occasion of the lapse of <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis</hi> Bishops in <hi>Spain,</hi> of their rejection and the election of <hi>Sabinus,</hi> and <hi>Felix,</hi> was agreeable to the Canons then in use, and to the state of those times: what he saith of <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> is not rightly proved. The Scriptures of the New Testament and Old, prove no Divine Institution of a certain way of electing or rejecting Ministers, so as that there may not be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation from what he saith was in his time: yet it is meet, that according to the sayings of <hi>Cyprian, Lambard, Gualter,</hi> or others, respect be had to people, that they be heard what they can say for, or against their Minister; and that he, who is criminous or insufficient, be not imposed on them to their souls hurt. What <hi>our Reverend Fathers and Ministers of the Church of</hi> England <hi>say to these things,</hi> may be seen in <hi>Whitgift</hi>'s <hi>Answer to the first Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Defence of the Answer,</hi> Tr. 3. p. 170. <hi>Bilson of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Government of Christs Church,</hi> Chap. 15. <hi>Andrews respons. ad Bellarm.

If the Prelates do any thing unjustly therein, they must give an account to God; the Ministers, who consent not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, are not chargeable; both may be accounted as <hi>Subjects of the Kingdom of Christ, and the real owners of his Authority and Power,</hi> notwithstanding what is objected against them; especially if the evil be either from the defect or iniquity of Laws, Canons, and Customs, whereby that redress of Grievances in this kind, which even the Prelates have complained of, is stopped. I confess, that the continuance in force of so much of the Popes Canon Law, or our Common Law, as hinders a godly and able Ministry in every Parish, hath been deplored, and much endeavour hath been to amend things: But the experience that hath been of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty therein, even when Congregational men have been most industrious to rectifie things, should methinks abate the censures of this Author, and rather cause men quietly to wait for a remedy, using the benefit of the Ministry we have, than by separation, and popular election in gathered Congregations make things worse than they are.</p>

                  <hi>Yea,</hi> 7. <hi>What should I mention that grand Institution of this Soveraign Lord and Lawgiver, that nothing be offered up to the Father, but what is of his own prescription (Divine and Spiritual, without affectation of Legal shadows (John</hi> 4.24.) <hi>of worldly pomp or carnal excellency,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>and</hi> 2.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>and</hi> 6.13.) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Isa.</hi> 33.22. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.6, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.33. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31. <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.39. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.1, 4, 31. <hi>It's evident, the present Ministers of</hi> England <hi>conform not to the Orders and Ordinances, Christ as the great Prophet and Lawgiver to his people, hath appointed them to walk by; and therefore really disown the Kingly and Prophetical Office of Christ.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, no Prayers, or Praises, or other Religious exercises should be offered to the Father; but, what is of his own prescription in respect of the service it self, matter, or manner, which he hath prescribed: But when he hath left it free to use a prescript Form of words, or to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such a stinted Form, where he forbids not the use of Musick in praysing of God, and no Idolatry or Superstition is used or furthered by Ordinances and Utensils for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Ordinances; notwithstanding these, the service of God may be <hi>Divine and Spiritual without affectation of Legal shadows of worldly pomp, or carnal excellency, contrary to the texts

alledged.</hi> If any be faulty in that way, it is to be imputed to the persons, not either to others not guilty, nor to the Liturgy prescribed; much less such Ministers as offer up Prayers and Prayses to the Father in the name of Christ for things agreeable to the Will of God, and use the Lords Supper without Idolatry, are to be charged to disown really the Kingly and Prophetical Office of Christ.</p>

               <p>This Author addes.
<q>But perhaps to these things, some may say, These are but small matters, good men differ among themselves herein.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To which we answer,</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="1">1.
That they are part of the Instituted Worship of God; the Orders he hath left his children to conform to, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been proved: to say, That any part of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worship of Christ, is a small matter; is no small derogation to the wisdom of the Lawgiver, that gave it forth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.
What if it should appear, that as small as these things seem to be, they are the grounds of the late Controversies of God, pleaded with fire and sword in most of the <hi>Europaean</hi> Kingdoms? This may perhaps a little stay sober persons from so rash a conclusion, that these are small matters: A serious review of the late Contests of God in the Nations, with the consideration of the grounds and rise of them; will, to persons of sobriety, sufficiently evince the truth of the suggestion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.
As small matters as these, have been severely punished by the Lord: He is a jealous God, and stands upon puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's (if I may so call them) in his Worship: hence is that expression, <hi>Ye cannot serve the Lord, for he is a jealous God,</hi> Josh. 24.19. What should I mention the case of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> 2 Chron 26.16. of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> Numb. 16. of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> whose sin lay meerly in, whose judgment was singly upon this foot of account; his not seeking the Lord after the due order, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. God commands that when the Ark was removed, it should be covered by the Priests, that no hand touch it, that it be carryed on
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100176:80"/>
mens shoulders, <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.11, 15. which Order was violated, when they brought it from the house of <hi>Abinadab,</hi> 'twas unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and upon a Cart, after the manner of the Egyptians, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7. for which breach of Order <hi>Uzzah</hi> is struck dead.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.
As small matters as these, when once commanded by the Lord, are of that force, as not only to deface the well-being, but to overturn the true being of the Worship of God. Take one pregnant instance herein. The Lord commanded the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites by Moses, to bring their Sacrifices to the place that he should chuse, and offer them there; which in it self was but a circumstance of place; yet all the Sacrifices offered elsewhere, were a stink in the nostrills of God, and not accounted by him as any Worship performed unto him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.
But the Objection is altogether impertinent: we are not debating the greatness of the sin, but the truth of what is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi>: what we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are either the appointments of Christ, or they are not; if they are (as hath been proved) the present Ministers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to them, or they do not; if they do not (as nothing more sure) they conform not to the Orders and Ordinances Christ hath left his people to walk by (which is the thing in debate) and therefore really deny his Kingly and Prophetical Office.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> By whom this Objection is made I know not, I think it of use to abate the rigour of the separation, and the sharpness of the Censure that this Author passeth on the present Ministers of <hi>England.</hi> For sure if these matters excepted against, be <hi>small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and good men differ therein,</hi> they are not fundamentals of Faith or Practice; but that notwithstanding defects, errours, or differences about them, Churches, their Members, and Ministers, may be true Churches, Christians, and Ministers; nor should there be separation for these things, but mutual toleration of one another, according to the doctrine of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14.1, 3, 10. and 15.1, 2. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.15, 16. nor Ministers disclaimed, while they hold the foundation, much less so heavily judged, as this Author doth, contrary to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. nor should there be such rents and breaches in the Church of God for them as there are. Though <hi>nothing commanded by God is small,</hi> yet some are comparatively small, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23. that <hi>they are part of Gods Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worship, appointments of Christ,</hi> which he chargeth the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>England</hi> to oppose, needs better proof than is yet made; that <hi>they overturn the true worship of God,</hi> is not demonstrated; nor that they are the <hi>grounds of the late controversies of God,</hi> or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100176:81"/>
that <hi>therein the Ministers sin, as Uzziah, Corah, Dathan, Abiram, Uzzah</hi>; and therefore the judgments of God which fell on them, may be rashly threatened to the Ministers, especially considering that many of them if they sin, may be charitably deemed to sin out of ignorance, not affected, or such weakness as is incident to one truly godly; which how far he grants, may be perceived by that which follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for what is added, that good men differ among themselves in this matter, it's of no more weight than what went before.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For,</hi> 1. <hi>'Tis not at all to the business in hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis possible good men may for a while, do that which really enwraps in the bowels of it a denial of the Offices of Christ. We shall not deny but some of the Ministers of</hi> England <hi>may be so in the account of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That good men differ, is an argument of their ignorance and darkness, which though in some cases it excuses</hi> à tanto, <hi>yet not</hi> à toto; <hi>it may alter the degree, never the nature of the sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>'Tis false, that good men, pressing after reformation, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>As was said, The particulars instanced in, are commanded by Christ, or they are not; if they are (as hath been proved) doth it in the least discharge persons that conform not to them, from the charge they are impleaded as guilty,</hi> viz <hi>Non-conformity to the Laws of Christ; that good men differ in these matters</hi> (i. e. <hi>some good men transgress the Laws of Christ, which is sure no part of their goodness, nor any warrant to justifie me in the doing of what may strengthen their hands in such a Non-conformity.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. How far this branch of the Objection is to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in hand, is before shewed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>good men may do that which may be by consequence a denial of Christs Office,</hi> is granted, it being no more than that they may err and sin. That he grants some of the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> may be <hi>good men in the account of God,</hi> should have made him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to censure them so deeply as he doth, and to disswade men from hearing them, or joyning with them in Gods Worship, as being <hi>such as walk disorderly, even the best of them, as symbolizing with Antichrist, really denying Christs Kingly and Prophetical Office,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:100176:81"/>3. If there be darkness in others that dissent from this Author, so there may be in this Author; and considering the many learned Non-conformists, who have opposed the separation, such as <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw, Hildersham, Ames, Paget, Ball,</hi> and others; there is as much reason that this Author should ascribe darkness to himself as to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the <hi>difference among the good men pressing after Reformation, be not in the substance of the things instanced in,</hi> but in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; the more to blame is this Author for widening the Breach, and urging separation by reason of them. Pride, passion, self-interests we may more safely charge our selves with, than others; especially such as it <hi>cannot be denied, but that they may be in Gods account good men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. 'Tis true, the main matter to be discussed, is the thing it self, whether it be sin or no: which I have therefore endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to examine impartially, and do conclude, that in this Chapter it is not proved unlawful to hear the present Ministers of <hi>England.</hi> Let us consider the rest of his Arguments.</p>

Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the chief Magistrate or Magistrates of a Nation should give forth a Declaration of their Will, touching this or that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, were not persons Non-conformity thereunto (supposing it to be what lies within the verge of their Authority, and power to command, and may righteously be exacted of them, whose Conformity is thereunto required) a silent opposition of their Authority; but should any presume to give forth Laws of their own, without the least stamp of Authority upon them, yea, contrary unto the Statute and Declarations of their Governours; would not all conclude that these persons and their Abettors were guilty of Rebellion against their Rules, and did really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the lawfulness of their Authority? This is the present case, if men shall be found traversing paths, in the possession and practice of Orders and Constitutions that are foreign to the edicts of Christ, yea, contrary thereunto; shall we not as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally conclude that these persons are really opposers of his soveraign Authority and Government? doubtless so.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To the <hi>major</hi> proposition of the fourth Argument [<hi>Those
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100176:82"/>
that oppugn or deny any of the Offices of Jesus Christ, are not to be heard, but separated from</hi>] Answer is made before. The <hi>major</hi> of this argument here needs elucidation and limitation. <hi>Orders and Ordinances which not only are not of Christs revealing, but contrary thereunto,</hi> are not all of one sort. Some are in points of Faith, some of practice, some in things not fundamental, some in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. <hi>Owning, submitting, and subscribing to them,</hi> is either out of ignorance, inadvertency, infirmity through fear or some other motive, or voluntary, more or less, which may be aggravated by many circumstances and effects. Likewise <hi>the denying really, and opposing of the Offices of Christ,</hi> may be virtual or formal, directly or by consequence, by a factious setting up an open Antichrist, or by neglecting the proper Authority of Christ. It is true, every sin and every errour doth in some sort and degree oppugn the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ: Every disobedience to a lawful Magistrate, every subjection to an Usurper hath in it somewhat of denying or oppugning his Authority. Yet he that should deny, that for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry such sin or errour a person can be a good Christian, or for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry such disobedience or subjection a person can be a true subject, should too Stoically make a parity in sins, and neither hold good Divinity, nor teach good Policy. It is true, he that shall openly and factiously set up another universal Monarch of the Church, make other Mediatours to God besides Christ, teach any other way of justification than by faith in Christ, that shall expresly forbid the observation of what Christ hath commanded; as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the Lords Supper, or any other plain Command of Christ; such do deny really, and oppose openly the Offices of Christ. But there may be some errours in Faith, and teaching of some use in positive Rites, as may be a real denying or opposing interpretative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christs Offices, as in teaching Circumcision as necessary at that time, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.5. in owning, submitting, and subscribing to some use as may be not only not revealed by Christ, but also is by nearer or remote consequence a denial of Christs Offices; and yet the persons observing it, as <hi>v. g.</hi> the reservation of the Bread, in the Eucharist, sending it to the sick absent, as many did in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, either out of ignorance, fear, or such like motives, and yet these neither to be reckoned for such, as either in heart, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, or practice, deny the Offices of Christ, as enemies to him, nor to be shunned as such; but may be his true subjects though weak ones. <hi>Peters</hi> denial of Christ, his dissimulation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. shewed not enmity, but infirmity and instability. And many sincere Christians may out of errour or weakness teach, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100176:83"/>
many things not only a while, but also all their dayes, and that with much contention and zeal, which may inferr a denial of Christs Offices, or his Nature; as for instance, <hi>Lutheran</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantion, and yet are not to be judged opposers of the Kingly and Prophetical Offices of Christ, so as to be disclaimed, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from, and rejected as no true Christian Brethren, or Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. And therefore the <hi>major</hi> proposition here, may be variously conceived; and without some limitations and explications is not to be received. But he tells us:</p>

               <p n="1">I. That he hath misrecited the Canons in all or most of the 14 particulars alledged.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               </p>

In the 4. <hi>Canon,</hi> Ministers are not required <hi>to own and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a Liturgy, or prescript Form of Worship devised by men, and imposed solely by their authority, nor to tie themselves to it, neither diminishing nor adding in the matter or Form thereof:</hi> But it is judged <hi>a wicked errour to affirm, that the Form of Gods Worship in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>established by the Law, and contained in the Book of Common Prayer and Administration of Sacraments, is a corrupt, superstitious or unlawful Worship of God, or containeth any thing in it that is repugnant to the Scriptures; and it is required of such as have thus affirmed, that before their absolution from Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they repent, and publickly revoke it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In the third particular are sundry things liable to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is said that <hi>in the Book of Common Prayer, Bowing at the Name of Jesus is prescribed</hi>; which I find not there, but in the 18 <hi>Canon</hi>

strong of the Popish Leven, and is but one peg beneath the adoration of their Breaden God</hi>; when he might know, that not only the 28. <hi>Article</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Homily of the Peril of Idolatry,</hi> and the <hi>Apology of the Church of</hi> England, are fully against it, but also the Compilers of the Common Prayer Book, suffered Martyrdom for their refusal and abhorrency of such adoration; and in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the Common Prayer Book, as it is now established, after the Communion there is a clear and sufficient Declaration against it; which should, if this Author had dealt candidly, have been told ignorant people, who are drawn into a separation upon this suggestion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is true, that in the 36 <hi>Canon</hi> subscription is required to this Article, <hi>That the Book of Common Prayer, and of Ordering of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, containeth in it nothing contrary to the Word of God, and that it may be lawfully used, and that he himself will use the form in the said Book prescribed in publike Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments, and none other</hi>; which I take not to be the same with <hi>owning, submitting, and engaging to conform to all the Orders, Rites, and Ceremonies prescribed therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is said <hi>Canon.</hi> 32. <hi>The Office of a Deacon, is a step or degree to the Ministry, according to the judgment of the ancient Fathers, and the practice of the Primitive Church, and the subscription is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the</hi> 36. Canon <hi>to the Book of Ordination,</hi> as I have set it down here; but they are not required by that subscription to own this assertion, <hi>That the Office of a Deacon is the first step or degree to the Ministry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In the 49. <hi>Canon</hi> it is said, <hi>No person whatsoever, not exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and approved by the Bishop of the Diocess, or not licensed for a sufficient or convenient Preacher, shall take upon him to expound in his own Cure, or elsewhere, any Scripture, or matter, or doctrine:</hi> But they do not speak [<hi>though judged worthy of the Cure of Souls</hi>] they may have a Cure of Souls by indirect means, or by reason of the imperfection of the Law to debarr them, or by reason of the want of sufficient Preachers, as was in the beginning of the Reformation, or for want of maintenance for able Preachers to undertake it, who are not judged worthy of the Cure of Souls.</p>
               <p n="6">6, and 7. Neither of the Positions are Canons 49, 57. though their Ministration of Baptism and the Lords Supper is made suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>

It is not said, <hi>That Confirmation by Diocesan Bishops, is an Ordinance of God,</hi> but that <hi>it hath been a solemn ancient and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable custom in the Church of God, continued from the Apostles times, that all Bishops should lay their hands upon children baptized, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Catechism of Christian Religion, praying over them, and blessing them; which we commonly call Confirmation; and that this holy action hath been accustomed in the Church in former ages.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="11">11. <hi>The Bishop is to suspend according to Can.</hi> 68. <hi>Ministers refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to bury</hi>; but the lawfulness of it is not there asserted, though presupposed.</p>
               <p n="12">12, 13. <hi>Ministers preaching, administring the Communion in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houses, except in times of necessity; some appointing of Fasts, holding Meetings for Sermons, are forbidden, Can.</hi> 71, 72. but it is not there determined that they are forbidden, because of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness; Inexpediency, or inconvenience may occasion a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of that which is not unlawful.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Were all true which this Author hath alledged in these 14 particulars, yet it is not true which he saith, <hi>that either in the</hi> 36, <hi>or</hi> 38. <hi>Canon Ecclesiastical Ministers are to subscribe to, and own all these Orders and Ordinances, as agreeable to the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. To the Questions, <hi>Are any of these Ordinances and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the appointment of Christ? when or where were they institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him</hi>? I might answer by cross Interrogations, Are the Church-Covenant, gathering of Churches in the Congregational way, by severing choice Members from the rest, requiring an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the manner of their Conversion, making Election by the common Suffrage of the Members essential to a Minister, imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, tied to the Eldership of that Church; maintenance by Collection every Lords day, Excommunication by the <hi>major</hi> part of the Members, with many more of the Orders of Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Churches, Ordinances, and Constitutions of the appointment of Christ? when and where were they instituted by him? It is not I presume altogether forgotten, that such questions have been propounded to them by Mr. <hi>Ball, Apollonius,</hi> and many others, and their answers judged insufficient. And if they cannot shew Christs appointment for their Orders, which they require, why do
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100176:85"/>
they charge so deeply the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> as denying and opposing the Prophetical and Kingly Office of Christ, for submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Orders, which as well may be said to be of Christs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment as their own; or at least when they themselves may by the same reason be concluded to deny or oppose the same Offices? But for a direct answer, I grant they are not Ordinances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the appointment of Christ, and yet judge they may be submitted and conformed to, and required of Governours, while they are regulated by Laws of Ecclesiastical Policy, and do think that Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his three first Books of <hi>Ecclesiastical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy</hi> hath evinced thus much.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. To what is said, that <hi>these are Posts set by the Lords Posts, and thresholds by his thresholds (of which the Lord complains,</hi> Ezek. 43.8.) <hi>who sees not</hi>? I answer, <hi>Diodate</hi> his <hi>Annot.</hi> on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.8. is this, <hi>Their threshold] that is to say, they set their Idols, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their service in my Temple, in places and Chappels near to the places which are consecrated to my service. See</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 16, 14. and 21.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.3. and 23.39. and 44.7. All the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters I meet with, and the words themselves shew, that the thing complained of, was another thing than making Orders and Constitutions without revelation and appointment of Christ for Ecclesiastical Rule (such as those Constitutions in the Canons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are, which in Christian Churches have in like sort been made in the best times; yea, and some in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church without reproof;) to wit, Idolatrous practices by their Kings (such as <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Manasseh</hi> were) called <hi>Whoredoms, v.</hi> 7, 9. and <hi>abominations which they committed and defiled Gods holy Name</hi>; and <hi>for which be consumed them in his anger</hi>; and therefore tell this Author, that <hi>I see not</hi> those Ordinances he mentions to be <hi>Posts set by the Lords Posts, and Thresholds by his Thresholds, complained of Ezek</hi> 43.8. but rather think him in a dream or phrensie that saith he sees it. Yea further, if it were granted that the complaint were against their Act, as adding inventions of men to Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, yet this cannot be understood but of such as are made Gods Worship, or wherein that which God hath appointed is altered or corrupted. And therefore I conclude, that it is no small abuse of this Text, which occurrs in sundry printed Sermons and other Books to make every Order of men about Gods Worship, or the Governing of the Church to be thus branded, and out of all infer, that what he saith <hi>he hath evidently evinced,</hi> is but a vain brag of this Author. Let's proceed in viewing what follows.</p>

               <p>And this I conceive to be proved, 1. From Reason, because without such regulations, Church Societies can no more be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by reason of the difference of minds and capacities than other Societies, which is proved true by experience.</p>

For in that after all his discourse about ordering the use of their gifts, he ends with this general rule; he thereby shews, that more things were to be ordered by that rule, either by each one him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or by their Governours, as he himself did resolve, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34. and appointed <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> in the Epistles to them, and enjoyned obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.

                  <hi>Sect. 4.</hi> It's no derogation from Scripture, or Christ, that such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are made and obeyed.</head>
               <p>Answ. <hi>That there is any thing of moment in this Objection, though their</hi> Achilles <hi>in this matter, and that which they are upon every turn producing, is easily demonstrated. The whole of it being built upon as uncertain principles, yea, upon as notoriously false suppositions, as ever objection in so weighty a case was built upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis supposed that Christ hath not determined in the Scripture, how the affairs of his house should be managed with decency and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as well as commanded that they be so; which is:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>No small derogation to the perfection of the Scriptures.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Diametrically opposite to the Scripture instanced in, which stands as a two edged Sword to cut the throat of their cause, in its approaches thereto for shelter: of which take this brief account; The Apostle having in the beginning of the Chapter prest the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>to follow after spiritual gifts, but especially that they might prophesie; the liberty of the Saints therein being fully asserted, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral directions thereabout given, he condemns their disorderly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in respect of this important duty and priviledge,</hi> ver. 26. <hi>and gives direction touching its regular performance; and this he doth,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Particularly, by telling them how they ought to manage
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100176:87"/>
this affair in a way of decency, order, and edification; wherein se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral rules are comprised, too long to be here insisted on, as in cases of speaking in an unknown tongue,</hi> ver. 27, 28. <hi>of prophesying by two or three,</hi> ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29, 30. <hi>of the duties of women, with respect thereunto,</hi> ver. 34, 35. <hi>that from hence a power invested in the Church for the binding of the consciences of men, touching ceremonies in Worship, should be regularly deduced, is the first born of improbabilities and absurdities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Paul <hi>speaking by an infallible spirit of Prophecie, advises the Church of</hi> Corinth, <hi>that all things be done decently and in order; therefore persons that have not, pretend not to such a spirit, may of their own heads bind our Consciences by Laws and Rules of their own in the service of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Paul <hi>doth not only tell them, that all things ought to be done decently and in order; but discovers to them, wherein that decency and order lies; therefore the Church hath power to determine in this matter, are such</hi> Non-sequiturs <hi>as will not in haste be made good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, as the Argument is framed by me, there is moment in the objection, which is not built upon the principle he expresseth, but this; that however Christ hath not only commanded, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so determined in generals in the Scripture, how the affairs of his House should be managed with decencie and order; yet in many particularities he hath not determined how the Worship of God and Rule of his Church should be managed with decencie and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; as whether at the Communion there should be a Table spread with a linnen cloth, the Service begin with a recital of the Institution, or Prayer; Publike Prayer begin with Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin, or Thanksgiving, or profession of our faith; seating of persons in the meeting be with respect to their civil degrees, or sexe, or promiscuously; Sermon begin at the reading of the Text, and Prayer be after or before; these with many more are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate by Christ or his Apostles in the Scripture, and yet are to be determined according to the Rule of Decency and Order, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by each person himself in that which is private, or by Rulers in that, which belongs to the Community; and Obedience is due to the determinations of Rulers in these things. And it seems to me (to use this Authors own phrase) the first-born of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities and absurdities, that God should charge <hi>parents to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, Eph.</hi> 6.4.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100176:87"/>
that we should <hi>first of all make supplications, prayers, intercessions, giving of thanks for all men, for Kings, and for all that are in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.1, 2. that <hi>the Bishop should be one that takes care of the Church of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.5. If these have no power in the Worship of God, and rule of the Church to make Constitutions about things undetermined, or that they may without any sin be disobeyed. For as for the exception, as if such power reaches only to things Civil not Ecclesiastical, the contrary is proved by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Sanderson</hi> in his sixth Lecture <hi>about the obligation of Conscience.</hi> Nor is there any <hi>derogation to the perfection of Scripture,</hi> or <hi>the faithfulness of Christ</hi> by such a grant. For the sufficiency of the Scripture being in affording Doctrines of Faith and Rules of Life, if as <hi>able to make a man wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. its perfection is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, there is no lessening of its use, though it be said, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding its sufficiency to its end; yet Laws Domestical, Civil, National, Ecclesiastical, are necessary to be added for good order and Government. And the <hi>faithfulness of Christ, Heb.</hi> 3.2. is not placed in determining every particularity in Worship, (yea, he was faithful in that he did not) for then he should have put upon us such a yoke, as <hi>Moses</hi> bid, contrary to his Office, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. but in that he discharged the work his Father had appointed him as <hi>our High Priest,</hi> in suffering and interceding for us; and as <hi>the Apostle of our Profession,</hi> in teachinng us the counsel of God fully in the Doctrine of the Gospel, and that above <hi>Moses,</hi> as being not as <hi>a servant in Gods house</hi> only as <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>as a Son over his own house.</hi> And it is to be considered what Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, that if Christs faithfulness must have been extended to the determination of all particularities equally to <hi>Moses,</hi> he must have set down all particularities of Civil Government, as <hi>Moses</hi> did in the judicial Laws of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and so those Laws must be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (as some have attempted) and the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> must be evacuated; and a yoke put upon our necks, from which Christ hath freed us. And therefore a good Argument is hence deducible, that God would have the ordering of things undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined left to Governours, because otherwise Christ should not have been faithful as <hi>Moses,</hi> sith he hath not determined them; yea should have been unfaithful if he had, sith it was the Will of God that Christians should not have such a yoke of Rites put upon them, as <hi>Moses</hi> did put upon the <hi>Jews, Acts</hi> 15.9, 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

2, 3, 4. But the Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. requires more consideration, sith he saith it is <hi>diametrically opposite</hi> to that principle it is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to establish, which is but a meer Dictate of his, for which he brings no proof: For neither is his account of the Apostles disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation right, it being not true, that he <hi>asserts the liberty of the Saints in prophesying</hi>; as if prophesying were the liberty of the Saints as such, which was the peculiar gift of Prophets, <hi>v.</hi> 31, 32. which now the Saints have not, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> can now claim, as many do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogantly, as if it were their liberty, inferring from <hi>v.</hi> 3. that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is said, <hi>he that prophesieth, speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort</hi>; therefore every one that speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is like as if, because it is said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. <hi>charity edifieth</hi>; therefore it should be inferred, that whatever edifieth is charity; nor is it right, that the Apostle, <hi>v.</hi> 40. <hi>represseth his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, v.</hi> 26. that being another direction, and a general one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and besides the particulars, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 28, 29, 30, 34, 35. Nor if it were as he saith, is there any thing to prove, that all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar wayes of Decency, Order, and Edification, are there set down; or that none are permitted to the care of After-Rulers. Nor is the Argument, as I have framed it, evacuated; who have not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prove thence <hi>a power invested in the Church for the binding of the Consciences of men, touching Ceremonies in Worship,</hi> but do wave the controversies about the Ceremonies of the Cross, Surplice and Kneeling; about which the Writings of Bishop <hi>Morton, Burges, Ames,</hi> and others are extant; nor do I alledge the words as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> expounds them, rendring <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to appointment</hi>; in which he is opposed by Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi>: but only thus argue, There's a general rule after divers particulars instanced in, left by the Apostle in the close of his dissertation, which were of no use, if he had set down all wayes of Decency and Order, and left none to be determined by others; therefore yet there remain particularities of Decency and Order about Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worship and Church-Rule to be determined by men: which that it belongs to Rulers, I gathered from other places. As for the Arguments as he frames them, I know none that avows them, neither do I think any doth express himself thus, <hi>Paul speaking by an infallible spirit of Prophesie adviseth the Church of Corinth</hi>; for though I doubt not but <hi>Paul</hi> spake by an infallible Spirit in that advise, yet that is fitter to be termed Apostolick than of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: nor do I conceive any of them whom he opposeth would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100176:88"/>
thus conclude, <hi>Persons that have not, pretend not to such a spirit, may of their own heads bind our Consciences by Laws and Rules of their own in the service of God:</hi> nor do I think any would say, <hi>Paul doth not only tell them, that all things ought to be done de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and in order; but discovers to them, wherein that decency and order lies.</hi> For they conceive this false, except about the point of Prophesying in that place, and that the Apostle gives only a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, and leaves the particularities of Decency and Order to be determined by others, chiefly Rulers: nor would they thence inferr, therefore <hi>the Church hath power in this matter</hi>; but rather thus plead, That which belonging to Decency and Order is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in general, but not in the particularities determined, is in respect of Communities left to be determined by their Rules: but so is the Apostles command, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. Therefore, &amp;c. The <hi>major</hi> rests on this, That what is to be determined in or for a Community, is supposed to belong to their Rulers. This Author goes on thus:</p>

of Decency and Order not determined in Scripture may by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to that end, be prescribed; the general rules in Scripture, the Laws of Nature, Right Reason, other laudable Customs and just Laws being duely observed; and that persons are to obey them, not as bound in conscience directly, and by the things themselves, but indirectly and by accident,; because appointed by Rulers, to whom God requires obedience in those things: which being rightly understood, both horns of the <hi>dilemma</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, they being bounded in the Scripture, in the general are to be obeyed as other humane Laws; and the particularities not being there determined, the wayes of Decency and Order not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Scripture, are to be received: and yet it follows not that whatever Ceremonies Rulers introduce not directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Scripture, must be subjected to; much less a fair inlet made to the whole <hi>farrago</hi> of Popish inventions. For if indirectly they be contrary to Scripture, or otherwise hurtful, or not subservient to the ends of such Laws, or become by reason of their number or imposition, such a yoke as Christ hath freed us from, there may be a relaxation from them, more than from other humane Civil Laws; and for all, or some of these reasons, the whole <hi>farrago</hi> of Popish inventions is to be excluded, though other Ecclesiastical Laws of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be subjected to.

               <p>To which I answer, The Church of <hi>England</hi> was assembled at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1603. in its several members by deputation freely to debate things, as was the usage in the Synods of ancient and later times, and even in <hi>New England</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> there about the Antinomian opinions in Mr. <hi>Welds</hi> History; in <hi>England</hi> in the Assembly at <hi>Westminster,</hi> of the Congregational Churches by their <hi>Elders and Messengers in their Meeting at the</hi> Savoy, <hi>Octob.</hi> 12. 1658. which kind of Meeting must be allowed as the Meeting of the whole Church, which they represent, there being no other way, in which orderly many particular Churches throughout a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can convene and debate freely, either points of Doctrine or Discipline, than by such Deputies; and therefore as the whole Kingdom is said to meet in the Parliament, so the whole Church may be said to meet in their Synod. Nor is there any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20 or 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. unless it be supposed, that all those must meet to debate matters of Doctrine and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100176:90"/>
who did then meet for worship, which is not to be said: For then in such things women also must have a voice contrary to the Apostles resolution, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. and the practice of all the Churches.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That which the present Ministers own and subscribe to, as containing in it nothing contrary to the word of God, and that it may lawfully be used, with promise to use it, is the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer. This Author impeacheth it as contrary to the will of God, and not to be lawfully used under the New-Testament dispensation. 1. Because there is a prescript From of words in prayer. 2. The worship is Ceremonious. 3. That it is Pompous. 4. Devised by man. 5. Abused to Idolatry. What part of it is, or was abused to Idolatry should have been expressed. If he mean kneeling at the Lords Supper, that is his tenth instance to be considered again, if that which is said already in answer to this Chapter <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. be not sufficient; if he mean the whole Book, because out of the Popes <hi>Portuis,</hi> that is answered before, in answer to Chap. 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. His allegation of <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.26. seems to be brought to prove it unlawful to use any thing in the worship of God abused to Idolatry. But it is so impertinent, that were any conscience made how Scripture is applyed, or shame to abuse Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with texts impertinent, it had been omitted; it being only a prediction of the ruine of the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> not of the Temple of the Idol, that it should not be built again, by reason of the Opression and Idolatry of the Inhabitants, not a prohibition to the Jews, that they should not use the stones of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to build a Temple to God at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> because abused to Idolatry. Why the worship of the Common Prayer is termed Ceremonious, or Pompous, is left to be ghessed. If he mean it, as it is used in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals and Collegiate Churches and Chappels, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution for it as such, to which Ministers are required to subscribe; if because of the ceremony of the Surplice and Cross, and the Singing of Psalms; or because it is with external words and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, the first of these being an adjunct only to the Minister, doth not make the Worship it self Ceremonius or Pompous; and the second being only a monitory sign annexed to a rite of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is not fitly termed Worship; the third methinks should be

allowed, as commanded <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. external words and gestures if agreeable to the examples of holy men should not be excepted against, nor are they contrary to <hi>John</hi> 4.23. which excludes only the legal shawdowy worship of the Law, and that which is only external, and so hypocritical; otherwise external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is required, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. But I suppose the chief exception is, that the Ministers own and use a prescript Form of words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised by man; which he conceives contrary to the other texts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him, how pertinently, is to be considered. To <hi>Mat.</hi> 15 9. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. answer is made Chap. 1. Sect. 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. requires <hi>Teachers to teach Disciples of Christ to observe all that he hath commanded</hi>; But proves not, that no prescript Form of Prayer devised by man, may be lawfully used. For then it would follow, that conceived Forms of Prayer may not be used, for they are devised by men, they are not immediately from Gods Spirit, as is apparent by the phrases, and matter oft times used; nor are they commanded by Christ, but rather a set Form is commanded, to wit, the Lords Prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. and therefore the use of a prescript Form of words in Prayer devised by man, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christs revelation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. For all that Christ hath commanded, may be observed by those who use it; and it is more agreeable to Christs command, to use one prescript Form of words of Prayer, which he hath directed <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. is more impertinently alledged: For it is not said, <hi>The Spirit helps our infirmities,</hi> by suggesting to us the Form of words we shall use: but by <hi>making known what things we shall ask</hi> in his secret impulse on our spirits, not in ordinary motions of our tongues, and by exciting in us <hi>grones and sighes that are unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>; and therefore this text is so far from proving, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to use a prescript Form of words in Publick Prayer, because of this promise of the Spirit to suggest without meditation, such words as shall be spoken, that it is quite another thing which is here meant. First it is not meant of publick Prayers, but of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret private Prayers: Secondly, it is not meant of private ordinary Prayers; but as <hi>Cameron</hi> in his <hi>Treatise of the nature and condition of the Church,</hi> observes, <hi>The Apostle distinguisheth some, and those singular Prayers of Believers from the rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, when the minde constituted in anguish, and the same erected by trust in God, prayes, as wrapt beyond it self; such as were Moses his Prayers, who when he is not said to have prayed in Scripture, yet God so be speaks him, as if he had cryed; to wit, the Spirit did pray in Moses, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding prayed not: the Spirit, that is, the understanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100176:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not distinctly the prayers. And</hi> 1 Cor. 14.15. (which is the other place cited by this Author) <hi>I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the mind. To wit, I believe none sings with the will; for to sing is a work of the understanding; but the Apostle hath oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Spirit to the Understanding; because the Spirit in that place signifies the Understanding so affected, as that it cannot distinctly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what it hath conceived. Therefore in the same Chapter above he exhorts, that he who speaketh with tongues (that is with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) pray that he may interpret; that is, not only speak with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit but also with the Mind.</hi> Therefore it is manifest that the prayers <hi>Rom</hi> 8.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. are meant of such as are in extraordinary raptures and ecstacies, such as the Prophets sometimes had; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3, 4. and cannot be applied to the ordinary publike prayers of the whole Congregation. Thirdly, <hi>the help of the Spirit</hi> cannot be meant of suggesting a Form of words, because it is said, <hi>the spirit it self maketh intercession for us with groans unutterable; and</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. is such <hi>praying in the spirit</hi> as may be <hi>without the understanding of him that prays or others,</hi> even such as he <hi>that occupieth the room of the unlearned cannot say</hi> Amen <hi>to, seeing he understandeth not what the Speaker saith.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>The praying with the Spirit</hi> is such as is <hi>unfruitful</hi> of it self, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and not to be affected of it self, nor can be a matter of duty, sith it is <hi>motus liberi spiritus,</hi> as the School-men speak rightly, <hi>a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the free Spirit,</hi> such as <hi>lumen propheticum, prophetical illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> is, which is such a gift as that it may be our duty to use it when we have it, not our duty to acquire it. Upon all which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons it is apparent, that these Texts are much perverted against the use of a prescript Form of words in Prayer devised by man, because of the <hi>Spirits help, Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>praying in the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 15. sith they cannot be meant of ordinary publike prayers, and of praying in words unpremeditated, as immediately suggested by the Spirit of God.</p>

The sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Acts</hi> 19 9. is nothing to countenance the separation from the Service and assemblies of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for that separation was not because of the presence of professed Christians of vitious life; but because <hi>of divers who were hardned and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not, but spake evil of the way of Christ before the multitude,</hi> and so endeavour to disturb them in the practice of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The words 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. whether we read it, <hi>be not unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yoked,</hi> or <hi>unevenly ballanced to the other side with Infidels</hi>; and whether we expound it of marriage, or familiar converse, or (as the words <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols,</hi> do plainly evince it to be meant) do not joyn with the Idolaters in their Idol Temples to eat there things offered to Idols, which

he had forbidden, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7, 10. <hi>to partake of the table of Devils,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. it is manifest from, <hi>v.</hi> 15. to be meant of professed Infidels opposite to him that believeth, and therefore cannot be understood of not joyning in prayer and the Lords Supper with a professed Believer, though of vitious life. Nor can <hi>the separation from among men, v.</hi> 17. be understood of any other than professed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; nor the <hi>the touching the unclean thing</hi> be any other then joyning in service of Idols mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 16. and therefore is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly impertinent to the separation from Believers by profession in the service of God by reason of their personal wickedness. The last Text 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. is less to the purpose: For what shew of consequence is there in this? Christians <hi>glorifie God for others professed subjection,</hi> or <hi>the subjection of their Confession,</hi> or <hi>consent to the Gospel of Christ</hi>; therefore <hi>wicked persons, and such as consent not willingly, are not to be taken for lawful members of the Church, nor may be compelled thereto.</hi> It is added:</p>

The chief difficulty is concerning, 1. The Translation of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. 2. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the appearance of evil which we are to abstain from, and how far we are by that precept bound to abstain from it.</p>

               <p n="3">3. For <hi>the appearance of evil that we are to abstain from,</hi> it may be doubted whether it be meant of an appearance in doctrine or
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100176:96"/>
in practice. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and the <hi>Greek Scholiast,</hi> and others apply it only <hi>to false doctrines, or lies of false Prophets</hi>; as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle had said, though you are <hi>not to quench the spirit,</hi> v. 19. <hi>nor to despise prophesyings,</hi> v. 20. yet you are <hi>to trie all doctrines,</hi> and <hi>to hold that which is good,</hi> v. 21. and <hi>to abstain from that doctrine which appears evil.</hi> Against this Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> only objects, that <hi>an accurate and exact coherence is not necessary in those short precepts:</hi> and <hi>to understand the words of appearance in practice also suits well with the coherence.</hi> Which I will not gain-say: but only say if this be granted, yet if the Interpretation <hi>of abstaining from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil in practice,</hi> be not necessary, but that it may be limited to doctrine, the allegation of it to prove that kneeling at the Lords Supper is an appearance of evil, from which we are to abstain, is not cogent, sith it is not in a point of doctrine to which this text may be limited, but in practice; of which it is uncertain whether this Text be meant, and therefore is <hi>not directly opposite to it,</hi> as is here asserted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Were it granted that this Text is meant of <hi>the appearance of evil in practice,</hi> to which it is not denied Interpreters of all sorts do apply it, yet it may be doubted whether the Apostle means it of that which appears evil to another, or to a mans self. Surely the words and <hi>series</hi> of the Text do best suit with this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Abstain from that which appears to your selves to be evil.</hi> For having said, <hi>try all things,</hi> whether doctrines you hear taught, or practices to which you are moved by your own thoughts or others examples or perswasions, to direct them what to do; he adds, <hi>hold that which is good,</hi> that is, what you find upon trial to be good, and <hi>abstain from all evil appearance,</hi> or <hi>appearance of evil,</hi> which so appears to you upon your trial. Which sense, as it hath the concurrence of good Authors, so doth it seem to me to be the genuine meaning of the Text.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it best suits with the coherence and scope of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. For it is plain that the Apostle makes these two precepts of <hi>holding that which is good,</hi> and <hi>abstaining from every appearance of evil,</hi> the consequents of <hi>trying all things,</hi> to which it tends: For to what end should men <hi>try all things</hi> whether doctrines or practices, but that they may <hi>hold the one,</hi> and <hi>abstain from the other</hi>? now as it is undoubted, that they are to hold fast that which upon trial appears to themselves to be good, not what appears to another: for to what purpose should they themselves trye, if they must hold what others think good, and not themselves? So for evil, they should abstain from what appears evil to themselves who try, not what so appears to others.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:100176:97"/>2. The absurdities which follow on this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I must abstain from all that appears evil to another, seem great and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because it would require an impossible task: For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for me to know what appears to another evil, sith I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know his thoughts, and therefore cannot discern what appears to him good o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> evil: nor, if I could know somewhat that appears evil to another, is it possible for me to know all that so appears? and yet the Apostle requires me <hi>to abstain from all appearance of evil,</hi> and that without exception of any man. Which is made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, if understood of appearance to others in respect of the thing; abstaining from all that appears evil to another being impossible, without destroying our being, the eating of our meat, clothing of our bodies, and doing other necessaries for our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, appearing evil to some or other, either out of ignorance, hatred, prejudice, superstition, envy, or some other malignant quality, though the thing we do were never so right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Treatise of <hi>Scandal, p.</hi> 9, 10. observes, <hi>that appearance of evil is so uncertain and unconstant a thing, that to abstain from it</hi> universim, <hi>cannot be the matter of any possible command,</hi> and that <hi>which is of ill report with one, or of evil appearance to one, may be of good report, and appearance of good to a thousand others,</hi> is considerable. For then a person must either do nothing, or act that which is appearance of evil to some, when it appears good to others and to himself, which must of necessity create innumerable perplexities, or rather impossibilities, if the Apostles precept be so understood. Nor am I satisfied with what Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> saith, <hi>This fear will quickly vanish and be discovered to be idle and vain, when anon we shall explain that distinction of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil into real and imaginary.</hi> For (besides that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that no appearance of evil to another, can be said to be real, <hi>per se ex natura operis, from the nature and condition of the fact it self: when that of it self, and in its own nature, is a very probable sign of evil,</hi> as he explains it, <hi>p.</hi> 82. but that which is from actions of themselves sinful, and then we are not to abstain from them as appearances of evil, but as evil: all other appearances that are from actions lawful or indifferent, are but <hi>imaginary</hi>; that is, <hi>from others misconceits and censures thereupon,</hi> and so his distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as to this thing, is rather to be accounted vain and idle, than the fear he mentions) were the distinction good, yet <hi>the fear will not quickly vanish nor be discovered to be idle and vain,</hi> sith if we must abstain from all appearance to others of our evil, we must
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100176:97"/>
abstain from all appearance of evil, whether it be <hi>real from the condition of our work of it self,</hi> or <hi>imaginary by accident through others interpretation,</hi> which must cause perplexities unavoidable without number.</p>
               <p>Yea, 3. That may appear to be evil to others which is our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary duty, as Christs doctrine and actions did to the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> the Apostles preaching to the <hi>Jews</hi>; yea, to good men, as <hi>Peters</hi> going in to <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 11.1, 2. the Magistrates punishing some vices according to his duty, may seem evil to good Subjects, the obeying Laws of Governours, Commands of Parents and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters do often seem evil to some that are sincere-hearted, but weak in judgment; yea, the necessary defence of truth may be opposed and appear as evil to godly, learned, and otherwise judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines. If we must abstain from every appearance of evil to others we must abstain from these duties; Gods Laws will cross one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and we must infringe or suspend one, or otherwise be necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to sin: Governours must revoke their Laws, and Subjects cease to obey Gods Laws; and so all confusion and Anarchy must follow.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Were the precept so meant, that we must abstain from every thing of ours, which is an appearance of evil to another, our Christian liberty were evacuated; there being nothing we do which will not appear evil to some or other, and many things lawful and indifferent, will appear evil, even to the best. Its true there are many cases in which we are to forbear our liberty; of which, before Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> his first Edition of his Treatise, I wrote in the fourth Chapter of my Book of <hi>Scandalizing,</hi> but the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our liberty I did not ascribe barely to the appearance of evil to others, but to the scandal; that is, ruine or harm to another consequent thereon. And to prevent the frequent abuse of the Text, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.22. I wrote thus, <hi>p</hi> 284. Lastly if it were granted that the Apostle for bids us to abstain from all that which appears to be evil to another, yet no Interpreter that I meet with, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands it of such appearance of evil, as is conceited to be such upon some erroneous principles in him that conceives it to be such: Or by reason of the meer phansie, or rigid austerity, or evil will, or such like cause of him that thinks it evil: but they usually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to such causes or signs of manifest evil, as are means of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some notorious sin; as going to hear a Mass, which is a cause and sign of Idolatry; or wanton dalliance, which is a cause or sign of whoredom. And they apply hereto that saying of <hi>Julius
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100176:98"/>
Caesar,</hi> that <hi>Caesars wife should be free not only from evil, but also from the suspition of it.</hi> So that even in their intent this Scripture is not appliable to this purpose; as if the Apostle did prohibit a Christian to use any thing that another thought evil, whether he thought so upon probable reason or no reason, upon some ground or none. And to speak truth, the application of this Text in that manner, as it is by some, as if the Apostle did forbid us the use of any thing though in different in it self, when it appears as evil to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any further restraint, is very absurd and so unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as that it will bring a yoke upon mens consciences impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be born, sith there is scarce any thing a man can do, but some or other Infidel or Christian, weak or strong in the faith; Orthodox or Superstitious, will think it to be evil; that saying by experience being found true, <hi>quot homines tot sententiae, so many men, so many minds</hi>: nor shall a mans own Conscience only make a thing evil to him but the conscience of any other man in the World. Out of all which I gather, that the Ministers tenent or practice in receiving the Lords Supper kneeling, is not <hi>directly opposite to this positive precept, as being what hath an appearance of evil in it,</hi> unless it be in it self evil, or evil in their own opinion, or else a probable sign and cause of their adoration of the Papists Breaden god. Whereas this Author himself in this Chapter, <hi>p.</hi> 40. <hi>does not say, though some would say, that kneeling at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per smells very strong of the Popish leven, and is but one peg beneath the adoration of their Breaden god.</hi> In answering which passage, <hi>sect.</hi> 2. of this Chapter, I shewed, that it could not be taken for such by any that will candidly and charitably interpret their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as for other reasons very clear and convincing, so from the words of the <hi>Rubrick at the end of the Communion,</hi> which I here sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn. <hi>Whereas it is ordained in this Office for the administration of the Lords Supper, that the Communicants should receive the same kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (which Order is well meant, for a signification of our humble and grateful acknowledgement of the benefits of Christ therein given to all worthy r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ceivers, and for the avoiding such prophanation and disorder in the holy Communion as might otherwise ensue) yet, lest the same kneeling should by any persons, either out of ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, or out of malice and obstinacy, be misconstrued and depraved; it is here declared, that thereby no adoration is intended or ought to be done, either unto the Sacramental Bread and Wine, there bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or unto any corporal presence of Christs natural flesh and blood. For the Sacramental Bread and Wine remain still in their very natural substances, and therefore may not be adored (for that were Idolatry to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100176:98"/>
be abhorred of all faithful Christians.) And the natural body and blood of our Saviour Christ are in Heaven, and not here; it being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth of Christs natural body, to be at one time in more pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then one.</hi> Thus the Common Prayer Book. That which is said, that <hi>the receiving of the Lords Supper kneeling, is a gesture used by the Papists in the adoration of their Breaden god,</hi> is denied by Dr. <hi>John Burges</hi> in his Treatise of the <hi>lawfulness of kneeling in the act of receiving the Lords Supper, cap.</hi> 21. <hi>p.</hi> 67. <hi>&amp; p.</hi> 479. of the Rejoynder, where he thus saith: <hi>With us the Bishops or Ministers communicate kneeling as well as the people: But with the Papists, the Pope, when himself performeth the office, receiveth sitting, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a type of Christ, the Mass Priests receive standing reverently, by the Canon of the Mass</hi>: and for this he cites in the Margin, <hi>Ord.

I deny not the errour of their minds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that they received into their mouths. But I deny, that they ever intended adoration of the species at that moment of time when they took it in their mouths: But then turned themselves to God rather, to give him thanks, which was not uncomely.</hi> Of which he gives three reasons. 1. <hi>Because it was never yet enjoyned by any Pope that they should then kneel.</hi> 2. <hi>In the Mass there is no direction for adoration of the Sacrament when it is received.</hi> 3. <hi>For that it is an incongruous thing in their superstition, to adore a thing which is not higher than their polls when they adore it, because they cannot be said to humble themselves to that which is lower than they can cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> (To this last reason nothing is returned by Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in his <hi>Triplic. ch.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 429. and <hi>Dallaeus adv. lat. cult. l.</hi> 9. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>Id quod adoratur eo, à quo adoratur celsius ac sublimius aliquid esse debere insito à natura ipsa sensu omnes mortales confitentur, at<expan>

And for that which is said, that <hi>the Lords Supper is to be received kneeling, is directly opposite to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Churches of Christ, for several hundred years after Christ, to the time of the invention and introduction of the Popish

                  <hi>To all that hitherto hath been offered in this matter, we shall yet add, as a further demonstration of the truth we are in the disquisition of.</hi> Arg. 3. <hi>Those that acknowledge another Head over the Church beside Christ, deny his Prophetical and Kingly Office: but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Ministers of</hi> England <hi>do own and acknowledge another Head over the Church beside Christ: Therefore. If the assertion of another King in</hi> England, <hi>that as the Head thereof hath power of making, and giving forth Laws to the free-born Subjects therein, be a denial of his Kingly Authority (as no doubt it is) the</hi> major <hi>(or first Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) cannot be denied. If Christ be the alone King of his Church (as such) he is its alone Head and Lawgiver.

                     </gap>tain this Headship may do; as it's evident many Popes of</hi> Rome <hi>(the great pretenders hereunto) have done.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100176:100"/>
whatever respect, homage, or duty, by the Laws of God or Man, may righteously be expected from us. But this will not, we humbly conceive, in hast be performed; and that because</hi> 1. <hi>The Scripture makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of no other Head, in and over the Church, but Christ, Ephes.</hi> 1.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.23, 29 2 Cor. 11.2. 2. <hi>If there be any other Head, he must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be within or without the Church: The latter will not be affirmed; Christ had not sure so little respect unto his flock, as to appoint Wolves and Lions to be their Governours and Guides in matters Ecclesiastical, nor can the former; for all in the Church, are Brethren, have no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over each others Faith or Conscience,</hi> Luke 22.25. 3. <hi>If any other be Head of the Church but Christ, then is the Church the Body of some others besides Christ: but this is absurd and false, not to say im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and blasphemous.</hi> 4. <hi>There was no Head of the Church in the Apostles dayes, but Christ.</hi> 5. <hi>If any be Head of the Church beside Christ, they either have their Headship from an Original Right seated in themselves; or by donation from Christ. To assert the first, were no less then blasphemy; if the second, let them shew when, and where, and how they came to be invested in such a right, and this Controversie will be at an end.</hi> 6. <hi>He that is asserted in Scripture to be the Head of the Church, is said to govern, feed, and nourish it to eternall life, is her Spouse and Husband,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.2. <hi>In which sense, none of the Sons of men, one or other, can be the Head thereof; and yet of any other Head, the Scripture is wholly silent. But of this matter thus far. It cannot by any sober person be denied, but an owning of a visible Head over the Church, having power of making and giving forth Laws with respect to Worship (such an Headship not being of the institution of Christ) must needs be a denial of his Soveraign Authority and Power.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Author in this Argument, seems to me, to hide his meaning, as they say the Fish <hi>Saepia</hi> doth, by casting out some black colour, whereby the water is infected, and she not discerned. <hi>A Headship over the Church besides Christ's,</hi> he makes the present Ministers to acknowledge in some of the sons of men, but who they are he means, what the Headship is, and how it is opposite to Christs Kingly and Prophetical Office, is not plainly expressed; nor in what Subscription, Oath, or Conformity they own, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it. Headship is a Metaphor, and sometime notes Originati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vital influence, direction or guidance, superiority, power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or government, which may be in many things. No Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster I think gives such a Headship to any of the sons of men, as to Christ over his whole Body, either so as to derive their being members, having their faith, or eternal life, or dominion over their Consciences, or Sovereign power, authority to rule or dispose

of soul or body, as Christ hath: And that which the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> claims over the Universal Church, is utterly disclaimed by the present Ministers.

What Headship is ascribed to the Bishops, or Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in making Laws or Constitutions about Worship, to wit, the accidentals thereof undetermined, in order to the orderly decent performance of it to edification by the present Ministers, hath been examined all along in the answer to this Book, specially to the 4. and 5. Chapters, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. and as yet no such Headship is proved by this Author to be ascribed by the present Ministers, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a denial of the Prophetical and Kingly Offices of Christ: that the taking of the Oath of the Kings Supremacie, or submission to his Edicts about matters of Worship, is not owning such a Headship, is further to be cleared. And first I deny his <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, That those who acknowledge another Head over the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side Christ, by acknowledging the King as Supream Governour in Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Ecclesiastical or Spiritual</hi> (as the Oath of Supremacy is proved by me in my Book of the <hi>Serious Consideration of the Oath of the Kings Supremacy,</hi> ought to be understood) <hi>particularly that he, or with him the Bishops or Convocation, may make Laws or Constitutions in the accidentals of Worship undetermined in Scripture, observing the rules of Order, Decency, Edification, deny Christs Prophetical and Kingly Office:</hi> and to the proofs of it, I answer: This Author doth most injuriously suppose the power and authority asserted to the King of <hi>England</hi> in the Oath of Supremacie, to make Laws or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons about the Worship of God with the Counsel of a Synod, or
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100176:101"/>
Convocation, or Parliament, is making another King besides Christ over his Church. For there is no such thing acknowledged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, which is proper to Christ; <hi>to wit,</hi> to be the universal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the whole Church, to prescribe what Faith or Worship shall be given to God, to be Infallible Interpreter of Gods Will, and the Supreme Judge and <hi>Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy</hi>; or which is arrogated by the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by <hi>Hart</hi> the Jesuite, in his <hi>Conference with Dr.</hi> John Rainold <hi>in the Tower of</hi> London, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>div.</hi> 2. in these words. <hi>The power which we mean to the Pope by this title of the Supream Head is, that the Government of the whole Church of Christ throughout the World doth depend of him: in him doth lye the power of judging and determining all causes of Faith; of ruling Councils, as President, and ratifying their Decrees; of Ordering and Confirming Bishops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors; of deciding Causes brought him by Appeals from all the coasts of the Earth; of reconciling any that are excommunicate; of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, suspending, or inflicting other censures and penalties on any that offend, yea, on Princes and Nations; Finally of all things of the like sort for governing of the Church, even whatsoever toucheth either Preaching of Doctrine, or practising of Discipline in the Church of Christ.</hi> Which his practice sheweth to be such as to dispense with the Laws of God, as by legitimating incestuous Marriages, relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of lawful Oaths, granting Indulgences, releasing out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, Canonizing of Saints, Consecrating of things for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of Devils, with many more; and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I challenge our Author to produce any one testimony of Scripture, or any one word out of any general Council, or any one Catholick Father or Writer to give the least Countenance to his assertion of two Heads of the Church in his sense; an Head of Influence, which is Jesus himself; and an Head of Government, which is the Pope, in whom all the sacred Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy ends: This taking of one half of Christs Rule and Headship out of his hand, and giving it to the Pope, will not be salved by that expression thrust in by the way under him; For the Headship of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, is distinctly ascribed unto Christ; and that of Government, to the Pope; which evidently asserts, that he is not in the same manner Head unto his Church in both senses, but he in the one, and the Pope in the other.</hi> I add that Mr. <hi>Philip Nye</hi> in his Book <hi>of the lawfulness of the Oath of Supremacy, and power of the Civil Magistrate in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical affairs and subordination of Churches thereunto,</hi> Printed 1662. though not published, hath these words, <hi>p.</hi> 46. <hi>For Persons and Causes Spiritual or Ecclesiastical, that are properly and indeed such; as first Table-duties, which contain matters of Faith and Holiness, and what conduceth to the eternal welfare of mens souls: an interest and duty there is in the Civil Magistrate</hi> more su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Concerning which Supremacy, if what I have written in the little Treatise Printed 1660. intituled, <hi>A serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Oath of the Kings Supremncy,</hi> in the proof of the fourth and fifth Propositions, be not sufficient to produce from the Scripture, the institution of such an Headship with the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions annexed thereunto; methinks Dr. <hi>Rainold</hi> his argument, which convinced <hi>Hart</hi> in the conference with him, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. <hi>div.</hi> 1. and such other writings as have been written by <hi>Bilson, Mason, Bramhall,</hi> and many more, should have prevented this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny of making thereby another head besides Christ equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to a denial of his Kingly Office. And to his Objections, I answer, 1. to the first, That we use not the title of <hi>Head,</hi> but <hi>Supreme Governour</hi>; yet when it was used, it meaning the same, it might be used as it was given to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17. though not as it it is given to Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.22. <hi>and</hi> 5.23, 29 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. Nor is the title of <hi>Head</hi> so appropriate to Christ, but that it is given to the Man over the Woman, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. to the Husband over the Wife, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.23. and may, in a qualified sense in respect of Government, be given to the King over the Church in his Dominions, as to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17. to the chief of Families, as Parents or others of greatest authority or esteem; as <hi>the heads of houses,</hi> Exod. 6.14. in which sense Parliament men, Judges, Ecclesiastical Governours, may be termed Heads of the Church or State they represent, or are subject to them. To the second, though <hi>all in the Church are Brethren, have no domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Apostles sure had power over the members of the Church to <hi>command,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.10. to <hi>give orders,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.1. to <hi>judge,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.3. though no superiority over one another. And though

the King, and Bishops, or Convocation are Brethren; yet are they Superiours, Rulers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. and though they have no dominion or authority over each others faith or conscience, so as that their Laws shall bind the conscience immediately, and must be obeyed as precisely and fully, as the Laws of God and Christ; yet their Laws, Edicts, Commands, Canons, or Rules, even in the worship of God, in things unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by God, and according to such Rules, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture directs them to observe, bind in some sort the conscience; as the commands of Parents and Masters by virtue of the authority given them by God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.13, 14, 16, 18, 19. though not in respect of the things commanded by them. To the third, the Church is not the body of any other than Christ as joyned to any, or depending on any, or subject to any absolutely as unto Christ; yet may particular Churches in respect of that Ministration and Government which their Governours afford them, be said to be the bodies of their Governors, as a wife is in some r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To the fifth, their Headship is by donation from Christ in the places often alledged; and in answer to the sixth, though not as Christ is termed the Husband of Believers, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. can any be termed Husband, nor to govern, feed and nourish to eternal life, as Christ by influence of his Spirit, or power to give eternal life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 17. <hi>John</hi> 17.2. nor their Father, as God is said to be <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.13. yet the Apostles and all others may be in a qualified sense, who are instruments to convert or build up others by the Word or Discipline, be termed their Fathers in Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 15. and to govern, feed, and nourish them to eternal life, as 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.7, 11. the Apostle saith of himself: Whence I conclude, in answer to his major, that notwithstanding what he hath said, it may by a sober person be denyed, that an owning of a visible head, or heads over the Church, having power of making and giving forth Laws with respect to worship, as the King, Parliament, Bishops, or Convocation do, may be no denial of Christs Soveraign authority and power.

Those who obeyed the Laws of <hi>Richard</hi> the 3. of <hi>England,</hi> did not thereby acknowledge him to be the King of right: nor do all that submit to the decrees of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, or the Popes Edicts, either own the one or the other as being just, or the power as rightly claimed: but for peace sake submit to what they cannot remedy.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The term [<hi>Head of the Church</hi>] is not used in the Oath of Supremacy, but <hi>Supreme Governour</hi>; and this is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. and how out of these and other Scriptures, his Government is proved in that sense, in which it is asserted by the Ministers, is shewed by me in my Book of <hi>the serious consideration of the Oath of the Kings Supremacy</hi> in the proof of the fourth and fifth Propositions; and if <hi>the Church as the Church</hi> be comprised under <hi>every soul, Rom.</hi> 13.1. they are Governours of the Church as the Church; that is, as they are a Company of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not as if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that Kings had a lawful power to prescribe another Faith or Worship besides Christs; but as Physitians are said to be subject to the King as Physitians, because he can prescribe rules with penalties in the use of that Art they practise, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his <hi>Aphorisms</hi>; so the King is Governour over the Church as such, by prescribing rules about the profession and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of that Faith and Worship they learn only from Christ, in things undetermined by him, and serving for the ends which they are to aim at. Nor do I perceive that in so doing any more i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100176:104"/>
it is more absurd to ascribe such a power to the Church over the Church as such, than to ascribe it to the King; it being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of Governours and Governed, Head and Body, which were monstrous. 2. Though I deny not that the <hi>Headship pleaded for by the Church of</hi> Rome, is pretended to be <hi>under Christ,</hi> and the Pope terms himself <hi>Vicar of Christ</hi>; yet it is in the foregoing <hi>Section</hi> shewed, that they usurp a power not only equal, but in some respects rather superiour to Christs, in their dispensing with the keeping of lawful Oaths, and allowing of incestuous Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, none of which is claimed by those whom the Ministers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge as Heads besides Christ; and therefore it is false, that <hi>the Headship pleaded for by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>is no other than what the Ministers own.</hi> 3. His proofs have been examined before, and shewed defective. 4. The terms <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> being used on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly metaphorically; there's no more monstrosity in making <hi>a Head under a Head,</hi> than in making a Governour under a Governour, used by St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1 <hi>Epist</hi> 2.13, 14. or making more Fathers of the Church one under another.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That there is any such disproportion between the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of the Law and Gospel, as makes the same power, which the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> exercised lawfully, to be now unlawful to the

Hugo Grotius</hi> in his Book <hi>De Imperio sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum potestatum circa sacra,</hi> and others. 2. It is true, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is made a type of Christ, but that all the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> much less, that all the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> are made types of Christ; or that Christ alone was to have that power which they used, or that the Kingly Power used by them, ceased upon the coming of Christ in the flesh, are all most palpably false; sith the Scriptures of the New Testament do plentifully assert the Dominion of Civil Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and our Lord Christ himself, and his Apostles yielded subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them. 3. That the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> was different from the Kingdom or people of <hi>Israel,</hi> is one of the <hi>Placita</hi> or proper o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of those who would establish from that example an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Independent Government in the Church distinct from the Civil Government of the State. But neither the arguments of Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> in his <hi>Aarons Rod blossoming, Book</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3. nor any other I have met with, convince me that it was so. Sure both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and other Kings did exercise power over Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as in deposing <hi>Abiathar</hi>; and in Ecclesiastical things, about keeping the Passover, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. &amp; 30.2. and many other things, which were approved by God, being related in the holy Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without reproof, as arguments of their integrity. And therefore if the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> were, as it is said of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17. <hi>heads of the tribes of Israel,</hi> they were also heads of the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> being Governours of the same persons, whether of the tribe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> or of other tribes, and about the same things, to wit, those of the Worship of God, though they were not to meddle with the peculiar Ministry of the Priests and Levites. It is true, that <hi>God alone was the Head and King of the Church of Israel</hi> in some sense.

time <hi>through his counsel cause the committing of a trespass against the Lord, as in the matter of</hi> Peor, Numb. 31.16. <hi>hold the doctrine of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, <hi>who taught</hi> Balack <hi>to cast a stumbling block before the children of</hi> Israel, <hi>to eat things sacrificed unto Idols, and to commit fornication,</hi> Rev. 2.14. or as <hi>Caiaphas being high Priest that year,</hi> at one time <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie that Jesus should die for that Nation, and not for that Nation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that also he should gather together in one the children of God, that were scattered abroad.</hi> Joh. 11.51, 52. At another time say, that <hi>Christ had spoken blasphemy, Mat.</hi> 26 65. Such a one may be heard &amp; joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with in the former, though not in the latter. Whence it follows, that it is not the Character or property of the man, who is a false Prophet, or a false Priest, that is the reason, why he is not to be heard, or is to be separated from; but his false doctrine, and his evil counsel, whereby <hi>he seeks to thrust us away from the Lord our God,</hi> Deut. 13.2, 6, 10. or <hi>the damnable heresies denying the Lord that bought them,</hi> as it is 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>turning the grace of God into lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness, and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ, Jude</hi> 4. that do denominate them false Prophets or false Priests, and bind us to a refusal of hearing them, or joyning with them in that Communion, in which we cannot partake without fellowship in their errour, false Worship, or other sin. And this is it, which is to be collected from the Texts alledged; not that we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to hear persons, or separate from them because of their perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal vices, or irregular obtruding themselves into their places; but in respect of their pernicious Doctrine, and impious Worship, by which we are in danger to be ensnared and defiled. We are bidden, <hi>Beware of false Prophets, Mat.</hi> 7.15. but no where is any called <hi>a false Prophet,</hi> but from his false Doctrine. And therefore though his counterfeit shews of Piety be mentioned as the bait to catch men, yet the false doctrine is the hook they are to beware of; as in like manner St. <hi>Paul</hi> warns, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17, 18. and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. And thus in the places cited, where Christ bids <hi>take heed that no man deceive them</hi>; he alledgeth the reason: <hi>For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many,</hi> Mat. 24.4, 5. and v. 23. <hi>If any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there: believe it not, for there shall arise false Christs, and false Prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders, insomuch that (if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) they shall deceive the very Elect,</hi> v. 24. <hi>the false Prophets that were gone out into the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.1. were they that <hi>confessed not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,</hi> v. 3. the person <hi>not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into house,</hi> 2 Joh. 10.11. is he that <hi>brought not the doctrine of Christ,</hi> v. 9. that <hi>confessed not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,

who is the Deceiver and Antichrist,</hi> v. 7. those that the <hi>Ephesian</hi> El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were to <hi>watch against,</hi> Acts 20 31. were <hi>grievous wolves that should enter in among them, not sparing the flock; and men arising of their own selves, speaking perverse things to draw away Disciples after them,</hi> v. 29, 30. And thus farr I agree to the <hi>major</hi>; let us see how he proves the Ministers to be such.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A man that meant honestly, and had any spark of charity, justice, or ingenuity, would not charge so deeply the whole order of men throughout a Nation containing many thousands of men of years, breeding, parts, and by reason of their Calling to be reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced; and some of them, by his own Confession, good men; as being false Prophets, who by the Law of <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 13.5. were

to die, and as false Priests without some irrefragable proof, unless he had learned that accursed art of him in <hi>Terence, Calumniare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacter, aliquid haerebit</hi>; or having once past the bounds of modesty were resolved to be <hi>gnaviter impudens.</hi> But I must confess, that however he thinks, that <hi>by a serious observation of the characters, which are given in the Scriptures by the Holy Ghost, it will be made exceeding perspicuous and evident</hi>; yet to my understanding he hath made neither of his charges perspicuous or evident in any degree. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. His charge is against all the present Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore his proof should have been of that, which all, even the best of them are guilty of, taken from that which they all unanimously agree in and practice; and not from things which may perhaps be personally objected against some, but not against the whole order.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Characters which he gives should have been such as are convertible, so as that it may be truly said, all that have these Characters are false Prophets and false Priests, and all false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and false Priests have them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He should have told us, whether each of these is convertible, or all of them, if not which they might have and not be false Prophets.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His proof being of matter of fact, should have better testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony then his own assertion or interrogations, that may be denied.</p>
               <p n="5">5. His Characters are such as perhaps the Ministers may tell him, <hi>Physitian heal thy self, Novimus &amp; qui te</hi>— We can prove, if not the same, yet as bad Characters or properties of false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or false Priests in those you allow to be heard even in your Instituted Churches, though we rake not up out of the ashes what was charged on the <hi>Brownists</hi> of old, or of late by <hi>Edwards, Bailey,</hi> and others on the <hi>Independents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. That which is the chief Character of a false Prophet, 2 <hi>Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 2.1. and other passages before recited, <hi>the bringing in damnable Heresies, denying the Lord that bought them,</hi> is wholly omitted, without which, what else he chargeth them with, will be insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove them false Prophets, or to warrant the refusal of hearing them: But will occasion the Ministers to charge him with the Schism of <hi>Donatists</hi> of confining the Church and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry to their party, and if these things be done with a factious unquiet spirit (as they take them to be) tending to hinder the good of souls in not embracing their Ministry, and the peace of

both Church and State: with a fury like that of the <hi>Circumcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or at least an humour of reviling or uncharitable censuring. But whatever were the Authors motives, I shall examine them as they are presented, because this argument (if it were made good) is <hi>instar omnium,</hi> and the only genuine reason, why the present Ministers should not be heard.</p>
               <p>For the first, I grant that <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23 21. is <hi>a signal character of a false Prophet,</hi> and that a <hi>mission from the Lord is of the essence of a lawful Ministry, that whoever wants such a mission, is no Officer of Christ, but a false Prophet and Minister of Antichrist; and that this exactly accords with what is asserted by the Apostle,</hi> Rom. 10.15. But I deny,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That by the sending here is meant the mediate regular out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the regular outward mediate calling is only <hi>from a rightly constituted Church of Christ</hi> in his sense; that is, after the Congregational way, or <hi>by succession from the Church in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi>; that is, such as have been separated from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> after its Apostasie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That either an immediate, or such a mediate mission, are of the essence of a lawful Minister.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That any of these can any way be deduced from <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21. or <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I say, it is contrary to his own grant <hi>ch.</hi> 2. <hi>to make an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mission of the essence of a lawful Minister,</hi> sith he expresly allows <hi>gifted Brethren, who have not such mission, to Preach, and to be heard.</hi> As for inward immediate calling, he is no judge of it; and it may be as well acknowledged in the Ministers, as in his Gifted Brethren. As for the Texts, it is clear from the text it self, that <hi>their running before they were sent,</hi> was in that they Preached in Gods name, what he did not command or deliver to them; so that their false Prophecying was not for defect of outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but for their taking upon them to deliver that message as from God, which they received not from him: Which the words plainly shew, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.21.22. <hi>I have not sent these Prophets, yet they ran</hi>; which is explained by the next words, <hi>I have not spoken to them, yet they Prophesied</hi>; and in the next verse, <hi>But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they,</hi> &amp;c. where their not being sent of God, is expressed by <hi>Gods not speaking to them; their not standing in his Counsel; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his people to hear words which were not his</hi>; termed after, <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>Prophecying lies in his name; v.</hi> 26. <hi>Prophets of the deceit

of their own heart,</hi> ver. 30. <hi>stealing his words every one from his neighbour,</hi> ver. 32. <hi>prophecying false dreams,</hi> ver. 36. <hi>perverting the words of the living God.</hi> All which passages, and the whole Chapter shew, that their <hi>running when God sent them not,</hi> was not in that they had not an outward calling, but in that they prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied that, as from God which they had not from him, but was of their own invention, lies, perverting Gods word: and that this is meant by <hi>not sending,</hi> is manifest in that, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. these are put as equipollent, <hi>I sent them not, nor commanded them,</hi> and v. 38. <hi>I have sent unto you, saying, ye shall not say the burden of the Lord</hi>; where <hi>sending</hi> is expressed to be <hi>saying what they should not speak.</hi> Which might be further proved out of <hi>Jerem.</hi> 14.14. and the plain words, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 28.9. <hi>The Prophet which prophesieth of peace when the word of the Prophet shall come to pass, then shall the Prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him.</hi> Whence it is plain, that the mission of God is known by the word delivered: which if it be according to Gods minde, a person cannot be judged a false Prophet, nor without mission from him. Nor can <hi>the sending, Rom.</hi> 10.15. be otherwise meant. For the words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, a person <hi>cannot preach except he be sent.</hi> But this is not true of mediate outward calling, for those that <hi>were scattered went every where preaching the word,</hi> Acts 8.4. and so do gifted brethren without such a calling. But he is not sent who doth preach an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Gospel, and he is sent who doth preach the Gospel, as the words following intimate, <hi>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things</hi>? Which I would not have understood, as if an outward regular calling were not necessary for him that takes on him the publick function of preaching, or that every one were to be permitted to do so that did intrude into it: But that the speaking of Gods word whether in private or publick, is with such a mission as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits him that preacheth it from being a false Prophet, and the hearer from transgressing the precept, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Beware of false Prophets.</hi> What he said before against the Ministers mission, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. is answered before. What is <hi>pleaded about a succession from the Church of Rome</hi> is represented by many that understand not the occasion and plea, as odious, and a proof of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism of their calling. But they who peruse what Mr. <hi>Francis Mason</hi> against <hi>Champney</hi> and others, who have answered the Papists question, Whence had the Protestant Ministers their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? have written, will be otherwise minded.

Hebr. <hi>committing Adultery, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a lye; that is, at full, committing they commit Adultery; and walking, they walk about with lyes: they make a common trade and practice of either: a form, though defective, yet very signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, see on</hi> Isa. 59 11.13. <hi>See these two vile practices joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the false Prophets again,</hi> chap. 29.23. <hi>For those that here
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100176:109"/>
restrain the term of Adultery to Idolatry, spiritual Adultery, seem therein to wrong the Text.</hi> Now if this be the meaning of the committing Adultery, it may be a signal character of a wicked man, but not of a false Prophet as such. But if it be understood of spiritual Adultery, every <hi>departure from the wayes and instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Lord in worship to be devices and inventions of men,</hi> is not in this Prophet, nor in any other, termed <hi>committing Adultery</hi>; but when that Divine Worship which is appropriated to God is given to that which is not God, as may be shewed out of the 2. and 3. Chapters of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> where ch. 3. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. it is said, <hi>they committed adultery with stocks and stones,</hi> Ezek. 23.37. <hi>with Idols.</hi> Now if he can prove that the present Ministers do thus commit Adultery, are Idolaters in their Worship, I will yield, they and their Worship are to be separated from; and if they teach it, not to be heard. What he saith he hath proved before, is answered before; what he saith in the next Chapter, will be then discussed. The words in the Margin may be right, yet impertinent. As for <hi>walking in lyes</hi>; I grant it to be a signal character of a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, understanding it of lyes in doctrine opposite to the principles of Theology: and if he can prove the present Ministers do walk in such lyes, I shall yield them to be false Prophets, and not to be heard: But yet he hath not done that, nor goes about it. That which he produceth out of <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.15. <hi>Amos</hi> 2.4. <hi>John</hi> 8.44. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.11. proves not every device and invention of men in worship to be meant by lyes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.14. <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.15. <hi>By lyes some understand their Idols, some their treachery in dissembling and compliance with the adverse party, some their crafty shifts and wily devices. Mr</hi> Gataker conceives, <hi>most likely their strength raised, and wealth gotten by fraudulent and deceitful courses,</hi> Amos 2.4. <hi>Diodati Annot. Their lyes] namely, their Idols, false worships and superstitions,</hi> John 8.44. is meant of any lyes, but chiefly that which is opposed to the truth of Gods word in the Gospel, not meant as this Authour applies it. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.11. is manifestly understood of a <hi>lye</hi> opposite to <hi>the truth by which they might be saved,</hi> that is, the Gospel, <hi>v.</hi> 10.12. and so notes anti-evangelical doctrine, though I deny not the <hi>whole worship of Antichrist being patch'd up with such dirty inventions may be so called.</hi> But to his Queries I answer. To the first, <hi>which of the Institutions of Christ have not the present Ministers mixed with their inventions</hi>? 1. It concerns him that accuseth to shew which they have so mixed. 2. That I think the Institution of preaching the Gospel, which is that about which is the present question, they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100176:110"/>
have not so mixed. Sure, if they preach such doctrine of Faith as they subscribe to, they do not mix their doctrine with their own inventions; yet, if any do, while <hi>he holds the foundation,</hi> though he <hi>build some hay and stubble</hi> he is not to be charged to <hi>walk in lyes.</hi> I conceive the Preachers of the Congregational Churches have been as guilty of <hi>Antinomian, Arminian,</hi> and other errors as the Prelatical. To the 2. <hi>From how many have they gone a whoring?</hi> 1. It concerns him that accuseth to shew. 2. They have not gone a whoring from the Lords Supper to the Mass, by Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and the unbloody propitiatory Sacrifice for Quick and Dead, and adoration of the breaden-god. To the third, <hi>Is not a great part of their Worship drops of the Whores Cup of Fornication and shreds of the great lye of Antichrist? The whores Cup of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and great lye of Antichrist,</hi> are according to <hi>Brightman, Mede,</hi> and others their idolatries in Invocation of Saints, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping Images, Reliques, the Crucifix, the Host, in their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies about Justification, Merit, the Popes Supremacy, and other points of the <hi>Trent Council.</hi> A great part of the worship of the Ministers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is in their prayers to God, their praises of God in Psalms, and Hymns, in their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and instructing of the people. Let this Author shew any part of this worship of the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> to be a <hi>drop of the Whores Cup of Fornication, or a shred of that great lye of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> even according to the exposition of the Authors named, or any other sober Author; yea, though he be biassed towards the Congregational way, such as Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Parker,</hi> or any other of that party, or else let him be branded <hi>lege Remnia,</hi> as an egregious Calumniator. As for that inserted passage [<hi>'twere well if upon some of them it had not a litteral accomplishment</hi>] it had been honest dealing, if he knew any, that he had either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them or complained to their Superiors, but thus obliquely to insinuate it to the Readers, too apt to entertain any suggestions against the present Ministers, whether true or false, was neither the part of a charitable Christian, nor of a candid Moralist.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100176:110"/>
the Judgments of God against the transgressors of his Law, as much as any; but alas, what is this, to condemn them in the state where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they stand, without repentance to the pit of Hell, in the Pulpit; and by and by to saint them in the Chancel, and tell them there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, that the Body of Christ was broken for them, his Blood shed for them? O how many millions of souls are and have been thereby hardened to their own undoing, and their hands strengthned in wickedness? What should I mention their admission of the Children of all to Baptism, without exception, their owning them as Church-Members; yea, die they never so wickedly, as Brethren, of whose joyful resurrection they profess they have a sure and certain hope; thereby proclaiming their undoubted perswasion, that they are a people in covenant with God? not to take notice of the terrible reflections, and uncharitable censures are publickly past by them upon men truly fearing God, because they cannot conform to them: How desparately are the hands of the wicked hereby strengthned? so that none indeed doth return from his wickedness: How rare a thing is it to hear of one soul that is brought over to God by all their preaching? so that visibly that judgment of God seems to be upon them,</hi> ver. 32. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they shall not at all profit this people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>They confirm them in their wickedness, and so keep them from repentance, by bearing them in hand, that they shall do well enough, whatsoever Gods messengers tell them, that though they do continue in their sins</hi>: see Ezek. 13.22. is Mr. <hi>Gatakers</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase of this passage of the Prophet. And this Author is not ashamed to say, <hi>that the present Ministers of</hi> England <hi>really do so, is capable of an ocular demonstration,</hi> when his next words acquit them, <hi>Perhaps they do in their Sermons reprove sin, thunder out Gods Judgments against transgressors of his Law as much as any</hi>; if so, they do not <hi>strengthen the hands of evil doers by bearing them in hand, that they shall do well enough, though they do continue in their sins:</hi> And that, which he acknowledgeth they do, is enough to acquit them from that character of the false Prophets here charged upon them, which perhaps might more truly be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to those, who have taught <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Antinomian</hi> errors, which have been too rife in the Congregational Churches. In the point of Baptism I can acquit the one no more than the other, nor will I justifie the censures of men truly fearing God; I have some grounds to think that it is oft a matter of mourning, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the present Ministers, but also to some of the Bishops, and that they wish, that there were a remedy in that, and in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of many ignorant and evil doers to the Lords Supper,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100176:111"/>
and they conceive by the warning before the Communion, the enlargement of power to the Minister in the Liturgy, as now it is, in the joynt confession of Sin, and preaching before the Communion, besides conference, and examination, which may be used to redress it, some provision is made against it, however Laws restrain them from doing more; which being made against Recusant Papists, are thought fit to be continued, though used concerning others who are not such. That expression of <hi>the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christs Body for them, and shedding his Blood</hi> is known to be but a charitable speech, upon the supposal of the persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith (the truth of which is above the Ministers cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance) professed by them, they use; and if <hi>Judas</hi> were at the Lords Supper, it was used by Christ; and being understood as those speeches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Through thy knowledge shall thy weak brother perish, for whom Christ died.</hi> Heb. 10.29. <hi>Hath counted the Blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing,</hi> are not liable ro exception. If any do undoe themselves by mis-understanding it, the same thing happened to Christs hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>John</hi> 6.61<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 66. and is to be remedied by expounding the meaning, and warning persons, that they do not abuse it to their destruction. That the Ministers <hi>own men as brethren, die they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so wickedly,</hi> is not true, if by legal censure or judgment they are declared criminal; if not, the Ministers are not allowed to exclude persons from brotherhood upon their own opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof and judicial sentence; if they do call them brethren, so all men are; and those that profess Faith, may be charitably accounted Christian Brethren. In the words used at Burial, the Minister doth not <hi>profess, he hath a sure and certain hope of the joyful resurrection of all them</hi> that are interred; but the words are, <hi>in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life</hi> without application of it to the person then to be interred; and therefore these allegations are too short of proving <hi>Ministers strengthening the hands of evil doers as false Prophets.</hi> If their success in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be not as were to be wished, it is the same that the Prophets complained of, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.4. <hi>Isa</hi> 53.1. and was verified of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 12.37, 38. And if it fall out, that people are hardened notwithstanding their Ministers do preach, as here its not denied they do, it is from themselves; and I wish their hardening and destruction be not to be charged on this Author, and such others as are of the separation, who, by declaiming against them as <hi>Antichristian,</hi> alienate the spirits of people from them, so as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to hear the word; which I count a most pernicious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100176:111"/>
in whomsoever, though reputed Saints. And though there is too much cause to bewail, that there is so little effect upon the preaching of the present Ministers, yet sure to argue thence that they are not sent of God, but are false Prophets, is altogether inconsequent. Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> in his <hi>justification of separation,</hi> p. 306, 307. speaks better than so, when he saith, <hi>It is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that whosoever converteth a man unto God, that person doth in truth and in deed, Minister the word of God, and the spirit by the word, and so may be said to be sent of God. In that general and large sense, wherein Mr.</hi> Bernard, <hi>p.</hi> 313. <hi>expounds the word, Sent or Apostle, I do acknowledge many Ministers in</hi> England <hi>sent of God; that is, that it comes not to pass without the special providence and ordination of God, that such and such men should rise up, and preach such and such truths for the furtherance of the salvation of Gods elect in the places, where they come,</hi> But this Accuser adds.</p>

they are to be accounted false Prophets.

If <hi>men of greatest parts and holiness</hi> on one side, <hi>have been the most ready to strike in with, preach up, and plead for, what was suitable unto the spirits of such upon whom they have had dependance:</hi> may it not be said so of men of the greatest parts and holiness of the Congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al party, that they have been liable to the like? It were well if both parties would search themselves, and not be so forward to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse each other. As I conceived long ago in my printed <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of glorying in men,</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. so I am still by much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience confirmed, that the so termed <hi>Professors of England</hi> out of their injudiciousness, and partial affection have done much hurt to themselves and the Church of God, by looking upon, glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, adhering to some as <hi>of greatest parts and holiness</hi> with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of others; whence evil surmizes, censurings, divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from them that are disaffected, swallowing down without chewing, what those utter whom they follow; which hath been a temptation to Teachers to vent such things as were not right, for the retaining of their followers, and a trap whereby their hearers have been ensnared to their own and others no small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness.

a perfect harmony betwixt these false Prophets and the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of</hi> England <hi>cannot be denied; what means else their frequent calls, from places of less, to places of greater value; their gaping and greedy desires after preferment; the vexations they put poor men to, that cannot in conscience put into their mouths preparing War against them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ. Isa.</hi> 56.11. may be understood as well of the civil Magistrate as the Minister; and of neither is it a Character of a Minister not to be heard, as being a false Prophet, nor of an usurper or unlawful Magistrate, that is not to be obeyed. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.19. notes a Character of a false Prophet, but the proper character of him as such, is not that <hi>he prophecied for handfuls of Barley, or pieces of Bread,</hi> but that <hi>they polluted God among his people by lying to them. Micah</hi> 3.5. is a character of a false Prophet, in that they <hi>made Gods people to erre, their preparing war against him that put not into their mouth</hi> is a common accident to corrupt men, not a property of a false Prophet; and in like manner the <hi>Prophets di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vining for money,</hi> ver. 11. or the <hi>Priests teaching for money</hi> no more proves a false Prophet or false Priest, then <hi>the heads judging for reward</hi> proves them false heads: these are their personal vices, which may be in a true Prophet, as in <hi>Judas,</hi> and in a true Priest, as <hi>Hophni,</hi> or in a true head, as in <hi>Jehoiakim, Jer.</hi> 22.17. and so are impertinent to prove a Minister a false Prophet. Nor is it any more to the purpose what is in the Margin, sith he that <hi>preacheth truth with respect of reward or gains,</hi> may be a true Prophet, though not a good man; and so they <hi>that preach for their bellies sake,</hi> though if they preach not according to the word of God, but <hi>after the prescript of man,</hi> for the matter of their doctrine they may be false Prophets: but this is not so much as offered to be proved concerning the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi>; and therefore it is untruly said, that it <hi>cannot be denied that there is a perfect harmony between them, and those false Prophets.</hi> As for their <hi>removals from places of less to places of greater value,</hi> it is a thing which may be objected to Preachers and Pastors of the Congregational Churches, and may be upon just cause, and therefore of it self proves not so much as a covetous minde: whether it be out of <hi>gaping and greedy desire after preferments</hi> God may be the only judge. If <hi>preparing War</hi> be meant of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their dues by Law, it may be just; nor is a Minister bound to live upon alms, or voluntary contribution; the Elders of the separated Churches have found by experience how great a misery it is for a Student though godly and painful to live of the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100176:113"/>
of their Churches; nor is it any sin for a Minister more than for another man to make use of the Magistrate and Law to gain his due, according to the Law of the Land. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever some have instilled into peoples heads the unlawfulness of requiring or paying Tithes, or other dues to the present Ministers, as they did before to Non-Conformists; yet there is no colourable plea for not paying them, it being not unlawful for me to pay what is unjustly demanded, there being therein no doing of wrong, though there should be a suffering of wrong. And therefore it is but vainly pretended, that they <hi>cannot in conscience put into Ministers mouths,</hi> when there is no appearance of sin in doing it; and if their Consciences be misled by erroneous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suists, <hi>poor men</hi> may thank them for their vexations, and beware of hearkening to them, and not clamour against the Ministers as the only cause of their trouble; if out of meer obstinacy they deny to pay, they are to blame themselves. It is added.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That they sadden the hearts of the righteous,</hi> Ezek. 13.22. <hi>what need I turn aside to make application of this to the Prophets of this day? who that is serious, doth not experiment the truth thereof in his own soul? to see the Name and Ordinances of God prophaned, the ceremonies and inventions of man subjected unto, by such as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Ministers of Christ, would make an heart of stone to bleed; much more those whose hearts are made tender by the Lord. Those of our Brethren that as yet attend upon their Ministry, will tell us, they are troubled at their compliance and conformity—All that look in the least after reformation, say, they could wish it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; so that this character also is visibly upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer. By lyes sadning the hearts of the righteous,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22. is granted to be a character of a false Prophet, but this Author omits that, and makes that a character of a false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet which is not, and applies that to the Ministers which he goes not about to prove they are guilty of. Perhaps those righteous persons he means are sadned out of mistakes, as conceiving the Name and Ordinances of God prophaned when they are not; as the <hi>Israelites</hi> were when they mistook the <hi>Reubenites</hi> fact in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Altar, <hi>Josh.</hi> 22.11, 12. Perhaps it may be without their fault, perhaps the Ministers are sadned as well as they, perhaps the sadness is from such erroneous suggestions, as are instilled into the people by such as hold the same principles of separation with this Author; perhaps men as righteous, as they who are sadned, do without any sadness attend upon their Ministry; perhaps they are sadned that they stumble at that they need not; perhaps they
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100176:113"/>
are more sad at such principles of division as pervert them that are counted otherwise righteous than at any thing they perceive practised by the Ministers of <hi>England.</hi> If <hi>sadning the hearts of righteous by the inventions of men</hi> be a character of false Prophets, and that for it the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> are to be judged such, the renting of errors and fancies which have been in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches, and even by their Teachers, the many unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary scruples, janglings, oppositions, arrogant, wilful carriages, deceitful and unrighteous dealings in Members, which have sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the hearts of many sober, and better composed spirits, and made them weary of their societies; the heart bleedings for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors abominations are indeed as signal characters of false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in their Churches, as of the Ministers in the Church of <hi>England</hi> being such. Though there were an utter oblivion of what of old was done by Separatists in <hi>England,</hi> the Low Countries, in new <hi>England</hi>; yet what hath been done in <hi>England</hi> in our times, and is yet in the memory of many yet alive, should have stopped this Authors mouth, and made him forbear to object that against the Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> which may perhaps more fully be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted on those whose Ministry he would have attended on.

               <p>It follows 9. <hi>That they put no difference betwixt the Holy and Prophane,</hi> Ezek. 22.26. <hi>Do not even the Ministers of</hi> England <hi>the same?

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The charge, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.26. is against the Priests of the Law accusing them of <hi>neglecting to discern between clean and unclean Offerings,</hi> as <hi>Piscator</hi> in his <hi>Analysis. Grotius, They made not them to understand, to wit, the difference, from that which was common. They are the very words from</hi> Lev. 10.10. <hi>where they are commanded to do what here they are said to have neglected. That is holy which is dedicated unto God: Profane which is in common use. Polluted which is forbidden to be eaten; clean which it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to eat.

And for not doing this, the Priests are blamed,</hi> Ezek. 22.16. <hi>see also</hi> Lev. 20.25. <hi>holy] Heb. holiness: mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of persons, and things. In Greek, Between the holy ones and the profane</hi>: which Texts and others, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 22.1, 2, 3. shew that this thing was an evil indeed of a <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest, when either they admitted unclean and profane Offerings of Beasts or Fowls, or legally unclean persons; or taught not the people to put dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them; yet was no Character distinguishing a false Priest from a true, though it shewed him to be negligent.

They tell us 'tis our weakness and distemper that we conform not to their worship; that we are persons gone astray: we profess to them, that we would not give way to spiritual distempers, nor stray one step from the wayes of God might we but know it; we would thank any to convince us of our mistakes, and reduce us to the true sheepfold, if we are gone astray: Do they seek after us, in a spirit of tenderness labour to convince us, and carry us in their bosomes, like tender Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds to the true fold? What less? With force and cruelty they rule over us, threaten us with Excommunications, Imprisonments, Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, dispoiling us of what God hath graciously given us, yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning us to death: in all which (through the grace of God) we can rejoice, though they thereby abundantly demonstrate, that they are the successors of the false Shepherds here spoken of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though <hi>Diodati,</hi> the <hi>Annotator</hi> in the <hi>large Annotations, Junius, The Marginal Notes of the Geneva Translation,</hi> say, <hi>he meaneth by Shepherds, the King, the Magistrates, Priests, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>; yet after <hi>Piscator, Grotius,</hi> and others, I think this passage is only appliable to the Kings and other Civil Rulers of <hi>Israel,</hi> the Prophets not <hi>ruling over the people with force and cruelty,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiling them with lies and deceit. Which with sundry more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the Chapter upon my reading of it do convince me, that this Author doth misalleadge it, sith the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> are not Successors of the Civil Magistrates, nor are the Prince and Governors here termed <hi>false Shepherds,</hi> but negligent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful; which are not the signal Characters of a false Prophet, or false Priest, and therefore this Text is impertinent to prove the Ministers to be such. As for the practice he chargeth the Ministers,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100176:116"/>
with, sith it is in generals, a distinct answer cannot be made to it, nor can any but the accused well answer it. Possibly that which this Author counts <hi>force and cruelty</hi> may be necessary, though se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere discipline. I do not justifie the neglects or menaces men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in any; nor is it unlikely, but that there are men of violent spirits in the Hierarchy and Ministry of <hi>England,</hi> to whom this evil is imputed: nor do I think this Author can acquit all those that are Elders or other members of the Congregational Churches. <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acos intrà muros peccatur &amp; extrà.</hi> It is to be lamented that such sad things should happen as he recites. For my part I have, even when the Congegational men had most liberty, had conferences with persons, in which I shewed my dissent from them in respect of the Separation with my Reasons, and have often in writing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered their Arguments for it, which I can yet produce, yet found them still inflexible. This writing was begun by me out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of those, to whom I was once a Preacher, whom I found seduced by it, and have endeavoured without any bitterness to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this Author of his mistakes, yet I doubt whether he will thank me for it. I rather expect to be told for writing this Book, as I was for writing of some other pieces, that I am an Apostate, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizer, flatterer, adversary to the Saints, and such like imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They that know what hath been done in <hi>New-England,</hi> and old <hi>England</hi> even at <hi>Oxford</hi> to Quakers for inveighing against their Teachers and Governors should be somewhat more moderate in censures of the present Ministers and Governors; who when they read this very Chapter will be apt to think, that the soul of the Quakers is by transmigration gotten into this Author. My Prayer to God is, that on all sides there may be such a calm and considerate spirit, that we may forbear one another, and in love endeavour the rectifying of each other, not <hi>bite and devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lest we be consumed one of another,</hi> and so we be <hi>Homo homini lupus,</hi> not Shepherds.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Though the Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> be a holy Divine wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and hath been of great use to support the spirits of Christians under the great Persecutions, which have befallen them, and is still of very great importance for the animating of believers either to patience in sufferings, or watchfulness in time of temptation; yet such abuse there hath been made of it to uphold many wild con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, many irregular practises; notwithstanding the confessed obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the frequent refutation of such conceits, as men have with much confidence delivered, by the manifestation of their vanity in the event; that sober men have wished it were either less read by some, or more, considerately weighed, and more warily applyed. The passages here alledged have been so abused by men of opposite parties against dissenters, especially by those of the separation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst not only the Prelates and Prelatical Preachers, but also the Presbyterian, that they have served for no other purpose but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the minds of one against the other. <hi>The first</hi> and <hi>second Beast, Rev.</hi> 19. are differently conceived. Dr. <hi>Hamond</hi> conceives the first <hi>Beast to be the Heathen Roman Emperors upholding the Idol worship, the second Beast the Augurs, Priests, and Magicians, such as Apollonius Tyranaeus</hi> was, &amp; so conceives the accomplishment already past. The Author of an <hi>Essay on that part of the Revelation,</hi> which begins at chapter the 13. conceives it meant of one to come. <hi>Molinaeus</hi> in his <hi>Vates,</hi> l 5. c. 17. with <hi>Mede,</hi> and others, understand it of <hi>the Pope</hi> and <hi>Roman Clergy.</hi> There is no probability, that this second Beast should be meant of the Hierarchy and Ministry of <hi>England,</hi> or that they should be the <hi>false Prophet</hi> mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. which is said <hi>to work miracles before the Beast,</hi> and <hi>with the Beast was cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone:</hi> which to say of men, of whom some he acknowledgeth to <hi>be good men,</hi> is so horrid an imagination, as had not this Author been transported with extreme passion, me thinks he should have trembled to have let it enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his thoughts, much less to have written and printed it. Nor can
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:100176:117"/>
the conceits be free from these and such horrid consequences, that then the <hi>first Beast</hi> must be <hi>Civil Powers,</hi> and <hi>they to be cast into the lake burning with fire</hi>; that the <hi>Hierarchy and Ministry of</hi> England, <hi>cause the Earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast,</hi> whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, or Pope, or Civil Powers, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, <hi>that al that be subject to the Image of the Beast</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is made <hi>the Ecclesiastical Government, shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his Indignation, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lamb, and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever,</hi> with more of the like; which are so monstrously uncharitable to be conceived of such men, and so utterly destitute of all colour of proof, that I can scarse censure it so mildly as to term it dotage, but rather take it to be the speech of a furious Bedlam. His applications also are so frivolous and wild, as that they should be abhorred rather than answered. How doth it appear that <hi>to come out of the Earth</hi> is to be <hi>raised by men of earthly spirits and principles</hi>? How doth it appear that men raising them, whether Princes or Patrons are <hi>men of such spirits and principles</hi>? When were they raised by such? <hi>To exercise the power of the Beast</hi> is not <hi>to make use of the Civil Power for its support,</hi> (which were indeed no evil, but may be good, and the wisdom of men) but to act with the same power the first Beast used in <hi>making war with the Saints.</hi> If <hi>the Ecclesiastical State as it resembles the Civil,</hi> be <hi>the Image of the Beast,</hi> and <hi>to erect it, be the character of the false Prophet</hi>; and this be so evil, then it is much more evil to erect the Civil State, which is the Prototype, which me thinks he should fear to say. How doth it appear, that <hi>the proportionableness to</hi> &amp; <hi>resemblance of the Ecclesiastical state of Government</hi> to the Civil is not therefore the better and more desirable? When did the Ministers <hi>compel all under the penalty of death,</hi> or <hi>outlawry to acknowledg subjection</hi> to the Hierarchy? Are there not many persons and places of peculiar and exempt Jurisdiction? many persons that either by indulgence or connivence, though not acknowledging such subjection, live as free as those that do? Do all <hi>great as well as small, rich and poor, free and bond receive such a mark</hi>? I am weary with refuting such palpable gross untruths, and do wonder with what face without the least proof, a man that would be accounted a Saint should attempt to obtrude them upon the world, much more that he should do it to the Church of God, and upon such absurd premisses conclude thus, <hi>It remaineth then that the present Ministers of</hi> England <hi>have the characters and properties of the false Prophets and Priests upon them, and therefore are not to be heard, but separated from.</hi>

proper to the Creatour, and herein was the Idolatry of the Gentiles, and all other, that they worshipped and served the creature, with that which was due only to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. And therefore I conceive it, not to be Idolatry, where Divine Worship is not exhibited to a creature, that is, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to some person or thing, substance or accident, real or imagined, which is not the Creatour of all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is true, that Heathen-Idolaters did many of them make the Creatour of all, the utmost bound or <hi>terminus</hi> of their Image-worship, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.23. that the <hi>Athenians</hi> did <hi>ignorantly worship the unknown God,</hi> and yet were Idolaters, because their worship was first of the Image as the next <hi>terminus</hi> or object to which it was exhibited. And the same is true of the <hi>Israelites worshipping of the calf, though they worshipped God in it, Exod.</hi> 32.5. because, though they did not <hi>worship the Calf terminatively,</hi> that is, so as to intend to direct their worship to it as the utmost bound of it, or last, or chief object: yet it was <hi>the molten Image which they worshipped, Psal.</hi> 106.19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.8. It is indeed <hi>most gross and absurd Idolatry, when the creature is worshipped termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively,</hi> and therefore the worship of <hi>Baal</hi> is accounted worse than the worship of the golden calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.31. because it was terminated lastly to the Sun, or to the Devil, who was worshipped by <hi>Molech, to whom they sacrificed their Sons and Daughters, Psal.</hi> 106.37, 38.

worship is directed to it, as Gods Deputy, to receive it for him, and so the immediate or next <hi>terminus</hi> or object is the creature, though it be intended further to or for God, as the last or utmost term, bound or object, to which it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.

Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before the Ark or Altar, was no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, it was a duty required, <hi>Psal</hi> 99.5. <hi>Worship at his footstool, meaning the Sanctuary and Ark there,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Ains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> in his <hi>Annot.</hi> Not, as the <hi>Vulgar</hi> reads it, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists would have it, <hi>Worship his footstool</hi>; no nor if the Lord be worshipped before a creature, as the <hi>Objectum à quo,</hi> as the matter or thing which is the occasion, motive or reason; of worshipping the Lord at that time, is it therefore Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, though the worship be not instituted in respect of the time.

                  </gap> so much as goe about to prove the <hi>minor</hi> denied in this sense. But in a third sense, to wit, by <hi>another way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100176:121"/>
than what God hath prescribed,</hi> he understands another way of expression of worship, in which the worship is not placed, but is used only as an outward means for conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, yet accounted alterable. In which sense the <hi>minor</hi> is not denied. But the <hi>major</hi> of his Argument is denied in either of these two later senses of the phrase, and the <hi>minor</hi> in the two former: in neither of which doth he goe about to prove it. <hi>I</hi> add,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he doth vainly suppose God hath appointed or prescribed the particularities of the modes or way of his Worship, in every of the sorts or kinds of worship he hath prescribed, as particularly in Prayer, that it must not, in a pre-conceived and stinted form of words, imposed by Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, be performed to him; but that it must by the Minister be done in a loose, undetermined, unpremeditate or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prescribed form of words by any man; The which supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is before shewed to be an errour, in the <hi>Answer to the Preface, sect.</hi> 20. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>sect.</hi> 9. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. <hi>sect.</hi> 3, 4, 5, 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this sense in which he useth the phrase, his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be retorted upon himself. Those that worship the true God in any other way, that is, form of expression, than he hath said he will be worshipped in, and is prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by him, are Idolaters: But they who pray in a loose, undetermined, unpremeditated or unprescribed form of words by man; worship the true God in another way, that is, form of expression, than he hath said he will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in, and is prescribed by him: Therefore they (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>major</hi> is his own; the <hi>minor</hi> by his own grants stands firm, till he can shew where God hath said, He will be worshipped in, and hath prescribed such a loose form of expression in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which <hi>I</hi> yet find not. What this Author hath said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is answered before. Till he brings better proof, though <hi>I</hi> will not pronounce him an Idolater; yet <hi>I</hi> shall judge him to be guilty of superstition, in counting that to be sin, which God hath not made such, and of usurpation of Gods Legislative power, in <hi>Pharisee</hi>-like requiring obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his own tradition as Gods command; together with evil censoriousness, rash judging, and uncharitable separation.

And yet, should this be granted, it would not from hence appear, that at this time there was any devised and imposed; all that is pretended to be done by</hi> Hierome, <hi>was the appointiing an order for the reading of the Scriptures, which is another thing to the imposition of Forms of Prayer in worship.

(viz. Gregories <hi>Liturgy, as it is thought) to which he compels his Ministers, by threats and punishments, the usual attendencies and support of Liturgies ever since their production in the world.

               <p n="2">2ly. <hi>It is evident, that for the first four hundred years and more after Christ, there was no Liturgy framed, nor any by solemn Authority imposed, to the year eight hundred; it follows undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably from hence, That to worship God in the way of a Liturgy, or stinted forms of Prayer, is to worship him in a way that is not of his appointment.</hi>

It is to be remembred, that, as I said before, were his Conclusion granted, yet Ministers would not be proved to be Idolaters; all worshipping of God, in a way that is not of his appointment, being not Idolatry, except therein Divine or Religious Worship be exhibited to a Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That his own Argument, whose way of Worship is not prescribed without a stinted Form of Prayer, would as well prove himself an Idolater, as the Ministers of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. That he still acknowledgeth, that the worship accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> is the worship of the true God, nor doth he shew, that, according to it, any other is worshipped.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That he doth not except against the matter of the Prayers in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> no nor the particular forms of expression, as if they were not agreeable to the Scriptures, or indecent, or inept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all Liturgies, or stinted forms of Prayer (and consequently this) are not of Gods appointment, but of humane invention.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they are unduly imposed on Ministers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Ministers do sinfully, yea Idolatrously use them, because it is a way of Worship not appointed by God.</p>
               <p>The two former of these reach not the Ministers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but the Composers and Imposers; it is the third thing which is pertinent to the present Crimination, which may occasion to enquire,</p>

may not be lawfully used by a Minister of the Gospel in his publick ministration?</p>

The words of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> may be understood of the intention of the affections, or duration of prayers, which may be in stinted forms; nor is it unlikely, but that thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings were some of them such, as in their <hi>Psalms</hi> which they sung, which <hi>Pliny</hi> mentions in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Trajan</hi> in that age; and those it is likely were stinted forms: And they might <hi>pray without a monitor or prompter,</hi> which excludes the suggestion of others, and <hi>from the heart,</hi> includes of their own accord, and yet pray in stinted expressions: Yea, the things mentioned that they prayed for, seem to intimate Set forms, agreeable to the things he mentions as prayed for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. However, it is apparent, if not from <hi>Tertullians Book of Prayer,</hi> yet out of <hi>Cyprians Book concerning the Lords Prayer,</hi> that Christians did, and conceived they ought, in publique prayer, to use the prescript words of the Lords Prayer, and that they had some other forms then, whieh are still retained, which those words intimate, <hi>Therefore also the Priest, a Preface being premised before Prayer, prepares the minds of the Brethren, by saying,</hi> Lift up your hearts: <hi>that when the people answer,</hi> We lift them up to the Lord, <hi>they may be minded, that they ought to think on nothing else but the Lord.</hi> Which, if it prove not an entire Liturgy to have been then in use, yet a worship of God by a stinted form of Words, was sure thought on in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time; and that this Author writes too confidently, when he saith, <hi>The least footsteps of such a way of worship are not found, nor were thought of in those times.</hi> It follows.</p>

horrid advance against the wisdome, faithfulness, love and care of Christ towards the Beloved of his Soul, be gainsaid. That he not only expects, but solemnly charges upon these Officers, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the gifts bestowed upon them, for the edification of his Body, is evidently compriz'd, and very frequently remarked in the Scripture,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.6. 1 Cor. 12.7. Ephes. 4.11. Prov. 17.16. Luke 19.20. <hi>To imagine after all this, that any Worship should be of the institution of Christ, that should shut out of doors, as unnecessary, the exercise of the gifts given by him, to be made use of in the solemn discharge of the worship of his house, is such an imputation of folly to him, as may not be charged upon any person of an ordinary capacity or understanding: Yet this is righteously to be imputed to him</hi> (absit blasphemia) <hi>if the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book <hi>worship be a Worship of his appointment: The exercise of the gift of Prayer (to mention no more) being wholly excluded hereby.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The whole Worship of God, may, according to these mens prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, be discharged without any Sermon at all; and it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest it is frequently so, at one time or other, in most of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of</hi> England.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>We had alwayes thought, that Christ having given gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, did require the use of those gifts at all times, when ever persons were called to the performance of that service for which they were designedly given by him, by vertue of the fore-mentioned precepts. When Christ hath given a gift of Prayer unto his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and charged them to stirr up the gift given them, and not to napkin their Talent, we had verily thought, that when ever they had been called forth to the performance of that duty, he did really intend and expect, that they should be found in the exercise of the gift given; and see as yet no reason to change our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in this matter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>major</hi> Proposition is not in all cases true. The resting on the Sabbath day was a positive duty charged by God, yet the sacrificing, which was an obstruction of that duty, called by our Lord Christ, <hi>Prophaning the Sabbath, Matth.</hi> 12.5. was Worship of Gods appointment. Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ, and preaching the Gospel, were Worship of Christs appointment, and yet they were obstructions to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100176:125"/>
duties required to be done to Parents, Wives, and Children Therefore it is not true, unless the thing, which is an obstruction, be such of its own nature, of it self, and not by accident, and so necessarily and universally such an obstruction. But not to insist on this, the <hi>minor</hi> Proposition is many wayes faulty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is supposed, that the <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi> worship is a different sort of Worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from such as is used by those, which exercise the gift of prayer, as he terms it; which is absurd: For then so many several forms of words as are used, should be so many several sorts of Worship; all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, that are not immediately inspired, should be Will-worship; and so preachers several methods, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in preaching, should be several sorts of Worship. This is that which I assert, That the same petitions, the same Confessions, and Thanksgivings, for matter, are the same prayer, and Worship, though in various expressions; and that the same prayers, read out of the <hi>Common-prayer Book,</hi> and the prayers of the preachers, framed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and uttered, if they ask the same things in other phrases, are the same prayers, and Worship: And they that can joyn with the one, and say <hi>Amen</hi> to them; may as lawfully, and safely, without sin, joyn with, and say <hi>Amen</hi> to the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Authors phrase doth intimate, that ability to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, compose, and utter in variety of expressions, petitions to God, is the gift of prayer; and the exercise of it, is the exercise of that gift; which is false: sith the gift of prayer is by the moving of the affections, directing the mind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing faith, as the Text alledged by this Author, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. proves, the Spirits work being there to acquaint us, what we are to pray for; and to <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in the inspiration of words, or method, or fitting a person with various, or unpremeditated expressions. Yea, those who express not, who do not compose their petitions in any order or method, as in Ejaculatory prayers, such as <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> prayer was, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Hannahs,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Hezekiahs, Isai.</hi> 38.14 Those who premeditate before they pray, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.14. have as truly, and perhaps more rightly, and do exercise the gift of prayer, as
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100176:126"/>
those who in never so extemporary manner, enlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in various expressions and petitions. It is true, the Author of the <hi>Discourse concerning the interest of words in Prayer,</hi> ch. 2. tells us, <hi>The gift and grace of Prayer are two things: This, he derives from the spirit of adoption; That, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines to be an ability of mind, to form words expressive of such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of our hearts, as are according to the will of God, conjoyned with a faculty of memo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y, and of expression, and elocution; which,</hi> he saith, <hi>is partly natural, partly by industry attainable.</hi> But the gift of Prayer here, by our Authors words, <hi>pag.</hi> 62. is the <hi>donation of the Spirit</hi>; and usually the exercise of it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions unpremeditated, or conceived in opposition to praying by a book, or written set forms kept in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is termed <hi>praying in the Spirit,</hi> and so no natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ability; which is to be observed, that the ambiguity of expressions may not deceive the unwary Reader. Now if this be observed they that pray in a set form, and those that read the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> may be truly said to pray in the Spirit, if their heart goe with their words; and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise the gift of Prayer, if the gift of Prayer be as the <hi>Discourse</hi> cited doth describe it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The gift of Prayer, by alleging <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should seem, by this Author, to be accounted a ministerial gift, proper to them; for so were the gifts mentioned <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11. which if so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it is not common to the Saints, nor the exercise of it a <hi>positive duty cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If they have it, by this Authors arguing, they are to exercise it, as well as Ministers; and it is as unlawful for them to pray by a book, as for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; they so praying, worship in a way not appointed by God, and are Idolaters, as well as the Ministers; and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is to be from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as from Ministers. Whereas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100176:126"/>
lawfully used, or any others treatises, or forms of Prayer, for the obtaining of it. And if so, the <hi>Common. Prayer Book</hi> worship may be, so far from being an obstruction to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive duty of exercising the gift of Prayer, that it may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it, by acquainting us with many things we should ask for: as the Homilies also may be helps for the knowledge of what Doctrine Preachers are to teach their people. And then this Authors Argument may be thus retorted. That Form may be lawfully used for Worship, which may be a means to further any positive duty, charged by Christ to be performed by the Saints. But such may be the forms of Prayers in the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The <hi>major</hi> is grounded on the rule given by Divines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Decalogue: That which requires a duty, requires the means conducing thereto. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved, in that the <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi> directs what things are to be prayed for, by reason of the brevity of Collects; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponds, the frequent use, the plain expressions, help the memory and elocution, wherein the acquired gift of Prayer consists; therefore it is not an obstruction, but a help to the gift of Prayer. But this Author, though he may perhaps count this tolerable in others, yet not in Ministers; let's view what he saith of them. He alledgeth <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. and would inferr from thence, That <hi>all Ministers have the gift of Prayer, and are to use it; that the</hi> Common-Prayer Book <hi>worship shuts it out of doors, as unnecessary, and therefore is not of Christs appointment.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Text expresseth not the several sorts of Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the several sorts of Officers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be supposed, that ministerial gifts are also imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet whether extraordinary, or ordinary, may be doubted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If ordinary gifts, there may be a question, Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>her the gift of Prayer, as he means it, were one: that is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ hath required<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that every Minister should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, on all occasions, to express himself without any stint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed form, either conceived by himself, or composed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to make known the requests, which it concerns his people, to whom he is Pastour, in the most solemn and publick auditory, to ask of God, in their behalf, in words and elocution fitting the matter and auditory. I doubt not but the Minister should be able to express the requests of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100176:127"/>
the people, as he should be able to declare the mind of God to the people; yet neither the one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the other, is of necessity to be done, or the Minister tied to do it every way, but the best way he is able, or at least, that way as is fit for the end of his expressions, to wit, the peoples understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not the ostentation of his parts. The Apostles could preach without study, but <hi>Timothy was to give attendance to reading, to meditate, to give himself wholly to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ministers are to preach the Word now, but they are not tyed to preach without notes, without study, without other helps which God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords: Nor are Ministers bound to express themselves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes without pre-conceived, or prescribed forms in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and yet they may faithfully discharge their work. Now God doth not give gifts, as he did in the Apostles times; and therefore the same readiness and exuberancy of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or composure of petitions, is not to be expected of Ministers now, as was of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4· I add, That though the Apostles said, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.4. <hi>We will give our selves continually to Prayer, and to the ministry of the Word.</hi> And St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Nor do we find, that either Christ, or his Apostles, used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forms of prayer, before or after their preaching; and therefore conceive not this to be the proper work of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, or that either way of praying is determined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore both may lawfully be used by the Minister, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christians. Nor doth the one way of Worship shut out of doors the other; or the Minister, by using the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer Book,</hi> exclude conceived prayer by the speakers. If they were tyed, by the Governours, to use no other than the <hi>Common-prayer Book</hi> expressions; yet this is not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, either to the <hi>Common-prayer Book,</hi> or its way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or to the Ministers, but unto those who do so rigidly impose it.

There are many in the Congregation perhaps yea some Women that can form and utter words as fit for Prayer as the Minister; will not this Author have this gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er shut out of doors, and yet not conclude that a positive duty is obstructed thereby? Besides, there may be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of a duty, as unseasonable, sith affirmative precepts bind not <hi>ad semper,</hi> to be done at all times, perhaps time will not permit, or weather, or some accidents, or more necessary business; and yet the gift not shut out of doors, as unnecessary, but as only inconvenient at that time.

                  <hi>Answ</hi> This Author runs on in his gross mistakes, as if the form of words in the <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi> were the Worship, that it were a several sort of Worship from the prayers made by a Preacher of his own conception, and that such prayers were worship of Christs institution, and not the other. Which mistakes are shewed before: And what he saith here, is answered, either in this <hi>chapter, sect.</hi> 4. or <hi>chapt.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 3.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100176:128"/>
The <hi>Common-Prayer Book</hi> worship is no more a pure humane invention, than Preachers conceived-prayers: Nor is it <hi>any Idol,</hi> forbidden <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4, 5. Nor <hi>any Prophecy added to the Book of the Revelation,</hi> forbidden <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.18. Nor such <hi>an Ephod as</hi> Gideon <hi>made,</hi> Judg. 8.24. Nor such <hi>a not seeking God after the due order,</hi> as was <hi>the carrying of the Ark in a cart, and</hi> Uzzah<hi>'s putting his hand to it,</hi> 1 Chron. 15.13. Nor such an invention forbidden, as was <hi>the Altar of</hi> Damascus, <hi>imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by</hi> Uriah, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16 11. And therefore it is sufficient to deny what is here said, without forming of an Argument. As for <hi>Josh</hi> 22 10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it makes for the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> not against it: sith that Altar was allowed of, though it were for religious signification, and yet not by Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; and therefore proves, that all inventions of men, whereby our Worship of God is signified, are not unlawful, if they be not made necessary, nor the Worship of God pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the things so invented, or their use.

               <p>Answ. <hi>It is not true, that the Objection supposeth, That some things in the instituted Worship of Christ, are but meer circumstances thereof, as such: meaning, that any particularity of that action, which Christ hath prescribed for his Worship, being instituted by him, is a meer arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary circumstance, and not a necessary part of that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. It is held in the Lords Supper, and all institutions of Christ, in which particularities are expressed, there should be strict observation of them, as part of the Worship: But in things not determined, liberty is allowed to vary; and therefore, if Christ have not instituted, that you shall pray without a Book, or set Form, Prayer by it may be lawfully done.

               <p n="2">2. Saith this Author, <hi>That tis lawful for Saints to pray in a Form</hi> (i. e. <hi>to tye themselves to a written stinted form of words in Prayer) is not yet proved, nor like to be; tis too large a field for us to enter into: nor is it needful to do so, till it be proved, That to pray in the form of the</hi> Common-Prayer Book, <hi>or imposed devised Liturgies, is so: Yet</hi> in transitu, <hi>we crave leave humbly to offer, That to pray in a Form, as before explained, is altogether unlawful, being,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A quenching of the Spirit of Prayer.</hi>

               <p n="4">4ly. <hi>If it be lawful for Saints to pray in a Form, tis lawful, either because they have not the Spirit; or that having the Spirit, he is not a sufficient help to them in their approaches to God: If the first, they are not Saints,</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>To assert the second, is little less than blasphemy, besides its direct opposition to</hi> Rom. 8.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The position of this Author here, by his words, appears to be, That not only it is altogether unlawful for Ministers, but also for all Saints, all that have the Spirit of God, to pray in a Form: And though he seems to mean by his addition, that he counts it only then unlawful, when <hi>they tye themselves,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ministers, but also from every Saint, that not only often, but once useth a set Form, devised by himself, in Family exercises, as before meals, or other times: And, if he be of Mr. <hi>Ainsworths</hi> mind, in the controversie between him and Mr. <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which I think will be done by this Argument: That Prayer may be lawful to Saints, in which neither is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing done forbidden by God, nor any thing omitted which God requires thereto, but such may be praying in a Form: Therefore. To what this Author humbly offers, I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the things he offers, proceed only upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes: That the <hi>praying the Spirit,</hi> Ephes. 6.18. Jude 20. <hi>in the Holy Ghost,</hi> is meant of extemporal, unpremedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, unprescribed forms of words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereas, <hi>praying in the Spirit,</hi> is meant of praying by the operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within, not of Prayer in respect of the form of words wherein it is expressed; which may be gathered concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former Text, in that the Prayers there, which are to be <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> are all, <hi>alwayes with all prayer and suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication</hi>: which cannot be well expounded of other Prayers, than such as are solitary, of which many are only ejaculatory, without words: And this is confirmed by the words, <hi>Ephes</hi> 5 19. where the effect of being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> is the <hi>speaking to themselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord in their heart.</hi> Besides, as all the directions, <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.</hi> 6.13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100176:132"/>
are precepts of what each Christian should do by and for himself: so is <hi>v.</hi> 18. and so, if not solely, yet chiefly meant of solitary Prayers, to which words are not necessary; and therefore, <hi>praying in the Spirit,</hi> is by the operation of the Spirit in the heart, not by the Spirits immediate forming of words in the tongue. And the same is to be said of <hi>Jude</hi> 20. <hi>Of</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. I have spoken before, in answer to <hi>ch.</hi> 5. <hi>sect.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ability to express petitions in words extempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, unpremeditated, is termed, the Spirit of Prayer, as if it were in every one that hath the sanctifying Spirit of God, and they only; for so the alleging <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.26. for it, in the 4<hi>th.</hi> Argument, must inferr. But who knows not by experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that many that have not the Spirit of God, have yet this ability to admiration, as is related by <hi>Camden, Saravia,</hi> the Author of the relation of the conspiracy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Hacket,</hi> in Q <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and many others: And on the other side, many whose holiness of life shewed they had the Spirit, yet not this ability; and therefore it is ill called, the Spirit of Prayer, whereby many unwary souls are ensnared with the opinion, as if such as can express themselves fluently in words, largely, and with shew of affection, were immediately moved by the Spirit; and they distill thereby into many inconsiderate persons, errours and evil principles: Whereas it is acknowledged to be but an acquired ability, with help of natural endowments, and many times is proved to be but a counterfeit and deceitful practice. Now then, in answer to each of the particulars, I say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Spirit is not quenched, as is forbidden, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.19. by a set Form of Prayer, used by another, and read out of a Book, any otherwise, than by a pronouncing without a Book, a conceived Form; the ability of another to conceive and utter, for matter and words, is as much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the one, as by the other. It is true, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice is against reading, or the Forms read, or the Reader huddles it over, or delivers it coldly, it much abates the affection of the hearer: and so it is in saying over a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayer, if there be a prejudice against the person, or his delivery be dull and heavy. And it is not to be denied, that lively affectionate expressions, with readiness of speech, and apt emphatical words, have much energy on hearers;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100176:133"/>
and so sometimes it is, when a written Sermon or Prayer is well and pathetically pronounced: So that the Form doth but lessen the affection by accident, not necessarily, and of it self; and thus either when a stinted Form is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by another, or by the person praying, it may be very incommodious to use it, usually such Forms being read or said without heed or feeling. Yet universally it is not so: Nor is the <hi>quenching of the Spirit</hi> (meant 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.19.) meant of <hi>the Spirit of Prayer,</hi> more than any other exercise of godliness or gifts, whether ordinary or extraordinary: Nor is <hi>the quenching the Spirit,</hi> the act of another, but of him in whom the Spirit is quenched; who, either by his sinful life, or by <hi>cares, and riches, and pleasures of this life, and lusts of other things, ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>kes the word of God</hi> (which is <hi>the sword of the Spirit,</hi> Ephes. 6.17.) as our Saviour speaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 8 14. and they <hi>bring no fruit to perfection</hi> (unto which sense the following Exhortations, of <hi>not despising prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and proving all things,</hi> v. 20, 21. do incline me) and so the sense is, Quench not the operation of the Spirit, by the preaching of the Word, whether by embracing errours, or by evil lusts: Or if, by <hi>the Spirit,</hi> be meant, the comforts or extraordinary gifts of it: In any of these wayes, <hi>the quenching</hi> is by the persons own act, in whom <hi>the Spirit is quenched:</hi> It is neither, by any Interpreter I meet with, or any shew of reason, applyed to the extinguishing or slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ability of another, to utter and conceive Prayers, by publique use of a Liturgy, which doth not any otherwise quench that ability, than any other way of expression doth the ability of the hearer, which must be stinted; and so, <hi>the Spirit of Prayer,</hi> as this Author terms it, <hi>be quenched</hi> by the speaker in all joynt-prayer, unless it be allowed all to speak together, contrary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.27. Whence I conclude, that this Text is most impertinent: And though it be, that some mens reading, and in like sort, some mens speaking without book, some using of a set Form in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and in private, may by accident, through the fault of the speaker, hearer, or user, abate the fervency of spirit in solitary or joynt prayers; yet it is not so necessarily, or of it self, and therefore not unlawful, nor <hi>quenching the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prayer,</hi> nor <hi>a rendring useless the donation of the Spirit, as a Spirit of Prayer, unto the children of God,</hi> as this Author speaks in his 2<hi>d.</hi> Offer: But in some cases a stinted Form is
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100176:133"/>
helpful, both to the understanding, memory, affections, utterance in prayer, both publique and private, as many holy Saints have found by experience.</p>
               <p>To the 3<hi>d.</hi> I say, That the precept to <hi>Timothy, of stirring up the gift of God, which was in him, by the putting on of</hi> Pauls <hi>hands,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.6. cannot be understood, of the ability to express himself in extemporary prayer; but of his ability to preach the Gospel, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. is meant; which he is encouraged to by the next words, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>For, God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a sound mind</hi>; or, as some read, <hi>of castigation, or reducing others to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>briety.</hi> However, it is impertinent to the purpose of the Author here, it being not meant of exciting the gift of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in prayer with others; and yet, if it were, he that reads a Liturgy, may stirr up the gift of expression at another time, if he cannot when he reads. As for the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ving of the talents, Matth.</hi> 25.15.27. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.13.23. it is the duty of every Christian, and not only of Ministers; and if it be meant, of using abilities in joynt-prayer, every Christian must, as he is able, utter himself in prayer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26, 27. I conceive, by comparing <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.29, 30. with <hi>Matth,</hi> 13.11, 12. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24, 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>the talent which is given to each,</hi> is the knowledge, or teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of God, or <hi>the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> which each person is to improve, by <hi>bringing forth the fruits of it, Matth</hi> 21.43. Or if it be meant of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters gift, it is to be understood of his ability to preach the Gospel, and the improving it, by converting others to faith and obedience; not of so mean a thing, as an ability of conceiving and uttering Forms of prayer without book.</p>
               <p>As for the 4<hi>th.</hi> thing offered, The lawfulness of the Saints praying in a Form, is neither because <hi>they have not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>; nor, <hi>that having the Spirit, he is not a sufficient help to them in their approaches to God</hi>: but because in such praying, neither is any thing done forbidden by God, nor any thing omitted thereby, which God requires for the performing the duty of prayer. <hi>The Spirit,</hi> I grant, <hi>is sufficient to help in our approaches to God,</hi> and <hi>doth help, Rom</hi> 8.15.26 But that it is done by enabling, by immediate inspiration, to utter matter of prayer, for the benefit of others, is not meant in those places. And indeed, such a mistake hath filled some with high conceit of themselves, and others with

But whatever be the judgement or practice of the present Ministers, yet the words of the <hi>Preface</hi> (which are more to be regarded, than any particular Ministers opinion, whereof some, its confess'd, have too much magnified it) do shew, that the imposition makes it not such as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor chargeth on them. And this is enough to acquit the use of it from Idolatry, even in this Authors own sense, sith they do not place the worship of God in the Form, but in the Kind of worship commanded by God; and so the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> of his Argument is denied.

The</hi> major <hi>(or first Proposition) carrying a brightness along with it, sufficient to lead any one into the belief of the truth thereof, one would think may be taken for granted.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That such as act in the holy things of God, by vertue of an Office-power received from Idolaters, are themselves such at least in respect of that their Office-power so received by them) That</hi> Jeroboams <hi>Priests were all of them Idolaters, we suppose will not be denied: Supposing some or more to act in the Worship of God, by vertue of an Office-power received from them, were these to be accounted in that respect Idolaters? It seemeth so: Nor can there be the least pretence of reason to the contrary: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly such as act by vertue of authority committed to them, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Civil, from Rebels, are equally guilty of Rebellion, as those from whom they derive that their authority. The case is here the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That such as offer up to God a Worship meerly of humane composition, once abused to Idolatry, with the modes and rites of Idolaters, are Idolaters: If these be not such, I must profess, I know not who are. That there are few, or none, that worship the Creature</hi> terminative, <hi>will not be denied, the most of Idolaters in the world are such, upon the account of their worshipping the true God through mediums of their own d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>vising, with rites and modes that never entred into the heart of God to prescribe. To as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, that any should symbolize with Idolaters herein (who are solely upon this foot of account such) and not be guilty of the sin of Idolatry, is absurd and irrational. The</hi> major <hi>Proposition then (as was said) may be taken for granted.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Not so, without better proof, and thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, That they still abuse it to Idolatry; and, That the modes and rites be of themselves Idolatrous: without these limitations, the <hi>major</hi> is denied.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Objection, though it be but a slight thing, and of no real force, to nullifie or invalidate the Calling of the present Ministers; yet, because the well-affected Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants are zealous against Popery, as having learned the Pope to be Antichrist, and that terrible threanings are, in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> against any communion with any thing that is suggested to them by those, to whom they adhere, to come from <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Pope, as being Antichristian, it is needful, that this thing should be cleared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for rectifying the mistakes of people, that their unadvised zeal against some things as Popish, which are not, may not occasion

unnecessary Schism, and such other evils, into which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, perhaps otherwise of honest hearts, cast themselves to their ruine. It is known to those that study Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies between Protestants and Papists, that this hath been one grand Objection of the Papists against the Reformed Churches, that their Ministers are not rightly Ordained, and therefore they have no succession; which by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in his Book <hi>de Notis Ecclesiae, c.</hi> 8. is made a Note of the Church; and therefore they are not a true Church, but schismatical. The Answers given to this Objection, are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the truth of the Reformed Churches, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in them of true Doctrine, is sufficient to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate them true Churches, as I have asserted in my <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manism discussed,</hi> against the <hi>Manuel</hi> of <hi>H. T. Art.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Ministers may be sent of God, who teach the Doctrine of God, though they have not Ordination accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church-Canons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as was the case at the first beginning of the Reformation; in which there was something extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, by reason of the long tyranny of Popes, and the great corruptions in the Latine Churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That their Ministers were at first ordained by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Bishops; and though they did after renounce the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Sacrifice for quick and dead, yet even by the Papists own Canons, and resolutions of their Casuists, their power to administer the Word and Sacraments, according to the Word of God, continued still.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That those who had been thus ordained, had power to ordain others, for which the <hi>French,</hi> and other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants of the Presbyterial Government, allege, That Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters may Ordain, even by the confession of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi>; and that Bishops, though they be hereticks in their account, yet they lose not the power of Ordaining, no, not when degraded; of which more may be seen in <hi>Rivet. sum.

And to stop the evasion, that it was so, when God appointed it, though this would not avoid the instance, the bread and wine being of Gods appointment, and the use of them in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, as well as the Altar, Ark, Temple, were, they were instituted to be memorative signs of Christs body and blood, communicated to the receivers by faith; yet I find that adoration or worshipping of God before the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>respectivè</hi>

Another instance is 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.3 <hi>When all the children of</hi> Israel <hi>saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and worshipped and praised the Lord, saying, For he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Here was adoration and worshipping God, in, by, or before a creature, not having special institution, abiding in their sight, as the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum significativè à quo,</hi> or the motive of their adoration, and worship of the Lord, and yet no Idolatry. I confess, that when the worship is before it, so as it is directed to it, as upon the sight of the bread, or a crucifix, the host, or a crucifix is worshipped, whether terminatively, or as the representative of another, it is Idolatry: As If <hi>Job, when he had seen the Sun when it shined, or the Moon walking in brightness, his heart had been secretly enticed, and his mouth had kissed his hand,</hi> as it is <hi>Job</hi> 31.26, 27. it had been Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: For then the Sun had been not only <hi>obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Till Divine worship be given to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is not Idolatry; although in the kind or means of worship, there may be Will-worship; and in the opinion of those, that count their act, or the object to be holy, when it is not, there may be superstition of the mind; and in the use of such things, or forbearing their use, superstition in the members.</p>
               <p>That which this Author saith of his <hi>major Proposition, as generally owned by Protestants,</hi> I do not believe it to be true, understanding it as he doth, <hi>of relation only to the creature, as objectum significativè à quo, or the motive of the adoration,</hi> and not the object to which it is directed.

As for his Reason, if <hi>the elements were not there, they would not kneel; therefore they are the</hi> objectum significativè à quo, <hi>or the motive of their kneeling</hi>; partly the Antecedent is not true, for they kneel before they receive the elements brought to them, and after they have eaten and drunk, while they are in the meditation of Christs death, and the benefits by it, using holy ejaculation in prayer and thanksgiving to God; partly the consequence may be denied: For, though they would not kneel, were not the elements there, yet this is not sufficient to prove their presence the motive of kneeling, any more, than the presence and speech of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

when they are received, that is, while they are in the Ministers hand, or their own, or in their mouths, which is the <hi>objectum significativè à quo</hi>; but the actions with the elements, at the consecration by the Minister, which signifie Christs death: and the use by themselves in eating and drinking, whereby are signified their nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Christ unto life eternal, which are the motive to that gratitude and trust in Christ, which in kneeling they exercise by prayer. As for the words of <hi>Didoclavius,</hi> with <hi>Maccovius</hi> his assent, they are the words of an Adversary to the Ministers in this cause, and therefore not fit to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged as a proof in this matter: Nor, if they were true, would they prove kneeling to be Idolatry, but to be some way against the second Commandement for avoiding Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.

Which abuse of words, as it smels of arrogance, in appropriating to themselves the title, which is common to all true believers, and uncharitableness in conceiving of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as no visible Saints, because they are not entered into
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100176:147"/>
that, which is termed Church covenant; so is it injurious to others, though godly, from whom such are estranged as no visible Saints, but they are censured and declined as persons without, that have nothing in them of God, yea as adversaries to the power of Godliness, meer formalists, if they speak for the common-prayer book, or any thing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably of any of the Bishops; and this serves for a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of keeping them to themselves without joyning in prayer and hearing in publique, which they call <hi>hearing with the world out of the Church.</hi> This I conceive to be the reason of this Authors expressions here of the <hi>saints visibly so scandalizing their bretheren by their hearing the Ministers that now preach publickly.</hi> By which it may be seen, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not much who do hear the present ministers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> so that they do not; as if it were not necessary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre all others from hearing them, if they be false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Idolaters, as this Author accuseth them, yea and to oppose them even unto the death, if they be such: so that this argument is unnecessary, if the other be good, and rather supposeth all that is formerly disputed to be weak; yet this point of scandal may serve turn to affright them from communion with the publique Ministery and keep them to themselves, though it prove never so injurious to their peace and outward estate, and sinful by reason of the Schism that is continued by it. For this reason I shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin this Argument also as it is here delivered, and so much the rather because I have found by experience, that when in this and other doubts of conscience I have in conference with honest but scrupulous christians satisfied them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the lawfulness of that which they doubted of, yet in this I could hardly quiet their consciences, that they might do without sin what they scrupled to do, because they should offend good people, the scandalizing of whom our Saviour and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> make a hainous sin, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing an heavy curse. For which reason I printed the treatise of scandalizing forementioned, more then twenty years ago; in the epistle dedicatory whereof are these words In my small reading and experience I finde few doubts of conscience, concerning mens patent actions, in the resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of which the difficulty hath not most of all rested on this point of Scandal. At present, I shall not open the word <hi>scandal,</hi> nor insist on the definition of Scandal, nor the sorts
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100176:148"/>
of scandalizing or causes of it, or the various cases concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, leaving the Reader to that Treatise, or to what else hath been since written by D. <hi>Henry Hammond of scandal,</hi> Ma. <hi>Henry Jeanes, of abstinence from appearance of evil,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for a fuller understanding of this point, but assert that notwithstanding what is here said of the offence of brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the sad consequence of blood guiltiness, which this Author would have it conceived the hearing the present Ministers tends to: yet neither the so termed visible Saints, nor any other by hearing the present Ministers, do sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the precepts of non-scandalizing, given by Christ or his Aposte St. <hi>Paul. Matth.</hi> 18.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.1. 2 <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13.15.20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8.9.13. and 10 24. Which I prove thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That is not scandalizing forbidden in these texts which is neither by giving evil example in doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that which is intrinsecally or of it self evil, though none were offended, nor by enticing practices, or persecution impelling to evil; nor by abuse of liberty in things lawful to the harm of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; which are all the wayes I know of scandalizing there forbidden, if there be any other shewed I think how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it will not reach to the present case: that which this Author seems to reduce it to is the last, in that he puts in a <hi>Parenthesis</hi> in the <hi>minor</hi> these words <hi>(there is no positive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Scriptures for it.)</hi> But it is not to be reduced to that sort of scandalizing, for the hearing of the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>England</hi> cannot be accounted a matter of liberty, or indifferency, but either duty or sin, hearing the word of God being an express precept in the general, and so is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying them that are Rulers: now the ministers preaeh the word of God, and our Rulers command us to hear them, and this they have power to do, and in this they have power over their subjects as parents have over their children, and masters over their servants, and are to be obeyed in that which is not evil, but good, and therefore the scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing is not by abuse of liberty in things indifferent; nor is it scandalizing in doing a thing in it self evil or impelling to it, as hath been shewed in the foregoing chapters of this answer. Therefore the offending Bretheren what ever it be by hearing the present ministers is not the scandalizing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>

                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:100176:148"/>2.

                  </gap>ing whereof, those precepts of not scandalizing were given. This is proved, because it tends not to any sin, but to the performance of duty in hearing Gods word: nor to any such sorrow or vexation, as the precepts would have prevented; which were such, as made either persons to be discouraged in Christianity, or to walk uncomfortably in the profession of it, as by view of the Texts may appear. But to neither of these effects doth the hearing of the present Minister tend. This Author saith, It <hi>makes visible Saints to grieve, as their grones and tears alone and together demonstrate.</hi> But, how doth the Hearing the present Ministers tend to it? Sure, neither in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the action, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this case, the persons grieved, if it be, because they are displeased with what is done, out of a contrary judgement, they grieve themselves; if they mourn for it, as the hearers sin, because it is a recession from their party, it is not out of zeal that they groan, but out of frowardness, out of passion, not out of compassion, out of an erroneous principle, to which they adhere, not out of weakness of Faith. This Author saith, <hi>Many poor souls have been drawn, by reason of the practice of some leading Brethren in this matter, against the checks of their own conscience, to a conformity herein, to their after grief and wounding, and so those leaders guilty of spilling the blood of Souls.</hi> Surely this were a direful Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalizing, if this conformity were a Return to <hi>Babylon,</hi> as they would make it: But being no such matter, this is but a scarbug: If there be such checks of conscience, after grief and wounding, it is to be imputed to such as this Author, who represents it to such a poor soul, as a horrid sin; not to him, that by doing what he may and ought, leads o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do the like. But the truth is, those offended Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, for the most part, are vexed and enraged, (as their
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100176:149"/>
reviling speeches, and hard censures shew) rather for the crossing them in their way, than affected with godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for it, as a sin, <hi>counting him as an Enemy,</hi> scarce ever <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing as a Brother,</hi> contrary to 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.15. Which is so much the worse in them, in that, by representing the hearing of publick Teachers as dangerous and odious, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fall to the opinions of <hi>Quakers, Seekers,</hi> and other erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous opinions and practises, which by hearing the present Ministers, might have been prevented; which whether they groan and weep for, their own consciences can tell them: so farr as I discern, the principles of the <hi>Separatists,</hi> and their practice, have occasioned them; and for that I think they ought to mourn.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That is not Scandalizing forbidden in those Texts, which doth not arise from any defect of charity, or undue behaviour of the person offending; but from the distemper of the person offended. But the offence by the hearers of the present Ministers, doth not arise from any defect of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or undue behaviour of the person offending; but from the distemper of the person offended. Therefore it is not the Scandalizing forbidden in those Texts, which do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the offending to defect of charity, or pride, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or the like undue behaviour, towards the offended, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 10.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8 1.11, 12.

But so it is in the offence for the hearing the present Ministers, if it were regarded, so as to abstain from hearing to satisfy this Author, and such as are like minded, the persons supposed to offend them must never hear them, nor any of them though preaching never so profitably, and so must not only lose the present benefit, but also be deprived perpetually, and judge that which is their liberty to be unlawful, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. That is not the scandalizing forbidden in those texts, the avoiding of which drawes after it a greater scandal and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100176:150"/>
of worse consequence; and that which is not imaginary only, but real Scandal. This I conceive none should deny: For if every Scandal should be avoided, then the chiefest, in which case the lesser, and only imaginary, cannot be said to be forbidden. But in shunning to hear the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, there is a real, manifold worse Scandal, than is by hearing of them. Which I demonstrate thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The person that might hear a profitable Preacher, by shunning hearing of him, upon the conceit of unlawfulness to hear him, doth scandalize himself, contrary to <hi>Matth</hi> 5.29, 30. and 18.8, 9. in that he confirms himself in his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious errour, and hinders his spiritual good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in Christianity, and ensnares himself in an unjustifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble separation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth also truly scandalize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others by his example; confirming those that refuse to hear, in their errour and schism, whom he ought to oppose, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did St. <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2.11. when their shunning to hold communion with some, as unclean, tends to the establishing of an errour and schism, as his did.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this refusing to hear the present Ministers, through such suggestions as this Author instills into the minds of men against them, people are driven from the publique Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and thereby the sheep of Christ are scattered; some betake themselves to the meetings of <hi>Quakers,</hi> where they are mis-led by the delusions of Satan, under pretence of following the light within them, other joyn with the <hi>Fifth monarchy men,</hi> who pervert them with peruicious te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents and designes against Magistrates; and in the best of the <hi>Separatists,</hi> there is so much bitterness and enmity, against dissenters from them, instilled into their minds, as quite breaks the bond of charity, that should unite all Christs Discipl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

lawful; to wit, with all, either when we may win them to the embracing of the truth, or the abating the opposition of adversaries, or procuring our own peace.

               <p>Nor is what this Author saith <hi>of the nature of Scandal gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, evident beyond exception, from the Apostles discourse,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10.

               <p n="1">1.

Or that it was the weakness of the offended person, that <hi>he was not fully perswaded of that liberty,</hi> it had been his weakness and sin, if he had judged it his liberty to sit at meat in the Idols Temple. But it was the sin of him that had knowledge, that he sate at meat in the Idols

moment to make the offence, Scandal given, and not only taken. For if offence be taken, where there is no proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reason, why the scandalized should judge it evil, it is his fault who thus judgeth, not his who acts, that, which he sees no reason why any should conceive any evil in it. The Apostle therefore did not require to forbear the eating of the Idolothyte, but when the weak Brother said <hi>This is offered in sacrifice to Idols,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10 28. which shewed the reason, why he should be offended, if he did eat it; and that reason might probably induce him to conceive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, which thing is a requisite condition to Scandal gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, sith, if upon any surmise of a weak Brother, I must forbear my liberty, though there is no shew of reason, or no probability why he should conceive it evil to use it, my liberty would be as no liberty, and a yoak more intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than the Law would be on my conscience. Now, that there is no probable reason, why persons should imagine evil in my hearing the present Ministers, notwithstanding what this Author saith, hath been, and shall be further shewed, in answering that which is said by this Author.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Author doth not mention that, which, in the case of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was requisite to Scandal given, to wit, that the Scandal should be fore-seen, as the words 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.27, 28 intimate; and that not only as possible, but also as future, with some moral certainty, by reason of the presence of persons known to scruple the thing I do, or some one that intimates his dislike of my action. <hi>Calvin</hi> therefore upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8 13. saith, Non jubet nos Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus divinare nunquid offendiculo futurum sit quod facimus, nisi cum est praesens periculum. <hi>The Apostle doth not bid us divine, whether that we do will offend, but when there is present danger.</hi> Now this shews, that the hearing the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters is not Scandal given, where none are present that are offended, nor any give intimation of the futurity of the offence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This Author doth not take notice, that Scandal given by the use of our liberty, is not to be made perpetual, as the Apostles words in the same place shew: For if I must alwayes abstain from that at which another is offended, it will be made sin in it self, and so not Scandal given by the intempestive use of our liberty in a thing indifferent: but that we must not yield to, that we may not lose Truth for
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100176:154"/>
peace sake: But if men must not hear the present Ministers, for the reasons given, they must never do it to avoid of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which will be perpetual, and so the scandal suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be given, not such as that which was in the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> liberty, in eating Idolothytes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It should not have been forgotten, That the case of the offended among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by eating Idolothytes, and the Brethren now in <hi>England,</hi> for hearing the present Ministers, cannot be parallel'd rightly: because the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> offence was at the time, wherein the Gospel had been but lately preached to them, and the Doctrine of Gospel-liberty not fully cleared, which cannot be said of Christian Professors in <hi>England,</hi> who have been fully instructed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and therefore, in the use of our liberty now, cannot be the like offence given, and not taken only, as was in those dayes among the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> Yet this Author thus char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them with Scandal given.</p>

To deliver the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of people from such a slavery (worse than the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of the Mosaical Law) which this principle brings to, I conceive my self bound to do my best, and to decry it as Antichristian.

I find cause, I confess, to mourn on their behalf, and to pitty them, whom I have heard or seen offended at my actions, which they never examine, nor by conference, or otherwise, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the reasons or equity of them, taking reports up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trust, and judging them evil, without any brotherly affection, or sober consideration.

that way; it may be, adherence to a party, interest in their affections, that, I say no more, retains him still in this way: Yet would he take this ill; and why he should do to other, what he would not they should do to him, I see no cause: Christ taught otherwise, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12. But to the question, I answer, It is their duty to hear the present Ministers, while they preach the Gospel, or Word of God: And though, by immediate precept, a man is not bound to hear this or that particular Minister, of this or that way of Church-government or perswasion, but is at liberty to choose, as may be (all things considered) for his conveniency; yet, if other things concurr, he ought to hear such, as the providence of God hath placed over him, or near his habitation, though he be not chosen by himself to be his Pastour, which I think may be proved from 1 <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not to multiply more particulars, let us, in a few words, make application of these remarkes to the business in hand. Is there any thing in the world, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a greater brightness and evidence with it, than this, That the hearing the present Ministers of</hi> England, <hi>is to be partakers with them in their sin? Is not our so doing, a secret consenting with them, and encouraging of them in their evil deeds? Is this to discharge those duties incumbent upon us (if we indeed look upon them as Brethren) for their reclaiming? Yea, is this to come out of, and separate from them? What less? So then, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it can be proved, that the particulars instanc'd in, are not some of those wayes, whereby persons do become guilty of parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with other mens sins: Or, that to attend upon the present Ministers of</hi> England, <hi>is not what doth symbolize with some one, more, or all of them, (which can never be done) it evidently follows, That tis not lawful for Saints to hear the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of</hi> England, <hi>the doing whereof, is apparently a partaking with them in their evil deeds.</hi>

Nor do I except against the Texts brought to prove these, except that <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. which I have said before, in my <hi>Answer to the Preface of this Book, sect.</hi> 15. is a rule, not of reproving all sorts of sins, but only of particular injuries; and that <hi>telling the Church,</hi> is not telling a particular separate Congregation in the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent way, but such a number of Brethren (as may be fit to compose the difference) above two or three: and that not of necessity, so as if the Complainant did not do, it should be his sin; but as of indulgence and conveniency, as being the way fittest to rectifie the Offendor. The last way of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking with other mens sins is not true, to wit, that if after admonition, and obstinacy of the Offendor, we joyn in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of God, praying with him, receiving the Lords Supper, we are partakers with the Minister that preacheth,

If we should permit the <hi>Separatists</hi> to preach, we should consent secretly with them, and encourage them in their evil deeds, such as they conceive their gathering a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Congregation, and taking their mission from it, to be. Yet we have more of this doughty Demonstration, in a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical way of disputing, by questioning, <hi>Is this to discharge those duties incumbent upon us (if we indeed look upon them as Brethren) for their reclaiming?</hi> It seems it can hardly go down with this Author, to call them Brethren, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity hath unchristened them. But I answer, If it be not the discharging their duty, for the reclaiming them (which as it is stated, would perhaps be rather their sin, than their duty) yet it is to discharge their duty in hearing Gods Word, which is so farr from hindring them in the discharge of any duty incumbent on them, for the reclaiming of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters from any sin, they are to reprove in them, that it rather fits them for it. For the hearing them, shews, they do not, as this Author, count them their, or the Lords enemies, which makes a reproof to be better taken, and is agreeable to the Apostles rule, even when we shun the company of any that is unruly, <hi>to count him not as an enemy, but to admonish him as a brother,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.15. But doth indeed this Author think it the duty of every hearer, to reclaim, or else separate from every Minister, that either enters into his ministry unduly, or doth not discharge his function as he should? Suppose a <hi>John de Cluse</hi> is unduly made an Elder, or a <hi>Johnson</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicate his Brother and Father rashly, an <hi>Ainsworth</hi> disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with <hi>Johnson</hi> or <hi>Robinson,</hi> about private communion with the members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a <hi>Wheel-wright</hi> vent <hi>Antinomian</hi> errours, must every hearer reclaim them, or separate from them, or be guilty of their sin? They that leave the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be in Congregations of such principles, would find it to be matter of repentance: to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Episcopal government, to be under popular, would be like Tinkers work, to stop one hole and to make two; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der shew of better Discipline, to introduce Anarchy and confusion. But enough of answer to this wild Argument, in which the Author accuseth deeply, but brings no proof, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puts questions for proofs, and would have the Defendant prove himself Not guilty, when it concerned the Accuser to prove his Indictment. I hasten to the remainder.</p>

And indeed to injoyn Christians Members of a Congregational Church, or other Christians to hear onely such Officers, is both against the doctrine and practise approved in the Scripture, against the practise of the Congregational Churches themselves, and if it be urged rigidly according to this principle of this Authour, puts such a yoke of bondage on the consciences of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100176:166"/>
Christians, as is intolerable and pernicious. For 1. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel are according to Christs design, for the benefit of all Christians, not appropriate to this or that particular number of men, so as not to act as Ministers of his appointment, but in particular gathered Churches. It may be requisite perhaps for good order and government, to assign particular places to them, and this is of Divine and Apostolical institution, that in particular Churches there should be Pastors and Elders, and that they should be bound to be resident with them, and to feed them: But that no other then such should be Officers of Christ, is not proved; If there be not Apostles, Prophets or Evangelists now, as were in the Primitive times, yet I presume none will deny, that men may be Officers of Christ, that are assigned to no particular Charge; as Lecturers, Catechists, Readers in the Universities, Members of Synods, Commissioners for setling Churches in Discipline, for Approbation of Preachers, and the like; and they, being for the benefit of the Church of God, either in common, or more special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for some place, may be heard, or else the end of Christ in giving them should be frustrate. This I gather partly from the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. That not onely <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> but also <hi>Teachers are set by God in the Church</hi> indefinitely, not in this or that definite Church, and <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> as well as <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, Prophets</hi> and <hi>Evangelists,</hi> are given by Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.12. <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ,</hi> without the determinate assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some Saints, or some part of the body, but making them his gift to any Saints, or any part of the body which his providence shall order; partly, and chiefly, in that S. <hi>Paul</hi> counts it sinful <hi>glorying in men,</hi> to appropriate this or that Teacher as peculiar to some, and that because <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> and by the same reason every Minister was every Christians, in that every Christian <hi>was Christs, and he Gods</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22.

               <p n="3">3. That this is against the practise of the Congregational Churches, who do allow the hearing of gifted brethren that are not Officers, who send Preachers to convert the natives, such as Mr. <hi>Eliat,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> who yet are no Officers to them, who hear the Pastors of other Congregations, than those of which they are members; which is not agreeable to this Authours principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That other than their own Officers are strangers to them; and if it be, as some have delivered, That the Ministry is limited to that Church, to which he is Pastor, he cannot Preach as a Minister, when they hear him, nor they hear him under that consideration; and if a Minister be an Officer onely to the people who chose him, and they are bound to attend on his Ministery who chose him, and not others, then a Minister ceaseth to be a Minister when his Electors are dead, or removed; they that choose him not, though he be elected by the <hi>major</hi> part, are not to take him for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, nor may hear him, sith his voice is the voice of a stranger.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To be tied to attend on such mens Ministery, and not to have liberty to hear others, puts an yoke of bondage intolerable and pernicious on mens consciences. 1. In that in case the Minister become empty, or erroneous, yet being his Minister, and the <hi>major</hi> part adhere to him, he must also attend on his Ministery, who is weary of it, and may not use the benefit of anothers Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry more sound and profitable, no, not though it be of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for the finding out the truth, in that he doubts; which is an art like to the practise of the Papists, who will allow none of their Church to hear Protestant Preachers, or confer with them, or read their Books, lest their errours should be detected. Thus it might come to pass, that if Mr. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> deliver errour, his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might not go to hear Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> in the same Town, who might discover his errour; and there is the same reason concerning any in <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>London,</hi> a Minister to an Independent Church must be heard, though a man of mean abilities, and perhaps an

In case a member of a separated Church, as a woman removed with her husband from <hi>London</hi> into the Countrey, far from her Pastour, have a Godly learned able Teacher, who is a Conformist near her, and no other, she must not hear him, because a stranger, none of Christs Officers, but must rather live without the benefit of the publique Ordinance, though it be to the great decay of that spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, heat and vigour in godliness, which she once had. These, and more evil consequences attend the Position of this Authour, That those onely who are Christs Officers in his sense are to be heard. Yet he goes on thus:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Not to mention more, let it be weighed, whether the hearing of the present Ministers of</hi> England, <hi>doth not cast contempt upon these Institutions of Christ. What is more evidently Preached by such a practise, than</hi> 1. <hi>That separation from the Assemblies of</hi> England <hi>('though in their Constitution carnal and worldly) and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thereof (although false, and meerly of humane invention) was, and is our sin and evil.</hi> 2dly, <hi>That it's not by vertue of any Soveraign institution of Christ, the duty of Saints to meet together as a body distinct (without going out to other Assemblies to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with them) for their mutual edification in the Lord.</hi> 3dly, <hi>That particular Assemblies are not solely of the institution of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, but that National are also to be accounted as the true Churches of Christ (though they have no footing in the Scripture of the New Testament, from whence the pattern of Gospel-Churches is solely to be deduced) Yea</hi> 4thly, <hi>That the Officers of Christs appointment are not sufficient for the Saints; but together with them, the help of false and Idol-shepherds is to be sought after, than which, what greater contempt can be poured upon the forementioned Institutions of our dear Lord?

humane prudence, without bottom in the Scripture, and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ to be onely (in contradistinction to the Ministers that are not of his appointment) attended unto; why give they the right hand of fellowship unto such Assemblies, as profess themselves to be parts of such a National Church, and hear Ministers that have relation thereunto? who have received (as hath been proved) no mission from Christ to their Ministry.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I acknowledge that he who granteth your Premisses, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny your Conclusion: But none, but dissemblers, will attend on the Ministry of the present Ministers, and hold the <hi>Assemblies of</hi> England <hi>in their constitution, carnal and worldly, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thereof false, and meerly of humane invention; That the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Assemblies of the</hi> English <hi>Church, are the world in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinction to the Saints; That they are the worshippers of the world, not of the true Churches of Christ; That the Ministers are false and Idol-shepherds, who have received no mission from Christ to their Ministry.</hi> By this Answer this Authour may perceive, that these charges are judged false criminations, not at all proved by him; nor are those things granted to be Institutions of Christ, which he makes such: And therefore if the practise of going to the Parish-Assemblies be a casting contempt on his way, it is not on Christs Institutions, but his unjustifiable separation. And yet the truth is, our hearing the present Ministers, is for the performance of our own duty; that we may hear the word of God, and worship God truly; and our doing this we account not any approbation of any thing evil in the Ministers, or giving the right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to the Assemblies in any thing that is disorderly. Nor do we condemn any thing but their sin, in the separated meetings, whose separation we declare against, although we should not think it evil to hear their Ministers Preach the word of God, or to worship God with them. We are of opinion that it is a gross errour, which is often in the mouths of Separatists, That <hi>they may not hear with the world,</hi> nor <hi>pray with the world</hi>; whence it hath come to pass, that some have left off praying in their Families, Catechizing their children, instructing their servants, unless members of their Churches; which tends to bring in irreligion and profaneness, and is contrary to the precepts of Scripture, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contrary to the practise of Christ and his disciples, who heard Christ Preach with the scribes and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> praised God

with the multitude, even the children, Christ approving it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.37, 40. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.9.15, 16. And however we approve not any evil in the Ministers, or their Ministration, nor do assent to any unfitting thing therein, yet <hi>we</hi> rejoyce that Gods word is taught, and his Name invocated in any company by any persons, and think we have the Apostles example to warrant us, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.18 and do wish, that God would not lay to the Separatists charge, besides other sins (which we think are nor a few in these withdrawings from Communion, and invectives) their ingratitude for that bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit others have, and they might have, from that Ministry they so much oppose. If this Authour, or those of his way suffer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, reproach, and hard usage, though we wish it may not be, yet it may be told them, That not Christs Institutions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, but their own intemperate carriage is rebuked; which is not likely ever to succeed well, but to be a hindrance to the work of Christ, and the peace of his Church.

by the rule, which is the onely remedy against such events.

And for the Baalims then and there worshipped, they were even as the lesser Gods at this day, which are called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons among the Papists. The Devil, to the end he might bring in again the old Idolatry, craftily borrowing the names of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Martyrs, by whom it was in former times overthrown and driven away: and by this means it hath put on another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that it might not be known. Whereupon it followeth by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, That as the temples, altars, and high places for those Baalims, and other Idols, were by godly Kings to be raced down and taken away, and no way to be imployed to the true worship of God so are the temples (with their appurtenances) built to the Virgin</hi> Mary, Peter, Paul, <hi>and the rest, though true Saints, yet the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists false Gods, and very Baalims, to be demolished and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the same lawful authority; and in the mean while as execrable things to be avoided by them, which have none authority to deface or demolish them.</hi> p. 357. <hi>The moral equity of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments in the old Testament, touching the demolition and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of idolatrous temples, and other the like superstitious monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, doth as well bind now as then.

And, though the chief leaders of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stational Churches not long ago did Preach and hear in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Temples in <hi>England,</hi> yet it seems this Authour now holds it unlawful to attend upon the present Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> not onely because of their calling and worship, but also because of the places in which it is performed; and therefore seems to revive the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie about the use of places once polluted by Idolatry.

that men pretending tenderness of conscience, should be so impudent as still to accuse Protestants as <hi>receiving the mark of the beast,</hi> and <hi>staying in Babylon,</hi> even for that for which the holy Martyrs died in opposition to Popery. But if it be true which Mr. <hi>Paget</hi> hath in his Arrow <hi>p.</hi> 29. Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> was not constant to this opinion. As for what this Authour saith, <hi>The Common-prayer-book-worship is proved by him to be false worship,</hi> it hath been shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to be true in the answer to all he saith here. Yet were there some superstition in the worship prescribed in the Common Prayer Book, it is not sufficient to make the places, in which the present Ministers and people meet, <hi>places or assemblies of false worship,</hi> every corruption in Gods worship not making the place or assembly to be a place or assembly of false worship, as is manifest, both in the case of the sin of <hi>Hophni,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.17. of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, 21, 22. &amp; 14.26. Nor if the places and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were for some corruption, yet were it necessary to go out of them, except they were idolatrous. For so were the going up to <hi>Gilgal, Bethaven,</hi> or <hi>Bethel</hi> forbidden, <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.4. to offer sacrifice to the calves set up by <hi>Jeroboam</hi>; which therefore prove not <hi>going to a place of false worship</hi> to be forbidden, except it be idolatrous, and to joyn in that worship; and therefore the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent of this Authours argument is denied, if it be meant of false worship, that is not idolatrous. Gods people were required to go to the temple at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> after it had been defiled with Idolatry, and the Idol removed; and even then when corpuptions of buying and selling there, and will-worship was in sundry things continued there, yet our Lord Christ himself went up to the Temple at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi> The consequence also is denied, it being false, that <hi>we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not go to hear the present Ministers of</hi> England, <hi>without we go to their places and assemblies of false worship.</hi> To which I add, That this is contrary to our Saviours doctrine, <hi>John</hi> 4.21, 22, 23. to tie men to worship onely in the place and assembly of the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Churches, and contrary to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. to forbid any to worship God in any place; and therefore herein this Authour, and such separatists as are of his mind, are guilty of Judaizing. But he goeth on thus:</p>

                  <hi>Argument</hi> 11. <hi>That, upon the doing whereof Saints have no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of a blessing, nor any ground to expect it, is not lawful for

If there be any promise of a blessing upon them from God, in their so doing, let it be produced, and we shall willingly confess, there is no weight in this argument: But this we conceive to be no easie task for any to discharge, and that for these reasons:</hi> 1. <hi>The blessing of the Lord is upon Sion,</hi> Psal. 87.2. &amp; 78.68. <hi>there he dwells,</hi> Psal. 9.11. &amp; 74.2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Blessings are of many sorts: Any good in general, yea any immunity or freedom from evil, is a blessing in a large sense; But in a strict sense, that onely is called a blessing, which is the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100176:171"/>
conferring of some special good, whether temporal or eternal, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or, spiritual. In the former sense the <hi>major</hi> is true. It is not lawful for the Saints to do that which there is no promise of good to them upon doing it, nor ground to expect that the person shall not be punished for it. But if it be meant of good, as of long life to the honouring of parents, eternal life to believing on Christ, there are many things the Saints have no promise of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al good to be conferred on them for doing them, nor ground to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any such blessing, but what is common to all men, and yet the thing is lawful to be done by them, as eating and drinking for their sustenance, buying and selling, planting, building, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> common to other men with them, and in this strict sense (in which this Authour takes it) the <hi>major</hi> is not true: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> Preached lawfully when he was told Israel would not hearken, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.2, 7. and <hi>Jonah,</hi> when he thought <hi>Nineveh</hi> would not repent, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4.2. But to wave this exception, the <hi>minor</hi> is not true: I assert the Saints have a promise of spiritual blessing by hearing these men, while they Preach the Gospel, as much as any Preachers in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Churches, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Hear and your soul shall live. Luke</hi> 11.28. <hi>Blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it,</hi> are promises made to them that hear the Prelatical Preachers, as well as to those of the separated Churches, while they Preach the same word of God: the promise being not made to the hearing of the men because of their personal qualities, their Church-relation, or any such consideration extrinsecal to the faithful discharge of the work of Preaching, but to the teaching of Gods word: in hearing of which men have been blessed, though the Teachers themselves had no blessing, the hearers have been saved, when the Preachers themselves have been castaways, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks. And if we look to experience of former times, there is ground now to expect a blessing fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> conforming Preachers, as well, or rather more, then from Preachers of the separated Churches. Sure the <hi>conversion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, strengthening, establishing of souls</hi> in the truth, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h been more in <hi>England</hi> from Preachers, who were enemies to separation, whether Non-conformists to Ceremonies, or Conformists Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial or Episcopal, even from Bishops themselves, then from the best of the Separaratists. I think all that are acquainted with the History of things in this last age, will acknowledge that more good hath been to the souls of men by the Preaching of <hi>Usher, Potter, Abbot, Jewel,</hi> and some other Bishops, by <hi>Preston, Sibs, Taylour, Whately, Hildersham, Ball, Perkins, Dod, Stock,</hi> and many thousands ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to the separated Churches, then ever was done by
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:100176:172"/>
                  <hi>Ainsworth, Johnson, Robinson,</hi> rigid Separatists, or <hi>Cotton, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Hooker</hi> and others (though men of precious memory) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of the way of the Churches Congregational. And therefore if the Bishops, and conforming Preachers now apply themselves (as we hope when the heat of contention is more allayed, they will) to the profitable way of Preaching against Popery and profaneness, exciting auditors to the life of faith in Christ, duties of holiness towards God not onely in publique, but also in private Families, and righteousness, love, peace towards men, there may be as good ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not better (considering how much the spirits of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists are for their party, and the <hi>speaking of the truth in love, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying in love</hi> is necessary to <hi>the growth of the body, Ephes.</hi> 4.15, 16.) to expect by them a blessing in promoting the power of godliness than from Separatists. And as for this Authours reasons to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, The first of them is from a fond application of what is said of <hi>Gods dwelling in Sion</hi> (which is meant of the special presence there, in that his Temple and service was upon that hill in the time of the old Testament) to the Congregational Churches, as if Gods blessing were appropriated to them, and excluded from the Assemblies of <hi>England,</hi> they were not <hi>the Sion of God in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent constitution,</hi> nor <hi>Christs Candlestick,</hi> or <hi>Garden in which he walks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a wilderness, that Babel,</hi> Revel. 18.4. And saith, <hi>we are not surer of any thing than we are of this</hi>; which if true, it is an article of his Creed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which he is as sure as that Jesus is the Christ. But he gives no proof of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to assure us of it, but that we may take him to be phrenetick, or to be in a dream; and, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his confidence, he can make no better proof of this then the Romanists can for the new Article of their Creed, <hi>Subes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se Romano Pontifici, est de necessitate ad salutem.</hi> It is indeed said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22. That the <hi>Hebrew Christians were come to mount Sion,</hi> in opposition to mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> that is to say <hi>(say the Annot.) to the Church under the Gospel, as</hi> Gal. 4.26. <hi>whereof mount Sion was a Type,</hi> Psal. 14.7. &amp; 50.20 Esa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.3. <hi>and where the Gospel was first proclaimed without that terrour wherewith the Law was delivered,</hi> Esa. 2.3. But why the <hi>Assemblies of</hi> England should not be <hi>the Sion of God</hi> as well as the separated Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no reason is given, but the vain conceit that of late he and others have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of appropriating that title to Churches of their way, whose maintenance of Ministers by Collection, they call the <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sion,</hi> Psal. 132.15. in opposition to maintenance by Tithes, counted Babylonish, with such like language, whereby many well-meaning Christians of weak judgement are misled.
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100176:172"/>
Sure if the <hi>Church</hi> be called <hi>mount Sion</hi> from the Preaching of the Gospel, the <hi>Assemblies of England</hi> may be called <hi>Sion, Christs Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks</hi> and <hi>Garden,</hi> as well as any Christians in the world: and if the Constitution of Churches is by faith, their Constitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is as good as the Constitution of the separated Churches. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the separated Churches, which have consisted of persons converted and instructed, and edified in the Assemblies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> should have acknowledged that Gods blessing may be in them, their own calling therein proving it, if there were any spark of ingenuity and love of truth in them, and not, as this Authour, express such malignity as to make them a <hi>very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and that Babel out of which the Lord commands his people to hasten their escape,</hi> Revel. 18.4. which how grossly it hath been abused by this Authour, sundry times before hath been shewed; for which I now onely say, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee.</hi> As for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reason, the <hi>worship of England</hi> is no more <hi>polluted and not of his appointment,</hi> then I have shewed to have been in the <hi>Jewish, Corinthian,</hi> some of the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches, whom Christ yet <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the midst of,</hi> as his <hi>golden Candlesticks,</hi> and yet <hi>Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> did belong to them. And why should we not expect Gods blessing to be on the Assemblies of <hi>England,</hi> in which the true faith is preached, and the true worship of God is constituted, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding errours or pollutions remaining in them? That <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.32. is wrongfully applied to the present Ministers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is shewed before in <hi>answer</hi> to <hi>Ch.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. And how shamefully <hi>(mirum ni contra conscientiam) Revel.</hi> 18.4. is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to <hi>a call of Gods people out of the Church of England,</hi> when it is by the holy Ghost interpreted <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.18. of <hi>that great City which then reigned over the Kings of the earth,</hi> and acknowledged by <hi>Papists,</hi> the <hi>Jesuites</hi> themselves to be Rome, hath been often shewed before. In his last reason, that which he saith, That <hi>God is not in respect of his special presence and grace, in the midst of the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Assemblies of England,</hi> is a speech of a man of an uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble venemous spirit; but we hope such as that which <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks of, Prov. 26.2. <hi>As the bird by wandring, as the swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.</hi> And to his question, <hi>Where are the souls that are converted, comforted, strengthened, stablished, that are waiting at the doors of their house?</hi> I say, that though there were none such, yet this proves not God not to be present in them; if they complain of the little effect of their Preaching, is it any other then we meet with else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49.4. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.1. <hi>John</hi> 12.38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.16.

                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>Matth,</hi> 23.37? May they not say, That these very men that upbraid them with the paucity of their converts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are the cause thereof, by their invectives begetting enmity and prejudice against them in the minds of men? May it not be said to themselves, Where are the souls that are converted, comforted, strengthened, stablished by your Ministry? Were not many, if not most in your Churches wrought upon at first by other Preachers? And if so, may it not be said, Ye your selves are <hi>the seal of their Ministry in the Lord?</hi> nevertheless, though God onely can tell exactly and fully, what is the fruit of any mens Ministry, yet I hope there are that can testifie their receiving good by the Ministry of some of the present Ministers; and that, however it be, by reason of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stumbling-blocks cast in the way, God will yet have mercy on the people of <hi>England,</hi> and give them hearts to receive the truth Preached to them in the love of it. Sure this Authour should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray it may be so, and encourage the Ministers to do the work of the Lord more faithfully, and not weaken their hands by drawing their auditors from them. As for that which he saith of the decaies of the auditors of the Ministers, I joyn with him; but add withall, That, so far as mine acquaintance, or intelligence reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, there is too great and sensible a decay of the <hi>spirit of love, power, and of a sound mind</hi> in the Congregational Churches of old and new <hi>England,</hi> and that a spirit of bitterness, consorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, misreporting, mistaking dissenters words and actions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rghteousness, unpeaceableness is too abundant in them, that I say nothing of their proneness to embrace Antinomianism, Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism, and other dangerous errours. <hi>Iliacos intra muros peccatur &amp; extra.</hi> The Lord pardon our evils, and heal our breaches.

               <p>
                  <hi>HAving hitherto been upon the Confirmation of the truth asserted by us,</hi> viz. <hi>That 'tis not lawfull for Saints to hear the present Ministers of</hi> England, <hi>we come now to consider, what is in this matter objected by our d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssenting Brethren. This is that they say,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 1. <hi>Christ commands (or at least permits) his Disciples to hear the Scribes and Pharisees (who were men as corrupt in their doctrine, as vicious in their lives, as the present Ministers of</hi> England <hi>can be supposed to be</hi>) Matth. 23.1, 2. <hi>Therefore it is lawfull to hear these.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>This being the main Objection used by our dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in this day (as it was by others in times past) their very</hi> Achilles <hi>in this controversie, we shall speak the more largely to it.</hi> To which I reply, that this is justly urged to prove it lawfull to hear the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> preaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the doctrine of Christ, because Christ allowed his Disciples and the multitudes hearing the Scribes and Pharisees teaching the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they were erroneous, vicious, intruders in that busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as much or more than are the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the office, or work of preaching the Gospel. That the force of this reason may be perceived, it is to be noted, that it was the office of the Priest, who were to be of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> to instruct the people in the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> as we find the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7 <hi>The Priests lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth, for he was the Messenger of the Lord of Hosts,</hi> yet there they are complained of to <hi>have departed out of the way, to have caused many to stumble at the law, to have been partial in the law, v.</hi> 18, 9. Which occasioned, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after the return from the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the rising of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100176:176"/>
sundry Sects among the Jews, as <hi>Sadduces,</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> known by their peculiar tenents and usages, who were not all, nor necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> as it is certain concerning St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was a <hi>Pharisee, and the son of a Pharisee</hi> Acts 23.6. yet <hi>of the Tribe of Benjamin, Philip.</hi> 3.5. which therefore had no special function of teaching committed to them by God, having neither extraordinary nor ordinary calling of God, but had betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to that way, as the orders of Friers among the Papists, by their voluntary choice, yet, as the Friers among the Papists, so the <hi>Pharisees</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> bare the greatest sway with the common people, as having greatest influence upon their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in matters of Religion, and in process of time greatest power in the government of the State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though they were not the ordinary Magistrates. Now to these <hi>Pharisees</hi> were adjoyned <hi>Scribes,</hi> who were Writers, Teachers, Expositors, Disputers, Rabbins, Masters, Lawyers, or Doctors of the Law, among whom our Saviour is <hi>said to sit at</hi> 12 <hi>years old in the Temple hearing them, and asking them questions, Luke</hi> 2.46. By which it is apparent, that they which were then the Doctors of the law used to sit in the Temple to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve cases about the law; for which reason they were said <hi>to sit in the seat of Moses, Matth.</hi> 23.2. Concerning whom, though our Lord Christ had charged them with corrupting the law by their traditions <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.8 and had warned his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to <hi>take heed of the leaven of their Doctrine, Matth.</hi> 16.6 11.12. yet <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.1, 2, 3. he spake <hi>to the multittude, and to his Disciples, saying, the Scribes and Pharises sit in Moses seat: All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say and do not.</hi> Now our Lord Christs appointing them to observe what they bid, shews he allowed or permitted their hearing them; (for otherwise they could not observe what they bid them) yet not absolutely, for then he should have contradicted himself in warning them against their traditions, and the leaven of their Doctrine, but conditionally or respectively, that is what they bid them do according to the law of <hi>Moses, in whose seat they sate,</hi> that is took upon them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounders of the law of <hi>Moses.</hi> Whence it is inferred, that while the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> teach the doctrine of Christ, they may be heard notwithstanding defects in their calling, and their personal evils, as the hearing of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> was allowed by Christ to his Disciples. And the Argument may be formed thus. That hearing of Ministers against which there is no more just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception than was against the hearing of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharises sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100176:177"/>
in the seat of Moses</hi> in Christs time by his Disciples, is lawful for Christian Saints now: But there is no more just exception against hearing the present Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> than was against hearing of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees sitting in the seat of Moses</hi> in Christs time by his Disciples. Therefore the hearing the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> is lawfull to Christian Saints now. The <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> proceeds on this rule, that what in the same case our Lord Christ allowed to his Disciples then, is allowed by him to Christian Saints now, which, if it be not granted, Christs resolutions then are no satisfactions or directions to our Consciences now, which were to make those Scriptures useless, which were blasphemous. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved by shewing the exceptions against hearing the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are not greater nor more just then against the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and the hearing of them, nor the Christian Saints now any more forbidden to hear the present Ministers, than the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ then to hear the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees.</hi> Again, we may thus argue, That which warranted Christs Disciples hearing the Scribes and Pharisees in his time notwithstanding other defects warrants the Saints hearing of the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi>; now notwithstanding other defects which is grounded on such rules of Logick as these <hi>De paribus idem est judicium,</hi> Of things alike we are to have the like judgement <hi>Idem quà idem semper facit idem,</hi> the same consequent follows on the same reason as it is the same. But the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> preaching or declaring the will of God warranted Christs Disciples hearing the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> in his time notwithstanding other defects. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the present Ministers preaching or declaring the will of God notwithstanding other defects warrants the Saints hearing now the present Ministers of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is grounded upon that, which is intimated to be the reason of Christs direction <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.2, 3. that <hi>they sate in Moses his chair,</hi> that is taught the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Law, and that what <hi>they bid them observe</hi> according to it <hi>they were to hear</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> as on the contrary they were not, when they taught corrupt traditions of men, and other leavened Doctrine. To these things this Author thus answers.</p>

never be able to prove; and yet they are the very basis upon which the stress of the Objection lies. As</hi> 1. <hi>'Tis supposed that the Scribes and Pharisees here spoken of, were in the Ministerial seat, Teachers and Expounders of the Law, which at first view seems to be a difficult task for any to demonstrate, That some of the Scribes and Pharisees (which were particular Sects among the Jews, as is known) were so, cannot be denied; that these here mentioned by our Saviour are such, is not so evident. They are expresly said to sit in</hi> Moses <hi>seat (not</hi> Aarons) <hi>who though he were of the Tribe of Levi, yet was not the Ministerial, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistratical seat committed to him. To the posterity of</hi> Aaron <hi>did the office of Priesthood appertain (as is known to all that have but in the least turned aside to consider of this affair) nor is it altogether frivolous, that is by some observed, that these Scribes and Pharisees are especially charged with the omission of judgement and mercy; things most nearly relating unto the Office of Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to whom it doth especially appertain to look thereunto. Nor will it in the least follow, that supposing Christ enjoyned his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to attend upon the Scribes and Phariseees, acting as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and conform to what is justly and righteously prescribed by them as such: That therefore it is lawful to attend upon the present Ministers of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>I reply, That it is indeed supposed, that <hi>the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees here spoken of, were in the seat of</hi> Moses, <hi>Teachers and Expounders of the Law:</hi> But not that they were Officers about the sacrifices and services belonging to the worship of God at the Templé, as were the Priests and Levites; nor need we so to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: It is sufficient for rhe Argument, That they took upon them the expounding of the Law, and to resolve consciences, what they were to do, they did as Casuists or Doctors of Divinity in Schools or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, or in the Temple: Which is proved from that which is said, That <hi>they did bind heavy burdens, and lay them on mens shoulders,</hi> v. 4. which was by their precepts, their affecting to <hi>be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi, Masters, Fathers, <gap reason="foreign">

For the power and office of <hi>Moses,</hi> whether as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, Judge, or Prophet, was singular. He was <hi>a Prophet to whom there arose none like in Israel,</hi> Deut. 34.10. and he was a Judge or Prince under God supreme, who had jurisdiction and Empire supreme, in matters sacred and profane, although the function of doing holy rites was committed to <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sons, and the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> as is proved by <hi>Selden,</hi> l. 2. <hi>de Syned.

It is not denied, that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> were many of them Rulers of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as it is said of <hi>Nicodemus, John</hi> 3.1. and of the <hi>Priests and Levites John</hi> 1.19.24. But not as Scribes or Pharisees, who were, as such, onely <hi>particular Sects among the</hi> Jews, as this Authour truly acknowledgeth: nor as <hi>sitting in Moses chair,</hi> which onely noted their function of teaching and expounding of the Law, being bred up at the feet of Rabbins or Doctors of the Law, as St. <hi>Paul at the feet of Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel,</hi> and after sitting in the School, or auditory of the Temple or Synagogues, where <hi>Moses of old time had in every City them that preached him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath-day,</hi> Acts 15.21. wherein the <hi>Scribes and Pharisees affected</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>the chief seats,</hi> Matth. 23 6. and had much sway with the people, though they taught not with such <hi>authority as Christ did,</hi> Matth. 7.26.

               </p>
               <p>I reply, that this grant, <hi>that the Scribes and Pharisees were preachers and expounders of the Law in that day,</hi> will help the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectours in the matter in controversie, though it be not granted to them, that <hi>the Scribes and Pharisees were not a lawfull, but a false Ministry, that had surrepticiously climbed up into this ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial seat.</hi> For they are assured, that this Author hath not proved, nor can prove <hi>the present Ministers of</hi> England <hi>to be meer intruders and Ministers of Antichrist,</hi> and therefore need not this supposition concerning the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> to prove Christs allowing the hearing of the present Ministers. Only this is urged, that there is as much exception and more against the <hi>Pharisees</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than against the present Ministers, and yet they might be heard, therefore with better reason may the present Ministers be heard. Nevertheless I deny, that the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> which they were to hear, <hi>were the lawfull Church Officers of that day, of the appointment of the Lord, acting by vertue of an authority deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him,</hi> it being certain that, as he saith, they <hi>were a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sect among the Jews,</hi> no where appointed by God to this office of Priesthood or teaching, but taken up by men, as orders of Friers among the Papists, though some of them were Priests, and some of them Rabbins, or teachers of the law, and educated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as teachers of Divinity are in the Schools among us at this day; which, if the Ministers of <hi>England</hi> had no further ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being the condition of most, or very many of the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in <hi>England</hi> might justifie the hearing of them as well as the hearing the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who had no better calling to that function. As for the reasons of this Author, the first is not valid. For it proves only that some of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> were <hi>Pharisees,</hi> not all, St. <hi>Paul</hi> certainly was not, though a <hi>Pharisee</hi>; nor that those that sate in <hi>Moses</hi> chair were Priests, for all were not there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many thousands of <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who were not Rabbins. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee, when he sate at Gamaliels feet,</hi> Acts 22.3. yet not a Doctor of the Law <hi>sitting in Moses his
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100176:179"/>
chair.</hi> Nor, if they were Priests, doth it prove <hi>they were the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers of that day.</hi> For, to say nothing of Christs Apostles, who were at that day the lawfull Ministers with and under Christ himself, it is certain the Priests of those times got their places, as for instance the High Priest by undue and unlawfull wayes, by bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the <hi>Roman</hi> Deputy, as <hi>Josephus</hi> reports, and therefore if it were proved, they were Priests, yet they are not proved to be lawful Ministers. Yea that which is said of their Ordination, and Education by the most favourable Writers of <hi>the Jewes,</hi> proves they had some kind of entrance into their profession according to the customs of those times, which were of human invention, but nothing of Gods institution, that they should <hi>sit in the chair of Moses.</hi> As for the Second reason, there is no marvel they had the impudence to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iohns</hi> authority, though themselves intruders, when they were puft up with conceits of their authority, though they had none, when they were so proud and impudent as to conceive themselves <hi>righteous and despise others,</hi> Luke 18.9. and to allege it in prayer to God, though their Consciences might tell them they were cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and unrighteous, yea <hi>to deride Christ, when he told them they could not serve God and Mammon,</hi> Luke 16.14. Nor is the Third reason of force, For Christ might question their authority though he did not when they questioned <hi>Johns,</hi> and he seems after <hi>John</hi> to have done it in calling them a <hi>generation of vipers, blind guides,</hi> with sundry other expressions disparaging of them and their tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; And his charging them with affectation and ambitious <hi>seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the chief Seats, and to be called Rabbi, Rabbi,</hi> what is it but an evidence, that they did <hi>unlawfully climb into Moses his seat,</hi> which they did so ambitiously gape after? As for <hi>the not</hi> in express words <hi>charging them with usurpation,</hi> it is no marvail it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, sith their instigation of <hi>Herod</hi> to take away <hi>John Baptists</hi> life related by <hi>Iosephus</hi> is not related, as imputed to them, by Christ in any of the Evangelists; Besides how irrational this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, <hi>we read not, that Christ charged them with usurpation of Moses seat, therefore he did it not,</hi> every puny in Schools knows, who hath learned that rule in Logick, <hi>argumentum non valet ab au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate negativè, an argument from testimony negatively is not of force,</hi> especially in matters of fact, <hi>it is not related, therefore it was not done</hi>; and most of all concerning Christs acts, of which it is noted, that <hi>many things are not written,</hi> John 21.25.</p>

               <p>Yet again saith this Author, <hi>But let this also be granted, that we may hear this Argument, speak its uttermost, The Scribes and Pharisees sit in</hi> Moses <hi>seat; this seat is a ministerial seat, and they sit not here by virtue of any lawfull authority, but are meer intruders; what follows from hence? Why this, if it were lawfull to hear the Scribes and Pharisees, persons vicious in their lives, corrupt in their doctrine, having no lawfull call to the place they possessed: then it undeniably follows, that its lawfull to hear the present Ministers of</hi> England, <hi>though they have no lawfull authority or call to the office they assume. It must it seems, then</hi> 3dly, <hi>be granted, that when Christ sayes, what they say unto you, do, he is to be interpreted, to command, or at least, to permit an attendance upon their Ministry. But this is that we deny, and dare confidently aver, That it never entred into the heart of Christ to permit, much less to command any to attend upon the Ministry of the Scribes and Pharisees: nor is any such thing in the least intimated in the words under considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For first, the words are in the original</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I reply, the Argument is framed not as here by this Authour, but as I before formed it. The command to do what they bid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a permission to hear, else how could they do as they bid? Though the words <hi>v.</hi> 2. may be rendered, <hi>have sate in Moses chair,</hi> yet the words, <hi>v.</hi> 3. according to the <hi>Greek</hi> language, and, I think, according to all interpreters must be rendered, <hi>whatsoever they shall say unto you,</hi> it being a precept concerning their future actions, and the word render'd [<hi>sit</hi>] being in the first <hi>Aorist</hi> is best rendered, as noting an indefinite time, and so is to be conceived as signifying a continued time past and present, <hi>they have and still do sit.</hi> But were it granted, that the <hi>bidding</hi> were meant of the time past, the argument were of force, they heard, therefore they may hear, Christ not disapproving their former hearing, but giving a reason, which infers a continued permission to hear them, <hi>because
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100176:180"/>
they sate in Moses chair,</hi> that is, taught the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> so that he makes this the entire reason of their observing, and consequently of hearing, in that they bid them observe the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which while they did, they were to hear them, and observe them, not when they taught for doctrines the precepts of men: which is indeed the genuine reason of his caveat there and elsewhere, especially in the Sermon on the Mount, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. &amp; 6. &amp; 7. in which having said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Think not that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill,</hi> he then adds, <hi>that one Jot shall not pass from the law till all were fulfilled,</hi> that <hi>he would not have the least Commandement broken by practise or Doctrine,</hi> yet with monition, that <hi>their righteousness must exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, if they would enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and accordingly clears the law from their false glasses, warns his Disciples of their hypocritical practises, of their corrupt doctrine and traditions, directs persons to observe the rites of the law, while he was on earth, and to acquit himself from being an enemy to the law a little before his death, though he had late experience of their opposition, yet minds his Disciples that they should not neglect their teaching out of the law, though they were not to imitate their practise. Whence may be clearly discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Christ would have them heard teaching out of the law of God, notwithstanding other defects or corruptions, and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of this case is a plain rule to us, that we may lawfully hear such as teach truth, notwithstanding other defects and corruptions in their lives and Ministry: It is added,</p>

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Were that the intendment of Christ, as is suggested (and the argument of our brethren valid) a lawfulness to hear the veriest blasphemer in the world that denies that Christ is the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, affirms that he was a deluder of the people, a gluttonous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a winebibber, one that did miracles by Belzebub the prince of Devils, that persecutes even to death Christ in his people, might by a like parity of reason be deduced. Christ commanded, or at least permitted his disciples to hear the Pharisees who were such (as hath been proved) therefore 'tis lawful to hear persons with the same characters upon them. But God forbid any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious dealing should be offered to Christ, or that any who pretend to fear God (and I hope do so in reality) should stand by a cause which hath no better arguments to defend it, than what may be as righteously every way made use of for the attending upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the greatest blasphemer, or opposer of Christ in the world.

The Scribes and Pharisees mentioned</hi> Matth. 23.1, 2. <hi>may for ought we know be Magistrates, not Ministers; if Ministers, they were, as hath been proved, lawfully so: Christ says concerning them, Whatever they bid you observe and do, that observe and do. Therefore 'tis lawful to attend upon the Ministers of</hi> England, <hi>whose lawful calling to their office cannot be proved; yea, though there is not the least intimation of a command from Christ, or so much as a permission to his disciples to hear the Scribes aad Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi>—Nugae &amp; tricae siculae! <hi>If this be to dispute, a man need not fear but to be able to multiply arguments at an easie rate, for whatever he hath a mind to undertake the defence of: Yet this is supposed by many to be of greatest moment in this controversie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, If by <hi>attendance on the Ministry of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> be meant a constant and ordinary hearing of them as their ordinary shepherds (as this Authous words seem to import) doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less neither Christ did command, nor permit his disciples such an attendance, both for the reasons given by this Authour, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially because he asserts himself as their onely <hi>Master</hi> or <hi>Doctour,</hi> Matth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23.8.10. yet the mention of their <hi>sitting in</hi> Moses <hi>his chair</hi> or <hi>seat,</hi> notes more then their <hi>discourse upon particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional

meeting,</hi> to wit, their ordinary expounding the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in their Schools, where our Lord Christ permitted his disciples and the multitude to hear them with this limitation and proviso, in, and as they taught the Law; which hearing he did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them, but allow them with such caveats as are there given in that Chapter. And against such hearing, none of the reasons of this Authour are of force. Not the first: for though such personal evils were sufficient motives to keep back people, either from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their example or private counsels, yet not to keep them back from hearing Gods Law expounded by them The same answer is for the second reason; The permission of Christ is not to hear the <hi>Pharisees</hi> teach all the Doctrines of their Sect, he had before warned them of <hi>receiving their traditions,</hi> Matth. 15.14. <hi>the leaven of their doctrine,</hi> Matth. 16.12. In which no doubt they understood the doctrine about justification by the works of the Law, to be comprehended: But the permission of hearing them is onely as they <hi>sate in</hi> Moses <hi>his seat</hi>; that is, as they taught them the duties of <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, which he said, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.17. <hi>He came not to destroy, but to fulfil,</hi> which is manifest from the illative particle <hi>therefore,</hi> v. 2. because <hi>they sit in</hi> Moses <hi>seat, and bid you observe what Moses did, you are to observe what they bid you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</hi> and consequently may hear them so teaching. The third reason hath the same answer with this overplus, That to prevent any conceit of allowing the hearing of them in their blaphemy, he avoucheth himself to be their <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Teacher,</hi> v. 8.10. To the fourth it is but from a testimony negatively, and so of no force: We read not that they used the Lords Prayer, yet none will say they did not, less that they might not; we read not of their alms, or fasting, yet they might do both. To the fifth, it was but a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited permission of hearing them as they taught <hi>Moses</hi> Law, not as allowing constant attendance on them as their shepherds. Christ did conceive the people to be without a shepherd, notwithstanding the <hi>Pharisees</hi> teaching the duties of the Law, because though that doctrine were right, and to be observed, yet it was not sufficient to feed them to eternal life. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. St. <hi>Peter</hi> did well to exhort his auditors to <hi>save themselves from that untoward generation</hi> of opposers of Christ, as his Master before would have him and all his disciples do, not <hi>doing after their works,</hi> nor following their perverse doctrine, and the Church did rightly practice, <hi>in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Apostles Doctrine and fellowship, and breaking of bread, and prayer</hi>; yet he neither did, nor was to disswade them from hearing or practising the <hi>Pharisees</hi> doctrine of the observing the duties of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:100176:182"/>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, which they were obliged to observe. To the sixht, I grant it lawful to hear any man teach truth, which is Gods, and may be heard from the mouth of any man, with whom God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows us converse and communion as they are men; though we are to hold no communion with them in wickedness, nor willingly hear their blasphemies. That the <hi>Pharisees</hi> as such, were not <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,</hi> nor <hi>lawful Ministers,</hi> nor considered as such, is shewed before. Neither do we say that <hi>Christ permitted attendance on the Ministry of the Scribes and Pharisees as their Pastors,</hi> nor need we. It is sufficiene for our purpose, that Christ allowed the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them teaching <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and that proves it lawful to hear the present Ministers while, and so far as they teach truth; which hearing, not constant attending on their Ministry, was to be proved lawful, as the question was stated by this Authour, <hi>ch.</hi> 1. and all along was his conclusion.

                  <hi>That 'tis one thing to go into the synagogues, and another thing to go thither to attend upon the Ministry of such as taught there: This is the present case, which that Christ or the Apostles ever did, cannot be proved.</hi> 3. <hi>They went thither to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them in, and confute their innovations and traditions in the worship of God, to take an opportunity to teach and instruct the people in his way and will: which when any have a spirit to do, and are satisfied that they are thereunto called by the Lord, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the present Ministers and worship of</hi> England, <hi>we shall be so far from condemning them therein, that we shall bless God for them. But this is not to the purpose in hand: the attendance of our brethren upon the Ministers of</hi> England, <hi>is quite another thing, that requires other arguments for its support, than we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to met with. —Parvas habet spes Troia si tales habet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, It is clear from <hi>Luke</hi> 2.46. that our Lord <hi>went to the Temple at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>sate in the midst of the Doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</hi> Luke 4.16. <hi>That he came to</hi> Nazareth, <hi>where he had been brought up, and as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and stood up to read,</hi> that he cured persons there, Preached in the synagogues, that Peter <hi>and</hi> John <hi>went up together into the Temple at the hour of prayer the ninth,</hi> Acts 3.1. <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Barnabas <hi>went into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, and sate down, and did not speak to the people till after the reading of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them,</hi> Acts 13.14, 15. That <hi>on the sabbath St.</hi> Paul <hi>went out of</hi> Philippi <hi>by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made, and sate down</hi>; and that <hi>this was his manner,</hi> Acts 16, 13. and 17.2. Now neither were these synagogues by any appointment of God that we find, nor their meeting, nor their rulers, nor the order of their reading of the Law and the Prophets, nor their Teachers, nor their worship at the Temple without many corruptions; and yet our Lord and his Apostles were present at them, and joyned with them in hearing them read, and such other services of Religion as were done to God. Which is a good reason, wherefore it should not be counted necessary to separate from the present Assemblies in <hi>England,</hi> and the publick Ministers, notwithstanding such corruptions in their worship, such defect in their calling, such pullutions in the places of meeting, as are by this Authour and other Separatists urged as a sufficient reason of their separation. The answers hereto are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient. For 1. Though all that Christ and his Apostles did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of peculiar power or Commission, or instinct be not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Though Christ and his Apostles <hi>did not go into the Synagogues to attend on the Ministry of such as taught there,</hi> yet they did there hear the Law and Prophets read, and joyned in prayers, which this Authour will not allow his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to do in the Church Assemblies of <hi>England.</hi> 3. That <hi>Christ or his Apostles went into the Synagogues to oppose them in, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute their innovations, and traditions in the worship of God,</hi> is more than I remember to have read: nor do I know that any that have or shall come into the assemblies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to such an end, as Quakers and other Separatists heretofore have done, can be judged to do it out of any other spirit than a turbulent and evil spirit, without any true calling by the Lord, which might satisfie their Consciences: And though we <hi>should bless God,</hi> if li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty were granted more than is, and <hi>opportunities taken to teach the people,</hi> especially where there is want thereof, <hi>in the way and will of God,</hi> yet we should not rejoyce that mens particular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or such unnecessary truths, as being unseasonably delivered, would tend to division, and not to edification, should be vented, especially in such auditories, as are in the common sort of those assemblies, and most of all where there are able preachers, who constantly and rightly teach the Doctrine of the Gospel of Christ.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> 2ly, <hi>It appears not, that these</hi> Paul <hi>speaks of, were not true Gospel Ministers, and so it reacheth not the case in hand: This being that, we have proved the Ministers of</hi> England <hi>guilty of,</hi> viz. <hi>and acting in the holy things of God without any commission from Christ, which when our dissenting brethren prove they have, we shall easily acknowledge the lawfullness of attending upon their Ministry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. <hi>It follows not in the least, that these the Apostle speaks of, were either not real Saints, or not true Ministers of Christ, because they are said to preach him out of envy; the object whereof was not Christ; (for had they envyed him, they would never have preached him) but</hi> Paul, <hi>(thinking, sayes he, to add afflictions to my bonds) which is consistent with grace, and a lawfull mission to the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet,</hi> 4ly, <hi>Here is not in this Scripture the least word requiring Christians to hear them. That because</hi> Paul <hi>rejoyces at their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore 'tis the duty of Saints to attend upon their Ministry, is such a non-sequitur as will never be made good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, nor needs it, the lawfulness to hear the present Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> not <hi>the duty of the Saints to attend upon their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> being the thing in question, and therefore it is sufficient for my purpose if I prove hence the lawfulness of hearing them, though I should not prove it the Saints duty to attend on their Ministry. Which I conceive may be done by this argument. They, in whose preaching of Christ we may rejoyce, though they should not preach Christ sincerely, but in pretence out of envy, not good will, out of contention, thinking to add affliction to other Ministers bonds, may be heard by the Saints lawfully: But the Saints may rejoyce in the present Ministers of <hi>England</hi> their preaching of Christ, though they should not preach Christ sincerely, but in pretence, out of envy, not good will, out of contention, thinking to add affliction to other Ministers bonds. Therefore the Saints may hear the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>England</hi> lawfully. The <hi>major</hi> is grounded on this, that the thing we may rejoyce in is good, for which we may thank God, and consequently hear: which is agreeable to that of the Prophets, <hi>Esai.</hi> 52.7. <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.15. applyed by the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. to the preaching of the Gospel, who, he supposeth, are to be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed and heard. The <hi>minor</hi> is proved from the Apostles example, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17.18. That preaching of Christ that is no other
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:100176:184"/>
then St. <hi>Paul rejoyced in,</hi> and professed he <hi>would rejoyce in,</hi> the Saints now may rejoyce in, though it be not sincerely, but in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, out of envy, not good will, out of contention, to add affliction to other Ministers bonds; But such is the preaching Christ by the present Ministers, <hi>ergo,</hi> the Saints may rejoyce in it. The <hi>major</hi> is not to be denyed, unless it be shewed that the Apostle did evil in so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing. The <hi>minor</hi> is manifest, in that no other exception is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against their preaching, then such as with as great reason might have nullified the joy of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that, which moved him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. In a word, though personal defects and miscarriages were in the preaching of Christ, yet the thing it self being good and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioning the magnifying of Christ, it is, and should be, matter of joy to all that love Christ. To this Argument I find the Author of the Pamphlet intituled <hi>prelatical preachers none of Christs teachers,</hi> p. 45. answering thus, that <hi>preaching of Christ is not to be rejoyced in without limitation, because of these texts,</hi> Mark 1.24, 25. Luke 4.34, 35.41. Acts 16.18. Acts 15.1. Gal. 5.2, 4.12. Phil. 3.2, 3. Acts 20.29. Psal. 50.16.18. But he sets not down the limitation he would gather thence; only it may se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m by the texts, that <hi>we are not to rejoyce in the confession of Christ or his servants by the Devils, when the necessity of circumcision and keeping the law of</hi> Moses <hi>for justification is taught, when hypocrites take Gods law into their mouths by professing or declaring of it, but hate to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> Which we grant, but say all these texts, and the limitation thence deducible, are impertinent to the present argument, for as much as these do not preach Christ. <hi>Nor,</hi> saith that Author, <hi>in propriety and strictness of speech can Christ be said to be preached by a prelatical Ministry: they justifie them that deny Christ to be the sole law-giver of his Church, and so make him an Idol.</hi> Which to be false is shewed in the <hi>answer to the</hi> 5th. <hi>chapter of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</hi> Yet saith that Author, <hi>p.</hi> 46. <hi>In case such a Minister as this that preacheth by the Bishops licence should in his Doctrine or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affirm Jesus Christ to be the sole law-giver unto his Churches, yet in, and by his very act of preaching he should deny it: should the Apostle rejoyce in that preaching of Christ which is a denying him?</hi> An horrible speech of monstrous absurdity and impudent malice. I should not say so much of such preaching, though it were by the Popes licence, or the Devils instigation: For though I should not rejoyce in the motive or impulsive cause by which it is done, yet I would not so censure the thing it self as a denying of Christ. But how the receiving of a license from a Protestant Bishop to preach the Gospel within his Diocess, and preaching there by vertue of it
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100176:185"/>
according to the order established by the law of the land should be a denying of Christs legislative power, is to me incomprehensible, and to use that Authors phrasifying, <hi>the first born of absurdities.</hi> I should rejoyce, and bless God to obtain such power upon justifiable conditions.</p>
               <p>But to our Author; His First answer is not to the purpose; For rejoycing in the Ministers preaching of Christ, or those that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of envy, is not a rejoycing in the good event by evil means, but in a good event by good means, the preaching Christ is a good thing, in which the Apostle, and we rejoyce, and the effect is good, although the motive and end of the preachers be evil. The put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Christ to death was in it self evil, and not to be rejoyced in, though the effect of it be good, and to be rejoyced in, no way was the acting of <hi>Pilate,</hi> or <hi>Herod,</hi> or the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to be abetted, but to be abhorred, though the Counsel of God was to be justified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled, as was done, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Should the Pope send <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> to preach the Gospel, and they should continue to preach it, and no doctrine antievangelical, I know no reason, why the Saints might not attend on their Ministry.</p>
               <p>To the 2<hi>d.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> and 4<hi>th.</hi> Answers I reply, That the preaching of Christ in opposition to <hi>Paul</hi> makes it probable, that they were not <hi>real Saints,</hi> nor <hi>true Ministers</hi> in his sence, such motives being contrary to that brotherly love, which is in every real Saint, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. and that order of the Church by which is a lawfull mission, which me thinks he should not conceive to have been in them that acted in a way of contention against St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle of the Gentiles. And for the Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> I like better the words of Mr. <hi>Iohn Robinson</hi> in his <hi>Justification of the Separation,</hi> p. 307. then these Authors words: <hi>In the general, I confess, there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and so in that general and large sence, wherein Mr.</hi> Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard pag. 313. <hi>expounds the word sent, or Apostle, I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge many Ministers in</hi> England <hi>sent of God: that is, that it comes not to pass without the special providence, and Ordination of God, that such and such men should rise up, and preach such and such truths for the furtherance of the Salvation of Gods elect, in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they come. They which preached Christ of envy and strife to add more afflictions to the Apostles bonds, were in this respect sent of God, and therefore it was, that the Apostle joyed at their preaching. How much more they that preach of a sincere mind, though through ignorance, or infirmity, both their place and enterance into it be most unwarrantable?</hi> And sure, if they may in this sense be said to be sent of God, it follows Saints may hear them, which was to be proved.

Isa.</hi> 57. 2. <hi>may be used in the publick worship of God.</hi> 3. <hi>That the most wicked and their seed, may be compelled, and received to be members of the Church.</hi> 4. <hi>That Marriage may be forbidden at certain seasons, as in Lent, Advent, Rogation-week,</hi> &amp;c. 5. <hi>That Baptism is to be administred with a cross in the forehead, and that as a symbolical sign.</hi> 6. <hi>That though the most notorious, obstinate offenders be partakers of the Lords Supper, yet the people that joyn with them, are not defiled thereby.</hi> 7. <hi>That there may be Holy days appointed to the Virgin</hi> Mary, John Baptist, <hi>to the Apostles, all Saints and Angels; together also with Fasts on their Eves, on</hi> Ember-days, Fridays, Saturdays (<hi>so called heathenishly enough) and Lent.</hi> 8. <hi>That the Cope, Surplice, Tippit, Rocket,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are meet and decent ornaments for the worship of God, and Ministry of the Gospel.</hi> 6. <hi>That the Book of Common-prayer is the true worship of God.</hi> 10. <hi>That Christ descended into hell (as if Christ descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the place of the damned) as the Papists hold.</hi> 11. <hi>That Lord Bishops can give the holy Ghost, and power to forgive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sins.</hi> 12. <hi>That Altars, Candles, Organs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are necessary and useful in the Church of God.</hi> 13. <hi>That all children when baptized, are regenerate, and received by the Lord for his own children by adoption, Common-prayer-book of publick Baptism.

               </p>
               <p>I reply, 1. The grant, That <hi>it is lawfull to hear truth preached,</hi> is sufficient to prove it lawful to hear the present Ministers preach truth (which he denies not they do) unless he could prove it were contrary to the way of Christ's appointment to hear the truth from them. 2. All that preach some truth, are not to be heard; yet all that preach the great truths of the Gospel, notwithstanding some er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours non-fundamental may be heard, especially if the errours be seldom or never pressed on the hearers, but left to them to examine, and to be approved or disproved. Heretical Preachers are not to be heard, because they preach not the great truths of the Gospel but errours, which overthrow the foundation, so do the Popish Priests; yet it were no sin to hear either of these speak truth. The Devils we are to have no communion with, God having put an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enmity between the serpent and the seed of the woman. 3. If <hi>the present Ministers of</hi> England <hi>preach truth but by halves,</hi> it is lawful to hear them preach those halfs. The Bishops allow them to preach all truths needful to salvation, all that is contained in the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100176:186"/>
Creed, Lords Prayer, and Ten Commandments, in the 39 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the two Tomes of Homilies; nor are men inhibited in Schools, or Convocations, or at some times in books published in <hi>Latine,</hi> to discover any truths of God, so it be done without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance, or other evil consequence. That some truths needful to be known, are not permitted to be published to the vulgar audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, may have the same reason as Christ had for not acquainting his disciples with <hi>many things he had to say to them, because they could not then bear them,</hi> John 16.12. Some things may seem <hi>very clearly revealed in the Scriptures to some, and be owned by them,</hi> which are pernicious, as that <hi>the Saints have all right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that they are to smite the civil powers as part of the fourth Monarchy, that justified persons are not under the command of the moral Law</hi>; some disputable, as about the thousand years reign, That God cannot forgive sins without satisfaction to his justice, Church-constitution, Covenant, Government, and many more, which it is agreeable to the Apostles rule, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. their practice, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. not to vent in all sorts of auditories; and if the Bishops do restrain Preachers, especially those that are young, raw, injudicious, but violent, and apt to cause division, they do, agreeably to the Apostles rule, to the example of all Churches, where Government is not popular (which breeds confusion) yea I think the Separatists have found by experience some restraint ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and that the universal liberty of Conscience, or of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying, as it is termed, is intolerable; and if Bishops, who are men, and may be more rigid then they should, hold the reins in too hard, yet there is no reason why the people should refuse to hear that truth which is necessary and sufficient to salvation, because they cannot hear every truth, which perhaps out of faction, or a childish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy, or having itching ears, they desire to know.</p>
               <p>As for what is said about the <hi>Ministers contradicting their preaching by their practice,</hi> it is answered before in the <hi>Answer to the</hi> 5<hi>th Chapter.</hi> And yet were it granted, their personal evils are not sufficient to make the hearing of the truth unlawful to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. As for <hi>the errours they are said to mingle with the truths they teach,</hi> they are not such as overthrow the foundation, if they were errours, and taught by them; and therefore this is no sufficient reason why they may not be heard preaching necessary truths. Yet to shew the futility of this allegation, I shall consider each of the supposed errours. The first I doubt not they will deny, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this Authour to prove it. For the second, it is not, for ought I know, preached by any of the Ministers, <hi>That the Apocryphal
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100176:187"/>
books which have in them errours, may be used in the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God,</hi> nor do I think if they should so do, could it well consist with their subscription to the sixth <hi>Article</hi> of the <hi>Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which excludes them out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of holy Scriptures, which contain all things necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and saith, <hi>The Church (as</hi> Hierome saith) <hi>doth read them for example of life, and instructions of manners: but yet doth it not apply them to stablish any doctrine.</hi> And what Dr. <hi>Rainold,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> that now is, with many of the English Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, and conforming Divines have written about the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books, is sufficient to clear the present Ministers from suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of complying with the Papists, who according to the Decree of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council ses. quarta, <hi>put most of them</hi> (though they leave out some of them) <hi>into the Catalogue of sacred Books, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that truth and discipline of the Gospel which is saving, and to be preached to every creature, and receive and venerate them with equal affection of piety and reverence, as other books of holy scripture.</hi> And although the passages alleaged by this Authour are liable to exception, nor do I think it fit for me to justifie or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them; yet this I say, to shew there is not a sufficient reason to withdraw from hearing the present Ministers preaching or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 1. Some of the books are not appointed to be read at all. 2. Some of those that are appointed to be read, are capable of an easier censure, and better construction, then is put upon them by this Authour. 3. That those which are not so capable of excuse, yet are appointed to be read on such days, and in such places, as those that alleadge this for a reason of not hearing the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, need not be present. 4. That it was once resolved as lawful by Dr. <hi>George Abbot,</hi> after Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in his answer to Dr. <hi>Hill</hi> the Papist, <hi>p.</hi> 317. from the Preface to the second Tome of the Homilies, for the Minister, instead of the Apocryphal books, to read some other part of the Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of the old Testament.

Judas <hi>was not a visible wicked man at the time of his preaching, but so close an hypocrite, that he was not known to be so, no not to the disciples: but some of the present Ministers of</hi> England <hi>are visibly wicked and profane.</hi> 2.

               <p>I reply, It is confessed that the present Ministers are not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and called by Christ to Preach as <hi>Iudas</hi> was; and it may be also proved concerning the Ministers of the Congregational Churches, whose calling may be questionable as well as theirs, being often by a small company of ignorant persons, many of them women, who challenge power of election without Ordination, or other help, or giving the right hand of fellowship by Elders of other Churches, nor are they all free from visible wickedness and prophaness. And this may be somewhat to the business, by allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vehemency of this Authours spirit against others. But the chief use of this objection is to answer one exception of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, ch. 2. <hi>That the present Ministers are not to be heard as gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brethren, because they walk disorderly:</hi> For <hi>Iudas</hi> did walk disorderly, and yet might be heard.

apparently a thief as others that are openly vitious; yet Christ knew him to be a thief and a traitour, when he appointed him to preach, and forbade none to hear him preach the Gospel, and therefore allowed hearing of evil men preach truth, which is denyed by the Author of <hi>Prelatical preachers none of Christs teachers,</hi> p. 43, 44. and is frequently the reason of many peoples not hearing them that preach truth.

                  <note rend="inter">So are the words in the book of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> 
                  <hi>and as this Church and Realm hath received the same, according to the Commandements of God</hi>; which, for any to disclaim, is to go back from the service of Christ, and if the present Ministers <hi>do stand in this Ministry, the Saints are warranted, and engaged to attend upon it. The greater hopes we have of their goodness,</hi> the more are all, that love the Lord Jesus, bound to encourage them <hi>in this way,</hi> as being the the true way of Christ, and to <hi>relinquish them, and separate from them,</hi> for this cause is very sinfull, sith it is to separate from them for doing their duty: To hold them as excommunicate, to reprove, to urge them to repentance, not to receive them, to conceive of them as brethren walking disorderly, is uncharitableness, and injustice. That <hi>the incestuous person was a good man</hi> before he repented can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well conceived, sith he committed <hi>such a sin as was not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among the Gentiles</hi>: it was the sin of the <hi>Corinthians that they were puffed up and had not rather mourned, that he that had done that deed might be taken away from among them,</hi> it is no sin, that the Saints do not mourn, that the present Ministers, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly <hi>good men,</hi> may be taken away from among them, it is their great sin, if they do not bless God for them, and pray for their establishment and good success in their Ministry.

               <p n="1">1.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Conversion of Souls is no argument, either of a lawfull call to an Apostleship, or Ministry of Christ.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>For,</hi> 1. <hi>Many have converted Souls, that were not Apostles, as ordinary Ministers.</hi>

                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:100176:192"/>2. <hi>The Lord hath used private brethren, women, yea, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable providences, as instruments in his hand for the conversion of many Souls; yet who will say that private brethren, women, or Divine Providences, are Apostles or Ministers of the Lord Jesus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> 3. <hi>Should it be granted, that conversion of Souls is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a lawfull Ministry, where are the Churches, nay where are the particular persons converted by them? We have not heard of any, nor will it be an easie task for the Objectors to produce instances in this matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, That <hi>the Ministers of England,</hi> who preach the Gospel truely, <hi>are true Gospel Ministers, may be denied absolutely,</hi> but not justly, their preaching the Gospel truely being it, which alone is the form denominating a Minister a true Gospel Minister; though more be required to his regularity. Election by a Congregational Church, Ordination by an Eldership, or Bishop, do not make a true Gospel Minister without it, and it doth it notwithstanding some other defects. But conversion of Souls is no certain sign of a true Gospel Minister, or the defect of it an argument against it: nor do I alledge 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1, 2. to prove either. Yet when the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Christ is truly preached, and so blessed an effect follows on their labours, who do so, it is a good motive to the converted to hear them who have been instruments of their conversion, and is an engagement to them to follow their doctrine and conversation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15, 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.7.17. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.12, 13. And if this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or any other do separate from them, who have been instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their conversion, and continue still to preach the Gospel truly, because they abide in their station without renouncing Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Ordination, or accepting of an election by a congregational Church, they do it unwarrantably and injuriously. As for the words of the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1, 2. the Apostles aime is to shew he was as free, and might use his liberty as much as any other Apostle, being as truly an Apostle as any other, which might, besides other evidences, from the effect of his Apostleship on them appear to them; so that it is an argument of his Apostleship, though not singly, not, as this Author conceives, a motive <hi>to win upon their affections</hi>; yet I think it an argument from and of some thing proper to the Apostle, and the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and therefore would not meerly from conversion of Souls, conclude a true Gospel Ministry in all that have been instruments therein. As for the demand, <hi>where are the Churches, where are the particular persons converted by them?</hi> It may perhaps be as justly demanded of this Author, where are the Churches or particular persons converted by the Ministers of the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100176:192"/>
congregational Churches in old or new <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Holland</hi>? Mr. <hi>Robert Baylie</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> in his <hi>Dissuasive from the Errors of the time,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Edwards</hi> in his <hi>Gangraena</hi> tell stories of the fruit of separation, which I will not avow as true: yet so much of truth may be picked out of them, as may stop the mouths of them, that extoll those Ministers, and decry the best of the Conformists; who yet have been, if not of late, yet heretofore Fathers in Christ to the Members of the Congregational Churches, and to the most eminent in the Churches of old or new <hi>England.</hi> But this disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some, and extolling of others, is an odious course tending to nothing but promoting of faction, and weakning the hands of them that do the work of Christ, and therefore do pray that this spirit of pride and bitterness may be extinguished, than <hi>in love we may serve one another, and</hi> that <hi>nothing be done out of strife and vain-glory, but that in lowliness of mind each may esteem others better than our selves.</hi> And I wish none had vented or read such criminations as those in the book entituled <hi>Prelatical preachers none of Christs teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> in which he breaks out thus, p 61. <hi>They that were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The sole of our aim in the whole is, That Christ may be glorified in the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of any poor lamb, that is turned aside to the flocks of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in this cloudy and dark day; that others that have hitherto kept themselves from Idols, might be further established in the will of God, and strengthened to follow Christ in his temptations, that they may inherit that kingdom and glory, prepared for them before the foundation of the world: May we but in the least contribute, by Divine blessing, hereunto whatever becomes of these papers, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be by others accounted of, we have our end, and shall rest satisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, this objection I find made not onely by some of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:100176:194"/>
sort of professors, but also particulaly by Mr. <hi>Crofton,</hi> and made by him as an argument, wherefore he did, and ought to joyn in hearing and praying in publick on the Lords day, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the defects in the ministerial mode and method of the publick Ministers, the worship of God substantially existing in matter and essential form in their Ministration, and the Lords day being to be observed in publick as well as private, where, and when the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances cannot be enjoyed in a purer manner. His second in the book intituled, <hi>Jerubbaal justified,</hi> doth reduce his plea to this Syllogism. <hi>Communion with the Church visible in Gods solemn publick worship, is an essential part of the sanctification of the Sabbath, and indispensable duty. But communion with the</hi> English <hi>Church, in the worship by her celebrated, is communion with the Church visible in Gods solemn worship.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the</hi> English <hi>Church (having no opportunity with any other) in the worship of her celebrated, is to me an essential part of the sanctification of the Sabbath, and indispensable duty.</hi> This Syllogism is defended in that Book, to which I refer the Reader, and consider the objection as here it is urged and answered. The objection proceeds upon suppositions of the Separatists, or Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, in the number of whom he is to be accounted, as appears by his wordes in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> in answer to the 7th. objection, where he saith, <hi>Learned</hi> Ainsworth, Cotton, &amp;c. <hi>have been and are of the same apprehension with us in this matter.</hi> Now in Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons way of the Churches of Christ in</hi> New England, it is put into the definition of a visible Church, that they <hi>are a number that may meet every Lords day for all Ordinances,</hi> and in the <hi>Declaration of the Elders and Messengers of the Congregational Churches at the</hi> Savoy, Oct. 12. 1658. ch. 22. art. 8. <hi>The Sabbath is then kept holy to the Lord, when men are taken up the whole time in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private exercises of his worship, and in the duties of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and mercy.</hi> Among these <hi>art.</hi> 5. <hi>The reading of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, preaching and hearing of the word of God are reckoned,</hi> and <hi>art.</hi> 6. <hi>God is to be worshipped as in private families daily, and in secret each one by himself, so more solemnly in the publick assemblies, which are not carelesly nor wilfully to be neglected or forsaken, when God by his word or providence calleth thereunto.</hi> Upon which, and other suppositions, it concerns every tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which receiveth these principles, to consider how they can acquit themselves from not observing the Lords day in publick assemblies, where God is invocated in the name of Christ, and the word of God truly taught, especially in such places where they may
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:100176:194"/>
enjoy these performed by the present Ministers, and are deprived of their former Ministers and communion, and cannot of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves discharge these duties.</p>
               <p>That which this Authour answers, doth not solve the doubt: That such persons conceive they <hi>cannot spend the Lords day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing, is not out of any Idolizing the Ordinances of God</hi>; but from those grounds which are by <hi>the declaration</hi> afore named, and the generality of zealous Preacher, pressed upon Christians, That it is one duty of sanctifying the Lords day, not onely to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from labour, which makes onely <hi>Sabbatum asinorum,</hi> a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath that beasts have as well as men; nor onely to exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in reading and prayer at home, for that is every days duty; but also to frequent the publick assemblies where God is worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, which this Authour conceives injoyned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. and is gathered from <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1.2. <hi>John</hi> 20.19.26. That many persons cannot in many places find such assemblies of the Saints, as this Authour means, is a thing out of doubt with me. Were publick hearing a sin, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it were better to do nothing than do that: But that is not yet proved, and I think it fit to acquaint the Reader, That Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> in that <hi>Answer to</hi> Apollonius <hi>his questions,</hi> which is commended by Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Philip Nye,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sidrach Simpson,</hi> ch. 13. doth thus determine, <hi>Such things being observed as are to be observed, it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to use forms of prayers, administrations of Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>prescribed in the Church, neither are the Churches which use them guilty of superstition, will-worship, and violating the second Commandment; yea, it is lawful to embrace communion with them, where such forms in the publick worship are in use: neither doth it lie as a duty on a believer, that he separate and disjoyn himself from such a Church, unless he would partake in the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious worship of Images. Communion with a Church,</hi> quâ utitur, <hi>as it useth worship of it self unlawful, is unlawful; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a Church</hi> quae utitur, <hi>which useth it, to wit, in other lawful worship, is lawful; and separation from it, is unlawfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to shew how evil the counsel of this Authour is to men to spend the Lord's day in a corner idle at home, rather then go to hear in publick. I think good to subjoyn some words of Mr <hi>John Paget</hi> in his <hi>Preface to the Christian Reader,</hi> before his Book, Intituled, <hi>An Arrow against the separation of the Brownists. Of the Brownists there are sundry sorts: some separate from the Church of</hi> England <hi>for corruptions; and yet confess both it and</hi>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:100176:195"/>
Rome <hi>and it also to be a true Church, as the followers of Mr.</hi> Johnson, <hi>Christian Plea,</hi> p. 216, 217. <hi>Some renounce the Church of</hi> England <hi>as a false Church, and yet allow private communion with the godly therein, as Mr.</hi> Robinson Justifie. p. 339, 340, 247. <hi>and his followers</hi> Relig. Com. p. 1. &amp;c. <hi>Some renounce all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious communion both publique and private with any Member of that Church whosoever, as Mr.</hi> Ainsworth <hi>Counterpoy.</hi> pag. 197. <hi>and such as hearken unto him, being deepest and stiffest in their Schism. The evil of this separation is great.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, The minds of many are troubled and distracted hereby; even of such as do not separate, but have some liking thereof; especially if it be true which Mr.</hi> Robinson <hi>writes of them,</hi> Relig. comm. preface; <hi>to wit, That they seeing it not to be for their purposes that the world should so esteem of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do undoubtedly strain and wring the neck of their consciences and courses, to look the contrary way</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. <hi>What can be more miserable then to have the necks of consciences thus broken by the doctrine of separation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, for those that separate, but do not yet joyn unto them, or being joyned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do withhold from actual communion, living alone, and hearing the word of God in no Church, as some do; How great is their misery also; Mr.</hi> Robinson <hi>himself, ibid.</hi> p. 36.39. <hi>shews it at large, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing them to be Idol-members, such as break the commandment of Christ, loose the fruit of his ascension, and fail their own edification and salvation many ways,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for those that being enjoyned to them, do also live with them, seeing they have in effect excommunicate themselves from all other Churches of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently from the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Christ Jesus himself, and from the participation of his grace and glory, so far as he reveals the same by dwelling in those Churches: It is therefore no wonder to hear Mr.</hi> Johnson treat on Matt. 18. Preface A. 2. <hi>complaining of the evils among them, as emulation, debate, and other sins which daily arise and spread themselves to the great dishonour of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for the directions given by this Authour, how to spend at home the Lords day, some of them are such as weak persons; women and novices cannot make use of it, yea, they would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to them, occasioning them to fall into errours, Enthusiastick conceits, some of them Antinomians count unnecessary, and those that are good; yet by the deprivation of society, and publick teaching, and heavily performed; and they that take such courses, do either very frequently decay in the exercise of godliness, grow barren and liveless in prayer and holy conferences, or turn Seekers,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:100176:195"/>
Quakers, Ranters, Censurers, Scoffers, Libertines: However, were they all used, yet they solve not the doubt arising from those principles, which require publick hearing for hallowing the Lords day; which is to be observed not onely for the benefit of our own edification, but also for the glory of God, and testification of our profession; which is not done by private exercise of Religion. And although some persons may more benefit themselves in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by reading at home, yet the example hinders others from the use of the publick Ordinances, whereto we should by our practice encourage them. For these, and other reasons often urged by those, who have been for separation, it is not to be expected that such private exercises should be blessed or accepted of God, when the publick are to be performed. Both certainly should be done in their seasons, not one exclude the other.</p>
               <p>I have thus answered all I find in this Authour, and do joyn with him in referring the thing to the Reader, who, if he will not cheat his own soul, must judge impartially, and without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, weighing what is said on both sides. As for my aims and spirit in writing this thing, having found so little equity in mens censures of me about former writings, I can the less trust to any sort of mens good or bad of one or other opinion or judgement of me: My care I hope shall be, to approve my self to God, and to sollicite him by prayers for his blessing upon my labours in this thing: To which I shall add as over-measure, these ensuing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for hearing the present Ministers as now the case is.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>Sect. 15.</hi> An Appendix, containing fourty additional Reasons against denying the lawfulness of hearing the present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters.</head>
               <p>First I argue for the lawfulness of hearing them Preach the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel, as it is professed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the definition of sin, which is <hi>a transgression of the Law,</hi> 1 John 3.4. whence the Apostle, Rom. 4.13. <hi>Where no law is,</hi> that is, no law prohibiting that which is done, <hi>there is no transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> Whence I argue, That is lawful in which is no sin, in the hearing of the present Ministers Preach the doctrine of the Gospel, as it is professed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is no sin, therefore it is lawful. The <hi>major</hi> is undoubted, that being unlawful onely in which is sin according to the notion of the terms: The <hi>minor</hi> is proved; because it is no breach of the Law, there being neither any law of nature, nor any written law of the Old or New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, moral or positive, in express terms, or by good consequence
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:100176:196"/>
against it. Which is sufficiently proved by the answer to such Arguments as are here brought to prove a prohibition of such hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by requiring those that condemn it as unlawful, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the law which forbids it; which yet is not done that we know. If it be said (as it is by many of the people who scruple the doing of many things used in the publick worship as now it is) that in Gods worship it is not enough, that there is no law against what we do, but there must be also a command to do it, else it is will-worship. Besides what I have answered in the examination of the first Chapter of this Treatise I add 1. That the alleadging of a command is not necessary to prove a thing lawful, but to prove it a necessary duty, it is sufficient to prove my present conclusion, That no Law forbidding the hearing the present Ministers can be produced. 2. That as express command may be shewed for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the present Ministers, as for hearing the congregational Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, at least those of them that are Separatist, against whom there are more just exceptions then against the present Conforming Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> why they should not be heard: Which leads me to a second Argument for the lawfulness of hearing them; which I thus form.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Those Ministers may lawfully be heard, against the hearing of whom by no exceptions, but such as are extrinsecal to the duty of hearing, as it is a part of Gods worship. But so it is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hearing of the present Ministers: Therefore they may be heard. The duty of hearing, as it is a part of Gods worship, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in this, That we apply our selves to learn the mind of God, by which we come to know and obey him: It is extrinsecal to this, that it be delivered to us by a good or a bad man; a man in Church-covenant or not, our proper Pastour chosen by our selves, or imposed upon us; and therefore such personal exceptions against the deliverer, are extrinsecal to the duty of hearing or non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hearing, if he declare Gods mind to us, we may worship God in hearing, though the Preacher sin in his conversation, or entrance on his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, or be otherwise faulty, if he be faithful in delivering the truth of God to us: though other things make one mans teaching more desirable, or more delightful, or useful to us, yet the defect of them makes not our hearing his teaching unlawful, who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the word of God truly, because we may thereby learn Gods mind, in applying our selves whereto is his worship by hearing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is further proved in that where there are any prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:100176:196"/>
which restrain us from hearing any Teachers, it is because of their Doctrine: Which is an argument, That in hearing others that teach true Doctrine, or the truth of Gods word, we are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to hear them, and consequently the present Ministers sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to do so. The antecedent is verified by inspection of these, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24. and such other Texts as cautionate men from hearing Teachers. Whence may be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: That's not unlawful for us, from which Gods cautions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain us not; But from hearing the present Ministers supposed to teach the truth of Gods word, Gods cautions restrain us not: therefore it is not unlawful to hear them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is the character or property of one that is of God, or is a sheep of Christ, to hear Gods word, or Christs voice without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting it to some persons, John 8.47. <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods word,</hi> John 10.27. <hi>My sheep hear my voice.</hi> Whence I argue, That is not unlawful which may be a duty, and a characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical property of one that is of God or Christs sheep. But to hear the present Ministers, being supposed to teach the word of God, and the voice of Christ, may be a duty, and a characteristical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of one that is of God, or Christs sheep. Therefore it is not unlawful to hear them, being supposed to teach the word of God, and the voice of Christ.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From the same Scriptures it may be argued thus, That may be unlawful which may be a sign of one that is not of God, nor of Christs sheep; but not to hear the present Ministers, when they teach the word of God, and the voice of Christ may be a sign of one that is not of God: for Christ saith, John 8.47. <hi>Ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God,</hi> nor a sheep of Christ, who saith, John 10.26. <hi>But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.</hi> Therefore it may be unlawful not to hear the present Ministers, and consequently lawfull to hear them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To refuse to hear the word of God, though delivered by the present Ministers, is profaneness, such as is condemned in <hi>Esau. Heb.</hi> 12.16. For it is the rejecting, or neglecting of a holy thing, as it is termed by our Lord Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. therefore it may be unlawful to shun hearing them, and consequently lawful to hear them.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:100176:197"/>7. The word of God is a <hi>pearl of great price,</hi> Matt. 7.6. <hi>such as a merchant man should sell all he hath to buy,</hi> Matth. 13.46. <hi>a great treasure,</hi> v. 44. therefore to be heard and received by whomsoever held forth, and consequently it is folly and sin to shun hearing it, because of personal exceptions against the bringer, as it would be folly to refuse a treasure found in a dunghill, or a pearl brought by an unworthy person.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If the word of God preached by the present Ministers, may be effectual for that good, which is the end wherefore it is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then it may be lawfully heard from them, or rather ought to be heard according to that precept, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. <hi>Receive with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the ingraffed word, which is able to save your souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.1, 2. <hi>Desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> But the word of God preached by the present Ministers, may be thus effectual: For the efficacy of it comes not from the personal qualifications of the Preacher, but from the verity of it, it's deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from God, his promise and blessing; and however Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists have declaimed against such Ministers, and suggested to their Partisans, as if no good could be gotten by hearing them; yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath proved the contrary: and therefore they are to be heard. <hi>Finis dat mediis ordinem mensuram &amp; amabilitatem.</hi> The hearing of them is an ordinary means of hearers edification in the faith and obedience of Christ, and therefore is not unlawful, but to be made use of.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That is not unlawfull, the neglect of which may be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and reason of a mans condemnation, <hi>it is the condemnation of a person,</hi> John 3.20. <hi>that he comes not to the light.</hi> But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Ministers holding forth the light, mens not hearing them, is not coming to the light, and so much the more dangerous, if by not hearing them, they are deprived of any other to bring the light to them, as it may, and perhaps doth fall out at some times; and in some places: Therefore the neglect of hearing them may be the occasion and reason of a persons condemnation, and so a damnable sin in them that refuse to hear them, and in those that deter others from hearing them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The words of <hi>Peter, John,</hi> 6.68. <hi>Lord to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life,</hi> include in them this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, We may go to them, as to Teachers of us, who have the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:100176:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
words of eternal life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the present Ministers who teach the Gospel of Christ, have the words of eternal life: for it contains his words, and <hi>is the power of God to salvation,</hi> from the matter of it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Mighty through God to bring into captivity eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought to the obedience of Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. Therefore we may go to the present Ministers, who teach the Gospel of Christ, and hear them as our Teachers.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</hi> Whence I thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, If the word of God be to be heard as his word, and not as the word of men, then it is sufficient for right hearing, that we attend to the preaching of it, without consideration of the personal qualifications of the men that deliver it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and consequently we need not decline hearing of Preachers that deliver it, though otherwise liable to exceptions; yea, it is our duty to hear any men preach it without questioning any thing, but whether it be the word of God, and it is evil to refuse to hear it, because of our disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and prejudice against the Preachers; and accordingly it is enough to justifie the hearing of the present Ministers, that they preach the word of God, and that we hear them as teaching it. For <hi>quatenus ipsum inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>udes de omni,</hi> if we may, yea ought to hear the word of God, as Gods word, we may and ought to hear it at any time, from any person; and if we do not hear it under this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, we hear amiss, and worship not God in hearing. But the word of God is to be heard as Gods word, as is evident from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> thanksgiving that the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> so heard it, and not <hi>as the word of men,</hi> though Preached by himself, who ascribes the efficacy of it to this consideration in their hearing. Therefore it is sufficient for right hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we attend to the Preaching of Gods word, without consideration of the personal qualifications of them that deliver it; and consequently we may rightly hear the present Ministers Preaching Gods word, though without such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal qualifications as are required of them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The same is further proved by the holy Ghosts approbation of the practice of the <hi>Beraeans,</hi> neighbours to the <hi>Thessalonians, Acts</hi> 17.11, 12. <hi>These were more noble then those in Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100176:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>

But thus may Christians hear the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore may be right hearers of the present Ministers; and consequently they that do so, do lawfully hear them; and they that hear their Ministers out of other particular respects, and not in this manner, hear not rightly, nor doth their hearing edifie them in the faith of Christ, but tends to inordinate glorying in men, and to division consequent thereon.</p>

The Schism in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> did arise from the affecting of, and addicting themselves to some teachers with relinquishment, if not disclaiming of others, as appears by that which is said 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Every one of you saith I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Apollos, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I of Christ:</hi> whereupon there were <hi>among them envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and strife, and division,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. and they sorted themselves into companies severed from others, as may be gathered from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17, 18. and that about the Lords Supper, <hi>v.</hi> 21.33. Now the not hearing of the present Ministers and the separation from the Churches that hear them, and adhering only to their own teachers and Churches according to the principles of the Separatists is either the same, or very like the Schism, or division among the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> or tends to it, and hath begotten, and is like to beget the same, if not worse, effects among the Christians in <hi>England,</hi> as were in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and therefore it is to be censured to be alike evil, as the Schism among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and is reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20, 21. among the works of the flesh excluding out of the Kingdom of God. What is alledged by this Authour to justifie such separation is answered before.

And as for this Authours 12.

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100176:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from true Churches, they have Antichristian names or titles, in being called Masters, That they deny Christs Offices in submitting to, and imposing Orders or Ordinances about worship, not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ, as Church-covenant, Paedobaptism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they are false prophets, that deny them to be true Churches of Christ, who hold the faith of Christ, That some commands of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> are Rules to us Christians, That they are <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi> in their constitution, and their practice in dividing from other Churches, not submitting to their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, those who have begotten them through the Gospel, without any well setled order among themselves, that they therefore long agree not, but crumble into many small companies, and sometimes take them to be members of their Churches who dwell in remote places; so that their gathered Churches extend as far some times as a Bishops Diocess, that they ascribe the power of the keys to the whole Church, confound Governours and Governed, allow men not set apart to that function, to teach publickly, and that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if not constantly, those to take upon them to prophesie, who are no Prophets, That they scandalize their brethren, their Governours by their invectives, That they partake of the sins of others, in allowing them to usurp that power which Christ hath not committed to them, That they cast contempt upon the ways of Christ, to wit, the Prayers and Preaching of the Ministers of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; That they go to the places of false worship, as Mr. <hi>Iohn Paget</hi> in his <hi>Arrow against the Separatists</hi> proves against <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> that they cannot expect a blessing from God upon their separation, it having no promise of God, but is against the union that should be among Christians; That it is a step to Apostacy, is a forsaking of the assembly of the Saints; to refuse to hear the present Ministers, and to joyn in Prayers with them, and too much experience hath proved what backsliding, if not to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, yet to other errours of Antinomians, Familists, Quakers, Seekers, Ranters, hath been the fruit of Separation. But I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear recrimination, and touching the sore, which I rather desire may be healed, and that our breaches may be made up, and not widened, to which this Authours reasonings tend.</p>
               <p n="31">31. The grounds upon which this Authour and other Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists deny the lawfulness of hearing the present Ministers, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther false or doubtful; as, That nothing is to be done in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100176:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God, and Church-discipline, without a particular instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That onely a Congregational Church is of Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That a true Ministry cannot be in a false Church; That a prescibed form of prayer by men, is unlawful; That we may not use any thing in Gods worship, which hath been composed by Popes, or used in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with many more; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many are shewed in this answer to be false, or uncertain, and insufficient for this Authours separation, and the fallacy of them manifested in so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many other Treatises of Conformists and non-conformists extant in Print, that I need not add any more in this place.</p>
               <p n="32">32. On the other side the Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have so sufficiently proved the truth of their Ministry against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Separatists, and so firmly by wrirting and otherwise, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Popery, even the Prelates, whom the Separatists do so much cry down as Antichristian, Popish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that were not men resolved never to lay down a calumny they have once taken up, they would lay this down, and forbear pressing separation upon such exceptions, and imputations as this Authour hath gathered together in this his dung-cart, to furnish the inconsiderate, though perhaps otherwise well-minded in matters of Religion, to cast into their faces.</p>
               <p n="33">33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it be not lawful to hear the present Ministers, because they are not rightly Elected, Ordained, in and by a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church, according to Christs institution (as this Authour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives) or because they use the Common-prayer-book, are faulty in their lives, or some evil consequences, as offence of some Saints, contempts of some ways of God, by accident ensue thereupon, then it will follow that every hearer, before he hears a Minister; must 1. be able to judge of the validity of these Reasons, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can warrant his not hearing. 2. He must be able to judge every Minister or Preacher he hears, whether he be rightly thus Elected, Ordained, or qualified. 3. He must actually exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him afore he hears him. 4. He must have power either to silence or withdraw from him, if he be not so qualified, and must use that power. But 1. Such ability is not in every hearer, nor indeed is it as the estate of things in this life is, ordinarily possible it should be. 2. Then Ministers Preaching and Ministry should
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100176:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be at the will of their Auditors. For, if one may forbear hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all may upon the same reason, and so the Minister be silenced or deprived for want of hearers. 3. This would put power in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers over their Ministers, and overthrow all Church-government. 4. It would introduce greater oppression of Ministers, then either Prelats or their Canons bring upon them. 5. Even the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Congregational Churches would be in danger of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by their members, their maintenance withdrawn, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to penury and other grievances, as well as Conforning Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. Nor do I think, but that many even of them have found the bitter fruits of such popular licentiousness out of such principles of separation, as well as others. 6. Nor can there be any setled order of government in Church or civil State, if the stated Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or Magistrates according to the present Laws, though perhaps in some things unjust, yet in the main upholding truth of faith and worship, and the publick good, should be deserted or disobeyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because every hearers or subjects conscience or minde is not satisfied.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Such a plea as is made by these men, is made by Papists for their Recusancy, that the Ministers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are not rightly called, that they are in a Schism, with other the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; and then if the Plea of the Separatists be allowed, they have this advantage, That they should not be urged to hear the Ministers, nor have the penalties of Recusancy imposed on them. I say not that this reason would reach to the toleration of their Priests and Mass, but onely if such a Plea should be allowed, why the present Ministers should not be heard, the same, or the like ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies the Papists for not hearing them, and condemns the inflicting penalties for Recusancy, because, if this Authour say true, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to hear the present Ministers. The same may be said in behalf of Quakers, Seekers, profane persons, ignorant people, they are not to be required to hear the Ministers, if it be unlawfull; and so the Magistrate should sin if he command them to hear, though Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> himself in his <hi>Justification of Separation, pag.</hi> 242. as Printed in the year 1639. writes thus. <hi>That godly Magistrates are by compulsion to repress publick and notable Idolatry, as also to provide that the truth of God in his Ordinance, be taught, and published in their Dominions,</hi> I <hi>make no doubt: It may be also it is not unlawful for them by some penalty or other, to provoke their subjects universally unto hearing, for their instruction, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;

But, if we hold it unlawful to hear the truth of Gods word taught by the present Ministers, we let go our liberty of hearing, which Christ hath not debarred us of, and make our selves servants to some whom alone we might hear, to the insharing of us if they err, so as that we may not hear them who may free us: which is no small bondage to a Christian, and tends to the calling Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines or Masters, forbidden Matt. 23.8, 10 and is an artifice by which Papists and others have still held people from discerning their errours, and kept them in dependence on them, and adherence to their party: Therefore it should not be received by us.</p>

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100176:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unlawfulness of hearing the present Ministers, as it is maintained by this Authour, I suppose is manifested by the answer and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons foregoing; and that it hath the evil effects here named, is too evident, by experience, in the neglect of the publick communion in worship, and other duties of love to them with whom commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in publick worship is not held, in the doubts and opinions of not observing the present Ministers with any respect, nor paying them dues imposed by Law, in conceiving themselves the Saints, others Antichristian, with many bitter taunts, scoffs, reproaches, revilings, tales of and against them, contrary to the fruits of the spirit of God mentioned, Gal. 5.22. Therefore it is not be to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Hereto is to be added, That upon the same suppositions the opinion of denying the lawfulness of hearing the present Ministers, as it is asserted by this Authour, is an usurpation of Christs regal office, in putting a law on the consciences of men, arrogating that power which is proper to that <hi>one Lawgiver who is able to save and destroy,</hi> James 4.12. <hi>binding heavy burthens and grievous to be born, and laying them on mens shoulders,</hi> Matt. 23.4 imitating therein Pharisaical pride, and Papal dominion, and such other practises as they condemn in others. They that condemn those that permit not them to Preach, who will not use Ceremonies, are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the like Imposition, who permit not Christians to hear Preachers of the Gospel, unless they be in a Congregational Church, and be called by them; and while they charge others with adding to the word the inventions of men, are themselves guilty thereof.</p>
               <p n="38">38. Nor is it a light matter, but to be well pondered, That by this means the knowledge of the word of God is much hindred, and thereby the furthering of the kingdom of God, the coming of which we are to pray for, is neglected, such as hold the opinion of not hearing the Ministers in publick, thinking it enough if they can teach those of their society; if by conference they instill any truths into others, it is seldom without somewhat that alienates them from others, and engageth them to their own society, with diminution of love to others, if not worse dispositions and practices. Whence many remain in ignorance, profaneness, and errours, being hardned in opposition to the present Ministers; whom I deny not,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100176:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may give too much occasion by their loose walking, and negligent Preaching, in which they are not to be excused; yet is not the opinion of not hearing them while they Preach the Gospel thereby justified, but both to be blamed as guilty of hindring the good of mens souls, and Christs kingdom, and so in some sort Antichristian.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Nor are the effects of this opinion onely perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them who are without; but evil also to them within, whether Ministers or people. To Ministers, in that by the neglect of hearing them, and such esteem as is due to them for their work sake they are disheartened, and by this wrangling, opposition, disquietness they meet with, disabled in a great measure from doing that good which otherwise might be done. Yea, by this opinion, their Ministery, though they Preach the Gospel, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulled, and accounted as accursed. So the people, in that they are divided, become unpeaceable, some for not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being unnecessarily cast on the danger of the Laws, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of Estates and Liberty, in many places growing empty of fruitful knowledge, exposed to the attempts of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, who lie in wait to deceive, filled with bitterness of spirit towards others, though profuse towards those that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with them; and in a word, there is a sad breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christians of the same profession of faith, which is most contrary to the union which they should have in Christ by the same spirit; and I wish it were not true that it is fulfilled now, which was foretold 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>That men heap to themselves Teachers after their own lusts.</hi>

               <p n="40">40. The many absurdities which are consequent on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, should disswade us from entertaining it. For if it be true, That it is unlawful to hear the present Ministers, then it is not lawfull for us to invite them to Preach, or to exhort them to it, or to rejoyce in it, or to pray to God that they may, or to praise God for their Preaching: Then it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Quakerism, Ranting, Barbarism, Rudeness should be
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:100176:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
spread among the people, then they be urged to hear the publick Preachers; That Magistrates do ill to command people to go to hear them; That they countenance or maintain them, then it is good at Sermon time to stay at home idle, or to lie in an Ale-house, rather then to go to hear them; the non-preaching Readers are as tolerable as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ministers; their forbearing to Preach, is avoiding of sin; the less they Preach, and the less they are heard Preach, there is the less sin, their silencing is no evil, not they to be blamed for not Preaching; for it can be no evil for them to forbear Preaching, if it be a sin for others to hear them, they ought rather to forbear Preaching, then to draw others to sin. And yet, so wild is this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that many of them that refuse to hear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn as this Authour doth, the hearing of them, do yet except against non-preaching Ministers, blame the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters for not Preaching more frequently, and those that hinder their Preaching: Whereas, if the hearing them were unlawful, it were good counsel to perswade men not to hear their Sermons, nor to Preach them; which would introduce Irreligion, or some pernicious Errour, as the state of things now stands in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
