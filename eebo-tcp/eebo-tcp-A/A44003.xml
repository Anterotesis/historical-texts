            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Author</hi> of theſe Writings is a perſon of great Learning, great Judgment and Wiſdom, and of great Virtue and Piety. He hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten divers learned and compleat Works upon other ſubjects; but for <hi>theſe Writings</hi> here publiſhed, they were <hi>written,</hi> as were alſo many others of the like nature, <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and <hi>upon this Occaſion:</hi> 
               <q>It hath been his cuſtom for many years, every Lord's Day in the afternoon after Evening Sermon (between that and Supper-time) to employ his thoughts upon ſeveral ſubjects of Divine Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and as things came into his thoughts, ſo he put them into writing; which he did for theſe two Reaſons: <hi>1.</hi> That he might the more fix his thoughts, and keep them from diverſion and wandring. <hi>2.</hi> That they might remain, and not be loſt by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get fulneſs or other interventions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And as this was the occaſion and manner of his writing them, ſo this doubtleſs was all that
<pb facs="tcp:50399:4"/>he intended in them, unleſs moreover to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them to his Children or ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Friends in private upon occaſion: but for <hi>publiſhing them,</hi> certainly he had not the leaſt thoughts of any ſuch thing; much leſs hath he reviſed them for that purpoſe; nor ſo much as read over ſome of them ſince he wrote them; nor indeed ſo much as finiſhed ſome of them. Nay ſo far was he from any thoughts of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them, that when he was importuned but to give his conſent to the publication of them, he could not be prevailed with to do it. And therefore that they are now publiſhed, the Reader muſt know that they are publiſhed not only in their native and primogenial ſimplicity, but without ſo much as the Author's privity to it.</p>
            <p>And thus much I thought my ſelf obliged even in juſtice to the Author to acquaint the Reader with, and ingenuouſly to acknowledge, and take upon my ſelf the fault; if any thing leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and compleat, or any wiſe liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception ſhall appear in theſe Papers, ſeeing they were neither written with any intention to be publiſhed, nor reviſed by the Author, nor are publiſhed with his knowledge.</p>
            <p>But this again on the other ſide obligeth me to render ſome <hi>Account of my doing herein.</hi> I confeſs I approve not the thing in general, that is, the publication of another's Writings
<pb facs="tcp:50399:4"/>without his conſent or privity: but yet I know very well that thoſe things which in the general are for the moſt part unlawful, may yet be ſo circumstantiated in a particular caſe, as that they may become not only lawful, but very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable to be done in that caſe: and ſuch a ſpecial caſe I take this to be. And though I think my ſelf accountable to the Author chiefly, if not to him alone, for what I have done in this caſe, yet ſome account thereof I ſhall give to the Reader, ſo far at leaſt as concerneth theſe Writings, or is neceſſary for him to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with.</p>
            <p>When I firſt met with ſome of theſe Writings and obtained the peruſal of them, I thought them well worth my pains to tranſcribe: which I did partly for my own uſe; and partly, ſeeing them written in looſe and ſcattered papers, to preſerve them from that danger of periſhing, from which I conceived the Author's larger and more compleat works to be more ſafe and ſecure. And having collected a pretty conſiderable ſtock of them, I communicated ſome of them, as I ſaw occaſion to ſome friends, ſome of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of good judgment and learning, who very much commended the ſame: and ſcarce any that ſaw them, but ſaid 'twas great pity but they ſhould be printed. But beſides the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of them by all to whom I did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them, I perceived that they had a real
<pb facs="tcp:50399:5"/>effect to the good and benefit of ſome who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed them: and this experience of the good effects which they produced by my communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to a few friends in private, did further confirm my own opinion of them, that they muſt certainly do much good if publiſhed; and being made common have the ſame good influences upon many, which I found they had upon ſome of thoſe few to whom they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in private: but for the Manuſcript Copies which I had, they were not ſufficient for all thoſe fair opportunities of doing good with them, which I ſaw even among my own friends and acquaintance. Whereupon I <hi>ſolicited the Author</hi> to publiſh them, or at leaſt to give his conſent to the publication of them; but could not prevail with him for either, although I know that no motive or argument is more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with him than that of Doing Good. But when I perceived, as I thought, that the chief reaſons why he would neither publiſh them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor give his conſent to the publication of them, were ſuch as would be of no force againſt the <hi>publication of them without his privity</hi> or knowledge, I began to conſider of doing that.</p>
            <p>But before I reſolved upon it, I ſent two of the largeſt of them to a perſon, whoſe Judgment I know the Author doth much eſteem, to have his opinion of them, not letting him know either who was the Author, or who ſent them to him;
<pb facs="tcp:50399:5"/>and having received his opinion and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of them, and that he judged them like to do much good, and ſuch as would be very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to be publiſhed, I began further to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether and <hi>how they might be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed without</hi> either <hi>Wrong or Injury</hi> on the one ſide, <hi>or Offence</hi> on the other, <hi>to the Author.</hi> And for the former I reckoned that <hi>his concern</hi> in it was either <hi>in reſpect of the Diſpoſal of the Copy</hi> wherein would be no great difficulty; or more eſpecially <hi>in reſpect of the Writings to be publiſhed,</hi> if either there ſhould occurr any thing therein not fit to be made publick; or if they were not ſo well poliſhed and perfected as might be for his credit and reputation.</p>
            <p>And although this might ſeem to be provided for in ſome ſort by <hi>Concealing his Name</hi> (which truly I ſhould much rather have made known, but that I knew I muſt then venture doubly to incurr his diſpleaſure) yet I looked upon this as but a weak and inſufficient provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in as much as it is not unuſual for Learned men even from the very stile and <hi>genius</hi> of writings to diſcover the writers; an expriment whereof I had ſeen in a perſon of learning and parts, to whom upon occaſion I once ſhewed one of the writings of this Author, but purpoſely concealed who the author was, whom notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing be ſoon diſcovered from the writing it
<pb facs="tcp:50399:6"/>ſelf, telling me he knew no man that did think at that rate, but ſuch a perſon, who was the Author indeed. And the truth is, theſe Writings do not obſcurely ſpeak their author, being a moſt lively repreſentation of him, that is, of his Mind and Soul, and of that Learning, Wiſdom, Piety and Virtue, which is very eminent and conſpicuous in him; particularly that of <hi>the Great Audit,</hi> which I uſe to look upon as his very picture, wherein repreſenting the Good Steward paſſing his Account, it was impoſſible for him not to give a lively Repreſentation of himſelf; as every Character of a truly wiſe and virtuous perſon muſt needs agree with him who is really ſuch; and they who are eminently ſuch can hardly be unknown: and therefore it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ſome, even from the conſideration of the work, may diſcover the work man, beſides many other occaſions of diſcovery which may happen.</p>
            <p>But as I thought this too weak and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ſo I could not but think it altogether <hi>needleſs,</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> both the excellent Author, and theſe his pious and excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, to be made uſe of to that end; and ſhould much rather have abſtained from publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them at all, than have relyed upon ſuch a ſhift, if I had thought that they had ſtood in any need thereof. But as it was only their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>al worth and Excellence, and Uſefulneſs which
<pb facs="tcp:50399:6"/>moved me to deſire their publication, ſo I was verily perſwaded, and as well aſſured as I could be in any writings of my own, and that not upon my own opinion only, but upon the judgment of others alſo, that <hi>nothing liable to exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> doth occurr in them, or any thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that is queſtionable, which hath not other approved authors who ſay the ſame: and the truth is, the ſubject of them is ſuch as is not like to afford much matter of that nature; theſe being Moral and Practical things, whereas they are for the moſt part matters of Speculation, and of curious (I had almoſt ſaid preſumptuous) and unneceſſary, if not undeterminable Specn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which make the great ſtirrs, and are the matter and occaſions of greateſt controverſie, eſpecially among them of the Reformed Religion.</p>
            <p>And though <hi>theſe Writings</hi> never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went the laſt Hand or Pencil of the Judicious Author, and therefore, in reſpect of that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he could have given to them, be not altogether ſo compleat as otherwiſe they might have been, yet if we conſider them in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or with reſpect to the Writings which are daily publiſhed, even of learned men, and publiſhed by the Authors themſelves, theſe will be found to be ſuch as may not only very well paſs in the croud, but ſuch as are of no vulgar or common ſtrain. <hi>The Subjects</hi> of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are common Themes, but yet ſuch as are
<pb facs="tcp:50399:7"/>of moſt weight and moment in the Life of Man, and of greateſt concernment; as in Nature thoſe things, which are of greateſt uſe and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are moſt common. But <hi>the matter of his Meditations</hi> upon theſe ſubjects is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: For as he is a man that Thinks cloſely and deeply of things, not after a common rate, ſo his Writings, his moſt <hi>ex tempore</hi> Writings, have a certain Genius and Energie in them much above the common rate of Writers. And though theſe were written <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and in ſuch manner as hath been ſaid before, yet the matter of them is for the moſt part ſuch, as he had before well digeſted, and, as a Scribe inſtructed to the Kingdom of Heaven, had treaſured up in his heart, and out of this good treaſure of his heart and the abundance of it be produceth theſe good things; things which be looked upon as of greateſt concern, and moſt worth his ſerious conſideration, and had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly weighed and conſidered. And for <hi>the Stile,</hi> it is ſuitable to the Matter, Significant, Perſpicuous and Manly; his Words are Spirit and Life, and carry Evidence and Demonſtration with them, Moral and Experimental Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration: <hi>Vox non ex ore, ſed ex pectore emiſſa.</hi> And if we take theſe Writings all together, and weigh them duly and candidly, without any vain humour of critical and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick cenſeri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſneſs, we may therein no leſs
<pb facs="tcp:50399:7"/>obſerve the worth and excellence of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, eſpecially conſidering in what manner they were written, than in his more elaborate Works: and being written and publiſhed in this manner they do more evidently demonſtrate the reality of his Honeſt, Virtuous, and Pious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, than had they been deſigned to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and been publiſhed by himſelf; which perhaps may render them not leſs acceptable to ſome Readers not of the lower rank.</p>
            <p>So that conſidering the Writings themſelves I could not think that there was any thing therein, whether of matter or form, which could render the publication of them injurious or prejudicial to the Author in the leaſt in any of the reſpects afore mentioned. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding for the greater ſecurity I thought it might be fit, and but juſt to give this true and ingenuous account both of the occaſion and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his writing, and of the publication of of them without his privity or knowledge. And this I conceived might be a juſt and ſufficient means to ſecure the Author againſt all exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, as that which would wholly acquit him in the judgment of all reaſonable men, and transferr the blame, if any ſhould be, to my ſelf, which yet was no more than what I muſt have reſolved to have undergone had they been my own Writings which I had publiſhed.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:50399:8"/>
            <p>It remained therefore only to conſider how this might be done, as without Injury in other reſpects, ſo <hi>without Offence</hi> to the Worth Author. And for this, two things did not a littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And for theſe reaſons I much deſired to have prefixed his Name, or at leaſt to have let the Reader know who he is; but I know that that would certainly have been diſpleaſing to him; and therefore having made ſo bold with him in the Publication of theſe his Writings, I would not preſume further to diſcover who he is, though for ſo juſt and honest ends; but have purpoſely left out ſome paſſages which would too plainly have made him known.</p>

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50399:12"/>this Lecture is read unto us by the many caſualties and diſeaſes that put a period to the Lives of many in our own experience and obſervation, by the many warnings and monitions of Mortality that every man finds in himſelf either by the occurrences of diſeaſes and weakneſſes, and eſpecially by the declinations that are apparent in us if we attain to any conſiderable age; and the weekly Bills of Mortality in the great City, where weekly there are taken away ordinarily three hundred perſons: The Monuments and Graves in every Church and Church-yard do not only evince the truth of it, whereof no man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doubts, but do unceſſantly incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the remembrance of it.</p>
            <p>And yet it is ſtrange to ſee that this great truth, whereof in the theory no mans doubts, is <hi>little conſidered</hi> or thought upon by the moſt of man-kind: But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe monitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of Mortality, the living lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>neſs that little concerns them, as if they were not concerned in this common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man-kind, and as if the condition of Mortality only concerned them that actually die, or are under the immediate Harbingers of it, ſome deſperate or acute
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50399:13"/>diſeaſes, but concerned not them that are at preſent in health, or not under the ſtroke of a mortal ſickneſs. The <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this Inconſiderateneſs ſeem principally theſe:
<list>
                  <item>1. That men are not willing to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this unwelcom thought of their own latter End; the thought whereof is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom and troubleſom a Gueſt, that it ſeems to blaſt and diſparage all thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoyments of Senſe, that this Life affords: Whereby it comes to paſs that, as Death it ſelf is unwelcom when it draws near, ſo the thoughts and apprehenſions of it becomes as unwelcom as the thing it ſelf.</item>
                  <item>2. A vain fooliſh conceit that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the latter End is a kind of preſage and invitation of it; and upon this account I have known many ſuperſtitiouſly and fooliſhly to forbear the making of their Wills, becauſe it ſeemed to them ominous and a preſage of Death; whereas this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, though it fits and prepares: man for Death, it doth no way haſten or preſage it.</item>
                  <item>3. A great difficulty that ordinarily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends our humane condition, to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concerning our condition than what at preſent we feel and find. We are now in health, and we can hardly bring our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50399:13"/>ſelves to think that a time muſt and will come wherein we ſhall be ſick: We are now in life, and therefore we can hardly caſt our thoughts into ſuch a mould to think we ſhall die; and hence it is true, as the common Proverb is, That there is no man ſo old, but he thinks he ſhall live a year longer.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, this is the way of man-kind to put far from us the evil day and the thought of it; but this our way is <hi>our folly,</hi> and one of the greateſt occaſions of thoſe other follies that commonly attend our lives; and therefore the great <hi>means to care</hi> this folly and to make us wiſe, is wiſely to conſider our latter end. This Wiſdom appears in thoſe <hi>excellent effects</hi> it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, which are generally theſe <hi>two:</hi> 1. It teacheth us <hi>to live well.</hi> 2. It teacheth us <hi>to die eaſily.</hi> For the former of theſe, the conſideration of our latter end doth in no ſort make our lives the ſhorter, but it is a great means to make our lives the better.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a great monition and <hi>warning</hi> of us <hi>to avoid Sin,</hi> and a great means to prevent it. When I ſhall conſider that certainly I muſt die, and I know not how ſoon, why ſhould I commit thoſe things, that if they haſten not my latter end, yet
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50399:14"/>they will make it more uneaſie and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom by the reflection upon what I have done amiſs? I may die to morrow, why ſhould I commit that evil that will then be gall and bitterneſs unto me? would I do it if I were to die to morrow? why ſhould I then do it to day? perchance it may be the laſt act of my Life, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever let me not conclude ſo ill; for, for ought I know, it may be my concluding Act in this Scene of my Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a great motive and means to put us upon the beſt and moſt profitable <hi>improvement of our time.</hi> There be certain Civil and Natural actions of our lives that God Almighty hath indulged and allowed to us, and indeed commanded us with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to uſe: As the competent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of our own Natures with moderation and ſobriety; the proviſion for our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Relations, and Dependances, without covetouſneſs or anxiety; the diligent and faithful walking in our Callings, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thereof: But there are alſo other buſineſſes of greater importance, which yet are attainable without injuring our ſelves in thoſe common concerns of our Lives: namely, our knowledge of God, and of His Will; of the doctrine of our Redemption by Chriſt; our Repentance of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50399:14"/>Sins paſt; making and keeping our Peace with God; acquainting our ſelves with Him; living to His Glory; walking as in His Preſence; Praying to Him; learning to Depend upon Him; Rejoycing in Him; walking Thankful unto Him. Theſe, and ſuch like as theſe, are the great Buſineſs and End of our Lives, for which we enjoy them in this World; and theſe fit and prepare us for that which is to come: And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that our Lives are ſhort and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and that Death will ſooner or later come, puts us upon this reſolution and practice to do this our great work while it is called to day; that we loiter not away our day, and neglect our task and work while we have time and opportunity, leſt the night overtake us when we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work; to gain Oyl in our Lamps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the door be ſhut: And if men would wiſely conſider their latter Ends, they might do this great buſineſs, this one thing neceſſary, with eaſe and quietneſs; yea, and without any neglect of what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be done in order to the common ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of our Lives and Callings; it is not theſe that diſable us and rob us of our time: But the Thieves that rob us of our time, and our one thing neceſſary, are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, exceſs of pleaſures, immoderate and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50399:15"/>exceſſive cares and ſolicitouſneſs for Wealth, and Honour, and Grandeur; exceſſive eating and drinking, curioſity, idleneſs; theſe are the great conſumptives that do not only exhauſt that time that would be with infinite advantage ſpent in our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and perfecting, and finiſhing the great work and buſineſs of our lives; and then when Sickneſs come, and Death come, and God Almighty calls upon us to give up the Account of our Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, we are all in confuſion, our buſineſs is not half done, it may be not begun, and yet our Lamp is out, our day is ſpent, night hath overtaken us, and what we do is with much trouble, perplexity, and vexation; and poſſibly our Soul takes its flight before we can finiſh it: and all this would have been prevented, and remedied, by a due conſideration of our latter End; and that would have put us upon making uſe of the preſent time, and preſent opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to do our great work while it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to day, becauſe the night cometh when no man can work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Moſt certainly the wiſe conſideration of our latter End, and the employing of our ſelves, upon that Account, upon that One thing neceſſary, <hi>renders the life the most contenting and comfortable</hi> life in the World.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50399:15"/>For as a man, that is a man afore-hand in the World, hath a much more quiet life in order to externals, than he that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind-hand; ſo ſuch a man, that takes his opportunity to gain a ſtock of grace and favour with God, that hath made his peace with his Maker through Chriſt Jeſus, hath done a great part of the chief buſineſs of his Life, and is ready upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for all conditions, whereunto the Divine Providence ſhall aſſign him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of life or death, or health or ſickneſs, or poverty or riches; he is as it were afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in the buſineſs and concern of his everlaſting, and of his preſent ſtate alſo. If God lend him longer life in this World, he carries on his great buſineſs to greater degrees of perfection, with eaſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty, trouble, or perturbation: But if Almighty God cut him ſhorter, and calls him to give an account of his Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardſhip, he is ready, and his accounts are fair, and his buſineſs is not now to be gone about; <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant whom his Maſter when he comes ſhall find ſo doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As thus this Conſideration makes the Life better, ſo it <hi>makes Death eaſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By frequent conſideration of death and diſſolution, he is taught not to fear it; he is, as it were, acquainted with it afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50399:16"/>by often preparation for it. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fear of death is more terrible than death i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſelf, and by frequent conſideration thereof a man hath learned not to fear it. Ever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> Children by being accuſtomed to what was at firſt terrible to them, learn not to fear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By frequent conſideration of our lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End death becomes to be no ſurprize unto us. The great terror of death is when it ſurpriſeth a man unawares; but antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and preparation for it takes away any poſſibility of ſurprize upon him that is prepared to receive it. <hi>Bilney</hi> the Martyr was uſed, before his Martyrdom, to put his Finger in the Candle, that ſo the flames might be no novelty unto him, not ſurprize him by reaſon of unacquainted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with it; and he that often conſiders his latter end, ſeems to experiment death afore it comes, whereby he is neither ſurpriſed nor affrighted with it, when it comes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The greateſt ſting and terror of death are the paſt and unrepented Sins of the paſt life; the reflection upon theſe is that which is the ſtrength, the elixir, the venom of death it ſelf. He therefore that wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders his latter end, takes care to make his peace with God in his life time; and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50399:16"/>They true Faith and Repentance to get his Pardon ſealed; to enter into Covenant with his God, and to keep it; to husband his time in the fear of God; to obſerve His Will, and keep His Laws; to have his Conſcience clean and clear: And being thus prepared, the malignity of death is cured, and the bitterneſs of it healed, and the fear of it removed: and when a man can entertain it with ſuch an Appeal to Almighty God, as once the good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> made, in that ſickneſs which was of it ſelf mortal, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 3. <hi>Remember now, I beſeech thee O Lord, how I have walked before thee with a perfect heart,</hi> &amp;c. it makes as well the thought, as the approach of death, no terrible buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But that which, above all, makes death eaſie to ſuch a conſidering man, is this: That by the help of this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the due improvement of it, as is before ſhewn, death to ſuch a man becomes nothing elſe but a Gate unto a better life; not ſo much a diſſolution of his preſent life, as a change of it for a far more glorious, happy, and immortal life: So that though the Body dyes, the Man dyes not; for the Soul, which is indeed the Man, makes but a tranſition from her life in the Body, to a life in Heaven: no moment
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50399:17"/>intervenes between the putting off the one, to the putting on the other: And this is the great Priviledge, that the Son of God hath given us, that by His death hath ſanctified it unto us, and by His life hath conquered it, not only in Himſelf, but for us; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.57. <hi>Thanks be unto God, who hath given us the victory, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> and <hi>our Victory,</hi> that is thus given us, is this, 1. That the ſting of death is taken away, and 2. That this very death it ſelf is rendred to us a Gate and paſſage to life eternal; and upon this account it can neither hurt, nor may juſtly affright us. It is reported of the Adder that when ſhe is old, ſhe glides through ſome ſtrait paſſage and leaves her old skin in the paſſage, and thereby renews her vigour and her life. It is true, this paſſage through death is ſomewhat ſtrait, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to the Body, which, like the decayed skin of the Adder, is left by the way, and not without ſome pain and difficulty to it; but the Soul paſſeth through without any harm, and without any expence of time, and in the next moment acquires her eſtate of Immortality and Happineſs. And this is the Victory over Death, that all thoſe have, that by true Repentance and Faith are partakers of Chriſt and the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50399:17"/>benefits of His Death and Reſurrection, who hath brought Life and Immortality to light by the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And now having gone through the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of this wiſe conſideration of our latter ends, I ſhall now add ſome <hi>Cautions</hi> that are neceſſary to be annexed to this Conſideration: We are to know that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Death be thus ſubdued and rendred rather a benefit than a terrour to good men, yet,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Death is not to be wiſhed or deſired,</hi> though it be an object not to be feared; it is a thing not to be coveted, for certainly life is the greateſt temporal bleſſing in the World. It was the paſſion, not the virtue, of that excellent Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> that deſired to dye, becauſe he thought himſelf only left of the true worſhippers of God; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.4. We are all placed in this World by Almighty God, and a talent of life is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us, and we are commanded to improve it; a task is ſet every one of us in this life by the great Maſter of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Heaven and Earth, and we are required with patience, and obedience, and faithfulneſs to perform our task, and not to be weary of our work, nor wiſh our day at an end before its time. When our Lord calls us, it is our duty with courage
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50399:18"/>and chearfulneſs to obey His call; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til He calls, it is our duty, with patience and contentedneſs, to perform our task to be doing of our work. And indeed in this life our Lord hath delivered us <hi>ſeveral tasks</hi> of great importance to do; as namely, 1. To improve our graces and virtues, our Knowledge and Faith, and thoſe works of piety and goodneſs that he requires: the better and cloſer we follow that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs here, the greater will be our reward and improvement of glory hereafter: And therefore as we muſt, with all readineſs, give over our work when our Maſter calls us; ſo we muſt, with all diligence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, continue our employment out till he calls us, and with all thankfulneſs unto God entertain and rejoyce in that portion of life he lends us, becauſe we have thereby an opportunity of doing our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the more ſervice, and of improving the degrees of our own glory and happineſs. 2. And beſides the former, he hath alſo ſet us another task, namely, to ſerve our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; to give an example of virtue and goodneſs; to encourage others in the ways of virtue and goodneſs; to provide for our Families and Relations; to do all good offices of Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, Liberality, Charity to others; cheerfully and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50399:18"/>to follow our Callings and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; and infinite more as well Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Civil, Moral employments, which though of a lower importance in reſpect of our ſelves, yet are of greater uſe and moment in reſpect of others, and are as well as the former required of us, and part of the task that our great Lord requires of us, and for the ſake of which he alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows many Talents upon us to be thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in this life, and for which we muſt alſo at the end of our day give our Lord an account; and therefore for the ſake of this alſo we are to be thankful for our life, and not be deſirous to leave our poſt, our ſtation, our buſineſs, our life till our Lord call us to Himſelf in the ordinary way of His Providence, for He is the only Lord of our lives, and we are not the Lords of our own lives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Caution is this, That as the buſineſs, and employments, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of our life muſt not eſtrange us from the thoughts of death, ſo again we muſt be careful that the overmuch thought of death do not ſo much poſſeſs our thoughts as to make us forget <hi>the concerns of our life,</hi> nor neglect the buſineſſes which that portion of time is allowed us for: As, the buſineſs of fitting our Souls for Heaven, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50399:19"/>buſineſſes of our callings, relations, places ſtations: Nay the comfortable, thankful ſober enjoyments of thoſe honeſt lawful comforts of our life that God lends us, ſo as it be done with great ſobriety, moderation as in the preſence of God, and with much thankfulneſs to Him; for this is part of that very duty we owe to God for thoſe very external comforts and bleſſings we enjoy. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47. A wiſe and due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our latter ends is neither to render us a ſad, melancholy, diſconſolate people, nor to render us unfit for the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes and offices of our life, but to render us more watchful, vigilant, induſtrious, ſoberly cheerful and thankful to that God that hath been pleaſed thus to make our lives ſerviceable to Him, comfortable to us, profitable to others, and after all this to take away the bitterneſs and ſting of death through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50399:20"/>doth at length make theſe <hi>two Concluſions; viz.</hi> 1. That the true root of wiſdom, and that therefore beſt knew where it was to be found and how to be attained, is certainly none other but A mighty God, verſ. 23. <hi>God underſtandeth the way thereof and knoweth the place thereof;</hi> and 2. As he alone beſt knew it, ſo he beſt knew how to preſcribe unto mankind the means and method to attain it. <hi>To man he ſaid, to fear God that is wiſdom;</hi> that is, it is the proper and adequate wiſdom ſutable to humane nature, and to the condition of mankind: and we need not doubt but it (is) ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he, that beſt knew what was the beſt rule of wiſdom, preſcribed it to man, his beſt of viſible creatures, whom we have juſt reaſon to believe he would not deceive with a falſe or deſicient rule of wiſdom; ſince as wiſdom is the beauty and glory of man, ſo wiſdom in man ſets forth the glory, and excellency, and goodneſs of God. And conſonant to this <hi>David</hi> a wiſe King, and <hi>Solomon</hi> the wiſeſt of men, affirm the ſame truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111 10. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom, a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing have they that do his commandments.</hi> Prov. 1.7. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of knowledge, but fools deſpiſe wiſdom and inſtruction:</hi> and 9.10. <hi>The fear of the Lord
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50399:21"/>is the beginning of wiſdom, and the knowledge of the holy is underſtanding.</hi> And when the wiſe man had run all his long travel of Experiments to attain that which might be that good for the children of men, in the end of his tedious chace and purſuit, he cloſeth up all with this very ſame conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Let us hear the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole matter, Fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole duty of man;</hi> and he gives a ſhort, but effectual Reaſon of it, <hi>For God ſhall bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good, or whether it be evil.</hi> And hence it is that this wiſe man, who had the greateſt meaſure of wiſdom of any meer man ſince the creation of <hi>Adam;</hi> that had as great experience and knowledge of all things and perſons; that made it his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſearch and to enquire, not only into wiſdom, but into madneſs and folly; that had the greateſt opportunity of wealth and power to make the exacteſt enquiry therein: This wiſe, and inquiſitive, and experienced man, in all his Writings, ſtiles the man fearing God and obeying him, the only wiſe man; and the perſon that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects this duty, the only fool and mad man.</p>
            <p>And yet it is ſtrange to ſee <hi>how little
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50399:21"/>this is thought of or believed in the World:</hi> Nay, for the moſt part he is thought the wiſeſt man who hath the leaſt of this principle of Wiſdom appearing in him; that ſhakes off the fear of God, or the ſenſe of his preſence, or the obedience to his will, and the diſcipline of Conſcience; and by craft, or ſubtilty, or power, or oppreſſion, or by whatſoever method may be moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, purſues his ends of profit, or power, or pleaſure, or what elſe his own vain thoughts and the miſtaken eſtimate of the generality of men render deſirable in this World: And on the other ſide, he that governs himſelf, his life, his thoughts, words, actions, ends, and purpoſes, with the fear of Almighty God, with ſenſe and awe of his preſence, according to his word, that drives at a nobler end than ordinarily the World thinks of, namely, peace with Almighty God, and with his own Heart and Conſcience, the hope and expectation of Eternity, ſuch a man is counted a ſhallow, empty, inconſiderate, fooliſh man, one that carries no ſtroke in the World, a man laden with a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly deluſion, ſetting a great rate upon a World he ſees not, and neglecting the opportunities of the World he ſees.</p>
            <p>But upon a ſound and true Examination
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50399:22"/>of this buſineſs, we ſhall find that the man that feareth God is the wiſeſt man, and he that upon that account departs from evil is the man of greateſt underſtanding. I ſhall ſhew therefore theſe <hi>two things;</hi> 1. What it is to fear God; 2. That this fear of God is moſt demonſtratively the beſt Wiſdom of mankind, and makes a man truly and really a wiſe man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Touching the firſt of theſe, <hi>Fear</hi> is an affection of the Soul that is as much <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified</hi> as any one affection whatſoever; which diverſification of this affection ariſeth from the diverſification of thoſe objects by which this affection is moved. I ſhall mention theſe four:
<list>
                  <item>1. Fear <hi>of Deſpondency</hi> or Deſperation, which ariſeth from the fear of ſome great and important danger that is unavoidable, or at leaſt ſo apprehended; and this is not the Fear that is here commended to mankind.</item>
                  <item>2. Fear <hi>of Terrour</hi> or Affrightment, which is upon the ſenſe of ſome great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant danger, that though poſſibly it may be avoided, yet it carries with it a great probability and immediate impendency, as the fear of Mariners in a ſtorm, or a fear that befalls a man in ſome time or place of great confuſion or viſible calamity. And
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50399:22"/>this kind of fear of Almighty God is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times effectual and uſeful to bring men to Repentance after ſome great diſpleaſure of Almighty God by Sin or Apoſtacy; but this is not that fear that is here, at leaſt primarily and principally, meant, but thoſe two that follow.</item>
                  <item>3. A Fear <hi>of Reverence</hi> or Awfulneſs; and this fear is raiſed principally upon the ſenſe of ſome object full of glory, majeſty, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though poſſibly there is no cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any hurt from the perſon or thing thus feared: Thus a Subject bears a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential fear to his Prince, from the ſenſe of his majeſty and grandeur; and thus much more the majeſty and greatneſs of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God excites reverence and awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though there were no other ingredient into that fear. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Will ye not fear me ſaith the Lord, will ye not tremble at my preſence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.7. <hi>who would not fear thee, O King of Nations!</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. A Fear <hi>of Caution</hi> or Watchfulneſs. This is that which the Wiſe man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth always:</hi> And this fear of Caution is a due care and vigilancy not to diſpleaſe that perſon from whom we enjoy or hope for good; the fear of a Benefactor, or of that perſon from whom we may, upon ſome
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50399:23"/>juſt cauſe or demerit, expect an evil, as the fear of a juſt and righteous Judge. And theſe two latter kinds of fear, namely the fear of Reverence, and the fear of Caution, are thoſe that are the principal ingredients conſtituting this fear of God that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men commend to us as true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now this fear of God <hi>ariſeth from</hi> thoſe right and true apprehenſions concerning Almighty God, that do with a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturality and ſuitableneſs excite both theſe two kinds of Fear; and thoſe ſeem to be principally theſe <hi>three:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A true and deep ſenſe of the <hi>Being of God,</hi> namely, That there is a moſt excellent and perfect Being, which we call God, the only true God, the Maker of all things: But this is not enough to conſtitute this Fear, for <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there was a God, yet were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the fear of him.</item>
                  <item>2. A true and deep ſenſe, knowledge, and conſideration of the <hi>Attributes of God.</hi> And although all the attributes of God are but ſo many expreſſions and declarations of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and excellency, and therefore all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to advance and improve this fear, eſpecially of Reverence, yet there be ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, that ſeem in a more ſpecial manner
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50399:23"/>to excite and raiſe this affection of fear, as well the fear of reverence, as that of caution and vigilancy; as namely, 1. The <hi>Majeſty and Glory of God,</hi> at which the very Angels of Heaven, that are confirmed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable eſtate of happineſs, carry an inward, and expreſs an outward reverence. 2. But Majeſty and Glory without Power is not perfect, therefore the ſenſe and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the almighty <hi>Power of God</hi> is a great object of our fear: He doth whatſoever he pleaſeth, all things had their being from him, and have their dependance on him. 3. The deep knowledge of the <hi>Goodneſs of God,</hi> and that Goodneſs not only Immanent in himſelf, but Emanent and Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: and from this diffuſive and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative Goodneſs of God all things had their actual being, and from him they do enjoy it. And both theſe Goodneſſes of God, the Immanent and Emanent Goodneſſes are the nobleſt exciter of the nobleſt fear, a fear ſpringing from Love, and that love fixing upon the Immanent goodneſs of God which is altogether lovely and perfect, and alſo upon the Emanent and Communicative goodneſs of God, as he is our Benefactor; and wherever there is this love, there is this fear both of Reverence and Caution. We cannot chooſe but honour and reverence,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50399:24"/>and be careful to obſerve and pleaſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we thus love; the intrinſick nature of that which we love for its own worth and perfection binds us by a kind of natural bond or reſult to reverence and honour, and the extrinſick emanation of that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto us binds us to reverence and eſteem, and honour it as our Benefactor by a double bond, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, of Gratitude or Benevolence to him that communicates this good; ſecondly, by a bond of Prudence and ſelf-preſervation not to diſoblige him from whom we have our good and upon whom we have our dependance, leſt a diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſhould occaſion his ſubſtraction or abatement of that good from us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there is dependance, as there muſt be naturally love to that upon which is our dependance, ſo there muſt be neceſſarily a fear both of Reverence and Caution, even upon principles of ſelf-love, if there were nothing elſe to command it. 4. A deep ſenſe, knowledge and conſideration of the Divine <hi>Omniſcience.</hi> If there were all the other motives of fear imaginable, yet if this were wanting, the fear of God would be in a great meaſure abated; for what availeth reverence or caution, if he to whom it is intended do not know it? and what damage can be ſuſtained by a neglect or
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50399:24"/>omiſſion of that fear, if God Almighty now it not? The want of this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

A deep ſenſe of the <hi>Holineſs and Purity of God,</hi> which muſt needs cauſe in him an averſeneſs unto and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of whatſoever is ſinful or impure. Laſtly, the ſenſe of the <hi>Juſtice of God,</hi> not only an inherent Juſtice which is the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his nature, but a tranſient or diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive Juſtice, that will moſt certainly diſtribute rewards to obedience, obſervance, and the fear of his Name, but puniſhments to the diſobedient and thoſe that have no fear of him before their Eyes. The deep conſideration and ſenſe of theſe attributes of the Divine perfection muſt needs excite both the fear of Reverence, and the fear of Caution, or fear of offending either by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50399:25"/>commiſſion of what may diſpleaſe God, of omitting of what is pleaſing to him.</item>
                  <item>3. But although this knowledge of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God and his Attributes may juſt excite a fear both of Reverence and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet without the knowledge of ſome thing elſe that fear will be extravagant and diſorderly, and ſometimes begets Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition or ſtrange exorbitancy in this fear or in the expreſſions of it, and a want regularity of duty or obedience; if a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> know that Almighty God is juſt, and will reward obedience and puniſh diſobedience yet if he knows not what he will have done or omitted, he will indeed fear to diſpleaſe him, but he will not know how to pleaſe, or to obey him: therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the former there muſt (be) a <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Will or Law of God</hi> in things to be done or omitted. This Law of God hath a <hi>double Inſcription,</hi> 1. In <hi>Nature,</hi> and that is again <hi>twofold;</hi> firſt, the natural rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Morality and Piety written in the Heart: ſecondly, ſuch as are deduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the exerciſe of Natural reaſon and light; for even from the notion of God there do reſult certain conſequences of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Piety and Religion, as that he is to be prayed unto, to be praiſed, that he is to be imitated as far forth as is poſſible by us;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50399:25"/>therefore as he is holy, beneficent, good, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>erciful, ſo muſt we be. 2. But we have more excellent Tranſcript of the Divine Will, namely the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> which therefore a man that fears God will ſtudy and obſerve and practiſe, as being the beſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ule how to obey him. And the very fear of God ariſing upon the ſenſe of his Being and Attributes will make that man very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Many Learned men conſidering that great ſimilitude and image of ratiocination in ſome Brutes eſpecially, have therefore declined to define a Man by his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that analogical ratiocination which they find in brutes, but define a man by his <hi>Religion, Homo eſt animal religioſum;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this they find no communication or ſimilitude of natures or operations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween men and brute beaſts: for man i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the only viſible creature that expreſſeth any inclination to Religion or the ſenſe of a Deity, or any exerciſe of it. I do not ſtand to juſtifie this Opinion in all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, only thoſe things are moſt certain; 1. That only the Humane nature ſeems to have any ſenſe or impreſſion of any regulary Religion upon it: 2. That the ſenſe of a Deity and Religion reſulting from it, is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50399:26"/>the great ennobling, and advance, and perfection of the Humane nature: 3. That take away the fear of God, all ſenſe and uſe of Religion falls to the ground. So that the Fear of God is the great foundation of Religion, and conſequently the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling and advance of Humane nature, that ſeems almoſt as great a prelation of a man truly religious above an irreligious man, as to operations and uſe, as there is between an irreligious man and a brute. As Religion advanceth, ſo Irreligion em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſeth the Humane nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Juſtice</hi> is of two kinds; <hi>Distributive,</hi> which is the juſtice of a Magiſtrate or Judge diſtributing rewards and puniſhments, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and diſpleaſure, and due retribution to every man according to the merits of his cauſe. 2. <hi>Commutative,</hi> which is in all Civil contracts and dealings between per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; as dealing honeſtly, keeping promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and uſing plainneſs, ſincerity, and truth, in all a man ſayeth, or doeth: and both theſe kinds of Juſtice are effects of excellent Wiſdom; without theſe States, and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and perſons fall into diſorder, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and diſſolution: and therefore thoſe very men that have not this juſtice and righteouſneſs, yet honour and value thoſe that have it, and uſe it. And the fear of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50399:27"/>Almighty God is that which begetteth and improveth both theſe kinds of Juſtice. Hence it was that <hi>Moſes,</hi> in his choice of Judges, directs that they ſhould be <hi>men fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God and hating covetouſneſs. Jehoſaphat,</hi> in his Charge to his Judges, thought this the beſt expedient to contain them within the bounds of Juſtice, to put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance before whom, and for whom, they are to judge. And the very Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſome of them uſed to ſet an empty Chair in the place of Judicature, as an Emblem of the preſence of God, the inviſible, and yet all-ſeeing God, as preſent in the Courts of Juſtice, obſerving all the Judges do; and this they eſteemed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent means to keep Judges to their duty, by repreſenting to them the glorious God beholding them. And as thus in diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice, the fear of God is a great means to keep and improve it; ſo in commutative Juſtice, the fear of God gives a ſecret, and powerful Law to a man to keep and obſerve it. And hence it is that <hi>Joſeph</hi> could give no greater aſſurance to his Brethren, of his juſt dealing with them than this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.18. <hi>This do, for I fear God;</hi> and on the other ſide <hi>Abraham</hi> could have no greater cauſe of ſuſpition of ill and unjuſt dealing from the People with whom he converſed,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50399:27"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>han this, that they wanted the fear of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.11. <hi>Becauſe I thought the fear of God was not in this place,</hi> &amp;c. The ſenſe of the Greatneſs; and Majeſty, and Power, and Juſtice; and all-ſeeing Preſence and Command of Almighty God lays a greater obligation and engagement upon a Heart fearing God to deal juſtly and honeſtly, than all the terrours of Death it ſelf can do.</p>
            <p>And if any one ſay, How came it to paſs that the Heathen that knew not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore feared not the true God, were yet great aſſertors, maintainers and practiſers of all Civil Juſtice and Righteouſneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man? I ſay, though they knew not the true God, they knew there was a God, whom (though ignorantly) they feared: And this imperfect and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fear of God was the true cauſe of that Juſtice and Righteouſneſs that was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and not for oſtentation, practiſed among them; and though they miſtook the true God, yet in this they were not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken that there was a God; and this truth had that great prevalence upon them to do juſtly: And if that imperfect fear of God in them did ſo much prevail as to make them ſo juſt, how much more muſt the true knowledge and the fear of the true God prevail to advance Righteouſneſs and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50399:28"/>Juſtice in them that have that fear of God in their Hearts?</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a great part of Wiſdom that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns a perſon in the exerciſe of the <hi>Duties</hi> of his <hi>Relations,</hi> and indeed it is a great part of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs. Now th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fear of Almighty God hath theſe two great advantages therein. Firſt, the will of God inſtructs exactly all relations in their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theſe reciprocal relations; and this will of God is revealed in his Word, which contains excellent Precepts of all kinds, ſuitable to every ſeveral relation. Secondly, the fear of God ſets theſe Directions cloſe upon the Heart, and is a ſevere and conſtant obligation to obſerve them: And ſo this fear of God doth effectually fit, habituate, guide, and oblige a man to the Duties of his ſeveral relations: it makes a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, a good Subject; a good Husband, a good Wife; a good Father, a good Child; a good Maſter, a good Servant; in all thoſe ſeveral kinds of goodneſs that are peculiar and proper to the ſeveral relations wherein a man ſtands.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Sincerity, Uprightneſs, Integrity</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> are certainly true and real Wiſdom. Let any man obſerve it while he will, an hypocrite, or diſſembler, or double-hearted man, though he may ſhuffle it out for a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50399:28"/>while, yet at the long run, he is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and diſappointed, and betrays very much folly at the latter end; when a plain, ſincere, honeſt man holds it out to the very laſt; ſo that the Proverb is moſt true; that <hi>Honeſty is the best Policy.</hi> Now the great Priviledge of the fear of God is, that it makes the Heart ſincere and upright, and that will certainly make words and actions ſo: For he is under the ſenſe of the inſpection and animadverſion of that God that ſearches the Heart, and therefore he dares not lye; nor diſſemble, not flatter, not prevaricate, becauſe he knows the pure, all-ſeeing, righteous God, that loves truth and integrity, and hates lying and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, beholds and ſees and obſerves him, and knows his thoughts, words and actions. It is true, that vain-glory, and oſtentation, and reputation, and deſigns, and ends may many times render the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions ſpecious and fair, when the Heart runs quite another way, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly would frame the actions, if thoſe ends and deſigns and vain-glory and oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation were not in the way; but the fear of God begins with the Heart, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>fies and rectifies it; and from the Heart thus rectified grows a conformity in the life, the words, the actions.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:50399:29"/>
            <p n="5">5. The great Occaſion and <hi>Reaſon of the Folly of mankind</hi> are, 1. The unrulineſs and want of government of the <hi>ſenſual appetite</hi> on <hi>Luſts:</hi> hence grows intemperance and exceſs in eating and drinking, unlawful and exorbitant luſts; and theſe exhauſt the Eſtate, waſte and conſume the Health, embaſe and impoveriſh the Mind, deſtroy the Reputation, and render men unfit for Induſtry and Buſineſs. 2. The exorbitancy, and unrulineſs, and irregularity of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; as exceſſive love of things that are either not lovely, or not deſerving ſo much love; exceſs of anger, which oftentimes degenerate into malice and revenge; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of joy in light, trivial, inconſiderable matters; exceſs of fear, where either no cauſe of fear, or not cauſe of ſo much fear is: And theſe exorbitances of Paſſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the ſuccours of Reaſon, break out into very fooliſh, vain, imprudent actions, and fill the World with much of that folly and diſorder that is every where obſervable. 3. Theſe diſeaſes and diſtempers of the Mind, as pride, vain-glory, ambition of honour and place, and power, inſolency, arrogancy, envy, covetouſneſs and the like, theſe I ſay are ſo many Sickneſſes and Cankers and rotten Ulcers in the Mind; and as they, like the Furies that were let looſe out of <hi>Pandora</hi>'s
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50399:29"/>Box, do raiſe moſt of thoſe ſtorms and tempeſts that are abroad in the World, ſo they diſeaſe and diſorder and beſet the Mind wherein they are, and make their lives a torment to themſelves, and put them upon very fooliſh, vain and frentique actions and deportments, and render men perfect fools, mad men, and without underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and their folly is ſo much the greater and the more uncurable, that like ſome kind of frentique men they think very goodly of themſelves, think themſelves paſſing wiſe men, and applaud themſelves; though it is moſt apparent to any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by-ſtander, that there are not a ſort of vainer fooliſh perſons under Heaven. Now as we are truly told that the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and ſtep of wiſdom is to put off folly,
<q>
                  <l>—Sapientia prima eſt,</l>
                  <l>Stultitia caruiſſe—</l>
               </q>
ſo it is the method of the fear of God, the beginning of all true wiſdom, to disburthen a man of theſe originals and foundations of folly: It gives a law to the Senſitive appetite, brings it in ſubjection, keeps it within the limits and bounds of Reaſon, and of thoſe inſtructions and directions that the wiſe God hath preſcribed; it keeps it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50399:30"/>under diſcipline and rule: It directs the Paſſions to their proper objects, and keeps them within their due meaſures, and with in the due lines and limits of moderation, and as becomes a man that lives in the ſight and obſervation of the God of glory, majeſty, and holineſs: It cures thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and diſtempers of the Mind by the preſence of this great preſervative and cathartick, the Fear of God. If <hi>Pride</hi> or <hi>Vain-glory</hi> begins to bud in the Soul, he conſiders that the God he fears reſiſts the proud: this fear puts a man in remembrance of the glorious Majeſty of the moſt glorious God; and what is a poor Worm, that he ſhould be proud or vain-glorious in the preſence and ſight of that mighty God? If <hi>Ambition</hi> or <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> begin to appear, this fear of God preſently remembers a man that the mighty God hath prohibited them, that he hath preſented unto us things of greater moment for our deſires than worldly wealth, or honour; that we are all of his houſhold, and muſt content our ſelves with that portion he allots us, without preſſing beyond the meaſure of ſobriety or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon or ſubmiſſion unto him: If <hi>Revenge</hi> ſtir in our Hearts, this fear of God checks it, tells a man that he uſurps God's prerogative, who hath reſerved vengeance

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t by remembring us that the Mighty God prohibits it, that he is the Sovereign Lord and diſpenſer of all things: if he hath given me little, I ought to be contented; if he hath given another more, yet why ſhould my Eye be evil becauſe his Eye is good? Thus the fear of the Lord walks through the Soul, and pulls up thoſe weeds and roots of bitterneſs and folly that infect, diſquiet, diſorder, and befool it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another great cauſe of folly in the World is <hi>Inadvertence, Inconſiderateneſs, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy,</hi> and over-haſtineſs in ſpeeches or actions. If men had but the patience many times to pauſe but ſo long in actions and ſpeeches of moment as might ſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat but the Creed or Lord's Prayer, many follies in the World would be avoided that do very much miſchief both to the parties themſelves and others: And therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertence and precipitancy in things of great moment, and that require much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, muſt needs be a very great folly, becauſe the conſequence of miſcarriage in them is of greater moment. Now the fear of the Lord of Heaven and Earth, being actually preſent upon the Soul, and exerting
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50399:31"/>it ſelf, is the greateſt motive and obligation in the World to conſideration and attention touching things to be done or ſaid. When a man is to do any thing or ſpeak in the preſence of a great earthly Prince, the very awe and fear of that Prince will give any man very much conſideration touching what he ſaith or doth; eſpecially to ſee that it be conformable to thoſe Laws and Edicts that this Prince hath made. Now the great God of Heaven and Earth hath, in his Holy Word, given us Laws and Rules touching our words and actions; and what we are to ſay or do is to be ſaid and done in no leſs a preſence than the preſence of the ever-glorious God, who ſtrictly eyes and obſerves every man in the World, with the very ſame advertence as if there were nothing elſe for him to obſerve: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there cannot be imagined a greater engagement to advertence, and attention, and conſideration than this: And therefore if the action or ſpeech be of any moment, a man that fears God will conſider, 1. Is this lawful to be done or not? if it be not, how ſhall I do this great evil and ſin againſt God? 2. But if it be lawful, yet is it fit, is it convenient, is it ſeaſonable? if not, then I will not do it, for it becomes not that Preſence before whom I live. 3. Again,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50399:31"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onſider how it is to be done, what are the moſt ſuitable circumſtances to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and good pleaſure of that great God before whom I ſtand. And this advertence and conſideration doth not only qualifie my actions and words with wiſdom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in contemplation of the duty I owe to God, but it gives an excellent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity very many times, by giving pauſe and deliberation in reference to my duty to God, to diſcover many humane ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients of wiſdom and prudence requiſite to the choice of actions and words, and the manner of doing them: So that beſides that greater advantage of conſideration and advertence, in relation to Almighty God, it doth ſuperadd this advantage alſo for opportunity thereby of humane prudential conſiderations, which otherwiſe by haſte and precipitance in actions or words would be loſt; and it habituates the mind to a temper of caution, and advertence, and conſideration in matters as well of ſmaller as of greater moment, and ſo make a wiſe, attentive, and conſiderate man.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It mightily advanceth and <hi>improveth the worth and excellency of moſt Humane actions</hi> in the World, and makes them a nobler kind of thing than otherwiſe without it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50399:32"/>they would be. Take a man that is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as a Stateſman or Politician, though he have much wiſdom and prudence, in commonly degenerates into craft and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and pitiful ſhuffling, without the fear of God: but mingle the fear of Almighty God with that kind of wiſdom, it renders it noble, and generous, and ſtaid, and honeſt, and ſtable. Again, take a man that is much acquainted with the ſubtiler kind of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Philoſophy; for inſtance, without the fear of God upon his Heart, it will carry him over to pride, arrogance, ſelf-conceit, curioſity, preſumption: but min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle it with the fear of God, it will ennoble that knowledge, carry it up to the honour and glory of that God that is the Author of Nature, to the admiration of his Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs; it will keep him humble, modeſt, ſober, and yet rather with an advance than detriment to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Take a man induſtrious in his Calling, without the fear of God with it, he becomes a drudge to worldly ends, vexed when diſappointed, overjoyed in ſucceſs: mingle but the fear of God with it, it will not abate his induſtry, but ſweeten it; if he proſper, he is thankful to God that gives him power to get wealth; if he miſcarry, he is patient under the will and diſpenſation
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50399:32"/>of the God he fears; it turns the very em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of his Calling into a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duty and exerciſe of his Religion without damage or detriment to it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The fear of God is certainly the greateſt wiſdom, becauſe <hi>it renders the mind full of tranquility and evenneſs in all ſtates and conditions:</hi> for he looks up to the great Lord of the Heavens and Earth, conſiders what he commands and requires, remembers that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſurely every man muſt needs agree, that ſuch a man is a wiſer man, than he who is ever changed and tranſported with his condition; that if he be rich or powerful, there is nothing more vain, proud, inſolent than he; and

            <p n="11">11. But yet further; certainly it is one of the greateſt evidences of Wiſdom to <hi>provide for the future,</hi> and to provide for thoſe things for the future, that are of greateſt moment, importance and uſe. Upon this account the Wiſe man, <hi>Prov. 30. 25.</hi> admires the wiſdom of the Ant, that little creature, that yet provides his meat in the Summer: and we eſteem it the folly of Children and Prodigals in this, that they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50399:34"/>have no proſpect for the future how they ſhall ſubſiſt hereafter. Now the wiſdom of a man that feareth God diſcovereth it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf in this, that it provides and lays up a good and ſafe ſtore for the future, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n reſpect of theſe <hi>three kinds of futurities;</hi>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. For the future part of his life: 2. For the future evil days: 3. For the future life that is to take place after this preſent ſhort uncertain and tranſitory life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of <hi>the future time of his life.</hi> It is true, our lives in this world are but ſhort at beſt, and together with that ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they are very uncertain. But yet the man fearing God makes a due and ſafe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for that future portion of his life, how ſhort or how long ſoever it be. I. By a conſtant walking in the fear of God he tranſmits unto the future part of his life a <hi>quiet, ſerene, and fair Conſcience,</hi> and avoids thoſe evil fruits and conſequences which a ſinful life produceth, even in the after time of a man's life. The bruiſes and hurts we receive in youth are many times more painful in age, than when we firſt received them. Our lives are like the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's ſeed-time; if we ſow evil ſeeds in the time of our yourh, it may be they may lye five, ten or more years before they come up to a full crop, and poſſibly then we
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50399:35"/>taſte the fruit of theſe evil ways in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet mind or conſcience, or ſome other ſowre effects of that evil ſeed. All this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience a man fearing God prevents and inſtead thereof reaps a pleaſing and comfortable fruit of his walk in the fear of God, namely, a quiet Conſcience and an even, ſetled, peaceable Soul. 2. But beſides this, by this means he keeps his <hi>Intereſt in and Peace with Almighty God,</hi> and makes ſure of the beſt Friend in the world for the after time of his life, to whom he is ſure to have acceſs at all times and upon all occaſions with comfort and acceptance; for it is an infallible truth, That God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty never forſakes any that forſake not him firſt.</p>
            <p>The Second futurity is <hi>the future Evil day</hi> which will moſt certainly overtake every man, either the day of feeble and decrepit age, or the day of ſickneſs, or the day of death; and againſt all thoſe the true fear of God makes a ſafe and excellent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion: ſo that although he may not avoid them, he may have a comfortable paſſage through them; and in the midſt of all theſe black clouds, the witneſs of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience fearing God, and the evidence of the divine favour will ſhine into the Soul like a bright Sun with comfort, when a man
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50399:35"/>ſhall be able with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa.38.3. to appeal to Almighty God, <hi>Remember now O Lord I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and in uprightneſs of heart, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ave done that which was good in thy ſight:</hi> this will be a cordial under the faintneſs of old age, a relief under the pains of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and cure of the fear of death it ſelf, which to ſuch a Soul will be only a gate and paſſage to a life that will be free from all pains and infirmities, a life of glory and immortality.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third futurity is <hi>the Life and State after Death.</hi> Moſt certain it is that ſuch a ſtate there will be, and that it is but of two kinds, a ſtate of everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or a ſtate of everlaſting mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ry; and that all men in the World do moſt certainly belong to one of theſe two ſtates or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: and as it is moſt juſt and equal, ſo it is moſt true, that they that truly fear God, and obey him through Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be partakers of that everlaſting ſtate of bleſſedneſs and immortal happineſs: And on the other ſide, they that reject the the fear of God, contemn and diſobey his will, ſhall, without true repentance, be ſubject to a ſtate of everlaſting miſery. Now herein the trueſt and the greateſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſdom of a man appears, that <hi>he</hi> duly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50399:36"/>provides againſt the latter, and to obtain the former; all other wiſdom of men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to get humane Learning, Wealth, Honour, Power, all wiſdom of Stateſmen and Politicians, in compariſon of this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is but vain and trivial. And this is the wiſdom that the fear of God teacheth and bringeth with it into the Soul; 1. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides againſt the greateſt of evils, the everlaſting ſtate of miſery and infelicity and eternal death: 2. It provides for and attains an everlaſting eſtate of bleſſedneſs and happineſs, of reſt and peace, of glory and immortality, and eternal life; a ſtate of that happineſs and glory that exceeds expreſſion and apprehenſion, for <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor car heard, neither hath it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of man the things that God hath laid up for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. and they only truly love God, that truly fear him; <hi>Mal. 3.13. And they</hi> (namely, that fear God) <hi>ſhall be mine, ſaith the Lord, in that day when I make up my jewels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now for <hi>the Concluſion</hi> of this whole matter, let us now make a ſhort <hi>Compariſon between the perſons that fear not God, and thoſe that truly fear him;</hi> and then let any man judge who is the fool, and who is the wiſe man. A man hath but a very ſhort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain time in this life, which, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50399:36"/>of eternity, is leſs than a moment. The great God of Heaven in his Word aſſures (us) that there is an eſtate of Immortality after this life, and that that immortal eſtate is but of two kinds, an eſtate of never-dying miſery, or an eſtate of endleſs glory; and tells them, If you fear me, and obey thoſe eaſie Commands, that are contained in the Book of the Holy Scriptures, which I have given you, you ſhall infallibly attain everlaſting life and happineſs, and, even in this preſent life, ſhall have the influence and preſence of my favour to ſupport, to direct and bleſs you: On the other ſide, if ye refuſe my fear, and reject my commands, and prefer the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and vain deluſions of this preſent life, before the obedience of my will, and perſiſt impenitently in it, your portion ſhall be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery. And now everlaſting life and everlaſting death being ſet before the children of men, there are a ſort of men, that rather chooſe to diſobey the command of God, reject his fear, and all this, that they may enjoy the pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon, thoſe pleaſures that are fading and dying, that leave behind them a ſting, that renders their very enjoyment bitter, and that make even that very little life they enjoy, but a life of diſcomfort and unhappineſs in ſpight of all their pleaſures, or be they as ſincere as their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50399:37"/>own hearts can promiſe them, yet they are but for a ſeaſon, a ſeaſon that in its longeſt period is but ſhort, but is uncertain alſo, a little inconſiderable accident, the breath of a vain ... an ill air, a little ill digeſted por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that exceſs wherein they delight, may put a period to all thoſe pleaſures, and to that life, in a year, in a week, in a day, in an hour, in an unthought of moment, before a man hath opportunity to conſider, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think himſelf, or to repent; and then the door of life and happineſs is ſhut. Again, there are a ſort of men that conſider this great Propoſal, and chooſe the Fear of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and with it Eternal Life, and are content to deny themſelves in things unlawful, to obey Almighty God, to keep his favour, to walk humbly with him, to accept of the tender of Life and Salvation, upon the terms propounded by Almighty God: And in the practice of this Fear they enjoy His favour, and preſence, and love; and after this life ſpent, whether it be long or ſhort, and whether their death be lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring or ſudden, are ſure the next moment after death to enjoy an immortal life of glory and happineſs. Judge then which of theſe is the truly Wiſe man, whether this be not a Truth beyond diſpute: <hi>The Fear of God that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>JOB</hi>'s Friends, though in the particular Caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> they were miſtaken, yet they were certainly very wiſe, godly, and obſerving men; and many of their Sentences were full of excellent and uſeful Truths, and particularly this Speech
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50399:38"/>of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> which importeth theſe two uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Propoſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>the general ſtate of man in this world is a ſtate of Trouble and Affiiction;</hi> and it is ſo common to him, ſo incident to all degrees and conditions of mankind, that it ſeems almoſt as univerſal, as that natural propenſion in the ſparks to fly upward: No perſon of whatſoever age, ſex, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, degree, quality, profeſſion, but hath a part in this common ſtate of mankind; and although ſome ſeem to have a greater portion of it than others, ſome ſeem to have greater and longer viciſſitudes and intermiſſions and allays thereof than others, yet none are totally exempt from it: yea it is rare to find any man, that hath had the ordinary extent of the age of man, but his troubles, croſſes, calamities, afflictions have overweighed and exceeded the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his comforts and contentments in this life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That yet <hi>thoſe Afflictions</hi> and Troubles do neither grow up by a certain, regular and conſtant courſe of Nature, as Plants and Vegetables do, out of the ground, neither are they meerly accidental and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual; but they <hi>are ſent, diſpoſed, directed, and managed</hi> by the conduct and guidance of the moſt wiſe Providence of <hi>Almighty
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50399:38"/>God:</hi> and this he proveth in the ſequel of this Chapter. And as in all things in Nature the moſt wiſe God doth nothing at random, or at a venture, ſo in this part of his providential diſpenſation towards mankind, he doth exerciſe the ſame, with excellent wiſdom, and <hi>for excellent Ends;</hi> even for the very good and advantage of mankind in general, and particularly of thoſe very perſons that ſeem moſt to ſuffer and be afflicted by them: ſometimes to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, ſometimes to correct, ſometimes to prevent, ſometimes to heal, ſometimes to prepare, ſometimes to humble, always to inſtruct, and teach, and better the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if there were no other end but theſe that follow, <hi>this ſeeming ſharp Providence of Almighty God</hi> would be <hi>highly juſtified:</hi> namely, firſt, to keep men humble and diſciplinable. Man is a proud vain creature; and were that humor conſtantly fed with proſperity and ſucceſs, it would ſtrangely puſt up this vain humor: Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and troubles are the excellent and neceſſary correctives of it, and prick this ſwelling impoſtumation of pride and haughtineſs, which would otherwiſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men intollerable in themſelves and one to another. Secondly, to bring mankind
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50399:39"/>to recognize Almighty God, to ſeek unto him, to depend upon him: This is the moſt natural and ſpecifical effect of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, <hi>Hoſ. 5.15. In their afflictions they will ſeek me early; Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſſon, That their Happineſs lyes not in this World, but in a better; and by this means, even by the croſſes and vexations and troubles of this World, and by theſe plain and feaſible documents to carry man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind up to the end of their beings. God knows thoſe few and little comforts of this life, notwithſtanding all the troubles and croſſes with which they are interlarded, are apt to keep the hearts, even of good men, in too great love of this World. What would become of us, if our whole lives here ſhould be altogether proſperous and contenting, without the intermixture of croſſes and afflictions? But of theſe things more hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now ſince the ſtate of mankind in this World is for the moſt part thus cloudy and ſtormy, and that ordinarily we can expect it to be no otherwiſe, there are theſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations</hi> which become every wiſe and good mind to acquaint himſelf with.</p>

               <item>1. What Preparation is fitteſt to be made by every man before they come.</item>
               <item>2. How they are to be received and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and improved, when they come, and while they are incumbent.</item>
               <item>3. What is the beſt and ſafeſt temper of mind when any of them are removed.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Touching the firſt of theſe, namely, <hi>Preparation</hi> before they come; and the beſt preparatives ſeem to be theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A right and ſound conviction and <hi>conſideration</hi> of this moſt certain experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal truth, namely, That <hi>no man</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, how good, juſt, pious, wiſe ſoever can by any means expect to be <hi>exempt</hi> from them, but muſt be more or leſs ſubject to Affliction, of one kind or other, at one time or another, in one meaſure or another; for man is certainly born to trouble, as the ſparks ſly upward: And this certain truth will be evident, if we conſider <hi>the ſeveral kinds</hi> of affliction that are common to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and herein I ſhall forbear the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which concern our childhood and youth, as ſuch, which yet notwithſtanding are ſubject to afflictions, that though they ſeem not ſuch to men of riper years, yet are as real and pungent, and deeply and ſenſibly grievous to them, as thoſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50399:40"/>that ſeem of greater moment to men of riper years: But I ſhall apply my ſelf to thoſe Inſtances which are more evident, and of which thoſe that have the exerciſe of their reaſon may be more capable.</p>
            <p>Afflictions ſeem to be of <hi>two kinds,</hi> 1. Such as are common calamities, befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a Nation, City, or Society of men: 2. Or more perſonal, that concern a man in his particular.</p>
            <p>Touching the former of theſe, namely, <hi>common calamities,</hi> ſuch are Wars, Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, Famines, Peſtilences, ſpreading contagious Epidemical Diſeaſes, great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagrations, experience tells us, and daily lets us ſee that they <hi>involve</hi> in their extent the generality of men, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> juſt and unjuſt, pious and profane: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the gracious God is ſometimes pleaſed, for ends beſt known to himſelf, ſtrangely to preſerve and reſcue as it were, ſome out of a common calamity, yet it is that which I do not know how any man can promiſe himſelf, though otherwiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo pious and juſt, becauſe I find not that any where under the Evangelical diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation God Almighty hath promiſed to any perſon any ſuch immunity; and common experience ſhews us that good and bad are oftentimes involved in the effects and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50399:40"/>of the ſame common calamity: and indeed it would be little leſs than a Miracle, and ſomewhat above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of the Almighty's regiment of things, to give particular exemption in ſuch caſes. If a man receive any ſuch bleſſing from God, he is bound eminently to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it as a ſignal, if not miraculous intervention of the divine mercy; but it is not that which a man can reaſonably expect, becauſe, although upon great and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous occaſions Almighty God is pleaſed not only to give out Miracles, but even to promiſe them alſo, as in the juſtifying of the truth of the Goſpel, in the firſt publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof, yet it is not equal for any particular perſon to ſuppoſe, that for the preſervation of a particular intereſt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, God Almighty ſhould be as it were engaged to put forth a Miracle, or little leſs than a Miracle; and <hi>the Reaſons hereof are:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe under the <hi>Evangelical diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> the rewards of goodneſs, piety, and obedience are of another kind, and of a greater moment, namely, Eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and not exemption from temporal calamities; if Almighty God grant ſuch an exemption, it is of bounty and abundance, not of promiſe. It is true, under <hi>the Old
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50399:41"/>Covenant with the people of</hi> Iſrael, their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were in a great meaſure of temporal benefits, and the Adminiſtration of that Church, as it was in a great meaſure ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, ſo the Divine Adminiſtration over them was very uſually miraculous, both in their bleſſings, preſervations and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions: And there was ſpecial reaſon for it; for they were to be a monument to all Mankind, and alſo to future Ages, of a ſpecial and ſignal Divine Regiment; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the obedient might upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Divine Promiſe expect bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and deliverances, even in publick calamities that might befall the People in general: But we have no warrant to carry over thoſe promiſes of Temporal benefits and exemptions to the obedience under the Goſpel, which as it is founded upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Covenant, ſo is it furniſhed with better Promiſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>the best of men</hi> in this life, <hi>have ſins and failings</hi> enow, to juſtifie the Juſtice of Almighty God, in expoſing them to temporal calamities; and yet his mercy, goodneſs and bounty (is) abundantly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in reſerving a reward in Heaven far beyond the merit of their beſt obedience and dutifulneſs: So that though they are expoſed to temporal calamities, Almighty
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50399:41"/>God ſtill remains not only a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but a liberal and bountiful Lord unto them in their everlaſting rewards. What are light afflictions and but for a moment in compariſon to an eternal weight of glory? <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.17. Rom. 8.18.</note> And the latter is the reward of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience under the Goſpel, whiles the former may be poſſibly the puniſhment or at leaſt correction for their Sins.</p>
            <p>And therefore, although at the interceſſion of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Lord was pleaſed to grant a relaxation of the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> for the ſake of ten Righteous, it was an act of his bounty; and ſo it was when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family: Yet he had not been unjuſt if he had ſwept them away in that common temporal calamity, becauſe poſſibly the ſins of <hi>Lot</hi> himſelf might have been ſuch, as might have acquitted the juſtice of God in ſo doing: for the higheſt temporal calamity is not diſproportionate to any one Sin: And although he were pleaſed in mercy to ſpare <hi>Lot</hi> and his two Daughters, yet neither was he wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from that great calamity, for his Houſe, Goods and the reſt of his Family periſhed in that terrible Conflagration.</p>
            <p>And upon this conſideration, we have juſt cauſe to <hi>blame two ſorts of perſons;</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:50399:42"/>namely, 1. The raſh cenſure of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate perſons, that are too ready to cenſure all ſuch as fall under a common calamity, whether of Fire, Sword, or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence; as if ſo be they were therefore greater ſinners than thoſe that eſcape: the errour reproved by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the inſtance of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lu. 13.1, 2.v. Joſ. 9.2, 3.</note> and thoſe upon whom the Tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fell. 2. The miſtaken apprehenſion of men concerning themſelves, that upon an opinion of their own righteouſneſs or deſert, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves exempted from the ſtroke of common calamities, or are ready to accuſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, if they are not delivered from them. If they truly conſidered the juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of any ſin, and their own ſins or failings, they would both acknowledge the Juſtice and Goodneſs of God, if he reſerve an eternal reward of their obedience, though he expoſe them to the worſt of temporal evils.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning <hi>Perſonal Evils,</hi> they are of ſeveral kinds; 1. ſuch as befall the Body, 2. ſuch as befall the Eſtate, 3. ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the Name, 4. ſuch as befall a man's Friends or Relations.</p>
            <p>Touching the firſt of theſe Evils, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that befall the <hi>Body,</hi> they are of two
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50399:42"/>kinds; 1. Some that are not ſo Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or univerſal upon all men; ſuch as are caſualties or accidental hurts, diſeaſes ſpringing from the particular complexion or temperament of perſons, ſuch as are hereditary diſeaſes, diſeaſes incident to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ages, infectious diſeaſes ariſing from contagion, putrefaction, ill diſpoſition of the Air or Waters. 2. Some diſeaſes are incident unto every man in the World. If a man lives to a great old age, his very age is a diſeaſe, and the decay of natural heat and moiſture doth in time bring the oldeſt man to his end; but if he live not to the attainment of old age, moſt certainly as he meets with death in the concluſion, ſo he meets with ſome diſeaſe or other that makes way for his diſſolution. So that upon the whole account, though this or that man may not meet with this or that particular diſeaſe, caſualty or diſtemper, that it may be attaques another, yet as ſure as he is mortal, ſo ſure ſhall ſome diſeaſe, diſtemper, caſualty or weakneſs meet with him that ſhall bring him to the duſt of death. That perſon therefore that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the univerſal Edict and Law of death, is and muſt be ſubject ſooner or later to thoſe diſeaſes, ſickneſſes, caſualties or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that muſt uſher in his death and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50399:43"/>diſſolution. And although one man may eſcape a chronical diſeaſe, another an acute diſeaſe; one man may eſcape a Contagion, another a Conſumption; one man may eſcape this diſeaſe or caſualty, another that, yet moſt certain it is that every man ſhall infallibly meet with ſome diſeaſe, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or caſualty that ſhall be ſufficient to diſſolve his compoſition, and put a period to his life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning afflictions that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concern a man in his <hi>Estate.</hi> It is very true that ſome are more afflicted in this kind than others. The more wealth any man hath, the more he is obnoxious to loſſes; and the more any man loves wealth, the deeper the affliction of this nature wounds (him:) And this is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally true in all worldly matters what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; the more a man's heart is ſet upon it, the deeper and the more bitter the croſs or affliction is therein. But though afflictions in this kind pinch ſome cloſer than others, yet there are very few that totally eſcape in this kind. The poor man reckons it his affliction that he wants wealth; and the rich man is not without his affliction either in the loſs of it, or the fear of ſuch loſſes; which create as real a trouble as the loſs it ſelf: Fire and shipwrack, envy
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50399:43"/>and oppreſſion, falſe accuſations, robbers, a prodigal Heir. or a falſe Friend, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſuch like avenues there are to a rich man's Treaſure; and either they do actually attach it, and then they cauſe ſorrow; or they do continually menace it, and ſo they cauſe fear. Nay ſometimes a rich man hath as great an affliction in his not knowing where or how to diſpoſe of his Wealth, as he hath that wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Touching affliction in the <hi>Name:</hi> Moſt certainly of all things in the World, a good name is moſt eaſily expoſed to the injury of any perſon; a falſe accuſation, or falſe report, an action or word miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted. A man hath no ſecurity of his Wealth againſt invaſions of other; but he hath much leſs ſecurity touching his Name, becauſe it is in the keeping of others, more than of the man himſelf; and it is viſible to every man's experience, that he that hath the greateſt name is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the envy, and therefore to the detraction and calumnies of others; and he that values his name and reputation moſt, is eaſieſt blaſted and deeper wounded, by a calumny though really falſe, than he that hath little reputation, or that eſteems it lightly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Touching <hi>Friends:</hi> There are two
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50399:44"/>things that induce the loſs of friends: 1. That which ſeems caſual, yet very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, whereby either friends become ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or at leaſt grow into neglect; which is ſometimes done by miſrepreſentations, falſe reports, by prevalence of factions, by differences in matters of intereſt, by the declination of a man's condition. 2. That which is certain: Death takes away a man's friends and relations from him, or him from them; the more friends and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations any man hath, the more loſſes of them or in them (he) ſhall neceſſarily have, upon this account: becauſe every one of them is ſubject to all thoſe caſualties, that any one of them is ſubject to, whether in eſtate, name, body, or (death,) and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the more friends and relations, the more croſſes, and calamities; for all the croſſes or loſſes that befall any of my friends are communicated to me, and in a manner made mine: and the greater my number of friends and relations are, the more loſſes of them and in them I am ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to; for every one of them is ſubject to the ſame calamities with my ſelf, which become in effect mine by participation. So that the more friends and relations I have, and the dearer and nearer they are, the more croſſes I have, by participating theirs:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50399:44"/>and every bitter Arrow that wounds any of them, glanceth upon me, and makes my wounds the more by how much the more friends and relations I have; and makes them the deeper, by how much the nearer or dearer thoſe friends or relations are to me. It is true, that in a multitude of good and dear friends and relations there is a communication of more comforts; but ſince generally the Scene of every man's life is fuller of croſſes than comforts, the troubles and afflictions of my many friends or relations out-ballance and over-weigh thoſe comforts.</p>
            <p>And theſe croſſes and afflictions in body, eſtate, name, and friends, though poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they may not all come together, or in their perfection, at one time, upon any one man; yet as no man is exempt from any of them at any time by any ſpecial priviledge, ſo ſometimes they have ſaln in together in their perfection, even upon ſome of the beſt men that we read of: Witneſs that great and ſignal Example of <hi>Job,</hi> who at one time ſuffered the loſs of all his Children, of all his Servants, of all his Goods, of his great and honourable eſteem among men, of his health; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, all this lay under ſevere afflictions in his mind, and under the imputation of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50399:45"/>an Hypocrite with his beſt and judicious friends.</p>
            <p>Upon all this that hath bin ſaid, a man may, and upon evident reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, ought to conclude, <hi>That even the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And <hi>this Conſideration alone</hi> is <hi>ſufficient,</hi> 1.

This was the uneharitable and indeed unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able errour of <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, of old, and of many at this time in reference both to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and perſonal viſitations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond good Preparative againſt Affliction is a frequent practical <hi>ſupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſition,</hi> where with we are to entertain our ſelves, even in the time of our greateſt Proſperity, <hi>That the Caſe may, and probably will be altered with us;</hi> and ſo to caſt our ſelves as it were into the mold of an afflicted condition. For inſtance, I am now in health; what if I were now to enter into the valley of the ſhadow of death, into ſome acute, or pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or deſperate diſeaſe; how am I ſitted with patience, reſignation of my ſelf into the hand of God, contempt of the World; for ſuch an eſtate (as) this I muſt come to ſooner or later; how ſhall I bear or carry my ſelf in it, or under it, were it now upon me? I have now a plentiful Eſtate, external affluence; what if at this moment, I were bereft of all; either by Fire or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predation,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50399:46"/>how were my mind fitted with humility and patience to ſubmit to a poor, ſtrait, wanting condition: I have now a good Husband, Wife, Children, many Friends that eſteem me and are faithful to to me; what if God ſhould in a moment deprive me of all theſe? what if my deareſt Friends ſhould become my bittereſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, how ſhould I bear my ſelf under theſe changes? I have a great Name and Eſteem in the World; what if in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a black cloud of Infamy and Scorn and Reproach were drawn of it, and that I ſhould become a ſcorn and reproach, with <hi>Job 30.8.</hi> among children of fools: yea children of baſe men viler than the earth: how were I fitted with humility and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind to comport with ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, till it pleaſeth God by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the manifeſtation of my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, if he think ſit, to ſcatter this black cloud of Calumny and Reproach, or if not, yet quietly under it to enjoy the teſtimony of a good conſcience and my own integrity. Theſe and the like anticipations of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and afflicted conditions, would habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate and fit our minds to bear them, furniſh us with ſuitable tempers for them, render them caſie to us when they come, and keep our Souls in a due ſtate of moderation
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50399:46"/>and watchfulneſs before they come: As the good Martyr <hi>Bilney</hi> before his martyrdom, by often putting his Finger into the Candle, made the Flames which he was after to endure more familiar and tollerable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Preparative againſt Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and calamitous ſeaſons, is to <hi>reaſon our ſelves off from over-much love and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World,</hi> and the beſt things it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords. <hi>Philoſophy</hi> hath made ſome ſhort eſſay in this buſineſs, but the Doctrine of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath given us far more noble and effectual topicks and arguments, than any Philoſophy ever did or can: 1. By giving us a plain and clear eſtimate and valuation of this World and all that ſeems moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable in it; but this is not all, but 2. by ſhewing us plainly and clearly a more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, certain and durable eſtate after death, and a way of attaining (it) with much more eaſe and contentation, than we can attain the moſt ſplendid temporals of this World. Certain it is that the weight and and ſtreſs of afflictions and croſſes lyes not ſo much in the things themſelves which we ſuffer in them or by them, as in that overvaluation that we put upon thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which afflictions or croſſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of. When news was brought to that noble <hi>Roman</hi> of the death of his Son,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50399:47"/>it was a great pitch of patience that even that Moral conſideration wrought in him, <hi>Novi me genuiſſe mortalem;</hi> though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, it was not without a mixture of Stoical vain-glory. We ſet too great a value upon our health, our wealth, our reputation; and that makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> unable to bear, with that evenneſs and contentedneſs of mind, the loſs of them, by ſickneſs, poverty, reproach. We ſet too great a rate upon our temporal life here, becauſe we ſet too great a rate upon this World, to the enjoyment whereof this life here is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated and proportioned; and that makes us fear death, not only as the ruine of our nature, but as that which puts a period to all our comforts: Whereas had we but Faith enough to believe the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical truths touching our future happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it would make us not deſire death, becauſe we might in the time of this life ſecure unto our ſelves that great and one thing neceſſary; and it would make us not to fear death, becauſe we ſee a greater fruition to be enjoyed after it, than all the glory of this preſent World can yield.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next Preparative againſt Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions is to keep <hi>Piety, Innocence,</hi> and a <hi>Good Conſcience</hi> before it comes. As Sin is the ſting of death, ſo it is the ſting of affliction;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50399:47"/>and that which indeed gives the greateſt bitterneſs and ſtrength unto affliction: and the reaſon is this, becauſe it weakens and diſables that part in man, which muſt bear and ſupport it. This is that which the Wiſe man obſerves, <hi>Proc. 18.14. The ſpirit of a man will ſustain his infirmities, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> which is no more than this; It is the mind and ſpirit of man rightly principled, that doth bear and carry a man through thoſe difficulties and afflictions and infirmities, under which he is; but if that ſpirit or mind which ſhould carry and bear thoſe evils, be hurt or wounded, or faint or infirm, what is there left in a man to bear that which indeed (ſhould be) our ſupport? Innocence and a Good Conſcience keeps the mind and ſpirit of a man in courage and conſidence: and indeed it hath an influence and ſuffrage and atteſtation and ſupport from the God of Heaven, to whom a good conſcience can with an humble confidence appeal as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did under a great affliction, <hi>Iſa. 38.</hi> and this acceſs to Almighty God doth give new ſupplies, ſuccours and ſtrength to the Soul to bear it up under very great and preſſing afflictions. But on the other ſide, Sin doth diſable the Soul to bear affliction till it be throughly repented of; 1. Becauſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50399:48"/>it doth in a great meaſure, emaſculate and weaken the ſpirit of a man, makes it poor, cowardly and unable to bear it ſelf up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preſſure of afflictions. 2. It doth in a great meaſure obſtruct the intercourſe between God and the Soul, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence that might and would otherwiſe be derived to the ſpirit or mind of a man by the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh.</p>
            <p>Therefore the beſt preparative againſt affliction is, <hi>to have the Soul as clear as may be</hi> from the guilt of Sin: 1. <hi>By an innocent and watchful life</hi> in the time of our proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, before affliction attach us: 2. Or at leaſt, <hi>By a ſpeedy, ſincere and hearty Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> for Sin committed; and this repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be ſpeedy, before affliction come: For although it is true that many times affliction is the meſſenger of God to awaken a ſinner to repentance, and that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is accepted by the merciful God, yet that repentance is moſt kindly and eaſie, and renders afflictions leſs difficult and troubleſom, which prevents affliction, and performs one great end and uſe of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions before it comes. He that hath a Soul cleanſed by Faith and Repentance from the guilt of Sin, before the ſeverity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction comes upon him, hath but one work to do, namely, to fit himſelf with patience
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50399:48"/>to undergo the ſhock of affliction: But he that defers his repentance, till driven to it by affliction, his work is more difficult, becauſe it is double, namely, to begin his repentance, and to bear his affliction.</p>
            <p>And becauſe in many things we offend all, and the beſt have their failings and ſins of daily incurſion, <hi>a daily reviſing and examining of our own failings,</hi> and renewing of our repentance for our daily faults is of ſingular uſe to render afflictions eaſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe repentance cleanſeth the Soul, and renders a man in God's acceptation as if he had not offended.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The next preparative againſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to gain <hi>an humble Mind.</hi> When affliction meets with a proud heart, full of opinion of its own worth and goodneſs, there ariſeth more trouble, and tumult, and diſorder, and diſcompoſure in the conteſt of ſuch a heart againſt the affliction, than poſſibly can ariſe from the affliction it ſelf; and the ſtrugling of that diſtemper of pride with the affliction, galls and intangles the mind more than the ſevereſt affliction, and renders a man very unfit for it and unable to bear it. <note place="margin">Iſa. 51.20.</note> The Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, her Sons at the head of every ſtreet were like a wild Bull in a net. But on the other ſide, an humble,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50399:49"/>lowly mind is calm and patient, and falls with eaſe upon an afflicted condition; for the truth is, the great evil of ſuffering is not ſo much in the thing a man ſuffers, as in the mind and temper of ſpirit of the man that meets with it; an humble mind is a mind rightly prepared with the greateſt facility to receive the ſhock of any affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for ſuch a mind is already as low as affliction can ordinarily ſet it.</p>
            <p>And certainly, if any man conſider aright, he hath many <hi>important cauſes to keep his Mind always humble;</hi> 1. In reſpect of Almighty God, the great and glorious King of Heaven and Earth, whom if a man contemplate, he will put his mouth in the duſt, acknowledge himſelf to be but a poor worm, and therefore unworthy to diſpute the Divine diſpenſations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences or permiſſions 2. In reſpect of himſelf. He that conſiders aright himſelf, his ſins and failings and corruptions, will have cauſe enough to humble himſelf, and reckon that he is juſtly obnoxious to the ſevereſt croſſes and afflictions. <hi>Why doth the living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſin?</hi>

For 1. it is a moſt ſovereign will; for his will muſt be done whether we will or not: therefore it is the higheſt piece of folly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to conteſt with him, that will not, cannot, may not be controlled. It is true we have commiſſion to pray to him, to deliver us from evil, but when we have ſo done, we muſt withal deſire that his will may be done; this pattern the Son of God hath given us, <hi>Matth. 26.39.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50399:50"/>of the moſt wiſe God. 3. As it is a moſt wiſe will, ſo the will of God is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt benificent and beſt will; what reaſon haſt thou to ſuſpect the beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of his will, whoſe will alone gave thee thy being, that he might communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his goodneſs to that being of thine, which he freely gave thee. It is true, it may be thou doſt not ſee the reaſon, the end, the uſe of his Diſpenſations, yet be content with an implicit ſubmiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign thy ſelf up to his diſpoſal, and reſt aſſured it ſhall be beſt for thee, though thou yet canſt not underſtand what it means. If he hath given thee an Heart to reſign up this will unto his, be confident he will never miſlead thee, nor give thee cauſe to repent of truſting him.

            <p n="7">7. I ſhall conclude with that great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative, which is indeed the completion of all that is before ſaid, and in a few words includes all, Labour to get thy <hi>Peace with God,</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: when this is once attained, thou art ſet above the love of the World, and the fear of afflictions, becauſe thou haſt the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a greater Treaſure than this World can give or take away; <note place="margin">Heb. 12.28.</note> a Kingdom that cannot be (ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,) a hope and moſt aſſured expectation that is above the region of afflictions, and that renders the greateſt and foreſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as they are, namely light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany: And yet becauſe thou art not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this glorious expectation, yet in this lower region, and ſubject to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and perturbations, and fears, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God hath engaged his promiſe to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50399:51"/>ſupport thee here under them, to better and improve thee by them, to carry thee through (them) by his all-ſufficient grace and mercy: The ſtrokes thou receiveſt are either managed and directed, or at leaſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and ordered by him that is thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that in very love and faithfulneſs doth correct thee, <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.75.</note> that hath a heart of compaſſion and love to thee, even when he ſeems in his Providences to frown upon thee; that while thou art under them, will make them work together for thy good, and that will never take from thee thoſe everlaſting mercies which are thy portion; that hath all thy afflictions, croſſes, troubles, whatever they are or may be, under the infallible conduct of his own wiſdom and power: And that as on the one ſide he will never ſuffer thee to be afflicted beyond what he gives thee grace to bear and improve; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13.</note> ſo on the other hand he will ſo manage, order and govern thy light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, which are here but for a moment, that in the end they ſhall be a means to bring thee a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.17.</note> If therefore thou wouldſt be ſoundly armed againſt afflictions, and prepared with eaſe and comfort to bear them, this one
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50399:51"/>thing neceſſary is ſufficient to render thee ſuch, and to fit thee alſo with all thoſe advantageous helps before mentioned, which will neceſſarily follow upon this attainment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, I come to the ſecond ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, namely, <hi>How Afflictions incumbent</hi> upon us <hi>are to be received, entertained and improved;</hi> and this will be in a great meaſure ſupplied by what hath been before ſaid touching our preparation of heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come: for a mind ſo prepared and habituated, will be ſufficiently qualified to receive and entertain them as becomes a good man and a good Chriſtian. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſome things I ſhall ſubjoyn in order to the bearing and improving of afflictions while they are incumbent upon us; and they are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. It becomes a man under afflictions in the firſt place to have a very diligent, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, attentive and right conſideration concerning Almighty God, that he is a God of infinite wiſdom, power, juſtice, mercy and goodneſs: That he hates not any thing that he hath made, but hath a great love and benificence to all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that he deſigns their good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, even in thoſe diſpenſations that ſeem moſt ſharp and ſevere: that if he had not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50399:52"/>a good will to his Creatures, he would never have done ſo much for them as he hath done: that whiles he exerciſeth diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to the children of men, it is evident they are under his care: that oftentimes there is a greater ſeverity of the Divine diſpleaſure, in his leaving mankind to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than in exerciſing them with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: and that he equally diſcovers the love and care of a Father in his corrections, as (well as) in his more pleaſing admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And farther, that afflictions riſe not out of the duſt, but are ſent and managed by the wiſe diſpoſition and regiment of Almighty God: it is his Providence that ſends them, that meaſures out their kind, weight, continuance; and that they are always, as commiſſionated by him, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of his power, wiſdom and goodneſs, and never exceed the line and limits of his power, wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: if he bids them go, they go; if he bids them return, they return; if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the moſt tumultuous and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous ſtorms of afflictions, peace, be ſtill, there will be a calm: as mankind is never out of the reach of his power to afflict and correct, ſo it is never out of the reach of his power to relieve and recover.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:50399:52"/>
            <p n="3">3. That as no man hath an exemption from afflictions, ſo it is moſt evident that even the beſt of men are viſited with them, and it is but need they ſhould; for where one man is the worſe by afflictions, a thouſand are the worſe for want of them, and as many the better by them; and the wiſe and gracious God that knows our frame, better than we our ſelves, doth for the moſt part in very faithfulneſs afflict us. The egreſſes of the Divine Counſels have ever in them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of excellent ends, even in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions themſelves: they are acts of Juſtice oftentimes to puniſh, and of Mercy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent diſtempers and to heal them; and this is that lot which our Bleſſed Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed unto his own People, <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> Joh. 16.33. ſo that a good man may have as great cauſe to ſuſpect his own integrity in the abſence of them, as in the ſuffering under them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That all the Divine diſpenſations of comforts or croſſes are ſo far beneficial or hurtful as they are received and uſed: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, if they make us thankful, ſober, faithful, they become bleſſings; if they make us proud, inſolent, ſecure, forgetful, they become judgments: afflictions, if they are received with humility, patience, repentance and returning to God, they are
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50399:53"/>bleſſings; if they are received with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, impatience, imcorrigibleneſs, they become judgments, and a forerunner of greater ſeverity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The conſequences of all theſe Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations do evidently lead us unto theſe <hi>Dutics,</hi> when-ever we are <hi>under the preſſure of Affliction:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To receive it with all <hi>Humility,</hi> as reached out unto us from the hand, or permiſſion at leaſt, of Almighty God. There were a ſort of Philoſophers that thought it a virtue to put on a reſolved contempt of all croſſes and afflictions; not to be moved at all with them, but to bear them with a ſtout <hi>apathy:</hi> this is not that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that becomes a Chriſtian; it is all one, as if a Child ſhould reſolve to receive the correction [of his Father] with a ſtubborn reſolution not to care for them, or to be affected with them: ſuch a ſtubbornneſs under affliction renders it unuſeful to its end, and commonly provokes the great Lord and Father of Spirits totally to reject ſuch a mind, or to maſter it with ſharper and ſeverer and multiplied afflictions, till it yield, and till that uncircumciſed Heart be humbled and accept of the puniſhment of its iniquity. <hi>Levit. 26.41.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. To receive (it) <hi>with Patience</hi> and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50399:53"/>ſubjection of mind; and without either conteſting with Almighty God, charging his Providence with errour or injuſtice, or ſwelling and ſtorming againſt the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, or the Divine diſpenſation that ſends it: This hath two ſingular beneſits; firſt, it renders the affliction it ſelf more eaſie and tollerable; ſecondly, it is one of the readieſt ways to ſhorten or abate it: For as yielding and humble ſubmiſſion to the hand of God, ſo patience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of will to the Divine diſpenſation are two of the great ends and buſineſs of affliction, which when attained by it, it hath performed a great part of its errand for which it was ſent.</item>
                  <item>3. To <hi>return unto God</hi> that afflicteth or permitteth it: Affliction miſſeth its end and uſe when it drives a man from his God, either to evil or unlawful means, or to ſhift and hide himſelf, or keep at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from him; and as it loſeth its end ſo it is contrary to its natural effect, at leaſt where it meets with a nature of any underſtanding or ingenuity. <hi>In their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> God Almighty ſends afflictions like meſſengers to call home wandring Souls; and if a man will ſhiſt away, get farther off and eſtrange himſelf more from him that ſtrikes him, he will
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50399:54"/>either ſend more importunate meſſengers, afflictions of a greater magnitude, to call and fetch him, as want and famine did the young Prodigal in the Goſpel; or, which is far worſe, let him go without farther ſeeking him: Whereas the man that by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as it were at the firſt call, comes home to God, or gets nearer to him, for the moſt part prevents ſeverer monitors, and renders his ſuffering more ſhort, or at leaſt more eaſie, by drawing near to God the fountain of peace and deliverance.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And if the affliction befalls ſuch a man that hath not eſtranged himſelf from Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, nor departed from him in any greater offences or backſlidings, yet affliction is not without its end or uſe, even to ſuch a man. Thou haſt walked cloſely in the duties towards God, haſt depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon him, approved thy ſelf in his ſight; yet is it not poſſible that for thy ſaith, induſtry, obedience, dependence may be more, more conſtant, more firm? If it may be, as ſure it may be, then though affliction ſolicit not thy return to him from whom thou haſt not departed, yet it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licits thy improvement.</p>
            <list>
               <item>4. To <hi>Pray unto God:</hi> and this is the moſt natural effect of affliction, eſpecially if it be ſevere and eminent. In the ſtorm
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50399:54"/>the Sailers call every one upon his God; and the reaſon is, becauſe in ſuch a ſeaſon, a man's own ſhifts, the help and advice and aſſiſtance of friends, and other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane confidence appear too weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual; and therefore the man is driven to that which indeed is the <hi>unum magnum;</hi> namely, invocat on of Almighty God, for help, ſupport and comfort. It is therefore a ſign of a deſperate mind that will not come unto God in prayer, at leaſt when afflictions grind him. And although a man be not of the number of thoſe that reſtrain prayer before God, yet afflictions naturally will make the prayer of ſuch a man more earneſt, fervent, conſtant; it ſets an edge and adds life to the prayers of a praying man.</item>
               <item>5. To <hi>Depend and Truſt upon God,</hi> both for ſupport under, and ſeaſonable delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from afflictions. Keep thy recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence upon his goodneſs and mercy, even under the blackeſt night of afflictions: Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him: and with <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 23.4.) even in the valley of the ſhadow of death to reſt upon his Rod and his Staff: And though it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the beſt of men to have an yielding and a ſoft ſpirit under the afflicting hand of God, yet be careful to bear up thy ſelf
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50399:55"/>under the power and goodneſs of God from fainting and deſpondence.</item>
               <item>6. To be <hi>Thankful unto God</hi> under af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and that upon very great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant motives: 1. Thankful that they are no worſe or greater: Thou haſt loſſes, but yet haſt thou loſt all at once? <hi>Job</hi> did; or if thou haſt loſt all externals, yet haſt thou not ſomething thou valueſt more than all, namely, innocence, peace with God and thy own Conſcience? 2. Thankful that God Almighty rather chooſeth to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict thee, than to forſake thee. As long as Almighty God is pleaſed to afflict thee it is plain thou art under his diſcipline, his care; no man's condition is deſperate ſo long as the Phyſician continues his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration: nor is any man wholly forſaken of God, nor paſt his care, ſo long as he is under affliction: for it is a medicine that without thy own default will either reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or better thee. 3. Thankful that God hath been pleaſed to diſcover ſo much of his mind and deſign and affections towards mankind in his Word, as to aſſure us that the meaſure of his love towards or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt the children of men, is not to be taken by external proſperity or adverſity: But on the contrary to bear up our Souls under the preſſures of afflictions,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50399:55"/>aſſures us that they are the effects for the moſt part of his fatherly love and care (rather) than of his heavy diſpleaſure; that they may indeed ſometimes be ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of his anger, but not of his hatred; they may be for corrections, but not for confuſion: he may correct thoſe, whom yet he accounts his Children and reſolves to ſave.</item>
               <item>7. To put us upon a due ſearch and <hi>Examination of our Hearts and Ways.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is not (the) beſt man living, but upon a ſtrict and impartial ſearch of himſelf may find ſewel for affliction; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit enough to deſerve it; ſomewhat amiſs that requires amendment; ſome corruptions growing into exorbitancy; ſome errours, that ſtand in need of Phyſick to cleanſe them; ſome budding diſorders, that ſtand in need of a medicine to prevent them. It is the great buſineſs of affliction, the great meſſage that it brings from God to man, is to ſearch out and ſee what is amiſs, what is defective; and to ranſack our Souls and Hearts and Lives, and ſearch whether there be not ſomething offenſive to God.</item>
               <item>8. To put a man to a <hi>double Duty</hi> upon this ſearch; namely, if upon an impartial ſerutiny, thou find thy Conſcience clear from great and waſting Sins, humbly bleſs

               </gap>mities, which although they perchance
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50399:57"/>ſee not, yet the all-knowing God ſees, and in mercy and with wiſdom prevents, by the corroſives and catharticks of affliction: infomuch that even that good man, when Almighty God opened his ear to diſcipline, ſaw and acknowledged, and therefore ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred lumſelf in duſt and aſhes. 2. As it is extremely unjuſt, ſo it is extremely fooliſh and vain: For as it is not the way to remove the affliction, ſo when God is pleaſed to remove it in mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, it makes a man juſtly aſhamed upon his deliverance, of that folly and pettiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he ſhewed under his affliction againſt Almighty God, who even then had thoughts of mercy and deliverance for him. And this very Conſideration had been enough to have made <hi>Job's</hi> deliverance yet full of trouble and ſhame, for his fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs in his affliction, unleſs the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God in a ſtrange condeſcention of goodneſs and gentleneſs had prevented it, by giving ſo great a ſuffrage unto his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and covering the errours and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate excurſions of his affliction, as a Father doth the errours and follies of his Child, by an indulgent commendation: <hi>Ye have not ſpoken of me the thing that is right, is my ſervant Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus far of the carriage that becomes
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50399:58"/>us to have under affliction, and our due im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it, to the ends for which Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God ſends it: by which <hi>Almighty God</hi> receives the honour of his ſovereignty, his juſtice, his goodneſs, his wiſdom, his truth; and man receives the benefit of prevention from ſin, deliverance out of it, improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his graces, perfecting of his Soul, and advancement of his glory, through the mercy of God, and his bleſſing upon this bitter cup, the cup of affliction.</p>
            <p>I come to <hi>the third General Conſideration,</hi> namely, that temper and diſpoſition of mind that becomes us to have upon and <hi>after deliverance</hi> from afflictions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon our deliverance from affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, we ought in a ſpecial and ſolemn manner to return our humble and hearty <hi>Thanks</hi> to Almighty God, to acknowledge him to be the Author of it, to return unto him our humble and ſerious praiſes, that he hath been pleaſed to anſwer our Prayer, and hath given us a plain teſtimony that he hath a regard to us: this is the Tribute that he expects moſt juſtly from us. As he in a ſpecial manner requires our Prayers unto him, when we are under affliction, ſo he requires that we ſhould take notice of the Returns of our Prayers, and to pay him the tribute of Praiſe upon our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50399:58"/>Call upon me in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me. The truth is, when we are under extremities, we are eaſily perſwaded to call to God for deliverance; the very natural preſſure of afflictions drive us to him, we know not whither elſe to fly: But as ſoon as the Rod is gone, we are dull and backward in returning glory to God; and we are moſt apt to take notice of the means that immediately went before. If we or any of our relations are delivered from ſickneſs, we have it preſently upon our tongues ends, that we had a careful or skilful Phyſician, a ſtrong conſtitution, favourable weather, ſome lucky accident that happened unto us; and the like we are apt to do upon other deliverance: and rarely, or at leaſt not with that ſincerity, acknowledge the mercy of God, and the hand of God to be that which raiſed us up. It is true, means are not to be neglected, it is a preſumption and tempting of God: but it is the providence of God that gives us means, and the bleſſing of God that makes them ſucceſsful, that ſometimes bleſſeth poor and weak and unlikely means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce deſired effects; ſometimes maketh thoſe very things we call accidents, that ſeem to import the very deſtruction of a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50399:59"/>man, to be the means of his recovery, and ſometimes brings about the effect without any viſible means. We are no leſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his goodneſs and influence, when we ſeem to be delivered by means, than if we were delivered by miracle. It is true, we are apt to faſten our thoughts and reaſons upon means, becauſe we ſee them; but if our Eyes could be ſo opened as the Prophet's ſervant's were, <note place="margin">2 Kings 6.17.</note> when he ſaw the Chariots of fire in the Mountain, we ſhould ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of regiment and government and ordering and diſpoſing of things than now we ſee. Many, if not moſt, of thoſe ſignal deliverances that a Man or a Nation hath, are wrought not ſo much by the efficacy of means, as by a ſecret inviſible Hand of Providential government which we ſee (not.) If therefore thou art delivered from any great diſtreſs of any kind, in ſuch a manner that thou canſt not attribute it to means, or poſſibly above or beyond means, the Hand of thy deliverer is more ſignal and conſpicuous, glorifie his mercy and goodneſs: And if thou doſt obtain thy deliverance by means, vet ſtill glorifie his mercy and goodneſs; for it is his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that ſends means, his power and goodneſs that bleſſeth it to its deſired ſucceſs:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50399:59"/>the efficiency and energy of the principal cauſe is that which gives efficacy to the means and makes it effectual.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Endeavour to expreſs thy thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by a ſincere and faithful <hi>Obedience</hi> to the will of that God, that hath thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered thee. A true and hearty thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind will not content it ſelf with bare verbal praiſes and acknowledgements, but will ſtudy and endeavour to find out and do all that may be well-pleaſing and delightful and acceptable to his great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor; and wherever the Heart is truly affected with the ſenſe of the favour, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and love of God, and that the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance it hath had, it hath had from his hand, will think nothing too much to be done, that may be well pleaſing to him. Great acclamations and verbal praiſes and acknowledgements without an honeſt and ſincere endeavour to pleaſe and obey him, are but a piece of mockery and hypocritical complement; and a meer fruſtration and diſappointment of Almighty God, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd and deſign of his mercy to us; which is, to make us really better, more dutiful, more capable of greater and everlaſting mercies; to make us better Examples to others, who may thereby (be) invited to follow us in piety and goodneſs. A man that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50399:60"/>hath received great and ſignal mercies and deliverances, becomes a great and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Example, and of much good, or much evil, according as he carries himſelf after eminent mercies received: If he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more pious, virtuous, juſt, ſober than before, he becomes a forcible motive and encouragement to others, to be like him; again, if he either remain or degenerate into impiety, vanity, or vice, he diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth goodneſs, and becomes a great temptation to others to be like him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Take beed leſt</hi> after great deliverance, <hi>thy Heart be lifted up</hi> into preſumption upon God, pride and vain-glory, and a conceit of thy own goodneſs and worth. This is the common temptation that grows upon much mercy received; and therefore the wiſe Law-giver did very frequently caution the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt this, <hi>Deut. 9.4. Speak not in thy heart after the Lord thy God hath caſt them out, ſaying, For my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Lord hath brought me to poſſeſs this land,</hi> &amp;c. Let thy afflictions find thee humble, and let thy afflictions-make thee more humble; but let thy deliverance yet increaſe thy humility; the more mercy God ſhews to thee, the more humble ever let thy Heart be, upon a double account: 1. Thy deliverances doth or ſhould make thee know
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50399:60"/>Almighty God the more; and the more thou knoweſt him, the more humble it ſhould make thee: <hi>Job 42.5. I have heard of thee by the hearing of the car; but now mine eyes have ſeen thee: wherefore I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi> 2. Thou haſt need to double thy guards of humility, becauſe upon great deliverance thou muſt expect that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation and aſſaults of pride and vain glory will be moſt buſie with thee: And if in all thy preparations for afflictions thou haſt ſtudied humility, if under all thy afflictions thou haſt improved thy humility, yet if now, upon thy deliverance, thou art loſt in pride and vain-glory, thou haſt loſt all the benefit both of thy preparations, and of thy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and of thy deliverance alſo: thou art like an unhappy Ship that hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Sea, and born the Storm, and yet ſinks when ſhe is come into the Harbour.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And upon the ſame account <hi>be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and watchful.</hi> It is true, thou haſt weathered a great Storm, out of which by the mercy of God thou art delivered; but ſtill be upon thy guard, thou knoweſt not how ſoon thou ſhalt meet with another; take heed it ſurprize thee not unprovided. Though thou haſt endured, it may be, a long and dark ſtorm of affliction, and God hath mercifully delivered thee; yet thou haſt no
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50399:61"/>promiſe from Almighty God that thou ſhalt meet with no more. Theſe <hi>three Conſider ations</hi> ſhould keep thee watchful and vigilant, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding great deliverance from great afflictions: 1. Thou art thereby better fitted and prepared to receive it; if it come, it ſhall not ſurprize thee unaware nor find thee ſleeping. 2. Moſt certainly, if any thing be a more likely means, as to preſerve thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſo from affliction, it is a prepared, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, vigilant mind: for, if I may ſo ſpeak, afflictions have no great buſineſs with ſuch a man; for, he is already in that poſture and and frame of Heart, that affliction is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſent to give a man. 3. There is nothing more likely to procure affliction than ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and unpreparedneſs of mind: And that, Firſt, in reſpect of the goodneſs, mercy, and juſtice of God, who, though with moſt unblameable juſtice, yet with ſingular mercy, is very likely to ſend affliction to awaken him and amend him, and to recall him from that tendency to Apoſtacy, that ſecurity is apt to bring upon him. Secondly, in reſpect of the malice and vigilancy of the great Enemy of mankind; who, as he never wants malice, ſo he often gets a permiſſion to worry a man whom he hath under this diſadvantage of unpreparedneſs and ſecurity.</p>

Caſt with thy ſelf, how if theſe were now as freſh to thee as they were then, with what motions or diſpoſitions of Soul thou ſhouldeſt receive them; and reaſon thy ſelf into the ſame temper and habitude of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, as then thou hadſt. By this keeping thy memory of theſe afflictions and theſe deliverances freſh under all its circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thou wilt with them, and in the ſame degree as thy remembrance is of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and excite and preſerve and keep alive and quick and active, the ſame gratitude, the ſame humility, the ſame obedience, the ſame vigilance, that theſe afflictions or theſe deliverances wrought in thee, when they were freth with thee or upon thee. The vigorous perpetuating of the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them, will be an effectual means to perpetuate the due fruit of them in their life, vigour and intention.</p>

            <p>THE only thing that I intend to conſider upon this place of Holy Scripture, is <hi>the Modesty and Reaſonableneſs of</hi> Jacob's <hi>Deſire.</hi> He doth not deſire greatneſs of wealth, or honour, or power, or ſplendour, or great
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50399:63"/>equipage in this World; but all that (he) demes, in reference to this World, is, 1. That the comfortable preſence and ſenſe of the favour and love of God ſhould be with him; <hi>If God will be with me:</hi> 2. That the Protection of the Divine Providence may be continually over him; <hi>and will keep we in the way that I go:</hi> 3. That he would ſupply him, not with curioſities or delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but with neceſſaries; <hi>and will give me bread to eat and ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ment to put on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the truth is, this ſhould be the <hi>Rule und Meaſure of every good man,</hi> in reference to this life, and the enjoyments of it, and the deſires of them, until he come to his Father's houſe in peace; that houſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are many manſions, that the great Father, of whom all the Family in Heaven and Earth is named, hath provided for ſuch as fear, and love, and obey him.</p>
            <p>Indeed the <hi>two former</hi> of theſe, though they be no more than what the bountiful God freely affords to all that truly love him, and depend upon him, are of a ſtrange and vaſt extent. Firſt, the comfortable preſence of God ſupplies abundantly all that can be deſired by us, and abundantly countervails whatſoever elſe we ſeem to want; it is better than life it ſelf: And when the Ancients would expreſs all that ſeemed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50399:63"/>beneficial or proſperous in this life, they had no ſuller and comprehenſive expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, than that God was with him: <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39. 3. <hi>And when his master ſaw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to proſper:</hi> 1 Sam. 18. 14, 28. the wiſdom and courage and ſucceſs of <hi>David</hi> (is) reſolved into this one thing, The Lord was with him.</p>
            <p>But certainly, though the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſhould not manifeſt it ſelf in external ſucceſſes and advantages, the very ſenſe of the ſavour and comfortable preſence of God carries with it an abundant ſupply of all other deficiences. <hi>Pſal. 4. 6, 7.</hi> The light of the countenance of Almighty God is the moſt ſupereminent good, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions more true joy and contentment, than the redundance of all external advantages. Secondly, the Divine protection and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is the moſt ſure and ſafe protection, and ſupplies the want of all other. The munition of Rocks is thy defence; and all other deſences and refuges without this, are weak, impotent, and failing defences. <hi>Except the Lord watch the city, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man watcheth but in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That therefore which I ſhall fix upon is <hi>the laſt</hi> of his three deſires: <hi>If he ſhall give me meat to drink and rayment to put on.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:50399:64"/>
            <p>The deſires of a good man, in relation to the things of this life, ought not to be laviſh and extravagant; not to be of things for grandeur, or delicacy, or exceſs: but to be terminated in things of neceſſity for his preſent ſubſiſtence, convenient food and rayment. If Almighty God give more than this, it is matter of the greater gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as it was to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32. 10. <hi>I am not worthy of the least of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for with my ſtaff, I paſſed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands:</hi> But if he gives no more, we have enough for our contentation. Almighty God, who is never worſe than his word, but moſt commonly better, hath not given us any promiſe of more, neither hath he given us commiſſion to expect or ask for more. If he gives more than neceſſary, he exalts his bounty and benificence: and yet, if he gives no more, it is bounty that he gives ſo much; and is matter both of our contentation, and gratitude.</p>
            <p>This the wiſe man <hi>Agur</hi> made his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, <hi>Prov. 30. 8. Give me neither poverty, nor riches: ſeed me with food convenient for me.</hi> This our Lord teacheth us to ask, in his excellent form of Prayer; <hi>Give us this day our daily bread:</hi> and this is that which the Apoſtle preſcribes, for the Rule of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50399:64"/>our contentation, 1 <hi>Tim. 6.8. And having food and rayment, let us be therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And truly, if it pleaſeth God to allow us a ſufficiency and competency, for the neceſſity of our nature, we have very great <hi>Reaſon</hi> to be contented with it, not only as it is (a) duty enjoyned unto us, but upon moſt evident conviction of ſound Reaſon, both in regard unto Almighty God, in regard of our ſelves, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of others. I ſhall mingle theſe <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> together.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It becomes us to be contented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>whatſoever we have, we have from the free allowance, bounty, and goodneſs of God:</hi> he owes us nothing; but what we have, we have from free gift and bounty. If a man demands a debt of another, we think it juſt he ſhould be paid what he demands; but if a man receive an alms from another, we think it reaſonable he ſhould be content with what the other gives, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to the meaſure of his bounty. But the caſe is far ſtronger here: we are under an obligation of duty to be charitable to others wants, by virtue of a Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand but Almighty God is under no other law of conferring benefits, but of his own bounty, goodneſs, and will.</p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:50399:65"/>
            <p n="2">2. It becomes us to be content, becauſe <hi>our meaſure and dole is given unto us,</hi> as by him that is abſolute Lord of his own bounty, ſo <hi>by him that is the wiſeſt diſpenſer</hi> of his own benefits: he knows, far better, than we our ſelves, what proportion is fitteſt for us: he hath given us enough for our neceſſity, and we are deſirous to have ſomewhat more; the wiſe God knows, it may be, that more would do us harm, would undo us; would make us luxurious, proud, inſolent, domineering, forgetful of God. The great Lord and Maſter of the great Family of the World, knows who are, and who are not able to bear redundancy: And therefore if I have food convenient for me, I have reaſon to be content, becauſe I have reaſon to believe the great and wiſe God knows what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion beſt ſits me; it may be, if I had more, I were ruined.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt know that <hi>we are but Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> of the very external bleſſings of this life; and at the great Audit, we muſt give an account of our Stewardſhip, and thoſe Accounts will be ſtrictly peruſed by the great Lord of all the Family in Heaven and Earth. Now if our external benefits be but proportionable to our neceſſities and neceſſary uſe, our Account is eaſily and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50399:65"/>ſafely made: <hi>Imprimis,</hi> I have received ſo much of thy external bleſſings as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for my food and clothing, and for the feeding and clothing of my Family: But on the other ſide, where there is a ſuperfluity and redundance given over and above our neceſſary ſupport, the account is more difficult. <hi>where much is given, much will be required.</hi> There will be an account required, how the redundant over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus was employed; how much in Charity, how much in other good works: and God knows that too too often very pitiful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts are made of the ſurpluſage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy of a liberal Eſtate; which will be ſo far from abating the account, as it will enhance it: <hi>Item</hi> ſo much in exceſs, debauchery, and riot; ſo much in coſtly apparel; ſo much in magnificence and vain ſhews, and the like.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our natures may be well enough ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with little; <hi>Natura pancis contenta;</hi> and whatſoever is redundant, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly turns to the damage and detriment of our nature, unleſs it meet with a very wiſe proprietor: For the exceſs in the abuſe of ſuperfluities in eating and drink ing, and gratifying our appetites; or the exceſs of care and pains in getting, or keeping, or diſpoſing ſuperfluities and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundance,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50399:66"/>commonly doth more harm, even to our natural complexions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, than a mediocrity proportionate to the neceſſities of nature.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Whatſoever is more</hi> than enough for our natural ſupport, and the neceſſary ſupply of our Families, and ſo emplyed <hi>is in truth, vain, uſeleſs, unſerviceable;</hi> and ſuch a man is rich but in fancy and notion, and not in truth and reality: For the uſe of externals is ſupply of our natural neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; if I have a million of Money, and yet a hundred Pounds is ſufficient, and as much as I ſhall uſe to bring me to my Grave; the reſt is vain and needleſs to me, and doth me no good: it is indeed my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and my care, and my trouble; but is of no more uſe to me in my Cheſt, than if it were in the center of the Earth. It is true, I have thereby a happy opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, if I have a large and a wiſe Heart to diſpoſe it for the glory and ſervice of God, and the good of mankind, in works of piety, charity, and humanity: but if I keep it in my Cheſt, it is an impertinent trouble, neither uſeful for my ſelf, becauſe I need it not, I have enough without it; nor as I order it is it uſeful for others, no more than if it were an hundred fathom under gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6.<hi>A ſtate of Mediocrity</hi> or ſupplies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to my neceſſity, is infinitely <hi>more ſafe to me,</hi> even in reſpect of my ſelf, than an eſtate of glory, wealth, power, and abundance; an eſtate of mediocrity and commenſurateneſs to our exigence and neceſſity is the freeſt of any condition in the world from perturbations and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; a ſtate and condition of want, and too narrow for our neceſſities, is an eſtate ſubject to ſome troubles and temptations: But of all conditions in the world, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant and over-plentiful condition is moſt ſubject to the moſt dangerous and pernicious temptations in the world: as namely, forgetfulneſs of God, ſelf-depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, pride, inſolence, oppreſſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, unquietneſs of mind, exceſs, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury, intemperance, contempt of others: and I have very often known thoſe perſons that have carried themſelves ſteadily and commendably in a condition of mediocrity, nay have been able to bear with vict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ry the ſhocks of thoſe temptations that ariſe from want and poverty, yet when in the late times they were advanced to wealth, power and command, were loſt and could not bear the temptations that attended grandeur, wealth and power; and the Sun of wealth and proſperity quickly diſrobed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50399:67"/>them of that mantle of innocence, piety and virtue, that they kept about them againſt the ſtorms and aſſaults of wants and neceſſities. So that certainly it requires a greater vigilance, attention, induſtry and reſolution, to oppoſe and conquer the temptations of grandeur, wealth, and power, than the temptations of want, neceſſity, and poverty: Some patience and humility will do much to ſubdue the latter; but he that will acquit himſelf from the temptations of the former, hath, and hath need of, great wiſdom, moderation, ſobriety, and a low eſteem of the world, and eſpecially, a great and practical exerciſe of the Fear of God, Faith in his promiſes, and a fixed hope and proſpect of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of immortality and glory, whereby they may overcome the ſlattering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving world.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A ſtate of externals proportionate to our neceſſities is a far <hi>more ſerene and ſafe</hi> eſtate <hi>in reference to others;</hi> than an eſtate of external grandeur, and wealth and power: And the reaſons are, firſt, becauſe the former hath nothing that others do covet or deſire, but the latter hath gotten the golden Ball, that the generality of mankind are fond to have, and are reſtleſs till they have gotten (it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:50399:67"/>the man's eſtate unquiet and unſafe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath many competitors for what he enjoys, which are continually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to trip up his heels: juſt as we ſee when a Bird hath gotten a booty or prey, all other Birds of prey are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and catching after it, and ever moleſting him that hath it. Secondly, becauſe he that enjoys much, either of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or wealth, or power, is the object of the envy of other men, which is a buſie, reſtleſs, pernicious humour, and ever picking quarrels and finding faults, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying and endeavouring the ruine of its object: Whereas a ſtate of mediocrity, is a ſtate of quietneſs, and free from the aſſaults and ſhafts of this peſtilent companion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We ſee that all worldly matters are by a kind of inbred and connatural ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity <hi>ſubject to mutations and changes.</hi> When grandeur, and honour, and wealth are at their higheſt pitch, like the Sun in the Meridian, it ſtays not long there, but hath its declination. Now the changes that are incident to greatneſs and wealth, are always for the worſt; they moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take their wings and ſly away, when they ſeem to be in their higheſt pitch of plenty and glory: And this creates in a man very great anxiety and reſtleſs fear,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:50399:68"/>leſt he ſhould loſe what he hath; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſtruglings and ſhiſtings to keep it when it is going; and extreme diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vexation and ſorrow when it is gone. On the other ſide, a ſtate of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity may have its changes too; and as it (is) ſeldom for the worſe, ſo it is moſt ordinarily for the better; whereby the man hath great peace and tranquility. We need not have a better inſtance of both theſe conditions than in <hi>Jacob,</hi> the perſon in the Text: While he was in a ſtate of mediocrity, and rather indeed, in a ſtrait, than in an ample condition; when he had nothing but his Staff, and his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Bread to eat, and Clothes to put on, he was in a ſtate of great tranquility; and that change which befell that condition, was a change not for the worſe, but for the better, at leaſt in relation to externals, his ſupplies increaſed; but as ſoon as he once arrived at great wealth, under his Uncle <hi>Laban,</hi> though, it is true, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence kept him from a total loſs of it, yet he ſoon found that proſperous condition full of thorns and difficulties: 1. His Uncle and his Sons began to envy his wealth, and he began to be in great fears and jealouſies leſt he ſhould be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all. 2. Then to avoid that fear,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50399:68"/>he flyes, and his Uncle purſues him; and then he was under a new fear of loſs of all he had got. 3. When that fear was over, then he fears that the rumor of his wealth, and the former diſpleaſure of his Brother <hi>Eſau</hi> might make him and all his wealth a prey to his Brother; and certainly, had not the immediate provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Almighty God ſtrangely interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he had not only ſelt the difficulties and unquietneſs of his great wealthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition (which were profitable for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction) but he had ſuffered a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of it, either by <hi>Laban,</hi> or <hi>Eſau,</hi> or at leaſt by the neighbours of the <hi>Shechemites,</hi> exaſperated by the treachery and cruelty of his two Sons <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe and many more Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, it is moſt evident, That a ſtate of mediocrity in externals is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before an eſtate of much wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or grandeur; that of the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, poverty on the one ſide, or very great wealth and glory on the other; the latter is in truth more dangerous and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult than the former; but that <hi>Agur's</hi> Prayer, a ſtate of mediocrity, neither po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty nor riches, but food convenient for a man's coudition is the moſt deſireable
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50399:69"/>ſtate in this life, and that which avoids the difticulty of both extremes.</p>
            <p>I would willingly from theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations therefore learn <hi>to attain ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and diſpoſition of Soul as might be ſafe and uſeful for me in relation to all theſe three Conditions of Life,</hi> which-ſoever of them the Divine Providence ſhould ſend unto me.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reference to a <hi>Mediocrity</hi> or ſuch a ſtate of externals, as might be ſuitable to the exigence and nature of my condition in this life: I ſhould make ſuch a ſtate my choice, and not my trouble; I ſhould with all thankfulneſs acknowledge both the goodneſs, and wiſdom of Almighty God, in giving me ſo competent, and ſo ſafe a condition; that hath by his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence delivered me from the difficulties, and inconveniencies, and dangers, and temptations of both extremes, namely, great want, and great wealth: and I ſhall bear my lot, not only with great patience and quietneſs, but with great contentation and thankfulneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reference to an <hi>eſtate of Want or Indagence:</hi> If it ſhould pleaſe the Divine Providence to appoint that condition to me, I ſhould nevertheleſs comfort and ſupport my ſelf with ſuch Conſiderations
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50399:69"/>as theſe: 1. Though my condition be narrow and neceſſitous, yet it is that, which the great wiſe Lord of the great Family of the World, hath appointed to me; I will therefore bear it with patience and reſignation. 2. Though it be an eſtate of indigence and narrowneſs, yet it is ſuch as affords me and my Family life and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, though not without much pains and difliculty: it might have been worſe, and it may pleaſe;God to make it better, when he ſees fit; I will therefore bear it with contentedneſs, as well as patience. 3. Though my ſtate be very narrow and pinching, yet it is poſſibly much more ſafe, than an eſtate of grandeur and affluence: my account is the leſs; my temptations not ſo dangerous; my cares fewer; my leſſons of dependence upon God, of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and lowlineſs of mind, of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſobriety, of contempt of the World, of valuation of Eternity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for it, are better learned in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme than in the other: I ſhall therefore endeavour to improve the opportunities, even of this hard condition, and bear it not only with contentedneſs, but thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In reference to <hi>an eſtate of Redundance</hi> and Affluence of externals, an eſtate of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50399:70"/>wealth and plenty, of honour and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, of power and authority and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence; I will conſider, 1. That this is an eſtate full of temptations, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the greateſt ſize and the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous nature; as, pride and inſolence, forgetfulneſs of God, luxury, intemperance, carnal confidence and ſecurity, contempt of others, and infinite more; and if any of theſe get the advantage, they will do me more miſchief, than all my wealth will do me good. 2. Therefore I will learn and exerciſe very great vigilance and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that I be not cheated into theſe temptations. 3. I will take a true eſtimate of the World, and of all theſe goodly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances that I am attended with from it; and I will not take my meaſure <hi>and</hi> eſtimate of them by common opinion of the world, or by their ſplendid outſide, but I will look more ſtrictly into them, and find whether they are not incertain, deceiving things; what ſtability there is in them; what good they will do me after death; what quietneſs or tranquility of mind they will give me, or rather take from me; whether they have in themſelves any real influence to make me better or wiſer. 4. Upon theſe Conſiderations (if) I find, as find I ſhall, that they have not that real
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50399:70"/>worth in them that the vain World ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, I will not ſet my Heart upon them, nor lay any confidence upon them, nor lay out much of my love unto them, or any great eſteem for them. 5. I will ſet my Heart to a true and ſerious conſideration of thoſe durable riches and glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that our dear Lord hath provided for us in the life to come; and that eternal weight of glory will infinitely out-weigh all the wealth, and honour, and glory that I do or can enjoy in this World. 6. And upon this conſideration alſo I will rectifie my judgment concerning this World, and the greateſt glory of it; and thereby ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate my ſelf to a low eſteem of the wealth I have, or can have, and ſet up my hopes and treaſure in more noble and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enjoyments. 7. I will conſider I am but a Steward when all is done, and the greater my wealth or honour is, the greater my account muſt be, and the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to keep them fair. 8. That in as much I am but a Steward, I will be very careful, that my management of my truſt may be ſuch as will bear my Lord's ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny. I will not employ my ſtock of wealth or honour to the diſhonour of my Lord, in riot or exceſs, in vanity or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; but will do as much good with
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50399:71"/>it as I can, according to the truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to me, that I may give a juſt and fair and comfortable account of my Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardſhip when my Lord and Maſter calls for it. 9. That in as much as thoſe very externals are in themſelves bleſſings, if well employed, though not the bleſſings of the greateſt magnitude; I will with all humility and thankfulneſs acknowledge the Divine Bounty to me, in truſting me with Abundance, and will employ it to his Honour.</p>

            <p>THere are <hi>Three excellent Virtues</hi> which eſpecially refer to our condition in this life, and much conduce to our ſafe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable paſſage through them.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Equality of Mind,</hi> or <hi>AEquanimity.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Patience.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>Contentedneſs.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:50399:73"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Equality of Mind</hi> or <hi>Equanimity,</hi> is that virtue which refers both to proſperity and adverſity, whereby in all conditions of that kind we carry an even and equal temper, neither over-much lifted up by proſperity, nor over-much depreſſed in adverſity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Patience</hi> properly refers to croſſes, diſappointment, afflictions, and adverſity, whereby we carry a quiet and ſubmiſſive mind, without murmuring, paſſion, or diſcompoſure of ſpirit, in all afflictions, whether ſickneſs, loſs of friends, poverty, reproach, diſgrace, or the like.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Contentation;</hi> which differs from equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mind, becauſe that reſpects as well proſperity as adverſity, this only adverſity; and in ſome reſpects differs alſo from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience (though this always accompanies it) 1. In the extent of the object, for patience reſpects all kinds of affliction; contentedneſs, in propriety of ſpeech, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects principally the affliction of want or poverty. 2. In the act it ſelf, for patience, in propriety of ſpeech, implyes only a quiet compoſed toleration of the evils of adverſity, but contentedneſs imports ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, namely, not only a quietneſs of mind, but a kind of cheerful, free ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to our preſent condition of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, a ready compliance with the Divine
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50399:73"/>Providence, and, in effect, a choice of that ſtate wherein the Divine Diſpenſation placeth us, as well as in bearing it.</p>
            <p>Theſe, though they may in ſtrictneſs give a diſtinction between Patience and Contentation, yet we muſt obſerve that Contentation is never without Patience, though it be ſomething more: and that in the common acceptation and latitude of the word, Contentation doth not only extend to the condition or affliction of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, but even to all other outward affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions reached to us by the inflicting or permitting hand of Divine Providence: and in this large acceptation I ſhall here apply and uſe it.</p>
            <p>Content therefore, in its large acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, is not only a quiet and patient, but alſo a free and cheerful cloſing with that eſtate and condition of life, which the Divine Diſpenſation ſhall allott unto us, whether mean, or poor, or laborious, and painful, or obſcure, or neceſſitous, or ſickly, or unhealthy, or without friends, or with loſs or abſence of friends, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs of friends, or any other ſtate that ſeems ungrateful to our natures or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. For we need not apply this virtue to a ſtate of high proſperity in all things, wherein (though men are not ordinarily
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50399:74"/>contented) yet they have but ſmall tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to diſcontent from the eſtate it ſelf wherein they ſo are.</p>
            <p>This leſſon of Contentation was <hi>learnt</hi> by this Apoſtle, which imports theſe things: 1. That it is a leſſon that is poſſible to be learned, for the Apoſtle had learned it. 2. That it is a leſſon that requires ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of induſtry and pains to acquire it, for he learned it before he attained it. 3. That it is a leſſon that deſerves the learning, for he ſpeaks of it as of a thing of moment and great uſe, well worth the pains he took to attain it. And the truth is, it is of ſo great importance to be learned, that without it we want the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our lives, and with it all conditions of life are not only tolerable but comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And hence it is that this excellent Apoſtle doth very often inculcate and preſs and commend this leſſon in many of his Epiſtles. 1 Tim. <hi>6.6. Godlineſs with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is great gain.</hi> Heb. 13.5. <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have; for he hath ſaid, I will not leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Again, 1 Tim. 6.8. <hi>And having food and rayment let us be therewith content.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore ſet down thoſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> that may perſwade and encourage us to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50399:74"/>contentation with our condition, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to patience under it; for patience and contentation cannot be well ſevered. And the Reaſons are <hi>of two ſorts;</hi> 1. Moral, 2. Divine and Evangelical. Neither ſhall I decline the uſe of Moral Reaſons, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how far by the help of theſe many Heathens (that had not the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God revealed in his Word and Son) advanced in the practice of theſe virtues. The <hi>Moral Reaſons</hi> therefore are theſe:
<list>
                  <item>1. Very many of the external evils we ſuffer are of <hi>our own choice and procurement,</hi> the fruits of our own follies and inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and averſeneſs to good counſel: And why ſhould we be diſcontented, or impatient under thoſe evils which we our ſelves have choſen, or repine becauſe theſe trees bear their natural fruit?</item>
                  <item>2. The greateſt part of evils we ſuffer are of that nature and kind, that are <hi>not in our power</hi> either to prevent or help: Some come from the very condition of our nature, as ſickneſſes, death of friends; and of abſolute neceſſity, the more relations any man hath, the more evils of this kind we may ſuffer: And can we reaſonably expect that the very natures of things ſhould be changed to pleaſe our humour?
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50399:75"/>Again, ſome come from the hands of men that it may be are powerful, more ſubtil and malicious: Why ſhould we diſcontent our ſelves or be impatient becauſe others are too ſtrong for us? Others again come by occurtences natural (though diſpoſed by the hand of the Divine Providence) as loſſes by ſtorms and tempeſts, by unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable weather, by intemperateneſs of the air or meteors. Can we reaſonably expect that the great God of Heaven and Earth ſhould alter his ſetled Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the convenience of every ſuch little Worm as you or I am? It may be that ſtorm or intemperate ſeaſon that may do you or me ſome prejudice, may do others as many and as good, or it may be more and better, a benefit: that wind that ſtrikes my Ship againſt the Rock, may fetch off two or more from the Sands. Let us be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therefore to ſuffer Almighty God to govern the World according to his wiſdom and not our will, though it may be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular detriment to you or to me: or if we repine againſt it, we muſt not think thereby to obtain our own wills.</item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>texture and frame of the World</hi> is ſuch, that it is abſolutely neceſſary that, if ſome be rich and powerful, or great, or honorable, others muſt be poor, and ſubject,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50399:75"/>and ignoble: If all were equally powerful, there would be no power nor government, becauſe all would be equal; if all were equally rich, it would be but only nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, indeed none would be rich, but all would be poor, there could be no Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, no Labourers, no Servants. Since therefore it is of neceſſity, in the order of the World, that ſome muſt be poor, or leſs rich or powerful than others, why ſhould I be ſo unreaſonable, or unjuſt, to deſire that lot of poverty or lowneſs of condition ſhould be another's and not mine? Or, why ſhould not I be contented to be of the lower fort of men, ſince the order of the World requires that ſuch ſome muſt be?</item>
                  <item>4. Let any man obſerve it whiles he will, he ſhall find that whatſoever of <hi>worldly advantages</hi> any man doth moſt plentifully enjoy, and moſt men moſt greedily deſire, of neceſſity he muſt thereby have <hi>more croſſes and afflictions.</hi> A man deſires many Children, Friends, Relations; the more he hath of theſe, the more mortal dying comforts he hath; the more he hath that muſt be ſick, and ſuffer affliction, and dye: and every one of theſe afflictions or loſſes in a man's Relations, are ſo many renewed afflictions, and croſſes, and troubles to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50399:76"/>A man deſires wealth, and hath it; the more cares and fears he hath; and the more he hath the more he hath to loſe, and of neceſſity he muſt have more loſſes the more he hath: as he that hath a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Sheep muſt in probability loſe more in a year than he that hath but forty: And beſides, Wealth is the common mark that every man ſhoots at, and every man will be pulling ſomewhat from him that hath much, becauſe every man thinks he hath enough for others as well as himſelf. A man deſires honour, power, grandeur, and he hath it: but every man envies him, and is ready to unhorſe him, and a ſmall neglect, reproach or misfortune ſits cloſer to ſuch a man, than to a meaner man; and the more of honour or power he hath, the more of ſuch breaches he ſhall be ſure to meet with. A man deſires long life, and accordingly enjoyes it: but in the tract of long life a man is ſure to meet with more ſickneſſes, more croſſes, more loſs of friends and relations, and over-lives the greateſt part of his external comforts, and in Old age becomes his own burthen.</item>
                  <item>5. If a man deſire much wealth or power, and enjoyes it, yet it is certain ſo much the more thereof he hath, ſo much the leſs others have; for he hath that which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50399:76"/>might otherwiſe be divided among many. Why therefore ſhould a man deſire it, or diſcontent himſelf, if he have it not, ſince what he thus enjoys is with another's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and loſs, who would have a ſhare in it, if he had it not alone? And why ſhould I covet that, or be diſcontented if I have it not, ſince if I have it, I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the like diſcontent in others.</item>
                  <item>6. It is certain in <hi>the courſe of the World,</hi> there are and muſt be a greater number of croſſes and troubles, and of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than there are of External Comforts, nay there is ſearce any comfort that any man hath, but like <hi>Jonah's</hi> Gourd, it hath a Worm growing at the root of it, which doth not only wither the comfort it ſelf, but moſt times creates greater trouble and ſorrow, than the comfort it ſelf hath good if entirely enjoyed. A man hath many Children, it may be they are all very good and hopeful, yet they are mortal, and if they dye, the death of ſuch a Child is ſo much the more grievous, by how much the more good and towardly he was. But if any of them prove vicious, fooliſh or naught, by how much a Child is nearer than a ſtranger, by ſo much the more his vices give trouble, ſorrow, and care to his Parent: So that in all worldly things, the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50399:77"/>ſtock of troubles is greater three to one, than that of comforts; ſo true is that of Job, <hi>A man is born to troubles as the ſparks fly upwards.</hi> Why therefore ſhould a man ſink into diſcontent, becauſe the World doth but <hi>ſolitum obtinere,</hi> and follows its own natural complexion and ſtate.</item>
                  <item>7. We are generally greatly <hi>miſtaken in the nature of Good and Evil,</hi> and have not the true meaſures of it. That is truly relatively Good which makes a man the better, and that truly Evil in its relative nature, which makes a man the worſe. If proſperity and ſucceſs make me thankful, watchful, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, benificent, then is proſperity good to me, for it makes me better; but if it make me proud, haughty, inſolent, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering, vain-glorious, it is evil to me. If adverſity make me clamorous, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, envious, ſpightful, injurious, then 'tis evil to me; but if it makes me humble, ſober, patient, then 'tis good to me. And let any man impartially take the meaſure of the very ſame man or divers men in each condition, he ſhall find ten to one receive more miſchief by proſperity than by adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Why ſhould I then not content my ſelf with that condition which is more ſaſe to me, and makes me the better man, though not, the richer or greater.</item>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:50399:77"/>
                  <item>8. Which is but a farther explication of what is ſaid next before. It is certain that a good man is like the <hi>Elixir,</hi> it turns Iron into Gold, and makes the moſt ſowre condition of life not only tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but uſeful and convenient. If I be ſuch, I mould and frame my worſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition into a condition of comfort and contentment by my patience and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Why ſhould I then be diſcontented with my condition, ſince by the grace of God I am able to make it what I pleaſe? If I can content my ſelf with the good temper and diſpoſition of my own Heart and Soul, I have no reaſon to be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with my condition, for if I find it not good I can make it ſuch by the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, patience, and temper of my own mind: And that the mind is the principal matter in contentation or diſcontent, we need no other inſtance than that of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> the one a great King, the other a great Favourite of a mighty Monarch, full of wealth and honour; yet a covetous mind in one and a proud mind in the other, made the former ſick for a little ſpot of ground, and the latter grow to ſo high a degree of diſcontent for want of the knee of a poor <hi>Jew,</hi> that it withered all his enjoyments. 1 <hi>King. 21.5. Heſt. 5.13.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:50399:78"/>
                  <item>9. <hi>Diſcontent and Impatience galls</hi> a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times <hi>more than the croſs or affliction</hi> doth. We owe more of the evil of croſſes, troubles, and afflictions, to the unquiet, reſtleſs, impatient, diſtemper of our mind, than to them. We are like men in a Feaver, that infinitely increaſe their heat by their toſſing and tumbling more than if they lay ſtill, and then they complain of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſineſs of their Bed: Like the Prophet's wild Bull in a Net we intangle and tyre our ſelves worſe with our ſtrugling than if we were more patient and ſtill; or like the Ship, it is not broken by the Rock, but by its own violent motion againſt it. Why then ſhould I diſcontent and diſquiet my ſelf with my condition, when I make it and my ſelf thereby worſe and more uneaſy?</item>
                  <item>10. As my diſcontentedneſs and unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs renders my condition the more uneaſy, ſo it <hi>no way conduceth to my reſcue from it:</hi> For ſince I cannot be ſo brutiſh as to think that the occurrences which befall men are without a Divine Conduct, ſo it is certain that all his Diſpenſations are wiſe and directed to a wiſe end; and even affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions themſelves have their errand and buſineſs, to make men more humble, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and conſiderate. If I correct my Child
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50399:78"/>for his fault, and he continue ſtill more ſtubborn, I ſhall correct him longer till he return to his ſubmiſſiveneſs and duty. Why then ſhould I diſcontent my ſelf, and be impatient under my affliction, when it is not only vain and fruitleſs thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect deliverance, but in all probability the likelyeſt way to keep me ſtill under it.</item>
                  <item>11. As thus my condition is not amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but made the worſe, more ſevere, and laſting by my impatience and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſo <hi>Patience and Contentation will give</hi> me theſe <hi>great advantages:</hi> 1. In all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability it will ſhorten my affliction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath obtained its effect and end, and the meſſage it brings is duly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. 2. But howſoever it will make in infinitely more eaſy, the leſs I ſtruggle under it. 3. And, which is the beſt of all, it gives me the poſſeſſion of my own Soul, internal peace and tranquility of mind, a kind and comfortable ſerenity of ſpirit. I remain Maſter of my paſſions, of my intellectuals, of my ſelf, and am not tranſported into another thing, than what becomes a reaſonable man: though there be ſtorms and tempeſts and rolling ſeas without me, yet all is calm and quiet within. Contentation and patience ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders my outward condition of little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50399:79"/>to me, ſo long as it gives me the opportunity to poſſeſs and enjoy me ſelf, my virtue and goodneſs, and the atteſtation of a good Conſcience.</item>
                  <item>12. Though I want ſomewhat that others have, yet 'tis ten to one that <hi>I have ſomewhat that many</hi> as good, if not better, <hi>want.</hi> It may be I want wealth, yet I have health; it may be I want health, yet I have Children, that others want. I will learn contentment. by conſidering others wants and my enjoyments, and not learn diſcontent from others enjoyments and my own wants.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe be the Moral Conſiderations, and truly they be of great weight, moment, and uſe, and, as I ſaid, carried the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then a great way in the virtues of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation and Patience: But yet they often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times failed, and were too weak to compoſe the mind under a ſtorm of croſſes, loſſes, and afflictions; and therefore Almighty God hath furniſhed us with a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way, which lets me into the Second Conſideration, namely, the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Evangelical Helps</hi> to Patience and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Their number will not be ſo many as the former, but their weight and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy greater, and they are ſuch as theſe:
<list>
                  <item>1. The worſt I here ſuffer is <hi>leſs than</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:50399:79"/>
                     <hi>I deſerve,</hi> and the leaſt that I enjoy is more than I can in juſtice expect; it is but gift and bounty: I have therefore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be content and thankful for the leaſt merey, and to be patient and quiet under my greateſt evil.</item>
                  <item>2. There is no affliction, croſs, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life, but <hi>is reached out to us from the Hand or Permiſſion of the moſt glorious Sovereign</hi> of all the World, to whom we owe an infinite ſubjection, becauſe we have our being from him: And therefore it is but juſt and reaſonable for us to content our ſelves with what he is pleaſed thus to inflict: and the greateſt croſs or affliction of this life, is not anſwerable to his bounty and goodneſs in giving us being.</item>
                  <item>3. He is not only the abſolute Sovereign of us, and all the World, but he is the <hi>moſt Juſt and wiſe</hi> Governour of it, and all men, and all the diſpenſations of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>are</hi> directed to moſt juſt, wiſe, and excellent ends: And therefore we have all imaginable reaſon, not only patiently to ſubmit, but cheerfully and contentedly to bear any condition that he diſpenſeth, and, with an implicit faith, to reſign our wills to his, as being aſſured it is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more wiſe and juſt than ours. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are the acts of his Juſtice to
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50399:80"/>puniſh us for ſome paſt offence; but always the acts of his Wiſdom, either to try us, to reclaim us, to prevent us from worſe evils; or to amend us, to make us more humble, watchful, dutiful, circumſpect; to draw us off from too much reſting on the World; to make us bethink our ſelves of our duty, and returning to him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, faith and obedience.</item>
                  <item>4. He is not only a Wiſe and Juſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, but a <hi>most Merciful and tender Father,</hi> and one that out of very faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, love, and goodneſs corrects us, as a Father doth his Son he entirely loveth: and upon this account we may reſt aſſured, 1. That he never afflicts, or ſends, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits any croſs to fall upon us, but it is for our everlaſting, and many times for our temporal, good: 2. That no croſs or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſhall lye longer or heavier upon us, than is conducible to our good: 3. That he doth, and will always, ſend along his Staff with his Rod, his Grace with his Affliction, to tutor and inſtruct us, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort us; and if we find not this ſupport in our greateſt affliction, it is not becauſe it is wanting to us, but becauſe we are wanting to it, to lay hold upon it, and improve it.</item>
                  <item>5. For our farther aſſurance of his love

                  </item>
                  <item>6. He hath given us the greateſt pledge of his love and goodneſs, that the moſt doubting or craving Heart in the World could ever deſire; his Son to be our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: And how ſhall he not with Him give us all things needful, uſeful and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial? <hi>Rom. 8.32.</hi>

            <p>This Son of his he made the Captain of our Salvation, and yet he made him a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief, <hi>Iſa. 53.3.</hi> and made perfect by ſufferings, <hi>Heb. 2.9, 10.</hi> And this Son of God did bear, not only with patience, but with reſignation, and contentation of mind: Matth. 26.39. <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt:</hi> Lu. 12.50. <hi>I have a baptiſm to be baptized withal, and how am I ſtraitned till it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed?</hi> and when all was done, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that was made a little lower than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, for the ſuffering of death, was crowned with glory and honour; <hi>That he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for every man. For it became him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſens to glory, to make the captain of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50399:81"/>perfect through ſufferings.</hi> Heb. 2.9. and this was done (beſides that Expiatory Sacrifice thereby made for us) for theſe <hi>admirable Ends:</hi> 1. That we might ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, the ordinary method of the Divine Diſpenſation, his own Eternal Son, that knew no ſin, yet was made a man of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows: and then why ſhould we, poor ſinful men, expect to be exempted and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge more than the Eternal Son, in whom God from Heaven proclaimed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf well pleaſed? 2. That we might have an Example before us: He, that is made the Captain of our Salvation, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be the common pattern and image, whereunto all his diſciples and followers are to be conformed, both paſſively and actively: he was exhibited as the Firſt-born among many Brethren; the common image according to which, all his diſciples and followers ſhould be conformed. <hi>Rom. 8.29.</hi> As he was made perfect by ſufferings, ſo muſt we; and as he through a vail of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings paſſed into Glory, ſo muſt we; that if we ſuffer with him, we may be glorified with him: He was exhibited, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtandard and pattern of a Chriſtian's condition, in the loweſt eſtate that can befall him in this life: and ſurely we have reaſon to be contented to be conformed,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50399:81"/>and ſubject to the condition of the Captain of our Salvation. 3. That as he was thus exhibited as a paſſive example of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, ſo he became an active example for our imitation; full of quietneſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs, ſubmiſſion, patience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, to give us an example, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 21.</hi> and to imprint upon us the ſame temper and frame of mind, <hi>Phil. 2.6.</hi> that whiles we behold his example, we may, by a ſecret ſympathy, be transformed, as it were, into the ſame mould and image. 4. That we might have this great pledge and aſſurance, that he who once lived in this world, and had experience of the difficulties and troubles of it, and is now tranſlated to the right hand of the glorious Majeſty of God, and hath the proſpect of all our wants, and needs, and ſorrows, and troubles, and ſufferings, and of the degrees of ſtrength we have to bear it, and hath the plenitude of power to ſupport, to ſtrengthen and deliver us; I ſay, that we may be aſſured, that he is a merciful and faithful High Prieſt, ſenſible, and compaſſionate of our condition; <hi>Heb. 2. 18.</hi> for in that he himſelf ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</p>
            <p>Thus it hath pleaſed the goodneſs of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50399:82"/>Almighty God, (who knows our frame and conſiders that we are but duſt) to uſe as much indulgence and compliance, as is poſſible for a moſt tender Father to his weak and froward Children: That ſince he knows, affliction and croſſes are as neceſſary for us as the very beſt of all our bleſſings, yet he gives us all the helps and ſupplies that are imaginable, with the greateſt ſuitableneſs to our nature, to make them eaſie, ſupportable, and profitable; and to bear us up to bear them, with the greateſt patience and contentation. We cannot be without them, for then we are very apt to grow proud and ſecure, ſelf-conceited, inſolent, to ſet our reſt, and be building of Tabernacles here, to dread and fear death beyond all meaſure and order, and to be utterly unprovided for it, to be deſirous to take our portion in this life, and to make our Heaven on this ſide death; as the two Tribes deſired their lot on this ſide <hi>Jordan,</hi> becauſe they found it convenient. (<hi>Num. 32.</hi>) And though we cannot well be without them, yet we frand in need of daily helps to bear them patiently, contentedly, and and profitably; and we are accordingly, by the Divine Goodneſs, furniſhed with helps ſuitable to our condition and frame.</p>
            <p>As all the afflictions, croſſes, and troubles
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50399:82"/>of this life, are managed by the wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Government of the moſt wiſe and merciful God, and have their voice, errand, and meſſage from him to us, <hi>(Hear the Rod and him that hath appointed it:)</hi> So, he hath given us the ineſtimable Jewel of his Word, to expound and unriddle what he means by them, and to inſtruct us how to carry our ſelves under them; how to improve them all for our ſpiritual and everlaſting good; how with patience and cheerfulneſs to undergo them; how to be drawn the nearer to God by them. And to this end he hath given us moſt divine and wiſe counſels touching them; great aſſurance of his love, goodnrſs, and the light of his countenance, to carry and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us with comfort and dependance upon him in them; and hath given us admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Examples, which are as ſo many Commentaries and Expoſitions upon them, and to ſhew us what he means and intends in them and by them: As the examples of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and People; the examples of his beſt Saints and Servants, and their ſufferings, and the reaſons of them, and their deportment under them, and wherein they failed, and wherein they benefited by them; as <hi>Abraham, Job, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, David, Hezekiah, Joſiah,</hi> and all the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50399:83"/>Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians: in whom we may with great clearneſs and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction obſerve how much advantage they got by their afflictions; what loſſes they we are at by their peeviſhneſs, frowardneſs and diſcontent with their afflicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; what comfort, ſatisfaction, and benefit they attained by their patience, quietneſs, equality of mind, voluntary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Divine Providence, and contentation with their eſtates, though never ſo troubleſom and uneaſie.</p>
            <p>But above, all the bountiful God hath brought Life and Immortality to light through the Goſpel: He hath given us the cleareſt conviction imaginable that this world, and our life in it, is not our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal End and Scope, but the place of our Pilgrimage, at beſt our Inn, not our home; our place of tryal and preparation for a better ſtate: He hath ſhewed us that it is but our paſſage, and ſuch a paſſage as muſt and ſhall be accompanied with afflictions, and, it may be, with perſecution by evil men, evil Angels, evil occurrences: that it is the place of our warſare; a troubleſom and tumultuous ſtormy Sea, through which we muſt paſs before we come to our Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: that our Countrey, our home, our place of reſt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ppineſs, lies on the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50399:83"/>other ſide of death, where there ſhall be no ſorrow, nor trouble, nor fears, nor dangers, nor afflictions, nor tears, but a place of eternal and unchangeable comfort, fulneſs of moſt pure and uninterrupted pleaſures, and that for evermore: that through many tribulations and afflictions we muſt enter into that Kingdom, as his ancient People entred into their <hi>Canaan</hi> through a red Sea, a tireſom and barren Wilderneſs, firey Serpents, wants, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and unintermitted dangers and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties: that our light afflictions, which are here but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. Our afflictions and incoveniences in this world, 1. are light in compariſon of that exceeding, far more exceeding weight of glory: 2. As they are but light, ſo being compared with that eternal weight of glory, they are but for a moment: The longeſt life we here live is not ordinarily above threeſcore and ten years, and though the more troubleſom and uneaſie that life is, the longer it ſeems, yet compared with the infinite abyſs of Eternity, it is but a moment, yea leſs than a moment, if leſs can be, yet ſuch is the longeſt ſtay in this life if compared with Eternity.</p>
            <p>And the gracious God hath preſented
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50399:84"/>this greateſt, and moſt important truth to us, with the greateſt evidence and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the moſt deſponding and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitious Soul can deſire. 1. He hath given his own Word of Truth to aſſure us of it. 2. He hath given his own Son, to ſeal it unto us, by the moſt powerful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidence imaginable; by his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Heaven on purpoſe to tell us it; by his Miracles; by atteſtations from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by the laying down his own Life in witneſs of it; by his Reſurrection and Aſcention; by the miraculous Miſſion of his Holy Spirit viſibly and audibly. Again, 3. He hath confirmed it to us, by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Miracles of his Apoſtles; by their Death and Martyrdom; as a Witneſs of the Truth they taught; by the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Converts, and Primitive Chriſtians, and godly Martyrs, who all lived and dyed in this Faith, and for it; who made it their choice rather to ſuffer afflictions with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, declaring plainly that they ſought a better City and Countrey, that is, a heavenly, <hi>Heb. 11.15, 25.</hi> and this Countrey, and this City they had in their Eye, even whiles they lived in this troubleſom world: And this proſpect, this hope, and expectation, rendred this lower
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50399:84"/>world of no great value to them, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures thereof they eſteemed but low and little, and the troubles and uneaſineſs thereof they did undergo patiently, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and contentedly; for they looked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, and placed their hopes, their treaſure, their comfort above them: And even whiles they were in this life, yet they did, by their faith and hope, antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate their own happineſs, and enjoyed by faith, even before they actually poſſeſſed it, by fruition; for <hi>Faith is the ſubstance of things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11. and makes thoſe things preſent by the firmneſs of a ſound perſwaſion, which are in themſelves future and to come.</p>
            <p>And this is that, which will have the ſame effect with us, if we live and believe as they did; and be but firmly, and ſoundly perſwaded of the truth of the Goſpel, thus admirably confirmed unto us. <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</hi> Heb. 10.38. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. We live by faith, and not by ſight; and excellent is that paſſage to this purpoſe, 2 Cor. 4.16, 17, 18. <hi>For which cauſe we faint not, but though our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man periſh, yet our inward man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50399:85"/>far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen, are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen, are eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore if we do but ſeriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth of the Goſpel, the truth of the life to come, the beſt external things of this world will ſeem but of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take up the choiceſt of our deſires or hopes, and the worſt things this world can inflict will appear too light to provoke us to impatience or diſcontent. He that hath but Heaven and everlaſting glory in proſpect and a firm expectation, will have a mind full of contentation in the midſt of the loweſt and darkeſt condition here on Earth. Impatience and diſcontent never can ſtay long with us, if we awake our minds, and ſummon up our faith and hope in that life and happineſs to come. Sudden paſſions of impatience and diſcontent, may like clouds ariſe and trouble us for a while, but this faith, and this hope rooted in the Heart, if ſtirred up, will, like the Sun, ſcatter and diſpell them, and cauſe the light of patience, contentation, and comfort to thine through them.</p>
            <p>And as we have this hope of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and bleſſedneſs ſet before us, ſo <hi>the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50399:85"/>means and way</hi> to attain it is <hi>eaſie and open</hi> to all; no perſon is excluded from it, that wilfully excludes not himſelf. <hi>Iſa. 51.1. Ho every one that thirſteth come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money come ye, buy and eat without money and without price.</hi> Rev. 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take of the waters of life freely.</hi> Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> The way to everlaſting happineſs, and conſequently to contentation here, is <hi>laid open to all.</hi> It was the great reaſon why God made man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to communicate everlaſting happineſs to them; and when they wilfully threw away that happineſs, it was the end why he ſent his Son into the world, to reſtore mankind unto it. And as the way is open to all, ſo it is eaſie to all; his yoak is eaſie and his burthen light. The terms of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining happineſs, if ſincerely endeavoured, are eaſie to be performed, by virtue of that grace, that God Almighry affords to all men, that do not wilfully reject it: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to believe the truth of the Goſpel, ſo admirably confirmed, and ſincerely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obey the precepts thereof, which are both juſt and reaſonable, highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to our contentation in this life, and conſummating our happineſs in the life to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50399:86"/>come: And for our encouragement in this obedience, we are ſure to have, if we deſire it, the ſpecial grace of the Bleſſed Spirit to aſſiſt us, and a merciful Father to accept of our ſincerity, and a gracious Saviour to pardon our failings and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies. So that the way to attain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation in this life, and happineſs in the life to come, as it is plain and certain, ſo it is open and free, none is excluded from it, but it is free and open to all, that are but willing to uſe this means to attain it.</p>
            <p>And I ſhall wind up all this long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe touching Contentation with this plain and ordinary Inſtance. I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid that our home, our Countrey is Heaven and Everlaſting Happineſs, where there are no ſorrows, nor fears, nor troubles; that this World is the place of our travel, and pilgrimage, and at the beſt our Inn: Now when I am in my journey, I meet with ſeveral inconveniencies; it may be the way is bad and foul, the weather tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous or ſtormy; it may be I meet with ſome rough companions, that either turn me out of my way, or all daſh and dirt me in it, yet I content my ſelf, for all will be mended when I come home: but if I chance to lodge at my Inn, there it may be I meet with bad entertainment, the Inn is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50399:86"/>full of gueſts, and I am thruſt into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient lodging, or ill diet, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf, and conſider it is no better than what I have reaſon to expect, it is but according to the common condition of things in that place; neither am I ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to furniſh my lodging with better accommodations, for I muſt not expect to make long ſtay there, it is but my Inn, my place of repoſe for a night, and not my home; and therefore I content my ſelf with it as I find it; all will be amended when I come home. In the ſame manner it is with this world; perchance I meet with an ill and uncomfortable paſſage through it, I have a ſickly Body, a narrow Eſtate, meet with affronts and diſgraces, loſe my friends, companions and relations, my beſt entertainment in it is but troubleſom and uneaſie: But yet I do content my ſelf; I conſider it is but my pilgrimage, my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, my Inn; it is not my countrey, nor the place of my reſt: this kind of uſage or condition is but according to the law and cuſtom of the place, it will be amended when I come home, for in my Father's houſe there are Manſions; many Manſions inſtead of my Inn, and my Saviour himſelf hath not diſdained to be my Harbinger; he is gone thither before me, and gone to prepare
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50399:87"/>a place for me, I will therefore quiet and content my ſelf, with the inconveniencies of my ſhort journey, for my accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be admirable when I come to my home, that heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is the place of my reſt and happineſs.</p>
            <p>But yet we muſt withall remember, that though Heaven is our home, the place of our reſt and happineſs, yet this World is a place for our duty and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and we muſt uſe all honeſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means to preſerve our lives and our comforts by our honeſt care and diligence. As it is our duty to wait the time till our Lord and Maſter calls, ſo it is part of our task in this world given us by the great Maſter of the Family of Heaven and Earth, to be employed for the temporal good of our ſelves and others. It is indeed our principal buſineſs to fit our ſelves for our everlaſting home, and to think of it, but it is a part of our duty and an act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, whiles we are here, to employ our ſelves with honeſty and diligence in our temporal employments: Though we are not to ſet our hearts upon the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this life, yet we are not to reject them, but to uſe them thankfully and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, for they are bleſſings that deſerve our gratitude, though they ought not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50399:87"/>entirely to take up our hearts. Again, though croſſes and afflictions muſt be the exerciſe of our patience, we muſt not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully chooſe them, nor run into them. Let God be ſtill the Maſter of his own Diſpenſation, for he is wiſe, and knows what is fit for us, when we know not what is ſo fit for our ſelves. When he ſends them, or permits them, our duty is patience and contentation, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly our own choice is headſtrong and fooliſh.</p>
            <p>It was the errour of many new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to Chriſtianity, that they thought, that when Heaven and heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was preſſed, that preſently they muſt caſt off all care of the World, deſert their callings, and buſily and unneceſſarily thruſt themſelves into dangers, that ſo they might be quit of all worldly cares and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and of life it ſelf. This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles frequently reprove, and ſhew the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of it, and that juſtly: For the truth of it is, our continuance in this life, and in our honeſt employments and callings, our thankful uſe of external bleſſings here, and our honeſt endeavours for them; the endeavour to do good in our places, ſo long as we continue in them; our prudent prevention of external evils, are part of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50399:88"/>that obedience we owe to our Maker, and part of that exerciſe or task that is given us by him to perform in this life, and our cheerful, faithful, diligent converſation herein, is ſo far from being incompatible to Chriſtianity, that it is a part of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty, and of that ſervice we owe to our Maker; and it is indeed the exerciſe of our patience, and the evidence of a contented mind. For whoſoever preſently grows ſo weary of the World, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, with froward <hi>Jonah,</hi> he wiſheth to dye, or throws off all, it is a ſign of want of that contentation that is here commended: becauſe true Contentation conſiſts in a cheerful and ready compliance with the will of God, and not in a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preference of our own will or choice. It was part of our Saviour's excellent prayer for his Diſciples, <hi>Joh. 17.15. I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them from the evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The buſineſs therefore of theſe Papers is to let you ſee, what are the Helps to attain Patience and Contentation in this World, that our paſſage through it may be ſafe and comfortable, and agreeable to the will of God, and to remedy that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience and diſcontent which is ordinarily
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50399:88"/>ſound among men: To teach men how to amend their lives, inſtead of being weary of them; and to make the worſt conditions in the World eaſie and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, by making the mind quiet, patient and thankful. For 'tis the diſcontented and impatient mind that truly makes the World much more uneaſie than it is in it ſelf.</p>

            <p>There have been doubtleſs many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent underſtandings that have been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about an exact diſquiſition of ſome particular truths, which though as <hi>truths</hi> they agree in a common value with all others, yet in reſpect of their nature, uſe and value, are of no great moment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known or not: As concerning the preciſe time of this or that paſſage in ſuch

Others have ſpent their thoughts in acquiring of the knowledge in ſome ſpecial piece of Nature; the fabrick of the Eye; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of generation in an Egg; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and proportion of Numbers, Weights, Lines; the generation of Metals: and theſe as they have a relative conſideration to diſcover and ſet forth the wiſdom of the great Creator, or to publick uſe, have great worth in them; but in themſelves, though they have this excellence of truth in them, and conſequently in their kind feed and give a delight to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which is a power that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ordained unto, and greedy of, and delighted in truth, though of a low or inferiour conſtitution, yet they are not of that eminence and worth as truths of ſome other, either higher, or more uſeful, or durable nature.</p>
            <p>As once our Saviour, in relation of things to be done, pronounced One thing only neceſſary, <hi>Luk. 10.42.</hi> ſo the Apoſtle,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50399:91"/>among the many things that are to be [known,] fixeth in the ſame One thing neceſſary to be known, Chriſt Jeſus and him Crucified.</p>
            <p>There are three ſteps.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Not to know any thing.</hi> Not as if all <hi>other knowledge</hi> were condemned: <hi>Moſes</hi> learning was not charged upon him as a ſin; <hi>Paul's</hi> ſecular learning was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but uſeful to him; to be knowing in our calling, in the qualities and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of perſons, in the Laws under which we live, in the modeſt and ſober inquiries of Nature and Arts, are not only not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but commended, and uſeful, and ſuch as tend to the ſetting forth the glory of the God of Wiſdom. Even the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Husbandman God owns as his, <hi>Iſa. 28.26.</hi> for his God doth inſtruct him to diſcretion, and doth teach him. But we muſt determine to know nothing <hi>in compariſon of that</hi> other knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus, as the Apoſtle counted what things were gain, yet to be loſs for Chriſt, <hi>Phil. 4.7.</hi> ſo we are to eſteem that knowledge of other things otherwiſe excellent, uſeful, admirable, yet to be but folly and vile in compariſon of the knowledge of Chriſt. And <hi>this requires:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. A true and right Eſtimate of <hi>the Value
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50399:91"/>of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus above other knowledge,</hi> and conſequently an infinite preferring thereof before all other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in our judgments, deſire, and delight; and the preponderation of the knowledge of Chriſt above other knowledges <hi>excells</hi> moſt knowledge in all the enſuing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, but excells all knowledge in ſome, and thoſe of moſt concernment:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In the Certainty</hi> of it. Moſt <hi>other knowledge</hi> [are] either ſuch as we take in <hi>by our Senſe and Experience;</hi> and therein, though it is true, that the groſs part of our knowledge, that is neareſt to our ſenſe, hath ſomewhat of certainty in it, yet when we come to ſublimate, and collect, and infer that knowledge into univerſal or general concluſions, or to make dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ratiocinations, and determinations from them, then we fail, and hence grew the difference between many Philoſophers. Again, the knowledge that we elicit from ſenſe, is but very narrow, if it ſtaid there: for the forms of things, the matter or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is the ſubject of Nature, are not eaſily perceptible by ſenſe; we ſee the colour, and the figure, and the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that, but we do from thence only make conjectures concerning the forms, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>bſtances, and matter: Or they are ſuch
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50399:92"/>as we receive <hi>by Tradition,</hi> whether <hi>histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> or <hi>doctrinal;</hi> and the former depends upon the credit of the relator, which moſt an end depends upon another's credit, and ſo vaniſheth into much incertainty, unleſs the authors be very authentical and eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes: and as to matters <hi>doctrinal,</hi> ſtill that depends upon the opinion of a man, it may be, deduced upon weak convictions, croſſed by perſons of as great judgments, and ſo breeds uncertainty, diſtraction, and diſſatisfaction in the knowledge. But <hi>in the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> we have <hi>greater certainty</hi> than can be found in any of all theſe other Knowledges: 1. A conſtant tradition and reception by millions, before he came, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was to come; and ſince he came, that in truth he is come. 2. The Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that were purpoſely choſen to be witneſſes of Chriſt, his Miracles, Doctrine, Suffering, and Reſurrection. 3. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles he did, that are witneſſed to us, by a greater conſent of teſtimony, than any one part of any Hiſtory of that antiquity. 4. The Purity, Sanctity, and Juſtneſs of his Doctrine, which was never attained unto in the teaching of the Philoſophers, nor ever any could, in the leaſt meaſure, unpeach or blame. 5. The Prophecies,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50399:92"/>ſtiled moſt juſtly by the Apoſtle a more certain evidence, than the very viſion of his Transfiguration, and a Voice from Heaven, 2 <hi>Pet. I.19.</hi> and ſo in truth is a more undeniable argument than any is, for [it] is not capable of any fraud or impoſture. 6. The wonderful prevailing that the knowledge of Chriſt had upon the World, and this not only <hi>de facto,</hi> but backed with a Prophecy, that it ſhould be ſo. 7. The admirable concordance and ſymmetry, that this myſtery of Chriſt makes in the whole method of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of God in the World, as will be caſily obſervable upon the collation of theſe things together: The Creation; the Fall; the Law; the State of the <hi>Jews;</hi> the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul; the Neceſſity of a Satisfaction for Sin if pardoned; the Types and Sacrifices; the Prophecies; the Reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Jews;</hi> the Calling of the Gentiles; the Progreſs of the Goſpel to the new diſcovered parts of the World ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively as diſcovered; that a due colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being made of all theſe and other Conſiderations, it will appear that the doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus, and him crucified, is that which makes the diſpenſtation of God towards the children of men to be all of a piece, and one thing in order to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50399:93"/>ther, and Chriſt the Mediator, in whom God hath gathered together all things in one, <hi>Eph. 1.10.</hi> made it as one Syſtem, Body-fabrick. 8. Beſides the undeniable Prophecies, there bears witneſs to this truth, the ſecret powerful witneſs of the Spirit of God convincing the Soul of the truth of Chriſt, beyond all the Moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions in the world, beyond the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of demonſtration, to believe, to reſt upon, to aſſert it, even unto the loſs of life and all things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As in the certainty, ſo <hi>in the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Eaſineſs of the truth.</hi> The moſt excellent ſubjects of other knowledge have long windings, before a man can come at them; and are of that difficulty and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſeneſs, that as every brain is not fit to undertake the acquiring of it, ſo much pains, labour, induſtry, advertency, aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity is required in the beſt of judgments, to attain but a competent meaſure of it: witneſs the ſtudies of Arithmetick, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, Natural Philoſophy, Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein great labour hath been taken to our hands, to make the paſſage more eaſie, and yet ſtill <hi>are</hi> full of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. But in this knowledge it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: as it is a knowledge fitted for a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal uſe, the bringing of mankind to God,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50399:93"/>ſo it is fitted with a univerſal fitneſs and convenience for that uſe, eaſie, plain, and familiar. <hi>The poor receive the Goſpel,</hi> Matth. 11.5. and indeed the plainneſs of the doctrine was that which made the wiſe world ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at it; and thence it was, that it was hid from the wiſe and prudent, <hi>Matth. 11.25.</hi> who, like <hi>Naaman</hi> with the Prophet, could not be contented to be healed without ſome great oſtentation; nor were contented to think any thing could be the wiſdom of God, and the power of God, unleſs it were ſomewhat that were abſtruſe, and at leaſt conformable to that wiſdom they had; and were troubled to think that that wiſdom or doctrine, that muſt be of ſo great a uſe and end, ſhould fall under the capacity of a Fiſherman, a maker of Tents, a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But thus it pleaſed God to chooſe a Doctrine of an eaſie acquiſition, 1. That no ſleſh ſhould glory in his ſight, 1 <hi>Cor. 1.29.2.</hi> That the way to Salvation, being a common thing propounded to all mankind, might be difficult to none. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and thy ſins be forgiven. Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Believe, and thou ſhalt be raiſed up to Glory.</hi> Joh. 6. 40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son and Believeth on him, may have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:50399:94"/>
            <p n="3">3. As in the Certainty and Plainneſs, ſo <hi>in the Sublimity and Loftineſs of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi> And hence it is that Metaphyſicks is reckoned the moſt noble knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe converſant with and about the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt ſubject, ſubſtance conſidered <hi>in abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> from corporeity, and particular adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents falling under other Sciences. But the ſubject of this knowledge is of the higheſt conſideration: Almighty God; the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his counſel touching man in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the everlaſting condition of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; the true meaſure of juſt and unjuſt; the pure will of God; the Son of God and his miraculous Incarnation, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcention; the great Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between the Eternal God and fallen man made, ſealed, and confirmed in Chriſt his great tranſaction with the Father in their Eternal Counſel; and ſince his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention, in his continual Interceſſion for man; the means of the diſcharge and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of the breach of the Law of God; the ſtate of the Soul after death in bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or miſery; theſe and many of theſe are the ſubject of that knowledge that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the knowledge of Chriſt, ſuch as their very matter ſpeaks them to be of a moſt high nature: the great tranſactions of the counſel and adminiſtration of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50399:94"/>mighty King of Heaven, in his Kingdom over the children of men: ſuch as never fell under the diſcovery, or ſo much as the diſquiſition, of the wiſeſt Philoſophers, and ſuch as the very Angels of Heaven deſire to look down into, 1 <hi>Pet. 1.</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with admiration that manfold wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, which is revealed unto us, poor worms, in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As the matters are wonderful, high, and ſublime, ſo they <hi>are of moſt ſingular Uſe to be known.</hi> There be many pieces of Learning in the World that are converſant about high ſubjects: as, that part of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy concerning the Heaven and the Soul; the Metaphyſicks; the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſer parts of the Mathematicks; that are not in order to practice. But as it may fall out that the knowledge of the ſubject is unacceſſible in any certainty, ſo if it were never ſo exactly known, it goes no farther, and when it's known there's an end, and no more uſe of it. Whereas many times ſubjects of an inferiour nature are more uſeful in their knowledge; as practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Mathematicks, Mechanicks, Moral Philoſophy, Policy; but then they are of an inferiour nature, more uſeful but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance leſs noble. But here is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50399:95"/>that as it is of Eminence and Height, ſo it is of Uſe and Convenience, and that in the higheſt meaſure; as it is a Pearl for Beauty, ſo it is for Value. This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a kind of <hi>Catholicon</hi> of univerſal uſe and convenience. In reference to this life: Am I in Want, in Contempt, in Priſon, in Baniſhment, in Sickneſs, in Death? This knowledge gives me Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs, Patience, Cheerfulneſs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of my ſelf to his will, who hath ſealed my Peace with him, and Favour from him, in the Great Covenant of his Son; and I can live upon this, though I were ready to ſtarve; when I am aſſured that if it be for my good and the glory of his Name, I ſhall be delivered; if not, I can be contented, ſo my Jewel, the Peace of God and my own Conſcience, by the Blood of Chriſt be ſafe. Am I in Wealth, Honour, Power, Greatneſs, Eſteem in the world? This knowledge teacheth me Humility, as knowing from whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>it;</hi> Fidelity, as knowing to whom I muſt account for it; Watchfulneſs, as knowing the Honour of my Lord is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in ſome meaſure in my carriage, and that the higher my employment is, the more obnoxious I am to temptation from without, from the that watch for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50399:95"/>my halting, and from within, by a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart: And in all it teacheth me not to overvalue it, nor to value my ſelf the more by it or for it; becauſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus preſents me with a continual object of a higher value, the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt: it teacheth me to look upon the glory of the World as ruſt, in compariſon of the glory that excelleth, and the greateſt of men as worms, in compariſon of the great God. And as thus in reference to the temporal condition of my life, this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt is of ſingular uſe, and makes a man a better Philoſopher than the beſt of Morals in reference thereunto: So it guides me in the management of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: 1. To God; it preſents him unto me in that repreſentation that is right, full of Majeſty, yet full of Love, which teacheth me Reverence and yet Acceſs with boldneſs, Love and Obedience. 2. To Man; Juſtice, giving every man his due, for ſo the knowledge of Chriſt teacheth me, Do as ye would be done by; Mercy, to forgive; Compaſſion, to pity; Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to relieve; Sobriety, in the uſe of creatures, and yet Comfort in the enjoying of them; a right uſe of the World, and yet a contempt of it, in compariſon of my
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50399:96"/>hope: It makes death not terrible, becauſe a moſt ſure paſſage to life: Here I find a way to get all my ſins pardoned, whereas without this, all the world cannot contrive a Satisfaction for one; I find a way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a righteouſneſs as is valuable with God, and perfect before him, even the righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt. And here I find, the means, and only means, to avoid the wrath to come, the terrour of the judgment of the great day; Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life unto all Eternity, with the Bleſſed God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and all the bleſſed Angels, and the Spirits of juſt men made perfect. Thus this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is uſeful for this life, and [that which is] to come, and that in the higheſt degree; which all other knowledge comes ſhort of, and attains not to any one of the leaſt of theſe ends.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>In the Duration and Continuance of it.</hi> Many ſubjects of knowledge there are, wherein by time, or at leaſt by death, the knowledge proves unuſeful, or at leaſt, the labour therein unprofitable and loſt. For inſtance, I ſtudy to be very exact in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophy, the mixtures or conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of qualities, elements, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch enquiries: What uſe will this be, when the World with the works
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50399:96"/>thereof, ſhall be burnt up? Or if it ſhould not, what great benefit would this be to a ſeparated Soul? which doubtleſs ſhall either know much more therein, without any pains, and ſo the labour here loſt, or in ſhall be ſuch a knowledge as will [be] unconſiderable or unuſeful to it: And ſo, and much more for the ſtudies of Policy, Methods of War, Mechanical Experiments, Languages, Laws, Cuſtoms, Hiſtories, <hi>all</hi> theſe within one minute after death will be as uſeleſs as the knowledge of a Taylor or Shoomaker: they are all dated for the convenience and uſe of this life, and with it they vaniſh. But here is the priviledge and advantage that this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath; as it ſerves for this life, ſo it ſerves for that to come; and the more it is improved here, the more ſhall it be dilated hereafter; the higher meaſure thereof I attain here, the greater meaſure of glory hereafter. As the more knowledge I have of the myſtery of Chriſt here, the greater is my ſight and admiration of the wiſdom, and goodneſs, and love of God; the greater my joy, and complacence, and delight in that ſight and ſenſe, and the more my Soul carried out in the love, and praiſe, and obedience unto him: So in the life to come, that knowledge ſhall improve, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50399:97"/>the ſenſe of the wiſdom, mercy, and love of God; and conſequently the flame of the Soul, of love, and praiſe unto him, and delight, and joy in him, ſhall increaſe unto all eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As thus the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus and him crucified excells all other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſo in compariſon thereof, all other knowledge, upon a right judgment, is as nothing; ſo <hi>the Soul</hi> being <hi>rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thereof, ſets a higher price upon</hi> that knowledge, than upon all other knowledge beſides; it priſeth it highly in it ſelf and others; reckons all other knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, but a curious ignorance, or an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent knowledge, and contents it ſelf abundantly in this knowledge, though it want other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe that which is of moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment requires my greateſt diligence to attain it, I am contented and <hi>greedy to ſpend more time in attaining this</hi> than that; and I will rob other ſtudies and diſquiſitions of the time, that otherwiſe might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to attain the knowledge of them, rather than thoſe ſtudies ſhould conſume that time, that ſhould be allotted to this. My Time is part of that Talent, which my Maker hath put into my hand, and for which he will at the great day demand an
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50399:97"/>account; and if I have ſpent that talent in unprofitable employments, or in leſs profitable than I ſhould, my arrear is ſo much the greater: If I have conſumed my time in ſtudying my preferment, honour, or wealth in this world; in ſtudying how to pleaſe my ſelf with vain and unneceſſary recreations; in unlawful or exceſſive plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; in unlawful or immoderate curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which I might better have ſpent in the ſtudy of the myſtery of Chriſt, or the conformity unto that Will and Teſtament he left me, or improving my intereſt in him, I have committed two follies at once: 1. Loſt my talent of time and opportunity, for which I am accountable, as miſpent. 2. Loſt that advantage which I had in my hand to improve my intereſt in God, and favour from him, and love to him; and though I have done ſo much, as may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance preſerve the main, yet I have omitted ſo much as might have more increaſed my ſtock of Grace and Glory; my talent might have gained ten, and at moſt it hath gained but two. And ſurely when death comes, the moſt comfortable hours, that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our memories, will be thoſe we ſpent in improving the true and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental practical knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus, and him crucified.</p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:50399:98"/>
            <p n="4">4. Conſequently where this knowledge and the other knowledge of an inferiour rate juſtle and croſs one another, it is the beſt wiſdom to <hi>ſide with this,</hi> and to deny the other; to become a fool that he may be wiſe. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus concerning the firſt Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: I determined not to know any thing, <hi>viz.</hi> nothing in compariſon of this knowledge of Chriſt, nothing rather than not that: <hi>Save Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And truly well might the Apoſtle make all other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge give place to this; firſt, for the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of it, whereof before: ſecondly, for the <hi>Amplitude</hi> and <hi>Compaſs</hi> of it; for though it [be] ſo excellent, that a ſmall dram of it is ſufficient to heal and ſave a Soul, if it be a right knowledge as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved, yet it is ſo large, that when the beſt knowledge hath gone as far as it can, yet there is ſtill <hi>aliquid ultra:</hi> One conſideration of it, even the Love of God hath a bredth, and length, and depth, and height, paſſing knowledge, <hi>Eph. 3.18, 19.</hi> and yet there be other depths and heights in it than this, ſo that well might the Apoſtle conclude as he doth, 1 <hi>Tim. 3.16. Without controverſie great is the mystery of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the preſent we ſhall conſider,</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:50399:98"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Wonderful Wiſdom of God in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and ordering the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and [it] is manifeſt in theſe particulars among others: 1. That though he made Man the eminenteſt of all his viſible Creatures, for a moſt eminent manifeſtation of his power and glory, and to be partaker of everlaſting bleſſedneſs, and yet in his Eternal Counſel reſolved to leave him in the hands of his own liberty, and did moſt certainly foreſee that he would fall; yet he did ſubſtitute and provide, even from the ſame Eternity, a means whereby he might be reſtored to the honour and glory of his creature, and his creature to bleſſedneſs and [the] viſion of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. 2. That he ſo ordered the means of man's Redemption, that a greater glory came even by that Redemption, that if man had never faln, and a greater benefit to mankind: For the latter it is apparent, that, if there had been no Mediator ſent, the leaſt ſin that any of the ſons [of] men had committed, had been inexorably fatal to them, without any means of pardon: And as <hi>Adam,</hi> though in his full liberty and power, was miſled by temptation, ſo might have he been, or any of his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity though he had ſtood that ſhock; which now is admirably provided againſt, by the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50399:99"/>ſatisfaction of Chriſt Jeſus: And as thus it is better with the children of men, ſo the glory of God is wonderfully advanced by it; for, if man had ſtood in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, God had had only the glory of his juſtice in rewarding him; or, if he had faln, the glory of his juſtice in puniſhing him: but there had been no room for that glorious attribute of his Mercy in forgiving, without violation to his Purity, Truth and Juſtice; that glorious attribute by which he ſo often proclaimeth himſelf, <hi>Exod. 34.6. The Lord, the Lord God Merciful, Gracious, Long-ſuffering, abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, keeping Mercy for thouſands, forgiving ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, tranſgreſſion and ſin, and</hi> yet <hi>that will by no means clear the guilty.</hi> 3. That he ſo wonderfully ordered the Redemption of Man, that all his Attributes were preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inviolable: His Truth, <hi>The day thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye;</hi> his Juſtice, yet his Mercy; his Love to his creature, yet his Hatred to Sin: his Son ſhall dye to ſatisfie his Truth and Juſtice, yet the ſinner ſhall live, to ſatisfie his Mercy: the ſin ſhall be puniſhed, to juſtifie his Purity, yet his creature ſhall be ſaved, to manifeſt his Love and Goodneſs. And thus his Wiſdom over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled Sin, the worſt of evils, to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his glory, and the good of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50399:99"/>his creature. 4. His wiſdom is manifeſted in this, that by the redemption of man, all thoſe ways of his adminiſtration before the coming of Chriſt, do now appear to be excellently ordered to the redemption of man, and the making of it the more effectual: The giving of a ſevere and yet moſt juſt Law, which was impoſſible for us to fulfil, ſhews us the wretchedneſs of our condition; our inability to fulfil, what was juſt in God to require, ſhews us the neceſſity of a Saviour, drives us to him, and makes this City of refuge grateful and acceptable, and makes us ſet a value upon that mercy, which ſo opportunely and mercifully provided a Sacrifice for us in the Blood of Chriſt; and a Righteouſneſs for us, in the Merits of Chriſt; and a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for us in the Interceſſion of Chriſt: And by this means alſo all thoſe Sacrifices, and Ceremonies, and Obſervations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the Levitical Law, which carried not in themſelves a clear reaſon of their inſtitution, are now by the ſending of Chriſt rendred ſignificant. 5. The wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is magnified and advanced in this, in fulfilling the Prophecies of the ſending the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to ſatisfie for the ſins of Mankind, againſt all the oppoſitions, and caſualties, and contingencies that without
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50399:100"/>an over-ruling wiſdom and guidance might have diſappointed it: And this done in that Perfection, that not one circumſtance of Time, Place, Perſon, Concomitants ſhould, nor did fail in it: and ſo bearing witneſs to the infinite <hi>Truth, Power,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God in bringing about his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in their perfection, touching this great buſineſs of the Redemption of Man, which was the very end why he was created and placed upon the earth; and managing the villany of men, and the craft and malice of Satan, to bring about that greateſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that was or could be provided for mankind, beſides, and above, and againſt the intention of the Inſtrument. <hi>Act. 2.23. Him being delivered by the determinate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi> 6. The unſearchable Wiſdom of God is manifeſted in that he provided ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator that was fit for ſo great a work; had all the world conſulted that God muſt ſuffer, it had been impoſſible; and had all the world contrived that any man, or all the men in the world ſhould have been a ſatisfactory Sacrifice for any one Sin, it had been deficient. Here is then the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Counſel of the moſt high God: the Sacrifice that is appointed ſhall be ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50399:100"/>that God and Man ſhall be conjoyned in one Perſon; that ſo as Man, he might become a Sacrifice for Sin; and as God, he might give a value to the Sacrifice. And this is that great Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The wonderful Love of God to Mankind:</hi> I. In thinking upon poor ſinful creatures, to contrive a way for a Pardon for us, and reſcuing us from that Curſe which we had juſtly deſerved: 2. Thinking of us for our good, when we ſought it not, thought not of it: 3. When we were enemies againſt God, and againſt his very being: 4. Thinking of us not only for a Pardon, but to provide for us a ſtate of Glory and Bleſſedneſs: 5. When that was not to be obtained, ſaving his Truth and Juſtice, without a miraculous Mediator, conſiſting of the divine and humane nature united in one perſon, in the Perſon of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; here was Love and Goodneſs of the greateſt magnitude that ever was, or ever ſhall be heard of, and ſufficient to conquer our Hearts into admiration and aſtoniſhment. But yet it reſts not here. As <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life: Joh.</hi> 3.16. ſo the only begotten Son of God
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50399:101"/>was not behind in this wonderful Love. No ſooner (as we may with reverence ſay) was the Counſel of the Father propounded for the ſending of his Son, but preſently the Son ſaith; <hi>Lo, I come.</hi> Pſal. 40.7. Heb. 10.7. And now we will conſider upon [what] terms he muſt come, or elſe the redemption of mankind muſt dye for ever: I. He muſt come and empty himſelf of his Glory of his perſonal Majeſty, and take our nature, yet without ſin; he muſt go through the natural infirmities of infancy and childhood. 2. And not only muſt he undergo this abaſement, but he muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the condition of a mean, a low birth, born of a poor Virgin, in a Stable, laid in a Manger, under the reputation of a Carpenter's Son. 3. And not only thus, but as ſoon as he is born, muſt uſe the care of his Mother to ſhift for his life away to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to prevent the jealouſie and fury of <hi>Herod.</hi> 4. And when grown up to youth, he muſt undergo the form of a Servant, become a poor Carpenter to work for his living, without any patrimony or ſo much as a houſe to cover him. 5. He comes abroad into the World to exerciſe the Miniſtry, and the Prologue to his own Tragedy; ſtill poor, deſpiſed of his own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and of thoſe that were of reputation
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50399:101"/>for Learning and Piety, ſcandalized under the name of an Impoſtor, a Winebibber, a friend to Publicans and ſinners, a worker by the Devil, mad and poſſeſſed with a Devil: Theſe and the like were his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in the World; and, which is more, often put to ſhift for his life; and in ſum, what the Prophet predicted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him fulfilled to the uttermoſt: <hi>Iſa; 53.3. Deſpiſed, and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief;</hi> and all this to befall the Eternal Son of God under the vail of our fleſh: And all this voluntarily undertaken, and cheerfully undergone, even for the ſakes of his Enemies, and thoſe very people from whom he received theſe indignities.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But all theſe were but like ſmall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litations, and conflicts preparatory to the main Battel. We therefore come to <hi>the Third Conſideration:</hi> Chriſt Jeſus and him <hi>Crucified;</hi> there is the account of the Text: As Chriſt Jeſus is the moſt worthy ſubject of all knowledge, ſo Chriſt Jeſus under this conſideration, as Crucified, is that which is the fulleſt of wonder, admiration, love: And therefore let us now take a ſurvey of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus crucified;</hi> as that is the higheſt manifeſtation of his love, ſo it is the eye, the life of the Text; Chriſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50399:102"/>above all other knowledge, and Chriſt Crucified above all other knowledge of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And now a man upon the firſt view would think this kind of knowledge ſo much here valued, were a ſtrange kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and the prelation of this knowledge a ſtrange miſtake in the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified:</hi> Death is the corruption of nature; and ſuch a kind of death by crucifixion, the worſt, the vileſt of deaths; carrying in it the puniſhment of the loweſt condition of men, and for the worſt of offences; and yet, that death, and ſuch a death ſhould be the ambition of an Apoſtle's knowledge, is wonderful. 2. <hi>Chriſt crucified</hi> carries in it a ſeeming exceſs of incongruity; that he, that was the Eternal Son of God, ſhould take upon him our nature, and in that nature annointed and conſecrated by the Father, full of Innocence, Purity, Goodneſs, ſhould dye, and that by ſuch a death, and ſo unjuſtly: Could this be a ſubject, or matter of knowledge ſo deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as to be preferred before all other knowledge? which ſhould rather ſeem to be a matter of ſo much horrour, ſo much indignation, that a man might think it rather fit to be forgotten, than to be affected to be known. 3. <hi>Jeſus crucified;</hi> a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50399:102"/>and yet to be crucified: it ſeems to blaſt the expectation of Salvation; when the Captain of it muſt dye, be ſlain, be crucified; it carries in it a kind of victory of death and hell over our ſalvation, when the inſtrument thereof muſt ſuffer death, and ſuch a death. When the Birth of Chriſt was proclaimed, indeed it was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of joy, and worthy the proclamation of Angels: <hi>Luke 2.12. To you is born this day a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord:</hi> and can the death of that Saviour be a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable to be known? The Birth of Chriſt ſeemed to be the riſing Sun, that ſcattered light, hope and comfort to all Nations: but can the ſetting of this Sun in ſo dark a cloud, as the Croſs, be the choiceſt piece of knowledge of him? which ſeems as it were to ſtrangle and ſtifle our hopes; and puts us as it were upon the expoſtulation of the diſmay'd Diſciples, <hi>Luke 24.21. But we truſted it had been he which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for all this, this knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus crucified will appear to be the moſt excellent, comfortable, uſeful knowledge in the world, if we ſhall conſider <hi>theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</hi> 1. Who it was that ſuffered. 2. What he ſuffered. 3. From whom. 4. How he ſuffered. 5. For whom he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50399:103"/>ſuffered. 6. Why, and upon what Motive. 7. For what End he ſuffered. 8. What [are] the fruits and Benefits that accrew by that ſuffering. All theſe <hi>Conſiderations</hi> are wrapt up in this one ſubject; Chriſt Jeſus and him crucified.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Who it was that thus ſuffered.</hi> It was Chriſt Jeſus the Eternal Son of God, cloathed in our fleſh; God and Man united in one Perſon; his manhood giving him a capacity of ſuffering, and his Godhead giving a value to that ſuffering; and each nature united in one perſon to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Redeemer; the Heir of all things; <hi>Heb. 1.2.</hi> the Prince of Life; <hi>Acts 3.15.</hi> the Light that lighteneth every man that cometh into the world; <hi>Joh. 1.9.</hi> as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Divine nature, God over all bleſſed for ever; <hi>Rom. 9.5.</hi> and as touching his Humane nature, full of Grace and Truth; <hi>Joh. 1.14.</hi> and in both, the beloved Son of the Eternal God, in whom he proclaimed himſelf well pleaſed; <hi>Math. 3.17.</hi> But could no other perſon be found, that might ſuffer for the ſins of Man, but the Son of God? Or if the buſineſs [of] our Salvation muſt be tranſacted by him alone, could it not be without ſuffering, and ſuch ſuffering as this? No. As there was no other Name given under Heaven, by which
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50399:103"/>we might be ſaved, nor was there any found beſides, in the compaſs of the whole World, that could expiate for one ſin of man; but it muſt be the Arm of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that muſt bring Salvation: <hi>Iſa. 63.5.</hi> So if the Bleſſed Son of God will undertake the buſineſs, <note place="margin">Heb. 5.9.</note> and become the Captain of our Salvation, he muſt be made perfect by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; <hi>Heb. 2.10.</hi> and if he will ſtand in the ſtead of man, he muſt bear the wrath of his Father: if he [will] become ſin for man, though he knew no ſin, he muſt become a curſe for man. And doubtleſs this great myſtery of the perſon that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, cannot chooſe but be a very high, and excellent ſubject of knowledge; ſo full of wonder and aſtoniſhment, that the Angels gaze into it: And as it is a ſtrange and wonderful thing in it ſelf, ſo doubtleſs it was ordained to high and wonderful ends, bearing a ſuitableneſs unto the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the inſtrument. This therefore is the firſt Conſideration that advanceth the excellency of this knowledge; the perſon that was Crucified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What he ſuffered.</hi> Chriſt Jeſus and him crucified: though all the courſe of his life was a continual ſuffering, and the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or walk unto his death, which was
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50399:104"/>the end of his life; yet this was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting of all the reſt; and the tyde and waves of his ſufferings did ſtill riſe higher and higher, till it arrived in this: and the ſeveral ſteps and aſcents unto the Croſs, though they began from his Birth; yet thoſe which were more immediate, began with the preparation to the Paſſover. The Council held by the chief Prieſts and Scribes, for the crucifying of our Saviour, was ſate upon two days before the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Matth. 26.2. Mark 14.1.</hi> and this was the firſt ſtep to Mount <hi>Calvary:</hi> And doubtleſs it was no ſmall addition to our Saviour's Paſſion, that it was hatched in the Council of the chief Prieſts and Scribes, the then external viſible Church, the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen of the Vineyard: <hi>Matth. 21.33.</hi> But this is not all; as the viſible Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> is the Conclave where this Council is formed, ſo <hi>Judas</hi> a member of the viſible Church of Chriſt, one of the Twelve, is the Inſtrument to effect it; <hi>Matth. 26.14.</hi> he contracts with them for Thirty pieces of Silver, to betray his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto them: And ſurely this could not chooſe but be a great grief to our Saviour, that one of his ſelect Apoſtles ſhould turn Apoſtate, and thereby brought a blemiſh upon the reſt.</p>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:50399:104"/>
            <p>Upon the day of Eating of the Paſſover, called the firſt day of the Feaſt of unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread, our Saviour and his Diſciples keep the Paſſover together in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and there the two memorials of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Paſſion meet: that of the Paſſover inſtituted by God, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> going out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and the Bread and Wine after Supper inſtituted by our Saviour, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the place of the former: and each did queſtionleſs make a deep impreſſion upon our Saviour, in which he anticipated his Paſſion, and lively repreſented to him that breaking and pouring out of his Blood and Soul, which he was ſuddenly to ſuffer: And doubtleſs here began a great meaſure of our Saviour's Paſſion in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which he had of that imminent Storm, that he muſt ſpeedily undergo. From the Supper they go together to the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> and there he acquaints his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of a ſpeedy and ſorrowful parting they muſt have; the Shepherd is to be ſmitten that night, and the Sheep to be ſcattered: and as he foreſaw <hi>Judas</hi> treachery, ſo he foreſees <hi>Peter's</hi> infirmity; the ſtorm ſhould be ſo violent that <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteſt Apoſtle, ſhall deny his Maſter that night, and deny him thrice: And ſurely the foreſight of the diſtraction that ſhould
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50399:105"/>befall his poor Diſciples, could not chooſe but add much to their tender Maſter's affliction; <hi>Matth. 26.31. All ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let us follow our Bleſſed Lord from the Mount of <hi>Olives</hi> into the Garden, called by the Apoſtles <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> with the affections of love and wonder in ſome meaſure becoming ſuch an entertainment of our thoughts. The Time that he choſe for this retirement was the dead time of the night; a ſeaſon that might the more contribute to the ſtrength of that ſadneſs, which the pre-apprehenſion of his immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Paſſion muſt needs occaſion. The Place that he choſe, a ſolitary retired Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where nothing might, nor could interrupt, or divert, the intenſiveneſs of his ſorrow and fear: And to make both the time and place the more opportune for his Agony, he leaves the reſt of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and takes with him only <hi>Peter</hi> and the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee, Matth. 26.37.</hi> and to theſe he imparts the beginning of his ſorrow, that they might be witneſſes of it, <hi>Matth. 26. 37, 38. My ſould is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſorrowful, even unto death;</hi> but yet commands their diſtance, <hi>verſ. 38. Tarry ye here and watch with me, and he went a little further. Watch with me:</hi> The confuſion
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50399:105"/>of his Soul was ſo great, that the only Son of God diſtruſts his own [humane] ability to bear it; and yet his ſubmiſſion to this terrible conflict [was] ſo willing, that he leaves them that he had appointed to watch with him. <hi>He went a little farther.</hi> The three Diſciples had doubtleſs a ſympathy with their Maſter's ſorrow; and yet the will of God ſo orders it, that their exceſs of love and grief muſt not keep their Eyes waking, notwithſtanding it was the laſt requeſt of their ſorrowful Maſter. <hi>The diſciples ſlept.</hi> Matth. 26. 40. And thus every circumſtance of Time, Place, and Perſons contribute to a ſad and ſolitary opportunity for this moſt terrible and black conflict. And now in this Garden the mighty God puts his Son to grief, lades him with our ſorrows, <hi>Iſa. 53.4.</hi> withdraws and hides from him the light of his favour and countenance; interpoſeth a thick and black cloud between the Divinity and the humane nature; darts into his Soul the ſad and ſharp manifeſtations of his wrath; overwhelms his Soul with one wave after another; ſends into him the moſt exquiſite pre-apprehenſions of thoſe ſad and ſevere ſufferings he was the next day to undergo; begins to make his Soul and Offering for Sin, and heightens his ſorrow, confuſion,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50399:106"/>and aſtoniſhment unto the uttermoſt. In ſum, the mighty God, the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, who knows the way into the Soul, and how to fill it with the moſt ſad and black aſtoniſhment and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, was pleaſed at this time to eſtrange and eclipſe the manifeſtation of his light and love to his only Son, as far as was poſſibly conſiſtent with his ſecret and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal love unto him; to throw into him as ſad and amazing apprehenſions of his wrath, as was poſſible to be conſiſtent with the humane nature to bear; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie and ſtrengthen his ſenſe of it and ſorrow for, and under it, unto the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, that ſo his grief and ſorrow and confuſion of ſoul might be brim-full, and as much as the exacteſt conſtitution of a humane nature could poſſibly bear. And thus now at this time the Arm of the mighty God was bruiſing the Soul of his only Son; <hi>Iſa. 53.16.</hi> And certainly the extremity of this agony within, muſt needs be very great, if we conſider the ſtrange effects it had without: 1. That pathetical deſcription thereof that our Saviour himſelf makes of it; <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death,</hi> Matth. 26.37. ſo ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, exceeding ſorrowful, ſorrowful unto death: and the expreſſions of the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50399:106"/>
               <hi>Matth. 26.37. He began to be ſorrowful and very heavy,</hi> Mark 14.33. <hi>He began to be ſore amazed and to be very heavy.</hi> It was ſuch a ſorrow as brought with it an amazement, an aſtoniſhment. 2. Again, that ſtrange requeſt to his three Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Tarry ye and watch with me;</hi> as if he feared the ſorrow would overwhelm him. 3. Again, his Prayer, and the manner of it, evidence a moſt wonderful perturbation within; <hi>Matth. 26.39. He fell on his face and prayed;</hi> and what was the thing he prayed? <hi>Father if it be poſſible let this cup paſs from me;</hi> Or, as <hi>Mark 14.36. Abba, Father, all things are poſſible unto thee, take away this cup from me,</hi> &amp;c. although that this was the very end for which he came into the World; the Cup which in former times he reached after, and was ſtraitned till it were fulfilled; yet ſuch a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation there is thereof to his Soul, that though, in the will of his obedience, he ſubmits; <hi>Not my will but thine be done:</hi> Yet his nature ſhrinks and ſtarts at it; and he engageth Almighty God, as much as, upon as great arguments, as was poſſible, to decline the ſeverity of that wrath which he was now to grapple with: 1. Upon the account of his Omnipotency; <hi>All things are poſſible to thee:</hi> 2. Upon the account
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50399:107"/>of his Relation; <hi>Abba, Father:</hi>
               <q>It is not a ſtranger that importunes thee; it is thy Son; that Son in whom thou didſt proclaim thy ſelf well pleaſed; that Son whom thou heareſt always; it is he that begs of thee; and begs of thee a diſpenſation from that, which he moſt declines, becauſe he moſt loves thee, the terrible, unſupportable hiding thy face from me:</q> And this was not one ſingle requeſt, but thrice repeated, reiterated and that with more earneſtneſs, <hi>Mark 14.39. And again he went away, and prayed, and ſpake the ſame words:</hi> Luke 22.44. <hi>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly.</hi> Certainly, that impreſſion upon his ſoul, that cauſed him to deprecate that for which he was born, to deprecate it ſo often, ſo earneſtly, muſt needs be a ſorrow and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a very terrible and exceeding extremity. 4. Such was the weight of his ſotrow and confuſion of ſoul, that, it even exceeding the ſtrength of his [hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane] nature to bear it, it was ready to diſſolve the Union between his Body and Soul; inſomuch that to add farther ſtrength unto him, and capacity to undergo the meaſure of it, an Angel from Heaven is ſent, not [meerly] to comfort, but to ſtrengthen him; to add a farther degree
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50399:107"/>of ſtrength to his humane nature, to bear the weight of that wrath, which had in good earneſt made his Soul ſorrowful unto death, had it not been ſtrengthned by the miniſtration of an Angel, <hi>Luk. 22.43.</hi> and this aſſiſtance of the Angel, as it did not allay the ſorrow of his Soul, ſo neither did it intermit his importunity to be delivered from the thing he felt and feared, but did only ſupport and ſtrengthen him to bear a greater burden of it: And as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his ſtrength was increaſed, ſo was the burden which he muſt undergo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; for aſter this he prayed again more earneſtly the third time, <hi>Luk. 22.43.</hi> the ſupply of his ſtrength was ſucceeded with an addition of ſorrow, and the increaſe of his ſorrow was followed with the greater importunity; <hi>He prayed more carneſtly,</hi> Heb. 5.7. <hi>With ſtrong crying and tears,</hi> Luk. 22. 44. <hi>And being in an agony be prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</hi> This was his third addreſs to his Father, <hi>Matth. 26.44.</hi> and here was the higheſt pitch of our Saviour's paſſion in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. His Soul was in an agony, in the greateſt concuſſion, conſuſion, and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſorrow, fear, anguiſh and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that was poſſible to be inſlicted by
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50399:108"/>the mighty hand of God on the ſoul of Chriſt, that could be conſiſtent with the purity of the nature of our Saviour, and the inſeparable union that it had with the Divine nature: Inſomuch, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſtraction of his ſoul under it, and the ſtrugling and grapling of his ſoul with it, did make ſuch an impreſſion upon his body, that the like was never before or ſince. The ſeaſon of the year was cold; for ſo it appears, <hi>Joh. 18.18.</hi> the Servants and Officers had made a fire of coals, for it was cold: and the ſeaſon of the time was cold, it was, as near as we may gueſs, about midnight, when the Sun was at his greateſt diſtance, and obſtructed in his influence by the interpoſition of the Earth: for it appears they came with Lanthorns and Torches when they apprehended him, <hi>Joh. 18.3.</hi> and he was brought to the high Prieſt's Hall, a little before Cock-crowing, after ſome time had been ſpent in his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>Math. 26.69.</hi> And yet for all this, ſuch is the agony, and perturbation of our Saviour's ſoul, that in this cold ſeaſon it puts his body in a ſweat, a ſweat of blood, great drops of blood, drops of blood falling down to the ground; and certainly it was no light conflict within, that cauſed ſuch a ſtrange and un-heard of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50399:108"/>ſymptom without. Certainly the ſtorm in the ſoul of Chriſt muſt needs be very terrible that his blood, the ſeat of his vital ſpirits, could no longer abide the ſenſe of it, but ſtarted out in a ſweat of blood, and ſuch a ſweat, that was more than conſiſtent with the ordinary conſtitution of humane nature. And during this time, even from the eating of the Paſſover until this third addreſs to his Father was over, the ſuffering of our Saviour lay principally, if not only, in his ſoul. Almighty God was wounding of his ſpirit, and making his ſoul an offering for ſin: And though the diſtinct, and clear manner of this bruiſing of our Saviour's ſoul cannot be apprehended by us; yet ſurely thus much we may conclude concerning it: 1. <hi>He was made ſin for us, that knew no ſin,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. he ſtood under the imputation of all our ſins; and though he were perſonally innocent, yet judicially and by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, he was the greateſt offender that ever was; for the Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all. <hi>Iſa. 53.6.2.</hi> And conſequently he was under the imputation of all the guilt of all thoſe ſins, and ſtands, in relation unto God, the righteous Judge, under the very ſame obligation to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever puniſhment the very perſons of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50399:109"/>offenders were, unto the uttermoſt of that conſiſtency that it had with the unſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable union unto the Father: and this obligation unto the puniſhment could not chooſe but work the ſame effects in our Saviour, as it muſt do in the ſinner, (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation and ſin excepted;) to wit, a ſad apprehenſion of the wrath of God againſt him. The purity and juſtice of God, which hath nothing that it hates but ſin, muſt purſue ſin wherever it find it: and as when it finds ſin perſonally in a man, the wrath of God will abide there ſo long as ſin abides there; ſo when it finds the ſame ſin aſſumed by our Lord, and bound as it were to him, as the wood was to <hi>Iſaac</hi> when he was laid upon the Altar, the wrath of God could not chuſe but be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended as incumbent upon him, till that ſin that by imputation lay upon him were diſcharged. For as our Lord was pleaſed to be our Repreſentative in bearing our ſins, and to ſtand in our ſtead, ſo all theſe affections and motions of his ſoul did bear the ſame conformity, as if acted by us: As he put on the perſon of the ſinner, ſo he puts on the ſame ſorrow, the ſame ſhame, the ſame fear, the ſame trembling under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the wrath of his Father, that we muſt have done: And ſo as an imputed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50399:109"/>ſin drew with it the obligation unto pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, ſo it did, by neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, raiſe all thoſe confuſions and ſtorms in the ſoul of Chriſt, as it would have done in the perſon of the ſinner, ſin only excepted. 3. In this Garden as he ſtands under the ſin, and guilt of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo he ſtands under the curſe of our nature, to wit, a neceſſity of death, and of undergoing the wrath of God for that ſin whoſe puniſhment he hath undertaken for us: the former, the diſſolution of his body and ſoul by a moſt accurſed death, and the latter the <hi>ſuffering of his ſoul;</hi> and this <hi>latter</hi> he is now under. God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to inflict upon him all the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of his wrath, and to fling into his ſoul the ſharpeſt and ſevereſt repreſentations of his diſpleaſure that might poſſibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him under that bare imputed guilt, conſidering the dignity of his Perſon. And ſurely this was more terrible to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour than all his corporal ſufferings were: under all thoſe not one word, no pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation at all, but as a Sheep before his ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth: but the ſenſe of the diſpleaſure of his Father, and the impreſſions that he makes upon his ſoul, thoſe he cannot bear without ſorrow, even unto death, without
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50399:110"/>moſt importunate addreſſes to be delivered from them, and a moſt ſtrange concuſſion and agony upon his ſoul and body under the ſenſe of them. And the actual mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the wrath of God upon his Son conſiſted in theſe two things princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Filling his ſoul with ſtrange and violent fears and terrors, inſomuch that he was in an amazement and conſternation of ſpirit; the Paſſion-Pſalm renders it, <hi>Pſal. 22.14. My heart is like wax, it is melted in the midſt of my bowels:</hi> the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, that knows how to grind and bruiſe the ſpirit, did bruiſe and melt his ſoul within him with terrors, fears, and ſad pre-apprehenſions of worſe to follow.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſenſible withdrawing, by haſty and ſwift degrees, the light of the preſence and favour of God: He is ſorrowful and troubled, and he goes to his Father to deſire it may paſs from him, but no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; he goes again, but yet no anſwer; and yet under the preſſure and extremity; he goes again the third time with more earneſtneſs, agony, a ſweat of blood; yet no, it cannot be; and this was a terrible condition, that the light of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Father is removed from his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50399:110"/>Son, his only Son, in whom he was well pleaſed, his Son whom he heard always: And when he comes to the Father under the greateſt obligation that can be, with the greateſt reverence, with the greateſt importunity; once, and again, and a third time; and that, filled within with fears, and covered without with blood; and yet no anſwer, but all light and acceſs and favour intercepted, with nothing but blackneſs and ſilence: Certainly this was a terrible Cup, yet thus it was with our Saviour Chriſt; The light of the favour of God, like the Sun in an Eclipſe, from the very inſtitution of the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be covered one degree after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and in the third addreſs to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Garden, it was even quite gone: But at that great hour, when our Saviour cryed <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> then both lights, that greater light of the favour of God to his only Son, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the light of the Sun, ſeemed to be under a total receſs, or Eclipſe; and this was that which bruiſed the ſoul of our Saviour, and made it an Offering for Sin; and this was that which wrung drops of blood from our Saviour's body, before the Thorns, or the Whips, or the Nails, or the Spear, had torn his veins.</p>
            <pb n="200" facs="tcp:50399:111"/>
            <p>And now after this third application for a deliverance from this terrible Cup of the wrath of God, and yet no diſpenſation obtained, he returns to his miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters, the three Diſciples; and he finds them the third time aſleep: Theſe very three Diſciples were once the witneſſes of a glorious Transfiguration of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the Mount, and in an extaſie of joy and fear, they fell on their faces, <hi>Matth. 17.6.</hi> and now they are to be witneſſes of a ſad Transfiguration of their Lord under an agony and ſweat of blood; and now under an extaſie of ſorrow they are not able to watch with their [Lord] one hour. Our Saviour calls them, but whiles they were ſcarce awakened, they are rouzed by a louder alarm, <hi>Matth. 26.47. whiles he yet ſpake, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude, with ſwords and ſtaves from the high Prieſts,</hi> Joh. 18.3. <hi>with lanthorns and torches:</hi> And though this was little in compariſon of the ſtorm that was in our Saviour's ſoul; yet ſuch an appearance, at ſuch a time of the night, and to a perſon under ſuch a ſad condition, could not but be terrible to fleſh and blood; eſpecially, if we conſider the circumſtances that attended it. 1. An Apoſtle, one of the twelve, he it is that conducts this
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50399:111"/>black Guard, <hi>Matth. 25.47. Whomſoever I ſhall kiſs, that ſame is he, hold him faſt;</hi> one that had been witneſs of all his Miracles, heard all his divine Sermons, acquainted with all his retirements; he, whoſe feet his Maſter with love tenderneſs had waſhed, who within a few hours before had ſupped with him, at that Supper of of ſolemnity and love, the Paſſover: this is he that is in the head of this crew: certainly this had in it an aggravation of ſorrow to our Bleſſed Saviour, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by a Diſciple. 2. The manner of it, he betrays him by a kiſs; an emblem of homage and love is made uſe of to be the ſignal of ſcorn and contempt, as well as treachery and villany. 3. Again, the carriage of his Diſciples, full of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and yet of cowardize; they ſtrike a Servant of the high Prieſt, and cut off his Ear, <hi>Matth. 26.57.</hi> which, had not the meekneſs and mercy of our Saviour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a miraculous cure, might have added a blemiſh to the ſweetneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of his ſuffering: He rebukes the Raſhneſs of his Diſciple, and cures the wound of his Enemy: again, of Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, <hi>Matth. 26.56. Then all the diſciples forſook him and ſled;</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, that but now had profeſſed the reſolution of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50399:112"/>his love to his Maſter, follows, but a far off, <hi>Matth. 26.58.</hi> in the poſture and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a ſtranger and a ſpectator. So ſoon was the love and honour of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, deſerved by ſo much love, and purity, and miracles, loſt in the Souls of the very Diſciples.</p>
            <p>After this he is brought to the high Prieſts, the ſolemn aſſembly of the then viſible Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the perſons of the greateſt reverence and eſteem among them, the high Prieſts, Scribes and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and before them accuſed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of thoſe crimes that might render him odious to the <hi>Jews, Romans,</hi> and all good men, Blaſphemy, and by them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced worthy of death, <hi>Matth. 26.66.</hi> and after this, expoſed to the baſeſt uſage of the baſeſt of their retinue; the Servants ſpit on him, buffet him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to ſcorn, ſaying, <hi>Propheſie unto us, thou Chriſt, who is he that ſmote thee, Matth. 26.67.</hi> injuries leſs tollerable than death to an ingenuous nature: and, to add to all the reſt, <hi>Peter</hi> inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the inſolence of the abjects, and bearing a part with his Maſter in his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, thrice denying his Maſter, and that with an oath, and curſing. So far was he from owning his Maſter in his adverſity,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50399:112"/>that he denied he knew him; and this in the very preſence of our Saviour, <hi>Luk. 22.61. and the Lord turned and looked upon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> certainly that look of our Saviour, as it carried a ſecret meſſage of a gentle reprehenſion, ſo alſo of much ſorrow, and grief in our Lord: as if he ſhould have ſaid, <q>Ah <hi>Peter,</hi> canſt thou ſee thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour thus uſed, and wilt thou not own me? Or if thou wilt not, yet muſt thou needs deny me, deny me thrice, deny me with oathes, and with execrations? The unkindneſs of a Diſciple, and ſuch a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that haſt been privy to my Glory in my Transfiguration, and to my Agony in the Garden, cuts me deeper than the ſcorns and deriſion of theſe abjects. But that's not all, this apoſtacy of thine, theſe denials, theſe oathes, theſe execrations, will lye heavy upon me anon, and add to that unſupportable burden that I am under; the Thorns, and the Whips, and the Nails, that I muſt anon ſuffer, will be the more envenomed by theſe Sins of thine; and thou caſteſt more gall into that bitter Cup, that I am drinking, than all the malice of mine enemies could do. In ſum, though thou goeſt out, and weepeſt bitterly, yet theſe Sins of thine would ſtick unto thy Soul unto eternity,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50399:113"/>if I ſhould not bear them for thee; they coſt thee ſome tears, but they muſt coſt me my blood</q>.</p>
            <p>The next morning the high Prieſts and Elders hold a ſecond conſultation, as ſoon as it was day, <hi>Luk. 22.66.</hi> their malice was ſo ſollicitous, that they prevent the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sun; and after they had again exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him, and in that Council charged him with Blaſphemy, the Council and the whole multitude lead him bound to <hi>Pilate;</hi> and there they accuſe him, and, to make their accuſation the more gracious, charge him with Sedition againſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> and though he had no other advocate but ſilence and innocence, for he anſwered them nothing; yet the Judge acquits him, <hi>Luk. 23.23. I find no fault in him;</hi> and yet, to ſhift his hands of the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to gratifie an adverſary, he ſends him to <hi>Herod,</hi> and his accuſers follow him thither alſo, <hi>Luk. 23.10.</hi> the chief Prieſts and Scribes vehemently accuſe him: <hi>Herod</hi> when he had ſatisfied his curioſity in the ſight of Jeſus, to add to the ſcorn of our Saviour, expoſeth him to the deriſion of his rude Souldiers, and cloathes him in a gorgeous Robe, and remands him to <hi>Pilate.</hi> Thus in triumph and ſcorn he is ſent from place to place: firſt to <hi>Annas;</hi> then to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50399:113"/>
               <hi>Caiphas;</hi> then convented before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Prieſts; then ſent into the high Prieſt's Hall; then re-convened before the Council; then ſent bound to <hi>Pilate;</hi> and from thence to <hi>Herod;</hi> and from him back again to <hi>Pilate:</hi> and in all thoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from place to place, expoſed unto, and entertained with new ſcorns, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſions, and contempts.</p>
            <p>At his return to <hi>Pilate,</hi> he again the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time declares his Innocence; that neither he nor <hi>Herod</hi> found any thing worthy of death, <hi>Luk. 23.15.</hi> and yet to gratifie the <hi>Jews,</hi> he offers to have him ſcourged, whom he pronounceth innocent; yet to avoid the groſs injuſtice of a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death offers to releaſe him, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their cuſtom; but this could not not ſatisfie: To preſerve their cuſtom, and yet to fulfil their malice, they chooſe the reprieve of <hi>Barabbas</hi> a murderer, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune the crucifying of the innocent Jeſus; and now the third time <hi>Pilate</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth him innocent, <hi>Luk. 23.22.</hi> and yet delivers [him] over to be crucified. The Executioners did it to the uttermoſt, and, and to add pain and ſcorn to his ſcourging, put upon him a Crown of thorns: and in this diſguiſe of blood and contempt, he brings him forth, ſhews him
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:50399:114"/>to his proſecutors, <hi>Joh. 19.5. Behold the man;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, <q>You <hi>Jews,</hi> that that have accuſed this man, muſt know I find no fault in him, yet to ſatisfie your importunity, I have delivered him over to the ſevereſt and vileſt puniſhment next unto death, Scourging and Scorn; here he is, ſee what a ſpectacle it is, let this ſatisfie your Envy</q>. But all this will not ſerve, there is nothing below the vileſt of deaths can ſatisfie; all cry out, Crucifie him: and when yet the Judge profeſſeth he finds nothing worthy of death, they impoſe a Law of their own; <hi>We have a law, and by our law he ought to dye, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God.</hi> But when this rather made the Judge the more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, they engage him upon his fidelity to <hi>Caſar</hi> his Maſter: He that maketh himſelf a King, ſpeaketh againſt <hi>Caſar:</hi> But all this was not enough; but at length the importunity of the Prieſts and people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed: and <hi>Pilate</hi> who had been before warned by the monition of his Wife, and had theſe ſeveral times pronounced him innocent, yet againſt the conviction of his own Conſcience, to ſatisfie and content the <hi>Jews,</hi> adds this farther cruelty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to what he had before done, gave ſentence that it ſhould be as they required,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50399:114"/>
               <hi>Luk. 23.24.</hi> delivered him over to that curſed and ſervile death of Crucifixion: and yet his perſecutors malice and envy not ſatisfied; but, after his judgment, purſue the execution of it with as great malice, ſcorn, and cruelty, as they had before uſed in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it: His Crown of thorns upon his head; a purple Robe upon his body; the Blood of his ſcourging and thorns all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his viſage; a Reed in his right hand; and the baſe and inſolent multitude with ſpittings, and ſtrokes, and reproaches, abuſing him, till his Croſs be ready: and then the purple Robe is taken off, and he conducted to the place of his Execution; and, to add torment to his ſhame, our Bleſſed Lord, wearied with an agony and long watching the night before; and from the time of his apprehending hurried from place to place; and his blood and ſpirits ſpent with the ſcourging, and thorns, and blows; and, which is more than all this, a ſoul within laden with a weight of ſorrow, and the burden of the wrath of God, which did drink up and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his ſpirits: yet, in this condition, he is fain to bear his burdenſom Croſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place of his Execution, <hi>Joh. 19.17.</hi> till he was able to carry it no longer, but even fainted under it; and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50399:115"/>then <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> is compelled to bear it to the place.</p>
            <p>When he comes to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he is ſtript ſtark naked, and his clothes afterwards divided by lot among the Souldiers, <hi>Matth. 27.35.</hi> and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked body ſtretched upon the Croſs to the uttermoſt extenſion of it, <hi>Pſal. 22.17. I may tell all my bones, they look and ſtare upon me:</hi> and at the uttermoſt extenſion, which the cruel Executioners could make of our Saviour's body, his hands and his feet nailed to that Croſs, with great Nails through thoſe tender parts full of nerves and arteries, and moſt exquiſitely ſenſible of pain. And in this condition the Croſs with our Saviour's body is raiſed up in the view of all; and, that even in this his execution, that the ſhame and ignominy of the manner of his death might have a farther acceſſion of ſcorn and reproach, he is placed between two Thieves, that were crucified with him, with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of deriſion upon his Croſs, in all the moſt univerſal Languages of the World, <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin;</hi> and the people and Prieſts ſtanding by with geſtures and words of deriſion, <hi>Matth. 27.39, 43.</hi> and, even to a letter, aſſuming thoſe very geſtures and words, which were
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50399:115"/>ſo many hundreds of years predicted in the Paſſion-Pſalm 22.78. <hi>He truſted in God, let him deliver him, if he will have him;</hi> and one of thoſe very Thieves, that was even dying as a malefactor, yet was filled with ſuch a deviliſh ſpirit, that he upbraids and derides him.</p>
            <p>And now our Saviour is under the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſhame of this curſed execution: but, though theſe his ſufferings of his body and outward man, were very grievous, in ſo much that it could not but extremely afflict him; yet it is ſtrange to ſee how little he was tranſported under them, in all his contumelies, reproaches and accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſcarce a word anſwered: He anſwered them nothing in all his abuſings, ſtrokes, ridiculous garments, crown of thorns, tearing of his body with ſcourging; yet not a word; but, <hi>As a ſheep before the ſhearers is dumb, ſo he opened not his mouth; Iſa.</hi> 53.7. in all his rackings upon the Croſs, and nailing of his limbs to it, and all the anguiſh that, for the ſpace of ſix hours, from the third hour, wherein he was crucified, <hi>Mar. 15.25.</hi> until the ninth hour, wherein he gave up the ghoſt, <hi>Matth. 27.46.</hi> not a word of complaint; but he refuſed thoſe very ſupplies which were uſually given to ſuppreſs the violence of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50399:116"/>the pain, vinegar and gall. <hi>Matth. 27.34.</hi> But when we come to the Afflictions of his Soul, they were of a higher dimenſion in the Garden when no other ſtorm was upon him, but what was within him: He falls down upon his face and prayes; and again; and a third time; and is ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ſorrowful to death; and ſweats drops of blood: and doubtleſs whiles he was under the reproaches, and buffetings, and whippings, and thorns, he was not without a terrible and confuſed ſadneſs and heavineſs within, which though they did not mitigate the torments of his body, yet they did infinitely exceed them. The ſpirit and the ſoul is moſt exquiſitely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and it is that which feels the pains inflicted upon the body. Certainly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wound of the ſpirit it ſelf, the fountain of ſenſe, muſt needs be exceedingly grievous: And hence it was, that though all the injuries and torments of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour could ſcarce wring a complaint from him, yet the weight of that wrath that lay upon his ſoul, now made an offering for ſin, did wring from him thoſe bitter and terrible cryes, that one would wonder ſhould proceed from him, that was One with the Father; <hi>Matth. 27.46. My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> From
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50399:116"/>the ſixth hour to the ninth darkneſs was over all the land, <hi>Matth. 27.45.</hi> ſuch a darkneſs as bred an aſtoniſhment even in ſtrangers and other Counties. The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the World, though a ſuitable dreſs for ſuch a time wherein the Son of God muſt dye, and the Sun of Righteouſneſs be eclipſed; yet it was nothing in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that diſmal ſhadow, that covered our Saviour's ſoul all this time. About the ninth hour our Saviour cryed that bitter cry, <hi>My God, my God why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> manifeſting the depth of his ſorrow, and the perfect ſenſe he had of it; <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> more could not have been ſuffered or been ſaid; every word carries in it an accent of horror. <q>
                  <hi>Thou,</hi> that art the great God, from whom, and in whom every thing hath its being and comfort; ſurely if in thy preſence is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of joy, in thy withdrawings muſt be fulneſs of horror, and confuſion; and yet it is thou that haſt forſaken me. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken:</hi> Hadſt thou never been with me, as I had not known the bleſſedneſs of thy fruition, ſo I could not have mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the extremity of my loſs; the exceſs of the happineſs that I had in thy preſence, adds to the exceſs of my miſery in the ſuffering of thy abſence. Forſaken me:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:50399:117"/>not withdrawn thy ſelf to a diſtance, but forſaken me; and forſaken me at ſuch a time as this, when I ſtand more in need of thy preſence than ever; when I am forſaken of my countrey-men, of my kindred, of my Diſciples: then to be forſaken of thee, when I am under the ſhame, and pains of a cruel, and a curſed death; under the ſcorns, and deriſions of thoſe that hate me; under the weight, and preſſure of all the ſins of the world; under the ſtruglings with terrors in my ſoul, ſent from thy mighty hand; under the viſible approach of death, the king of terrors; under a vail of darkneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and the ſeeming triumph of the power of darkneſs within; then to be forſaken, and forſaken of thee, whom I had only left to be my ſupport. <hi>Forſaken Me:</hi> It is not a ſtranger that thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakeſt; it is thy Son; thy only Son; in whom thou didſt heretofore proclaim thy ſelf well pleaſed: that Son whom though thou now forſakeſt, yet forgets not his duty unto thee, nor dependance upon thee; but ſtill layes hold on thee: and though thou ſhakeſt me off, yet I muſt ſtill [call] upon thee, with the humble confidence of My God, My God ſtill. <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> To be forſaken, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50399:117"/>to be forſaken of God, of my God; of him that is not only my God, but my Father; and that at ſuch a time; and yet not to know why.</q> Oh bleſſed Saviour, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that ſpake by thy own Spirit did tell thee why: and that very Pſalm, out of which thou takeſt this bitter cry, doth tell thee why: and thou thy ſelf within ſome few days, or hours before, didſt tell us why; and doſt thou now ask why? Didſt thou not chooſe even that which thou now groaneſt under; and wert willing to put thy ſoul in our ſouls ſtead, and bear the ſin of thoſe which are now thy burden? Certainly we may, with all humility and reverence conceive, that at the time of this bitter cry, our Saviour's ſoul was, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, over-ſhadowed with ſo much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and ſorrow, that it did for the preſent over-power and cover the actual and diſtinct ſenſe of the reaſon of it; at leaſt in that meaſure and degree in which he ſuffered. This cry of our Saviour was about the ninth hour, a little before his death; and having fulfilled one Prophecy in this terrible cry, contained in the very words of <hi>Pſal. 22.</hi> he fulfills another; he ſaith, I thirſt, <hi>Joh. 19.28.</hi> and preſently they give him vinegar to drink. And <hi>between this and his death there intervene
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:50399:118"/>theſe paſſages:</hi> 1. His proclaiming to the world, that the work of our Redemption was finiſhed; <hi>Joh. 19.30. When he received the vinegar, he ſaid, It is finiſhed.</hi> 2. A ſecond cry with a loud voice, <hi>Matth. 27.50.</hi> the words are not expreſſed of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cry; only both Evangeliſts, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> teſtifie it was a cry with a loud voice; to evidence to the world that, in the very article of his giving up of the ghoſt, the ſtrength of nature was not wholly ſpent, for he cryed with a loud voice. 3. The comfortable reſignation of his ſoul unto the hands of his Father, <hi>Luk. 23. 46. Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit:</hi> And although, but even now the black ſtorm was upon his ſoul, that made him cry out with that loud and bitter cry, yet the cloud is over, and with comfort he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers up his ſoul into the hands of that God, whom he thought, but even now, had forſaken him. It is more than probable that that bitter cry was uttered at the very Zenith of all his pains, and when he had taken the vinegar, and proclaimed that it is finiſhed; though they were all wrapt up in a very ſmall time, about the end of the ninth hour, yet now there remained no more, but for him to give up his ſpirit, which he inſtantly thereupon did, <hi>Joh.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50399:118"/>19.30. He ſaid, It is finiſhed, he bowed the head, and gave up the ghoſt.</hi> Now the <hi>things wonderfully obſervable in the death of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> are many. 1. That it was a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary delivering up of his ſpirit: this is that which he ſaid, <hi>Matth. 10.18. No man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it from me, but I lay it down: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again: this commandment have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of my Father.</hi> And truly this volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary delivering up of his ſoul, was well near as great an evidence of his Divinity, as his reſuming it again: ſo that this very delivering up of his ſoul converted the Centurion, <hi>Mar. 15.39. When he ſaw that he ſo cryed and gave up the ghoſt, he ſaid, Truly this man was the Son of God.</hi> Now that he thus voluntarily gave up his ſpirit is evident; 1. By the ſtrength of nature, that was yet upon him, in the very article of his death, he cryed with a loud voice: 2. That the Thieves, who were crucified at the ſame time, dyed not till there was a farther violence uſed by breaking their legs, <hi>Joh. 19.32.</hi> [but] he expired to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the violence of the Souldiers, and to fulfill the type and prophecy; <hi>Not a bone of him ſhall be broken.</hi> Joh. 19.36.3. That the ſuddenneſs of his death cauſed admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in thoſe, that well knew the lingring
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:50399:119"/>courſe of ſuch a death; in the Centurion, <hi>Mar. 15.39.</hi> in <hi>Pilate,</hi> Mar. 15.44. which might probably be the cauſe that the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Souldier, to ſecure the aſſurance of his death, pierced his ſide with a ſpear, <hi>Job. 19.34.</hi> and thereby fulfilled that other Scripture which he never thought of. <hi>Job. 15.37.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>the wonderful occurrences that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied our Saviour's death</hi> were very many, and conſiderable. 1. A ſtrange, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Fulfilling of the Prophecies, and Types,</hi> that were concerning our Saviour's death, and the very individual circumſtances that attended it; and all to conſirm our Faith, that this was indeed the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that he was thus delivered over to death, by the moſt certain and pre-determinate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God: The Time of his Death ſo exactly predicted by <hi>Daniel,</hi> ch.9.v.25, 26. the parallel circumſtances with the Paſchal Lamb, <note place="margin">Iſa. 53.7.</note> in the nature of him, a Lamb without ſpot, <hi>Exod. 12.5.</hi> in the time of his delivery over to death, at the Feaſt of the Paſſover, and the very evening wherein the Paſſover was to be eaten: In the Manner of his Oblation, not a bone to be broken, <hi>Exod. 12.46.</hi> again, the Manner of his Death, by piercing his hands and his feet, <hi>Pſal. 22.16.</hi> the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50399:119"/>very Words uſed by him, <hi>Pſal. 22.1. Matth. 27. 46.</hi> the Words uſed of him, <hi>Pſal. 22.8. Matth. 27.43.</hi> the crucifying of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Malefactors, <hi>Iſa. 53.12.</hi> the Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, <hi>Iſa. 53.5.</hi> the Dividing of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and caſting Lotts upon his Veſture, <hi>Pſa. 22.18.</hi> the Thirſt of our Saviour upon the Croſs; and the giving him Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Gall, <hi>Pſal. 69.21.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſtrange and miraculous <hi>Concuſſion of nature,</hi> giving teſtimony to the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, and unheard of diſſolution of our Saviour's body and ſoul; Darkneſs from the ſixth hour until the ninth hour. And it is obſervable in the night wherein he was born, by a miraculous light the night became as day, <hi>Luk. 2.9.</hi> but at his death, a miraculous darkneſs turned the day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to night for three hours; <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.45. at his birth, a new Star was created to be the lamp and guide unto the place of his birth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.9. but at his death, the Sun in the firmament was masked with darkneſs, and yielded not his light, while the Lord of life was paſſing into the vail of death. Again, another prodigy that accompanied the death of Chriſt was an Earthquake, that rent the rocks, and opened the graves, and ſtrake amazement and conviction into the Centurion, that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50399:120"/>was watching him, <hi>Math. 27.52, 53, 54.</hi> When our Saviour was entring into the earth by death, the earth trembled; and ſo it did when he was coming out of it by his Reſurrection. <hi>Matth. 28.2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, the Graves were opened, and the <hi>dead bodies of the Saints aroſe:</hi> As the touch of the bones of <hi>Eliſha</hi> cauſed a kind of reſurrection, 2 <hi>Kings 13.21.</hi> ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's body, new ſaln to the earth, did give a kind of particular reſurrection to the Saints bodies, to teſtifie that by his death he had healed the deadlineſs of the Grave, and that the ſatisfaction for Sin was accompliſhed, when Death, the wages of Sin, was thus Conquered.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, <hi>the Vail of the Temple</hi> was <hi>Rent</hi> in twain from the top to the bottom, <hi>Matth. 27.57.</hi> the Vail was that, which divided the moſt holy place from the reſt of the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod. 26.33.</hi> and in that moſt Holy place were contained the myſterious Types, the Ark of the Covenant, and the Mercy-Seat; and within this Vail only the high Prieſt entred once a year, when he made an atonement for the People and for the Tabernacle, <hi>Levit. 16.33. Heb. 9.7.</hi> and now at our Saviour's death, this vail was rent, from the top to the bottom; and it <hi>imported divers very great Myſteries:</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:50399:120"/>1. That now our great High Prieſt was entring into the moſt holy, with his own blood, having thereby made the atonement for us; <hi>Heb. 9.12. By his own blood, he entred once into the moſt holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</hi> 2. That the Means, whereby he entred into the moſt holy place, was by the Rending of his Humanity, his ſoul from his body, typified by the rending of that vail; and therefore his fleſh, that is, his whole humane nature, was the vail, <hi>Heb. 10.20. Conſecrated through the vail, that is, his fleſh.</hi> 3. That now by the death of Chriſt all thoſe dark Myſteries vailed up formerly in the moſt holy, the Ark of the Covenant, and the Mercy-Seat, are now rendred open, and their Myſteries unfolded. Chriſt, the Mediator of the Covenant, and the Seat of Mercy and Acceptation, unto all believers founded and ſeated upon him, and thereby that Life and Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which was wrapt up in the myſteries of the Old covenant, and yet thoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries vailed, and incloſed up, within the vail, is now brought to light through the Goſpel, <hi>2 Tim. 1.10.</hi> and the vail rent in twain, that as well the meaning of thoſe myſteries and types under the Law is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. 4. That now the uſe of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law is at an end, the greateſt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:50399:121"/>and moſt ſacred myſtery of the Tabernacle, and indeed of the whole ceremonial Law, was this that was within the vail, the moſt holy place, wherein were the moſt holy and revered myſteries, the Ark and the Mercy-Seat: But now the vail is rent, the uſe aboliſhed, the covenant of the people is given; the Body of Chriſt, typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Temple, ſeparated, and ſo the uſe of the other Temple, Tabernacle and the holy Places, Veſſels, Inſtruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ceaſed. 5. That now the Kingdom of Heaven, the moſt Holy Place, is open unto all believers: Chriſt our High Prieſt is entred in with his own blood, and hath not cloſed the vail after him, but rent it in ſunder, and made and left a paſſage for all believers to follow him, with our prayers and acceſs to the glorious God, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in our perſons; <hi>Heb. 10.19, 20. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore bloldneſs to enter into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt, by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way, which he bath conſecrated for us, through the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh; let us draw near with a true heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now we have gone thus far with our Lord unto his death, we ſhall follow him to <hi>his Grave. Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> having an honorable mention by all four Evangeliſts, <hi>Matth. 27.57.</hi> a rich man,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50399:121"/>and Jeſus diſciple; <hi>Mar. 15.43.</hi> an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Counſellor, who waited for the Kingdom of God; <hi>Luk. 23.50</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, a good man and a juſt, who had not conſented to the counſel or deed of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and waited for the Kingdom of God; <hi>Joh. 19.38.</hi> a diſciple of Chriſt, but ſecretly for fear of the <hi>Jews:</hi> this man manifeſted his faith, and love to his Maſter, when he was in his loweſt condition; goes to <hi>Pilate</hi> boldly, and begs his Saviour's body; he wraps it in a clean linnen cloth, laid it in a Tomb provided for himſelf, and hewed out of the rock, and rolled a great ſtone upon the door of the Sepulchre. And as by his death with the malefactors, ſo by his burial in this rich man's Sepulchre, he fulfilled both parts of the Prophecy, <hi>Iſa. 53.9. He made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death.</hi> The high Prieſts continued their malice, and their jealouſie, even againſt the dead body of our Saviour; and, to ſecure themſelves againſt the ſuſpition of his Reſurrection the third day, take order for making the Sepulchre ſure, till the third day was paſt, <hi>Matth.27.60.</hi> they ſeal the ſtone and ſet a watch. And it is very Obſervable, how the almighty Counſel of God made uſe of the very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and jealouſie of theſe people, for the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:50399:122"/>confirming of his own truth, Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and our Faith; Their malicious and curious induſtry, to prevent the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of a fictitious Reſurrection, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly and uncontrollably convincing the reality of our Saviour's death and true Reſurrection. He is laid in the grave the evening of the day wherein he ſuffered; a Stone rolled upon the mouth of the grave, ſuch as required a conſiderable ſtrength to remove it, inſomuch that the women that came the firſt day of the week to embalm the body, were in a great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty how it ſhould be removed; <hi>Mar. 16.3.</hi> for it was a Great ſtone; <hi>Matth. 27.60.</hi> and this ſtone Sealed: and, as if all this were too little, and the bonds of death and the grave were too weak, they add a Watch of Souldiers to ſecure the body. <hi>Matth 27.66.</hi> And here we leave for a while our Saviour's body interred with Spices, <hi>Joh. 19.39.</hi> in a new Sepulchre, wherein never before any lay, <hi>Joh. 19.41.</hi> hewen out of a rock in the garden, <hi>Joh. 19.42.</hi> that as in the garden, death at firſt laid hold of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> undergoes the ſtate of death, and gains the victory over the grave: his agony in a garden, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrment in a garden; his body reſts in the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:50399:122"/>grave, and his ſoul tranſlated into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; for ſo he witneſſed of himſelf, <hi>This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> Luk. 23. 43. For at the inſtant of his diſſolution our Satisfaction was made; and the work of our Redemption, ſo far as it depended upon his ſuffering, finiſhed: So that had it not been for a witneſs of the reality and truth of his death, and of the power and reality of his Reſurrection, and the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the decree of God, manifeſted in the Scriptures, he might have reaſſumed life in the next inſtant after his death: For the debt to the Juſtice of God was fully ſatisfied, and his continuance in the grave until the third day, was not by the power of death which he vanquiſhed in the inſtant of his diſſolution, but a voluntary ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of himſelf unto that ſtate, for the ſtrengthening of our faith, and the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And now we come to the Conſideration <hi>of the Reſurrection</hi> of our Lord; by which he was declared to be the Son of God with power; and by which the fulneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs of our Redemption by him, is abundantly manifeſted. He choſe that Time to dye, when the Paſſover was ſlain; that time wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was created, the ſixth day of the week at even. He choſe that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50399:123"/>time for his body to reſt in the grave, and for his ſoul to reſt in Paradiſe, wherein his Father reſted from all the great work of the Creation; the ſeventh day of the week; and he choſe that day to riſe again, which his Father choſe to begin the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the firſt day of the week; that the ſame day might bear the inſcription of the Creation and of the Reſurrection of the World: and that as in that day the Lord God brought light out of darkneſs, ſo this light, the light that enlightneth every man that comes into the world ſhould ariſe from the land of darkneſs, the grave: <hi>This is the day that the Lord hath made, let us be glad and rejoyce therein.</hi> The Time of the Day, wherein our Lord aroſe, was very early in the morning of the firſt day of the week, as it began to dawn, <hi>Matth 21.1.</hi> while it was yet dark, or ſcarcely full light, <hi>Joh 17.1.</hi> And the Manner of it was full of wonder and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. An Angel from heaven comes down to draw the curtain of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's grave, and with an Earthquake rolls away the ſtone that covered it; the Keepers, who had watchfully obſerved the command of their Commanders, were ſtricken with aſtoniſhment, and became as dead. <hi>Matth. 28.2, 3, 4.</hi> Our Lord
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:50399:123"/>who had power to lay down his life, and power to take it up again, <hi>Joh. 10.17.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumes his body, which though it had taſted death, yet had not ſeen corruption, and ariſeth, and thereby proclaimed the completing of our Redemption; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not poſſible he ſhould be longer holden of it, <hi>Acts 2.24.</hi> his victory over death and the grave for us, 1 <hi>Cor. 15.</hi> When our Lord raiſed up <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he came forth of the grave bound hand and foot with grave-cloaths, <hi>Joh. 11.44.</hi> though he was for the preſent reſcued from death by the power of Chriſt, yet he muſt ſtill be a ſubject to it: he is revived, but yet riſeth with the bonds of death about him; he muſt dye again: But when our Lord riſeth, he ſhakes off his grave-cloaths; the linnen that wrapped his body in one place, and the linnen that bound his head in another, <hi>Joh. 20.6, 7.</hi> Our Lord being riſen, dieth no more; death hath no more power over him. <hi>Rom. 6.9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus we have conſidered the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of Chriſt's Paſſion and Reſurrection, the firſt and ſecond general Conſideration: Who it was that ſuffered; and What it was he ſuffered. The <hi>Third Conſideration</hi> follows.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>From whom he ſuffered</hi> all theſe things,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:50399:124"/>the conſideration of which doth highly advance the Sufferings of Chriſt. 1. He ſuffered this from the hands of his Own Father; it was he, that bruiſed him, put him to grief, made his ſoul an Offering for Sin, <hi>Iſa. 53.10.</hi> it was he, that reached him out this bitter cup to drink, <hi>Joh. 18.11. The cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink?</hi> it was he, that bound that burden ſo cloſe upon him, that made him ſweat great drops of blood in the garden, and though thrice importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a diſpenſation from it, yet would not grant it: it was he, that, when the greateſt extremity of pain and ſorrow lay upon him, to add thereunto, withdrew the ſenſe of his preſence from him, which wrung from him that bitter cry, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The injuries of an Enemy are eaſily born, but the forſakings of a Father are intollerable. 2. The immediate Inſtruments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of his ſuffrerings, were ſuch as had a nearneſs of relation to him; people of the ſame Nation, and his kinſmen accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh; the ſeed to <hi>Abraham;</hi> people of his own Religion; that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the ſame God; acknowledged the ſame Seripture; the viſible Church of God; and chief repreſentatives of that Church; moſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:50399:124"/>eminent in place, reputation, and pretence of holineſs; the chief Prieſts, and Elders, and Scribes: people that he had never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured in his life; but obliged them with his many miraculous cures, his precious and heavenly inſtructions, his tendereſt and deareſt love and compaſſion: That very <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which he wept over, and would have gathered as a hen gathereth her Chicken under her wings, is now that brood that ſeeks the deſtruction of him, that came to ſave them; and in that vile competition offered to them between their Redeemer and a murderer, choſe rather to ſave a malefactor, and to deliver their innocent and merciful Saviour: And theſe were they that, beyond the examples even of common humanity, purſued their Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, their Benefactor, their Redeemer with ſuch exact bitterneſs, and malice, and ſcorn, and cruelty, that as it ſeemed barbarous to the heathen Judge, ſo it hath out-gone the practice of the heatheniſh Tyrants: <hi>Pſal. 55.12. It was not an enemy that reproached me, then could I have born it, but it was thou, mine acquaintance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us conſider <hi>How he ſuffered</hi> all theſe things; and this doth infinitely advance the Excellence and Value of his Suffering. 3. He Suffered <hi>Innocently;</hi> Iſa. 53.9. he
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50399:125"/>had <hi>done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth, yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him:</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. he <hi>made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin:</hi> the companions of his ſuffering juſtifie him, <hi>Luk. 23.41. We indeed juſtly, but this man hath done nothing amiſs:</hi> his Perſecutors juſtifie him; and yet their malice reſted not, but ſought out falſe witneſs againſt him, <hi>Math. 26.60.</hi> and when they themſelves were convinced of their own injuſtice, in proſecution of an innocent, yet what they could not avouch upon the account of juſtice, they do upon the point of expedience; <hi>Joh. 18.14. Caiaphas</hi> gives them counſel, that it was expedient that one ſhould dye for the people: <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed him, juſtified him; <hi>Matth. 24.4. I have ſinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood:</hi> his Judge acquits him; and in a ſignal teſtimony of his judgment, <hi>Matth. 27.24. He took water, and waſhed his hands before the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſaving, I am innocent of the blood of this juſt perſon:</hi> and yet though, in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the ſatisfaction of his judgment, he waſheth his hands in water before them, yet he condemns the perſon that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits, and ſtains thoſe hands in the blood of our Lord, whom yet he pronounceth innocent. And this Innocence of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50399:125"/>was not only a Negative Innocence, an abſence of guilt, but a Poſitive Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; he ſuffered that had not only done no ill, but that had done nothing but good: he healed their ſick, cured their lame, their blind, their deaf, their lepers, caſt out their devils, and, which was more than all this, ſhewed them the way to Eternal Life, to the ſaving of the Souls of many, and the convincing of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all that heard him, <hi>Joh. 7.46. Never man ſpake like this man:</hi> And well might he ask as once he did, upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, For which of all my good works do ye ſtone me, do ye crucifie me? <q>Bleſſed Lord, they crucifie thee for all thy good works: if thou hadſt been guilty, poſſibly thou mighteſt have been ſpared in the ſtead of <hi>Barabbas;</hi> nay if thou hadſt been only innocent, it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thy perſecutors might not have been altogether ſo violent againſt thee: but thou ſufferedſt for the very good thou diddeſt; it was not only an act of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that ſpared not thy innocence, but an improvement of envy that did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign thy very goodneſs.</q>
               <hi>Math. 27.18. For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſuffered all <hi>Patiently;</hi> Iſa. 53.7.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50399:126"/>
               <hi>He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the ſlaughter; and as a ſheep before her ſhearer is dumb, ſo he openeth not his mouth:</hi> Betrayed by his Diſciples, hurried away by the black guard that apprehended him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and vilified by the high Prieſts and Elders, forſaken and denied by his followers, ſtricken, ſpit upon, and baſely injured by the abjects in the high Prieſts Hall, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Herod,</hi> inſulted upon by <hi>Pilate; Knoweſt thou not that I have power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee?</hi> whipt, cloathed in ſcorn with purple, and crowned with a crown of thorns, and in that diſguiſe ſaluted in ſcorn with <hi>Hail King of the</hi> Jews: forced to bear his burdenſom Croſs, which muſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bear him; and then, as one of the baſeſt of men and vileſt of malefactors, nailed to the Croſs with moſt exquiſite torment; and then, by one of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in death, by the general rabble that were about, [him,] by the ſuperſtitious Scribes and Elders, reproached as a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as an impoſtor: and yet in the midſt of all this uſage, ſcarce a word ſpoken, and thoſe that he ſpake, not ſavouring of any impatience, or complaint againſt his perſecutors, but full of mildneſs, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſweetneſs, goodneſs, and whiles his
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50399:126"/>perſecutors are buſie in revilings and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentings, he as induſtrious to pray for them; <hi>Luk. 23.34. Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Which is yet a higher ſtep, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all this <hi>Willingly and Cheerfully:</hi> Joh. 10.18. <hi>No man taketh my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf;</hi> Luk. 12.50. <hi>I have a baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I straitned till it be fulfilled?</hi> and this willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Lord's ſuffering appears in theſe particulars: 1. In that when he had power to prevent it, and to reſcue himſelf from the inſolence of his perſecutors, yet he uſeth it not: one Angel armed by commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God in one night deſtroyed a vaſt Army of the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> and upon the deſire of our Lord no leſs than twelve le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions were ready for his Guard: but yet this muſt not be; <hi>How then ſhall the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures be fulfilled?</hi> Matth. 27.53, 54. When the company that were ſent to apprehend him heard thoſe words, <hi>I am he,</hi> they went backward and fell to the ground, <hi>Joh. 18.6.</hi> the ſame power by which they fell, could have ſo bound them never to have riſen again; but our Lord, though he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted this power to evidence his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet he uſeth it not ſo far as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede his Paſſion; and, as it were, reſumes
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50399:127"/>and calls back that manifeſtation of his Deity, leſt it might be a means to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the ſervice which he was about to perform for mankind. <hi>He asked them again, whom ſock ye?</hi> 2. In that he corrects and checks all things that might be either an impediment of his paſſion, or that might, in the leaſt degree, betray an unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him to undergo it. Doubtleſs there was an adequate repreſentation unto him of the dreadfulneſs of that conflict he was to undergo with the wrath of God, and yet upon all occaſions he corrects that ſear and thoſe ſad apprehenſions which cauſed his humane nature to ſhrink at it; <hi>Job. 12.27. Father, ſave me ſeem this hour, but for this cauſe came I to this hour;</hi> Matth. 26.39. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me; nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt:</hi> That even whiles the infirmity of his humane nature ſtarted at the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of what he was to ſuffer, and prayed againſt it, yet the freeneſs and purity of his obedience carried [him] on to it, and made him, as it were, un-pray what he had before prayed: And though his ſoul ſtartled at the diſcovery of that diſmal vale that he was now to paſs through, yet his love to mankind and his reſolution of obedience to his Father's will carried [him]
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50399:127"/>on with willingneſs to ſuffer that which he [was] troubled to ſee: again, how doth he check all impediments to his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; he foreſeeth ſhame and pain, he arms himſelf againſt both, <hi>Heb. 12.2.</hi> with patience againſt the latter, he endured the Croſs; with reſolution againſt the former, he deſpiſed the ſhame: again, when <hi>Peter</hi> began to play the Politician in adviſing our Lord to decline his ſuffering, how ſeverely doth he take him up? <hi>Get thee behind me; the cup which my Father hath given me to drink, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> again, when the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward zeal of the Diſciple drew his Sword, and cut off a Servant of the high Prieſt's Ear, our Lord checks the aſſailant, and cures the wound; leſt any thing ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard the execution of that thing for which he came into the world, or import the leaſt argument of backwardneſs in him to undergo it. <hi>Matth. 26.52. Joh. 18.11.</hi> It is very obſervable to ſee how <hi>Pilate</hi> was ready to fluctuate upon every occaſion, and ſhiſted from place to place, and from point to point, to decline the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lord: when he anſwered him nothing, he marvelled, and was at a ſtand upon his ſilence, <hi>Matth. 27.14.</hi> when he heard his accuſation to be, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God, he was the more
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50399:128"/>afraid; <hi>Joh. 19.8.</hi> he had ſecret checks from his own Conſcience, and weighty advertiſements from his Wife, that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs did put him to a great perplexity of mind, which was ſcarcely conquerable by the importunity of the <hi>Jews:</hi> And, if in the midſt of this unreſolvedneſs and heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy of mind, our Saviour ſhould in any one anſwer of his [have] ſent forth that majeſty and ſtrength of conviction, that he could eaſily, and upon former occaſions had done, certainly the <hi>Jews</hi> muſt have expected the coming of another deputy to have been the executioner of this purpoſe: But our Lord was ſo far from declining this great work of our Redemption by his blood, that he ſeems purpoſely to decline that majeſty of ſpeech, wherewith he could have confounded his Judge; and either anſwered him with ſilence, or with ſuch expreſſions, as might not too much affright him from the proceeding in that ſad em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; <hi>Joh. 19.11. Thou couldct have no power at all againſt me, unleſs it were given thee of God.</hi> Though he blamed the malice of his accuſers, he admits and aſſerts the authority of his Judge.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us conſider <hi>For whom he ſuffered</hi> all this. 1. <hi>The Perſons</hi> for whom he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>deſerved it not:</hi> The expreſſions of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50399:128"/>the Scripture [are] full in this, <hi>Rom. 5. 7, 8. Peradventure for a good man ſome would even dare to dye; but God commendeth his love towards us in that, while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us;</hi> the objects upon which he looked upon in his ſufferings were darkneſs, <hi>Eph. 5.8. Children of wrath, Eph. 2.3. Aliens from the commonwealth of Iſrael, ſtrangers from the covenant of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world. Epheſ. 2.12.</hi> See but what a monſter the beſt of us were in our natural condition, when every power of our Soul and Body [was] quite corrupted from the uſe and end, for which they were made. <hi>Rom. 3.9, 10, &amp;c. 2.</hi> As it was for thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it not, nor any deliverance by it, ſo it was for a company of creatures that <hi>were no way ſolicitous</hi> for, nor ſought after redemption; ſuch as were ignorant of their own miſery, and no ways endeavouring after mercy. Thus <hi>He was found of them that ſought him not;</hi> and ſurely little ſeeking could be found of ſuch as were in ſuch a condition, <hi>Eph. 2.1. Dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. 3.</hi> Not only for thoſe that neither deſerved, nor ſought after deliverance, but his ſufferings were for thoſe that <hi>were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; Rom. 5.10. If when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50399:129"/>ſon; Col. 1.21. And you that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath be reconciled:</hi> And the Enmity was ſo perfect that it corrupted the beſt habits of our minds, and turned thoſe into an abſtracted kind of enmity; the very wiſdom of the fleſh, earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh. <hi>Jam 3.15.</hi> So that there was not only in our [nature] an abſence of any good that might move God to do any thing for us, and an abſence of that life that might be ſollicitous for it ſelf; but there was a poſitive malignity in our nature againſt that God, that ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; againſt that Chriſt that ſhould ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; againſt that Grace and Spirit that ſhould apply: We were actuated with thoſe vile affections and luſts, that looked upon a Saviour with no leſs averſion and ſpite, than thoſe devils did, that cryed out of the poſſeſſed man, <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> And yet for theſe, and ſuch as theſe, our Saviour dyed; nay ſome of theſe (who) had actually their hands in his blood, <note place="margin">Heb 12.24.</note> found the efficacy of that very blood, which they ſhed, not crying for revenge againſt them, but for merey for them, and healing thoſe who had cruelly ſpilt it; the efficacy of that bleſſed prayer of his; <hi>Father, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50399:129"/>them, they know not what they do,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome few months after his death, did firſt wound their hearts with a ſenſe of their guilt, and then healed them with the infuſion of his blood. <hi>Act. 2.23, 37.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. From the conſideration of the former particulars, it will eaſily appear what was <hi>the Motive of this</hi> great work. We have ſeen in the creature [nothing] but ſin and enmity againſt God, and conſequently a juſt obligation to Everlaſting wrath and miſery: ſo there we can find nothing that might upon any account of merit or deſert draw out ſuch merey as this. We muſt ſeek for the motive in the Author of it; and in him there was <hi>no neceſſity</hi> at all to bind him to it: It was his own free will that at firſt gave man a being, and a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed being; and when he had ſinned againſt the law and condition of his Creation, there was a neceſſity of juſtice for his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal puniſhment, but no neceſſity at all for his Reſtitution. God made all things for his glory, not becauſe he ſtood in need of it; for he had in himſelf an infinite ſelf-ſufficiency and happineſs, that ſtood not in need of the glory of his creation, nor was capable of an acceſſion by it: And if it had, yet the great God could have enjoyed the glory of his juſtice, in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50399:130"/>the everlaſting puniſhment of unthankful man, and yet had glorious creatures e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the bleſſed Angels, to have been the everlaſting partakers and admirers of his goodneſs: And if there had been yet an abſolute neceſſity of viſible intellectual creatures, to be the participants of his goodneſs, and the active inſtruments of his glory; the ſame power that created man at firſt, could have created a new gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men, that might have ſupplied the defection of our firſt parents and their deſcendants. What then is the original of all this goodneſs to poor ſinful man? to purchaſe ſuch a worthleſs creature at ſuch an invaluable price as the blood of the Son of God? Nothing but Love; free unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved love; love that loved before it was ſought; that loved when it was rejected: <hi>Deut. 7.7. The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chooſe you, becauſe ye were more; but becauſe the Lord loved you;</hi> he loved you becauſe he loved you: As Almighty could not define himſelf by any thing but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>I am that I am,</hi> Exod. 3.14. ſo he can reſolve his love into no other motive than his love; he loved you becauſe he loved you: And here is the ſpring, the fountain of all this ſtrange and unheard of goodneſs of God in Chriſt; nothing but
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50399:130"/>the free love of God; <hi>Joh. 3.16. So God loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, &amp;c. 1 Joh. 4.10. Here is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be a propitiation for our ſins;</hi> and that very ſame individual love that was in the Father to ſend, was in the Son to come, and to dye for us. It was he that loved and waſhed us with his own blood; waſhed us becauſe he loved us. When we lay like <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> wretched infant, <hi>Ezek. 16.5, 6.</hi> polluted in our blood; when no eye pitied us, then this love of God paſſed by us, and ſaid unto us, live; yea ſaid unto us, when we were in our blood, live: And when that life was not acquirable for us, but by the death of the Eternal Son of God, then to purchaſe that life for us, he ſold his own; and to waſh us from the pollutions of our blood, freely ſpent and ſhed his own. This was <hi>The love of Chriſt, which paſſeth knowledge.</hi> Eph. 3.19.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Now let us conſider <hi>the End and Scope</hi> of this admirable Love of Chriſt: and as it looks upward towards God, ſo it looks downward towards [us;] as he was the Mediator between both, ſo the end of his Mediatorſhip had a reſpect to both: 1. <hi>In reference to God,</hi> and ſo the Ends of our Lord's ſuffering were principally theſe:</p>
            <pb n="240" facs="tcp:50399:131"/>
            <p n="1">1. To Reſtore unto Almighty God the active ſervice and glory of his creature. Almighty God did at the firſt create man in ſuch a conſtitution, that he might, not only paſſively and objectively, bring unto him the glory of his Power and Wiſdom in the framing of ſuch a creature, as the Heavens, the Stars and other creatures below an intellectual nature, do; but to be a beholder of himſelf and his works, to be an obſerver of his will, and to glorifie his Maker in the admiration of his Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and in the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Obſervance of his Law and will: and to his own glory had by an eternal bond annexed his creature's perfection and bleſſedneſs. Man rebelled, and thereby as he became unſerviceable to the end of his creation, ſo he loſt the bleſſedneſs of his condition: Chriſt came, and by his own blood purchaſed, as unto Man his bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo unto God the glory and ſervice of his creature: This was old <hi>Zachary's</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <hi>Luk. 2. 74, 75. That we being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs:</hi> Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſie unto himſelf a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple zealous of good works.</hi> And this was the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:50399:131"/>chief part of that account, that our Lord giveth unto his Father, in that bleſſed prayer that he made a little before his Paſſion, <hi>Joh. 17.4. I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, <q>Thou haſt ſent me into the world about a great and weighty buſineſs, the reſtitution of thy fallen creature; and, that therein as thy creature may partake of thy goodneſs, ſo thou mayſt reap the glory of thy creature's ſervice: And now behold according to that command of thine, I here return unto thee thy creature healed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, that [it] may be as well a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, as a proclaimer of thy goodneſs and glory, unto all Eternity.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To manifeſt unto Men and Angels the Glory and infinite Perfection and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of all his bleſſed Attributes: The glory of his Wiſdom in contriving, and of his Power in effecting ſuch a deliverance for the children of men, by a way that exceeded the diſquiſition of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; the glory of his Mercy, that could not have been poſſibly ſo conſpicuous to mankind, if man had never faln. In the Creation of Man he manifeſted the glory of his Goodneſs, that communicated a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ing to him. that ſo he might communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50399:132"/>his goodneſs to him: But in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Man he manifeſted his Mercy in forgiving and healing a rebellious and miſerable creature: the glory of his Juſtice, that would not pardon the Sin till he had a Satisfaction for the ſin; that would not ſpare the Son, when he choſe to be the ſurety for the ſinner.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. In reference to Man:</hi> and ſo the ends of our Lord's ſuffering were principally theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To abſolve and deliver him from guilt, the conſequence of ſin, and miſery the fruit of guilt; <hi>Eph. 1.7. In whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of ſins:</hi> and ſurely had the fruit of Chriſt's death reſted here, it had been a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of mercy; if we rightly weighed the heavineſs of the burden of guilt, the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the wrath of God, and the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of that miſery that doth and muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. If a man under the guilt and horror of ſome hideous Treaſon, under the ſevere and inexorable ſentence of the Law againſt [him,] under the imminent infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of moſt exquiſite and continuing tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould but hear of a Pardon and diſcharge from this, how welcome would it be, though the reſidue of his life were to be ſpent in exile? But our Lord's purchaſe reſts not here.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:50399:132"/>
            <p n="2">2. To Reconcile God unto his Creature: So that it doth not only remove the effects of the anger of God, which is puniſhment; which may be removed, and yet the anger continuing: nor doth it only remove the anger of God, and leaves a man in a kind of ſtate of indifferency, as it is between perſons that never were acquainted one with another: But it is a ſtate of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, <hi>Eph. 2.16. That he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the croſs, having ſlain the enmity thereby;</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them.</hi> And certainly this is a great addition unto [the] former, that God in Chriſt ſhould hot only paſs by our ſins, but ſhould no longer look upon us as ſtrangers, but as perſons reconciled unto him: And ſurely a ſoul ſenſible of the unhappy condition of being eſtranged from God, how highly would he prize a ſtate of reconciliation, though it were in the meaneſt and loweſt relation? <hi>Luk. 15.19. I am no more worthy to be called thy ſon, make me as one of thy hired ſervants:</hi> So that I may not be eſtranged from thee, reconcile me unto thy ſelf, though in the condition of thy meaneſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. But neither doth the happy fruit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur Lord's ſuffering reſt here.</p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:50399:133"/>
            <p n="3">3. To reſtore unto us that near and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed relation of being Sons of God: <hi>Gal. 4.5. That we might receive the adoption of ſons; 1 Joh. 3. 2. Behold now we are the ſons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be.</hi> This was that dear expreſſion of our Lord, after his reſurrection, <hi>Joh. 20.17. Go to my brethren, and tell them I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, to my God and to your God:</hi> he ſeems to intereſs them in this bleſſed relation in a kind of equality with himſelf; my Brethren, my Father and your Father; and the ſweet and comfortable conſequents of this are incomparable. Is he my Father? then I know he can pity me as a Father pitieth his Children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. he can pardon and ſpare me as a Father ſpareth his Son that ſerves him. <hi>Mal. 3.17.</hi> Is he my Father? then whither ſhould I go but to him for protection in all my dangers? for direction in all my difficulties? for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in all my doubts? for ſupply in all my wants? This I can with confidence expect from a poor earthly Father, according to the compaſs of his abilities: <hi>If ye then being evil know how to give good things unto your children, how much more ſhall your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</hi> Matth. 7.11. Mercy, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and Love, is a virtue in a man,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50399:133"/>in an earthly Father, a piece of that image of God which at firſt he imprinted in man; and yet paſſion and humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as it hath much weakened the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit thereof in us, ſo it may ſuſpend the exerciſe thereof to a near relation: But in Almighty God theſe virtues are in their perfection, and nothing at all in him that can remit it. Mercy and tenderneſs are attributes which he delights in; mercy pleaſeth him; it was that great attribute that he proclaimed his name by, <hi>Exod. 34.6.</hi> and ſo diffuſive is his mercy that it extends to all, he is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works, <hi>Pſal. 145.9.</hi> and not only to the juſt and good, but even to the unkind; cauſing his Sun to ſhine upon the evil and the good: and ſurely he that hath Mercy and Goodneſs for an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, cannot deny it unto a Child. <hi>Can a mother forget her ſucking child, &amp;c. Yea ſhe may forget; yet will I not forget thee, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Iſa. 49.15.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To reſtore us to a moſt ſure, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and bleſſed inheritance in heaven. Gal. 4.7. <hi>If a ſon, then an heir of God through Chriſt:</hi> and here is the complement of all; not only abſolved from the guilt of ſin, reconciled to God, put into the relation of a Child of God; but after all this, to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50399:134"/>be everlaſtingly and unchangeably ſtated in a bleſſed condition unto all Eternity: and all this from the condition of a moſt vile, ſinful, loſt creature, and by ſuch a price as the Blood of Chriſt. More need not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And by what hath been ſaid, it is eaſie to ſee what <hi>the Fruits and Effects</hi> of all this are. God will not be diſappointed in the end of ſo great a work, and therefore we cannot be diſappointed in the fruit of it; and thoſe are either ſuch as are enjoyed in this life, or principally appropriated to that which is to come. 1. Thoſe Benefits that naturally ariſe from Chriſt crucified, and are enjoyed <hi>in this life,</hi> are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Justification</hi> and Acceptation in the ſight of God: he looks upon us as thoſe that [have] ſatisfied his juſtice when his Son ſuffered; and as thoſe that performed his will, when his Son performed it: So that as our Lord imputed our fins to our Redeemer, ſo he imputes his righteouſneſs unto us; and as he was well pleaſed with him, ſo he was well pleaſed in him, with as many as are received into this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Peace with God.</hi> This is the natural conſequence of the former, <hi>Rom. 5.1. Being juſtifica by faith, we have peace with God
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50399:134"/>through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> the only cauſe of breach between God and his creature is ſin, and this being quite removed, the enmity between God and his creature is removed, and peace and love reſtored be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Free <hi>Acceſs unto God:</hi> for we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto peace with him, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently acceſs unto him; and indeed it is a part of that duty which he expects from us: our acceſs to him, is not only our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, as the acceſs of a Subject to his Prince, or a child to his father, but it is our duty, as a thing enjoyned unto us in teſtimony of our dependence and love unto him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Conſequently <hi>Peace with our ſelves and our own Conſcience;</hi> and that upon a double ground: 1. Becauſe our Conſcience is ſprinkled by the blood of Chriſt, which defaceth and oblitereth all thoſe black <hi>Items,</hi> that otherwiſe would be continually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon us. 2. Becauſe Conſcience ever ſideth with God, whoſe vicegerent ſhe is in the Soul, and hath the very ſame aſpect, for the moſt part, that heaven hath, and therefore if it be clear above, it is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily quiet within; and if God ſpeaks peace, the Conſcience, unleſs diſtempered, doth not ſpeak trouble.</p>
            <pb n="248" facs="tcp:50399:135"/>
            <p n="5">5. An Aſſurance of a continual <hi>ſupply of ſufficient Grace,</hi> to lead us through this vale of trouble, without a <hi>final apoſtacy</hi> or falling from him. Were our Salvation in our own hands, or managed by our own ſtrength, we ſhould utterly loſe it every moment; but the Power, and Truth, and Love of God is engaged in a Covenant of the higheſt ſolemnity that ever was, ſealed in the blood of the Son of God, for our preſervation: and it ſhall be as impoſſible for us to fall from that condition, as for the Almighty God to be diſappointed: No, his counſel and truth, the conſtant ſupply of the bleſſed Spirit of Chriſt, ſhall keep alive that ſeed of life, that he hath thrown into the ſoul. 1 <hi>Joh. 3.9. For his ſeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Sufficient Grace to preſerve us from, or ſupport us in, or deliver us out of <hi>temptations.</hi> We ſtand more in need of Grace, than we do of our bread; becauſe the conſequence of the want of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is of more danger than the latter, by ſo much as the Soul is more valuable than the Body: If our Father is pleaſed to furniſh us with our daily bread, <note place="margin">v. Rom. 8.32.</note> how ſhall he then deny us our daily and hourly ſupplies of his Grace?
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50399:135"/>Eſpecially ſince our intereſt therein is founded upon the covenant made in the blood of Chriſt. 2 <hi>Cor. 12.9. My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. A favourable <hi>Acceptation of our duties,</hi> ſince they are the performances of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and therefore not meaſured accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own worth, but according to the relation and affection from whence they proceed.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A Gentle and Merciful <hi>Pardoning of our Failings,</hi> even as a Father pitieth and pardoneth the infirmities of a Child; and though he doth not diſpenſe with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Offences, yet he either obſerves not or forgives their many Infirmities. And it is a Priviledge of high concernment to us, that as in our firſt converſion, the blood of Chriſt waſheth away a whole life of ſins at once, ſo after our converſion the ſame fountain ſtands open, whereunto we may and muſt reſort, to cleanſe our daily Failings. Chriſt received by faith in the heart, is a continual Sacrifice, which I may preſent unto the Father, for my ſins committed after my converſion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. A comfortable Reſtitution of a juſt <hi>Intereſt in the creatures.</hi> When man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the Allegiance he owed to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, the intereſt he had in the creature
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50399:136"/>did as it were eſcheat to the Lord: and though his goodneſs after permitted him the uſe of them, yet it was ſtill, as it were, upon account: And as the ſons of men have a great Account to give unto God for their ſins, ſo they have for his creatures; Chriſt hath reſtored unto us a better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in that, which Civil right hath made ours, than what we had before.</p>
            <p n="10">10. A <hi>Comfortable and Sanctified Uſe of all Conditions:</hi> in Proſperity, Moderation; in Adverſity, Contentedneſs; in all, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety. For as our Lord hath purchaſed for us Grace, to uſe all things aright; ſo he hath obtained for us an inheritance, that renders the beſt the world can give us, unworthy to be valued; and the worſt it can give us, unworthy to be feared, in reſpect of the bleſſedneſs which he hath ſetled upon us.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Conſequently <hi>Contempt of the World,</hi> becauſe higher matters are in my eye, ſuch as the beſt the world can yield, cannot equal; nor the worſt it can inflict, cannot take away. And all this upon,</p>
            <p n="12">12. A <hi>Lively Hope:</hi> a hope that maketh not aſhamed; even of that Glory which my Saviour came down from heaven to purchaſe by his blood; and the aſſurance whereof he hath ſealed with his blood:
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50399:136"/>
               <hi>Joh. 14.2, 3. I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go, and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, ye may be alſo:</hi> A hope of a bleſſed Reſurrection after death; a hope of that bleſſed appearance of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; a hope of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſentence in the preſence of Men and Angels, <hi>Come ye bleſſed;</hi> and an hope of an Everlaſting eſtate of Bleſſedneſs and Glory in the preſence of the great God, and the glorified Saints and Angels, unto all Eternity. And the efficacy of this hope dipt in the blood of Chriſt brings us Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: 1. <hi>Victory over Sin. Sin ſhall not have do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over you, for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace:</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>He that hath this hope purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Victory <hi>over the World,</hi> in <hi>the beſt</hi> it can afford us; its flatteries and favours: theſe are too ſmall and inconſiderable, when compared with this hope; they ſhine like a Candle in the Sun; and are ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to win over a Soul that is fixed upon this hope; and victory over <hi>the worſt</hi> the world can inflict: Our Lord hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the world in this reſpect <hi>for us: Be not afraid, I have overcome the world,</hi> Joh.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50399:137"/>16. 33. and conquered it <hi>in us; This is the victory that overcometh the world, even your Faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Victory <hi>over Death;</hi> which now, by means of this bleſſed hope is ſtript, as well of her terror as of her power: <hi>Thus thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.57.</p>
            <p>And now, though the nature of this argument hath carried my meditations to a great height, yet to avoid miſtakes ſome things I muſt ſubjoyn.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That when I thus aggravate the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our Lord under the imputed guilt of the ſins of mankind; yet we muſt not think, that his ſufferings were the ſame with the Damned, as not in duration, ſo neither in kind, nor in degree; for this could neither conſiſt with the purity of his Nature, nor innocence, nor dignity of his Perſon, nor the hypoſtatical union of both Natures in him: But he ſuffered as much as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with theſe conſiderations; and, as conſidering the dignity of his perſon, was equivalent to the ſin and demerits of all Mankind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That his righteouſneſs imputed to us, doth not exempt us from acquiring a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs inherent in us: this were to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint the end of his ſuffering, which
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50399:137"/>was to redeem us from our vain converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make us a peculiar people zealous of good works.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this purchaſe of Salvation by Chriſt for Believers, is not to render them idle, or ſecure, or preſumptuous; where there is ſuch a diſpoſition of Soul, it is an evident Indication, that it is not yet truly united unto Chriſt by true Faith and Love; his Grace is ſufficient to preſerve us, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready to do it, if we do not wilfully neglect or reject it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Some few Obſervations I ſhall deliver touching all theſe in the order propoſed.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Victory</hi> or Overcoming is a ſubjugation or bringing under an oppoſing party to the power and will of another: and this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory is <hi>of two kinds,</hi> complete and perfect, or incomplete and imperfect. 1. The notion of a <hi>complete</hi> victory is when either the oppoſing party is totally deſtroyed, or at leaſt when deſpoiled of any poſſibility of future reſiſtance: Thus the Son of God, the Captain of our Salvation overcame the World, <hi>Joh. 16.33. Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world;</hi> and thus when we are delivered from this body of death, we ſhall overcome the world: this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete victory will be the portion of the Church and Chriſtian triumphant. Again, 2. There is a victory but <hi>incomplete,</hi> ſuch as the victory of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was over the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> which though they were ſubdued, as to any poſſibility of a total reacquiring of a ſuperiority or equality of power, yet they were not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:50399:139"/>from a poſſibility of annoying, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieting and rebelling; they remained ſtill thorns to vex and diſturb, though not to ſubdue their conquerors; there was ſtill an over-ballance of power in the victors, though not wholly to extirpate them: And this is the condition of the Chriſtian mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in this world: he keeps the world in ſubjection, and every day gets ground upon it; but he cannot expect to obtain a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, complete and univerſal conqueſt of it, till he can truly ſay with our Bleſſed Lord, <hi>Joh. 14.30. The prince of this world hath nothing in me:</hi> Which cannot be till our change comes; for till then we carry about with us luſts and paſſions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; which, though with all vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy and ſeverity kept under and daily impaired in their power and malignity, will hold a correſpondence with the world and the prince thereof, and be ready to deceive and betray us, though never to regain their empire and ſovereignty; and the reaſon is ſignificantly given by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>1 Joh. 3.9. For his feed abideth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> Indeed he may and ſhall have ſin as long as he hath fleſh about him, <hi>1 Joh. 1.8. If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> But although we
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50399:140"/>have ſin ſtill abiding in us, and like the the byaſs in (a) Bowl warping us to the world, yet that vital ſeminal principle of the grace of God in Chriſt always keeps its ground, its life, and tendency toward heaven, and wears out, waſts, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſubdues the contrary tendency of ſin and corruption.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Perſon</hi> exerciſing this act of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and conqueſt, he that is <hi>Born of God.</hi> All men by nature may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to be born of God; the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Athenians,</hi> Act. 17.28. <hi>We are all his off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring:</hi> But in this place, this heavenly birth is <hi>a</hi> ſecond, a ſupervenient birth from God, and hence it is called Regeneration, the New birth, birth of the water and the Spirit, birth of the Spirit, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Chriſt in the ſoul; and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo new born ſtiled the New creature, the New man, a partaker of the divine nature, born not of the will of man nor of the will of the fleſh, but born of the will of God: And all theſe and the like expreſſions are figurative, and ſeem to carry in them a <hi>double analogy;</hi> firſt, to (the) firſt creation of mankind; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to the ordinary generation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſince their firſt creation: 1. As to the former analogy, we know by the Holy
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50399:140"/>Word that the firſt man was the root of all mankind, ſtamped with the ſignature of the image of Almighty God, principally conſiſting in Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and ſtood or fell as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon repreſentative of all mankind: This image of God was in a great meaſure loſt and defaced by the fall of man, and more every day ſpoiled by the actual ſins and acquired corruptions of his deſcendants: Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> had inſtamped upon him a new inſcription of the glorious God, came to be a common head, root, and parent of as many as are united unto him by faith, love, and imitation, and to inſtamp anew upon them that loſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed image of God; who thereby put on the New man, <hi>which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.24. and ſo becoming a New creature, <hi>2 Cor. 5.17. Galat. 5.6.</hi> renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him, <hi>Coloſſ. 1.10.</hi> they receive a new ſtamp and impreſſion from this great exemplar Chriſt Jeſus the true image of the inviſible God. 2. The ſecond analogy is to the ordinary generation of mankind; wherein as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but powerful, vital principle, which we call the Soul, forms and moulds the <hi>foetus</hi> according to the ſpecifical nature of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50399:141"/>man in all his lineaments and proportions, and never gives over its operation till it hath completed that bodily maſs into its full complement of parts, and afterwards gradually augments and perfects it in his organs and faculties: So by a vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple derived from God, through Chriſt, into the ſoul, the ſame is moulded, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned, formed, increaſed and perfected according to this new principle of life, which is uſually called <hi>Grace:</hi> Whereby it comes to paſs (that) as the ſoul is the vital and conforming principle of the body, ſo this grace is the very life, and vital and conforming principle of the ſoul: And hence this formative principle is called the life of the ſoul; the quickning ſpirit; and the conformation of the ſoul unto the will of God thereby is called the forming of Chriſt in them, the life of Chriſt, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of Chriſt in the heart by faith. And this new principle exerciſeth in the ſoul all the acts analogical to that natural vital principle in the body, giving to it as it were the image, lineaments, proportion, increaſe conformable to the image of God in Chriſt, as true Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Juſtice, Holineſs, Integrity, Love of God, Submiſſion to his will, Dependance upon him, and tranſlates them into all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50399:141"/>relations that Chriſt himſelf had, and inveſts them in his communicable priviledges: If he be a Son of God by nature, ſo are they by <note n="*" place="margin">By Adoption, and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature. 2 Pet. 1.4.</note> interpretation; is he an heir of heaven? ſo are they coheirs with him; is he accepted of God? ſo are they; is he an heir of glory? ſo are they. And as this conformation of the body by this vital principle is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a ſeminal principle (at leaſt as the inſtrument of its activity) derived from the parent; ſo the analogy holds here: we find <hi>a double ſeminal principle</hi> in this conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and both derived from Chriſt our head; <hi>viz.</hi> one External, another Internal. 1. The <hi>External</hi> ſeminal principle is the word and meſſage of the Divine doctrine, exemplary and holy life, ſingular love of Chriſt and of God through him to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, whereby we underſtand what he would have us do, the danger if we do otherwiſe, the bleſſed reward of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the great engagements of the love of God in ſending his Son to dye for us, the plain, familiar, eaſie way of attaining of happineſs; and becauſe we often learn better by example than by precept, the ſame word exhibits to us a lively picture of his holy converſation, his humility,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:50399:142"/>meekneſs, obedience, love, patience, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And this external means is in it ſelf a great moral means to conform our wills and lives thereunto; and therefore it is called the incorruptible ſeed of the word of God whereby we are born again, 1 <hi>Pet. 1.23.2.</hi> The <hi>Internal</hi> ſeed is that Spirit of grace ſent out from Chriſt, which doth derive a quickning lively power to the word and to the ſoul, whereby it makes it effectual to its end, and therefore called a Spirit of Life and Power, a Quickning Spirit: and this, not by transfuſing a new ſubſtance or ſubſtantial nature which before it had not, but by its lively yet ſecret ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations changing and moulding it ſuitable to the image of him whoſe Spirit it is, and adding energy and efficacy to that other ſeed of the word, as the Sun doth to the ſeminal principles of vegetables and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Touching <hi>the Thing</hi> upon which this victory is obtained and conqueſt made, it is <hi>the world:</hi> which comprehends in its latitude a double world; the world within us, and the world without us.</p>
            <p>The world <hi>within us,</hi> which may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſo called principally in this reſpect, that a great part of its relation and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency is toward the world, which is for
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:50399:142"/>the moſt part the object upon which it fixeth, the ſubject after which it reacheth, and the buſineſs upon which it faſteneth and exerciſeth: and hence it is that the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>John</hi> divides the world without us with relation to the world within us, viz. <hi>The luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.16. The world that is within us taketh in the <hi>two great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties or powers,</hi> viz. 1. the Paſſions of the ſoul, and 2. the Senſual Appetite; both theſe are in their own nature good, placed in us by the wiſe God of Nature for moſt excellent ends and uſes. Our buſineſs is therefore to keep in order and ſubjection, not to extirpate and root them out; for they are radicated in our nature by the God of Nature. But of this more particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. Our Paſſions:</hi> ſuch as are Love, Hatred, Anger, Hope, Fear, Joy, Sorrow; theſe and the like paſſions of the humane Soul are not ſimply in themſelves evil; nay, being rightly placed and duly ordered and regulated they become ſerviceable to excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ends and uſes; and therefore ſimply in themſelves they are not the ſubject of a Chriſtian's victory: But then they become ſuch when they become the world in the Text, and that is principally in theſe Caſes; 1. When they are <hi>miſplaced;</hi> as when we
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50399:143"/>love the things we ſhould hate, hope for the things we ſhould fear, rejoyce in that we ſhould grieve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or <hi>è converſo.</hi> 2. When they are <hi>immoderate</hi> or <hi>exceſſive</hi> about their proper objects: which comes to paſs, when in thoſe things about which we may exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our paſſions lawfully, we exceed that meaſure or proportion that is due to them: For inſtance, I may lawfully love a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of worldly ſubſiſtence, but I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this, that I love it too much and beyond the worth that is truly in it: I may lawfully be angry with him that injures me, but I exceed in the meaſure, or degree, or time, or duration, and become impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. 3. When my affections or paſſions are <hi>not acted to that height they ought to be:</hi> All finite objects of our paſſions require a proportionate degree of our paſſions; but where the object is infinite, my affections may erre in <hi>being too remiſs,</hi> but not in the exceſs: I cannot love God too much, for I am to love him with all my might; but I may love him too little, and then my affection errs: I cannot hate ſin too much, becauſe I cannot love God too much; but I may hate it too little. 4. When my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections or paſſions are <hi>acted unſeaſonably,</hi> either in reſpect of the time or in reſpect of the competition between objects of ſeveral
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:50399:143"/>values: I may, nay I muſt love my Father; but if I love my Father more than my Saviour, my Saviour hath pronounced me unworthy of him. 5. When my paſſions <hi>degenerate into vices and corruptions,</hi> and ſo become not ſo much powers or faculties as diſeaſes and ſickneſſes of the ſoul: as when anger degenerates into malice, revenge; when ſelf-love degenerate into envy; when deſire of, or delight in, the profits or honours of the world degenerates into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs or ambition; and the like. 6. When my paſſions are <hi>not under the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, guidance or conduct of my ſuperior faculties,</hi> my reaſon and judgment; but either go before they are ſent, or go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what they are ſent, or return not and ſubſide when recalled: and then they breed infinite perturbation in the ſoul, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the order of nature, and become furies and tempeſts, and impriſon and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivate the mind and underſtanding, and become a worſe part of the world than that which is without us. Under theſe conditions our paſſions and affections are part of that world which is the object of a Chriſtian's warfare and victory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other part of this world within us are the motions and tendencies of our <hi>Senſual Appetite.</hi> This ſenſual appetite is
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50399:144"/>in it ſelf good, placed in us by the God of Nature for excellent ends; <hi>viz.</hi> for the preſervation of the individual nature, as eating and drinking, and thoſe invitations of ſenſe ſubſervient thereunto; or for the preſervation of the ſpecies, as the deſires of ſexes. But they then become a ſinful part of this inferior world, 1. when they become inordinate, 2. or exceſſive, 3. or unſeaſonable; or generally, 4. when they are not ſubordinate in their actings to the government of reaſon enlightened by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or religious light. A Chriſtian hath no ſuch enemies without him, as unruly and undiſciplined luſts and paſſions within him; and it is a vain thing to think of overcoming the world without us, until this world within us be brought into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; for without the corruptions and luſts within, the world, and the evil men of the world, and the evil one of the world, could not hurt us.</p>
            <l>—<hi>Non vulnus adactis</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Debetur gladiis, percuſſum eſt pectore ferrum.</hi>
            </l>
            <p>The wedge of gold was an innocent thing, but <hi>Achan's</hi> covetous heart within gave it ſtrength to do harm. We come into the world as into a great ſhop full of all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of wares accommodate to our ſenſes,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50399:144"/>luſts and affections; and were it not for theſe; thoſe wares would lye long enough upon the hands of the prince of this world, before they could get within us or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt us.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. The world without us</hi> is <hi>of three kinds;</hi> 1. The <hi>Natural</hi> world, which is the work of Almighty God, moſt certainly in it ſelf good; and is not evil but accidentally, by man's abuſe of himſelf or it. It doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a general ſupply of objects anſwerable to the deſires of our vegetable and ſenſible nature, and the exigences and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it; is a great ſhop full of all ſorts of wares anſwerable .... there is wealth and places and delights for the ſenſes, and it becomes an enemy to us by reaſon only of the diſorder and irregularity of thoſe luſts and paſſions that are within us, and by reaſon of the over-value that we are apt to put upon them; they are indeed temptations, but they are only paſſive, as the wedge of gold did paſſively tempt <hi>Achan,</hi> but it was his own luſt and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs that did him the harm: the rock doth not ſtrike the ſhip, but the ſhip ſtrikes the rock and breaks it ſelf. This world, as it is not evil in it ſelf, ſo moſt certainly it is full of goodneſs and benevolence to us: it ſupplies our wants, is accommodate
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50399:145"/>to the exigences and conveniences of our nature; furniſheth (us) with various ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and inſtances of the divine goodneſs, liberality, bounty; of his power and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and glory; of his wiſdom, providence and government; which are ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to teach us to know, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and magnifie him; to walk thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, dutifully, and obediently unto him; to teach us reſignation, contentedneſs, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and dependence upon him. A good heart will be made better by it; and if there be evil in it, it is ſuch as our own corrupt natures occaſions or brings upon it, or upon our ſelves by it: and it is a great part of our Chriſtian warfare and diſcipline to teach us to uſe it as it ought to be uſed, and to ſubdue thoſe luſts and corruptions that abuſe it, and our ſelves by it. Again ſecondly, there is another world without us, <hi>the malignant and evil world,</hi> the world <hi>of evil Angels and of evil Men, Mundus in maligno poſitus;</hi> and the great miſchiefs of this world are of two kinds; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Incentives and temptations from it, that are apt to bring the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into the evil of ſin and offence againft God; ſuch as are evil examples, evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, evil counſels, evil perſwaſions and ſollicitations. 2. The troubles, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:50399:145"/>and vexations, and perſecutions, and oppreſſions, and calumnies, and reproaches, and diſgraces, that are inflicted by them: And the evil that ariſeth from theſe are of two kinds; <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as they immediately cauſe, which is great uneaſineſs, and griefs, and ſorrow; and again, ſuch as conſequentially ariſe from theſe, namely, the evil of ſin, as impatience, diſcontent, unquietneſs of mind, murmurings againſt the Divine Providence, doubtings of, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting go our confidence in God, diſturſt, unbelief, and putting forth our hands to iniquity to deliver our ſelves from theſe inconveniences, either by unlawful or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden means, by ſinful compliances with the ſinful world, by falling in with them to deliver our ſelves from their oppreſſions, perſecutions or wrongs, by raiſing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, engaging in parties, and infinite more unhappy conſequences. And thirdly, there is a third kind of world which is in a great meaſure without us, namely, the accidental, or more truly <hi>the providential world</hi> in relation to man and his condition in this world, and is commonly <hi>of two kinds, viz.</hi> proſperous or adverſe. Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or worldly <hi>Proſperity</hi> conſiſts in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate condition of man in this world; as, health of body; comfort of friends and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50399:146"/>relations; affluence, or at leaſt competency of wealth, power, honour, applauſe, good report and the like: The dangers that ſteal upon mankind in this condition are pride, haughtineſs of mind, arrogance, vain-glory, inſolence, oppreſſion, ſecurity, contempt of others, love of the world, fear of death and deſires of diverſion from the thoughts of it, luxury, intemperance, ambition, covetouſneſs, neglect and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs and a low eſteem of God, the life to come, and our duty. 2. <hi>Adverſity;</hi> as, ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, poverty, loſs of friends and eſtate, publick or private diſturbances or calamities, and the like: And though oftentimes theſe are occaſioned by the evil or malignant world, yet many times they ſeem to come accidentally, and are apt to breed impatience, diſcontent, unquietneſs of mind, diſtruſt of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, murmuring, envy at the external felicity of others, and that common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure which we ordinarily find in our ſelves and others upon like occaſions.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The fourth conſiderable is, what is this <hi>Faith</hi> which thus overcometh the world; which is nothing elſe but a deep, real, full, ſound perſwaſion of and aſſent unto thoſe great truths revealed in the Scriptures of God, upon the account that
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50399:146"/>they are truly the word and will of the Eternal God, who is truth it ſelf, and can neither deceive nor be deceived: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe <hi>two matters</hi> are <hi>conſiderable;</hi> 1. What are thoſe divine truths which being really and ſoundly believed doth enable the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over the world, or the ſpecial objects of that victorious faith: 2. What is that act of faith or belief of theſe excellent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which thus overcometh the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the former of theſe, although the whole body of divine truths is <hi>the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate object</hi> of faith, yet there ſeem to be certain ſpecial heads or parts of divine truths that have the greateſt influence into this victory over the world. I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome of them: namely, 1. That there is one moſt Powerfyl, Wiſe, Gracious, Bountiful, Juſt and All-ſeeing God, the Author of all being, that is preſent in all places, knows our thoughts, our wants, our ſins, our deſires, and is ready to ſupply us with all things that are good and fit for us beyond all we can ask or think; hath incomprehenſible Wiſdom, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Power to effect what he pleaſeth; that leaves not any of his works, eſpecially mankind, without his ſpecial care and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendence over them; without whoſe will or deſigned permiſſion nothing befalls
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50399:147"/>us. 2. That this moſt Wiſe and Juſt and Powerful God hath appointed a law or rule, according to which his will is that the children of men ſhould conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and according to the upright en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the children of men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thereunto, he will moſt certainly give rewards; and according to the wilful tranſgreſſions thereof he will inflict puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and that he is a moſt ſtrict and infallible obſerver of all the wayes of the children of men, whether of obedience or diſobedience thereunto. 3. That this law and will of his he hath communicated and revealed unto the children of men in his Holy Word; eſpecially by the miſſion of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, who brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world a full and complete collection of thoſe holy Laws of God, whereunto he would have us conform. 4. That he hath given unto mankind, in and through Chriſt Jeſus, a full manifeſtation of a future life after this of rewards and puniſhments; and according to that law of his thus mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by his Son, he will, by the ſame Jeſus Chriſt, diſpenſe and execute the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of rewards and puniſhments, and judge every man according to his works. 5. And that the reward of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in that other life to come, ſhall
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:50399:147"/>be an eternal, bleſſed, happy eſtate of ſoul and body in the glorious Heavens, and in the preſence and fruition of the ever Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Eternal God. 6. And that the puniſhment of the rebellious and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto this will and law of God thus manifeſted by his Son, ſhall be an eternal ſeparation of ſoul and body from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and the concluſion of them under chains of darkneſs and everlaſting torments in hell fire. 7. And that the Son of God hath given us the greateſt aſſurance imaginable of the truth of this will of God, of this happineſs and miſery, by taking upon (him) our nature, by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, by his death and reſurrection and aſcention into glory, and by his miſſion of the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation into his Apoſtles and Diſciples, both to inſtruct the world in his truſt, and to evidence the truth of their miſſion from him. 8. That Almighty God, though full of juſtice and ſeverity againſt obſtinate and rebellious, yet, is full of tenderneſs, love and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards all thoſe that ſincerely deſire to obey his will and to accept of terms of peace and reconciliation with him, and is ready upon repentance and amendment to pardon whatſoever is amiſs, and hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly promiſed it: And that he hath
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:50399:148"/>the care and love and tenderneſs of a father towards us; that in our ſincere endeavour of obedience to him, we ſhall be ſure of his love, favour, and protection; that in all our afflictions and troubles he ſtands by us, and will not leave us; that he will moſt certainly make good every promiſe that by Chriſt he hath ſent unto us, for the life that is preſent and that which is to come; that the Law he hath ſent us by Chriſt to ſubmit unto is an eaſie and good Law, ſuch as will perfect our nature and fit it to be partaker of his glory; and that all his thoughts towards us in our faithful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obey him, are thoughts of love, favour, peace, bounty and goodneſs. And of this he hath given the greateſt aſſurance that is poſſible for mankind to expect or deſire, even the ſending of his Eternal Son into the world to take upon him our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to acquaint us with his Father's will and love, to live a life of want and miſery, and to dye a death full of ſhame and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, to riſe again to diſpatch Meſſengers into all the world to publiſh the good will of God to mankind, to aſcend up into glory, and there to make interceſſion for us poor worms at the right hand of God: giving us alſo hereby aſſurance of our reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and of his coming again to judge
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50399:148"/>the world, and to receive his obedient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants into eternal glory. Theſe be ſome of thoſe principal Objects of that Faith that overcometh the World, being ſoundly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, believed and digeſted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As touching <hi>the act</hi> it ſelf; it is no other than a ſound, real and firm belief of thoſe Sacred Truths: And therefore it ſeems that they that perplex the notion of <hi>Faith</hi> with other intricate and abſtruſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions or deſcriptions, either render it very difficult and ſcarce intelligible, or elſe take into the definition or deſcription thoſe things that are but the conſequents and effects of it. He that hath this firm perſwaſion will moſt certainly repent of (his) ſins paſt, will moſt certainly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour obedience to the will of God, which is thus believed by him to be holy, juſt and good, and upon the obedience or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience whereof depends his eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or miſery, will moſt certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the promiſes of God for this life and that to come; for thoſe are as natural effects of ſuch a firm perſwaſion, as it is for the belief of a danger to put a man upon means to avoid it, or for the belief of a benefit to put a man upon means to attain it. Some things are of ſuch a nature that the belief or knowledge of them goes no
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50399:149"/>further, but it reſts in it ſelf, as the belief or knowledge of bare ſpeculative truths: But ſome things are of ſuch a nature as being once truly and firmly believed or known, carry a man out to action: and ſuch are eſpecially the knowledge or belief of ſuch things as are the objects of our fears or of our hopes; the belief of ſuch objects do naturally and with a kind of moral ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity carry a man out to action; to the avoiding of ſuch fears, and the attaining of ſuch hopes: And therefore faith and belief in reference thereunto comes often in the Scripture under the names of hope and fear, as being the proper effects of it. Inſtances we have of both, 2 <hi>Cor. 5.10, 11. For we muſt all appear before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we perſwade men.</hi> 1 Joh.3.2, 3. <hi>But we know that when he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is; and every man that bath this hope in him purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we need not be ſo ſollicitous touching the nature of faith, what kind of faith it is that muſt ſave us: certainly if it be a true and real aſſent of the mind to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:50399:149"/>theſe great truths of God, it muſt be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, according to the nature of the things believed which are in order to working; and therefore if it have not that effect, it is not faith nor aſſent; if it have it but weakly and imperfectly, it is evident that the aſſent is weak and fluctuating; if it have that effect at ſome times but not at others, it is evident that the aſſent is ſuſpended, or intermitted, or not actually exerciſed at theſe intermiſſions: If a man were really and fully perſwaded that if he take ſuch a journey to morrow he ſhould certainly break his leg, he would as certainly not go: or if he were under a certain perſwaſion, that if he took ſuch a drink, he ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly recover his loſt health, it were as certain he would drink it: and if a man were actually and fully perſwaded that, if he uſed ſuch a means, he ſhould attain ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs, or, if he ſhould commit ſuch a ſin, he ſhould certainly loſe it, it were ſcarce morally poſſible, that a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man in his wits would omit the one or commit the other.</p>
            <p>And to ſay, this is but an <hi>hiſtorical faith,</hi> and that the devils have as much, they believe and tremble, and they do as fully aſſent to divine truths as any can do, yet it avails them not, concludes nothing: the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50399:150"/>reaſon is evident, becauſe the ſalvation to be attained, the faith which is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attain it, concerns them not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they in a ſtate to be advantaged by it; but it is otherwiſe with men. If I ſhould acquaint a ſtranger that if my Son doth ſuch a thing, I will give my Son five pound, though the ſtranger believes it as really true as any thing in the world, it puts not him upon the action, becauſe as he is not concerned in the reward, ſo he is not concerned in the means: but according to the belief that my Son hath, it will or will not put him upon the action: if he believe me not, he will not do it at all; if he believe it faintly and doubtingly, he will perform the action accordingly; but if he believe it truly and fully, and ſet any value upon the reward, he will perform it cheerfully; for he is concerned in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and in the means to attain it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> therefore is a firm aſſent to the ſacred truths, whether the truths relate to things paſt, as that God made the world, that Chriſt the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is come in the fleſh, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> or to things preſent, as that Almighty God beholds all I do, and knows all I think, or that he is a reconciled Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto me in Chriſt Jeſus; or things to come which principally excite thoſe two
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50399:150"/>great movers of the Soul, Hope and Fear, the future life of rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="5">V. I come to the fifth thing, <hi>viz. How Faith overcometh</hi> the World, which takes in theſe two Conſiderations; 1. How that is, in what degree: 2. How that is, by what method or means. Touching the former of theſe, touching <hi>the degree</hi> of the victory that faith gives, it is a victory, but not a victory to utter extermination: The Captain of our Salvation indeed overcame the world, totally, perfectly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. our victory is not complete nor perfect on this ſide death, but it is ſuch a victory as leaves ſtill an adverſary to conteſt with us, though not to ſubdue and conquer us. It is a victory, but yet not without a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued warfare.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Touching <hi>the Method</hi> whereby our faith overcometh the world, I ſhall ſay ſomething in general, ſomething more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with relation to the world under the former acceptations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In general</hi> therefore, the great method whereby faith overcometh the world, is by rectifying our judgments, and removing thoſe miſtakes that are in us concerning the world and our own condition. 1. Some things there are in the world, which we
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:50399:151"/>ſet an eſteem and value and love upon, which deſerve rather our hatred and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation: As, our ſins, the irregula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es of our luſts and paſſions, and thoſe dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate plants that ariſe from them; as pride, ambition, revenge, intemperance, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> theſe we account our right hands and our right eyes, in our ſtate of natural dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Faith rectifies this miſtake of our judgment, by ſhewing us the Law and will of God revealed by Chriſt, whereby we find that theſe are our diſeaſes, diſtempers and ſickneſſes repugnant to the will, image and command of God; that they are our loſs and our danger and our ruine, and therefore not to be entertained but morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and crucified. 2. Some things there are in the world, that we may allow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of our affections unto, but we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value them: We reckon wealth, and honours, and powers the greateſt happineſs imaginable, and therefore intenſly deſire them; ſickneſſes, and afflictions, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and loſſes the greateſt miſery imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and therefore we fear them exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, we are intollerably diſcontented under them. Faith rectifies our miſtake herein, gives us a juſt value of theſe things, ſhews us the Law of God, checking and forbidding immoderate affections or paſſions
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50399:151"/>to be exerciſed about them, aſſures us that we are, as well under the view and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as under the care and regiment of the great Lord of heaven and earth, and therefore expects our great moderation in relation to externals. 3. And principally, for the moſt part the children of men eſteem this life the uttermoſt term or limit of their happineſs or miſery, and therefore make it their whole buſineſs, by all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to make their lives here as ſplendid and glorious, as delightful and pleaſurable, as is poſſible; and uſe all means, whether honeſt or diſhoneſt, fit or unfit, to ſecure themſelves in the good they have, and to avoid any thing that is grievous or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom: and if they cannot compaſs it they ſink, and deſpond, and murmur, and dye under it, as the only Hell imaginable; or if they have any thoughts of a future eſtate after death, yet they are but languid, faint, and ſearce believed in any tollerable degree, and ſuſpected rather as the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of Politicians, or fables of Poets, than having any real truth in them. Faith rectifies this miſtake, and aſſures us there is a judgment to come, a ſtate of rewards and puniſhments of a far higher nature than this world can afford, or indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; that the happineſs of that life
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50399:152"/>out-bids all the greateſt and moſt glorious entertainments that this world can afford, and will infinitely exceed the greateſt loſſes or croſſes that this world can yield: And on the other ſide, the puniſhments of that life will infinitely over-ballance all the pleaſures and contentments that this life here can yield, and the memory of them will but enhance the rate and degree of thoſe torments: and that accordingly as men ſpend their lives in this ſhort tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory life, either in obedience or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto the divine will, accordingly the retribution of everlaſting rewards and puniſhments will be there given. This view of the future ſtate, preſented by faith to the Soul, will have theſe <hi>two great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi> in order to the ſubduing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of the world without us, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it poor, inconſiderable, contemptible in compariſon of thoſe everlaſting joys and happineſs of the next life; and the world within us, by chaining up our exorbitant luſts and paſſions under the fear of the judgment to come, and by ordering, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing and regulating them in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the great reward annexed to our dutiful obedience unto God in this life.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall come to <hi>particulars,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:50399:152"/>that tract that is before given, in the diſtribution of the world, as well within, as without us; and conſider the particular method of faith in the ſubduing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering them. 1. Therefore in reference to the world <hi>within us,</hi> namely, 1. our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, 2. our Luſts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to our <hi>Paſſions:</hi> 1. Faith directs their due placing upon their proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by diſcovering what are the true and proper objects of them, out of that large and comprehenſive law of God which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents <hi>them</hi> as ſuch to the ſoul, and to be obſerved under the pain of the diſpleaſure of the glorious and Almighty God. 2. Upon the ſame account it teacheth our paſſions and affections moderation in their exerciſe, even about their proper objects, and due ſubordination to that ſupreme love a man owes to the ſupreme good, God Almighty. 3. Upon the ſame account it teacheth us, under our obligation of duty to God, to cut off, crucifie and mortifie the diſeaſes and corruptions of paſſions, as malice, envy, revenge, pride, vain-glory, oſtentation</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reference to our <hi>Deſires:</hi> 1. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it teacheth us great moderation, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, ſobriety; it tells us theſe very natural propenſions are apt to grow unruly and conſequently hurtful, and therefore
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:50399:153"/>that we are to keep them in ſubjection and under diſcipline both to Religion and to Reaſon: And this it doth, by aſſuring us that ſuch is the will and law of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; by aſſuring us that the ſame Almighty God is the conſtant obſerver of all our moſt intimate deportments; it aſſures us that the Son of God died to redeem us from the captivity of our luſts; that if we be kept ſtill in ſervitude under them we make an ungrateful return to his love, and what in us lyes, diſappoint him of the end of his ſufferings: It ſhews us the great falſeneſs, deceit and treachery of theſe luſts, that they are ready upon every occaſion to rebell againſt God and his Law placed in our ſouls; that they are upon every occaſion ready to betray us to our worſt enemy, and if they once get looſe from diſcipline and ſubjection, they are hard to be reclaimed; and therefore muſt be kept under a careful, vigilant and auſtere diſcipline; that if we do ſo order them, we are ſafe in a great meaſure from the temptations of the world and the devil, who could not hurt us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the compliance, inordinateneſs, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and correſpondence of theſe cloſe enemies within us. 2. As touching thoſe degenerate and corrupt luſts, as, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, Malice, Envy; faith doth firſt of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50399:153"/>all in general ſhew us, that they are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the great Lord and Law-giver of heaven and earth, and that under ſevere penalties; again ſecondly, it ſhews us that they are the great depravers and embaſers of our nature, the diſturbers of the peace, ſerenity, and tranquility of our minds; again thirdly, if ſhews us, that they are vain, impertinent, and unneceſſary pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations, ſuch as can never do us any real good, but feed our vain imaginations with deceits inſtead of realities. But particular inſtances in relation to theſe ſeveral luſts will render theſe truths more evident. 1. Therefore for Covetouſneſs or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate deſire of wealth, ambition, the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate deſires of honour or power, we ſhall ſee how faith or true aſſent to the truths of God revealed in his Word doth correct and crucifie this luſt, and that principally by theſe enſuing Conſiderations: 1. Faith diſcovers to us that the great Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, to whom we owe a moſt univerſal and indiſpenſible obedience, hath forbidden this luſt, hath told us we muſt not be over-ſollicitous for the things of this life, and we have no reaſon to ſuſpect his wiſdom in ſuch prohibitions, for he is infinitely wiſe, and knows beſt what is fitteſt for us to do or not to do; neither
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50399:154"/>have we cauſe to ſuſpsect his love to us, or to think he envies us in his commands, either to enjoyn what might be hurtful for us, or to forbid what might be beneficial to us; for it was his free and immenſe love that gave us at firſt our being, and therefore certainly can never envy us any thing that might be good or convenient for that being, which he at firſt freely gave and ſtill freely continues to us. 2. Faith ſhews us the vanity and lowneſs of ſuch deſires, re-minds us that when death comes all theſe objects will be utterly inſignificant; that they are tranſient, incertain objects, ſuch as are not only fitted barely for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of this life, but ſuch as oftentimes take wings and fly away from us before we leave them, ſuch as in their very enjoyment ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie not, but inſtead of ſatisfaction are oftentimes vexations and thorns to afflict us. 3. Faith preſents us with better things, more ſafe to be deſired, more eaſily to be attained, more ſecurely to be kept, namely, our peace with God, and the firm and ſound aſſurance of everlaſting happineſs. 4. Faith preſents us with an aſſurance of the divine particular Providence, which gives and takes away, and grants or denies the things upon which our deſires are thus fixed, and therefore renders our immoderate cares and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50399:154"/>thoughtfulneſs for the buſineſſes of this life either needleſs or vain: Your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all theſe things, commands us to caſt our care upon him, for he careth for us that knows what is fitteſt for us; if abundance, he is able to ſupply us without torturing our ſelves with care or ſollicitouſneſs; if the contrary, either we covet in vain and our endeavours ſhall be diſappointed, or at leaſt they ſhall be given, but a curſe and vexation with them, given us in anger, given us to our hurt: and the ſame may be ſaid in all points in relation to ambition and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of honours or power. 2. Again, in relation to malice or envy againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of others, faith ſhews us how vain and fooliſh a thing it is, and the rather becauſe the wiſe and great God is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of all things, hath the abſolute and unlimited propriety in them, diſpoſeth them according to his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. What reaſon hath any man to envy that diſpoſal which the God of heaven makes. Again, 3. For revenge, the great Lord of the world hath reſerved that as (a) branch of his own ſupreme Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; vengeance is mine, ſaith the Lord: what have you or I to do to invade his prerogative? it is his own right, and he
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50399:155"/>beſt knows when, and where, and in what degree to exerciſe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I come to the conſideration of the world <hi>without us,</hi> as that which poſſibly is here principally intended, and the victory of the Chriſtian by his faith over it, and firſt in relation to <hi>the Natural World.</hi> This world, as hath been obſerved, is in it ſelf very good, and the evil that ariſeth from it is only occaſional. Which is thus, it is a goodly Palace fitted with all grateful objects to our ſenſes, full of variety and pleaſantneſs, and the ſoul faſtening upon them is ready with <hi>Peter</hi> in the Mount to conclude that it is good to be here, and therefore grows careleſs of the thoughts of another ſtate after death, or to think of the paſſage to it, or making proviſion for it; but to ſet up its hopes and happineſs and reſt in it, and in theſe delights and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations that it yields our ſenſes. Faith overcometh this part of the world, by aſſuring the ſoul, that this lower world is only the place of our probation, not of of our happineſs; our Inn, not our home: It preſents to the mind a ſtate of happineſs, to be attained after death, infinitely ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all the contents and conveniences that this world can yield; and that one great means to attain it, is by ſetting our hearts
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50399:155"/>upon it, and not upon the world, but uſing this preſent world not as the end of our hopes, but as our paſſage to it; and to carry a watchful hand over our deſires and delights towards it, or in it; that it ſteal not away our heart from out everlaſting treaſure; to carry a ſober and temperate mind towards it, and uſe of it as in the ſight of that God, that lends it us, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our thankfulneſs and try our obedience, not to rob him of the love, and ſervice, and duty we owe unto him. In ſhort, the methods whereby faith overcometh this part of the world are theſe: 1. By giving us a true eſtimate of it, to prevent us from overvaluing it: 2. By frequent re-minding of us, that it is only fitted to the meridian of this life, which is ſhort and tranſitory and paſſeth away: 3. By preſenting unto us a ſtate of future happineſs, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſurpaſſeth it: 4. By diſcovering our duty in our walk through it, namely of great moderation and vigilancy: 5. By preſenting unto us the example of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation, his deportment in it, and towards it: 6. By aſſuring us that we are but Stewards unto the great Lord of the Family of Heaven and Earth for ſo much as we have of it, and that to him we muſt give an account of our ſteward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50399:156"/>7. By aſſuring us that our great Lord and Maſter is a conſtant obſerver of all our deportment in it: 8. And that he will moſt certainly give a reward proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the management of our truſt and ſtewardſhip; <hi>viz.</hi> if done ſincerely, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and obediently to our great Lord and Maſter, a reward of everlaſting happineſs and glory; but if done falſly, ſinfully, and diſobediently, then a reward of everlaſting loſs and miſery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond kind of world, <hi>the Malignant World</hi> of evil men and evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and therein firſt in relation to the <hi>evil Counſels</hi> and <hi>evil Examples</hi> that ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit or tempt us to breach of our duty to God, the methods whereby faith overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this part of the malignant world, are theſe: 1. It preſents unto us our duty that we owe to God, and which we are bound indiſpenſibly to obſerve under the great penalty of loſs of our happineſs. 2. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with the great advantage that we have in obeying God, above whatſoever advantage we can have in obeying or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſinful examples, counſels, or commands of this world; and the great exceſs of our diſadvantage in obeying or following the evil examples or counſels of the world; and this makes him at a point
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50399:156"/>with theſe follicitations, peremptory to conclude it is better to obey God than man; and with <hi>Joſeph, How can I commit this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> 3. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents Almighty God ſtrictly obſerving our carriage in relation to theſe temptations. 4. It preſents us with the diſpleaſure and indignation of the ſame God, in caſe we deſert him, and ſollow the ſinful examples, or counſels of men; and with the great favour, love, approbation, and reward of Almighty God, if we keep our fidelity and duty to him. 5. It preſents us with the noble example of our Bleſſed Saviour. 6. It preſents us with the tranſcendent love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, who to redeem and reſcue us from the miſery of our natural condition, and from the dominion of ſin, and to make us a peculiar people zealous of good works, choſe to become a curſe and dye for us, the greateſt obligation of love and gratitude and duty imaginable: And then it leaves the Soul <hi>impartially to judge</hi> which is the better of the two, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this malignant World can propound any thing that can be an equivalent motive to follow their commands or examples, or that can equal the love of our Saviour, the reward of eternal life, and the favour of the ever-glorious God; and which muſt
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50399:157"/>be denied and loſt by a ſinful compliance with evil counſels, commands, or examples of an evil world. It is true, the world can perchance reward my compliance herein with honour, and applauſe, and favour, and riches, or they can puniſh my neglects with reproach, and ſcorn, and loſs, and poverty, and it may be with death: but what proportion do theſe bear to the favour and love of God, and an eternal recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of glory and endleſs happineſs? The terms therefore of my obedience to the loving and gracious God (to whom I owe my utmoſt duty and obedience, though there were no reward attending it) do infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely out-bid, and out-weight whatſoever a ſinful world can either give or inflict. And ſecondly, as to the other part or Scene of this malignant world, <hi>Perſecutions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, Scorns, yea Death it ſelf,</hi> Faith pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the ſoul not only with the foregoing conſiderations and that glorious promiſe, <hi>Be faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a crown of life,</hi> but ſome other conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that are peculiarly proper to this condition: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That it is that ſtate, that our bleſſed Saviour hath not only foretold, but hath annexed a ſpecial promiſe of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs unto, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake, (for) theirs is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50399:157"/>the kingdom of heaven.</hi> 2. That there have gone before us a noble Cloud of Examples in all Ages, yea the Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was thus made perfect by ſuffering. 3. That though it is troubleſom, it is but ſhort, and ends with death, which will be the paſſage into a ſtate of incorruptible happineſs: And this was that which made the Three Children at a point with the greateſt Monarch in the world ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the ſevereſt death upon them; <hi>Our God whom we ſerve is able to deliver us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but if not, know O king that we will not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thy graven image which thou haſt ſet up.</hi> And therefore our Bleſſed Lord redoubles the injunction of our fear toward him that can deſtroy both body and ſoul in hell, but forbids any fear of ſuch perſecutors, who can only deſtroy the body and then can do no more. And certainly that man that hath full aſſurance of favour and eſteem with the great God of heaven and earth, of an incorruptible weight and crown of glory the next moment after death, muſt needs have a low eſteem of the reproaches and ſcorns and perſecutions of men for righteoufneſs ſake; and ſo much the rather becauſe that very favour with God, and that very crown of happineſs that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, is enhanced by thoſe very ſcorns and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50399:158"/>thoſe very afflictions. For, <hi>Our light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions which are here for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Concerning the third kind of world, namely, <hi>the Providential world,</hi> conſiſting in external diſpenſations of adverſity or proſperity. And firſt concerning the dark part of this world, namely, <hi>Adverſity,</hi> as caſualties, loſſes of wealth or friends, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the common effects whereof are impatience, diſtruſt, murmuring, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſs: Faith conquers this part of the world, and prevents thoſe evil conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which either temptations from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or corruptions from within, are apt to raiſe. 1. Faith preſents the ſoul with this aſſurance, that all external occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come from the wiſe diſpenſation or permiſſion of the moſt glorious God; they come not by chance. 2. That the glorious God may, even upon the account of his own Sovereignty, and <hi>pro imperio,</hi> inflict what he pleaſeth upon any of his creatures in this life. 3. That yet, whatſoever he doth in this kind, is not only an effect of his power and ſovereignty, but of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yea and of his goodneſs and bounty. No affliction can befall any man but it may be uſeful for his inſtruction or prevention.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:50399:158"/>4. That the beſt of men deſerve far worſe at the hands of God than the worſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that ever did or ever can befall any man in this life. 5. That there have been examples of greater affliction, that have befallen better men in this life: witneſs <hi>Job,</hi> and that excellent pattern of all pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and goodneſs, even as a man, our Lord Chriſt Jeſus. 6. That theſe afflictions are ſent for the good even of good men; and it is their fault and weakneſs, if they have not that effect. 7. That in the midſt of the ſevereſt afflictions, the favour of God to the ſoul, diſcovering it ſelf like the Sun ſhining through a cloud, gives light and comfort to the Soul. 8. That Almighty God is ready to ſupport them, that believe in him, and to bear them up under all their afflictions, that they ſhall not ſink under them. 9. That whatſoever or how great ſoever the afflictions of this life are, if the name be blaſted with reproaches, the eſtate waſted and conſumed by fire from heaven, if friends are loſt, if hopes and expectations diſappointed, if the body be macerated with pains and diſeaſes, yet Faith preſents to the believer ſomething, that can bear up the Soul under theſe, and many more preſſures, namely, that after a few years or days are ſpent, an eternal
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:50399:159"/>ſtate of unchangeable and perfect happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall ſucced; that death the worſt of temporal evils will cure all thoſe mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and deliver up the ſoul into a ſtate of endleſs comfort and bleſſedneſs: and therefore he bears all this with patience, and quietneſs, and contentedneſs, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and diſappoints the world in that expectation wherein its ſtrength, in relation to this condition, lyes, namely, it conquers all impatience, murmuring, unquietneſs of mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond part of this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential world, namely <hi>Proſperity,</hi> which in truth is the more dangerous condition of the two, without the intervention of the divine grace, the foils that the world puts upon men by this condition, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly pride, inſolence, carnal ſecurity, contempt or neglect of duty and religion, luxury, and the like. The method whereby Faith overcometh this part of the world and thoſe evil conſequences that ariſe upon (it) are theſe: 1. Faith gives a man a true and equal eſtimate of this condition, and keeps a man from overvaluing it or himſelf for it; lets him know it is very uncertain, very caſual, very dangerous, and cannot out-laſt this life: death will come and ſweep down all theſe cobwebs.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:50399:159"/>2. Faith aſſures him that Almighty God obſerves his whole deportment in it, that he hath given him a law of humility, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, temperance, fidelity, and a caution not to truſt in uncertain riches; that he muſt give an account of his ſtewardſhip alſo to the great Maſter of the Family of Heaven and Earth, that he will duly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all his <hi>Items,</hi> whether done according to his Lord's commiſſion and command; and it lets him know that the more he hath, the greater ought his care to be, becauſe his account will be the greater. 3. Faith lets him know, that the abundance of wealth, honour, power, friends, applauſe, ſucceſſes, as they laſt no longer than this ſhort tranſitory life, and therefore cannot make up his happineſs, no nor give a man an eaſe or reſcue from a fit of the Stone, or Colick; ſo there is an everlaſting ſtate of happineſs or miſery that muſt attend every man after death: And on the one hand, all the glory, and ſplendor, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that this inferior world can afford, is nothing, in compariſon of that glory, that ſhall be revealed to, and enjoyed by them, that believe and obey. 1. Nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its duration; if a man ſhould live a thouſand years, yet that muſt have an end, and the very pre-apprehenſion of an end is
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50399:160"/>enough to daſh, and blaſt, and wither any happineſs even while it is enjoyed; but that happineſs that ſucceeds after death is an everlaſting happineſs. 2. Nothing in reſpect of its degree; there is no ſincere, complete, perfect happineſs in this world; it is mingled with evils, with fears, with viciſſitudes of ſorrow and trouble; but the happineſs of the next life is perfect, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and unmixed with any thing that may allay it: And upon theſe accounts, faith, which is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen; and therefore by a kind of anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gives a preſence to the Soul of thoſe future joys, renders the beſt happineſs this world below can yield, but languid and poor, like the light of a Candle in the preſence of the Sun. On the other ſide, the miſery that after death attends the miſpent preſent life, over-ballanceth all the good that this life can yield, both in its degree and duration, and therefore, with the pre-apprehenſion of it, it ſowres and allays all the good that is in the greateſt happineſs of this life. 4. Faith doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſute every believing Soul, that, as ſure as he now liveth, and enjoyeth that worldly felicity it hath, ſo ſurely, if he, in belief and obedience to the will of God revealed
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50399:160"/>in and through Chriſt, ſhall uſe his ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardſhip thereof ſoberly, faithfully, and obediently, he ſhall enjoy that everlaſting happineſs that thus out-weigheth the beſt temporal felicity: And on the other ſide, if he ſhall uſe his proſperous condition vainly, proudly, inſolently, unfaithfully, intemperately, this ſhort felicity, that he hath here, ſhall be attended with an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and exceſſive miſery unto all eternity. And now thus upon theſe accounts and methods faith overcometh this world of external proſperity. The corruption in the heart, and the temptations of the evil one, and of evil men, would preſently improve this condition to make the man proud, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, intemperate, luxurious, ſecure, truſting in incertain riches, forgetful of God, and of Religion: But, by the means before mentioned, faith conquers the world herein, diſappoints the corruption of the heart, the ſubtilty of the devil, the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of evil men, and brings the man into a low eſteem of his own external happineſs; keeps him in a high and juſt valuation of Heaven; keeps him temperate, ſober, watchful, humble, faithful, juſt; makes him mindful of his account, and ſtudious, and induſtrious for the attaining and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of an everlaſting ſtate of happineſs,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50399:161"/>and that when death ſhall render all his wealth, and honour, and applauſe, and ſucceſſes, and glory, to be poor, empty, inſipid things, yet he may have and enjoy a fixed, permanent, everlaſting ſtate of bleſſedneſs and glory with the ever-glorious God, the bleſſed Redeemer, the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and the Spirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

            <p>Pride and Humility are two oppoſite habits or diſpoſitions of the mind: and therefore the diſcuſſion and examination of the latter, will of it ſelf give me a diſcovery of the former; and the diſcovery of the benefits and advantage of the virtue of Humility, will give us alſo an
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50399:162"/>account of the miſchiefs and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Pride, that is its oppoſite vice.</p>
            <p>In the examination of the true nature of Humility, we muſt take notice that there are <hi>two, Extremes,</hi> and between theſe the virtue of Humility is placed.</p>
            <p>The two Extremes are in the exceſs, which is Pride; and in the defect, Baſeneſs of mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pride</hi> ariſeth from an over-valuation of a man's ſelf, or a want of a due ſenſe of his dependency upon Almighty God. And, though all pride be an extreme fooliſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of the mind, yet ſome kind of pride is far more unreaſonable and vain than other; namely, that kind of pride, that ariſeth upon ſuch objects, that are leſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable in themſelves, or leſs his own that grows proud of them.</p>
            <p>It is a fooliſh thing for a man to be proud of the <hi>Endowments</hi> of his <hi>Mind;</hi> as Wit, Memory, Judgment, Prudence, Policy, Learning, nay of a man's Goodneſs, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Juſtice, Temperance, Integrity: for though theſe be moſt a man's own, yet he hath them by the Bounty and Goodneſs of that God, to whom he owes his being; what haſt thou which thou haſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Theſe are matters indeed to ſtir up thy Gratitude to the Giver of them,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50399:162"/>but not ſufficient grounds to make thee proud. Again, though the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be excellent, and more thine than any other outward things, yet thou art but a temporary owner of them; a violent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or a fit of a Palſie, or Apoplexy, may rob thee of all theſe endowments, and thou mayſt poſſibly over-tune thy Wit, thy Parts, thy Learning; and if thou eſcapeſt theſe concuſſions, yet if thou live to old age (a thing that naturally all men deſire) that will abate, if not wholly antiquate, thy Wit, Learning, Parts; and 'tis a fooliſh thing for a man to be proud of that which he is not ſure to keep while he lives, and muſt loſe at laſt in a great meaſure when he dyes, even by reaſon of that very pride which accompanies them here. Again, that very pride, which accompanies thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts and habits, is the very thing that either ſpoils, or very much debaſeth, and diſparageth both in the ſight of God and man; it is like the dead flies in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the worms at the bottom of the gourd, that taints and withers theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and renders them either contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible, or at leaſt much leſs valuable. The more a man values himſelf for thoſe things, the leſs he is valued by others; and it is a thouſand to one that this fooliſh vain
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50399:163"/>humor of pride mingles ſome odd, faneiful, ridiculous, or unſavoury ingredients in the actions or deportments of ſuch men though of eminent parts and abilities, that they receive more reproach or cenſure by their pride, than they receive applauſe by their parts; for as God reſiſts the proud ſo doth mankind alſo, and their very pride gives their adverſaries advantage. And as pride of parts and habits of the mind, is a fooliſh thing, ſo pride of <hi>bodily endowments</hi> is yet more fooliſh and vain; becauſe it is raiſed upon a thing of a baſer allay than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; ſuch as are Beauty, Stature, Strength, Agility; for though theſe are a man's own, yet they are things that are, not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to more caſualties than the former, but they are but of an inferiour nature.</p>
            <p>Again, yet more vain and fooliſh is that pride, that is raiſed upon <hi>things</hi> that are either purely <hi>Adventitious</hi> or <hi>Forein,</hi> or in the meer power of other men; as pride of Wealth, of Honour, of Applauſe, of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident Succeſſes in actions, of Titles, gay Clothes, many Attendants, great Equipage, Precedency, and ſuch like acceſſions: And yet it is admirable to obſerve the Vanity of the generality of mankind, in this reſpect; there is ſcarce a man to be found abroad in the world, who hath not ſome elation
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:50399:163"/>of mind, upon the account of theſe and the like petty, vain, inconſiderable advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; in all profeſſions, as well Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as Secular; in all ranks and degrees of men, from the Courtier to the Page and Foot-boy; in all ages, as well old, as young; almoſt every perſon hath ſome hobby-horſe or other wherein he prides himſelf.</p>
            <p>And this humor of pride doth rarely contain it ſelf within the breaſt of that perſon wherein it lodgeth, (though it went no farther it is fooliſh enough) but ſpreads it ſelf into numerous <hi>Branches;</hi> ſuch as are contempt and ſcorn of others, contention and animoſity againſt thoſe, that in any degree croſs them; ambition, envy againſt any that are above them; vain-glory and oſtentation, hunting after applauſe; deſire and delight in flattery and adulation of them; impatience of control, or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or diſappointment of what they affect; detraction from the worth or value of others.</p>
            <p>And, beſides the diſturbance that it makes abroad, it is an untollerable Diſeaſe in the Soul that is poſſeſſed therewith, renders his life miſerable, and puts him in the power of every man to be his tormentor: If a poor man, a <hi>Mordecai,</hi> deny but his cap or his knee, it makes <hi>Haman</hi> ſtark ſick and half mad, <hi>Heſt. 5.13.</hi> all his Honour and Glory
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50399:164"/>and Favour avail not, ſo long as <hi>Mordecai</hi> ſate in the Gate, and did him no reverence: any ſmall neglect or affront; any croſs in expectation; any little inconſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment in what he ſets his mind upon, diſorders him even to diſtraction.</p>
            <p>The other Extreme is <hi>Baſeneſs and Sordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind,</hi> which though it carries the ſhadow of humility, yet it is quite another thing. And though ſometimes, as in pride, ſo in this of baſeneſs of mind, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and temperament may have an influence, yet it is moſt commonly upon another account; namely, when a man is forlornly given over to the love of Wealth or Honour or bodliy Pleaſures or Luſts, this doth make him proſtitute himſelf to any baſe ſordid means, or compliances, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and attain thoſe ends; there is nothing ſo baſe, or unworthy, that ſuch a man will not undertake, or do, to the attainment of what he thus deſigns; ſuch as are baſe Flattery of Men in Power; ugly Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with their humors, though moſt nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous, unſavoury; creeping and cringing even almoſt to Adoration of them; making pitiful Addreſſes to their meaneſt depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, even as low as Pages and Foot-boys, performing the moſt unwarrantable offices for them; and many times an external diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50399:164"/>a ſhape of lowlineſs and humility in geſture, ſhape, habits and deportment, till they can attain their ends; like the Monk, that was always looking upon the earth, in a ſhape of humility, till he was choſen Abbot, and then changed his figure, and being queſtioned for his ſudden change by one of his Covent, anſwered, in his former poſture he was only looking for the keys of the Abbey, but now he had found them, he needed not the former poſture.</p>
            <p>And this baſeneſs of mind is many times alſo the effect of the Fear of Men, which many times works ſo much upon the mind, that it carries men to baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy compliances. But <hi>true Humility</hi> is a virtue and temper of mind of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ariſing from better principles. It is a lowly frame and habit of ſpirit ariſing from the due ſenſe of the Glorious Excellency of the Almighty God, and our own frailty and infirmity, and our infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite dependence upon his Bounty, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Mercy, whereby we are under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, firm, and ſound conviction, that all the good that is in us, or that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, or can be expected by us, is from the free and undeſerved liberality of that Glorious God.</p>
            <p>So that although, poſſibly the helps of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50399:165"/>complexion, and conſtitution, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may be contributory to the more eaſie acqueſt and exerciſe of this virtue; yet it is in it ſelf the effect of a mind truly, and foundly principled, the Spirit of a ſound mind. And this humility of mind is not barely in the external habit or counterfeited deportment: many times a Cynical, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable Pride is clothed with the mantle of Humility: but principally <hi>it</hi> is rooted in the very mind it ſelf, and for the moſt part <hi>evidenceth its being</hi> by theſe enſuing particulars: 1. A moſt awful and ſincere <hi>Reverence 0130 0 and Fear of the Great and Glorious God,</hi> a habitual proſtration of our ſouls always before him, as the great and glorious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of Heaven and Earth, in whoſe preſence we always are, and to whom we owe an infinite ſubjection and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A moſt high and conſtant <hi>Gratitude and Thankfulneſs</hi> of heart and ſoul to him, for all the good we have in us, or that is or can be enjoyed by us, recognizing <hi>him,</hi> as the giver of our Being, of our Faculties, our abilities, and ſtrength of Mind and Body, our Wealth, our Honour, our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, our Hope and Expectations; that he is not only the giver of them, but the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50399:165"/>Lord of them, and as may reſume them when he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And conſequently upon this, that we owe to that great and Sovereign Lord a due <hi>Employment of all,</hi> that he hath thus given us, <hi>to his Glory and Service;</hi> and that we muſt therefore be accountable for them, to him who is our great Lord or Proprietor and Maſter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A conſtant <hi>Vigilancy and Attention</hi> of mind upon all our thoughts, words and actions; but eſpecially, leſt we forget that habitude of mind that we thus owe to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and leſt pride, arrogancy, vanity, or vain-glory ſteal in upon us; checking and plucking up the firſt ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions and riſings, the firſt buds and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Which is but the conſequence of the former, <hi>a Sober Opinion concerning our ſelves</hi> and all we can do, and ſay; not thinking of our ſelves above what we ought to think: and, ſince ſelf-love ſo naturally adheres to us, to be very jealous over our ſelves; eſpecially in thoſe actions that are good, or that meet with ſome applauſe in the world, leſt we either value them too high, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value our ſelves by reaſon of them, or leſt we are ſhort in giving to Almighty God that Honour that is due to him, and to him only, for them.</p>
            <pb n="308" facs="tcp:50399:166"/>
            <p n="6">6. A diligent, and impartial, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Conſideration, and Examination, and Animadverſion of, and upon, our defects and failings;</hi> for theſe, and theſe only are truly and properly our own. There are a ſort of artificial Pictures, that if a man look upon them one way, they repreſent ſome beautiful comely perſon; but if we look upon them another way, they preſent ſome deformed miſhapen Monſter: Our own partiality to our ſelves prompts us to look upon the Picture of our lives and actions, in that poſition or poſture that renders no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but beautiful and virtuous; and we have ſeldom the patience to look upon it, in that poſition that may render our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities and Vices; and thereupon we give our ſelves the denomination accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly of Good and Virtuous, and either do not obſerve, or do not conſider our own failings and defects. If we did as well conſider our ſins which we commit, as the duties which we perform: and if in the conſideration of our duties, we did but conſider how much more of duties we omit than we perform; and in the duties we perform, if we did conſider how much dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, formality, hypocriſie, vain-glory, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking, and other unhandſom ingredients were mingled with them; and ſhould lay
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50399:166"/>our ſins, our omiſſions, our defects in one ſcale, and that which were really and truly duty, and good, and worthy in another ſcale, the beſt of mankind would ſoon find that that which was truly good, in the whole courſe of his life, were a pitiful, ſlender ſcantlet, and would be infinitely out-weighed by his ſins, omiſſions, and defects; and the due compariſon and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this, would quickly give him a Lecture of Humility; the Good we do would indeed make us Thankful, but the good we omit, the evil we commit, and the deficiencies of our duties, would make us Humble.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Charitable Opinions</hi> of the perſons <hi>of others,</hi> as far as poſſible may be. It is true that neither Religion, nor Charity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or allows, any man to ſay or think that that which is in it ſelf a ſin, is not ſo; as that Drunkenneſs and Whoredom, or Pride, or Vain-glory are not ſins; the Law of God, and the Law of Nature tells us they are ſins: But an Humble man, ſenſible of his own ſins and failings, will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be over-cenſorious of perſons, or pronounce them reprobates, or men wholly deſtitute of the hope of ſalvation; but will pity their failings and backſlidings; but yet not exterminate them from heaven.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:50399:167"/>And herein there muſt be duly conſidered the difference between a private perſon and a publick perſon, whether Miniſter or Magiſtrate; the former, namely, a private perſon, humility muſt teach him compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, charitableneſs, gentleneſs; but the latter, being intruſted in a publick mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration or office, doth <hi>alternis vicibus agere,</hi> his perſonal humility, as a private perſon, muſt teach him to be charitable, but yet not to be remiſs or unfaithful in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his office.</p>
            <p>The farther conſideration of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and companions of humility will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the conſideration of the <hi>Fruits, and Advantages, and Benefits of true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe I ſhall reduce to theſe <hi>three Relations;</hi> I. in relation to Almighty God; 3. in relation to the humble perſon himſelf, 3. in relation to others. It is true that all Virtues, if they be true and real, have a connexion one with another; they are never ſingle; for the ſame principle that begetteth one, begetteth all the reſt, and habituates, and influenceth the ſoul in all its motions; but eſpecially this Virtue of Humility, when it (is) genuine and true, is ever accompanied with all thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Habits and Graces, that perfect the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:50399:167"/>ſoul; as the Fear and Love of God; Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him; Dependence on him; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and Charity to mankind, and the like. But yet in purſuit of the fruits and advantages of Humility, I ſhall apply my ſelf to ſuch as do moſt naturally, and with a kind of ſpecial reaſon and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation, belong to, or flow from, this virtue as ſuch, and as do belong to its nature in a kind of abſtract conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, in relation <hi>to Almighty God,</hi> the Humble Man hath in a ſpecial manner theſe <hi>two</hi> great Advantages: 1. He receives Grace or Favour or Honour from God; 2. He receives Direction, Guidance and Counſel from God: Both which are ſingularly promiſed, and, by a kind of ſuitableneſs and congruity, conferred by Almighty God upon his humble ſoul.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Favour, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> from God is a ſpecial portion of the Humble Man. The Wiſe man tells us here, <hi>He gives Grace to the Humble.</hi> And although Grace is a comprehenſive word, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it ſelf, not only Favour and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, but alſo thoſe other acceſſions of the gifts of his Bounty and Goodneſs, which come from this Great Giver of every perfect gift; as Wiſdom, Peace, Righteouſneſs, Purity of heart,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:50399:168"/>and the like, which are all alſo the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a truly humble man; yet I think the former is that which is ſpecially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here; namely Favour, Honour, and Acceptance with God, ſo often expreſſed in the Old and New Teſtament, by the phraſe of finding Grace in the ſight of God: <hi>Gen. 19. 18. Behold now I have found grace in thy ſight.</hi> Luk. 14. 9, 10, 11. <hi>He that bid thee ſhall ſay unto thee, Friend, come thou up hither, then thou ſhalt have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or grace in the preſence of them that ſit at meat with thee; for he that exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall be abaſed, and be that abaſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall be exalted.</hi> So that by Grace is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended principally Favour, Acceptance, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Eſteem with the Great and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God of Heaven and Earth: And certainly were there no other reward of Humility, than Acceptance and Favour with the Great Sovereign of the World, it were reward enough. We ſee daily what pains, and charge, and expence, and ſervitude men undergo, to attain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a Prince or great man, though he be but a poor mortal worm; and how men pleaſe themſelves, when they have attained ſome little unprofitable reſpect from a great man: But what is that in compariſon of being in Grace and Favour
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:50399:168"/>with the King of kings, the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Eſpecially, when we conſider that the Favour or Acceptance of the Glorious God is not a bare unprofitable Eſteem or Grace, ſuch as many times the great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of Princes obtain from them: But the favour and acceptance of God is always accompanied with Bounty and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence; As he is the Sovereign Ocean of all good, ſo we may be ſure, he will be communicative and liberal of it, to ſuch as he favours. He, whoſe benignity is hourly extended to the meaneſt of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nay to the very worſt of men, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be parſimonious or ſtrait-handed to thoſe whom he accepts, and eſteems, and honours. So that the humble man finds Grace in the ſight of the Glorious God, and, as an Effect of that grace, the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful communication of all neceſſaries, good, from the Munificence, Bounty and Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of him, that thus favours him: and this is reward enough for the moſt profound Humility.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reaſon why</hi> Almighty God accepts thus an Humble perſon, is the very ſame that makes him reſiſt the Proud, which is this; The Great God made all things in the world for two Ends: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Thereby to communicate his own diffuſive Goodneſs
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:50399:169"/>and Benificence, and principally for the Glory of his own Greatneſs, Wiſdom, Power, and Majeſty; and although he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no addition of Happineſs by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Glory from his Creatures, yet it is a thing he values: his Glory he will not give to another; and it is unbecoming the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Majeſty to be diſappointed in his End. Glory is out of its place, when it is not returned to the God of Glory, or in order to him. It is the natural, as well as the reaſonable, Tribute of all his Creatures, and a kind of proper Refiection of the Bounty and Splendor of all his works unto the God that made them. Now the Proud man uſurps that Glory which is due to his Maker, and takes it to himſelf; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepts that due and natural return and reflection due unto the Creator of all things, takes that tribute that is due to God, and applies it to himſelf; puts glory out of its place and natural courſe, which it ſhould hold towards the glorious God, as the Rivers do to the Sea: And this uſurpation, as it is a kind of rebellion againſt God, ſo it inverts and diſorders the true and juſt natural courſe of things; and therefore as the proud man herein walks contrary to God, ſo God walks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him: <hi>They that honour me, I will
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50399:169"/>honour; they that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly esteemed:</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. And as this is a moſt reaſonable act of Divine Juſtice, ſo they ſeem two things, that even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an account of natural congruity muſt needs make the condition of a Proud man uneaſie and unhappy, in relation to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God: 1. Every thing is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and uſeful, and convenient in its proper place; but when it is out of its place, it becomes troubleſom and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, like a Bone out of joynt, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth diſcompoſure. When therefore the Proud man arrogates to himſelf Glory, and intercepts its free return to the God of Glory, to whom it belongs, Glory is out of its place, and diſorders, and diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the uſurper of it, ſo that he grows ſick of it, ſometimes to madneſs, but always to diſtemper and diſcompoſure. 2. The Proud man is ſo full of himſelf, and of the Honour, and Glory, which he uſurps and attracts to himſelf, that he is uncapable of an acceſſion of Grace or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from God: for he thinks he hath enough of his own, and this obſtructs the acceſſes and irradiation of the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, Grace, and Benediction. <hi>Intus exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens prohibet alienum.</hi> It is the empty Soul, empty I mean of Pride, Self-conceit, and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50399:170"/>Vain-glory, that is capable of ſatisfaction with the Divine Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>But on the contrary, <hi>the Humble man</hi> hath theſe two oppoſite advantages: 1. He carries Glory and Honour to him, to whom it belongs, to its proper center and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, namely, to the Everlaſting God, and that Ocean of Goodneſs and Perfection that reſides in him; and this gives the man eaſe, and quietneſs, and compoſure of mind; for he doth not intercept the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute that is due to his Maker, but payes it over to the right owner. If he doth any good, noble, or becoming action, he checks the firſt motion of pride and oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in himſelf, and receives not the applauſe of others, but directs all the Praiſe and Glory of it, to that God, that hath done it by him, or in him, or for him: <hi>Not unto us, but unto thy name give the Glory:</hi> And this gives him ſingular quietneſs, ſerenity, and evenneſs of mind, becauſe he is not ſurcharged with that which belongs not to him, nor under thoſe tortures and boylings of mind, which this Tribute due to his Maker raiſeth, when uſurped by a man to whom it belongs not. Again, 2. By this Humility and Lowlineſs of mind the ſoul is empty, not of what it ſhould have, but of what it ſhould not have; and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:50399:170"/>by that means becomes receptive and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bleſſing from the God of Heaven, who filleth the hungry with good things, but ſends the rich empty away. And this ſeems to hold congruity to the very nature of every Intellectual agent, that acts with an Underſtanding and Will: We find, even in the regulated motions of our own nature, a ſecret averſneſs to gratifie a proud and haughty man; for he either ſcorns or rejects a kindneſs, as beneath him; or arrogates and owns it as his due, and not a bounty: But a perſon truly humble is ſenſible of a benefit, thankful for it, gets within us, invites benificence. And ſurely, though the bleſſed God be not at all under the impotency of humane paſſions, yet he is a God of infinite Wiſdom, and placeth his beſt benefits, where they will be beſt received and uſed. 2. It ſeems to hold congruity and proportion with the very courſe and nature of things natural: The Divine Benignity is much more diffuſive than the Light, the Air, the moſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Element, and filleth every thing according to its meaſure and capacity of reception; is that which communicateth it ſelf to Vegetables in life and vegetation, but not in ſenſe, becauſe not receptive of it; to Animals, in life and ſenſe, but not
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50399:171"/>in reaſon or underſtanding, becauſe not receptive of it; to Man in life, ſenſe and underſtanding that is common to the whole ſpecies; and if they have but room in them for it, and do not wilfully throw it from them, in grace alſo and favour and acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, in the bettering and improving of their Soul, in the influences of his love, direction and guidance: And ſuch a veſſel is the humble Soul, empty of Pride, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attribution, Vain-glory; one that is glad of ſuch gueſts, as the Grace and Favour and Acceptance of God; hath room for them in his heart, and ſo becomes a fit Tabernacle for the Influences of that God, that revives the ſpirit of the humble. <hi>Iſa. 57.15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here by the Benignity and Favour of God I do not mean heaping of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Honours or Wealth upon men; theſe are but ſmall inconſiderable things; ſuch as are common to proud, and many times denied to the humble: But they have a better exchange, namely, Peace with God, inward teſtimonies of his Favours, ſecret indications of his Love, directions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions by the ſecret whiſpers and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of his Spirit, quietneſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mind, and pledges of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Happineſs, thoſe.</p>
            <pb n="319" facs="tcp:50399:171"/>
            <q>
               <l>—<hi>Animi bona, ſanctoſque receſſus</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Mentis, &amp; incoctum generoſo pectus honeſto.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>And theſe are things of a far greater value than external Weath and Honour; and as far before them, as the Mind and Soul it ſelf is. But of this more in the next.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond great advantage of the humble ſoul is, that he ſhall be ſure of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> and <hi>Guidance</hi> and <hi>Counſel</hi> from the beſt of Counſellors, the glorious God of Wiſdom; <hi>Pſal. 25.9. The meek will he guide in judgment; the meek will he teach his way.</hi> Meekneſs and Humility are but the ſame thing under different names.</p>
            <p>And this guidance and direction of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is of <hi>two kinds,</hi> relating to a double end: 1. Guidance and direction in relation to his Everlaſting End, the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Happineſs of the Soul; namely, what he is to Believe, and Know, and Do, in order to that greateſt and important End. And therefore it is obſervable that although the Myſtery of the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus, the common Inſtrument of the Salvation of mankind, is the moſt wiſe and profound Deſign and Myſtery, and of the greateſt importance that ever the world was acquainted with; yet the moſt Wiſe
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:50399:172"/>and moſt Glorious God did vail and dreſs that great and glorious Myſtery quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Wiſdom and Grandeur of the World; inſomuch that to the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people of the world, and that were full of their own Knowledge, the <hi>Jews,</hi> it became a ſtumbling-block; and to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the moſt learned and wiſe people in the world, and that were full of the ſenſe of their own Wiſdom and Learning, it was accounted fooliſhneſs; 1 <hi>Cor. 1. After that by wiſdom the world knew not God, it pleaſed him by the folliſhneſs of preaching,</hi> namely, of the things preached, Chriſt Crucified, <hi>to ſave them that believe:</hi> And accordingly in the Primitive Times it ſucceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the Wiſe Rabbies of the <hi>Jews</hi> and the Learned Philoſophers of the Gentiles, for the moſt part, derided or rejected it: Not many Wiſe, not many Mighty entertained it; for the Wiſdom of God ordered the Wiſdom and Myſtery of the Goſpel quite counter to that wiſdom that was in vogue in the World: And we now ſee the reaſon why it was fitly and wiſely ſo deſigned, for it was deſigned to thwart and croſs and confound that corrupt Wiſdom of the world, which had before corrupted the world by Wiſdom and knew not God. But on the contrary, the Meek and Humble
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:50399:172"/>and Lowly minds, and ſuch were ſome learned, as well as unlearned, theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Goſpel: <hi>The Poor receive the Goſpel;</hi> the poor in ſpirit, lowly, meek: <hi>He that receiveth not the kingdom of God as a little child, ſhall in no wiſe enter into it.</hi> It was fitted, and ordered, and modeled in ſuch a dreſs, and ſuch a method, that it was ſuitable to the reception of ſuch Souls, and none but ſuch were receptive of it.</p>
            <p>Again, humility diſpoſeth the Glorious God to give, and the humble mind to receive direction and guidance in all the walk and concern of this life. A proud heart ordinarily diſdaineth and underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lueth all other wiſdom but his own, and all other counſel but ſuch as ſuits with his own Wiſdom: And therefore the moſt Glorious God moſt commonly croſſeth and diſappointeth him, or leaves him to the headineſs and miſery of his own counſels, and to eat the bitter fruit of his own raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly. For, whatever the blind men of the world think, the actions of men and their ſucceſſes are under the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Divine Will and Providence; and it is no wonder if he, that inviſibly governs the Events of the world, take the wiſe in their own craftineſs, and mingles
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:50399:173"/>giddineſs and diſappointment in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fels, and breaks the head of all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances; for he hath a thouſand ways with eaſe and facility to do it. We may every day ſee what ſmall intervention quite ſhatters, and diſorders, and overturns the moſt politick, ſubtil, ſecret, and well laid deſigns in the world: ſo that in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a pitiful ſmall unexpected occurrence wholly breaks in pieces a deſign of men laid together with long deliberation and forecaſt; with huge proſpect and precaution of difficulties; with great reſerves and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations againſt all imaginable obſtacles; with all the advantages of ſecreſie, power, combination of parties, connexion and contignation of ſubſidiary ayds; and yet one poor unthought of accident cracks in ſunder, and breaks all to ſhivers the whole elaborate <hi>Machina;</hi> ſo that in a moment the ſhivers thereof lye all broken and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted like a potſhered daſht againſt a wall; or the whole contrivance diſappears like the fabulous enchanted Caſtles.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, an humble man leans not to his own underſtanding; he is ſenſible of the deficiency of his own power and wiſdom, and truſts not in it; he is alſo ſenſible of the all-ſufficient Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of Almighty God, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:50399:173"/>commits himſelf to him for Counſel, Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, Direction, and Strength. It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for any man or thing, that is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his own deficiency, to ſeek out after that which may be a ſupport and ſtrength to him; and as Almighty God is eſſentially Good and Perfect, ſo he is (if I may uſe the expreſſion) moſt Naturally Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative of it, to any that ſeeks unto him for it in humility and ſincerity: The Air doth not more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally yield to our attraction in reſpiration, <note place="margin">v. <hi>Antonin. 1.8</hi> ſe. 45.

I can call <hi>my own Experience</hi> to witneſs, that even in the External actions, occurrences, and incidences of my whole Life, I was never diſappointed of the beſt Guidance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, when in Humility and ſenſe of my own deficiency, and diffidence of my own ability to direct my ſelf, or to grapple with the difficulties of my Life, I have with
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50399:174"/>humility and ſincerity implored the ſecret Direction and Guidance of the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Providence: And I dare therein appeal to the vigilant and ſtrict obſervation of any man's Experience, whether he hath not found the ſame Experience in relation to himſelf, and his own actions and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and whether thoſe counſels and purpoſes which have been taken up after an humble invocation of the Divine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection have not always been moſt ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as this Humility is of admirable uſe, in relation to the Glorious God and the Effluxes of his Bleſſing and Direction; ſo it is of ſingular advantage, in relation <hi>to the Humble man himſelf,</hi> as may appear in theſe enſuing Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Humility keeps the Soul in great <hi>Evenneſs</hi> and <hi>Tranquility:</hi> the truth is, that the ſtorms and tempeſts and diſorders of the Soul do not ſo much (if at all) ariſe from the things without us, as from the paſſions and diſtempers of the Soul it ſelf, eſpecially that of Pride and Haughtineſs, which as the Wiſe man ſays, is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Contention, and that within the very Soul it ſelf, as without it is that which blows up the paſſions of Anger, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and Envy, and Hatred, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50399:174"/>and Ambition, and Vain-glory; and from hence it is that the paſſions do rage, and ſwell, and roll one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like the Sea troubled with a ſtorm. What is it, that upon any diſgrace, or diſrepute, or affront put upon a man, makes him vex himſelf, even to death, that he hath not leiſure ſcarce for one quiet or compoſed thought? What is <hi>it</hi> that makes him jealous of another man's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement; that makes him hate and envy another that hath attained greater dignity than himſelf; that makes his thoughts and endeavours reſtleſs, till he get to be greater or richer than others; and yet when he hath attained not reſting in it, but ſtill aſpiring higher; that fills him with fears, and torturing cares, leſt he ſhould either miſs what he aims at, or loſe what he hath attained; that fills him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge againſt all that oppoſe him, or ſtand in his way, with impatience under any croſs or diſappointment, many times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the extremity of madneſs and frenzy; that makes him unquiet and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with his preſent condition, and raiſeth a thouſand ſuch diſorders and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſures in the minds of men? All theſe are moſt plainly reſolvable into this curſed diſtemper of Pride and Haughtineſs
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50399:175"/>of mind, as might moſt evidently be made out to any that will but trace back theſe diſorders unto their root and original; and certainly therefore the ſtate of ſuch a man's mind muſt needs be marvelous diſorderly and unhappy.</p>
            <p>But Humility cures this diſeaſe, this Feaver of the mind; keeps the paſſions cool, and calm, and quiet, and low, and keeps under hourly diſcipline, throws cold water upon them. Have I received an affront, a diſgrace with great men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt from my equal or inferiour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and ſcandal, diſappointment in my expectation of ſome external advantage? Am I like to be turned out of office, to be made poor, or the like? I have two Conſiderations, that keep me ſtill in an equal temper, and that ſilence all thoſe paſſions, which preſently in a proud man would be all on fire, and in a hurly-burly: 1. I know that thoſe things come not without the Divine commiſſion, or at leaſt permiſſion; and ſhall I not quietly ſubmit to that will of my great Sovereign Lord, to whom I owe myſelf, and whoſe will I pray daily may be done? It was an adorable inſtance of this humility in <hi>David,</hi> when, to add to his preſent ſad condition, <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed him ſo bitterly,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:50399:175"/>and although he had power and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>left him to revenge it, yet he forbad it, for it may be the Lord hath bid <hi>Shimei</hi> curſe. And again, 2. What am I, that I muſt not be croſſed, or reproached, or contemned, or diſappointed? Alas, a poor weak ſinful man, I cannot be made lower in the eſteem of the world, than I am in my own. If the world reproach, ſpoil me of what I have; if I am poor, or ſcorned, it is but what I deſerve, and leſs than I deſerve for my ſins at the hand of God: Though perchance I am ſlandered, or falſly accuſed by them, yet I know ill enough of my ſelf to make me bear patiently even a falſe accuſation; and they cannot make me more low, and vile, in the eſteem of others, than I am in my own. And thus Humility breaks and quenches the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and keeps the mind ſerene and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed under all external occurrencies. But to deſcend to particulars more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Humility gives <hi>Contentation in any condition or ſtation.</hi> And the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe an humble mind is never above that ſtation or condition of life that the Divine Providence orders, but rather under or below it, or at the moſt holds pace with it. When the mind runs beyond the condition
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:50399:176"/>of a man, it is like a ſpend-thrift, that lives beyond his Eſtate, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes neceſſarily poor, and never enjoys what it hath, becauſe it buſies it ſelf ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in anxious purſuit of what it hath not: And that mind, that in relation to the things of the world, runs beyond its ſtation, can never be contented nor quiet; and though he attain this year, what he anxiouſly purſued the laſt year, yet ſtill his mind will be running farther, and ſtill keep before his acqueſts, as the fore-wheel of the Coach will ſtill run before the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-wheel: But an humble man is ever contented, with what the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Honeſt Induſtry allotts him, and enjoys it comfortably and thankfully, and can ſit down with a narrow fortune with this contenting contemplation, That which I have is given by the Bountiful God, of liberality, not of debt; if I had leſs, it were more than I could deſerve; for I can with <hi>Jacob</hi> ſay, out of the ſenſe of my own unworthineſs, I am leſs than the leaſt of all thy mercies, bleſſed therefore be his name.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Humility gives always <hi>Patience under all Adverſity</hi> of what kind ſoever it be; and this is always an effect and companion of true humility <hi>upon theſe enſuing Conſiderations:</hi>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:50399:176"/>1. The greateſt cauſe of Impatience is not ſo much, from the preſſure and force of any external croſs or calamity, as from the great diſturbance and reluctance of the mind of him that ſuffers it; and this it is that raiſeth up the waves and billows within: the croſs or calamity it may be is rough and beyond the power of him that ſuffers it to extricate or control: And on the other ſide, when it meets with a mind as tumultuous and contumacious as the calamity or croſs, it raiſeth a ſtorm, as when the wind and tide are contrary, or like that ſtate of <hi>Paul's</hi> voyage in the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, where two Seas met, <hi>Act. 27.</hi> which oftentimes endangers the veſſel. He that violently and impetuouſly contends againſt a calamity, is like one bound with a ſtrong yoak or bond, his ſtrugling, like a wild Bull in a net, galls him more than the yoak it ſelf otherwiſe would do; and a proud and haughty ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, commonly miſcalled courage, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes more to his own uneaſineſs than his croſs doth: But an humble, lowly mind is naturally more able to bear his croſs with more patience, becauſe it is evident that the ſoftneſs, humility, and quietneſs, and calmneſs of his mind breaks the force of the calamity, and renders it more eaſie
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50399:177"/>by ſubmiſſion to it. 2. Again, every true humble man looks upon the worſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he is under, to be leſs than he deſerves. As long as a man lives in the world, there is no condition ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and painful, and uneaſie, but it may be worſe; and an humble man always thinks that that condition or circumſtance of his life, which may be worſe, is not the worſt that he deſerves. It may be I am poor, but yet I am well eſteemed, I deſerve both poverty and diſeſteem; it may be I am poor, and under a cloud alſo of ignominy and reproach, yet I have my health of body, and compoſedneſs and ſteadineſs of mind, and this is more than I deſerve: It may be I am, with <hi>Job,</hi> under a confluence and complication of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, loſs of Eſtate, of Children and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, cenſured by my very friends as an hypocrite and one under the diſpleaſure of Almighty God, my body macerated with diſeaſes, yet I have life, and where there is life there is hope; <hi>Wherefore doth the living man complain, a man for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſins?</hi> Lam. 3.39. the living man hath no cauſe to complain, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſuffer the loſs of all other things, yet his life is ſpared and given him for a prey. The humble man is patient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:50399:177"/>under his ſufferings of any kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he carries with him the due ſenſe of his own unworthineſs and demerit, and upon a judicious account looks upon his meaneſt, loweſt, worſt condition, as bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he deſerves at the hand of God. 3. The humble man is patient under all conditions, becauſe he always bears a mind entirely ſubject and ſubmitting to the will of the great Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth, and whom he knows to be the Sovereign Lord of all his Creatures; to be the great diſpenſer or permitter and rector of all the events in the world; to be the moſt Wiſe, Juſt and Gracious God; and therefore he doth not only ſubmit to his will, as an act of Neceſſity which we cannot control, or as an act of Duty in obedience to his Sovereign, but as an act of Choice, of Prudence, and becauſe the will of his Maker is wiſer than his own, and more eligible than his own; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he makes the will of his Maker his own choice, and upon the account of true judgment concludes that whatſoever the moſt Powerful and Irreſiſtible, the moſt Wiſe and Prudent, the moſt Juſt and Merciful Will of God appoints for him, is not only fit for him to ſubmit unto, but alſo to chooſe, and as well cheerfully and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:50399:178"/>thankfully, as patiently and quietly to follow and elect: And therefore ſince he well knows that all the ſucceſſes of his life are under the regiment, government and providence of the moſt Glorious, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, Wiſe and Merciful God, even thoſe that ſeem in themſelves moſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, uneaſie, and grievous, he patiently and cheerfully comports with the Divine Will in the tolleration of them, and waits upon his All-ſufficiency and Goodneſs in his due time, either to remove them, or to ſupport him under them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Humility gives great <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Vigilance</hi> in the fulleſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Temporal Felicity of any kind whatſoever. There is a ſtrange Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft in Proſperity to rob a man of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: How many in the world have I in my time ſeen, that under the greateſt preſſures of croſſes and calamities, of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and reproach, have kept their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences fair and clean, their Innocence, Integrity, Piety and Goodneſs within them and about them, that yet by the warm beams and ſunſhine of external Proſperity have caſt off their Innocence, as the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller did his Cloak in the Fable, made ſhipwrack of their Conſciences, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as great oppreſſors, as diſorderly and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50399:178"/>debauched livers, as proud and inſolent, as perfect worldlings, as if they had never heard of a Heaven or a Hell, of a God or a Redeemer, or of a Judgment to come? True Humility is a great guard upon the Soul of a man againſt theſe rocks and hazards. An humble man looks upon all his plenty and proſperity, not as his own, or the reward of his deſert, but as the <hi>depoſitum</hi> of the great Maſter of the Families of Heaven and Earth, talents entruſted to him as a Steward and an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countant to employ for his Maſter's uſe, ſervice and honour, not for his own gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur or pleaſure; he conſiders the more he hath, the greater is his Account, and the greater his Charge, and in it finds no matter to advance his thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf, or to make him proud, but to make him the more careful to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it: And his humility is not dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by his plenty, but rather increaſed, and this keeps him ſober and moderate in the uſe of what he hath; for he looks upon all he hath, as none of his own, but his Maſter's; to whom he is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and as it makes him ſober and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in the uſe of what he hath, ſo it makes him ſtudious to employ it to the honour of his Maſter, and faithful in that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50399:179"/>employment. Again, as he looks upon the things of this world as depoſited in his hands for the account of his Lord, ſo he looks upon them as dangerous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to deceive him of his innocence and integrity; and both theſe make him ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſtrictly vigilant over himſelf, leſt the preſent gains and glory and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of proſperity get ground upon his mind or his virtue, eſpecially upon his humility: for worldly grandeur ſecretly ſteals away that virtue, or impairs it, fooner than any other. Pride is a kind of ſhadow, or rather a Devil, that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily haunts and waits upon worldly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and proſperity, and therefore he keeps a ſtrict guard over his heart, and watches narrowly the firſt blooming or bloſſoming of Worldly-mindedneſs, Self-dependance, Truſting in uncertain Riches, making them his Hope or his Confidence; but eſpecially upon ſwellings of Vain-glory, Pride, Self-applauſe, and thoſe other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min that commonly breed in the Soul, by the worm-influences of proſperity: and he never ſuffers theſe unclean Birds to rooſt or reſt in his Soul; checks and rejects the very firſt motions of them, and cruſhes theſe viperous eggs in the very firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: and to prevent the very firſt
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:50399:179"/>opportunities of their production, he watcheth himſelf upon all occaſions; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruouſly reflects upon the danger he is in; carefully tryes every emergent Thought, Word and Action, whether it hath any ſecret tincture of Pride or Vanity, and if he find the leaſt riſing of them, he ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and ſtifles them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Humility is an excellent <hi>Remedy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the paſſion of <hi>Fear,</hi> even of the worſt of evils, Death it ſelf, and much more againſt the fear of Reproaches, Loſſes, and all external calamities whatſoever; gives patience under an incumbent evil, doth naturally, and by a kind of neceſſary conſequences, arm a man againſt the fear of an imminent or impendent evil, and upon the very ſame grounds and reaſons, and therefore they need not be again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. Commonly Surprize and Unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedneſs of any evil renders the Fear more terrible; and becauſe it takes a man upon the ſudden, and before he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf, or rally thoſe Succours of Hope and Reaſon to ſupport him againſt it; it is like a ſudden diſeaſe, that ſurpriſeth the body that labours under ill humors, before it can allay or moderate them by preparative helps or Catharticks, whereby a ſudden combuſtion ariſeth, and many
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:50399:180"/>times more danger ariſeth from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure of the humors, than from the malignity of the diſeaſe it ſelf. But hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility keeps the mind in a ſober well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared temper; keeps the paſſions under diſcipline, and is always in a readineſs to receive the ſhock of a danger or evil im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent or impendent, without any great diſorder or aſtoniſhment: An humble man hath no ſuch great value for himſelf, as to think he is to be exempt from cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; and therefore is not much ſtartled at the approaching of them: he reckons he hath portion enough in this world, if he can keep his Innocence, the Peace of his Conſcience, and Quietneſs within; as for matters of the world, as he makes not their enjoyment the object of his hope, ſo he makes not their loſs any great motive of his fear; God's will be done is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his Soul in relation to them. Is he threatned with the Loſs of his Eſtate, of his Friends and Relations, of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Eſteem, and hath he the news of his Death either from without, by violencies or perſecution, or from within by the forerunners of it, ſickneſs or old age: yet is he by no means tormented with fear by theſe meſſengers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Evenneſs of his own mind fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:50399:180"/>him with the opportunity and uſe of his Reaſon to check his fear as a vain, fooliſh and unſerviceable paſſion, that may torment him, and by preſent antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation make his preſent condition worſe and more troubelſom, but not cure the danger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſenſe of his ſubordination to the Divine power and pleaſure, quiets his mind with this thought: My Maker wants not power to reſeue me from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if he pleaſe; but if he be not pleaſed, it is my wiſdom and my duty to ſubmit to his good pleaſure; it is the Lord that doth inflict or permit, his will be done.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Upon the approach of ſuch dangers or evils he retires into himſelf; What am I, that I ſhould think to be exempt from thoſe imminent evils. what title have I to any the leaſt good I enjoy: is it not the meer bounty of my Maker. If the danger I foreſee leave me any thing, if they leave my life, they leave me more than I deſerve; if they be ſuch as menace the loſs of that alſo, they yet cannot take away my innocence, my integrity, my peace with God, and with my ſelf; and it is an admirable bounty that the God of heaven hath preſerved that to me, and accepts this little poor ſmall good that he
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:50399:181"/>finds, or rather makes, in me, ſo as to reward with his favour and acceptation and peace with him. Good God! when I look upon that which I call my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, what a ſpotted piece it is, that I am even aſhamed to call it innocence; when I look upon my Integrity, with what a deal of ſecret hypocriſie hangs about it, that it deſerves not the name of integrity which is truly ſuch; it is his gift to me that is pleaſed to own and reward it as mine, with peace and favourable acceptance; and as long as he is pleaſed to continue to me what indeed is his, and thus to accept it as if it were my own, what reaſon have I to fear the loſs of all things elſe, even life it ſelf: ſince ſtill I enjoy much more than I deſerve, and which no man or devil, no calamity or danger, no not death it ſelf can deprive me of. And thus far of the advantages of Humility in relation to a man's ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Advantage of humility <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Others</hi> is of two kinds; 1. The advantage the humble man hath to others: 2. The advantage the humble man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from others upon the account of his Humility.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the former of theſe; we may
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:50399:181"/>brings to Mankind, by conſidering the Evil that Pride or a Proud man bringeth thereunto. If a man duly conſiders moſt of the miſchiefs that happen to mankind and follow them to their Original, he ſhall find that the moſt of them owe their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to this root. Let a man but look abroad in the world, he ſhall find a ſort of evil Spirits, or Furies in this, that fill it with infinite diſorders and miſery: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Atheiſin, Hatred, Strife, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Wars, diſparaging Powers, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, Envy, Ambition, Sedition, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Perſecution, Detraction, Slandering, Cruelty, Contempt, Uncharitableneſs, Cenſoriouſneſs, and a thouſand more ſuch deviliſh Furies, that fill the world with blood, and confuſion, and diſorder. And now let us but trace thoſe or any of thoſe to their original, we ſhall find that for the moſt (part) Pride is that <hi>Pandora's</hi> Box, out of which they ſpring and iſſue. Let us take an eſtimate of ſome of them: Atheiſm, that cuts in ſunder all the bonds of Religion, Government, and Society, whence comes it? but by the Pride of mens Hearts, that cannot endure to have a Sovereign Lord above them, but that they may be ſelf-dependent; or the Pride of mens Wits, that out of ſeorn of any
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:50399:182"/>thing they think vulgar, and to magnifie themſelves, dare attaque the moſt ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign truth in the world, the Being or Providence of God. So for Contention, Striſe, Diſobedience to Parents, Rebellion againſt Governors, they all ſpring moſt ordinarily from the ſame root of Pride: by Pride cometh Contention; men that cannot endure to be controlled, either by Laws or Governors, by Parents or Superiors, but think their own Will and Luſts muſt be the uncontrollable rule of all their actions. So again for Wars, there is rarely any war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Princes or States, but either of both ſides, or at leaſt of one ſide, Pride and Deſire of Domination is the true root and cauſe of it, though it be gilded over of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes with other pretences. Again, for the moſt part, the Diſputes among perſons of Learning, or pretending to it, ariſe from theſe luſts of Pride contending for ſovereignty in Wit or Learning, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of contradiction, eager and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, conteſting for reputation, victory, and the maintaining of what they have once aſſerted, and ſcorning the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. So that many times, upon petty, inconſiderable, unuſeful, inevident triſles, men are as hotly engaged, as if Heaven were at ſtake upon it: And from hence
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:50399:182"/>many times comes Hereſies, when men pretending to greatneſs of wit or learning, but in truth of haughty ungovernable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, either upon the ſcore of vain-glory and reputation, or upon ſome conceived affront or neglect from the Orthodox, ſet up for themſelves, draw parties to them, and begin a Scheme of Religion of their own dreſſing: From the ſame root comes Envy, Ambition, Detraction from others, becauſe they think all preferment due to their own worth, and that any good that happens to others is a kind of derogation from themſelves; aſpiring thoughts, and parties endeavouring to cruſh and ruine all that ſtand in their way to that mark of grandeur that they aim at. And the like inſtances might be given in almoſt all thoſe turbulent Luſts and Paſſions among men, that break out to the common diſturbance of mankind, and all humane Societies.</p>
            <p>And therefore certainly, whatſoever virtue or temper or habit (or whatever elſe we ſhall call it) there is, that cures this mad, unruly, and exorbitant luſt of Pride among men, muſt needs be one of the moſt benevolent, and uſeful, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous things to mankind and humane ſociety; and this is that excellent virtue
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:50399:183"/>of Humility and Lowlineſs of the mind.</p>
            <p>If this virtue did obtain among all men, it were not poſſible that thoſe bluſtering Storms, that diſquiet and diſorder man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, would be found in the world; but inſtead thereof Peace and Love, mutual offices of Kindneſs and Charity, Sweetneſs of Converſation, every one giving preſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to one another, rather than invading him, his reputation or intereſt, benificent to all.</p>
            <p>But it is true, there is little hope that all mankind will arrive to ſuch a temper; and this indeed is that which <hi>is</hi> the only conſiderable <hi>Objection</hi> againſt it, which may be thus improved: You commend Humility, as the great ſovereign Antidote againſt Pride, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſturber of mankind; and certainly what you ſay is demonſtratively true, if all the world could be perſwaded to it; but this never was, nor never can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; as there are Wolves, and Lions, and Bears, and Foxes among brutes, as well as Sheep, and other innocent brutes; and as there are Kites, and Vultures, and Hawks among birds, as well as Doves, and other innocent birds; ſo among men there ever (have been) and ever will be men of Pride and Haughtineſs, of Ambition and
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:50399:183"/>Vain-glory, of Savage and Cruel Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering ſpirits: And therefore unleſs all could be perſwaded to be Meek and Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it were as good and better that none ſhould be, upon theſe two accounts; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That as long as the moſt of mankind are guilty of this paſſion of Pride, nay if it were bmang mut an equal, nay a leſs number in proportion to thoſe that are humble and meek, the world would ſtill be as tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous as ever: a violent wind coming out of one Eaſt, would make the Sea as trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, as if it came out of a many. 2. Again, thoſe that were meek and humble would be expoſed, as a common prey, to all the reſt, and their condition would be ſo much the worſe in the world, by their humility and meekneſs: their caſe in the world would be like a fair Gameſter, that plays fairly, meeting with a foul or cheating Gameſter, he were ſure to go by the loſs: Therefore ſince Pride, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Violence, will be uſed in the world by ſome, and it may be the greateſt part of mankind, it is better to be of the ſame make, to deal with them at their own weapon, to be as proud, and conſequently as violent, as the reſt of mankind, (for it is part of the Game of the world) and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:50399:184"/>Humility makes his caſe worſe: <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terem ferendo inju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>m invit is novam.</hi> Where the Countrey is full of Wolves and Tigers, it is better be a Wolf or a Tiger, as well as they, than be a Sheep and expoted to their Violence.</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this Objection: 1. As to the former part, that though it be true, that it can never be expected that all the world ſhould be perſwaded to be Humble, no more than it can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that all ſhould be perſwaded to be Virtuous, Juſt, or Honeſt, but yet if there were ſome, though the leſſer part, of mankind truly Humble and Lowly, it would make very much to the abating of thoſe Evils that ariſe by the Pride and Haughtineſs of men: 1. Becauſe the more Humble men there are in the world, it neceſſarily follows there are the fewer Proud men, and conſequently fewer common Diſturbers of the peace and welfare of mankind and humane ſociety. 2. When the conteſt comes by the proud man againſt the proud man, indeed there is the ſame tumult between them, as if there were none humble; but when the conteſt is by the proud man againſt the humble man, the ſtrife is quickly at an end: it is a true Proverb, It is the ſecond blow makes the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:50399:184"/>ſray: the humble man gives way to the wrath and inſolence of the proud man, and thereby ends the quarrel; for <hi>Yielding pacifieth wrath,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Effleſ. 10.4</note> ſaith the Wiſe man, and I have very often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the Quietneſs of ſpirit and Humility of a man attaqued by a Proud man hath ſubdued and conquered his Pride and Animoſity to a wonder, and made him tame, that by oppoſition would have been furious and implacable. Soft words breaks the bones, <note place="margin">v. <hi>Prov. 25.15.</hi> A ſofi tongue breaketh the bone.</note> and a Sword is ſooner broken by a blow upon a Cuſhion or Pillow that yieldeth, than upon a bar of Iron that reſiſts. But if it ſhould fall out, that the Proud man's Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is not broken by the Gentleneſs and Facility of the Humble man, whereby he ſuffers in his own particular, yet there be two advantages that hereby happen to the publick: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the contention is ſoon at an end; the proud man hath got the day, and the parties are quiet. 2. It gains a ſecret compaſſion from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders to the injured humble man, and a general reſentment and deteſtation of the injury committed to the humble man that receives the injury with ſo much Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and bears it with ſo much Patience;
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:50399:185"/>and thereby Pride and Oppreſſion become the common objects of the general dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of inſolence, pride, and oppreſſion; and the generality of mankind thereupon look on them as beaſts of prey, with hatred and abhorrence, and endeavour means to ſecure themſelves againſt it. 3. A third advantage is this, That though oftentimes humble and good men are expoſed to the injuries of the proud, violent and inſolent, yet they are a kind of ferment or leaven in the places where they live, and by the ſecret influences of their virtues, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendableneſs of their converſation, and the ſecret intereſt that virtue hath in the Soul, not only of good but even of the worſt men, it doth work upon mankind, aſſimulates in ſome meaſure to it ſelf, and makes others good and humble by a kind of ſecret Magnetiſm that that virtue hath upon the minds of men: and the more ſuch are in number in the world, the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and operative their example and influence will be upon thoſe with whom they converſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the ſecond, namely, the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Detriment that the humble man receives in the world upon the very account of his humility, I anſwer; Firſt, that Detriment is abundantly recompenſed
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:50399:185"/>with the quiet and tranquility and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and compoſedneſs of his own mind: As a man poſſeſſeth his own Soul by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, ſo he doth by humility, namely, the compoſedneſs, right temper, and due eſtate of his own mind, which no proud, or violent, or impatient man doth or can. But, ſecondly, it (is) moſt certain, that though an humble man, may upon the very ſcore of his humility and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, receive a bruſh in the world, yet at the long run he gains advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, even in this preſent life. When I firſt read the ſaying of our Saviour, Matth. 5. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they (ſhall) inherit the earth;</hi> I looked upon it as a meer Paradox, if applied to the comforts of this life, and therefore thought it muſt be meerly, and only intended of that new Heaven and new Earth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dwelleth the righteous; but upon deeper conſideration I found it, in a great meaſure, true alſo of the former; for, 1. It is moſt certain, that no proud man is truly loved by any but himſelf, but, ſo far as relates to his pride, every man hates him: One proud man perfectly hates another, and looks upon him as his enemy; and thoſe very actions of pride that his own ſelf love makes him approve,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:50399:186"/>or at leaſt allow in himſelf, he ſcorns, derides, abhorrs in another: and though an humble man hath a common love to every man, though proud, or otherwiſe vicious, as being one of mankind, yet in relation to his pride he loves him not nor approves. That very Conſideration therefore, that renders a proud man hated or not loved, renders an humble man loved and approved; yea and by the very proud man himſelf, for he looks upon him as no obſtacle or impediment to the attaining of his ends, as one that is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to none, benificent to all, gentle, and one that ſtands not in his way, giving all due reſpect, honour and difference ſuitable to his place and dignity; he wiſheth all the world were ſuch as he, except himſelf, and therefore he reſpects and tenders him; yea and we ſhall by daily experience ſee in the world, that if a proud man injure or oppreſs an humble man, 'tis a thouſand to one he undertakes his patronage, defence, and vindication, and very oftentimes is a means of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and deliverance. 3. But farther, it is a certain and experienced truth, that Virtue and Goodneſs, eſpecially that of Humility, hath a ſecret party and intereſt
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:50399:186"/>love, or at leaſt approve it in another, though they practiſe it not themſelves; for Virtue and Goodneſs and Humility hath a ſecret congruity to the true and genuine frame of the humane nature; and though mens luſts and paſſions in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure obſcure the conſonancy to it, they can never extinguiſh it, but the mind and conſcience will give a ſecret ſuffrage, wherever it finds it. 4. It is a thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that though the generality of mankind abound with pride, intemperance, injuſtice, and almoſt all kind of vicious diſpoſitions, yea though the beſt of men are not without the irruptions of ſome of thoſe diſtempers, and though it muſt needs be, that where there is the greateſt number there is the greateſt external force either to make ſuch laws as they pleaſe, or to make ſuch Governors as may be ſuitable to their diſpoſition; yet it is rare and a very prodigy to find any Nation to make Laws in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of pride, ambition, intemperance, luxury, oppreſſion, violence, injuſtice, &amp;c. or to chooſe ſuch Magiſtrates or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours (where it is in their choice) as are apparently inclinable to thoſe Vices; but in their choice they chooſe ſuch, as may rather ſuppreſs thoſe vices, and maintain and encourage ſobriety, humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:50399:187"/>benificence, as things moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to humane ſociety; and in their choice of Governors they rather commit the truſt of themſelves, and their Eſtates, and properties to thoſe hands that they find ſober, temperate, humble, juſt; than thoſe that are looſe, intemperate, proud, ambitious, high-minded, inſolent, which is not only an Indication but even a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that although mens paſſions and luſts may tranſport thouſands into thoſe vices, yet their judgments and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are againſt them: And by this means it comes commonly to paſs, that though an humble or a virtuous man may meet with juſtles and rubs from the proud and inſolent, yet at the long run he comes off with advantage, becauſe he hath the greateſt protection and countenance, not only from the great Sovereign of Heaven and Earth, but alſo of humane Laws and Governors, which next under God is the greateſt protection that can be imagined in this world, which very commonly makes good, even <hi>ad literam,</hi> the ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>The meek ſhall inherit the earth;</hi> and the ſaying of the Wiſe man, Prov. 11.12. <hi>Before honour is humility;</hi> and Prov. 16.19. <hi>Better is it to be of an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit with the lowly, than to divide the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:50399:187"/>ſpoil with the proud;</hi> Prov. 22.4. <hi>By Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and the Fear of the Lord are Riches and Honour and Life.</hi> Theſe and the like Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, as they proceed from the Wiſeſt of meer Men, ſo they were not ſpoken at a venture, but upon ſound delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, judgement and experience, and from the true nature and circumſtances of things.</p>
            <p>And now the due conſideration and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of what hath been ſaid, as it affords excellent and effectual Motives to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of this virtue of Humility, ſo they contain excellent Means to attain it; becauſe they may put men upon due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and deſcending unto themſelves; the want of which is the only or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal cauſe of Pride; for ſo much of Pride as any man hath, ſo much of Folly, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertence and Inconſiderateneſs he hath; and true Humility on the other ſide, is a kind of neceſſary reſult of wiſe and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and attentive Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Yet ſome things I ſhall add as <hi>Means</hi> naturally and immediately conducing to the ingenerating and improving this virtue in the mind of men:
1. Conſider <hi>whatſoever good thou haſt,</hi> which may occaſion Elation of mind, <hi>is but what thou hast received</hi> from the free
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:50399:188"/>bounty and goodneſs of thy Maker: What haſt thou which thou haſt not received?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider that the good thou haſt ſo received thou haſt <hi>not received as an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Proprietor, but only as a Steward</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to thy Lord's uſe; and the more thou haſt of any ſuch good, the greater is the aceouat; whether it be of Wit, of Wiſdom, of Learning, of Honour, of Power, of Wealth. If thou art a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, a Treaſurer, a Bayliff, a Steward of another man, and perchance upon that account haſt a great Treaſure of Wealth or Money in thy hands, thou haſt indeed great occaſion of Care, and Vigilance, and Fidelity, and Circumſpection, to husband well and faithfully, to keep thy accounts fair and even; but no cauſe to make thee proud: it is indeed thy burden, rather than benefit or advantage: to whom much is given, of him ſhall much be required. Be humble therefore, thou wilt perform thy truſt the better; for thou art but an Accountant, a Steward, and depoſitory of what thou haſt received.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider <hi>what it is thou pridest thy ſelſ in,</hi> and <hi>Examine well the nature of the things</hi> themſelves, how little and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable they are, or at leaſt how uncertain and unſtable they are, every age, every
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:50399:188"/>complexion, every condition and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of life commonly afford to inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſouls ſome little temptation to pride and vanity, which yet if men did well weigh and conſider, they would appear to be but little bubbles, that would quickly break and vaniſh. Thou haſt fine gay <hi>Cloaths,</hi> and this makes children and young men and women proud even to admiration: But thou art not half ſo fine and gay as the Peacock, Oſtridge, or Parrot: nor is thy bravery ſo much thine own, as theirs is; but it is borrowed from the Silk-worm, the golden Mynes, the induſtry of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broiderer, Weaver, Taylor; and it is no part of thy ſelf: And haſt thou the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſuffer thy ſelf to be abuſed into this childiſh pitiful fooliſh pride? Thou haſt it may be <hi>wealth,</hi> ſtore of Money, but how much of it is of uſe to thee? that which thou ſpendeſt is gone; that which thou haſt is as inſignificant as ſo much dirt or clay, only thy care about it makes thy life the more uneaſie: Beſides, the more thou haſt, the more thou art the mark of other mens rapines, envy, and ſpoil. 'Tis a thouſand to one thou carrieſt not thy Wealth to thy Grave, or if thou doſt, thou canſt not carry it farther, but leave it, it
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:50399:189"/>art thou proud of that which is of no great uſe to thee while thou haſt it; and commonly the faſter thou thinkeſt to hold it the ſooner it is loſt, like him that gripes <hi>Calice</hi> Sand in his fiſt: Thou haſt <hi>Honour, Esteem;</hi> thou art deceived, thou haſt it not, he hath it that gives it thee, and which he may detain from thee at pleaſure. The reſpect, and honour, and eſteem thou haſt, depends upon the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him that gives it.</p>
            <p>Again, how brittle and feeble a thing is Honour, Eſteem, and Reputation? a falſe calumny well and confidently broached is able many times to give it an irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhock: The diſpleaſure of the Prince, or a greater man than thy ſelf, makes thy Sun ſet in a cloud; and a popular jealouſie, imputation, or miſrepreſentation in a moment daſheth the Applauſe, Glory, Honour and Eſteem that a man hath been building up twenty or thirty years: And how vain a thing it is to be proud of the breath either of a Prince or people, which as theirs to recall every moment? But ſuppoſe it were as fixt and ſtable a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and honour as a rock of Marble or Adamant, and that it were the beſt kind of honour imaginable, namely, the reſult of thy virtue and merit, yet ſtill it is but
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:50399:189"/>a ſhadow, a reſlexion of that virtue or worth, which if thou art prond of, thou em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſeſt and degradeſt into vanity and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: And canſt thou think it reaſonable to be proud of the ſhadow, where thou oughteſt not to be proud of that worth that cauſeth it?</p>
            <p>Again, thou haſt <hi>Power,</hi> art <hi>in great place and Authority;</hi> But thou art miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in this, the Power thou haſt is not inherent in thy ſelf: one of the meaneſt of thoſe, whom it may be thou oppreſſeſt, is inherently as powerful as thee, and could it may be over-match thee in Strength, Wit or Policy: but the Power thou haſt is (next under the diſpenſation of the Divine Providence) from thoſe men, that either by their Promiſes, Faith, or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Aſſiſtance have inveſted thee with this Power: This power is nothing inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in thee; but it depends upon the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity or Aſſiſtance of others, which if they either by Perfidiouſneſs to thee, or Reſiſtance againſt thee, or withdrawing their Aſſiſtance to thee, ſhall call again home to themſelves, thou art like <hi>Samſon</hi> having loſt his locks, <hi>Judg. 16. 17.</hi> thy ſtrength will go from thee, and thou wilt become weak, and be like another man. And how have the Hiſtories of all Ages,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:50399:190"/>and our own experience, ſhewn us by very frequent examples, men unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and upon many moments and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies ſeemingly moſt ſmall and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, been tumbled in a moment from the moſt eminent and high degree of Power, into a moſt deſpiſed and deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition? Power hath very often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, like <hi>Jonas</hi> his Gourd, been externally fair and flouriſhing, when at the ſame time there lyes a Worm at the root of it unſeen, but in a moment gnaws aſunder the roots and [heart] of it, and it wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and for the moſt part, the more extenſive and immenſive Humane Power grows, the ſooner it falls to pieces, not only by the Divine Providence checking and rejecting, but by a kind of natural reſult from its own exorbitance and exceſs: for the greater it is, the more difficult it is to manage; it grows top-heavy, and the <hi>Baſis</hi> grows too narrow and weak for its own burden. Beſides it is the common mark of Envy and Diſcontent, which watcheth ſedulouſly all occaſions to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe it, and oftentimes prevails. When power proves too grievous and over bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom, it loſeth the end for which it was conferred, and makes people deſperate and impatient. <hi>Entia nolunt malè gubernari.</hi> If
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:50399:190"/>it be managed with Prudence and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it is the greateſt Benefit to Humane ſociety: But it is the burden of him that hath it, if it be managed tyrannically and exorbitantly; if fills the Maſter full of fears, the People full of rage, and ſeldom proves long-lived. And what reaſon haſt thou to be proud of what is moſt certainly thy burden, or thy damage, or both?</p>
            <p>Again thou haſt <hi>Strength,</hi> or <hi>Beauty,</hi> or <hi>Agility of Body.</hi> Indeed this thou haſt more reaſon to call thy own, than any of the former: but yet thou haſt no cauſe to pride thy ſelf in it; thou canſt not hold it long at beſt, for age will decay that Strength and wither that Beauty, and death will certainly put a period to it; but yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably this Strength or Beauty is not ſo long-lived as thy ſelf, no nor as thy youth; a diſeaſe, it may be, is this very moment growing upon thee, that will ſuddenly pull down thy Strength, and raſe this Beauty, and turn them both into rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs and loathſomneſs. Nay let any obſerve it that will, that ſtrength and beauty that raiſeth pride in the heart, is of all other ſhorteſt-lived, even upon the very account of that very pride: For the often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and vain-glory of Strength puts it forth into deſperate and dangerous under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:50399:191"/>to the ruine of the owner; and pride of Beauty renders the owner thereof fond of the praiſe of it, and ſo expoſe it to the view of others, whereby it becomes a temptation to luſt and intemperance both to the owner of it and others, and in a little while becomes at once its own ruine and ſhame. But it may be thou haſt <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> a quick and ready Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and haſt improved them by great Study and Obſervation in great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Learning:</hi> This I confeſs is much more thy own, than any of the former Endowments; but moſt certainly if thou art proud of any of theſe, thou art not yet arrived to the higheſt improvement of Underſtanding, namely, Wiſdom. Folly and Madneſs may be conſiſtent with a witty, nay a learned man, but not with a truly Wiſe man: and this thy pride of theſe endowments or acqueſts ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth and proclaimeth thee a fool, for all thy wit and all thy learning. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with thy ſelf thy Wit and Learning are but pitiful narrow things, in reſpect of the amplitude of the things that are to be known: <hi>Maxima pars corum qua ſcimus, est minima pars corum qua neſcimus.</hi> Take the moſt Learned Obſervant Philoſopher that ever was in the world, he never yet
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:50399:191"/>was fully acquainted with the nature of thoſe things that are obvious to ordinary obſervation and near to him; never was the perſon yet in the world, that could give an accurate account of the nature of a Fly, or a Worm in its full comprehenſion, no nor of a ſpire of graſs; much leſs of himſelf, and of his nobler Faculties; much leſs yet of thoſe glorious bodies that every day and night object themſelves to our view. What a deal of Uncertainty in Evidence, and Contradiction, do we find in the determination of the choiceſt wits and men of greateſt learning, even in things that are obvious and objected in their own ſight, to all their ſenſes? So that the greateſt Knowledge that men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to in the things of Nature, is little elſe but a ſpecious piece of Ignorance, dreſſed up with fine words, formal me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, precarious ſuppoſitions, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent confidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider how brittle and unſtable thing thy Wit, thy Parts, thy Learning is. Though Old Age may retain ſome broken monuments of thy wit and learning thou once hadſt, yet the floridneſs and vigour of it muſt then decay and gradually wither, till very Old Age make thee a Child again, if thou live to it: But beſides
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:50399:192"/>that a Feaver, or a Palſie, or an Apoplexy may greatly impair, if not wholly deface and obliterate thy Learning, deprive thee of thy Memory, of thy Wit and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: Never be proud of ſuch a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge or endowment, which is under the mercy of a diſeaſe, nay of a diſtemper in thy blood, an aduſt humor, a Hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal vapour, a caſual fume of a Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or a fall, whether thou ſhalt hold it or loſe it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But yet farther, mark it while thou wilt, and thou wilt then ſooner perceive it in another than in thy ſelf, Wit and Learning in any man never in any caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives more foils, more diſadvantage, more blemiſh, more impair more than by Pride: He that is proud of his own knowledge is commonly at his <hi>non ultra,</hi> and rarely acquires more, ſcorns inſtruction, and ſtops the farther advance of his faculties, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or learning, and undervalues, and therefore neglects, what he might learn from others. Again, Pride caſts an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemlineſs, Undecency, and many times even a Ridiculouſneſs upon the greateſt Parts and Learning: it is like the dead Fly in the Apothecary's Confection, that makes the whole unſavoury: How common and rife is this unhappy cenſure, that attends
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:50399:192"/>the commendation of ſuch a man's wit and learning; indeed he is a pretty man, a good Scholar, of fine parts, good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but he knows it too well; his proud ſelf-conceitedneſs, vain-glory, ſpoils it all, and renders the man under the juſt repute of a fool, and ridiculous, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his Clerkſhip and Learning. But yet farther, Pride, by a kind of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and natural conſequence, very often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times robs men, even of their Wit and Learning, wherein they pride themſelves, by carrying up into the brain thoſe exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, hot, cholerick humors, and fumes that break the ſtaple and right temper and texture of the brain. More learned men grow mad and brain-ſick with the pride of that learning they think they have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, than in the purſuit and acqueſt of it. Therefore beware of Pride of thy Wit, Learning, or Knowledge, if thou intend to keep it, or to keep thy juſt eſteem or reputation of it. On the other ſide Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Lowlineſs of mind is the beſt temper to improve thy faculties, to add a grace to thy Learning, and to keep thee Maſter of it: it cools and qualifies thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and blood, and humors, and renders thee fit to retain what thou haſt attained, and to acquire more.</p>
            <pb n="362" facs="tcp:50399:193"/>
            <p n="4">4. In all thy reflexion upon thy ſelf and what thou haſt, <hi>never Compare thy ſelf with thoſe that are below thee in what is worthy or eminent, but with thoſe that are above thy ſelf.</hi> For inſtance in point of Learning or Knowledge, thy partiality and indulgence to thy ſelf will be apt to put thee upon comparing thy ſelf with thoſe, that are ignorant or not more learned than thy ſelf, as we ſee ordinarily idiots, or fools, or men of weak intellectuals, delight to converſe with thoſe they find or think more fooliſh than themſelves, with a thought that they are the wiſeſt in the company: but compare thy ſelf with thoſe that are more learned or wiſe than thy ſelf, and thou wilt ſee matter to keep thee humble. If thou thinkeſt thou art a pretty proficient in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, compare thy ſelf with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> with <hi>Plato,</hi> with <hi>Themiſtius,</hi> or <hi>Alexander Aphrodiſaeus,</hi> or other great Luminaries in Philoſophy; if thou thinkeſt thou art a pretty proficient in School-Learning, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy ſelf with <hi>Aquinas, Scotus, Suarez;</hi> if thou think thou excelleſt in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, compare thy ſelf with <hi>Euclide, Archimedes, Tycho,</hi> &amp;c. and then thou wilt find thy ſelf to be like a little Candle to a Star. The moſt of the Learning that this Age glories of, is but an Extract or
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:50399:193"/>Collection of what we find in thoſe men of greater parts; only we think we have done great matters if we digeſt it into ſome other method, and prick in here and there a ſmall pittance of our own, or quarrel at ſomething that the Ancients delivered in ſome odd particulars.</p>
            <p>And yet even in this very eſſay Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love playes ſuch a part, that unleſs there be a great exceſs and admirable advantage of others that are above as in any learning or knowledge, we are ready to exalt our ſelves above our ſtandard, and ſeem in our own eyes to be at leaſt equal to thoſe that exceed us, or by envy and detraction to bring down others below our ſelves, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we hit upon ſome little caprichio that we think they ſaid not.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, conſider the great <hi>Example of our Lord</hi> and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus, who was the only Son of the glorious God, full of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Knowledge, Power, Holineſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth, and notwithſtanding all this, humbled himſelf and became of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, emptied himſelf, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and became obedient to death, even the death of the Croſs; <hi>Philipp.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7, 8. Chriſt Jeſus brought with him from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Doctrine of Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:50399:194"/>neſs, and in all his Sermons there is not any one Virtue that he commendeth and commandeth more than Humility and Lowlineſs of Mind, nor any one Vice that he ſets himſelf more againſt than Pride and Haughtineſs of Mind. In his Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, <hi>Matth. 5.35.</hi> Poverty of Spirit hath the firſt promiſe, and Meekneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility the third. <hi>Matth. 23.6, 7.</hi> He checks and diſparageth the Pride of the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> commands his Diſciples to run quite counter to their method; <hi>He that will be great among you, ſhall be your ſervant.</hi> Again, <hi>Matth. 18.1. Luk.9. Mar.9.</hi> 34. when the bubble of Ambition aroſe among the Diſciples, who ſhould be greateſt, he checks their Pride with the pattern and commendation of a little Child: And what he thus taught, he lived. One of the great Ends of the miſſion of Chriſt into the world, was that he ſhould not only be a Preacher of Virtue, Goodneſs; and Piety, but alſo an Example of it: And if we look through the whole life of Chriſt, there is not one virtue that he did more ſignally exerciſe, or by his example more expreſly commend to the imitation of Chriſtians, than Humility. I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he ſaith in any place Learn of me to do Miracles, for I am mighty in
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:50399:194"/>power; no nor yet Learn of me, for I am Holy, for I am Obedient to the Law of God, for I am Liberal, though in all theſe he was exhibited as an excellent Example of Holineſs, Obedience, and Charity, and muſt be the pattern of our imitation: But as if Humility and Lowlineſs of Mind were the great Maſter-piece of his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he calls out, even when he was in one of the higheſt Extaſies of ſpirit, that we find until his Paſſion, <hi>Matth. 11. 25, 29. Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall find reſt unto your ſouls:</hi> And in that ſignal advice given by the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.5. Let the ſame mind be in you which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus, who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God: But made himſelf of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſs of man; and being found in the faſhion of a man, he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf, and became obedient to death, even the death of the croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Bleſſed Saviour! was there nothing elſe for us to learn of thee, but thy Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Humility? was there not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe wherein we were to bear in Mind, thy Image, and write after thy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Copy? was there not thy Holineſs, Purity, Obedience, Patience, Truſt in
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:50399:195"/>God, and all that Conſtellation of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that appeared in thy Doctrine and Life?</p>
            <p>Surely yes, he was exhibited both as a Prophet to Teach, and an Example to be Imitated in all theſe alſo, but in his Humility, if we may ſay with reverence, before all:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the inſtance and example of his Humility was the moſt ſignal and wonderful of all the reſt of his admirable virtues; that the Eternal Son of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God ſhould condeſcend ſo low, as to become a man, born of a woman, and live upon earth ſuch a deſpiſed life, and dye ſuch an accurſed death, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Humility, not only beyond all example, but an inſtance is impoſſible in nature to be parallel'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe Pride and Vain-glory is ſo unhappily rivetted in the corrupt nature of man, and it is ſo hard a thing to bring him to be humble and lowly, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the benefits and advantages of it, that it did not only ſtand in need of the moſt explicit Doctrine of Chriſt to teach and commend it, the moſt unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd Example of Chriſt to win men over to it, but alſo the moſt plain and direct and explicit explication of that Example
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:50399:195"/>by that remarkable and ſpecial invitation of our Lord to it, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly;</hi> and again by his Apoſtle, <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you which was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe without Humility to prepare and mellow the hearts of men, it would not be morally poſſible for them to receive the Faith of Chriſt. It was Pride that made the Doctrine of Chriſt only to be to the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſtumbling-block, to the <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſhneſs, but to them that are called, <hi>viz.</hi> that obey the call of Chriſt, <hi>Matth. 11.28. Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Learn of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for I am meek and lowly in heart;</hi> it is Chriſt the Power of God and the Wiſdom of God. 1 <hi>Cor. 1.23, 24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe, without Humility, all the reſt of thoſe Excellent Virtues, that were taught in the Doctrine, and exhibited in the Example of Chriſt, had been but unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable: A viſible Holineſs, yet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Pride and Oſtentation, is but a diſguiſe of holineſs, that accurſed hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, that our Saviour condemned in the Phariſees and others, <hi>Matth. 6.16.</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of God, Good works, Faſting, Prayers, yet if done with Pride, Oſtentation, and Vain-glory, are dead and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:50399:196"/>unacceptable. <hi>Matth. 23.5.</hi> Charity, Alms, and Benificence, if done with Pride, and Oſtentation, and to receive Glory of men, loſeth its worth and reward. <hi>Matth.6.12.</hi> So that Humility and Lowlineſs of Mind is the <hi>ſubſtratum</hi> and ground-work, the neceſſary ingredient into all acceptable duties towards God or Men.</p>

            <head>A GOOD METHOD TO ENTERTAIN Unſtable and Troubleſome TIMES.</head>
            <p>THe firſt expedient is to <hi>Expect them before they come;</hi> the very ſtate of the World is Uncertain and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and for the moſt part Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Troubleſome. If there be ſome intervals of Tranquillity and Sedateneſs, they are commonly attended with longer periods of unquietneſs and trouble; and the greateſt impreſſions are then made by them, when they ſurprize us, and come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected. When the mind is prepared for them by a kind of Anticipation, it abates the edge, and keenneſs, and ſharpneſs of them. By this means a man, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, knows the worſt of them before he feels them, which renders the very incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50399:197"/>of them not ſo ſmart and troubleſome to ſenſe, as otherwiſe they would be. This Pre-apprehenſion and Anticipation of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and difficulties is the mother of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, where it is poſſible; and where it is not, yet it is the mother of Patience and Reſolution when they come. <hi>Bilney</hi> the Martyr, was wont before he ſuffered, to put his Finger in the Candle, to habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate himſelf to a patient undergoing of his future Martyrdom; by this means, he in a great meaſure knew the worſt of it, and armed himſelf with reſolution and patience to bear i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Men are too apt to feed their fancies with the Anticipation of what they hope for and wiſh in this World, and to poſſeſs it in imagination, before they attain it in fruition; and this makes men vain: and if they would have the patience ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to anticipate what they have juſt cauſe to fear, and to put themſelves under a Pre-apprehenſion of it, in relation to croſſes and troubles; it would make them wiſe, and teach them a leſſon of Patience and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, before they have occaſion to uſe it; ſo that they need not then begin to learn it when the preſent and incumbent Preſſure renders the leſſon more difficult. This was the Method our Bleſſed Lord took with his Diſciples, frequently to tell them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50399:197"/>before-hand what they muſt expect in the world, <hi>Math. 10.</hi> and in divers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, telling them, they muſt expect in this world the worſt of temporal evils, that they might thereby be prepared to entertain them with Reſolution and Patience, and might habituate their minds for their recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond expedient is, that we uſe all diligence to <hi>gain ſuch a Treaſure as lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> the reach of the Storms of this world; a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken; namely, our Peace with God in Chriſt, the Pardon of our Sins, and a well-grounded Hope, and aſſurance of Eternal Life. Theſe be things that lie out of Gun-ſhot, and will render the greateſt troubles that can befall this lower world, or us in it; not only tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, but ſmall and inconſiderable, when in the midſt of all the concuſſions of this world, in the midſt of Loſſes of Goods or Eſtate, in the midſt of Storms, and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Diſaſters, and Calamities, a man can have ſuch deep and ſettled conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe: <hi>Though I can ſee nothing but Confuſions, and little hopes of their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet I have that which is out of the reach of all theſe; that which is infinitely more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable to me, than all the beſt the World can give; that which I can pleaſe and comfort my</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50399:198"/>
               <hi>ſelf in, not with ſtanding all theſe worldly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions and fears; namely, the aſſurance of my Peace with the great God of Heaven and Earth. The worſt that I can ſuffer by theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſures, &amp; the moſt I can fear from them, is but death; and that will not only put a period to the things I ſuffer, or can fear in this life, but will let me into the actual poſſeſſion of my hopes, even ſuch a ſtate of glory &amp; happineſs as can never be ended, nor ſhaken.</hi> Such a hope, and ſuch an aſſurance as this, will keep the ſoul above water, and in a ſtate of peace and tranquillity in all the Tempeſts and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks that can befal either this inferiour World, or any perſon in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Expedient is this, that a man <hi>be Reſolvedly conſtant to keep a good Conſcience,</hi> both before the approach of Troubles, and under them. It is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, that the very Sting and Venom of all Croſſes and Troubles, is Sin, and a Conſciouſneſs of the guilt of it. This is that which gives Troubles and Croſſes, and Calamities their vigor, force, and ſharpneſs; it is the Elixir, the very Life of them, when a man ſhall be under extream outward Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, loſs of Goods, loſs of Liberty, loſs of Country, all outward hopes failing, and ſtill greater Billows, and Waves, and Storms, and Fears, in proſpect, and within an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50399:198"/>unquiet, avenging Conſcience, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed troubles have their perfection of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity. But if a man, in the midſt of all theſe black and ſtormy appearances, hath a Conſcience full of Peace, and Integrity, and comfortable Atteſtation, this gives a Calm in the midſt of all theſe Storms; and the reaſon is apparent: for it is not the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuouſneſs or Tranquillity of Externals, that creates the trouble or the quietneſs of the Man, but it is the Mind, and that ſtate of compoſure or diſcompoſure that the mind is put into occaſionally from them; and ſince there is nothing in the world that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth more to the compoſure &amp; tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the mind, than the Serenity and Clearneſs of the Conſcience; keep but that ſafe and untainted, the mind will enjoy a calm and tranquillity in the midſt of all the ſtorms of the World; and although the Waves beat, and the Sea works, and the Winds blow, that mind that hath a quiet and clear Conſcience within, will be as ſtable and as ſafe from perturbation, as a Rock in the midſt of a Tempeſtuous Sea, and will be a <hi>Goſhen</hi> to, and within it ſelf, when the reſt of the world without, and round about a man, is like an <hi>Egypt</hi> for Plagues and Darkneſs. If therefore, either before the acceſs or irruption of troubles,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50399:199"/>or under their preſſure, any thing or perſon in the world ſollicite thee to eaſe or deliver thy ſelf by a breach or wound of thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, know, they are about to cheat thee of thy beſt ſecurity under God, againſt the power and malignity of troubles; they are about to clip off that Lock, wherein next under God, thy ſtrength lieth. What-ever therefore thou doſt hazard or loſe, keep the integrity of thy Conſcience, both before the acceſs of troubles and under them. It is a Jewel, that will make thee Rich in the midſt of Poverty; a Sun, that will give thee Light in (the) midſt of darkneſs; a Fortreſs that will keep thee ſafe in the greateſt danger, and that is never to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, unleſs thou thy ſelf betray it, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it up.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next Expedient is this; namely, an <hi>Aſſurance that the Divine Wiſdom, Power, and Providence, doth Diſpoſe, Govern, and Order all</hi> the things in the world, even thoſe that ſeem moſt confuſed, irregular, tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and contumacious. This, as it is a moſt certain truth, ſo is it a moſt excellent expedient to compoſe and fettle the mind, eſpecially of ſuch a man who truly loves and fears this great God, even under the blackeſt and moſt diſmal Troubles and Confuſions, for it muſt moſt neceſſarily
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50399:199"/>give a ſound, preſent, and practical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Patience and Contentation. For even theſe black diſpenſations are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government and management of the moſt Wiſe and Powerful God. Why ſhould I, that am a fooliſh vain Creature, that ſcarce ſee to any diſtance before me, take upon me to cenſure theſe Diſpenſations, to ſtruggle impatiently with them, to diſquiet and torment my ſelf with vexation at them? Let God alone to govern and order the world as he thinks fit: as his Power is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and cannot be reſiſted, ſo is his Wiſdom infinite, and knows beſt what is to be done, and when, and how. 2. As it gives a ſound Argument of Patience and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ſo it gives a clear inference of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of our ſelves up unto him, and to his will and diſpoſal, upon the account of his Goodneſs. It is the mere Bounty and Goodneſs of God that firſt gave being to all things, and preſerves all things in their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that gives all thoſe Accomodations and Conveniencies that accompanie their Being; why ſhould I therefore diſtruſt his Goodneſs? As he hath Power to do what he pleaſeth; Wiſdom to direct and diſpoſe that Power, ſo he hath infinite Goodneſs, that accompanies that Power and that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. As I cannot put my will into the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50399:200"/>hands of greater Wiſdom, ſo I cannot put my will into the hands of greater Goodneſs: His Beneficence to his Creatures is greater than it is poſſible for the Creatures to have to themſelves. I will not only therefore patiently Submit to his Power and Will, which I can by no means reſiſt, but chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Reſign up my ſelf to the diſpoſal of his Will, which is infinitely beſt, and therefore a better rule for my diſpoſal, than my own will.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The next Expedient is <hi>Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbence upon thoſe Promiſes</hi> of his, which all wiſe and good men do, and muſt value above the beſt Inheritance in this World: namely, that he will not leave nor forſake thoſe that fear and love him. <hi>Heb. 13.5. How much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give good things to them that ask him,</hi> Matth. 6.30 Matth. 7.11. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> Rom. 8. 32. <hi>All things ſhall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for good to them that love God,</hi> Rom 8. 28 Upon the aſſurance of theſe Divine Promiſes, my heart may quiet it ſelf in the midſt of all the moſt dark and tumultuous concuſſions in the world. Is it beſt for me to be delivered out of them, or to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in or under them? I am under the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50399:200"/>Providence and Government of my Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, who hath ſaid, He will not leave me, nor forſake me; who takes more care of me, and bears more love to me than I can bear to my moſt dutiful Child; that can in a moment reſcue (me) from the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or infallibly ſecure me under it; that ſees and knows every moment of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and a thouſand expedients to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve or relieve me. On the other ſide, do I fall in the ſame common calamity, and ſink under it without any deliverance from it, or preſervation under it? His will be done; I am ſure it is for my good, nay, it is not poſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe. For my very death, the worſt of worldly evils will be but the tranſmiſſion of me into a ſtate of Bleſſedneſs, Reſt, and Immortality; for, <hi>Bleſſed are they that die in the Lord, they reſt from their labours and (their) works follow them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. The next Expedient is <hi>Prayer.</hi> The glorious God of Heaven hath given us a free and open acceſs to his Throne, there to ſue out by Prayer, thoſe Bleſſings and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which he hath promiſed. It is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Duty that we owe in recognition of the divine Soveraignty; a Priviledge of greater value than if we were made Lords
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50399:201"/>of the whole Earth; but a Means to attain thoſe Mercies, that the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs knows to be fitteſt for us; by this means we may be ſure to have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or preſervation, if uſeful or fit for us; or if not, yet thoſe favours and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Almighty God, that are better than deliverance it ſelf; namely, Patience and Contentedneſs with the Divine Good Pleaſure; Reſignation of our wills to him; great Peace and Tranquillity of mind; Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and Communications of his Love and Favour to us; Support under our weakneſſes and deſpondences: and many times Almighty God, in theſe Wilderneſſes of diſtractions and confuſions, and ſtorms, and calamities, whether publick or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, gives out as a return to hearty and faithful prayer, ſuch Revelations of his Goodneſs, and Irradiations of his Favour and Love, that a man would not exchange for all the external happineſs that this world can afford; and Recompenceth the loſs and troubles in relation to externals, with a far greater meaſure of the Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his favour, than ever a man did receive in his greateſt confluence of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal advantages. Yea, and poſſibly, the time of external ſtorms and troubles is far
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50399:201"/>more ſeaſonable for ſuch returns of faithful and humble prayer, than the times of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affluence and benefits: and the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoul by ſuch troubles raiſed to a greater height, and accompanied with more Grace and Humility and Fervency, than is ordinarily found in a condition of external peace, plenty and ſerenity.</p>

            <head>OF THE REDEMPTION OF TIME How, and why it is to be REDEEMED.</head>
            <p>I Would conſider theſe <hi>Particulars:</hi> 1. What that Time is which we are to Redeem. 2. What it is to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem that Time. 3. How that Time is to be Redeemed. 4. Why that Time is thus to be Redeemed.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe, what that <hi>Time</hi> is, that is to be Redeemed. The Philoſophers trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves much what time is, and leave it very difficult; but we ſhall not need to trouble our ſelves with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. The Time that is here meant, ſeems to be under this double Relation: Firſt, in relation to ſome apt ſeaſon for any thing to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50399:204"/>be done; and then it is properly called Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; which is nothing elſe but the co-incidence of ſome circumſtance accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to ſome action ſuitable to it: as the Time for the Husband-man to Reap his Corn, is when the Corn is ripe, and the weather ſeaſonable. It is time for the Smith to forge his Iron when it is hot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore malleable; and ſo in matters moral: It is a time to ſhew mercy when an object of miſery occurrs, and a power to give relief. This, as I take it, is that which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Opportunity. Secondly, In relation to that continuance of the duration of the reaſonable Creature in life, in this world, or the time of our life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To Redeem</hi> Time therefore, is in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. In relation to Seaſons or Opportunities: the Redemption of Time in this reſpect is 1. Diligently to watch and obſerve all fitting Seaſons and Opportunities of doing all the good we may, whether in relation to Almighty God, his Service and Glory; in relation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in all acts of Charity and Juſtice; in relation to our ſelves, in improvements of Knowledge, Piety and Vertue. 2. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly to lay hold of all theſe opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and not to let them ſlip, but to apply ſuitable actions to ſuitable opportunities,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50399:204"/>when they occurr. 2. In relation to the times of our lives; and ſo we are ſaid to Redeem our Time. 1. When we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly imploy our time, and leave as few vacuities and <hi>interſtitia</hi> in it without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying it; the oppoſite to this is Idleneſs, or doing nothing. 2. When we imploy our time conſtantly in doing ſomething that is anſwerable to the value and uſefulneſs of our time. 3. The oppoſites to this, are firſt, the ſinful imployment of our time, which is indeed worſe than Idleneſs: Or Secondly, the vain, and impertinent, and unprofitable imployment of our time, as <hi>Domitian</hi> did in killing of Flyes. When we imploy our time not only in things profitable, but in ſuch things as are of greateſt uſe and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and therefore ſuch imployments as are of greateſt importance and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought to take up the greateſt and moſt conſiderable part of our time; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we are imprudent and irrational in the Improvement or Redemption of our Time. And therefore this Redeeming of our Time is ordinarily called Husbanding of our time, in reſemblance of the Husband-mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with his ground. If the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth not at all Till and Sow his ground, but is idle; or if he takes much pains in Tilling of his ground, and Sowes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

But of this more in the next.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>How</hi> Time is to be Redeemed. The particular Methods of Husbanding of Time under both the former relations, <hi>viz.</hi> in relation to opportunity, and in relation to our time of life, ſhall be promiſcuouſly ſet down. Now <hi>the actions of our lives</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed into ſeveral kinds, and in relation to thoſe ſeveral actions, will the imployments of our times be diverſified. 1. There are actions <hi>Natural,</hi> ſuch as are Eating, Drinking, Sleep, Motion, Reſt. 2. Actions <hi>Civil;</hi> as Proviſion for Families, bearing of publick Offices in times of Peace or War; moderate Recreations and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements; imployments in civil Vocations,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50399:205"/>as Agriculture, Mechanical Trades, Liberal Profeſſions. 3. Actions <hi>Moral,</hi> whether relating to our ſelves, as Sobriety, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Moderation, (which though they are rather habits than action, and the actions of them rather conſiſts in Negatives than Poſitives, yet I ſtile them actions) or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to others, as acts of Juſtice, Charity, Compaſſion, Liberality. 4. Or laſt, Actions <hi>Religious,</hi> relating to Almighty God, as Invocation, Thankſgiving, Inquiringinto his Works, Will, Obedience to his Law and Commands, obſerving the ſolemn ſeaſons of his Worſhip and Service, and, which muſt go through and give a tincture to all the reſt, a habit of Fear of him, Love to him, Humility and Integrity of heart and ſoul before him; and in ſum, a habit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion towards God in his Son Jeſus Chriſt; which is the <hi>magnum oportet,</hi> the one thing neceſſary, and over-weighs all the reſt upon this account. 1. In reſpect of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and ſoveraignty of the Object, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, to whom we owe our Being, and the ſtrength and flower of our Souls. 2. In reſpect of the nobleneſs of the end thereby and therein to be attained; for whereas all the reſt ſerve only to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of this Life, the latter hath a proſpect to an eternal Life. 3. In reſpect of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50399:206"/>nobleneſs of the habit it ſelf, which hath an univerſal influence into all the reſt of the before-mentioned relations, and advanceth and improveth, and innobleth them. It would be too long to proſecute the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Redeeming the Time in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular relations to all theſe actions in this ſheet of paper; therefore in this purſuit of the manner of Redeeming the Time, I ſhall ſet down only theſe <hi>generals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to <hi>neglect no opportunity</hi> that occurs to do good; but 1. To <hi>watch all</hi> opportunities, that offer themſelves in order thereunto. 2. To <hi>ſeek for them,</hi> if they offer not themſelves. 3. To <hi>uſe them,</hi> and not to let them ſlip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the co-incidence of opportunities of ſeveral kinds, and ſuiting to ſeveral actions, to give thoſe the <hi>praelation</hi> that correſpond to the moſt worthy actions; and in the co-incidence of opportunities for actions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual moment to prefer ſuch as are moſt rare, and probably of unlikelihood to occur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, before thoſe that are under a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of frequent occurrence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are to be very careful to <hi>leave no banks</hi> or interſperſions of idleneſs in our lives. Thoſe men that have moſt imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of the moſt conſtant nature, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but have certain <hi>interstitia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50399:206"/>tween the varieties of buſineſs, which may be fitted with imployments ſuitable to their length or qualities; and it becomes a good Husband of his time to have ſome deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deſtinations of buſineſſes that may be ſuitable to the nature, quality, ſeaſons, and <hi>morae</hi> of thoſe vacant <hi>interſtitia.</hi> An induſtrious Husband-man, Trades-man, Scholar, will never want buſineſs fitted for occaſional vacancies and <hi>horae ſubſecivae. Gellius,</hi> his <hi>Noctes Atticae</hi> have left us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of it: And a Chriſtian, even as ſuch, hath ready imployments for occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal interſtices, Reading, Praying; the crums and fragments of time would be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with their ſuitable imployments; 'tis precious, and therefore let none of it be loſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Much time might be ſave dand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed in <hi>retrenching the unneceſſary expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> thereof in our ordinary ſleep, attiring and dreſſing our ſelves, and the length of our Meals, as Breakfaſts, Dinners, Suppers; which, eſpecially in this latter Age, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong people of the better ſort, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to an immoderate and exceſſive length: There is little leſs than ten or twelve hours every day ſpent in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and their appendancies which might be fairly reduced to much leſs.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:50399:207"/>
            <p n="5">5. Take heed of entertaining <hi>vain thoughts,</hi> which are a very great conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time, and is very incident to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and Fanciful perſons, whom I have known to ſit the greateſt part of ſeveral days in projecting what they would do if they had ſuch Eſtates, Honours, or Places, and ſuch kind of unprofitable and vain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations; which humour is much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in them that lie long in bed in a Morning.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Beware of too much <hi>Recreation.</hi> Some bodily exerciſe is neceſſary, for ſedentary men eſpecially; but let it not be too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, nor too long. Gameing, Taverns, and Plays, as they are pernicious, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Youth; ſo if they had no other fault, yet they are juſtly to be declined in reſpect of their exceſſive expence of time, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituating men to idleneſs and vain thoughts, and diſturbing paſſions and ſymptoms, when they are paſt, as well as while they are uſed. Let no Recreations of any long continuance be uſed in the Morning, for they hazard the loſs or diſcompoſure of the whole day after.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Viſits</hi> made or received, are for the moſt part an intollerable conſumption of time, unleſs prudently ordered; and they are for the moſt part ſpent in vain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50399:207"/>diſcourſes. 1. Let them not be uſed in the Morning. 2. If the viſits be made to, or by perſons of impertinence, let them be ſhort, and at ſuch times as may be beſt ſpared from what is more uſeful or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> at Meals, or preſently after. 3. But if the perſons to be viſited, are men of Wiſdom, Learning, or Eminence of parts, the viſits may be longer, but yet ſo as the time may be proſitably ſpent in uſeful diſcourſe, which carries with it, as well profit and advantage, as civility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Be obſtinately conſtant to your <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> at certain ſet times; and be ſure to ſpend the <hi>Lords day</hi> entirely in thoſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties proper for it; and let nothing but an inevitable neceſſity divert you from it. For, 1. It is the beſt and moſt proſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſpent time; it is in order to the great end of your being in this World. 2. It is in order to your everlaſting happineſs; in compariſon of which, all other buſineſſes of this life are idle and vain; it is that which will give you the greateſt comfort in your Life, in your Sickneſs, in your Death; and he is a Fool that provides not for that which will moſt certainly come. 3. It is the moſt reaſonable tribute imaginable unto that God, that lends you your time, and you are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50399:208"/>bound to pay it under all the obligations of duty and gratitude: And 4. It is that which will ſanctifie and proſper all the reſt of your time, and your ſecular imployments. I am not apt to be ſuperſtitious, but this I have certainly &amp; infallibly found true, that by my deportment in my duty towards God, in the times devoted to his Service, eſpecially on the Lords day, I could make a certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of my ſucceſs in my ſecular occaſions the reſt of the week after: If I were looſe and negligent in the former, the latter ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſucceeded well; if ſtrict, and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and watchful in the former, I was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful and proſperous in the latter.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Be induſtrious and faithful in your <hi>Calling.</hi> The merciful God hath not only indulged unto us a far greater portion of time for our ordinary occaſions, than he hath reſerved to himſelf, but alſo injoyns and requires our induſtry and diligence in it. And remember that you obſerve that induſtry and diligence, not only as a civil means to acquire a competency for your ſelf and your Family, but alſo as an act of obedience to his Command and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; by means whereof, you make it not only an act of civil converſation, but of obedience to Almighty God, and ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in a manner ſpiritualized into an act Religion.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50399:208"/>
            <p n="10">10. Whatever you do, be very careful to retain in your heart a <hi>habit of Religion,</hi> that may be always about you, and keep your heart, and your life always as in his preſence, and tending towards him. This will be continually with you, and put it ſelf into acts, even although you are not in a ſolemn poſture of Religious worſhip, and will lend you multitudes of Religious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to Almighty God, upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and interventions, which will not at all hinder you in any meaſure in your ſecular occaſions, but better and further you; it will make you faithful in your Calling, even upon the account of an actual reflexion of your mind upon the preſence and command of the God you fear and love: It will make you actually thankful for all ſucceſſes and ſupplies; temperate and ſober in all your natural actions; juſt and faithful in all your dealings; patient and contented in all your diſappointments and croſſes; and actually conſider and intend his Honour in all you do; and will give a tincture of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Devotion upon all your ſecular imployments, and turn thoſe very actions, which are materially civil or natural, into the very true and formal nature of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make your whole life to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intermitted life of Religion and Duty to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50399:209"/>God. For this habit of piety in your ſoul, will not only (not) lie ſleeping and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, but almoſt in every hour of the day will put forth actual exertings of it ſelf in applications of ſhort occaſional Prayers, Thankſgivings, Dependance, reſort unto that God that is always near you, and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a manner in your heart by his fear, and love, and habitual Religion towards him. And by this means you do effeually, and in the beſt and readieſt manner imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, doubly Redeem your Time. 1. In the lawful exerciſe of thoſe natural and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil concerns which are not only permitted, but in a great meaſure injoyned by Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God. 2. At the ſame time exerciſing acts of Religious duties, obſervance and Vencration unto Almighty God, by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, or at leaſt frequently reiterated, though ſhort acts of devotion to him. And this is the great act of Chriſtian Chymiſtry, to convert thoſe acts that are materially na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or civil, into acts truly and formally Religious; whereby the whole courſe of this life is both truly and interpretatively a Service to Almighty God, and an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſtate of Religion, which is the beſt, and nobleſt, and moſt univerſal redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Time.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Be very careful to <hi>prefer thoſe actions</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:50399:209"/>of your life <hi>that moſt concern you;</hi> be ſure to do them firſt, to do them chiefeſt, to do them moſt. Let thoſe things, that are of leſs moment, give place to thoſe things that are of greateſt moment. Every man of the moſt ordinary prudence, having many things to do, will be ſure to be doing of that firſt and chiefeſt which moſt concerns him, and which being omitted, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly wholly diſappointed, might occaſion his moſt irreparable loſs. We have, it is true, many things to be done in this life, <hi>Ars longa, vita brevis;</hi> and we have ſeaſons and opportunities for them; but of theſe many things, ſome are barely conveniencies for this life: Some, though they ſeem more neceſſary, yet ſtill they riſe no higher, nor look no ſurther, nor ſerve no longer, but only for the Meridian of this life, and are of no poſſible uſe in the next moment after death. The Pleaſures, the Proſits, the Honours, the moſt florid accommodations of great humane Learning, ſtately Houſes and Palaces, goodly Poſſeſſions, greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, higheſt Reputation, deepeſt Policy, they are fitted only to this life; when death comes, they are inſigniſicant pittiful things, and ſerve nothing at all to the very next moment after death; nay, the diſeaſes and pains, and languiſhings that are the <hi>praelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:50399:210"/>of death, render them perfectly vain, if not vexatious and torturing. But there are certain buſineſſes that are not only excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently uſeful in this life, but ſuch as abide by us in ſickneſs, in death; nay, go along with us with ſingular comfort into the next life, and never leave us, but ſtate us in an eternal ſtate of reſt and happineſs, ſuch as may be with much eaſe acquired in the times of health and life, but very difficult to be attained in the time of Sickneſs, and the hour of death, but never to be gotten after death; ſuch as are of that neceſſity, that in compariſon of them, all other things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and vain, if not deſperately noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hurtful. There is no neceſſity for me to be Rich, and to be great in the World; to have ſuch a title of Honour, ſuch a place of Dignity, or Profit; to leave ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance or titular Dignity to my Son, or to have ſo many thouſand pounds in my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory, when I die; but certain matters of abſolute neceſſity to me, ſuch as if I am without, I am undone and loſt, and yet ſuch as if not attained here in this life, can never be attained: and therefore, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns me in the higheſt degree to attain them; ſo it concerns me in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to attain them in this life, and to take all opportunities imaginable in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50399:210"/>and to redeem every minute of time for that purpoſe, leſt I ſhould be for ever diſappointed, and not to be like the fooliſh Virgin, to be getting of Oyl when the door is ready to be ſhut; and with the Truant-Scholar, to trifle away my time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted me for my leſſon and then to begin to learn it when my Maſter calls for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it; and thoſe buſineſſes are ſuch as theſe: the Knowledg of Chriſt Jeſus, and him Crucified; the attainment of Faith in God through him; the acquaintance of my ſelf with the will God; the comparing of my ſelf with that will; the exerciſe of true and ſerious Repentance for ſins paſt; the ſteady reſolution of Obedience to his will for the time to come; the attaining of the pardon of my ſins, and peace with God through Chriſt our Lord; the ſubduing of my Luſts and Corruptions; the conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my will and life to the holy will of God, and the perfect pattern of Holineſs, Chriſt Jeſus; the working out my ſalvation with fear and trembling; the giving all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make my Calling and Election ſure; the fitting and purging of my ſelf to be a Veſſel of Glory and Immortality, and fitted for the uſe of my great Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; the caſting of my ſelf into ſuch a frame and poſture of mind and life, that I may be fitted and ready to die, and give up my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50399:211"/>to my Lord with peace and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and comfort; ſo that if I ſhould, either by the hand of ſome diſeaſe or caſualty, or other providence, receive this ſolemn meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, <hi>Set thy Houſe in order for thou ſhalt die.</hi> I might receive it with as much readineſs, willingneſs, and chearfulneſs, as a faithful and diligent Servant would receive this command from his Maſter; <hi>You muſt take ſuch a Journey for me to morrow.</hi> Theſe, and ſuch like buſineſſes as theſe, beſides the conſtant tenor of a juſt, virtuous, and piou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> life, are the moſt important buſineſſes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Chriſtian. Firſt, ſuch as are of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to him, he may not, he cannot be without them. Secondly, ſuch as cannot be done elſe-where than in this life; this world is the great Elaboratory for perfecting of ſouls for the next; if they are not done here, they ceaſe to be done for ever; death ſhuts the door, and everlaſtingly ſeals us up in that ſtate it finds us. Thirdly: And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſeaſon of this life is not at leaſt ſo ſuitable for it; ſickneſs, and pain, and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and froward old Age have buſineſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of themſelves to entertain us; and any man that hath had experience of either, will find he hath enough to do (to) bear them, or to ſtruggle with them. And fourthly: We know not whether the grace
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50399:211"/>and opportunities that God hath lent us, and we have neglected in our lives, ſhall ever be afforded again to us in the times of our Sickneſſes, or upon our Death-beds; but a little portion of time in our lives and healths are furniſhed with thouſands of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations and golden opportunities for theſe great works. Let us therefore redeem thoſe portions of time that our life and health lends us, for this great and one thing neceſſary.</p>
            <p>And now, if a man ſhall take a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the common courſe, even of the Chriſtian world, we ſhall find the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Man-kind the verieſt Children, Fools, and Mad-men, that ever Nature yielded. The very folly of Children in ſpending their time in Rattles, and Hobby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes, is more excuſable than theirs, whoſe reaſon and experience ſhould better inſtruct them. There is not any man ſo ſenſeleſs, but he knows he muſt die, and he knows not how ſoon he ſhall hear of that ſad Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and if he were ſo brutiſh as not to think of it, or believe it, yet the weekly Bills of Mortality gives him daily inſtances of it: and yet if we do but obſerve the world of men, they do for the moſt part wholly trifle away their time in doing that which is evil; or in doing nothing; or in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50399:212"/>doing nothing to any purpoſe, or becoming a reaſonable Nature. One man trifles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his time in Feaſting and Jollity; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Gaming or vain and unneceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, in Hunting, Hawking, Bowling, and other waſtful expences of time; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fine Cloaths, Powderings, and Painting, and Dreſſing; another in hunting after Honours and Preferments, or heaping up of Wealth and Riches, and lading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with thick clay; another in trivial ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, poſſibly touching ſome criticiſme or Grammatical nicety; and all theſe men wonderfully pride themſelves, as the only wiſe men, look big and goodly; and when they come to die, all theſe prove either vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and tortures of a miſ-ſpent time; or at leaſt, by the very appearance of ſickneſs and death, are rendred poor, empty, inſipid, and inſignificant things; and then the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is ſent for, and Sacraments, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but penitence and complaints of the vanity of the world, the unhappy expences of time, and all the Wealth and Honour would be preſently Sacrificed for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of thoſe miſ-ſpent hours, and days, and years that cannot be recalled nor redeemed by the price of a world. But the great miſery of man-kind is this, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or will not, in the times of health, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50399:212"/>the conſideration of death and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come; nor put on any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or thoughts that the time will come when things will be otherwiſe with them than now is; or that (they) will be driven into another kind of eſtimate of things than now they have; and this their way is their Folly. Man being in Honour, in Health, in Life, underſtandeth not, but becomes like the Beaſts that periſh.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I come to the <hi>Reaſons why</hi> we ought thus to Redeem our Time, which may be theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our time is <hi>a Talent</hi> put into our hands by the great Lord of the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Heaven and Earth, and ſuch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are to give an account when our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter calls; and it will be a lamentable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when it ſhall conſiſt only of ſuch Items as theſe: <hi>Item,</hi> So much of it ſpent in Plays, and Taverns, and Gaming. <hi>Item,</hi> So much of it ſpent in Sleeping, Eating, Drinking. <hi>Item,</hi> So much ſpent in Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Paſtimes. <hi>Item,</hi> So much ſpent in getting Wealth and Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there remains ſo much which was ſpent in doing nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our time is <hi>a Univerſal Talent,</hi> that every man that lives to diſcretion hath. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man hath not a Talent of Learning, or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50399:213"/>of Wealth, or Honour, or Subtilty, of Wit to account for; but every man that lives to the Age of Diſcretion hath time to account for.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every man hath not only a Talent of Time, but every man hath a <hi>Talent of Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,</hi> to improve this Talent in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure put into his hand. The very works and light of Nature, the very principles of natural Religion are lodged in the hearts of all men; which by the help of his natural reaſon, he might exerciſe to ſome acts of Service, Duty, and Religion towards God. But the Chriſtian hath much more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Redemption and Improvement of our Time, is the next and immediate <hi>End why it is given,</hi> or lent us, and why we are placed in this life; and the waſting of our time is a diſappointment of this very end of our being; for thereby we conſequently diſappoint God of his Glory, and our ſelves of our happineſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Upon the management and diſpoſal of our time, depends <hi>the everlaſting concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Souls. Ex hoc momento depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. The buſineſs we have to do in this life, in order to the cleanſing of our ſouls, and fitting them for glory, is a <hi>great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſs,</hi> and the time we have to live hath <hi>two moſt dangerous qualities</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that buſineſs. 1.

It is very <hi>caſual and incertain;</hi> there be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite accidents, diſeaſes, and diſtempers that cut us off ſuddenly; as acute diſeaſes, ſuch as ſcarce give us any warning; and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how many ſtrings, as it were, thereare to hold us up, and how ſmall and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable they are, and how eaſily broken, and the breach or diſorder of any of the leaſt of them may be an in-let to death, it is a kind of Miracle that we live a month. Again, there be many diſeaſes that render us in a manner dead while we live, as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies, Palſies, Frenzies, Stone, Gout, which render our time either grievous, or very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful to us.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Time once loſt, is loſt for ever: It is <hi>never to be recovered;</hi> all the Wealth of both the <hi>Indies</hi> will not redeem nor recall the laſt hour I ſpent; it ceaſeth for ever.</p>

            <p n="8">8. As our time is ſhort, ſo there be <hi>many things that corrode and waſt that ſhort time;</hi> ſo that there remains but little that is ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our beſt imployment. Let us take but out of our longeſt lives, the weakneſs and folly of Childhood and Youth, the impotency and moroſity of our old Age, the times for eating, drinking, ſleeping, though with moderation, the times of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and indiſpoſedneſs of health, the times of Cares, Journeys and Travel, the times for neceſſary Recreations, interview of Friends and Relations, and a thouſand ſuch expences of time, the reſidue will be but a ſmall pittance for our buſineſs of greateſt moment, the buſineſs I mean, of fitting our ſouls for glory; and, if that be miſ-ſpent, or idely ſpent, we have loſt our treaſure, and the very flower and jewel of our time.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Let us but remember that <hi>when we ſhall come to Die,</hi> and our Souls ſit as it were hovering upon our lips, ready to take their flight, at how great a rate we would then be willing to purchaſe ſome of theſe hours we once trifled away, but we cannot.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Remember that this is the very Elixir, the very Hell of Hell to the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50399:214"/>Spirits, that they had once a time, wherein they might upon eaſie terms, have procured everlaſting reſt and Glory, but they fooliſhly and vainly miſpent that time and ſeaſon, which is now not to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
