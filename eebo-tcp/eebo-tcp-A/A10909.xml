         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And as the Lord hath made your honor to feele the sweetnes of his sonne our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: So I am perswaded that you bende your singular care, and deep consideration, that this our countrey of England, might be free from hereticks &amp; deprauers of Christ his glory.

the body and substance being found in deede but a lumpe of olde worne heresies, newly hatcht by <hi>H N. Fidelitas,</hi> and <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lidad,</hi> men come out of the cloudes, as they would haue the world beleeue.</p>
            <p>And as this doctrine hath increased and spred it selfe in many shires of this Realme. So if I should declare what euent doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in many places, it were scarce credible. The fountaine or foundation thereof, is the opinion that these men haue, that they keepe the law of God in euery point, as he requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er of commeth their doctrine of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, attayned vnto in this life, and as they tearme it, the beginning of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: then being made perfecte, they imagine themselues to be Godded with God, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate to God, I will vse their own tearmes: with whom God in one being of his spirit, is hommisied, or become man.</p>
            <p>Now hauing once planted this doctrine, what Sathan can worke with this perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, is easily perceiued For when this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is once beleeued, that their Elders ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sinne, and whatsoeuer they commit, it cannot be sinne, because they are guyded by the spirite. And when all feare to offend, or conscience of sinne is excluded: to all bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and liberty to liue after our liking, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry window is opened.</p>
            <p>As there is no reason to maintayn this, nor truth to vphold this: So it is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb facs="tcp:16552:4"/>
that the simple people should be war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned to beware of this so suttle a doctrine: which they like very well of, because their teachers and Elders, vnder prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible precepts, delyuered to the simple at the first taste, of a godly life, which asore any thing they must imbrace: with many shewes of mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must they grow to the manly oldnes in the loue, which is that perfection which they dreame of. But the secret part of their doctrine is hid from the most parte: And all their bookes are not made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all, as containing to strong meate for weake stomaches: therfore their glas of righteousnes few must looke into, least their whole vanity, and corruption should be espyed. That booke therefore is a rare birde among this Family. And this suttlety doth Sathan worke to deceaue the simple, to keep certaine secret misteries, and doctrine, to worke admiration in the hartes of deceaued people.</p>
            <p>Right honorable, I haue set downe this part of their doctrine, as a tast: what other matters they maintayne, by perusing this small treat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se, shall easely be espied: how their chiefe Elder <hi>HN.</hi> is exalted, and called a Prophet: and that his prophesies shalbe proued true: and also they account of <hi>HN.</hi> in office to be a priest, and say that through his priestes office, God will receaue all men to mercy: so that our only Lord &amp; Sauiour, is
<pb facs="tcp:16552:5"/>
smally accounted of: his offices are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon <hi>HN.</hi> These thinges, are too too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd, Right honorable, and worthy to be buryed in silence: had not Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> raysed vp his impes to trouble his Church with these blasphemies: agaynst which, I haue bent that poore skill, and force I haue, to displey these men, with their doctrine. There are many, Right honorable: that could better, &amp; more learnedly haue confuted their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: but it is so vayne, and childish, that simple soules, and meanely exersized in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scripture, are sufficiently instructed by the Lord, to manifest all their abhommations.</p>
            <p>The simplier sort of these men, I take to be such as haue a desire to serue the Lord: and yet is their simplicitye caryed away by the Elder sort, or stronger men: conference in my opinion, is the best way to helpe the simple: which the Elder sort can no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:16552:5"/>It appeareth Right honorable, by this prohibition of this Elder: that conference, and disputation is forbidden them: especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Elder sort: but the no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and their simplicitye caryed away, by your suttle speaches.</p>

The thirde distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ambiguous: for of our corrupt nature wee bring forth fleshly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, imaginations, &amp;c. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, are we by nature subiect: if the Lord by his grace, doe not guide vs, and lead vs, and deliuer vs, (yea and so deliuered, if he still doe not protect and gouerne vs, we shall be ready to fall agayne, and agayne: therefore we dayly craue at his handes, saying: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
