            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TItles do not so much make some Men great, as show them to be so; Gold has an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick value in it, even before the Stamp; thus the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of your Family, and the Favours and Smiles of your Prince, which yet are very great Happinesses, are not the essential Ingredients
<pb facs="tcp:54216:3"/>
of your more solid and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Nobility. Vertue and Piety are the great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Stability of the Throne it self; nor is it a less Happiness to a Kingdom, when Nobles inherit their Fathers Vertues together with their Fortunes: Thus should I have look'd upon that long Train of Vertues, which your Lordship takes more pleasure in practising, than in having them recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, almost as hereditary to you, if thereby I might not seem to lessen your personal Title to 'em; and I hope you will give others leave to

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PRefaces are now grown so customary, that Readers generally think themselves neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without 'em, otherwise I should not have concerned my self herein, the subject matter of these Papers not affording any great occasion for such an Address. I hope thou wilt not impute it to any pragmatical conceitedness, if I thus fill up some vacant Minutes, not wholly taken up in the employment of a Country Cure, with such Meditations as these.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Civility of Mr. <hi>Locks</hi> Answer on the one Hand, and the concerns of Truth on the other, did in a great measure, call for some sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Reply; I did not indeed, for some time, think the Controversie betwixt him and me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable enough to trouble either him or my self with these disputes, (and some perh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ps may think so still) but so it happen'd that a friend of mine lately ask'd me, whether I was really satisfied and convin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d with what Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> had writ in his Preface in answer to my former Treatise, I told him I was not; whereupon he reply'd, that then Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> had taught me in his late Controversie with the learned Bishop of <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54216:5"/>
that good manners requir'd me to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the honour he did me, in taking notice of what I formely writ, and that I was bound in Civility to represent the Reasons why I cannot bring my Sentiments wholly to agree with his; for it seems a piece of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ullenness and disrespect to remain dissatisfied, and not acquaint those from whom they may most reasonably expect informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion why they are so.</p>
            <p>And further, when I consider'd that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, <hi>viz. J. S.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Becconsall</hi> had variously disputed those little Controversies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d me, I humbly conceived I might be allow'd more fully to explain my Sense and Meaning therein, and then leave the whole with the judicious and impartial Reader, where it must rest at last.</p>
            <p>Another design of these Papers is to shew the weakness of the Pretences, and the inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siveness of the Deists Arguments; I mean such as they themselves have of late made use of in their own Defence, and I have the rather cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to answer some of those short Letters in the <hi>Oracles of Reason,</hi> both because I hope this may be done without any great tediousness to the Reader, and also because this is not liable to any of those Objections, that the dry method of the Scholastick Ob. and Sol. (as it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call'd) is liable u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to.</p>
            <p>The Deists here plead their own cause, and
<pb facs="tcp:54216:6"/>
if it prove not so strong as was expected, they have no Body to blame but themselves for it, and if they think it has suffer'd by any personal fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, they may at their own pleasure employ bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Advocates.</p>
            <p>I do not here pretend to advance any new Notions, but only with as much strength and clearness as I can to defend the old, and therefore I know what I here write, is not like to meet with any general good reception in such a curious Age as this, only I hope there may be some in the World who will not think the worse of Truth because it is gray headed, Truth being always of the elder House; for though Antiquity has not been so successful in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k it has been more happy in setling Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality npon its true Foundations: I am not for venerable Nonsense being preferr'd before new Sense, nor yet am I for venerable Sense being slighted in respect of new Nonsense, it is the greatest instance of folly imaginable, to run out of one extream into anot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I am apt to believe, that some Opinions now prevailing in the World owe their reception therein to the positiveness of their Patrons, and
<pb facs="tcp:54216:6"/>
to the silence of those of the contrary perswasion, rather than to any strength of Rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WHAT benefit or advantage, as to the concernes of truth and usefull knowledge, the World may receive by that little difference in Dispute betwixt Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> and me, I know not, yet herein I hope, we have given an instance of the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of manageing a controversie without hard words, or unhansome Reflections; and if even this was more generally observed, it would very much advance the interest of truth, however of Love and Friendship in the World among persons of different Opinions. I do not in the least question the truth and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of what he there professes, that he is always ready to renounce his own and receive the opinion of others, according as truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears on either side; yet I hope he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, if I take the freedom to say, that the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54216:8"/>
Instance he there gives of altering of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in reference to the last determination of the will of Man, doth not seem to come up so fully to his purpose, seeing he doth not there so much quit any Opinion of his own to embrace that of anothers, as to renounce the common opinion of most, tho then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by him to entertain an Opinion, I think, purely his own.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> there complains, that his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is often <hi>mistaken, and that he has not always the good Luck to be rightly understood:</hi> This is a common complaint in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and I think, I may also lay a just claime to a share therein, but if I have mistaken his meaning in any thing, whatever the cause might otherwise be, I do insist upon this in my own vindication, that it was not out of any wilful designe: And I furth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I did also read and consider those other places, where he doth positively assert the unchangeable Rules of right and wrong, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I must confess, I did much wonder how so Learned a Man should go so near, as I thought to contradict himself in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where his expressions seem'd, at least, to me then, to infer the the Rules of Vice and Vertue to be of a more changeable Nature, perticularly in that place I quoted <hi>Pa.</hi> 159. <hi>Vertue is every where that which is thought praise-worthy, and nothing else but that which has the allowance of publique esteem, is vertue.</hi>
            </p>

Truly I imagin'd that, in things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Men had generally spoken after the same manner all <hi>England</hi> over.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1284. There were some Grammaticall heresies, that is, some false Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and false Grammer condemn'd, by Arch Episcopal Authority, such as these, <hi>Ego cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nullum nomen est tertiae personae.</hi> far be it from me to impute any such Sollaecismes to this Learned Author; however I think, that I had very good reason to apply these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions to the 1<hi>st.</hi> Person, rather than to any third. 2<hi>ly.</hi> 'Tis observeable that he pleads for this 3<hi>d.</hi> Law, and that with all the force of reason, perhaps, that the thing is capable of, now when Men relate things, as mere mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, what others either do or say, they usually leave 'em to stand or fall by their own evidence; I question whether ever any did so much towards the giving Mens actings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to custome or opinion, the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and grandeur of a Law before, and as for the sanction, with all the Elaborate cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances he has annext to it, I think it is perfectly his own. <hi>P.</hi> 159. 160. §. 12. But I must beg leave here to say that the most Hetrodox writer <hi>(absit verbo invidia)</hi> might perhaps thus take upon him only the same character of a Relator, after he had used and urged all the Arguments that either
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54216:10"/>
reason or Authority could afford him for his particular opinion.</p>
            <p>I do not here say he so far pleaded for this Law of custom or opinion, as to make it the standing Rule of Vice or Vertue truly so call'd, or of right and wrong, as he some times calls 'em, but only that he espous'd the cause and pleaded for that Law further than the thing would well bear. And these are the reasons that did more especially induce me to think, that he did not there take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the bare Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce of a Relator.</p>
            <p>To which I might also add, if it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, what he says. <hi>P.</hi> 159. §. 12. If any one shall imagin that I have forgott my own notion of a Law, when <hi>I make the Law whereby Men judge of Vertue and Vice, to be nothing else, but consent of private Men,</hi> &amp;c. This is not spoken like one, who barely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates matter of fact: Others indeed may, and that justly too, act in obedience to that rule of decency and common repute, yet I think he was one of the first that <hi>made it a Law,</hi> especially such, where by Men judge of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall only add one or two considerations more upon this Subject, before I leave it.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> It seemes a peculiar way of speaking, not yet grown common in the World, when he assignes the Names of <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54216:11"/>
such actions, as are agreeable or dissagreeable to common reputation, and for that reason, because they are so, whereas it always was, and still is the more usual way, not only of judging what things are in their own nature, but also of denominating actions <hi>vertuous</hi> or <hi>vicious</hi> rather from theire agreeableness or disagreeableness to the dictates of reason, and the law of Nature, rather than from the custom of the Place. I grant indeed, that what ever is truly vertuous, is generally counted lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but it is not therefore vertuous, because laudable, but therefore laudable because vertuous.</p>
            <p>Now I think that neither Names, nor the grounds and reasons of 'em ought more to be alter'd, than the Ancient Landmarks in Publick Fields, ought to be remov'd; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but disorder, confusion and needless disputes will arise from both.</p>
            <p>I cannot pretend to be acquainted with all the perticular Modes of speaking throughout the World, yet I much question, whether this be the most common and general accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that word <hi>Vertue, that it is taken most commonly for those actions, which according to to the different opinions of several Countrys are accounted laudable. pag.</hi> 23. § 18. or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not under that formality, because they were so counted. I do not here dispute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54216:11"/>
the true and proper acceptation of the word <hi>Vertue,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> has rightly stated it in the very next period, but only as to matter of fact, even what apprehensions other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions generally had of it.</p>
            <p>I grant indeed that we shall sometimes find different practices in different places about the same thing, and all abounding in their own sense and pleading for the fitness and decency of their own perticular way: Thus some thought it the most Decent and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable way of burying their Dead by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 'em, others by Burning, others by Enterring, and no doubt all thought their own Method the best: But these are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of indifferency, and so do not strictly come up to our present case, but however it may be further ask'd whether or no these several sorts of People did count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves only <hi>Vertuous</hi> herein, and all the rest <hi>Vicious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quakers</hi> are very rude and uncivil in <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> People, as we call it, especially those that are not of their own Club, but I wish they had no greater <hi>Vices</hi> to answer for than this. I have heard of a King that was both blind and Lame, whereupon it was grown in fashion, and a laudable custom in that Court, not to appear but with one Eye cover'd, and with some counterfeiting at least a lameness. These
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54216:12"/>
were indeed very complaisant Courtiers, but why they should be call'd <hi>Vertuous</hi> for their dissimulation I know not, nor whether they were accounted so, even in that Place, where the thing was grown so fashionable,</p>
            <p>Thieves live in good Repute and Credit among themselves, and no doubt applaud their own Exploits in their own Clubs, but yet I much question whether they think vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and rapine to be <hi>Vertues</hi> or no, or do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed call 'em so. They may perhaps employ their wits and fancy's to excuse their way of living, but not to justifie it, nor to raise it to a degree of Vertue; or if we should suppose one among the rest more modest in his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions and not retain such Heroick thoughts of Theft and Murder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as the others did, yet I fancy his Life would not be so uneasie to him as Mr. <hi>Locks</hi> Sanction would seem to make it. <hi>pa.</hi> 159. I scarce think that any Christian Nation (and the Christian World is a Scene large enough for this dispute) doth call that a <hi>vertue,</hi> which either is in it self, or by any other Christian Nation is called a <hi>vice.</hi> Whoredome, tho' in some Countries permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and but too much in fashion, yet it is not even there call'd a <hi>vertue,</hi> tho' perhaps it may be counted a lesser <hi>vice.</hi> And why should we here in <hi>England</hi> begin to unhinge and unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54216:12"/>
whose sense and meaning always was and still ought to be more fix'd and constant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. this Law of Opinion and Reputation, as it is made to Constitute a distinct Law, is not well grounded, for a Law is always suppos'd to bring men under an obligation, now the things in fashion among men, if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of Nature, let mens opinions of 'em be what they will, yet they are no Law to any one, and if they be agreeable to the Law of Nature, then they do so far <hi>coincidere</hi> with the Divine Law, and do not constitute a new Species of Law.</p>
            <p>But I must remember what Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds me of, that he only relates what others say, not what he defends. But if so, then I can mention several other rules, which men sometimes make Lawes to themselves, <hi>viz.</hi> their respective tempers and humours, and the prejudices of Education: which are as much Laws to these men in their respective Clubs, as opinion and reputation are to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in theirs.</p>
            <p>But he goes on, <hi>whatsoever Authority, he says, I place</hi> in my old English <hi>Dictionary, it no where tells me, that the same action is not in credit, call'd and reputed a vertue in one place, which being in disrepute passes for and under the name of vice in another.</hi> But with submission I must tell him, that what ever Authority he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54216:13"/>
places in his new way of speaking, yet, tho' our English Dictionarys (his as well as mine) no where say, that the same actions are not variously reputed, so or so in various places (for that is not their business) yet they no where say, that they are. For both our Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionarys and Moral Philosophers (I appeal to both) tell us, that vice and vertue are much what the same with good and evil, sin and duty, and by consequence, that they did not, at least in those times so much as receive their denomination from Custom, but if he had instanc'd in one perticular action in the whole Christian World, which in one Place was counted a vertue and in another a vice, it would have added much light to the whole, and better explain'd his meaning.</p>
            <p>The <hi>taking notice that Men bestow the names of vertue and vice, according to the rule of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, is all I have done, or can be laid to my charge to have done, towards the making of vice vertue, and vertue vice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I would only ask whether this, of Mens bestowing the names of vertue and vice, according to the rule of reputation, be in it self a just well grounded and reasonable action, if it be, why doth he not assert and defend it, if it be not, why doth he found a Law <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>opinion and reputation,</hi> upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable and ill grounded actions of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:54216:13"/>But he seemes to commend me, (upon what account I know not) for <hi>taking the alarm,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>euen at expressions, which standing alone by themselves might sound ill and be suspected</hi> I know not what he means by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions standing alone by themselues.</hi> I hope he will grant, that several expressions, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone by themselves, that is at certain dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, yet all upon the same account justly exceptionable, may be taken notice of; and I suppose he now understands, that it was not only one single expression, dropt as it were by chance from his Pen, that I found fault with but with his whole way of arguing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that perticular.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Some think this to be a reflection upon my Function, as if its proper business was to be employ'd in impertinencies, but I am willing, according to my Function, to put the most favourable interpretation upon things that they are capable of bearing, <hi>that I forgive his Citing my words, as he there does,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis my happiness, that I find, that some Men, as they are great, so they are also merciful. I also thank him for the respect he seems to show to the Function, but Zeal without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (as he must suppose mine to be, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise I should never have found fault, where there was no ground for it) is no

He also blames me for quoting that Place of St. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Whatsoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever things are of good report, if there be any vertue, if there be any Praise,</hi> &amp;c.

Truly I am not yet convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that I quoted it in any other sense, than the Apostle spoke it, and if he us'd it in any other, I cannot tell how to help it, he must look to that, but he says, he <hi>brought this passage of St.</hi> Paul, to show <hi>that for reasons he there gives, Men in that way of denominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their actions, do not for the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gs are of good report, if there be any vertue, if there be any praise, think of these things.</hi> For indeed St. <hi>Paul</hi> here supposes some things either in themselves of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or in their own natures indifferent, and by the Innocent and la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dable custom of that place made so, and then they are the subject matter of a Command, <hi>think of these things</hi>: but then by bare mentioning things of good report, he does not concern himself in that question, how far Men in denominating their actions according to common repute, may or may not vary from the Law of Nature:</p>
            <p>Tho' by the way it seems but a very humble commendation of this Law of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reputation, which is attended with all these diminutions, <hi>That it is such as (only) for the most part doth not much vary from the Law of Nature.</hi> That is, it may sometimes, nay frequently too, and in some degree vary from it.</p>
            <p>But St. <hi>Paul,</hi> being an inspired Teacher, certainly would not appeal to common repute under those Formalitys and disadvantagious circumstances, seeing he was there laying down Rules for the guidance of all succeeding Ages of the Church So that the <hi>things of good report,</hi> which the Apostle appeals to, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap>,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54216:15"/>
but alwayes agree with the Law of Nature, or at least were not contrary to it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Exhortations of Inspired Teachers have not feared to appeal to common repute, &amp;c.</hi> By this must be understood such an appeal, as refers to Practice, <hi>think of these things</hi>; now I durst appeal to Mr, <hi>Lock</hi> himself whether the Apostle would exhort Men to the practice of things of good report, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction or limitation; since he himself doth acknowledge that Men, in denominating their actions according to this Law, do (only) <hi>For the most part not much vary from the Law of nature. Whereby, even in the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners, the true Boundarys of the Law of nature, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>These are the Words, upon account of which he blam'd me, because I did omit 'em; but doth he indeed think, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle in this case would have appealed to such a state of things without exception, wherein the true Boundarys of the Law of Nature were, (only) <hi>pretty well preserv'd.</hi> Tis granted on all hands, that the Law of Nature ought indeed to be the Rule of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and vice; but it seems it is not always actually so: If this be not the meaning of that expression <hi>pretty well preserved,</hi> I know
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54216:15"/>
not what is. And what advantage is this to his cause? I hope Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> is not one of those, who would here tell us, that the rule, which the Apostle here layes down, is not absolutely certain and infallible, but only such, as for the most part, and more generally is true: For this would ill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with the Caracter of an <hi>Inspired Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>:</p>
            <p>Nor do I see, what tolerable Sense can be made of these words, <hi>If there be any vertue, If there be any prayse,</hi> Or why they are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, according to Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the Place.</p>
            <p>I have insisted the longer upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and represented my thoughts the more variously, that if possible I might the more certainly hit the Authors meaning, for I must confess, that such is either the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Expres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But then as to Naturall notions, he says, we are better agreed than I thought of; if so, I am glad of it, for I can assure him, I take no pleasure in having any difference with any one: But I am afraid, there will, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination, be found some small difference betwixt us, in this particular also.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:54216:16"/>In stating the Question, he says, <hi>I leave nothing in it contrary to what he had said.</hi> I shall here first Transcribe my stating of it, so far as is necessary in this perticular, that so the Reader may be the better able to judge betwixt us. <hi>P.</hi> 52. <hi>These Naturall notions, are not so Imprinted upon our Soules, as that they naturally and necessarily exert themselves (even in Children and Ideots) without any assistance from the outward Senses, or without the help of some previous cultivation, for thus reason it self, which yet, we say, is natural to a Man is not so born with him, but that it requires some Supervenient assistances, before it arrive at the true exercise of it self, and it is as much as I here contend for, if these notions be in the same sence connaturall to the Soul, as Reason it self is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And farther, the use of our understanding being First supposed that is, our faculties labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of no naturall defect, nor deprived of those other advantages, that God and Nature have made necessary there unto, then our Souls have a natural power of finding, or framing such principles or propositions, the truth or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof no wayes depends upon the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of sence or observation.</hi> And now doth Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> indeed say, that these notions are in the same sense Connatural to the Soul, as reason it self is? Doth he indeed grant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54216:16"/>
to our Souls a native power of finding or frameing such principles or propositions, the truth or knowledge whereof no ways depends upon the Evidence of sense or Observation? and yet, methinks he must grant this too, if he hold to his <hi>intuitiue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>; and if so then we are better agreed, than I thought of: But then what becomes of that pompous principle, that sensation and reflexions upon sensible Impressions, are the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals of all our knowledge; but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, <hi>All that he says for innate, imprinted or inpress'd notions (for of innate idea's he says nothing at all) amounts only</hi> &amp;c.

That if there be innate notions, that then there must be innate idea's. I doe indeed assert innate notions, in the sense before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, but yet I do not say, that all the respective ideas, <hi>viz.</hi> simple ideas relating to those notions are innate: I shall only instance in one or two, <hi>Cogito, ergo sum,</hi> bare nothing cannot produce any real Being.

            <p>Nor do I see how this way of resolveing knowledge into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus I have a generall notion of a <hi>Book</hi> for example; at the first sight, now if I should resolve this notion into its ideall principles, into all its simple ideas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I believe I should at last have no better notion or idea of it than I had before.</p>

and also of life or perception and self motion.</hi> 2ly. <hi>From Sensation, we have the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the simple sensible ideas of a Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and of some action by which we put an end to that perception and motion in the Man; all whieh simple ideas are comprehended in the word Murther.</hi> I suppose, he design'd here more particularly to explain to us the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Murther, according to his ideall way, by sensation and reflection.

               </hi> in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, <hi>Viz.</hi> Of Murther, he would certainly stare at us, and perhaps think that we were not much overgrown, either with Law or Reason; but never understand the nature of Murther one jot the better for it. I never yet observ'd that <hi>Lushington's Logick,</hi> which is either a new way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or a new way of expressing old thoughts ever made that improvement of knowledge in the World, which the Author at first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps promised himself it would do.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54216:18"/>
upon the operations of the mind, as employed and exercised about these outward impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, now one might have thought, that the streames would not have risen above the Fountains head, and that the reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these outward impressions would not have produc'd idea's of a quite different nature from the rest. So that that which Mr. <hi>Norris. P.</hi> 61. Of his remarks upon the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> puts upon these ideas, seemes to be the most naturall and obvious sense and meaning of 'em, <hi>Viz. That these ideas of reflection are but a secondary sort of ideas, that result from the various compositions, and modifications of these primary ones of sensation.</hi> Otherwise this notion of his, which he seems to advance with some kind of pompous traine of thought, as if something out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road of former methods, will, at last dwindle into this, which hath been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and generall opinion of all the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring part of Mankind herein, that all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge proceeds either from the senses, or from the understanding, in its most extensive capacity, however qualified and disposed for that purpose. But by reflection among other things he includes the power of <hi>negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Thus from conception of <hi>some thing</hi> by negation hereof he forms an idea of <hi>nothing</hi>: But now methinks we are got far
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54216:19"/>
aboue the sphere of sensation, for <hi>nothing</hi> cannot be the object of sense, nor make any impression upon the outward organs, and yet the Soul can frame propositions of as great truth and evidence from this <hi>nothing</hi>; as it can from <hi>something Ex. gr. bare nothing cannot produce a reall being,</hi> but to proceed.</p>
            <p>He sayes that I <hi>make innate notions condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall things depending upon the concurrence of severall other circumstances, in order to the Souls exerting them</hi>; and so <hi>leave nothing in the stating of the Question, contrary to what he had said before.</hi> But I shall quit the place, upon which he grounds this, and then leave it to the Reader to judge, whether he hath done me right or no, <hi>P.</hi> 78. Of my former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. I was there complaining of some Men who will put such a sense upon these Words, <hi>innate or naturall, as if a thing could not be thus naturall or innate to the Soul, unless it did so immediately and necessarily stare Children and Fools in the face, that they must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily assent thereto, even before, by the common course of nature, they are capable of assenting to any thing; whereas those who defend this Question, make these naturall or innate notions more conditionall things, depending on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of severall other circumstances,</hi> &amp;c. Now I appeal to the Reader, whether these notions may not be more conditionall things,

            <p>And then as to what I mean by that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious cultivation, or those other circumstances,</hi> &amp;c. He may observe, that I always intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce these expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that, if I should say, that the Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, and so qualify'd exerts those notions, so, as to suppose some footsteps of these truths imprinted or interwoven in the very essentiall constitution of the Soul, as such that is, as rational, I think it an assertion

not unreasonable in it self, however not possible to be disprov'd, or confuted by any one.</p>

            <p>I think this is much what the same with the former, especially if we consider, that I do not h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I shall here further take notice of a Cavil of the Atheists, who make it an Objection against the being of a God, that they do not discover him without any application, in spight of their corrupt wills and debaucht under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings; if such a God (say they) as we are told of, had Created and Form'd us, surely he would have left upon our minds a native and indelible inscription of himself, whereby we must need have felt him, even without seeking, and believ'd in him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we would or no.</p>
            <p>I shall first consider this as a mere Cavil of the Atheists, tho' as it is manag'd by some, it seems rather to be made use of as an Argument against the natural impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God upon our minds, than any proof against his being.</p>

            <p>But they say, that such an impression would have rendred the belief of a God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> because the Scripture doth not particularly insist upon it, for that purpose.

            <p>But then I would only aske these oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of this Naturall character of God upon our mindes, whether they do grant any Naturall notions of good or evill; if they do, I know not why they should deny this of God, upon which the other do depend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that I humbly conceive, that these Men, whilest they thus goe about to answer

            <p>MR. <hi>Lock</hi> in his Preface says, he was in the Chapter there mentioned, not laying down morall Rules, <hi>but enumerating the Rules Men made use of in morall rela:+tions, whether those Rules were true or false</hi> but certainly it is not so well consistent with that great Character that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> beares in the World, to spend time in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Rules in things relating to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, without any respect to their being either true or false, considering the bad use the vulgar and inconsiderate People may, and frequently do make of such doubtf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll discourses; Men may thus write for ever, and yet the World never the better, but possibly much worse for their Writeing: But the Rules he there takes notice of are these three: 1<hi>st.</hi> The Divine Law. 2<hi>d.</hi> Humane Law. 3<hi>ly.</hi> The Law of Opinion, or Reputation. Now the Divine Law is always true, Humane Law always Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, but the Law of Fashion or Opinion,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54216:26"/>
which is neither always true. nor always Obligatory, seemes to be very unjus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly joynd with the two former.</p>
            <p>But I must doe Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat right, as to take notice of what he says in the last §. of that Chapter. There he tells us, <hi>that tho' the Rule be erronious, and I mistaken in it, yet the agremeent or disagreement of that, which I compare with it, is evidently known by me; wherein consists my knowledge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:</hi> But what an insignificant piece of knowledge is this, thus to know Relation, for when I see a Pedler measuring me off so much Stuffe by a false Yard, I see indeed the relation, that one bears to the other, and that agreement betwixt 'em but what satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is that to me, for the Cheat that is put upon me by the false measurer. <hi>But tho' mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring by a wrong Rule I shall thereby be brought to judge amiss of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'s morall rectitude, because I have tryed it by that, which is not the true rule,</hi> &amp;c. Here Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> confesses that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all rectitude consists in the truth of the rule, not in the agreement of any action to a rule, whether that rule be true or false. Now let us compare such or such an action to the Law or Rule of Fashion or reputation; I find it agreeable thereunto: What then follows? Why, then it follows, that it is agreeable thereunto; nothing further can
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54216:27"/>
follow hence, because as yet I know not whether that Law of Custome or reputation be true or no.</p>
            <p>So that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> here seems to make use of his own authority in a great measure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal that Law of Custom or fashion, which in the former part of that <hi>Chap.</hi> he seems to enact.</p>
            <p>But now in his Preface he says, he never endeavour'd to make it a Law; if so, then what meanes the 12<hi>th.</hi> §. Wherein he seems to assume to himself the honour of making it such, and further adds a Sanction thereunto, I think perfectly of his own Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration: Tho' indeed the Sanction doth not seem to stand good, even upon his own principles. For §. 5. He tells us, <hi>that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good and evill is the conformity or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement of our voluntary actions to some Law, whereby good and evill is drawn on us from the will and power of the Law-maker, and by the Decree of the Law maker.</hi> Now I suppose no particular Society or Club of Men ever met together to constitute such respective sanctions to actions agreeable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r disagreeable to Fashion or Reputation; for he tells us. §. 10. That <hi>this approbation or dislike, doth by a secret and tacit consent,</hi> (which certainly is some thing different from the will, power and Decree of the Law-maker) <hi>establish it self in the severall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54216:27"/>
Societies, and Clubs of Men in the World:</hi> And §. 6. <hi>It would be in vain for one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent being to set a rule to the action of another, if he had it not in his power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or punish the compliance with, or devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this Rule, by some good and evill, that is not the natural product, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the action it self, for that being a naturall convenience or inconvenience, would operate of it self without a Law.</hi> Now if an action be truly morally good, praise and approbation is the natural product and consequence of such an action; and if it be really bad, then blame and censure; but now these do not come up to the rewards and punishments above mentioned, such as are extrinsick to the nature of the action, and not the natural and necessary results of it.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Becconsall</hi> hath in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure prevented me on this Subject, for which I thank him.</p>
            <p>But <hi>I.S.</hi> P. 271. <hi>p.</hi> 199.200. Of his reflections upon Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> there speaking of this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Controversy betwixt Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> and me, says, that <hi>Mr.</hi> Lock <hi>has so perfectly clear'd that point in his Preface' that none can now remain unsatisfi'd, for who can hinder Men from sancying and nameing things, as they list.</hi> none indeed can hinder Men from doing thus, but this they ought not to do, unless
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54216:28"/>
they think and Write without any respect either to truth or goodness, and when <hi>Men fancy and name things, as they list,</hi> if this be done without any ground of reason, and contrary to the generall practice of Mankind, I humbly conceive, there is no reason, that this should satisfy any one: But then <hi>pa.</hi> 274. He says, <hi>I think it had been better and more unexceptionable, to have called such good and bad dispositions (Reputed vertues and vices) than to joyne those qualities in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocall appellation,</hi> &amp;c. Here he seemes to cast the Cause on my side againe: But we are all partys here, and so must appeal to the impartiall and juditious Reader, the only supreme Judge in things of this nature,</p>

                  </gap>ir own speculations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take notice of a certain kind of novell affected way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of late prevaiing in the World, even
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54216:28"/>
among great Phylosophers, whether it be to gratify their own curiosity of speaking, or that they pretend to advance some new notion by this new way of expressing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, I know not; but this is certain, that vicious and ill minded Men do make use hereof, especially when tis apply'd to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Morality, to worse purposes, than our modern Philosophers probably ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Malbranch,</hi> pa. 15. <hi>Paragraph,</hi> 7. Of his late Treatise of Morality, It is <hi>certain that universall reason is always the same, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is immutable, and yet morality changes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cording to places and times.</hi> Bad Men from such instances, as these, take occasion to undermine the very Fundamentals of all Religion, and wholly to resolve morality into mere custome and Education. Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> indeed did say in his 1<hi>st.</hi> Edition of his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, that <hi>nothing else but that which has the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of publick esteem, is vertue.</hi> But he altred it in his 2d. and probably Mr. <hi>Malbranch</hi> if he have the same candor and ingenuity, will doe the same too. Mens apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning some points of Morality may vary and alter, but the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves never do. <hi>It is a vertue, he says, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Germans to drink hard.</hi> But this is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an assersion both false and scandalous,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54216:29"/>
for who ever said that the personal fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures of private Persons can make that a vertue any where which is not so in it self, neither do I think, that this of Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard, I suppose, he meanes to excess, is generally counted a vertue, even in <hi>Germany:</hi> Thus some Men stick not to violate all the Rules of order, truth and justice, only to advance a notion false in it self, and dangerous in its consequences, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Morality changes according to times and places.</p>
            <p>Vice and Errour are of a Progressive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thus Men first live as if there were no God, then they wish there was none, then they set their understandings to defend, what their Vicious and Corrupt affections first prompted them to desire: Thus from Atheisme in practise they proceed to Atheisme in speculation. So also some Men speak, as if there were no fixt and standing rules of morality,; others, being prompted thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by their vicious humours, take the hint, and hence boldly assert that there are no such things; thus taking away the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all natural Religion.</p>
            <p>I shall here beg leave to reflect upon one or two passages more in his Treatise <hi>Pa.</hi> 414. <hi>De inquirenda veritate.</hi> He tells us, that God has instituted a Natural Union betwixt

            <p>I could have wish'd, that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> had further explain'd, what relation those op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the mind, which he calls Ideas of reflexion, have to the precedent impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions made upon the sense <hi>Pa.</hi> 44. § 24. That seems to suppose sensible impressions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to preceed the reflexions of the mind. But on the other hand, Intuitive knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> of the existence of our Souls doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suppose, nor is it self any operation of the mind about any sensible impressions going before.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> charg'd me with some kind of a inconsistency of expression in one place say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that the Soul exerted those notions,</hi> in one another, <hi>that they exerted themselves:</hi> But tis a great sign, that matter and Argument run low, when Men thus meanly carp at words:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54216:31"/>
I hope I have sufficiently vindicated my self, as to that particular; but if I should follow the example of so great a Master, and be thus severely critical, it perhaps would be difficult for himself to avoid the like cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. <hi>pa.</hi> 323. of his Essay, §. 14. 1<hi>st.</hi> Edit. <hi>Knowledge is the consequence of the ideas, that are in our minds, what ever they are, and produce generall certain p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>opositions.</hi> I dare not be over confident that I rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the period, but if this be the sense of it, which seemes to be so, that the ideas produce these generall certain propositions, I humbly conceive it the more proper way of speaking, to say, that the Soul by the aids and assistance of these ideas produce, those propositions, than that the ideas them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should do it. I do not speak this as if there was here any just occasion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but only to show, how easily men may be ill natur'd, if they pleas'd.</p>
            <p>I am sorry I have not the concurrence of Mr. <hi>Becconsall's</hi> opinion in this point too of innate notions, I shall therefore brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine some passages of his, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this subject, first I do not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, why he should grant the Law of nature to be innate, or implanted in the minds of Men, as he tells us, <hi>Pa,</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> That <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he very frame and Constitution of their Natures.</hi> and Pa. 6. <hi>The Law of Nature is implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the minds of Men, as rationall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:</hi> And yet at the same time to reject the Doctrine of innate inscriptions, as he calls 'em. <hi>Pa.</hi> 75. Whereas I humbly conceive, that the Law of Nature is either the same with these naturall inscriptions, or innate notions, or the one so Founded, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they must both stand, or fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if by being implanted in the minds of Men, he mean only a power or faculty in the Soul of collecting those truths by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional disquisitions, then I think, he has not done right neither to himself, nor his Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by so expressing it.</p>
            <p>But he says, <hi>Pa.</hi> 75. that the <hi>frame, and order of things both within, and without us, with the exercise of our own facultys upon 'em will present us with a Scheme of moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a true measure of action, and that too as clearly, as if it was imprinted upon the mind, with the first lineaments of its being.</hi> I do not deny the great use, and advantage of our naturall faculties, in order to that end, that is, to those whose circumstances are such, that they have abilitys, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to employ 'em so, that is, Christians may possibly do it, but a great part of the Gentile world cannot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54216:32"/>But how does he prove, that this Scheme of duty will thus be <hi>as clearly</hi> presented to us, as if it was imprinted with the First li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments of our beings: This seemes to be barely asserted without proof: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the contrary seemes more probable, that the double evidence of natural inscription and Rationall deduction would add to the cleareness of the thing.</p>
            <p>And therefore he says, <hi>There seemes to be no visible necessity for haveing recourse to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ideas, or inscriptions.</hi> Those who assert innate inscriptions justly suppose themselves on the defensive part, and they who write against 'em can challenge no other, than that of opponents. Now barely to plead the no necessity of a thing is no necessary argument against him, who positively asserts the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, that it is so, for many things may be, and are so, of which perhaps there is no necessity, that they should be so: And this seemes sufficient to abate the force of the Argument; If nothing further could be added; for what if God has given us greater assistances, than perhaps were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary; in a thing of so great concernment; we have no reason to take it ill.</p>
            <p>But then why may we not assert, if not a necessity, yet a great conveniency of these
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54216:33"/>
naturall notions, <hi>viz.</hi> In respect of that part of the Gentile world, who have neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility nor inclination to make such profound disquisitions into the nature of Man, and the reason of things, as are necessary to attain to the naturall knowledge of duty: And if Mr. <hi>Becconsall</hi> had more fully consider'd the Barbarous state of the greatest part of the Heathen World, tis probable he would have found 'em subjects not capable of such rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall enquiry's, as his way of Arguing sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses 'em. But he goes on,</p>
            <p>If <hi>innate ideas be serviceable to Mankind, they must be so in order to supply the defects <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f reason, and consequently they seem to be exempt from the disquisitions of reason.</hi> These natural notions of truth, and goodness are some of the greatest strokes, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the Image of God, imprinted upon the minds of Men, in order to make them what they are, rational and Religious; now if this Learned Author, or any else call this a supplying the defects of Reason, I shall not much oppose it; only I should rather call 'em the fundamental principles of all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning: <hi>And consequently they seem to be exempt from the disquisitions of Reason.</hi> I do not understand the necessity of this consequence at all, for how can these things be fit and proper aids to supply the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54216:33"/>
defects of reason, if they themselves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or dare not undergoe the most exact trialls and disquis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tions of reason.</p>
            <p>He gives his reason in the following words. <hi>For if innate ideas are to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and judged on by the working of reason,</hi> What then? We might have imagin'd, that the inference from hence would have been, either 1<hi>st.</hi> That then there are no such things as these Native Inscriptions, or 2<hi>ly.</hi> That they are not serviceable in order to supply the defects of reason, or 3<hi>ly.</hi> That they were exempt from the disquisitions of reason, but its none of these, but only this, <hi>Then reason it self will answer all the ends and designes of a reasonable being:</hi> But if it does, this seemes only to extend to the Christian World; reason does but very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently perform this among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. But he says, <hi>It does it as effectually, as if a digest of Laws were originally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded on the mind.</hi> But how doth he prove, that the Heathens may not thank those Native impressions, that they are not sunk lower into Barbarisme than indeed they are: or supposing, that they did enjoy a greater and freer use of reason, than I am afraid they do, yet how doth he prove, that they owe the light of truth and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to duty merely to their rationall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirys
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54216:34"/>
in contradistinction to, or seperation from these innate notions, or not rather to the benign influence that these later (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in conjunction with the former) have upon them. But <hi>pa.</hi> 76. He says, <hi>That the Doctrine of innate ideas must be laid aside, since we cannot conceive, that a wise Creator should establish any ordinance without some special ends, and use annex'd to it, I mean such, as are not served any other way.</hi> But to this I answer, 1<hi>st.</hi> That what he there supposes, is not yet sufficiently demonstrated, <hi>viz.</hi> That Men generally may as well come to the knowledge of their Duty, by such rational enquirys, as they may by these native inscriptions. 2<hi>ly.</hi> How doth he prove, that it is inconsistent with the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Divine providence to appoint the joint concurrence of two things, as in this case, naturall inscription and rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, as meanes in order to the same end, they mutually supporting, defending, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming each other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P</hi>a. 77. <hi>In a word then, tho' the sacred lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage seems to favour the notion of native inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet it may be justly r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>solved into metaphor and figure,</hi> &amp;c, But it is some advantage to the notion, that the sacred Language favours it, especially since the assertors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are defenders of that Text, and found
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54216:34"/>
their opinion upon it: And therefore 'tis not sufficient for him to say, that the Sacred Language may be resolved into a Metaphor, but he must prove, that it must necessarily be so interpreted; and here the assertors of these Inscriptions may more justly say, that the Text <hi>may</hi> be understood in the plain, obvious, and literal sense of the words, therefore there is no need, no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of a Metaphor.</p>
            <p>I do not here speak any thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the excellency, and useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those powers, and facultys that God has endued us with in order to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a rule of action, yet I can scarce be perswaded, that the mere exercise of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in those circumstances of time, and place before mentioned, will do it <hi>as clearly and as effectually,</hi> as if a digest of Laws were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally recorded on the mind, tho' I do not say that any such digest is thus recorded, only some of the primary, original and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws of Nature, or some greater stroaks thereof are originally communicated to the Soul, yet in a way suteable to the nature of the things thus communicated, and to the nature of the Soul, the Subject of 'em.</p>
            <p>But here if I may speak my own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conjecture, I think, these rational en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirys
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54216:35"/>
by the use of our facultys may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter serve the designes of truth, than they can those of goodness, and be more avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the founding of intellectual, and notional, rather then Moral, and practical Principles upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pa.</hi> 75. He says, that if <hi>it be allow'd, that probabilitys may determine our judgments in this matter, the doctrine of innate Ideas is rather to be rejected, than retain'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if probabilitys will avail any thing, I doubt not but the Doctrine of innate Ideas has its probabilitys too, as 1. Since this Doctrine of native Ideas or inscriptions (he means the same by both) is not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mere indifferency, but has a very useful influence both upon natural and Reveal'd Religion, is it not therefore the more probable to be true? And further, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s it probable that the Apostle, <hi>Ro.</hi> 2. 15. would positively and plainly say that <hi>this Law of Nature was written upon the hearts of the Gentiles,</hi> if it really and truly was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o? 2. Is it probable, that God would leave the Gentile World to the guidance of that reason, which in their circumstances, could not be any tolerable direction to 'em, either in the ways of truth or holyness, without some other (at least more probable,

            <p>It were to be wisht that Discourses of this nature, to prove the very principles of Christianity, were neither seasonable nor necessary, but such is the iniquity of the age we live in, that deisme appears bare-fac'd in a Christian State, that it bears it self high upon the pretended strength of its own cause, and acknowledges no Oracles, but those of its own, <hi>Viz. Of Reason.</hi>

            <p>If one might venture to guess at the causes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54216:40"/>
of their mistakes (to omit that unfixedness of mind, and that affectation of popularity, hereby to gain to themselves the reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men of more than ordinary parts) they perhaps might be first occasion'd by such steps and methods, as these.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Reason being both a name and thing, which always was, and ever will be justly valued, and esteemed in the World, and there being a time, when reason, or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy was the great, if not the only guide to Man in things relating either to this World, or the other, that being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule, that we know of, that God gave the Heathens to direct 'em to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happiness; this perhaps might be one occasion of the present Deisme of the age.</item>
               <item>2. It has been the misfortune, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation has laid under, in the opinion of some Men, tho' without any just ground, that it bears a direct opposition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to reason, now these Men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveing and propagateing this opinion, as much as was possible in the World, they built themselves a Reputation by advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reason, which was once a sufficient guide to Men, even above, and in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to Revelation.</item>
               <item>3<hi>dly.</hi> 'Tis not improbable, but that these
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54216:41"/>
Men may be offended at the severity of the Christian Religion, not that I here go about to accuse 'em of immoralitys, no! Their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Education, their Candid temper, and their true and just sense of things, which otherwise they entertain, forbid me to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour any such thoughts of 'em, yet I would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal here even to their own private sentiments whether there be not somthing of truth in what I here intimate, and that they could be willing to purchase Heaven at some easier rate, or more agreeable to their particular humors or inclinations, than that prescrib'd by the Gospel.</item>
               <item>4. Perhaps the Severe Apprehensions, which some Christians entertain concerning the desperate estate of all Heathens may make some run into the other extream, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Natural Religion is sufficient for all, in order to Eternal Happiness, which is so unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, as they think, deny'd to some for such. But to passe by these Conjectures.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now in order to the clearer stating of the question betwixt us, we must consider. 1. That since we have been now above 16. hundred Years in possession of our Christian Religion in particular, and much longer of a reveal'd Religion in general, therefore the deist can claim no other part
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54216:41"/>
in this dispute, than that of an opponent, and here he must prove the History of the Gospel, as to matters of fact, to be false, and those ancient Apologys, for, and those more Modern defences of Christianity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient.</p>
            <p>If it be reply'd, that Natural Religion preceded Revelation, and so was the more Ancient. I answer. 1. Some are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that God immediately after the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Adam,</hi> did give him either an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or outward revelation or both, of things covenient or necessary for him to be known <hi>then,</hi> tho' perhaps they were such, as in progress of time, and long study and observation might have been found out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>Here I must confess, we have no certain Rule to guide us, but must only go by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, such as are more rationally and piously credible. But if after all any one will positively say, that such was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Natural reason before the Fall, that all those things relating more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to <hi>that present State of affairs,</hi> might have been found out by it self, I shall not much oppose it; however this is certain, that God immediately after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> did reveal the Gospel to him in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, by the Promise of the Messiah, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54216:42"/>
this the Deist must acknowledge, unless he can prove the History of <hi>Moses</hi> to be false.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irst Ages of the World God did convey his will and pleasure to Men by Angels upon extraordinary occasions, so that they could not be even then, said to be absolutely without Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They had Tradition, which was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounded and of more Authority <hi>then,</hi> than it can pretend to now, because of the long life of the Patriarchs, so that it did not go through so many hands, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not so liable to be corrupted; tho' I do nothere suppose this Tradition to extend to Moral Dutys.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Notwithstanding all these helps, and assistances, they felt the sad want of a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule to direct 'em, for those first Ages of the World soon degenerated into Idolat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and this and worse would be the Fate of the present Age if God in judgment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ould remove the Gospel from us.</p>
            <p>But to return, the Deist must 2<hi>dly</hi> prove, that it is a thing contrary to the Divine Nature to make any further Declaration of his will, than what he has made known by the light of Nature, he cannot say, that this is contrary to the free, and positive
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54216:42"/>
determination of the Divine Will, for how can he know this, seeing he doth not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any outward Declaration of Gods will ever made to Man. If he say that God never made any but only this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he would make no more, but what he had discovered to Man by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: I hope he will prove what he says, and show where ever God made any such Declaration: If he say that there was no need of any further: This is a very weak way of argueing against matter of fact: If I should say, that there is nothing writ in a certain Book call'd <hi>the Oracles of Reason,</hi> in defence of Deisme, because there was no need of it, there was enough writ of that before, I believe he would not grant the Argument to be of any force.</p>
            <p>Some are of Opinion, that that Book call'd <hi>the Oracles of Reason</hi> is not worth the taking notice of by way of Answer, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they say, such as would soon dye of it self; I must confess I have no great opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the performance therein, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Letters of those Gentlemen one to another, (I do not speak of the Translations) not that I here reflect upon the abilitys of the Persons, but of the weakness of the cause, that was not capable of a better defence.</p>

            <p>But because some are apt to look upon this as an argument of the strength of a cause, when no one vouchsafes an answer to it, tho' perhaps the true reason is, because they think it does not deserve any, I shall therefore briefly consider that part of it, which is writ in favour of Deisme, if not for its own sake, yet for the sake of those, who are too apt to overvalue every thing, that may seem to gratify their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate inclinations, and if some think as meanly of this, as others do of that, I am very well satisfy'd, <hi>if they should dye both together.</hi>

               </gap>iceing was a thing early prevailing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54216:44"/>
in the World, and it will be very difficult for the Deists, according to their principles to give any tolerable account hereof. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Christians are divided in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons herein, some asserting a Divine positive command, and Revelation of God to <hi>Adam,</hi> tho' not mention'd in Scripture; neither is this, say they, any Argument that there was no such thing, because <hi>Scripturae silentium non est semper argumentativum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others suppose Sacrifices founded in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, tho' this, say some, is not altogether so reasonable, because they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how naturall reason abstracted from a Divine command, could suggest, that God could be acceptably worship'd by the destruction of his Creatures.</p>
            <p>Others distinguish betwixt Typical and Eucharisticall Sacrifices, these latter, they say, may be founded in Nature, tho' the same cannot be so easily granted of the other: What the reall truth herein is, perhaps is not so easie to determine. However, the Deists seem here to have a particular notion of their own, <hi>Viz.</hi> That Sacrifices were only Typicall of repentance, and sorrow for sin, but this without any ground either from reason, or authority.</p>
            <p>Having premised this in generall, I shall
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54216:45"/>
come now more particularly to examine, what he says upon this subject.</p>
            <p>God is not to be worshiped by Sacrifices, he says, because <hi>Sponsio non valet, ut alter pro altero puniatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he seemes to reflect upon the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our blessed Saviour. But why should any such maxim be of more authority than those of St. <hi>Paul?</hi> Neither doth this, when rightly understood, any ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that commutation of punishment asserted by Christianity.</p>
            <p>For we commonly say, that <hi>volenti non fit injuria</hi> and that truly too, with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of these two conditions. 1<hi>st.</hi> That the Person so undertaking may lawfully do it, that is, if he be not under any moral, or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical obligation to the contrary. 2. If the Person be not imposed upon, by want of a full, and true understanding of the thing so undertaken. Now both these conditions did concur in our blessed Saviour. 1<hi>st.</hi> He had power to lay down his Life, and he had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take it up againe. 2, It would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane to think that the Son of God did not well understand what he did, when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the work of Mans Redemptiom. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no such sponsion can be made with a brute Creature.</hi> Here he seemes to reflect upon the <hi>Iewish Sacrifices:</hi> But 1<hi>st.</hi> He should have

I do not here Dispute whether God might not have pardoned Sin some other way, than that which he did make use of, but considering him as a just Judge, and governour of the World, exerciseing an Vniversal, wise, and just providence therein, it was necessary, that Sin should not go unpunished.</p>

            <p n="3">3.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54216:49"/>
as to Mediators,</hi> &amp;c. But now Christianity teaches the Doctrine of the one, only true God, without these vicious mixtures of our Addresses to any other intermediate beings, <hi>So that,</hi> he says, <hi>the Opinion of the necessity of a Mediator was the foundation of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Opinion of the necessity of a Mediator be well grounded, then it adds strength to the reasonableness of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Mediation, neither will it be any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to it, that it was the occasion of the Heathen Idolatry, if perhaps is was so, for the same may be urg'd against the opinion or belief of a God, that it was the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Superstition and Idolatry in the World, for if there had been no belief of a God, there could not well not have been any Idolatry.</p>
            <p>But if this Opinion of the Heathens was not well grounded, it is no prejudice to our Saviours Mediation, because it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it: Tho' 'tis probable, that God did occasion, or suffer that Opinion so early to prevail in the World, foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it might afterwards be made u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of, to facilitate the belief of the Christian Religion in this particular; but I would not have any conclude from hence, that I found the mediation of Christ only upon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54216:50"/>
prudential considerations, that I utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own, nor do I think that any such odious inference can, in strictness of reason, be drawn from the former assertion.</p>
            <p>I shall only further take notice of one odd piece of reasoning <hi>P.</hi> 93. <hi>That there is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosum honestum hid in all our Souls, is plain from the Epicurean Deists themselves, for they labour to have their vices imputed rather to a superiority of their reason above that of others, than to a servitude of their reason to their passions, which shows that Vice is naturally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed a base and low thing.</hi> How the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion follows from the premises, I do not well see; that which seems more obvious to observe from hence, is, that the Epicurean Deists had a mind rather to be counted Knaves then Fooles, or that they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to mitigate their Vices by ascribing them to a very preternatural cause, <hi>viz.</hi> The Superiority of their reasons above that of other Men.</p>
            <p>There are some few Notes more upon this Subject, but I am afraid the Reader will think I have already insisted too long upon things too inconsiderable. And is not this now a Scheme of Religion worthy of an <hi>Immortal Deist</hi>? Who would not from hence be apt to think, that these Men could write as good a Moral as the Gospel?
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54216:50"/>
what less glorious Title than that of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> becomes such profound reasoning, as this? But what I have here offer'd, I hope, may be at least a <hi>Responsum ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>; If I may so speak, that is, such as tho' not the best, and most perfect in it self, yet a sufficient Answer to him, against whom I write. And I hope it will be no arrogance, or selfe conceit in me to say, that probably my defence of our common Christianity had been more strong, and Nervous, if the opposition had been more considerable.</p>

there are indeed some of these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who hold the materiality of the Soul, and that it dyes with the Body, but is again Created, or reproduc'd at last, by the power of God, and thus in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect may be said to be Immortal; I know not whether this Opinion has not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some encouragement by a piece of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation in Mr. <hi>Lock's Essayes,</hi> pa. 270. which might give occasion to others, to carry the notion further, and to worse purpose than he ever design'd it; for this Argument has been made use of to prove the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriality even of God himself. <hi>Orac:</hi> Of Reason, <hi>pa.</hi> 188.

Of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's thinking,</hi> seemes to have a bad influence upon some other parts of his better reason<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings; for if <hi>matter may think,</hi> it will take away the <hi>certainty</hi> of an immaterial substance in Man; as that great, and excellent Prelate, the Bp. of <hi>Worcester</hi> has sufficiently prov'd.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> tells us, <hi>Pa.</hi> 270, <hi>That it is impossible for us, by the contemplation of our Ideas, without Revelation, to discover, whether omnipotence has given to matter fitly dispos'd, a power of perceiving, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or else joyn'd, and fixt to matter, so dispos'd a thinking immaterial substance; it being equally easy, in respect of our notions, to conceive, that God can, if he pleases, superad to our Idea of matter a faculty of thinking, as that be should add to it another substance with a faculty of thinking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I Answer.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is no derogating from Divine om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, to say, that God cannot doe any thing in a subject contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it selfe; thus if matter be in its own nature incapable of thinking 'tis no lessening of Divine power, to say that God cannot make it, it still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter, to think; now that matter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think, is evident not only from the Idea we have of it, but from all that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of reason that results from thence, that is and from all those absurdities, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences that would follow from such a supposal.</item>
               <item>2. It is not very Philosophicall to have
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54216:52"/>
such frequent recourse to the Divine om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, and to argue from the utmost extent of possibility, for this would take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a great measure, all our present grounds, of certainty, and by degrees lead us to the very borders of <hi>Scepticisme,</hi> would any one believe <hi>Epicurius's</hi> opinion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the originall of the World the sooner, because we cannot prove, that it implyes any Logicall contradiction, that the fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous concourse of atomes might possibly at last hit upon such a regular frame of a World, as we now behold? Tho' I believe the case here before us, <hi>viz.</hi> That of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thinking, is much fuller of absurdity, and contradiction.</item>
               <item>3. Whereas he says, in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irst Edition, <hi>tis Equally easy to conceive, that God can, if he pleases, superad,</hi> &amp;c. I fin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it thus quoted by the Bp. of <hi>worcester,</hi> I suppose out of his latter Editions, <hi>in respect of our notions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it is not much more remote from our comprehension, to conceive that God can, if he pleases.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Equally easie to conceive, and not much more remote from our comprehension to conceive,</hi> are expressions, that do not altogether signify the same thing, so that this learned Author seemes somewhat to waver in his Opinion as to this particular.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But then what difficulty is there, in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing a thinking substance joyned to an
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54216:52"/>
unthinking one, and the thinking one to perform those operations, which the other could not? Is it equally easy, or not much more remote from our comprehensions to conceive, how we may add to a Fool or Ideot the power or faculty of Wisdom, as to conceive how we may joyn to him a wise Guardian to direct him in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Seeing therefore this opinion, of the possibility of matters thinking is a Novel one, the proof hereof must lye upon those, that assert it, and here 'tis not sufficient to say, that they know not, how far the power of matter doth, or may extend, but they must possitively prove, that it extends so far.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> tells us, <hi>Pa.</hi> 270. <hi>That Philosophers ought not Magisterially to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in doubtful Cases, and that there is a certain Modesty, which very well becomes Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy:</hi> This is very true, and yet this Modesty may err in the excess; the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, are in some sense, the most modest Sect of Philosophers, and yet not the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet for that.</p>
            <p>And whereas he saith, that all the <hi>great ends of Morallity, and Religion, are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough secured without Philosophical proofes of the Souls immateriallity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So, what if another should say, that all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54216:53"/>
the ends of Nature are sufficiently secured tho' God always, when we went to sleep, annihilated the Soul, but then when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Body was sufficiently refreshed, or violently press'd upon by some suddain accident, that then God always created it again.</p>
            <p>As for those Arguments which may seem to be drawn from our night Dreams, these, I doubt not, may be solv'd in a way suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Hypothesis, that is, that tho' the <hi>Main body of the Soul,</hi> as it were, be annihilated, yet the Atmossphere or some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot Steams thereof may remain still in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which, like so many Centinels, are left here behind to give some small intimations of what pass'd, during her absence, or state of non-entity: I know no demonstration can be brought against this, and yet I fancy whoever should go about to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophize at this rate, would sooner be laught at, than believed.</p>
            <p>Some things may be asserted, which can neither be fully, and clearly confuted, or shown to be false, nor proved to be really true: And in such things as these, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage always lyes on the side of the de-defendant, thus in that question whether <hi>the Soul doth always think, or no,</hi> either
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54216:53"/>
side may be defended, but neither suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuted.</p>
            <p>But to proceed,</p>
            <p>The 7<hi>th.</hi> is this, <hi>that when we err from the rules of our Duty, we ought to repent, and trust in Gods mercy for pardon.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we ought to do, and it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable we should do so. But then it may be question'd what kind of sorrow it is, that is availeable for the remission of sins, for tho' some kind of Natural sorrow be the necessary result of Conscie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce from the sense of having done some foolish, or wicked action, yet it may be question'd whether this be that ingenuous sorrow, which is both in its own nature, and by Gods appointment so expiatory of sin. And further, how can we have any just ground to trust in God for pardon of sin, even according to the dictates of natural reason, unless to our Repentance we add also, not only a resolution of amendment, but actual Reformation also of our Lives, if time and opportunity doe permit.</p>
            <p>I shall now examine that <hi>Oracular</hi> Syllogisme, which seemes to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as it were, <hi>ex Tripode,</hi> and which, I suppose, he lookes upon as no less, than demonstration.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:54216:54"/>
               <p>That Rule, which is necessary to our future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyness, ought to be made known to all Men.</p>
               <p>But no Rule of reveal'd Religion was, or ever could be made known to all Men.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Therefore no reveal'd Religion is necessary to our future happiness.</hi>
               </q> No instituted Rules, tho' it be in Logick it selfe, can meet with any approbation among some Men, I shall therefore examine this Syllogisme, even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of natural Logick it self. And First, how doth he prove that it is necessary that there should be one single, determinate Rule for the future happiness of all Men? The <hi>Gentiles</hi> had the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>Iews</hi> the Law of <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es,</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> the Gospel, or the Law of Christ for their Rule; I would further ask him, what he meanes by <hi>Our</hi> happiness in the major propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. If we apply it to Christians, it makes the proposition absolutly false; for what necessity is there that the Gospel should be made known to all Men, in order to its being a Rule for future happiness to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians? The Rule of happiness ought to be made known to all, to whom it is a Rule, but no further; but let us see how he proves the Major, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:54216:54"/>Our future happiness depends upon our obeying, or our endeavouring to fulfill the known will of God, but that Rule, which is not generally known, cannot be generally obey'd; therefore that Rule which is not generally known cannot be the Rule of our happiness. Here we may see how the Original sin of the first proposition trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses it selfe to all its Posterity, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the whole Argument a mere blunder, that Rule that is not generally known, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be generally obeyed, but may not the Gospel, tho' it be not known to all, be a Rule to those whom it is known and to whom it is intended, as such, that is, to Christians?</p>
            <p>Those who were born in a Christian state, and who have liv'd for some time in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Christian Religion, cannot but have the Rule of the Gospell made known to 'em.</p>
            <p>But he tells us again, <hi>pa.</hi> 197. That the <hi>natural Religion will suffice for our happiness, because it is the only general means propos'd.</hi> But I cannot yet be satisfy'd with this way of Arguing: And that for these two reasons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Because this would prove, not only that God has not made any other decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his will, than that contain'd in nature, but also that he could not have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54216:55"/>
done any such thing, unless he had made it of as large an extent, as the light of Nature, that is, to all the World. Now let us suppose, that God had actually made such a Revelation of his Will, and in the same manner, as he has done in the Gospel, (and I challenge all the Deists in the World to prove the impossibility of such a thing) yet the argument would lie as strong against the thing then, as it doth now: So that this argument proves too much and by consequence nothing at all to the purpose.</item>
               <item>2. I have often heard it asserted by this Gentleman, but never yet any solid reason given, why the want of an universal reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Gospel to all the World, should make it of less force, or obligation, where it is. Is it the less day with us, because it is at the same time Night in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tber Places? Pa. 198. <hi>The several lustrations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations formerly practised in the World were but symbolicall, and refer'd to our sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and repentance: That is the true and only expiation for Sin, and is so agreed, upon by all Men, in all Ages, and of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions.</hi>

            <p>The original of Sacrifices is variously disputed by Men of several Opinions, but
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54216:55"/>
according to the Deists Principles, they can only be founded in nature, because they do not suppose any positive Revelation of Gods will made afterwards to mankind. But now if all Sacrifices were only Symbolical of Repentance, I do not know why Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should go so far about, as to enjoyn Sacrifices at all, why should not Nature have enjoyned Repentance only, without any such Sacrifices, as have no Intrinsick prevalency for the pardon of sin?</p>
            <p>But how comes he, so much like an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to determine that <hi>Repentance has been so agreed upon by all Men, in all Ages, and of all Religions.</hi> Whereas the contrary is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true, that no company of Men of all Ages and of all Religions ever agreed, that Repentance was the only expiation of sin, in opposition to, or seperation from othe<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Pa.</hi> 199. <hi>If one Religion was once known to be true, Mankind would all agree in it, otherwise those marks of truth in it were not visible, which are necessary to draw an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal consent.</hi> But a reveal'd Religion may have sufficient marks of truth in it, so as to be able to satisfie any rational enquiry, and yet not be able to draw an universal consent, lust, passions, prejudices, and false Opinions may sometimes hinder ttuth from

            <p>
               <hi>Pa.</hi> 202, <hi>I have already endeavour'd to prove, that it is not necessary that God should reveal more, and therefore till that point be determined, I humbly doubt, and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend my belief.</hi> And I have already told him that the controversie doth not depend upon that point, but upon this, whether God hath actualy reveal'd any more, than what he first made known by the light of Nature. It is not for him to prescribe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to God, or to tell him what is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, what not.</p>
            <p>Another Objection he says may be this, <hi>that there is no foundation in natural Religion, for a vertuous Life, or at least not so great, as in a reveal'd Religion, where Rewards and Punishments are propos'd,</hi> If he had urg'd it thus, where Rewards and Punishments are <hi>more clearly</hi> propos'd, than in the natural Religion, then he had done right to the Objection; and in his answer I do not see how in the least he attempts to prove re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and punishments <hi>as clearly</hi> propos'd in the Natural, as in the Reveal'd Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which yet he ought to have done in order to the giving a full answer to the Objection.</p>

betwixt our condition, and that of the Heathens, for if they liv'd up to the height of Vertue and known Reason, they might (say some Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Christians) be happy in a Future State, we cannot, because a Reveal'd Religion has been discover'd to us more than to them, tho' we believe it not.</hi> This seems to be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Objection.

            </p>
            <p>But let us see what Answer he returns to the Objection, he says, <hi>it supposes a reveald Religion, which is yet to prove.</hi> But here he may consider, that we having been in possession of our reveald Religion so many hundred years, we have very good reason to suppose it to be true, till such times as he can prove the contrary: And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he is one of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Deisme requires more evidence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or things, than they are capable of, or more than the nature of things will admit: Now we have as great assurance of the truth of Christianity, as we can have of any thing of that nature; and as much, as we possibly could have, supposing the thing to be absolutely true. If we require more than this, we then run into Scepticisme, the greatest folly in the World, next to Atheisme.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Deisme is unreasonable, because it pretends to be certain of that, which no Man can be certain of, <hi>viz.</hi> That Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r like Rebells, and Traitors, than fair Enemies. I have hitherto examin'd this Answer to the first part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection mentioned. <hi>pa.</hi> 203. I shall now proceed to the Inference, as he calls it. <hi>pa.</hi> 204. That tho' <hi>a supernatural Religion be dubious, yet it is the safest way to embrace it.</hi> We do not grant Supernatural Religion to be in the least dubious, therefore the consequence is good, and well grounded, that it is more reasonable in it self, and more safe for us to embrace it.</p>
            <p>This, methinks, is no hard matter to prove; one might rather wonder, how in a Christian state we should be put upon the proof of such a thing, as this. For first to imbrace, or comply with such a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Christianity, is no violation of any command, or duty of natural Religion it self, for the utmost efforts that Deisme hitherto has, or perhaps can make, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some little difficulties it urges against the Old or New Testament, not any positive arguments to prove the fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty of either, nay, I am apt to believe, that even natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54216:59"/>
Religion, seriously, and impartially considered and followed, would by easy steps lead a Man to the imbraceing of the Christian</p>
            <p n="2">2. Christianity, and natural Religion have the same generall end, and designe, to promote the honour of God, and the good of Men by Temperance, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Holiness, and then, as to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions contained in the revealed Religion, they are not any vicious mixtures, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterations of the natural, but rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of it to higher degrees of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and perfection: Christianity doth not propound any less noble end, nor makes use of any less effectual meanes than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion doth, but rather advances, and improves both: So that if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be safe in the natural, it is much more so in the revealed Religion, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity has all the advantages of natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and many more.</p>
            <p>Then as to the difficulties that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to accompany the practise of the Christian Religion, <hi>Viz.</hi> A more profound mortification of our lusts, and passions, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d a more exalted degree of holiness, and piety, this certainly is rather an argument of its excellence than any diminution of it, especially considering the great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54216:59"/>
that the reveald Religion affords us to performe that Obedience, which it requires of us, and the greatness of the reward that attends the practise of it.</p>
            <p>So that if reveal'd Religion be false, it can no ways prejudice the designs of the Natural, but if it be true, as certainly it is, then the mere belief of a Natural Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be of fatal consequence to those, who have enjoy'd the glad tidings of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But then <hi>Pa.</hi> 204. he says, <hi>I cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace what comes not within the compass of my knowledge.</hi> But in Order to our embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a thing it is not necessary, that it should so come within the compas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of our knowledge, as that we should fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the Modes, and circumstances of it, thus we may embrace the Misterys of our faith, tho' they do not thus come within the compass of our knowledge, and if we must b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lieve nothing but what we thus comprehend, as to the Modes and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the thing, then we must in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to this principle, reject the principal Articles even of Natural Religion also.</p>
            <p>But he proceeds, <hi>And if I cannot believe, 'tis a sign the Evidence is not strong enough to make me.</hi> But our not believing is not always a signe that the Evidence is too
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54216:60"/>
weak, but that our passions, and prejudices are too strong: Evidences in matters of Religion do not work, as Mathematical ones doe, not force assent, but suppose some previous dispositions of the Subject, upon which their efficacy many times de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: 'Tis sufficient, if the evidence be such, as may convince a rational and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Person, if Men will be perverse and and Sceptical, I know no remedy but they must remain so still, <hi>pertinaciae remedium non posuit Deus:</hi> not in the common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Methods of his Providence.</p>
            <p>He proceeds next to answer two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Sir <hi>Charles Woosley's,</hi> but I must Beg leave to tell him, that it it not his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines to answer Arguments, unless they be such upon which the Issue and success of our cause depends. And here, 1 We assert the truth of the History of the Gospel, as to matter of fact. 2. This suppos'd, we say it certainly proves the Divinity of the Doctrine, and a Supernatural Revelation contain'd therein. Here he must prove the falseness of the one, and the in-consequence of the other; and what ever he doth less, than this, it is altogether nothing to his purpose, no ways tends to make good his cause: Tho' I do not say that he has An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered Sir <hi>Charles</hi> his Arguments, I think he
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54216:60"/>
has not, but suppose he had, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> never design'd the whole cause should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon these two, he might urge 'em as further confirmations of the thing he was then about, but he did not lay the whole stress of the cause upon 'em.</p>
            <p>I shall make some short remarks upon his Answer to the 2<hi>d.</hi> Argument. <hi>Pa.</hi> 206. The Argument is this. <hi>Propitiation for our Offences must be supernaturally discovered, or else we can come upon no certain terms of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with God.</hi> In answer to this he tells us, <hi>that all the World, who have agreed upon the fault, agreed upon the compensation,</hi> viz. <hi>Sorrow and true Repentance, and reason dict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes this without revelation.</hi> I wonder why he should say that all the World is agreed upon this point, when all the Christian World dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>om him in it, that is, tho' they grant, that Sorrow for sin, and Repenance are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary conditions in order to our being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to God, yet they do not exclude but necessarily include the satisfaction of Christ. And whereas he says, that Reason dictates this without Revelation, I answer, that tho' Reason may dictate a natural propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inclination in God to pardon, and forgiveness, yet we cannot come to God upon such certain terms of acceptation, as we may do upon the assurance we have
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54216:61"/>
by Divine Revelation, and that for these two reasons. 1. Guilt is naturally full of fears, and jealousies; but Natural Religion is not so fully suited to answer, and take away all these, as Christianity is; as might easily be made appear. 2. Natural reason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so fully assure us of the truth, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our Repentance, as it doth or may convince us of the heinousness of our many sins, and repeated provocations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and I think Natural Religion doth not dictate Sorrow, and Repentance for sin any further a means of reconciliation with God, than as it is sincere.</p>
            <p>But he tells us now, <hi>that more in all Ages ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> agreed that Lustrations and Sacrifices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance were nothing,</hi> &amp;c. Before he had said, <hi>that all in all Ages were agreed,</hi> &amp;c. Now only more were so.</p>
            <p>But it will be hard here rightly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the number of Voices and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it may go against him here too, since there is scarce any whole Nation in the Heathen World, without Sacrifices and Lustrations (by Lustrations I mean what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is outward, and Ceremonial) or if there be, tis probable they are without Repentance too.</p>
            <p>But he sayes, that bare <hi>Repentance is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54216:61"/>
an Infinite Being, is what our Adversarys deny, and therefore point us to an Infinite Sacrifice for sin,</hi> viz. <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>; But we do not point to any other Sacrifice, or propitiation for sin, than what God himself has pointed them to, and that with such clearness, and evidence as to matter of fact, as is beyond the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of their ever proving the contrary: and here will return the force of that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Which like a dead weight, hung about the neck of Deisme, will at last <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ink it, <hi>viz.</hi> The necessity they lye under of proving the History of the Gospel, and the Doctrine therein contain'd, to be false.</p>
            <p>I would willingly assert the necessity of Christs satisfaction, as far as possible, only not to introduce a fatality into the Divine nature, or to destroy the liberty of God's acting herein: Therefore I do not well understand what Mr. <hi>Norris</hi> meanes, when he tells us <hi>pa.</hi> 4. <hi>Of his Reason, and Faith that the necessity of Christ's satisfaction ought to be grounded on the Essential order, and justice of God.</hi> Was Christ's coming into the World made necessary by any other es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential order, or justice of God, different from his own free good will, and love to Mankind: That Sin should not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punish'd was highly agreeable both to the wisdom, and justice of God, but yet we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54216:62"/>
should be carefull not to entertain any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions herein, which may seem to lessen the riches, and freeness of Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in sending his Son into the World for Mans Redemption.</p>
            <p>And when we have asserted the truth of Christs satisfaction in offering himself a sacrifice for Sin, doth it any way derogate from the glory of God, or rather is it not highly agreeable to his <hi>manifold wisdom: Ephe.</hi> 3. 10. Thereby also to accomplish some other subordinate ends of Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, such as were yet truly worthy of God to propound, and not unworthy of Christ to undertake.</p>
            <p>But he tells us <hi>pa.</hi> 207. <hi>That till all, who profess Christianity agree, whether Christ be a propitiation, or no, I need not goe about a further confutation of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this seemes rather a slight way of shuffling off, than Answering the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but is it indeed a sufficient Answer to any Doctrinal point, to say that all who profess the same Religion are not agreed in that particular? I may then tell this Gentleman, who asserts Repentance only a sufficient propitiation for Sin against God, that till all who profess Deisme, agree in this particular, I need not go about any

            <p>I shall here, because of the affinity of the subject to this in hand, briefly examine some particulars, in the Translators preface to <hi>Hierocles,</hi> upon the Golden Verses of the <hi>Pythagoreans.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54216:64"/>
the thing reqnired, the Heathens might be able by the light of Nature to distinguish betwixt good and, evill, tho' their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings did not fully come up to the height of Christianity.</p>
            <p>I do not asserts he says, that the <hi>Law of Nature was Engraven upon the hearts of Men in as faire Characters, as upon the two Tables of Stone, for then there would have been little, or no use of Revelation.</hi> Here seems to be some little obscurity, both in the proposition, he layes down, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he makes from it, I shall briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine both,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> It seemes as reasonable to believe, that the Law of Nature was Engraven <hi>At first</hi> in as fair Characters upon the minds of Men, as it was afterwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ds upon the two Tables of Stone (I do not mean in any gross sense) that is, Natural Duties might be as well known to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice by the light of Nature, as they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the <hi>Iews</hi> by the Promulgation of the Law, if the Law of Nature, in process of time, was so defac'd, that it could not be so easily Read, this was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the vicious principles, and practises, to the false opinions, and wicked Lives of Men afterwards. 2<hi>ly.</hi> As to the inference, <hi>For then there would have been little, or no
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54216:64"/>
use of Revelation.</hi> This may refer either to the Revelation of the Law, or of the Gospell, to that of <hi>Moses,</hi> or that of <hi>Christ.</hi> If it refer to that of <hi>Moses,</hi> yet the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Law by him might be of great use, by seting out, as it were a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Edition of it upon Tables of Stone, when it was so miserably defaced before upon the minds of Men.</p>
            <p>If it refer to the Gospell, that also might be of very great use, notwithstanding all the clearest Revelations that were made either by the Law of Nature, or by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> because the Revelation of the Gospell contains in it something, that was never designed to be made known, at least, so fully, by either: And he will not, I suppose, say, that the method of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, now revealed in the Gospel is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Law of Nature, tho' it had been writ in as fair Char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cters, as that of the two Tables of Stone; nor can he say, that the Law of Nature fully, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Imprinted upon the minds of Men, would render any further Revelation (particularly that of the Gospel) use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
            <p>But yet he says, <hi>that in the Writings of the Heathens is contain'd the whole Moral Law, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54216:65"/>
that uot only in the integral parts, but in its utmost intention, nor is there one Precept of Christianity so exalted, and Heroical, but may be paralell'd in an Heathen: No Man can deny this, he says, who has read the Morals of</hi> Plutarch, Seneca, Epictetus, Cicero, <hi>to these he also adds</hi> Juvenal <hi>and</hi> Persius.</p>
            <p>I am not in the least willing to lessen the great excellencys that some of the Heathens have attain'd to, but yet I k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ow no reason, why they should be equall'd with the Christians. As for those Moralists and Poets he mentions, 'tis observable that all of 'em, except <hi>Cicero</hi> liv'd after the time of our Saviour, and the promulgation of the Gospel, and it is certain that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion had very much improv'd the Morals of the Heathen world at that time, and that they owe a great deal of that light, which appears in their writings, to the Sun of Rightousness, tho' they were not so ingenious, as to acknowledge it. So that there can be no necessary Argument drawn from these, to prove that the Heathens, purely as such, can vie with Christians in this particular. What was said of <hi>Seneca,</hi> may in some measure be said of the rest, <hi>si Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianus Paganice, Si Paganus, Christiane Scripsit.</hi>

                  <p>Or if sometimes a more then ordinary Heroick Precept dropt, as it were, from a Pagan penn, yet this will not be sufficient to equal Natural Religion with Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is a constant, uniform, uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Series, and Constellation, as it were, of Divine Precepts: One Excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is not enough to form an institution, especially if we consider, that the influence thereof commonly reach'd no further than

the particular Sect, by which it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, and many times not so far neither, and then the greater quantity of common rubbish, and perhaps vicious mixtures did quite sully the beauty of the celebrated Maxime, and render the influence of it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ineffectual.</p>

He might as well have gone on, and prefer'd this definition of <hi>Aristotle</hi> above any thing that was ever said, either by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or his Apostles, upon this Subject. Christ in his Sermon on the Mount, if he had a mind to have come up to the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Altitudes, should have given no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the blessedness of such, and such Persons but only because they were such, that is Vertuous. <hi>Blessed are the merciful</hi> because they are merciful, &amp;c. But our Saviour was pleas'd rather to make use of this more humble way, and more accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the State of Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> To place the reason of the happiness in the reward.</p>

            <p>Since therefore Christianity consists of these two principal parts, Mistery and Morality, and both excellent, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I think, they ought not to be oppos'd to, or unseasonably compar'd with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the Theory, and practice of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion mutually supporting, and defending each other. Thus that great and Learned Man, the Reverend Bishop of <hi>Worcester. pa.</hi> 57. Of his Preface, <hi>To his Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity, the principles of Natural Religion, are those that comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I Would not here be thought to take pleasure in finding fault. But this lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Author himselfe has taught me in Dr. <hi>Burnetts,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whiston's</hi> Case, that 'its possible for one to differ from another in some particulars without any lessening of their learning, without any Reflection upon their Persons, or without any disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their performances. I perhaps might
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54216:70"/>
speak as great things in commendation of his Book as he doth of theirs, but it doth not stand in need of the approbation of one of so mean a Character, yet I hope I may without offence make use of that modest liberty, which he takes in the like case.</p>
            <p>Some are only for naturall Religion, not granting any to be reveal'd; others are all for reveal'd Religion, not granting any, in a strict and proper sense, to be Naturall; and I wish that some ill minded Men be not apt from hence (occasion being thus given by dashing these assertions one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another) to conclude, that there is no such thing, as any religion at all. But I think the heat of opposing Deisme proceeds too far, when Men in defence of the reveal'd Religion, deny the natural, for the granting of the one, is so far from being any prejudice to the other, that those two seem rather mutually to support, and defend each other.</p>
            <p>This learned Author in the place above cited tells us, <hi>that the common Rules of Morality, which we generally call Natural Religion, were at first reveal'd by God, and tis very odd he says to think how such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions as these, Parents are to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I do not here sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the simple Ideas of Parents, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be inscrib'd by God, and yet the truth of those proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be truly said to be so, but I shall refer the Reader to what I have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther said upon this particular, in Answer to Mr. <hi>Lock.</hi>

            <p>As for Dr. <hi>Nicholls</hi> his Argument drawn from the poor <hi>honest Indian,</hi> I think is so far good as to prove, that he di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of honesty, and fidelity by any such profound ratiocination, to which some Men would ascribe the Original of all those moral duties. But whether he came to 'em by Tradition, or Instruction from his Father may be justly question'd, because they who have liv'd long and conversed much with those <hi>Indians,</hi> do find that it comes as little into the Parents minds to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their Children in the principles of morality, as it does come into the Children's to make any diligent enquiry into the nature of it themselves.

But he says, <hi>Pa.</hi> 37. <hi>If Morality was inscrib'd on Mens hearts, Parents might with as muh wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom pretend to teach their Children to eat, and drink, to love their Children,</hi> &amp;c. So that it seems, there is such a Natural Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or instinct for <hi>Parents to love their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that they cannot but do it.</hi> But why is not the Duty reciprocal? Why may not Children be, in the same way, bound to honour their Parents, as Parents to love their Children? and yet he says, <hi>Pa.</hi> 72. <hi>That among the ancient Heathens it was a common thing to throw their Children when born into the next ditch, they met with.</hi> No great Argument of such a Natural Love and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards 'em, as they could not but show and exercise: <hi>Pa.</hi> 33, he tells us, 'tis odd to think, that these <hi>Propositions should come into the minds of Men by such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable way, as that of Inscription,</hi> and yet he says <hi>Pa.</hi> 92. <hi>That Gods permission

of Vice is no sign of his liking it, he having otherwise declar'd his will, by giving to all Men a Law of Vertue.</hi> This cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the traditionary Law, because that has not, by some defect or other, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all Men.</p>

               </gap>tained, we ought not to look for another: And tho' tis true, that the Natural Law is agreeable to the dictates of reason it self, when come to perfect maturity, yet if this had been all the Apostle designed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press; I am apt to believe, he would not have thus worded it, by being <hi>written in their hearts</hi>; for by thus doing, he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most inevitably, and invincibly confirm Men in that false opinion (if it be one) which was then more generally received in the World. Nor can any argument be drawn from the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in the following part of the Verse, in prejudice of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Natural inscription. Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> here tells us that these <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I shall now see how difficult it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him to himself in other places, <hi>pa.</hi> 5. There speaking of the belief of a Deity he tells us, <hi>Consentanea uti<expan>

            <p>I shall now briefly examine the reasons he gives of his opinion; if, says he, the Law of Nature, be writ by the finger of God upon the hearts of Men <hi>à primo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu</hi> then it must be <hi>either to direct us to good, or to deter us from evil,</hi> but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not serve for either of these: Not the first, <hi>nam ubi omnia sunt turbata</hi> &amp;c. Where all things are disturb'd, and out of order by reason of the tenderness, and weakness of Age, altogether unfit for prudence, there the Voice of the Law cannot be heard. But will he argue barely from the Laws not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard, that therefore there is none? We commonly say, that in war the Laws are silent, or howsoever cannot be heard
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54216:76"/>
and yet they are Laws even there too: If he supposes us in the state of Infancy, befor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s know neither? If he supposes us in the State of juvenility, tho' our passions be strong, and turbulent, yet methinks, there should be more need at such a time, more especially, of a Law to direct us.</p>
            <p>Nor, 2<hi>dly,</hi> Says he, <hi>can it deter us from evil,</hi> because there is no actual sin in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before the use of Reason, but would it be in vain to have this Law imprinted upon the minds of Children, because they cannot yet make use of it? May not the the Soul of a Child properly be call'd a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul, tho' as yet it cannot form a Syllogism? may there not be natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and dispositions to truth, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness. Some <hi>semina vitae moralis,</hi> tho' these do not show themselves until such prefixt times, as Providence and the nature of things have appointed for 'em? And till this be prov'd either abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is an easy way of confuting those, who differ from us, to tell 'em, as it is an usual custom now a days, that they have no distinct Idea, or clear perception of what they say. But a greater degree of Modesty might very well become a greater Man than himself.</p>
            <p>It is very strange, that God, who at first created Man after his own Image, that he should not make, as it were, one actual stroke either of truth, or holyness upon his Soul, wherein if in any thing, he might much more especially resemble his Creator. So likewise in his new Creation, or spiritual regeneration, which is generally I think, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be begun in Baptism, that he should do nothing by way of actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of grace, and strength, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle.</p>
            <p>Here I beg the Readers Pardon, If I so far digress, as briefly to examine, what the Reverend Author of the Catechetical Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures has laid down in his 70<hi>th. Pa. Vol.</hi> 1<hi>st.</hi> Relating hereunto. <hi>All, who are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, either in the sense of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of the Catechism, are not thus actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Regenerated.</hi> Here the question is not to what degree they are regenerated in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54216:78"/>
but whether they be really Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or no. No one can here imagine, that Children should be so Regenerate in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, as that they should be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the Offices, and Duties of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as adult Persons doe.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Sence of Scripture</hi> he says, it is, <hi>plain, that every one that beares the relation of a Child of God, is not dutifull to his Father which is in Heaven</hi>: No one ever doubted this: But will it thence follow, that even such an one was not once a true Child of God, and regenerated in Baptism; may not Men put themselves out of that state of Salvation, wherein once they were, by their gross and willfull Sins? But then further, every degree of Undutifulnes is not inconsistent with a Regenerate state; indeed upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>very commission of sin, we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to God by repentance, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for the time to come, yet every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sin, doth not put a true Child of God into a state of damnation:</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>meaning of a child of God in the Catechisme. it is plain, that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such, as are renew'd in the spirit of their minds, and imitate God, that are here to be understood, for every one that is Catechised is requir'd to answer, that in his Baptisme
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54216:78"/>
he was made a Child of God, whereas many Catechumens are not y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t renewed and really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</hi> To this I Answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> That these two expressions, <hi>of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> renewed in their minds, and <hi>imitating of God</hi> are not here well joyned together, because Children may be so renewed in their Spirits as to be really regenerated, and yet not to be in a condition of actually imitating of God. 2. Catechumens are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed required to Answer so; neither doth our Church herein require 'em to tell a lye for so they were made the Children of God, and that by true and reall regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (I still insist upon that Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Church asserts it) tho' our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend, and learned Author doth suppose, that many Catechumens were never yet actually renewed in the Spirit of their minds, or regenerated, and <hi>many never will be</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Which makes Baptisme a more insignificant thing, than either Scripture, or the Church of <hi>England</hi> ever design'd to make it. But why may not the Catechumen truly say, that in Baptism he was made a Child of God, more than by a mere Covenant-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>viz.</hi> By the laver of Regeneration <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. and why may we not charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and truly too suppose the Catechumen by the blessing of God upon a Christian
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54216:79"/>
education, still to have the seed of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal grace remaining in him, which we firmly believe God at first bestowed upon him? for our Church tells us, that Infants dying before the commission of sin, are certainly saved, and yet this we know, that nothing impure, or unholy can enter into that state: But he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds.</p>
            <p>So <hi>that a Child of God by Spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and God-like imitation express rather a duty what every one ought to be, than,</hi> &amp;c. By God-like imitation, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he meanes a pious imitation of God, tho' I do not know, whether that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion will bear it, or no:</p>
            <p>But then let us apply what he here says to the Office of Baptism, and see what sense it will make, when we Pray that the <hi>Child then comeing to Christs holy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism may receive remission of his Sins by Spirituall regeneration</hi>; this is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of any thing then actually to be received at Baptism, but at a certain cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical moment of Conversion some Years after, if perhaps such a thing ever happen at all; and whereas in the last prayer of that Office it is said, <hi>We yeild The hearty thanks most mercifull Father, that it hath pleased thee to Regenerate this Infant with
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54216:79"/>
thy holy Spirit</hi>; This must be understood so, as that he is only at present put into a capacity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being Regenerated hereafter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But he that thus explains the Catechism must at the same time destroy the Office of Baptism, which is of equall Authority with the other, but the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not inconsistent with it self, if Men do not come with prejudice, and prepossession to the explication of it: And tho' he tells us, <hi>Pa.</hi> 60. <hi>That this matter was rightly stated by one thus,</hi> that is in a way suitable to his own opinion, yet I believe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon examination, neither his Authority, nor his reasons would be found of any great force.</p>
            <p>I shall only further take notice of one questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Answer in the Catechism. <hi>Dost thou not think, that thou art bound to bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Reverend Dr. doth not take the least notice of this part of that Answer in his expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, so that I do not certainly know what his particular sentiments are herein.</p>
            <p>It is to on purpose to tell us, that it is not easily conceiveable how Children can be regenerate in Baptism, since the Scripture doth warrant it, and the Church affirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>But to return from this digression.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He urges further, <hi>cuj tandem bono indulge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur nobis illa naturalis lex,</hi> &amp;c. Is it that there might be some previous dispositions in the Soul by degrees to dispose it to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obedience to its precepts? Let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this for once, and see what Answer he returns unto it. He tells us, that these previous dispositions to virtue are things
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54216:80"/>
altogether as unintelligible as <hi>Aristotle's</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial forms, which lye hid, no body knows how, in the bosom of the matter, till at last they show themselves in their proper shapes: But here he seemes again, <hi>Eâdem Chord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o these Natural principles do just the same, in reference to the Soul. This indeed is evident affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but I see little of proof in it. There are indeed real difficulties, and absurditys urg'd against <hi>substantial forms</hi>; but I know none against these Natural notions in the sence before asserted: All that seems to be materially objected against this natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, is, that there is, they say, no need of it in order, either to the knowledge of truth, or obligation to duty, these, they say, may be accounted for other ways: But supposing this for once to be true, but not granting it to be so, this is no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against what is here asserted, <hi>viz,</hi> Natural Inscription; for what if God should
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54216:81"/>
afford us more ways in order to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the knowledge of truth, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then we fancy to be absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, have we any reason to blame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for it? But he tells us <hi>Pa.</hi> 336. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Soul doth make certain A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisms, or generall Rules, for the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humane Life, <hi>Post maturam tandem experientiam:</hi> After mature experience.

            <p>But I would only ask him, in what place and in what Age it was, that Men thus gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally met to determine, and fix the Rules of right and wrong, by a general consent: For a further answer hereto, I shall refer my Reader to my former discourse <hi>of humane na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is one thing more, wherein this Gentleman seems to affect some kind of peculiarity, tho' I think it is rather in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, than in notion: That the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, especially as to the Dutys of it, are no ways contrary to Natural reason, but highly agreeable thereunto is certainly true, and tends much to the honour, and reputation of Christianity.</p>

God's fore-knowledge of things to come doth not lay any necessity upon the things fore-seen, antecedently to the event, neither will it hence follow, that God's fore-knowledge might have been here frustrated, if things might have fallen out otherwise, because God did also foresee this possibility too, and yet he saw, that notwithstanding they would certainly fall out thus.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now let us apply this to the present case. God fore-saw that the <hi>Antide-luvian</hi> World would be so preverslly wicked, not withstanding all the means he should use in order to their Reformation: He then order'd such a constitution and frame of things, such an harmony betwixt the Natural and Moral World, that Nature it
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54216:87"/>
self should be instrumental for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mens wickedness, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any violation of the Divine mercy and justice, and in a way agreeable to its own Laws: This seems to tend much to the honour of Divine providence, and no ways contrary to any of Gods attributes. Therefore it is no good way of Arguing, that if the Deluge did come to pass by the concurrence of Second Causes, then it would have happen'd, whether the World had been so wicked, or no, because the constitution of such a frame of Nature did suppose the certainty of its being wicked, and yet without laying any necessity at all of its being so.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to his other Opinion, of seeing all things in God. <hi>pa.</hi> 208. <hi>Lat Edit.</hi> But here also there seems to be some kind of uncertainty, or obscurity in stating of the Question, so that his Notions seem not here to lye very cleare in his Head, <hi>pa.</hi> 211. <hi>Deus non potest facere mentem ad cognos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenda opera sua, ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54216:88"/>
of power, wisdom, and goodness; some thing more then this, is intimated thro' the whole series of his Hypothesis: But then tho' we thus, some way or other see God, yet we do not see his Essence, <hi>pa.</hi> 209. <hi>Inferendum non est, mentes videre Essentiam dei, exeo quòd omnia in deo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deant, eo quo diximus modo, quia id quod vident est val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now it is not easily conceiveable, how we can see God, and yet neither see him by his Essence, nor his Atributes.</p>
            <p>And in the same place he says, <hi>praeter quam quòd dicere possimus nos non ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>However if we see all things in God by his exhibiting to us the Ideas that are in himself, how comes he so variously to represent them to several Men?

That God has in himself the Ideas of all things</hi>: This I shall not deny, but yet if I had a mind to set up for new Notions, I might take the hint from Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> pa. 184. <hi>Of Reason and Religion.</hi> And argue thus, the truth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Reason is in God tho' not in that formality, as it is in Man; this gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from one thing to another which is that we properly call reasoning, being rather a defect incident to created capacities; so God in like manner perfectly knows, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all things, but to see, and know 'em
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54216:89"/>
by Ideas, this is an imperfect way of seeing, and knowing things, proper only to Man, and created Intelligences: But now God sees and knows all things by an infinite, more perfect way, than by Ideas, in a way more sutable to the purity, and simplicity of the Divine Nature, so that when we say that God sees, and knows things by Ideas, this is only an humane mode of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by way of accommodation applyed to God: But I shall leave these novell notions, to those who take more pleasure in them.</p>
            <p>But suppose, we grant Ideas in God, it will not thence follow that we come to the knowledge of all things by viewing their Ideas in him.</p>

                  <hi>THAT God is intimately by his presence united to our minds</hi>; that God is present with our Souls, as he is with all things else, is certainly true, but then I hope, he will not hence inferr, or here assert such an union betwixt God and uor Souls, as neither Reason nor Religion will allow.

            <head>I shall now briefly examine the Reasons, upon which he founds his Opinion.</head>
            <p n="1">1. HE Argues from the general <hi>aecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Vniverse, wherein it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that God never does that by difficult ways, which may be done by simple, and easy ones</hi>: But what if we should say, that the other way, and method of humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is as plain, easie, and obvious, either in it self to be done, or for us to apprehend, as that of seeing all things immediatly in God, however I think the former tends as much to the Illustration of the power, wisdom, and providence of God, as the latter doth. But this maxim, that God always acts by the most simple, and easy methods, must be mannag'd with a great deal of prudence and piety, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it may prove of very bad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: We must not fancy to our selves what are the most simple, and easy ways of doing things, and then by virtue of that
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54216:91"/>
maxim. oblige God to act according to our foolish imaginations thus if we should argue, that it is the more easy, and simple way for the Earth to bring forth Fruit, and Herbs, as it did at first, without Cultivation; or that it had been a more easy, and simple way for God to have pardon'd Sin, without send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son into the World to dye for it, would any one think that there is any force in this way of Arguing?</p>
            <p>That God can make known to us all things more immediatly by himself, every one grants; but then the question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those reasons which <hi>Monsieur Malbr,</hi> hath exhibited to us be sufficient to convince any rational, and considerate Man, that this is the method, that God takes in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
            <p>I shall only take notice further of one period of his upon this Subject wherein he shows a great deal of wavering, and uncertainty in his Notion. <hi>pa.</hi> 209.</p>

2. He knows not where to place 'em, whether in God, or in our selves. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>The Second Reason he gives is, because this Hypothesis places the <hi>minds of Men in the greatest depend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Apostle says expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sly, 1 Cor. 1. 30. of this divine Word, <hi>that he is made unto us Wisdom, which is exactly according to our Hypothesis, that we see all things in the ideal World, or divine</hi>

The Apostle there speaks of Christ Jesus, of Christ more especially, as he is made known to us by the Gospel, for he is there said to be made to us Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption, as well as Wisdom, but I suppose he will not say, that we see our Sanctification or Redemption, that is, the ways and methods of these, in the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I have now finish'd those short Remarks upon those two Subjects, <hi>viz. the law of Fashion and innate Notions,</hi> not only in ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> but to some other Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Persons also, who seem to favour his
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54216:97"/>
Opinion in the second particular; and now if any expression herein seems too harsh, or not becoming the Character of such great and learned Men (though I hope there is not) yet if there be any such, I do hereby wholly recall it. I hope we are all pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same general design, <hi>viz.</hi> the search of Truth, and if so, then the detection of any error will but be the promoting of the same common end we all aim at, for my part, I shall think it so, as to my self.</p>
            <p>I would not have Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> think, that pa. 88. I do there in the least insinuate, that he held the materiality of God, or that I went about to draw him into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in he is nothing concern'd. I do freely grant, that he asserts the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality of the divine Essence in the most strict and proper Sense of it. I was once in hopes that he was convinc'd of the <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the Souls Immateriality too, by what he said pa. 5th. of his Answer to some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, added to his reply, to the Learned Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> but what his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion herein is at present, I know not.</p>
            <p>I shall here only propound these two things to Mr. <hi>Locks</hi> serious Consideration, 1. Whether asserting the immateriality of the Soul be not a good Fence or stop against the inlet of that dangerous Opinion of the
