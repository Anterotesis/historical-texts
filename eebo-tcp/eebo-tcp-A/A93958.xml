            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This is clear enough, yea and good enough hitherto, if there were no more in it but ſo.

            <p>In the ſeveral parts of the Text thus opened, we may ſee the full meaning of the whole.

Set both theſe aſide; and hir defenſe is made in a word, if we do but remember what hath been allrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">17</note> delivered in the <hi>Explication</hi> of the Text: to wit, that it is not <hi>the commandments of men,</hi> either <hi>Materially</hi> or <hi>Formally</hi> taken; but the <hi>Opinion</hi> that we have of them, and <hi>the teaching</hi> of them <hi>for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> wherein Superſtition properly conſiſteth. <hi>Materially</hi> firſt. There is no Superſtition either in <hi>wearing</hi> or in <hi>not wearing</hi> a Surplice, in <hi>kneeling</hi> or in <hi>not kneeling</hi> at the Communion, in <hi>croſsing</hi> or in <hi>not croſſing</hi> an infant newly baptized: even as there is no ſuperſtition in <hi>waſhing</hi> or in <hi>not waſhing</hi> the hands before meat.

A man may eat, and do it with a good conſcience: and he may <hi>not eat,</hi> and do that with a good Conſcience too. As in the preſent caſe, at this time it is certain Chriſts diſciples did eat and <hi>waſhed not:</hi> it cannot be doubted, but at ſome time or other they <hi>waſhed</hi> before they ate.

As on the contrary, if any body ſhould refuſe to <hi>weare,</hi> or <hi>kneel,</hi> or <hi>croſſe,</hi> out of an opinion of their <hi>unlawfulnes;</hi> as if thoſe Ceremonies did vitiate the whole act of that worſhip whereunto they are applied: I cannot ſee, but upon the ſame ground, and by reaſon of ſuch his opinion, the <hi>refuſal</hi> of thoſe Ceremonies ſhould be <hi>to him</hi> alſo <hi>Superſtition.</hi> Becauſe a man cannot be of that <hi>opinion,</hi> but he muſt believe this to be <hi>true doctrine,</hi> that ſuch and ſuch Ceremonies are of themſelves <hi>unlawful</hi> to be uſed in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. But the obedient children of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> having no ſuch opinion either of the <hi>neceſsity</hi> or <hi>unlawfulnes</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> but holding them to be (as indeed they are) things in their own nature indifferent: are even therefore free from <hi>Superſtition</hi> in both the kinds aforeſaid: So then in the things commanded taken <hi>materially,</hi> that is to ſay, conſidered <hi>in themſelves</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Churches command, there is no <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition:</hi> becauſe there is nothing concerning them <hi>doctrinally</hi> taught either the one way, or the other.</p>
            <p>Now if we can as well clear theſe things taken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>formally,</hi> that is to ſay, conſidered not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <note place="margin">18.</note> but <hi>as they ſtand commanded</hi> by publick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

of the Church: the whole buſineſſe is done, as to this point. Nor is there in truth any great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in it, if we will but apprehend things aright. For although the very <hi>commanding</hi> them do ſeem to bring with it a kind of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and to lay a tye upon the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> (as that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> implieth both, <hi>you muſt needs be ſubject,</hi> and that <hi>for conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake:)</hi> yet is not that any tye brought upon the <note place="margin">

Even as it is in all Civil Conſtitutions, and humane poſitive Laws whatſoever. And the <hi>Neceſsity</hi> alſo is but an <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diential,</hi> not a <hi>Doctrinal</hi> neceſſity. But the Text requireth a <hi>Doctrinal neceſſity,</hi> to make the thing done a vain and ſuperſtitious worſhip <hi>[Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.]</hi> Which the <hi>Church of England</hi> in preſcribing the aforeſaid Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies hath not done; nor by her own grounds could do.

publick Governours, it is not the <hi>commanding</hi> or <hi>forbidding</hi> of a mutable Ceremony, as for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they ſhall deem it fit, for <hi>order, decency,</hi> or <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities</hi> ſake, or ſuch other like reſpect: but the <hi>commanding</hi> of it with an opinion as if it were of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual neceſſity,</hi> or the <hi>forbidding</hi> it with the like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as if it were <hi>ſimply unlawful,</hi> that maketh the <hi>Conſtitution ſuperſtitious.</hi>

Their guilt herein will yet farther appear, if lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving compariſons, we take a view of ſome of their <hi>doctrines</hi> by themſelves.

There are ſo many Covies of <hi>new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> ſprung up ever and anon, eſpecially in theſe late times of connivence and licentiouſneſs; which by that they are well hatcht, preſently fly abroad the Countrey, and are entertained by ſome or other for as good Divinity, as if they were the undoubted Oracles of the Holy Ghoſt. I dare not affirme it, becauſe I will not put my ſelf to the trouble to prove it, and becauſe I heartily deſire and wiſh I be deceived in it: yet I cannot diſſemble my fear that it is but too true, (by the proportion of what we almoſt daily hear or ſee,) that within little more than this <hi>one twelvemonth</hi> laſt paſt there have been more falſe and <hi>ſuperſtitious doctrines</hi> vented in the <hi>Pulpits</hi> and <hi>Preſses</hi> in England, than have been (in ſo open and daring a manner) in the whole ſpace of <hi>almoſt fourſcore years</hi> before, I mean ſince the firſt of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed memory.

23. Concerning which <hi>Poſitions,</hi> I do here in the face of this Congregation take God to witneſs, who ſhall judge us all at the laſt day, that I do verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and in my conſcience am perſwaded, that all and every of them are the vaine and <hi>ſuperſtitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi> of men, wholy deſtitute of all ſound war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the <hi>Written Word</hi> of God rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and applied: and (till they ſhall be better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) ought to be ſo eſteemed of every man that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to make Gods Holy Word the rule of his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and actions. Many and great are the <hi>miſchiefs</hi> otherwiſe, that come to the Church and people of God, by the <hi>teaching</hi> of theſe and other like <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Poſitions:</hi> As amongſt others theſe <hi>three</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Firſt,</hi> great ſcandal is hereby given to <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, Papiſts, Separatiſts,</hi> and other the enimies of our Religion; eſpecially to the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> who will not onely take occaſion thence to ſpeak evil of us and of <hi>the way of truth and holineſs</hi> which wee profeſs, but will be themſelves alſo the more confirmed in their own wicked errors, by objecting to us, that ſince we left them, we cannot tell where to ſtay. <hi>Secondly,</hi> many ſober and godly men, both Miniſters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who cheerfully ſubmit to <hi>the eſtabliſhed Lawes</hi> and Government, (as they take themſelves by <hi>the Law of God</hi> bound to doe, in things which they believe not to be repugnant to his Word) are by this means unworthily expoſed to contempt and miſcenſure, as if they were <hi>time-ſervers,</hi> or inclined to <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Superſtition</hi> at the leaſt. But if they ſhall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:153300:18"/>
farther endeavour in their Sermons or otherwiſe, to ſhew their juſt diſlike, and to hinder the growth, of theſe <hi>unlawful impoſitions,</hi> and to hold the people in their good beliefe by inſtructing them better; they ſhall be ſure to be forthwith branded as <hi>oppoſers of the Goſpel.</hi> As if there were ſuch <hi>a ſpirit of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> annexed to ſome mens <hi>Pulpits,</hi> as ſome have ſaid there is to the <hi>Popes Chaire,</hi> that whatſoever they ſhall deliver thence muſt needs be <hi>Goſpel. Thirdly,</hi> hereby many an honeſt-hearted and well-meaning Chriſtian is wonderfully abuſed: by being miſ-led into <hi>Error, Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience;</hi> by having his conſcience <hi>brought into bondage</hi> in thoſe things, whereunto it was the good pleaſure of God to leave him free; and by being diſpoſed to much <hi>uncharitableneſſe</hi> in judging evil of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hath given him no juſt cauſe ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe and ſundry other <hi>miſchiefs</hi> of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence, too long now to repeat: the <note place="margin">24.</note> thing that I am preſently to affirme, concerning all and every of the <hi>poſitions aforeſaid</hi> and other like them, pertinently to the Text and buſineſs in hand, is this, That whoſoever ſhall <hi>doctrinally</hi> and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively <hi>teath</hi> any of the ſame, doth <hi>ipſo facto</hi> become guilty of the <hi>Superſtition</hi> here condemned by our Saviour, and ſo farre forth ſymbolizeth with the Phariſees in <hi>teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</hi> And I doubt not, but there are in the <hi>Church of England</hi> ſundry learned iudicious and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:153300:19"/>
Divines,</hi> no way ſuſpected of favouring <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery or Popiſh Innovations,</hi> that by Gods help and the advantage of Truth will be ready to maintaine what I now affirme, in a fair Chriſtian and Scholar-like trial, againſt whoſoever are otherwiſe minded, whenſoever by authority they ſhall be thereunto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>I have now finiſhed what I had to ſay from this Scripture by way of <hi>Application.</hi> From the whole <note place="margin">25.</note> premiſſes would ariſe ſundry <hi>Inferences,</hi> as Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and by way of <hi>Uſe.</hi> In the proſecution whereof, had we time for it, I ſhould have occaſion to fall upon ſome things that might be of right good uſe for the ſetling of mens <hi>judgments</hi> and <hi>conſciences</hi> in a way of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi> And truely my aime lay chiefly here, when my thoughts fixt upon this Text. But having enlarged my ſelf ſo far beyond my firſt purpoſe allready, I ſhall onely give you a ſhort touch of each of them: and it may be hereafter (as I ſhall ſee cauſe, and as God ſhall diſpoſe,) I may take ſome other occaſion, here or elſwhere, to enlarge them further.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> ſhould be an <hi>earneſt requeſt</hi> to ſuch of my Brethren, as through inconſideration, zeale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">26.</note> Popery or profaneneſſe, or any other cauſe, have been a little too forward and faulty this way. That they would in the fear of God <hi>review</hi> their own <hi>dictates,</hi> and (all <hi>partiality</hi> and ſelf-ſeeking laid aſide) beſtow a little paines to <hi>examine</hi> throughly the ſoundneſs of thoſe <hi>principles</hi> from which they
<pb facs="tcp:153300:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
draw their <hi>concluſions:</hi> whether they be the very <hi>true word</hi> of God indeed, or but the fanſies and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the wit of man. I know how loathly men are induced to ſuſpect themſelves to be in an Errour: and that it is with our brethren herein as with other men, may ſufficiently appeare in this, that few of them will ſo much as beſtow the reading of thoſe books, that might give them ſatisfaction. But (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) better <hi>try your own work</hi> your ſelves, and if it prove but <hi>hay</hi> or <hi>ſtubble</hi> burn it your ſelves, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging your errour and retracting it; that you may build better: than let it lye on ſtill, till a ſorer fire catch it. Better for any of us all, whether in reſpect of our <hi>errours</hi> or <hi>ſins,</hi> to prevent the Lords judging of us, by timely <hi>judging our ſelves,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 31.</note> than to ſlack the time till his judgment overtake us.</p>

The <hi>golden meane</hi> is a hard thing to hit upon almoſt in any thing, without ſome warping toward one of <hi>the extremes,</hi> either on the right hand, or on the left: and without a great deal of wiſdome and care ſeldome ſhall we ſeek to ſhun one <hi>extreme,</hi> and not run a little too farre towards the other, if not quite into it. In all which and ſundry other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, we may ſoon fall into groſs miſtakes and <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> if we do not take the more heed; whilſt we ſuſpect no ſuch thing by our ſelves, but verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all we do is out of pure zeale for Gods Glorie, and the <hi>love</hi> of his truth. We had need of all the <hi>piety,</hi> and <hi>learning,</hi> and <hi>diſcretion,</hi> and <hi>paines,</hi> and <hi>prayers</hi> we have: and all little enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods <hi>bleſſing</hi> too, (ey and our own greater <hi>care</hi> too,) to keep us from running into <hi>Errours,</hi> and from <hi>teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</hi>
