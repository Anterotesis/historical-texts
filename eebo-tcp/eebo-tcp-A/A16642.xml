         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Firſt therfore I wyl ſhew the cauſes

I wyll ſette downe ſome remedies and

of the Peſtilence. The firſt pertayneth
<pb facs="tcp:25153:5"/>
to Diuinitie, the ſeconde to Aſtronomie,
the third and fourth to Phyſick. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that which pertaynes to diuinitie,
our ſinne and wickedneſſe, (the principal
cauſe of al our miſerie and calamitie,) is
one cauſe of this diſeaſe. As may apeare

who among manye other curſes,

ſhould auoyd ſinne, leſt their plagues fal
vpon vs. For their God is our God, and
he hateth ſinne in vs, as he did in them,
and there fore puniſheth it in vs, as hée
did in them. Therefore I ſaye ſinne is a
principal cauſe of the Peſtilence: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God puniſheth not ſo muche thoſe,
whom he taketh therby out of this life:
as thoſe that remaine aliue. For they
that liue, féele the ſmarte of the plague,
when as the other, manye of them, dye
Gods ſeruants, and for this tranſitorie
life, enioy that, which neuer ſhal end. If
oure owne experience doe not teache vs
this, we may perceiue it by the foreſayd
puniſhment of King Dauid, to whom it
had not béene ſo gréeuous to haue dyed
himſelfe, as to léeſe his ſubiectes, in the
multitude whereof, he through a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſdome truſted more than in the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightye
power of God. Therefore God
diminiſhed the number of them by the
Peſtilence: to teache him, and all other
<pb facs="tcp:25153:6"/>
Princes, not to put their truſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of menne, (bicauſe it is his owne
worke to preſerue the ſtate of Realmes,
&amp; to giue victorye in battell:) and alſo to
teache vs, and all men, that ſinne is a
cauſe of the plague, aſwel as of other ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lamities
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> happen vnto men. Although
this cauſe be ſupernaturall, (as ſome
tearme it,) and not properly pertayning
to Phiſicke: yet thoſe Phiſitions are not
to be miſliked, which in reciting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of this ſickneſſe, note this in the firſt
place, as the roote of the reſidue, vppon
the whiche the other do depend, &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
doe followe: the whiche béeing
expelled, the other ſhall not bée percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to our hurte, but ſhall vaniſhe euen
as the ſmoke, when the fire is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Therfore theſe Phiſitions are like
vnto good &amp; faithfull Chirurgians, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
ſéeke the bottome of the wound, and
heale it throughly. But they that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

For they that are preſerued from

ſure, if the corruption of ſinne remaine
within them, that a greater plague wil
folow. For God ſendeth this, and diuers

               <p>THe ſecond cauſe is giuen by Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers,
and is called an euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation:
<pb facs="tcp:25153:7"/>
which they know by the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres,
in the firmament, or circles of Heauen,
and by their coniunctions, oppoſitions,
&amp; other aſpectes of the one to the other.
Of this cauſe I do not thinke it néedfull
here to ſpeake, eſpecially in ſuch maner
as the Aſtronomers doe, who by their
Ethnicall phraſes, and kindes of ſpeach
in their Alminackes and Prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
do ſéeme to fauor or foſter the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie
of the Heathen: who worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
thoſe celeſtiall creatures as Gods.
For they ſpeake of them, either as of
Gods, or (at the leaſt) as of liuing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
indued with reaſon, and béeyng in
great power, and authoritie. Moreouer,
wheras they write their Prognoſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the vſe of the vnlearned, I know
not to what purpoſe they ſet downe the
motions of the planets, with their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of Arte, only known to themſelues.
If the Art be profitable for Phiſicke, let
them kéep it to themſelues, and vſe it in
their practiſes: if it bée profitable for
huſbandrie, let them write that onelye
<pb facs="tcp:25153:7"/>
whiche is according to the capacitie of
huſbandmen: Whiche being done, I
thinke huſbandmen ſhall haue little vſe
of their writings.</p>
               <p>For although huſbandrie did (perhaps)
firſt procéede of the knowledge of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
as diuerſe other trades neceſſary
for the life of man, haue their beginning
of Geometry, and natural Philoſophy,
yet I think huſbandmen, and men of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
faculties, whiche are altogither ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
in theſe Artes, are more ſkilfull
and wiſe, through their daily practiſe, in
the vſe therof, than they themſelues that
are profeſſors of the Artes. Thus much
by the way, by occaſion of the ſeconde

               <head>¶The third Chapter ſheweth the third

               <p>THe thirde cauſe, (whiche more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

corruption of the ayre: whiche beyng
corrupted, is apte to infect mans body.
For euery man that liueth, draweth the
<pb facs="tcp:25153:8"/>
breath which we haue, of the aire round
about vs. If it be ſtinking, venomous,
and corrupt, the body of man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is neare
to it, is in danger of corruption, wherof
oft times is ingendered the Peſtilence.
The aire is corrupt, either generally in
diuers Cities, or Countries: or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
in ſome one place.</p>
               <p>Generally (as Aſtronomers write) by
an euil conſtellation, or by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> filthy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a Comete, cauſed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Particularly, in a fewe houſes, or
ſtréetes, through the ſtinche of chanels,
of filthie dung, of carion, of ſtanding
pudles, and ſtincking waters, of ſéeges,
or ſtinking priuies: of ſheding of mans
bloude, and of deade bodies, not déeply
buried, (which happeneth among Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors:)
of common piſſing places, and
ſuch like. Finally a gret company dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or lying in a ſmal roome, (eſpecially
if thoſe roomes be not very clenly kept,
&amp; perfumed,) do inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der a corrupt aire,
apt to infect thoſe that are in it: whiche
infected perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and their infectious clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,
may infect a whole Citie, and the
<pb facs="tcp:25153:8"/>
Citie may infect the country that reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vnto it, or vnto the which the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
thereof do reſorte. For a veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
aire is like vnto fire, whiche bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that is nighe vnto it: if the matter
be apt to take fire. Wherby it commeth
to paſſe ſomtimes, that as a litle ſparke
conſumeth a whole Town: ſo one houſe
or ſtréete, infecteth the whole Citie and
Country rounde about it: the perſons
I meane of the Citie and Country, that
come within the compaſſe of the infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
aire: if their bodies be apt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
<note place="margin">I ſpeake of the ordinarie vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God, vvhich I vvold alvvaies haue ſo to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, that it is nothing preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> I ſay a venemous aire infecteth

apte to be infected. For if the ayre were
of power to infect all that come wythin

infection, whiche commeth not to paſſe.
For, as fire burneth, but not Iron and

ſo a corrupte aire hath power to infect,
but thoſe bodies onelye, that are apte to

               <head>¶The fourth Chapter ſheweth the

               <p>THE fourth cauſe is the aptneſſe of
mans body, through euill humors
to receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effecte of a venomous aire,
putrifying and corrupting the bodie:
whereof the diſeaſe is ingendered. The
bodie is made apte to be infected by the
abuſe of things not naturall, (as Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
tearme them,) that is to ſaye, by
taking of meate and drinke out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
ſpecially by féeding of many diſhes
at one meale, or by toomuch lack of good
nouriſhing meate, by too much ſléepe, or
watching, by too much laboure or eaſe:
Finally, by too muche anger, griefe of
minde, and feare of the diſeaſe. As all
theſe things are dangerous: ſo the laſte
is ſufficient of it ſelfe to infect the body,

               <p>

the cauſes.</p>
               <p>For, as it is an olde ſaying, ſo euerye
man maye eaſily perceiue it to be true:
<hi>Sublata cauſa, t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>llitur effectus,</hi> when the

not. If the cauſe of warre bée taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
wée ſhall haue peace: ſo if wée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
the cauſe of ſickneſſe, wée ſhall
haue healthe. If fire bée not laide to the
woodde, it cannot burne: ſo, if there bée
nothing that bringeth or cauſeth the
Plague, we cannot be infected. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it ſerueth our tourne very much, to
know the cauſes therof.</p>
               <p>For it is a very true ſaying, <hi>Foelix qui
potuit rerum cognoſcere cauſas,</hi> he is happy
that can vnderſtande the cauſes of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
By vnderſtanding the cauſes of

               <p>Therefore I haue ſette downe the
cauſes of the Plague. Nowe, it folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth,
that I write of the preſeruatiues,
whereby a man may be kept from this
diſeaſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="chapter">
               <head>¶The fift Chapter, wherein is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a preſeruatiue againſt the firſt
cauſe of the Peſtilence.</head>
               <p>IN this part we muſt haue an eie to
the cauſes. For except the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiues
be of force, and alſo contrary, or
(as I may ſaye) enimies to the cauſes:
they cannot preuaile againſt them. For
preſeruatiues are to the cauſes of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as watchmen are to théeues. If the
watchmen be ſtrong ynoughe, and alſo
haue a minde to reſiſt the théeues, they
will kéepe the houſe from robbing: but
if they lack of ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, or if they conſent
vnto the robbers, and let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue their
purpoſe: they rather doe harme than

<pb facs="tcp:25153:10"/>
So the preſeruatiues muſt be ſuche, as
are contrarie to the cauſes of diſeaſes,
and able to reſiſt them, or elſe they can
not kéepe a man from ſickneſſe. The
firſt cauſe of the plague is Sin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is requiſite if poſſibly it might be,
that we did in all points abſtaine from
it. But foraſmuch as the corruption of
our fleſh is ſuche, that we ſinne often
times, and there is no man liuing, that
without Phariſaicall, Papiſticall, and
Phantaſticall arrogancie can ſay, hée is
voide of wickedneſſe: it remaineth, that
with al ſpéed, before the ripeneſſe of our
ſinne ſtir vp Gods wrath againſte vs to
plague vs: it remaineth (I ſay) that we
purge, and cleanſe oure ſelues from all
ſinne and wickedneſſe. Sinnes are ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Publique or Priuate. Publique
offences, or (to ſpeake more properly,)
offences that are committed by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
openly, ſo that they are manifeſt
to the eies of al men, muſt be purged by
Publique aucthoritie: and Priuate, or
ſecret offences, euery priuate man muſt
ſéeke to purge of hymſelfe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Although
<pb facs="tcp:25153:11"/>
I knowe, that of the twoo, publique
offences are more daungerous, as the
which are cauſe of warre, famine, and
peſtilence, of captiuitie, of the ſpoyle of
mens goods, of deſtruction of the people,
and of the ſubuerſion of kingdomes.
Yet, foraſmuche as it perteineth not to
my purpoſe, in this treatiſe, to ſpeake of
theſe offences, I let them paſſe. For as
in many things perteining to Phiſicke,
I referre the richer ſorte to the counſell
of the lerned Phiſitions: ſo in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
I referre them that are in authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to the ſermons, and writings of the
lerned diuines. But as it doth little good
to cut off the toppes of wéedes in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and not to dig vp the roote, bycauſe
moſt commonly they wil come vp thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
than they did before: ſo it is almoſte
a laboure in vaine, to ſhew means how
to purge the wickednes of priuate me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
vnleſſe publique offences bée firſte cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
For as from the root commeth nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
to herbs both good and badde,
whereby they grow and flouriſhe: ſo by
publique offences, the wickedneſſe of
<pb facs="tcp:25153:11"/>
priuate men is encreaſed, &amp; maintained,
or (at the leaſt) ſo hid and couered, that
it cannot be perceyued. Theſe offences,
whiche I call publique, doe annoye the
whole bodie, not without ſome griefe of
the principall members of the common
weale: which being vncured, I perſuade
my ſelfe, that the operation of my poore
medicines, preſcribed vnto the inferior
partes, wil be very ſmall. Therefore, I
wiſhe all them that are in authoritie, to
aſke counſell of God, who ſpeaketh vnto
vs in his word. If they be not ſtudents
of Diuinitie, and therfore miſtruſt their
own iudgement, let them reſort to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,

and prouoke hym to plague vs, or no?</p>
               <p>Let them aſke of them, whether that

further inconuenience: which is not ſo
ſecrete, nor ſo ſmall, but that honeſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>THe third cauſe was ſayde to be the
corruption of the ayre. The preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue
is, to auoyde, as much as may be,
thoſe things aforeſayde, that cauſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
In the which, good héede muſte
be taken of clothes, and alſo of dogges, &amp;
cattes, that haunt infected places. Syr
<hi>Thomas Eliot,</hi> in his caſtle of healthe,
ſayth, It hath béene ſéene, that infected
ſtuffe lying in a coſer faſt ſhutte for the
ſpace of two yeares, and then being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
hath infected thoſe that ſtood nigh it,
who ſoone after died. And he that willeth
to kill al the dogs, (vnleſſe they be tied
vp,) in time of infection, giueth not the
worſt counſel. Not many yeares ſince,
I knew a Glouer in Oxforde, who with
his familie, to the number of ten or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb facs="tcp:25153:17"/>
perſons, died of the Plague: whiche
was ſayde to be brought into the houſe
by a dogge ſkinne that his wife bought,
when the diſeaſe was in the Citie. It is
good therefore, when it is in anye houſe,
well to aire in the Sunne, or at the fire,
the clothes that the infected perſons do
weare, that they lye in, or that are néere
vnto them. For the fire is a good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of euill ayre: it is of force to drawe
the venome thereof vnto it, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
it. So that if the fire be betwéene a
man, and the infected perſon, or place,
it taketh awaye the force of the euyll
ayre.</p>
               <p>Therefore the counſell of Phyſitians
is, to make a fire at all times, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the morning, and euening, in the
houſes, and alſo without in the ſtréetes,
where the diſeaſe reigneth. It is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> famous Phiſitian <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>
was a meane to preſerue the citie, and
countrie of <hi>Athens,</hi> from the daunger of
the Peſtilence, by making greate fiers
in the ſtréetes, and all aboute the towne
by night: at whiche time (bicauſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:25153:17"/>
abſence of the Sunne,) the ayre was
moſt contagious: whereby the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
were deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certain death,
whych they were perſuaded ſhould haue
come among them. I ſay not as ſome ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly

knewe not GOD) thoughte: that
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> preſerued the Cittie: but
that he was a meane to preſerue it, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ordinaunce of God: who as many times
miraculouſly, ſo for the moſt part, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
by ordinarie meanes: who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to herbes, and other his creatures,
vertue to expell diſeaſes: and alſo hathe
giuen vnto men knowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
thereof: whyche he vſeth as
his inſtrumentes, wherewith he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
when, and vppon whome, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him.</p>
               <p>This I write by the way, that when
the vertues of hearbes, and other Gods
creatures are mentioned, we depende
chiefly vpon his prouidence, &amp; alwayes
with the eyes of our faith looke vppon
him, as the chiefe worker of al good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
without whome nothing can take
<pb facs="tcp:25153:18"/>
effect to our commoditie. Wyth thys
minde we maye be bolde to ſéeke to the
Phyſitian, and to vſe ſuche things as
God hath created for our health. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe,
if a man refuſe them in time of
neceſſitie, when the Phiſitian is readye
to miniſter them after this ſort: I take
him to be a tempter of God, or as one
acceſſarie to his owne death. After thys
ſort I counſell al men againſt the thirde
cauſe of the peſtilence, to vſe the fire, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the which it is good to adde perfumes
of Iuniper, Intenſe, &amp; ſuch like: &amp; as the
time of the yere ſerueth, gréen boughes,
ſwéete floures, and hearbes, are to be ſet
and ſtrewed in the houſes, and ſtréetes:
as well where the diſeaſe reigneth not,
as in places infected.</p>
               <p>Finally, it is good to hold in the mouth
and to bite of the Orenge péele, or of the
roote of the herbe called <hi>Angelica.</hi> Here
note by the way, that where I ſaye, or
ſignifie that perſons, or places infected
muſt be auoyded: I counſell not any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whoſe vocation requireth, or the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of the diſeaſed, or charitie bindeth to

be preſent with the infected: I counſell
them not (I ſaye) to abſent themſelues
from them: but rather to preferre the
commaundement of God before theyr
owne ſafegarde, vſing ſuche things as
GOD hath ordeined for the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

life ſhall be nothing the ſhorter.</p>

               <p>I Sayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth cauſe of this diſeaſe
is, the aptneſſe of mans body to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the effect of a corrupt aire: for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
wherof, thoſe things aforeſaid
muſt be auoyded, which ingender euyll
humours, or otherwiſe make the bodie
vnable to expel euill aire.</p>
               <p>The firſte of theſe, is the taking of
meate, and drinke out of meaſure, and
too much lacke of it. Of the former the
riche are in daunger: by the latter the
poore are pinched. But the riche can
finde meanes by purgations to expel the
<pb facs="tcp:25153:19"/>
ſuperfluitie of euill humours: whyche
in time of neceſſitie is verye requiſite.
Howbeit it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſaying, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
purgations, and other ſuch euacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
doe weaken the body, diminiſh the
naturall moyſture that prolongeth life,
and therfore haſten death.</p>
               <p>For auoyding of the which inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
I would ſhew them a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,
if they coulde learne it: and that
is this: That they diminiſhe ſome parte
of their exceſſe, and giue it to their honeſt
neyghbours that can not worke: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to them that labour, whoſe charge is
ſuch, that they are not able to maintayn
their familie.</p>
               <p>This is more healthfull for themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
better for a Common weale, and
more acceptable to GOD. Further
of this matter I néede not to write: For
the meaner ſorte, that laboure truely in

againſt this cauſe, and the former, the

are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tokens, which ſhew that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is infected with the Plague. Firſte, for
the moſt part, there appeareth about the
eare or necke, or vnder the arme holes,
or about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flanke of the infected perſon,
an Apoſthume, or ſwelling, with a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
or Ague: or in ſome other part of the
body, a gréene, blacke, or euill coloured
ſore. This (I ſay) appeareth for the moſt
part, but not alwayes. Therfore, for the
more certainty, the other tokens folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
muſt be conſidered. An other token
is, a greate pricking and ſhooting in the
body, eſpecially in thoſe foreſayd places,
the necke, armeholes, and flankes. The
third is an outragious heate within the
bodie, as if a man were in the fire: &amp; yet
oftentimes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>  outward parts are ſo cold,
that it maketh a man to ſhake, as if he
were in a Feuer. This inward heate is
ioyned with much heauineſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head:
drineſſe of the mouth, &amp; extreme thirſt.
Wherevpon, in ſome followeth a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous
deſire to léepe, ſo that they can
not be kepte waking: otherſome can
<pb facs="tcp:25153:20"/>
not ſléepe, but are out of quiet, &amp; raue as
though they were falne into a Phrenſy,
or are like them that dote. Other ſignes
are, hardneſſe to drawe the breathe, or
muche labour to take winde: whiche in
ſome is ſo ſtraight, that they can ſcarſe
ſpeake. Alſo the breath ſtinking: greate
pain of the head: faintneſſe, ſluggiſhneſſe,
weakeneſſe of the lims: the bodye verye
heauie, &amp; dul: the ſweat ſtinking: the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
beating thicke, ſmall, and déepe: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhe,
&amp; penſiueneſſe of minde: pſain in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
mouth, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtomack: no apetite to meat:
often vomitting, the vomit being bitter
and of diuerſe colours: bitterneſſe, and
blackneſſe, or yellowneſſe, and dryneſſe
of the tongue: the vrine much like vnto
beaſtes ſtale, troubled, thicke, and ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
or at the firſte like cleane water,
then blackiſhe, and at the laſt troubled,
and for the moſte parte, without any
reſidence: chaunging of ſight, ſo that
there commeth ſometimes to the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes
eyes, as it were a yellow coloure,
and ſometimes all that be beholdeth he
thinketh to be gréen: paine of the mouth
<pb facs="tcp:25153:21"/>
or an vnaturall taſte, bitter, ſower, or
ſtinking. Theſe are the principal ſignes
of infection: and yet not certaine tokens
of the Plague. For it may be ſometimes
in a man without any of them: and alſo
ſome of theſe tokens are in manye, that
are not infected with this diſeaſe. Here
it is not impertinent to note, that where
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Plague raigneth, there are ſcarſly any
other diſeaſes beſides, or if there be, they
wil ſhortly after be turned into it. This
is the opinion of learned Phyſitians,
and ſéemeth to agrée with reaſon. For if
euil humors, make a man apt to receiue
infection: it is no maruell that they whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

               <p>HEre is to be noted, that we may vſe
this herb, &amp; enioy the vertues therof
foure maner waies. Firſt in the gréene
leafe: ſecondly in the pouder: thirdly, in
the iuyce: and fourthly, in the diſtilled
water. Vnto theſe may be added the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
<pb facs="tcp:25153:27"/>
in the whiche the hearbe is boiled.
For the moſt part, the vertue that is in
Sinne, is in them all: ſo that in dyuers
diſeaſes, for the which the hearb is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinable,
for lack of the one, a man may
vſe the other. The gréene leafe may be
taken with bread and butter, as we vſe
to take Sage and Parcely in a morning
to breakefaſt. And if it ſéeme too bitter
in the taſte, it may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with hony in
ſteade of butter. It may be alſo taken in
potage boiled among other hearbs. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
being ſhred ſmall, it may be very
well drunke with Ale, Béere, or Wine:
ſpecially poſſet ale, or burnt wine. It is

or elſe it is receyued by the

               <p>Being receiued into the body, it may

you liſt, you may boile it with Wine, &amp;
Hony, or Sugar to make it ſweete, and
then drinke it warme.</p>
               <p>The pouder may be taken with hony
vpon a kniues point, or with bread and
Hony if you liſt, or elſe it may be drunk
with Ale, Béere, or Wine, The diſtilled

with Sack after meate, ſpecially if the
ſtomack be weake and colde.</p>
               <p>The licour or brothe in the whiche
the hearb is boiled, maye be made thus.
Take a quart of running water, ſéeth it
&amp; ſkim it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> put into it a good handfull

better parte of the licour be conſumed:
then drinke it with wine, or if you liſte
with Honie, or Sugare, to make it the
more pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the taſt. Or elſe make a

ſmall, boyle them all togither in a

bitter it maye be made ſwéete, as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaide.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is to be noted, that the
pouder and water of the hearb is moſte
to be regarded, and ſpecially the water:
for they may be long preſerued, ſo that a

to vſe, as néed ſhall require, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as he cannot haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuice, nor the grene

of bitterneſſe) may be drunke by it ſelfe
alone: for the ſtomacke and taſte wyll
beare it, and like of it aſwel as of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water.
Notwithſtanding, if the ſéede bée

               <p>The water diſtilled out of the rootes
of <hi>Angelica,</hi> or the pouder of the ſame, is
good againſte gnawing and paine of the
bellie, that commeth with colde, if the
bodie be not bounde withall. And it is
good againſt all inwarde diſeaſes: as the
Pleuriſie, in the beginning, before the
<pb facs="tcp:25153:31"/>
heate of the inflamation be come into
the bodie. For it diſolueth and ſcattereth
abroade ſuch humours, as vſeth to giue
matter to the Pleuriſie. Moreouer, it
is good for the diſeaſes of the Lunges, if
they come of a colde cauſe: and for the
Stranguria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a cold cauſe, or of a ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
It is good for a woman that is
in trauell with childe. It is good alſo to
driue winde away that is in the bodye,
and to eaſe the paine that commeth of
the ſame. The roote may be ſodden in
water, or in wine, as the nature of him
that is ſicke doth require. The iuyce of
the roote, put into an hollowe tooth, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
away the ache, and ſo likewiſe doth
the diſtilled water put in at the eare.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the iuyce, and the water al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of <hi>Angelica,</hi> quicken the eye ſight, and
breake the little filmes that go ouer the
eyes: wherof darkneſſe doth riſe. Of the
rootes of <hi>Angelica,</hi> and Pitche, maye be
made a good Emplaſter, againſt the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of madde beaſtes. The water,
the iuyce, or the pouder of the root, ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled
vpon the diſeaſed place, is a verye
<pb facs="tcp:25153:31"/>
good remedie againſt old, and déep ſores.
For they do ſcoure, and clenſe them, and
couer the bones with fleſhe. The water
of the ſame, in a colde cauſe, is good to be
layd on places diſeaſed with the Goute,
and Sciatica. For it ſtancheth the pain,
and melteth awaye the tough humours
that are gathered togither. The ſéede is
of like vertue with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> root. The wild <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi>

make an end, willing all men rightly to
