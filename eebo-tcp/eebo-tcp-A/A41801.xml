            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AMong the many and various Dispensations of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings which God hath always confer'd on his Church-Militant here on earth, This of reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his holy Will to the sons of Men, upon a due and serious reflection, seems to be none of the meanest: for if the gradual conveyance of the S. Scriptures be considered in all its circumstances, it will not only exhibit unto us matter of Astonishment and Wonder; but it will also be an invinsible Argument to prove their Divine extraction.</p>
            <p>To omit the many and wonderful preservations of the Law under the Jewish Oeconomy, and to proceed to the Gospel-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation: When Christianity began so mightily to prevail, and to extend it self over the whole World; then it was that the Enemies of those Sacred Writings began to appear: the Devil (who hath never omitted any Arts or Stratagems that would any way conduce to the eternal ruine of man-kind) rallies up all his forces in opposition to them; well knowing how greatly they would tend to the diminution of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; for as long as those Sacred Oracles stood as the Basis and Foundation on which Christianity was built, his other attempts must necessarily prove vain and unsuccessful; wherefore like a subtil Enemy, and cunning Polititian, he levies all his Forces to destroy the Foundation: rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that if that were once shattered, the whole Fabrick must consequently come to ruine and desolation. And in prosecution of this Design, he and his Agents have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb facs="tcp:94934:3"/>
to invalidate those Writings; though as to their matter of Fact, not a <hi>Julian,</hi> nor a <hi>Celsus</hi> did ever assume impudence enough to deny: and that they might the more amuse the minds of men, they imposed spurious writings, under the Names of the venerable Pen-men of the Sacred Scriptures: but this fallacy was soon discover'd; for the Majesty of those Holy Writings eminently appearing above the others, soon put a period to this Controversie. All pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Revelations have visibly discover'd their nakedness, and soon betrayed their own mean descent. But as it is commonly observed, that after a Defeat, there is a general Rendezvous of all Forces, to make the last assault, which is usually very formidable; so these infernal Powers having been disappointed in their first enterprize, could not rest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, until they had changed the Scene, and appear'd in more hostile shape than ever: Defamation now was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but the total Destruction of the Word of God was design'd.</p>
            <p>And now to the amazement of the World (after many other mighty Enemies to the Christian Cause) up starts <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> an Enemy no less potent than formidable, who set forth an Edict that all Christians should deliver up their Scriptures, and that the Writings of the Church should be burnt, which was prosecuted with great rigour and fierceness; and he was so confident of the success of it, that on a Column which was erected to him, as a Trophy of his extinguishing the Christian faith, he had this in the inscription.<hi>—Superstitione Christi ubique deleta,</hi> Grut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script. <hi>pag. 280.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what could now be expected, but that the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Name should have been extirpate? for Persecutions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb facs="tcp:94934:3"/>
again to look with a most terrible aspect; and now it was that such a multitude of Christians offer'd themselves as Victims to appease the rage of their cruel Adversaries with their Martyr-flames, rather than deliver up what was most dear to them in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> their Bibles: and those who by fear or any other inducements were perswaded to the contrary, were approbriously called <hi>Traditores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And who could imagine that this stratagem should have been defeated? Who could have thought that these inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive and inveterate Enemies should have their designs and intentions thus frustrated? But God, who at all times hath given us signal Demonstrations of their Divinity, by his miraculous and wonderful preservation of them, was not wanting at this time, but mightily rescued them from the flames of these wicked Persecutors. What was here but the special Providence, the Finger of God, to be seen in this great Deliverance? Who but an Omnipotent Power could now sustain the Christian faith, when all humane and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Power were bent against it? But thus did the sacred Oracles triumph over its Adversaries, baffled all assaults and Enemies, and stood unmov'd like a mighty Rock in the midst of the Sea, outbraving all Storms and Tempests.</p>
            <p>But although the Sacred Scriptures have been thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed down to us, having their Divine Authority confirm'd by the suffrages of all Ages; and although they answer the ends and purposes of their Author, <hi>viz.</hi> That they should be the Rule of our Faith, the infallible Standard by which all Actions should be measured; That in them are contained the whole Essentials of Religion, the words of Eternal Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet it is thought (and not without just grounds) a Design that may not be altogether unuseful to the Publick,
<pb facs="tcp:94934:4"/>
for the more exquisite use upon any emergent occasion, that those Scriptures which lie here and there dispers'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Sacred Repository, belonging to one place or Subject, be reduced to their proper Heads, that so the use of the whole may be rendred more obvious to the diligent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer. This is the Design of the ensuing Tract; a Work of no small pains and labour: For it is possible a man may be a good Textuary, and yet upon many occasions may want that full satisfaction which those sacred Treasures afford: To obviate which difficulty, no Concordance (that I know of will very much contribute.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the Reduction of the Sacred Scriptures to this Method must needs be very grateful to any that have time and leisure for a serious perusal of them, especially to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who cannot chuse but frequently have recourse to a Work of this nature.</p>
            <p>As to the whole Composure, or selecting the Texts of Scripture to their several Heads or Subjects, or the perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of them to the place they belong to, either for proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, illustration, or the like: The Author hath consulted several Eminent and learned Men, who have fufficiently given their Approbation of it, and greatly encouraged its Publication.</p>
            <p>The Epistle to the Reader will give a particular account of the usefulness of the Work.</p>

            <head>The <hi>PREFACE</hi> to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THat the Holy Scriptures are one of the greatest blessings which God bestows upon the sons of men, is generally acknowledged by all who know any thing of the value and worth of them. To shew their Use and Excellency, is beyond the Authors present design or intendment; 'tis already done by one or other to good purpose every day. In them the Lord hath dilucidly displayed that Counsel of his Will, that is of infinite concernment to us to understand, in order to our present being accepted of him here, and at last brought to the fullest enjoyment of himself in glory. 'Tis wonderful to behold, how full and perfect this Word is, with respect to this end; What can man desire to know, which is necessary hereunto, that the light thereof discovers not? What di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection can he expect, by which he may be fortified against all enemies of his good, either within or without him, that is not there given? What encouragements would he have which are not therein displayed before him? And what Cavils can be brought against any part of Truth contained therein, to which they themselves yield not a full resolve? (one place of Scripture so exactly clearing, expounding, and illustrating another) yet (to amazement) its observ'd, That man (who is so highly and principally concerned in it) doth too too little value it; he can weary himself in any secular affair, but diligently to search the Scriptures (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Lords advice) is to him tedious and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densom. Few covet to be mighty in the Scriptures; though convinced, their great concern is inveloped in them: A spirit of self-fulness, pride, spiritual sloth, drowsiness and
<pb facs="tcp:94934:5"/>
deadness, lyes at the bottom of this sinful neglect. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, awaken persons to a more diligent thorow search of the mind of God herein, is a service no less profitable than seasonable at this day. And what greater external en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, than to make that facile and easie, which seem'd inconquerably arduous and difficult?</p>
            <p>This is the design of the ensuing Treatise: nor is the Author altogether without hopes (wherein he hath the concurring-judgment of several eminently learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Divines who have perused it) but, by the blessing of God, it may have a singular tendency to the enlightning of some, and establishing of others in divine Tuths (when <hi>uno intuitu</hi> they see the Scriptures, upon which they are built), and enabling them with ease to confute gainsayers. This hath prevailed upon him, to give leave for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of it fot the Common good, having found it to be of great use to himself to the ends before-mentioned. For here the several Texts of Holy Scripture (which lie scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the book of God, are collected together, transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and placed (in the order as they lie in the Bible) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der several and particular Heads (a fruit of many years la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in frequent reading through the whole Old and New Testament, with serious thoughts upon it, and prayer to God, to the end the scope and meaning of the Holy Ghost in each Text might be found out). And where any Subject is fallen on, and mentioned in the general head, (and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times also in a particular head) there (for the most part) is to be found all that relate to that matter, immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing under particular heads, or subdivisions, to the end that the whole thereof may be met with together: or, at least, there are references to some other general or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar head, where it is placed more properly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94934:5"/>
And here note, Christian Reader, That thou hast not only the places positive to the Subject there, but also such which are any ways argumentative, or enforcing (whether by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, the equity of the things, the nature of God, his approbation of Promises to, or threatnings against it) or any way illustrating or expounding of it, by whatsoever terms they are expressed: whereof a little use of this Treatise will soon give thee a full evidence.</p>
            <p>But, to prevent prejudice and mistakes, and give thee some light in the way and method the Author hath taken, He proposeth to thy observation these few things following.</p>
            <p>First, To prevent prejudice, do the Author and thy self this right, Not to make a judgment by the reading of one or two Texts at the beginning of any head: for possibly they may not at the first blush seem to thee so pertinent to the matter, as others do which follow; they may be only argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative, and not positive: For the Author so placed them on purpose, that they might run in order, as they lie in the Bible, that the Reader might go to any Text of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Testament, without turning backward and forward, and for other advantages; and thence it happens sometimes, That the Scriptures less to the purpose, first occur to thy View.</p>
            <p>Likewise, pass not sentence upon any Text thou shalt find under any head, as impertinent to the Subject there, until thou hast seriously weighed the same: for possibly in so doing, thou mayst discern something in that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which thou never didst observe before, nor mightest have taken notice of, had not the Head or Subject there, turned thy thoughts upon it.</p>
            <p>And then, the Author doubteth not, but that the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it self (when judiciously considered) will prevent this Censure, That it's a needless Work, as having been done
<pb facs="tcp:94934:6"/>
already by others: This being a thing of another nature than any yet extant, and will be helpful at another rate. For, (notwithstanding any other helps) the finding out of apt Scriptures for illustrating, confirming, and making use of any Truth which may be upon the thoughts of any, have been, as it is, a difficult and laborious Work; and thence men oft-times use Scriptures, either not Apt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the intent of the Holy Ghost there; or such, the genuine sense of which is <hi>doubted.</hi> And for the use of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordances herein, each mans memory must record the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: for they must first occur to his thoughts, then his judgment must fix upon some word therein, under which the Text is placed: and 'tis possible not hit the right term under which it is; and oft-times look a long time ere he come to it, because of the multitude of words there used: and happily miss at last too, and be put upon searching under another term. But here thou mayst only turn to the Subject thou enquirest after, and (without any such steps) find Scriptures full and apt thereto (by whatsoever Terms or Phrases they are expressed) occur to your Eye at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; and almost (if not altogether) all the Scripture affords to that Subject; and present thee with matter of Enlargement, which possibly thou thoughtest not of.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To give thee some light in the Method, and to help thee in the use of this.</p>
            <p>First, Take notice, that in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. <hi>[of Saints fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings]</hi> The first Texts are to prove each person his Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; then the next following, their failings: and this is done on purpose, that it might appear they are the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Saints: and so proper to the Head.</p>
            <p>2dly, Note also, That the words within a Parenthesis beginning with [or] are the Marginal Readings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94934:6"/>
3dly, Some general Heads have no particulars follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the whole placed under that general Head. This is so done, either because the Texts which the Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords to that Subject, are but few in the whole, and so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run through; or that the matters are so various, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every verse carries a distinct thing in it, yet still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the general Head; as that <hi>[of the Saints Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges]</hi> each Text almost a distinct Priviledg: so that <hi>[of the Character of Saints]</hi> and some others of like nature: And here to have descended to particular Heads, would have been tedious and unnecessary; for the words being there transcribed, the Reader may presently inform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in the whole, and in every particular.</p>
            <p>Lastly, A little pains in observing the Contents or Table in the front of the Book, which doth contain the General and particular Heads therein, and also the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences thereto, and directs to Chapter and Page where each lieth, will enable thee to discern more of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and usefulness of this Work, than can be well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in a short Epistle.</p>
            <p>Therefore this shall suffice, supposing the Work it self will shew its own usefulness and advantage to Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about Divine matters: holding a man to one Subject, and yielding variety of matter to enforce it upon the mind, and leave impression there: when bare reading a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or two (as fome use to do as a task) proves not effectual for that end; and searching proves laborious: and to many (by reason of the difficulty of finding) discouraging also.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Scriptures, Written Word of God, the Word of Truth, their Authority, Use, End and Excellency, <hi>Heb. 1. 1. ch. 2. 3, 4.</hi>

            <p>THerefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart, and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. And you shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou lyest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt write them upon the dore-post of thy house, and upon thy gates, That your days may be multiplied, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 11. 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt read the Law before all Israel in their hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they may hear, that they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and observe to do all the words of this Law. And that their Children who have not known may hear and learn to fear the Lord, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 31. 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Josiah</hi> heard it read, he rent his cloths, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have esteemed (hid or laid up) the words of his mouth more than my necessary food (or appointed portion) <hi>Job</hi> 23. 12.</p>
            <p>The word of the Lord is tryed (or refined,) <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 30. <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 6.</p>
            <p>The law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul, the Testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart, the commandment of the Lord is pure enlightning the eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether, more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired than fine gold; sweeter also than the honey and the honey-combs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moreover by them is thy servant warned, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Lo I come, in the volume of the Book it is written of me, <hi>&amp;c. Psal.</hi> 40. 7.</p>
            <p>He established a Testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children, that the generation to come might know, the children, who should be born should arise and declare to their Children, that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments, and might not be as their fathers, <hi>&amp;c. Psal.</hi> 78. 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of the most high. Therefore he brought down their heart, <hi>&amp;c. Psal.</hi> 107. 11, 12.</p>

Wherewithall shall a young man cleanse his ways, by taking heed according to thy word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Remember thy word unto thy servant, upon which thou caused me to hope, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Thy word hath quickened me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Unless thy law had been my delight, I had perished in my affliction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thou through thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hast made me wiser than mine enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have more understanding than all my teachers; for thy Testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the ancients, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How sweet are thy words to my taste! thy word is a lamp to my feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hope in thy word, the entrance of thy words giveth light, it giveth understanding to the simple, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 9, 11, 49, 50, 92, 96, 98, 99, 103, 105, 114, 130.</p>
            <p>All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: when they hear the words of thy mouth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 4.</p>
            <p>He shewed his words to Jacob, and his statutes and his judgments unto Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his Judgments, they have not known them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed; but he who feareth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments shall be rewarded (or in peace). <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 13.</p>
            <p>To the Law and to the Testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light (or morning) in them, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 8. 20.</p>
            <p>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who bringeth good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidings, who publisheth peace, who bringeth good-tidings of good, who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheth salvation, who saith unto Zion thy God reigneth, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 52. 7.</p>
            <p>As the rain cometh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So shall my word be which goeth out of my mouth: It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>To this man will I look, to him who is poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And trembleth at my word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hear the word of the Lord, ye who tremble at his word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He shall <hi>&amp;c. Isa.</hi> 66. 2, 5.</p>
            <p>Behold the word of the Lord, is to them a reproach: they have no delight in it. Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c. Jer.</hi> 6. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>The prophet who hath a dream let him tell a dream; and he who hath my word let him speak my word faithfully: what is the chaff to the wheat, saith the Lord? Is not my word like as fire, saith the Lord, and like a hammer which breaketh the rock in pieces? <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>Because Ephraim hath made many altars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have written unto him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing, <hi>Hose.</hi> 8. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Behold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will send a famine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not of bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but of hearing the words of the Lord, and they shall wander from sea to sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find, <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Christ (when the Devil tempted him,) said to him, it is written, man lives not by bread alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is written again, thou shall, <hi>&amp;c. Matt.</hi> 4. 4, 7, 10.</p>
            <p>Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doth them, I will liken him to a wise man who buildeth his house upon a rock, <hi>&amp;c. Matt.</hi> 7. 24, 25.</p>

When the Pharisees contended, Christ said unto them, have ye not read, what David did when he was an hungry, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath-day, <hi>&amp;c? Matt.</hi> 12. 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Have ye not read, that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What God hath joyned together let no man, <hi>&amp;c. Matt.</hi> 19. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Did ye never read in the Scriptures, that, the stone which the builders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, the same is become the head of the corner, <hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 42.</p>
            <p>Have you not read, that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am, <hi>&amp;c. Matt.</hi> 22. 31, 32.</p>
            <p>All ye shall be offended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is written; I will smite the shepherd, and the flock shall be scattered abroad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all this was done, that the scriptures of the Prophets might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 31, 53, 54, 56.</p>
            <p>Jesus said, do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, <hi>&amp;c. Mark.</hi> 12. 24.</p>
            <p>They have Moses and the Prophets let them hear them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be perswaded though one rose from the dead, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 29, 31.</p>
            <p>When Jesus taught his Disciples, he said, O fools and slow of heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that the Prophets have spoken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And beginning at Moses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He expounded unto them in all the scriptures, the things concerning himself, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and in the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and in the <hi>Psalms</hi> concerning me; then opened he their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings that they might understand the scriptures; and he said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoveth Christ to suffer, <hi>&amp;c. Luk.</hi> 24. 25, 27, 44, 45, 46.</p>
            <p>Ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, ye believe not. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which testify of me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me: But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? <hi>John</hi> 5. 38, 39, 46, 47.</p>
            <p>Christ said, it is written in the Prophets, And they shall be all taught of God, every one therefore who hath heard and learned of the father, <hi>&amp;c. Joh.</hi> 6. 45.</p>
            <p>I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me, and they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither pray I for these alone; but for them also, who shall believe on me through their word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 8, 20.</p>
            <p>These things are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life, <hi>John</hi> 20. 31.</p>
            <p>When the Apostles preached, they proved their doctrine by the scriptures; but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And David, <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 2. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. <hi>ch.</hi> 7. <hi>ch.</hi> 17. 2, 3.</p>

            <p>Samaria had received the word of God, yet had not received the holy Ghost. The Eunuch reading the scripture, had Phillip sent to him to convert him by it, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 14, 15, 16, 29, 30, 31, 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Sergius Paulus desired to hear the word of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The whole city came together to hear the word of God, <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 13. 7, 44, 45, 46.</p>
            <p>Those were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11.</p>
            <p>Apollos, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mighty in the scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewed by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 24, 25, 28.</p>
            <p>Paul said, I wist not brethren that he was the High-priest: For it is written thou shall not speak evil of the Ruler, <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 23. 5.</p>

            <p>Saying <hi>(saith Paul)</hi> none other things than those which the Prophets and Moses did say should come, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 22.</p>
            <p>There came many to Paul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, perswading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses and out of the Prophets from morning, <hi>&amp;c. Act.</hi> 28. 23.</p>
            <p>Which he had promised, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by his Prophets in the holy scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Gospel of Christ: For it is the power of God to salvation, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 1. 2, 16.</p>

            <p>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect Angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>ch.</hi> 6. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>If any men teach otherwise, and consent not to wholsom words, the words of our Lord Jesus, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; he is proud (or a fool) knowing nothing, but doteing about questions, and strifes of words, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3, 4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</p>

Continue thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned. And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise to salvation, &amp;c. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, &amp;c. That the man of God may be perfect thorowly furnished unto all good works, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Preach the word, &amp;c. For the time will come, they will not endure sound doctrine, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Therefore ought we to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip: for if the word spoken by Angels was stedfast, &amp;c. How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them who heard, God also bearing witness both with signs, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>

            <p>The word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword; piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Every one who useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
            <p>Begat he us with the word of truth, &amp;c. Be swift to hear, &amp;c. The engraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed word able to save, &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> 1. 18, 19, 21.</p>

            <p>Being born again not of corruptible seed, but, &amp;c. by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever, &amp;c. And this is the word which by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is preached unto you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23, 25.</p>

            <p>I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth, &amp;c. Moreover, I will endeavour that you may be able after my decease, to have these things always in remembrance: for we have, &amp;c. We have also a more sure word of prophesie, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light which shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in a dark place, &amp;c. Knowing this, first, that no prophesie of the Scripture is of any private <hi>(or proper)</hi> interpretation: for the Prophesie came not in old <hi>(or any)</hi> time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>This second Epistle I write unto you, in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance, That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken of before by the holy Prophets, and of the commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Saviour, &amp;c. Paul also according unto the wisdom given unto him, hath written unto you, as also in all his epistles, &amp;c. In which are some things hard to be understood, which they who are unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, wrest as they do also other scriptures unto their own destruction, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 15, 16.</p>

            <p>It was needful for me to write to you, and exhort you, That you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints, &amp;c.

            <p>I testify, &amp;c. if any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the Plagues which are written in this book.

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the one God, Father, Son and Spirit, or the Trinity.</head>
            <p>GOD said, let us make man in our image, after our likeness, &amp;c. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26, 27. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15, 16, 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p>And the Lord God said, behold, the man is become as one of us, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22.</p>
            <p>And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, &amp;c. Go to let us go down, and there confound their language, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Not so my Lord, &amp;c. I have accepted thee concerning this thing, that I will not overthrow this City, for the which thou hast spoken, &amp;c. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah, brimstone and fire, from the Lord out of heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 18, 21, 24.</p>
            <p>And the Lord said unto Satan, the Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord who hath chosen Jerusalem, &amp;c. <hi>Zechar.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>All things are delivered unto me of my father: and no man knoweth the son but the father, neither knoweth any man the father save the son, and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him, <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 27.</p>
            <p>The woman of Canaan came to Jesus and worshipped him, saying, Lord help, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. 25.</p>
            <p>The Eleven disciples went, &amp;c. Where Jesus had appointed them, and when they saw him they worshipped him, &amp;c. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, all power is given to me in heaven and earth, go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy Ghost, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Why doth this man speak blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God only, &amp;c. but that ye may know, that the son of man hath power on earth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give sin, he saith unto the sick, &amp;c. arise, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 7, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, &amp;c. The world was made by him, &amp;c. And the word was made flesh, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 2, 10, 14.</p>
            <p>Jesus, &amp;c. knew all men, and needed not that any should testify of man: For he knew what was in man, <hi>John</hi> 2. 24, 25.</p>
            <p>No man hath ascended, &amp;c. but he who came down, &amp;c. even the son of man who is in heaven, <hi>John</hi> 3. 13.</p>
            <p>Jesus answered them, my father worketh hitherto, and I work, &amp;c. The Jews sought the more to kill him, &amp;c. Because, &amp;c. He said God was his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making himself equal with God, &amp;c. The son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the father do: for whatsoever things he doth, these also
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94934:30"/>
doth the son likewise, &amp;c. As the father raised up the dead, and quickened them, even so the son quickeneth whom he will, &amp;c. That all men should ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the son, even as they honour the father: he who honoureth not the son, honoureth not the father who sent him, <hi>John</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>What and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before, <hi>John</hi> 6. 62.</p>
            <p>Jesus said unto them, verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am, <hi>John</hi> 8. 58.</p>
            <p>Dost thou believe on the son of God? and Jesus said, &amp;c. Thou hast both seen him, and it is he who talketh with thee, &amp;c. and he worshipped him, <hi>John</hi> 9. 35, 36, 37, 38.</p>
            <p>My father who gave them me, is greater than all: and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand. I and my father are one, &amp;c. Believe the work, that ye may know, and believe that the father is in me, and I in him, <hi>John</hi> 10. 29, 30, 38.</p>
            <p>Jesus knew Lazarus was dead, <hi>John</hi> 11. 14.</p>
            <p>He who believeth on me, believeth not on me, but him who sent me. And he who seeth me, seeth him who sent me, <hi>John</hi> 12. 44, 45.</p>
            <p>Jesus knowing, &amp;c. That he was come from God, and went to God, <hi>John</hi> 13. 3.</p>
            <p>If ye had known me, ye should have known my father also: and from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him: Lord, shew us the father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus faith unto him, have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me Philip? He who hath seen me, hath seen the father, and how sayest thou shew us the father? believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me. The words I speak unto you, I speak not of my self: but the father who dwelleth in me, he doth the works. Believe me that I am in the father and the father in me, &amp;c. Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, &amp;c. I will pray the father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the spirit of truth, &amp;c. I will come to you, &amp;c. He who loveth me, I will love him and manifest my self to him, &amp;c. My father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him, &amp;c. The comforter, the holy Ghost, whom my father will send in my name, he shall teach you, <hi>John</hi> 14. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 21, 23, 26.</p>
            <p>When the spirit of truth is come, &amp;c. He will shew you things to come, he shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shew it unto you. All things which the father hath, are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you, &amp;c. Whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name, he will give it you, &amp;c. I came forth from the father, and am come into the world, again I leave the world and go to the father, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 16. 13, 14, 15, 23, 27, 28, 30.</p>
            <p>Now, O Father, glorify thou me, &amp;c. With the glory which I had with thee before the world was, &amp;c. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them, &amp;c. That they may be one, as thou father art in me and I in thee, <hi>John</hi> 17. 5, 10, 21.</p>

               <p>A man is not justified by the works of the law, &amp;c. For by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified, &amp;c. If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>That no man is justified by the law, in the sight of God it is evident: for the just shall live by faith, and the law is not of faith; but the man who doth them, shall live in them, &amp;c. Wherefore then serveth the law? it was added because of transgression, till the seed should come, &amp;c. If there had been a law given, which could have given life, verily, righteousness should have been by the law, &amp;c. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster unto Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 11, 12, 19, 21, 24.</p>

By grace ye are saved, &amp;c. Not of works, lest any man should boast, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Paul was very zealous of the law, and if any man had whereof to boast in that respect, he more; yet he accounted all but loss and dung for Christ, and that he might be found in him, not having his own righteousness, which is of the law, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>The law is good, if a man use it lawfully, knowing that the law is not made for the righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he hath saved us, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical Priesthood, &amp;c. What further need was there that another priest should rise, &amp;c? For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 11, 19. <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 8.</p>
               <p>In which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, which could not make him who did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9.</p>
               <p>For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect: For then would they not have ceased to be offered, because that the worshippers once purged, should have had no more conscience of sins: But in those sacrifices a remembrance of sin again every year: For it is not possible that the blood of Bulls and Goats should take away sins, &amp;c. Sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not, &amp;c. In burned offerings, &amp;c. Thou hadst no pleasure, &amp;c. Sacrifices which can never take away sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11. <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all. For he who said, &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> 2. 10.</p>
               <p>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6.</p>
               <p>When ye have done all these things which are commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants, we have done that which was our duty to do, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>If the ministration of death written and ingraven in stones was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which was to be done away, &amp;c. How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory; for even that which was made glorious, had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory which excelleth: For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>

The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good-tidings to the meek, he hath sent me to bind up the broken-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them who are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year, &amp;c.

               <p>Why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of his disciples, &amp;c. But we believe, that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved even as they, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>I send thee <hi>(said Christ to Paul)</hi> to open their eyes, &amp;c. that they might receive forgiveness of sins, and an inheritance among them who are sanctified through faith that is in me, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>Being justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him, &amp;c. much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life, &amp;c. If by one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence death reigned by one; much more they who receive abundance of

               <p>Abram believed in the Lord, and he counted it to him for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>He who believeth and is baptised, shall be saved, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.</p>
               <p>Blessed is she who believeth that there <hi>(or, for there)</hi> shall be a perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of those thing which were told her from the Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 45.</p>
               <p>Jesus said to the woman, thy sins are forgiven, &amp;c. Thy faith saved thee, go, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 48, 50.</p>
               <p>But to as many as received him, to them he gave power <hi>(or, the right or priviledg)</hi> to become the sons of God, to them who believe on his name, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>The son of man must be lifted up. That whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life, &amp;c. He who believeth on him is not condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. He who believeth on the son, hath everlasting life, <hi>John</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16, 18, 36.</p>
               <p>He who heareth my word, and believeth on him who sent me, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, and shall not come into condemnation: but is passed from death unto life, &amp;c. Whom he hath sent, him ye believe not, &amp;c. And ye will not come to me that ye might have life, <hi>John</hi> 5. 24, 38, 40.</p>
               <p>What shall we do that we may work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, this is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent, &amp;c. He who cometh to me shall never hunger, and he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on me, shall never thirst, &amp;c. This is the will of him who sent me, that every one who seeth the son and believeth on him, may have everlasting life, &amp;c. He who believeth on me hath everlasting life, &amp;c. I am the living bread which came down from heaven, if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever, &amp;c. Whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, <hi>John</hi> 6. 28, 29, 35, 40, 47, 51, 54.</p>

               <p>Jesus said unto Thomas, reach hither thy finger, &amp;c. Be not faithless but believing, &amp;c.

These things are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and

that believing ye might have life through his name, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 20. 27, 29, 31.</p>
               <p>Through his name, whosoever believeth in him, shall receive remission of sins, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43.</p>
               <p>By him all who believe are justified from all things, &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 39.</p>
               <p>We believe that through the grace of our Lord Jesus we shall be saved, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 11.</p>
               <p>Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved and thine house, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>I kept back nothing which was profitable, &amp;c. Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>That they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them who are sanctified by faith that is in me, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18.</p>
               <p>The Gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one who believeth, &amp;c. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith; as it is written the just shall live by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Now the righteousness of God without the law is manifest, &amp;c. Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all them who believe, &amp;c. Jesus Christ whom God hath set forth to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation through faith in his blood, &amp;c. That he may be just, and the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus, &amp;c. We conclude, that a man is justified by faith without, &amp;c. It is one God, who shall justifie the Circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 25, 26, 28, 30.</p>
               <p>To him who worketh not, but believeth on him who justifieth the ungodly; his faith is accounted for rightecusness, &amp;c. We say, that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness, &amp;c. Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, &amp;c. It was imputed to him for righteousness, &amp;c. For us also to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him who raised up Jesus our Lord, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 9, 16, 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, &amp;c. We have access by faith, into this grace wherein we stand, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>We are saved by hope, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24.</p>
               <p>The Gentiles, &amp;c. have attained unto the righteousness which is of faith, &amp;c. But Israel hath not attained, &amp;c. because they sought it not by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30, 32.</p>
               <p>Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one who believeth, &amp;c. If thou confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, &amp;c. For the scripture faith, whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 16.</p>
               <p>For by faith ye stand, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
               <p>A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ: Even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I now live in the flesh; I live by the faith of the son of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16, 20.</p>
               <p>Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness, &amp;c. God would justifie the heathen through faith, &amp;c. They who are of faith, are blessed with faithful Abraham, &amp;c. That the promise through faith of Jesus, might be given unto them who believe, &amp;c. We are all the children of God by faith in Jesus Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 6, 8, 9, 11, 22, 26.</p>
               <p>We through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith: For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth any thing, but faith which worketh by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>In whom also, after that ye believed, ye were sealed with the holy spirit, &amp;c. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
               <p>By grace are ye saved through faith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>We have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him, &amp;c. That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 12, 17.</p>
               <p>Not having mine own righteousness, &amp;c. but that which is through the faith of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
               <p>You are risen with him, through the faith of the operation of God, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>God hath, &amp;c. chosen you to salvation through sanctification, &amp;c. and belief of the truth, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>Now the end of the commandment is Charity, &amp;c. and of faith unfeined, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>Wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p>Leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, &amp;c. Of faith towards God, &amp;c. but followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 12.</p>
               <p>Cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward, &amp;c. Yet a little while, and he who shall come, will come, and will not tarry. Now the just shall live by faith, &amp;c. We are not of them who draw back to perdition; but of them who believe to the saving of the soul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22, 35, 37, 38, 39.</p>
               <p>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Kain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, &amp;c. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death, &amp;c. He had this Testimony, that he pleased God, but without faith it is impossible to please God. For he who cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him. By faith Noah, &amp;c. And became heir of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which is by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>For you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation: For you, who do believe in God who raised him, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 21.</p>
               <p>Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner-stone, &amp;c. and he who believeth on him shall not be confounded. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
               <p>This is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and love, &amp;c. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God, &amp;c. This is

the victory which overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he who overcometh the world, but he who believeth that Jesus is the son of God, &amp;c. He who believeth on the son of God hath the witness in himself, &amp;c. You that believe, &amp;c. that ye may know that ye have eternal life, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 1, 4, 5, 10, 13.</p>
               <p>Blessed be God, &amp;c. who according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3.</p>

He who faith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him, &amp;c. he who abideth in him, ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked, &amp;c. He who faith he is in the light, and hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is in darkness even until now: He who loveth his brother, abideth in the light, &amp;c. if any man loveth the world, the love of the father is not in him, &amp;c. if ye know that he is righteous, ye know <hi>(or, know ye)</hi> that every one who doth righteousness, is born of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15, 29.</p>

               <p>How should man be just with God <hi>(or, before God)</hi> If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand, &amp;c. Whom though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, I would make supplication to my judge, &amp;c. If I justifie my self, my own mouth shall condemn me. If I say I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it shall also prove me perverse, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 1, 2, 3, 15, 20.</p>
               <p>Who can understand his errours? Cleanse thou me from secret faults, keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 12, 13.</p>

               <p>The flesh lusteth against the spirit, &amp;c. so that ye cannot do the things that ye would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
               <p>If any man be overtaken in a fault, ye who are spiritual restore such, &amp;c. Considering thy self, lest thou also be tempted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>I have no man like minded, &amp;c. For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Paul saith, I count not my self to have apprehended but this one thing, &amp;c. I press towards the mark, &amp;c. Let us therefore as many as be perfect, be thus minded, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>For in many things we offend all: if any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, <hi>James</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p>If we say we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, &amp;c. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a lyar, and his word is not in us, <hi>John</hi> 1. 1, 8, 9, 10.</p>

               <p>They will kill me; they will save thee alive: say, I pray thee, thou art my sister, &amp;c. And when God had promised him to inherit the land, he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? &amp;c. When the promise was made to him of a child, he fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child, &amp;c. O that Ishmael might live before thee, &amp;c.

            <p>God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed towards his name, &amp;c. wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath, that by two immutable things wherein it was impossible for God to lye, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope set before us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10, 17, 18.</p>

            <p>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

               <p>I beseech you brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, your reasonable service; and be not conformed unto this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, that acceptable will of God, &amp;c.

               <p>It is high time to awake out of sleep, &amp;c. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

               <p>None of us liveth to himself, and no man dyeth to himself: for whether we live, we live unto the Lord, &amp;c. Whether we live therefore, or dye, we are the Lords, &amp;c.

                  <p>And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the Lord God of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice, &amp;c. Therefore the Lord said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant, &amp;c. I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>It was charged me by the word of the Lord, saying, Eat no bread, &amp;c. Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the Lord, &amp;c. and hast eaten bread, and drank water, &amp;c. Thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers, &amp;c. A Lyon met him by the way, and slew him, &amp;c. It is the man of God, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 8, 9, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>Tell Jeroboam, &amp;c. Forasmuch as I have exalted thee from among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and made thee prince, &amp;c. yet thou hast done evil above all that were before thee, for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, &amp;c. Therefore behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him who pisseth against the wall, &amp;c. him who dyeth of Jeroboam in the city, shall dogs eat; and him who dyeth in the field, shall the fowls of the air eat; for the Lord hath spoken it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Baasha smote all the house of Jeroboam, he left not to Jeroboam any that

breathrd, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the Lord, &amp;c. Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he had sinned, and which he made Israel sin, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 27, 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>The very like threatning did God send to Baasha for his sin, &amp;c. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly executed by Zimri his servant, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>God threatens, and sends a famine in Israel for the sins of Ahab, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>He killed Naboth and possessed his vineyard, &amp;c. Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou killed and taken possession also, &amp;c? In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine, &amp;c. All this execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted against him, Jezebel and Ahabs house, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 14, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24. Chap. 22. 38. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 33.</p>
                  <p>Ahaziah fell down, &amp;c. He sent to enquire of the God of Ekron, &amp;c. And the Lord by Elijah sends, thus: Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron? Now therefore thus saith the Lord, Thou shalt not come down from thy bed, &amp;c. but shalt sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye, &amp;c. So he dyed according to the word of the Lord, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4, 6, 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>So it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God, &amp;c. and walked in the statutes of the heathen, &amp;c. The Lord testified against them by the hand of all the Prophets, all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your ways, &amp;c. notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardned their necks, &amp;c. Therefore the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight, &amp;c. And the Lord rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of the spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, &amp;c. and hath made Judah also to sin, &amp;c. Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing evil upon Jeroboam and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle, &amp;c. I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hands of their enemies, &amp;c. because they have done, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>The Lord turned not from the fierceness of his wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked wirhal: And the Lord faid, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel; and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I have said, my name shall be there, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 26, 27.</p>

                  <p>Uzziah the king, when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, &amp;c. He went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense; and when the Priests withstood him, he was wrath; and while he was yet wrath with the Priests, the leprosie even rose up in his forehead, &amp;c. The Lord had

                  <p>Moreover, all the chief of the Priests and the people transgressed very much, &amp;c. And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, &amp;c. but they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his word, and misused his Prophets, until the wrath of God arose against his people, till there was no remedy: therefore he brought upon them the King of the Chaldees, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>

               <p>Love is as strong as death, &amp;c many waters cannot quench love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self: on these two commandments hang all the law and the Prophets, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. 39, 40.</p>
               <p>The love of many shall wax cold, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. 12.</p>
               <p>A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another, as I have loved you, that ye also love one another: by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love one another, <hi>John</hi> 13. 34, 35.</p>
               <p>This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 12, 13, 17.</p>
               <p>We being many are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another, &amp;c. let love be without dissimulation, &amp;c. be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love <hi>(or, in the love of the brethren) Rom.</hi> 12. 5, 9, 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13, 25, 27.</p>
               <p>Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he who loveth another, hath fulfilled the law, &amp;c. it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Though I speak with the tongue of men or angels, &amp;c. have the gift of prophesie, &amp;c. have all faith, &amp;c. bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing: charity suffereth long, &amp;c. charity never faileth, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13.</p>

               <p>The sruit of the spirit is love, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
               <p>Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, &amp;c. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:94934:141"/>
I pray that your love may abound more and more in knowledg, &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>Having the same love, &amp;c. look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 2, 4.</p>
               <p>We give thanks, &amp;c. since we heard, &amp;c. of the love which ye have unto all saints, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 3, 4. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
               <p>That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Above all these things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
               <p>The Lord make you to increase and abound in love one towards another, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
               <p>As touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you: for ye your selves are taught of God to love one another, &amp;c. that ye increase more, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>We are bound to thank God, &amp;c. because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all towards each other aboundeth, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p>Now the end of the commandment is, love out of a pure heart, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>Follow, &amp;c. love, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
               <p>I thank my God, &amp;c. hearing of thy love, &amp;c. toward all saints, <hi>Philem.</hi> v. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and labour of love which ye have shewed towards his name, in that ye have ministred to the saints, and do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
               <p>Let brotherly love continue, <hi>Heb</hi> 13. 1.</p>
               <p>If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self, ye do well, <hi>James</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>If ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, &amp;c. this wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom descendeth not from above, &amp;c. <hi>James</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit, unto unseigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart servently, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
               <p>Love the brotherhood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>Finally, &amp;c. love as brethren, <hi>(or, loving to brethren),</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>And above all things, have fervent charity among your selves, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 8.</p>

               <p>Is not of God, neither he who loveth not his brother: for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, &amp;c. We know that we are passed from death to life, because we love the brethren, &amp;c. we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren; let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Let us love one another: for love is of God, and every one who loveth, is born of God, and knoweth God: he who loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love, &amp;c. if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another, &amp;c. if any man say he loveth God, and hateth his brother, he is a lyar, &amp;c. this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment have we from him, that he who loveth God, love his brother also, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 7, 8, 11, 12, 20, 21. 2 <hi>Epist.

                  <p>Let not your hearts be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me, <hi>John</hi> 14. 1.</p>

He who abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit, &amp;c. If ye abide in me, &amp;c. ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you, <hi>John</hi> 15. 4, 5, 7.</p>
                  <p>He who spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all: how shall he with him also freely give us all things? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</p>
                  <p>Be careful for nothing: but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanks-giving: let your request be made known unto God: and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts, &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6, 7.</p>

               <p>Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 20.</p>

               <p>He who is least in Zion, and he who remaineth in Jesusalem, shall be called holy, &amp;c. when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughter of Zion, &amp;c. by the spitit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4. 3, 4.</p>

               <p>I will put a new spirit in you, &amp;c. that they may walk in my statutes, &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 19, 20.</p>

               <p>I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesie, &amp;c. and also upon the servants, and upon the hand-maids in those days will I pour out my spirit, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28, 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 16, 17.</p>

               <p>He who believeth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water: but this spake he of the spirit, which they who believed on him should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 38, 39.</p>
               <p>I will pray the father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the spirit of truth, whom the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive, &amp;c.

                     <p>Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councels: and they will scourge you in their Synagogues: and ye shall be brought before governours and kings for my sake, &amp;c. and the brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father the child, &amp;c. and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake, &amp;c.

If this City be builded, and the walls set up again, then will not they pay toll, tribute, &amp;c. and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings: now because we have maintenance from the kings palace, it was not meet for us to see the kings dishonour, &amp;c.

Let it please the king that it may be written, that they may be destroyed: and I will pay, &amp;c. The king grants his desire, &amp;c. <hi>Esther</hi> 3. 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>

                     <hi>10thly,</hi> That God will not always chide, nor suffer his to be under afflictions and persecutions; they shall have an end, he will bring deliverance, and restore joy.</head>
                  <p>After Israel had been long and sorely oppressed, and afflicted by the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, the Lord sent Moses for their deliverance: and said, I have surely seen the afflictions of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters, &amp;c. and I am come-down to deliver them out of their hand, &amp;c. and to bring them up out of that land, unto a good land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10. chap. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>Yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them to destroy them utterly, &amp;c. but I will for their sakes remember the covenant, &amp;c. I am the Lord, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 43, 44, 45.</p>
                  <p>For the Lord will judge his people, and repent him for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, &amp;c. he will be merciful to his land, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 36, 43.</p>
                  <p>He maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 18.</p>
                  <p>And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, &amp;c. also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 10.</p>
                  <p>The needy shall not always be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 18.</p>
                  <p>Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble, &amp;c. to judg the fatherless and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:94934:185"/>
the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress (or, <hi>terrifie), Psal.</hi> 10. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, saith the Lord, I will set him in safety from him who would ensnare him, (or, <hi>puffeth at them), Psal.</hi> 12. 5.</p>
                  <p>Sing unto the Lord, O ye Saints of his, &amp;c. for his anger endureth but a moment, &amp;c. weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 4, 5.</p>

                  <p>I waited patiently for the Lord, &amp;c. he brought me up also out of an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Call upon me in the time of trouble, I will deliver thee, and thou, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15.</p>

                  <p>I will hear what God the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace to his people: but let them not turn again to folly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 85. 8.</p>
                  <p>The Lord is merciful and gracious, &amp;c. he will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger for ever, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 8, 9, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>The rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 125. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>They who sow in tears, shall reap in joy: he who goeth forth and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, &amp;c. shall doubtless come again with rejoycing, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 126. 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>The Lord will judg his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 135. 14.</p>

                  <p>The Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet chuse Israel, and set them in their own land, &amp;c. and they shall rule over their oppressors, &amp;c. the Lord will give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve, <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>God hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 13.</p>
                  <p>The redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion, &amp;c. they shall obtain gladness and joy. Sorrow and mourning shall flee away, I, I am he who comforteth you, &amp;c. hear now this thou afflicted, &amp;c. I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, &amp;c. thou shalt no more drink it again, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 11, 12, 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>For a small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercy will I

gather thee: in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the fouls I have made. For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, &amp;c. and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. I have seen his ways, I will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him, and, &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>In my wroth I smote thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee, <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. 10.</p>
                  <p>The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, &amp;c. to bind up the broken hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, &amp;c. to comfort all who mourn; to appoint unto them who mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, and the oyl of joy for mourning, &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord, because they called thee an outcast, saying, This is Zion whom no man seeketh after, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 30. 17.</p>
                  <p>He who scattereth Israel, will gather him, &amp;c. I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoyce from their sorrow, &amp;c. Is Ephraim my dear son, &amp;c? I will surely have mercy on him, saith the Lord, &amp;c. As I have watched over them to pluck up, and to break down, &amp;c. so will I watch over them to build, and to plant, saith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 10, 13, 20, 28.</p>
                  <p>For the Lord will not cast off for ever: but though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies: for he doth not afflict willingly, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 31, 32.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Now will I bring again the Captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and will be jealous for mine holy name, after that they have born their shame, &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. 25, 26.</p>
                  <p>Come let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us: he hath smitten, and he will bind us up, &amp;c. <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
                  <p>Rejoyce not against me, O mine enemy: though I fall, I shall arise, &amp;c. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, &amp;c. he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness, &amp;c. Who is a God like unto thee, who pardoneth iniquity, &amp;c? he retaineth not his anger for ever: because he delighteth in mercy, he will turn again, he will have compassion upon us, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 8, 9, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>Blessed are they who mourn, for they shall be comforted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
                  <p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, &amp;c. but your sorrow shall be turned into joy, &amp;c. ye now therefore have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoyce, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20, 22.</p>

               <p>THE kingdom is the Lords, and he is the governour among the nations, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 28. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
               <p>Against all the gods <hi>(or, Princes)</hi> of Egypt, I will execute judgment, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 12.</p>
               <p>And the Lord said to Moses, Gather unto me seventy of the Elders of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, &amp;c. and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: and they shall bear the burthen of the people with thee, &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 16, 17, 25.</p>

               <p>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust: lifteth the beggar from the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil, to sit among Princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>When the people asked a king, the Lord said to Samuel, &amp;c. For they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 5, 6, 7.</p>

               <p>Promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, &amp;c. but God is the judg: he putteth down one, and setteth up another, <hi>Psal.</hi> 75. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>God, &amp;c. judgeth among the gods, &amp;c. I have said, Ye are gods, &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 1, 6.</p>

               <p>For the transgression of a land, many are the Princes thereof, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 2.</p>

               <p>Blessed be the name of God, &amp;c. he changeth the times and seasons: he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth kings, and setteth up kings, &amp;c. he is a God of gods, and Lord of kings, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 47.</p>

To the intent that the living may know, that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will: and setteth up over it the basest of men, &amp;c.

               <p>O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour, and for the majesty he gave him, all, &amp;c. trembled, &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 18, 19.</p>

               <p>He leadeth away counsellors spoiled, and maketh the Judges fools: he looseth the bonds of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle: he lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty, &amp;c. he poureth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon Princes, and weakneth the strength, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 12. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>

               <p>I have said, Ye are gods, &amp;c. but ye shall dye like men, and fall like one of the Princes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>The kings heart is in the hand of the Lord: as the rivers of water, he turneth it whither he will, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1.</p>

               <p>Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of the poor in his cause, &amp;c. and thou shalt take no gift: for gifts blindeth the wise, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 6, 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 19.</p>

            <p>AND though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more: but thine eyes shall see thy teachers, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 20.</p>
            <p>The Lord said unto Jeremy, Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee: and whatsoever I shall command thee, thou shalt speak. Be not afraid, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>If thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 19.</p>
            <p>The word of the Lord was made a reproach, &amp;c. and a derision daily: then said I, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name: but his word was in mine heart, as a burning-fire shut up in my bones: and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Freely ye have received, and freely give: provide neither gold nor silver, nor brass in your purses, &amp;c. for the workman is worthy of his meat, &amp;c. I send you forth as sheep, &amp;c. be ye therefore as wise as serpents, and harmless as doves, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 7, 8, 9, 10, 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 21.</p>
            <p>Go ye therefore, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and lo I am with you, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>He who speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he who seeketh his glory who sent him, the same is true, &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 18.</p>
            <p>The Apostles were very desirous to do good to the souls of others, and therefore took all occasions possible to preach the Gospel every where, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 13, 14, &amp;c. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 12, 13, &amp;c. <hi>ch.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 29, 30, 31, 42, <hi>ch.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When the Apostles were forbid to preach Christ, they answer, Whether it be right in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judg ye: for we cannot but speak the things we have seen and heard, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>We will give our selves to prayer continually, and preaching of the word, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 4.</p>
            <p>These are the servants of the most high God, who shew unto us the way of salvation, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 17.</p>

Paul being a tent-maker, abode with Aquilla, being of the same craft, and wrought with him, &amp;c. He reasoned in the Synagogue every Sabbath, &amp;c. He testified to the Jews, that Jesus was Christ, &amp;c. Apollos shewing by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that Jesus was the Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 28.</p>
            <p>Paul preached three months, disputing and perswading about the kingdom of God; but when divers were hardned, &amp;c. he separated the disciples, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Paul said, I kept back nothing which was profitable unto you: but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, &amp;c. testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, &amp;c. repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c. neither count I my life dear, so that I might finish, &amp;c. the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testifie the Gospel, &amp;c. I am pure from the blood of all men: for I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God, &amp;c. I have coveted no mans silver, or gold, &amp;c. ye your selves know that these hands have ministred to my necessity, and to them who were with me, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 20, 21, 24, 26, 27, 33, 34, 35.</p>
            <p>The Gentiles to whom I now send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Paul dwelt two years in his own hired house, and received all who came in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 30, 31.</p>
            <p>I thank my God, &amp;c. that your faith is spoken of, &amp;c. without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers, &amp;c. I Iong to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end you may be established, &amp;c. I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ; for it is the power of God unto salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8, 9, 10, 11, 16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, &amp;c. I beseech you brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christs sake, &amp;c. that ye strive together with me in your prayer to God for me, that I may be delivered from them who do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 18, 30.</p>
            <p>When I came to you, I came not in the excellency of speech, or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God: for I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified, &amp;c. and my speech and my preaching was not with inticing <hi>(or, perswasible)</hi> words of mans wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit, &amp;c. which things also we speak, not in the words mans wisdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghost teacheth: comparing spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things with spiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 13.</p>
            <p>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as spiritual, &amp;c. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able, &amp;c. I have plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. but God gave the increase: so then, neither is he who planteth any thing, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Account of us as, &amp;c. stewards of the mystery of God; moreover, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in stewards, that a man be found faithful, &amp;c. Even to this present hour we hunger, &amp;c. and labour, working with our own hands, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2, 11, 12.</p>

Have we not power to eat and to drink, &amp;c? Who goeth to warfare at any time upon his own charge, &amp;c? so the Lord hath ordained, that they who preach the Gospel, should live of the Gospel, &amp;c. but I have used none of these things, &amp;c. wo is unto me if I preach not the Gospel, &amp;c. though I be free from all men, yet have I made my self servant unto all, that I might gain the more: and unto the Jews, I became as a Jew, &amp;c. I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 4, 7, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>I speak as to wise-men, judg ye what I say; the cup of blessing, &amp;c. Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 15, 33.</p>
            <p>In the Church, I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>By the grace of God, I am that I am, &amp;c. I laboured, &amp;c. yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10.</p>
            <p>You also helping together by prayer for us, &amp;c. not for that we have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11, 24.</p>
            <p>If I make you sorry, who is he then who maketh me glad, but the same who is made sorry by me, &amp;c? out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears: not that ye should be grieved, but that, &amp;c. we are not as many who corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2, 4, 17. chap. 4. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Not that we are sufficient of our selves, to think any thing as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God: who also hath made us able ministers, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Commending our selves to every mans conscience in the sight of God, &amp;c. we preach not our selves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and our selves your servants for Jesus sake, &amp;c. We have the same spirit of faith, &amp;c. we believe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore speak, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2, 5, 13.</p>
            <p>Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we perswade men, &amp;c. the love of Christ constrains us, &amp;c. God hath given unto us the ministry of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, &amp;c. We are embassadors for Christ, as though God, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11, 14, 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed; but in all things approving our selves as the ministers of God, in much patience in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in necessities, in distresses, &amp;c. by pureness, by knowledg, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 10.</p>
            <p>We have wronged no man: we have corrupted no man, we have defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no man, &amp;c. though I made you sorry, I do not repent, &amp;c. I do rejoyce, not that you were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance, &amp;c. that ye might receive damage by us in nothing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5.</p>

                  <p>Then the Twelve called the multitude, &amp;c. and said, &amp;c.

                  <p>Jesus, &amp;c. as his custom was, he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and stood up to read: and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaias; and when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, The spirit of the Lord is upon me, &amp;c. and he closed the book, and gave it again to the minister, and sate down, &amp;c. and he began to say unto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears, &amp;c. and all, &amp;c. wondred at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 31, 32.</p>

                  <p>When Paul and his company came to Antioch, he went into the Synagogue, &amp;c. and after the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the Synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the people, say on: Then Paul stood up, and preached, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 13, 14, 15, 16, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Then spake the Lord to Paul, &amp;c. speak, and hold not thy peace, for I have much people in this City: and he continued there, &amp;c. teaching the word of God among them, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>Paul went into the Synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and perswading the things concerning the kingdom of God: but when divers were hardned, and believed not, &amp;c. he separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus, and this continued by the space of two years: so that all they who dwelt in Asia, heard the word of the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 8, 9, 10.</p>

                  <p>And Paul dwelt two years in his own hired house, and received all who came in unto him: preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>I am ready to preach the Gospel, &amp;c. for I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 15, 16.</p>
                  <p>How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they preach except they be sent, &amp;c? so then, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15, 17.</p>
                  <p>Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, &amp;c. for the preaching of the cross is to them who perish, foolishness: but unto us who are saved, it is the power of God, &amp;c.

                  <p>As they were eating, Jesus took bread and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is my body: and he took the cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it, for this is my blood of the new Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins: but he said unto them, I will not drink it henceforth, &amp;c. and when they had sung, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.</p>

                  <p>He sate down, and the twelve Apostles with him, &amp;c. He took the cup and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among your selves, &amp;c.

            <p>John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, he hath a devil; the Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, behold a man gluttonous and a wine-bibber, and a friend of Publicans and sinners, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>When the Pharisees saw the disciples plucking corn on the Sabbath-day, they said, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath-day. Jesus said, Have ye not read, &amp;c. how that on the Sabbath-days, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless, &amp;c? They asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day? that they mighe accuse him, &amp;c. then he cured the man, &amp;c. Then the Pharisees went out and held a council against him, that they might destroy him, &amp;c. They said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of Devils, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 24.</p>
            <p>They said of Christ, Is not this the Carpenters son, &amp;c? whence then hath this man all these things? and they were offended in him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 54, 55, 56, 57.</p>
            <p>Then there came to Jesus Scribes and Pharisecs, &amp;c. saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the Elders, for they wash not their hands when they eat bread? But he answered and said unto them, Why do you also transgress the commandment by your traditions? for God commanded, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Honour thy father, &amp;c. but ye say, &amp;c. thus have ye made the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God of none effect by your tradition: ye hypocrites, well did Isaias prophesie of you, saying, This people draw nigh to me with their mouth, &amp;c. but their heart is far from me, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>The young rich man had observed much of the law; yet when Christ had
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:94934:226"/>
said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor: he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>Those who agreed for wages, murmur, because those who did not agree, nor do so much work as they, had alike wages freely given them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 1, 2, to the 15.</p>
            <p>When the chief Priests and Scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; they were sore displeased, &amp;c. And when he was come into the temple, the chief Priests and the Elders, &amp;c. came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority dost thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? When Christ had put forth the parable of the vinyard, and the chief Priests had heard this parable, they perceived that he spake of them: but when they sought to lay hands on him, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 15, 23, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 45, 46.</p>
            <p>Then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might intangle him in his talk, &amp;c. asked him, Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not, &amp;c? Jesus said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>The Scribes and Pharisees, &amp;c. they say, and do not: for they bind heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and grievous to be born, and lay them on mens shoulders, but will not move them with one of their fingers: but all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and inlarge the borders of their garments, and love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the Synagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men Rabbi, Rabbi, &amp;c. But wo unto you Scribes, and Pharisees, hypocrites: ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in your selves, neither suffer ye them who are entring, to go in, &amp;c. Ye devour widows houses, and for a pretence make long prayers, &amp;c. Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him two-fold more the child of hell, &amp;c. Blind guides! who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing: but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor, &amp;c. Ye pay tythe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith, &amp;c. strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel, &amp;c. Ye make clean the outside of the cup, &amp;c. but within they are full of extortion and excess: ye outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>The chief Priest, and the Scribes, &amp;c. consulted that they might take Jesus and kill him, &amp;c. Judas betrayed Christ with a kiss, &amp;c. The chief priests, &amp;c. sought false witnesses against Jesus, to put him to death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 3, 4, 49, 59.</p>
            <p>Judas said to the high Priests, &amp;c. I have sinned in betraying innocent blood: and they said, What is that to us? look thou to that, &amp;c. they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the multitude to ask Barabbas and destroy Jesus (when the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:94934:226"/>
would have released Jesus); they said, Let his blood be upon us and our children, &amp;c. They mocked him, and said, He trusted in God, let him deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him now, &amp;c. and notwithstanding all the wonders at his death, which made the Centurion say, Truly, this was the Son of God; yet the chief priests, &amp;c. came to Pilate, and said, &amp;c. That deceiver said, &amp;c. desired, and set a watch upon the sepulchre, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 3, 4, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 41, 42, 43, 53, 54, 62, 63, 64, 66.</p>
            <p>When they were convinced that Christ was risen, they gave large money to the soldiers to hide it with a lye, and promised the soldiers to secure them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>But the Pharisees and Lawyers rejected the counsel of God against <hi>(or, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in)</hi> themselves, being not baptized of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 30.</p>
            <p>Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drank in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets: But he shall say, &amp;c. Depart from me ye work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>And he spake this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves, that they were <hi>(or, as being)</hi> righteous, and despised others. Two went up into the temple to pray, the one a pharisee. and the other a publican: the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself; God, I thank thee that I am not as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men are, extortioners, &amp;c. I fast twice in the week: I give tythes, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>

            <p>The chief Priests and Scribes would kill Jesus, &amp;c. Judas offered to betray him; they were glad, and covenanted with him, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 2, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>They accuse Christ before Pilate, saying, We have found this fellow pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cesar, saying, That he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is Christ a king, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>How can ye believe who receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour which cometh from God only? <hi>John</hi> 5. 43, 44.</p>
            <p>Ye seek me not because of the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled, &amp;c. Jesus said, &amp;c. No man can come to me except it were given him of my father. From that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him, <hi>John</hi> 6. 26, 65, 66.</p>
            <p>Some said of Christ, he deceiveth the people: howbeit, no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews, &amp;c. The chief priests and pharisees said unto the officers, Why have ye not brought him? the officers answered, Never man spake like this man; then answered them the pharisees, Are ye also deceived? have any of the rulers or pharisees believed on him? but this people who knoweth not the law, are accursed. Nicodemus said, &amp;c. Doth our law judg any man before it hear him, and know what he doth? And they said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? <hi>John</hi> 7. 12, 13, 45, 46, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52.</p>
            <p>We be Abrahams seed, and were never in bondage to any man, &amp;c. Jesus said, &amp;c. Whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin, &amp;c. Ye seek to kill

me, a man who have told you the truth, &amp;c. this did not Abraham; ye do the deeds of your father, &amp;c. The Jews say, Say we not well, thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil, <hi>John</hi> 8. 33, 34, 40, 41, 48.</p>
            <p>The Pharisees said, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, &amp;c. The Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the Synagogue, &amp;c. They say of Christ, he is a sinner, we are Moses disciples: as for this fellow we know not whence he is, &amp;c. When they were convinced by the man who had been blind, that Christ must be of God; they say to him, Thou wast altogether born in sin, and dost thou teach us? and they excommunicated him, &amp;c. Christ said to the Pharisees, Ye say, you see, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 9. 16, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 40, 41.</p>
            <p>When Lazarus was raised from the dead, the chief priests and the pharisees gathered a council: and said, What do we? for this man doth many miracles: if we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation, &amp;c. from that day forth they took counsel together to put him to death, <hi>John</hi> 11. 44, 46, 47, 48, 53, 57.</p>
            <p>Judas said, Why was not this oyntment sold, &amp;c. and given to the poor? this he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag, &amp;c. The chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to death, because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus, &amp;c. The pharisees therefore said among themselves, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him, &amp;c. Among the chief rulers also many believed on him: but because of the pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the Synagogue: for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God, <hi>John</hi> 12. 5, 6, 10, 11, 19, 42, 43.</p>
            <p>The time cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth God good service, &amp;c. These things they will do, &amp;c. because they have not known the father, <hi>John</hi> 16. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Pilate sought to release Jesus; but the Jews cryed out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Cesars friend: whosoever maketh himself a King, speaketh against Cesar, &amp;c. Pilate said, Shall I crucifie your king? the chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar, <hi>John</hi> 19. 12, 15.</p>
            <p>As the Apostles spake unto the people, the priests and the Captain of the temple, and the Sadduces came upon them, being grieved that they taught the people, &amp;c. and they laid hands on them, &amp;c. said, By what power, or by what name do ye this, &amp;c? They said, What shall we do with these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them, is manifest to all, &amp;c. and we cannot deny it: but that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name; and they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>

the holy Ghost, &amp;c. multitudes were added to the Lord: then the high priests, &amp;c. were filled with indignation, and laid theirhands on them, and put them in the common prison, &amp;c. they doubted whither these things would grow, &amp;c. said to the Apostles, Ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this mans blood upon us, &amp;c. When the Apostles had said, That God had exalted that Jesus whom they slew, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 24, 28, 30, 31, 33. <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 54, 55.</p>
            <p>When they could not resist the spirit and wisdom by which Stephen spake, then they suborned men, who said, We have heard, &amp;c. and they stirred up the people, &amp;c. and they came upon him and caught him, &amp;c. And they set up false witnesses, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Simon when he saw the Apostles through laying on of hands, conferred the holy Ghost; he offered them money for the like power, &amp;c. was in the gall of bitterness, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 18, 19, 23.</p>
            <p>The next Sabbath-day came almost the whole City together to hear the word of God: but when the Jews saw the multitude, they were filled with envy, and spake against the things which were spoken by Paul, contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and blaspheming, &amp;c. but the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the City, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 44, 45, 49, 50.</p>
            <p>The unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evilly affected against the brethren, &amp;c. perswaded the people to stone them, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 2, 19.</p>
            <p>When Paul had preached, and many believed; the Jews who believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the City in an uproar, &amp;c. they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the City, crying, These have turned the world upside down, &amp;c. these do all contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying, That there is another King, one Jesus; the Jews came also to Berea, and stirred up the people, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13.</p>
            <p>The Jews made an insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat, saying, This fellow perswaded men to worship God contrary to the law, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Paul said, I was zealous towards God, as ye all are at this day: and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted this way unto the death, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Certain Jews bound themselves under a curse to kill Paul, &amp;c. the chief Priests and Elders agree to help it forward, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 12, 13, 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 25. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>They get an Orator to accuse Paul, thus: We found this man a pestilent fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the Nazarens: who also hath gone about to profane the temple, &amp;c. When Paul reasoned of righteousness, &amp;c. Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time: when I have a convenient time I will call for thee, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 1, 2, 5, 6, 15.</p>

Paul said, I verily thought with my self, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus, &amp;c. which thing I also did, &amp;c. exceeding mad, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9, 10, 11.</p>

            <p>Behold, thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, and knowest his will, &amp;c. and art confident that thou thy self art a guide to the blind, &amp;c. Thou therefore who teachest another, teachest thou not thy self? Thou who preachest a man shall not steal, dost thou steal, &amp;c?

            <p>Israel who followed after the law of rigteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness: wherefore, because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: for they stumble at that stumbling-stone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31, 32.</p>
            <p>They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledg: for they being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going about to establish their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ: for neither they themselves who are circumcised, keep the law: but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. 12, 13.</p>

               <head>The great danger of Hypocrisie and formality, and end of Hypocrites.</head>
               <p>The hypocrites hope shall perish, whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spiders web: he shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>He also is my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 16.</p>
               <p>The congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 15. 34.</p>
               <p>He who speaketh flattery to his friend, the eyes of his children shall fail, <hi>Job</hi> 17. 5.</p>
               <p>The joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment: though his excellency mount up unto the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds, he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they who have seen him, shall say. Where is he? and he shall flee away as a dream, and shall not be found: the eye also which saw him, shall see him no more, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 20. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What is the hope of the hypocrite when he hath gained, when God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away his soul? will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? <hi>Job</hi> 27. 8, 9.</p>

               <p>Wo unto them who seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark; and they say, Who seeth us? and who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>The sinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulness hath surprised the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, &amp;c. who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire, &amp;c? <hi>Isa.</hi> 33. 14.</p>
               <p>Behold all ye who kindle a fire, who compass your selves about with sparks; walk in the light of your fire, and in your sparks which ye have kindled: this shall ye have of my hand, ye shall lye down in sorrow, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 11.</p>
               <p>I will declare thy righteousness and thy works, for they shall not profit thee, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 12.</p>
               <p>Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, &amp;c. Behold, ye trust in lying words which cannot profit, &amp;c. therefore will I do to this house, &amp;c. wherein ye trust, &amp;c. as I have done to Shiloh, and I will cast you out of my sight, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>I will punish all them who are circumcised, with the uncircumcised. Egypt, &amp;c. all these nations are uncircumcised: and all the house of Israel uncircumcised in the heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the Lord your God, &amp;c. Now therefore know certainly, that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 42. 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>

            <p>AND it came to pass afterwards, that Davids heart smote him, because he had cut off Sauls skirt: and he said unto his men, The Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master the Lords anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>And Davids heart smote him after that he had numbred the people: and David said unto the Lord, I have sinned greatly in that I have done, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 13.</p>
            <p>When Josiah had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his cloaths, &amp;c. and he commanded, &amp;c. Go and enquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, &amp;c. for great is the wrath of the Lord, &amp;c. Tell the man that sent you to me, &amp;c. I will bring evil upon this place, &amp;c. But to the king, &amp;c. because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thy self, &amp;c. thine eyes shall not see all the evil, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>I will not remove mine integrity, &amp;c. my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said, &amp;c. what shall we do? <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37.</p>
            <p>Paul said, &amp;c. I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 1.</p>
            <p>And herein do I exercise my self, to have always a conscience void of offence towards God and towards man, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 16.</p>
            <p>Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts: their conscience also bearing them witness <hi>(or, the conscience witnessing with them):</hi> and their thoughts the mean while <hi>(or, between themselves)</hi> accusing or else excusing one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>I say the truth in Christ, I lye not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy Ghost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
            <p>Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but for conscience sake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience-sake: for the earth is the Lords, &amp;c. If any of them who believe not, bid you, &amp;c. whatsoever is before you, eat, asking no queston for conscience-sake; but if any man say unto thee, this is offered to idols; eat not for his sake, &amp;c. and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science-sake, &amp;c. Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the others: for why is my liberty judged of another mans conscience, &amp;c? Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32. <hi>chap.</hi> 8. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:94934:230"/>
Our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
            <p>By manifestation of the truth, commended our selves to every mans conscience in the sight of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>We are made manifest unto God; and I trust also, are made manifest in your consciences, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
            <p>Now the end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, &amp;c. holding faith and a good conscience: which some having put away, concerning faith have made shipwrack, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. 19.</p>
            <p>Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>The Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, &amp;c. speaking lyes in hypocrisie: having their conscience feared with a hot iron, forbidding to marry, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>I thank God, whom I serve, &amp;c. with pure conscience, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 3.</p>
            <p>Unto them who are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing pure: but even their mind and conscience is defiled, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 15.</p>
            <p>In which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, which could not make him who did the service, perfect as pertaining to the conscience, &amp;c. If the blood of bulls and goats, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: how much more shall the blood of Christ, &amp;c. purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>The law having a shadow of good things, &amp;c. can never with those sacrifices they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect: then would they not have ceased to be offered, because that the worshippers once purged, should have had no more conscience of sins; but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance, &amp;c. Let us draw-near, &amp;c. having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, 22.</p>
            <p>We trust we have a good conscience in all things, willing to live honestly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18.</p>
            <p>This is thank-worthy, if a man for conscience towards God, endure grief, suffering wrongfully, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p>Having a good conscience, that whereas they speak evil of you, &amp;c. Baptism doth also now save us: not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good conscience towards God, by the resurrection of Jesus, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16, 21.</p>
            <p>Let us not love in word, &amp;c. Hereby we know, &amp;c. for if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things: beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 13, 19, 20, 21.</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> Of Satan, the Devil himself.</head>
               <p>NOW the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field, which the Lord God had made: and he said unto the woman, yea, because <hi>(or, hath)</hi> God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? the woman said, &amp;c. We may eat, &amp;c. but of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, left ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die; for God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be open, and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil: and the woman saw that the tree was good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1.</p>
               <p>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord: and Satan <hi>(or, the adversary)</hi> came also among <hi>(or, in the midst)</hi> of them, &amp;c. The Lord said to Satan, From whence comest thou? then said he, &amp;c. from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it, &amp;c. He said, Doth Job serve God for nought? hast thou not made a hedg about him, &amp;c? put forth thine hand, and touch that which he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face, &amp;c. then Satan having leave given him, destroyed all he had, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, to the end. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Hast thou considered my servant Job, &amp;c? still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him to destroy him without a cause. And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin, yea, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life: but put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face; and the Lord said, He is in thine hand, but <hi>(or, only)</hi> save his life. So went Satan, &amp;c. and smote Job, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>And he shewed me Joshua the High-priest standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. And the Lord said

But he answered and said, It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, &amp;c. Then the devil taketh him, &amp;c. and setteth him on a pinacle of the temple, and saith unto him, If thou be the son of God, cast thy self down; for it is written, He shall give his Angels charge, &amp;c. Jesus said, It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten again, &amp;c. The devil, &amp;c. shews him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, and saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me, &amp;c.

Let no man deceive you by any means, &amp;c. that man of sin, &amp;c. who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God, &amp;c. then shall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his coming; whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them who perish: because they received not the love of the truth, &amp;c. for this cause God shall send them strong delusions, that they should believe a lye, that they all might be damned, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>

               <p>Now the Spirit speaketh expresly, that in the latter days some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils: speaking lyes in hypocrisie; having their consciences feared with a hot iron: forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>If any man teach otherwise, &amp;c. he is proud, knowing nothing: but doting <hi>(or, sick)</hi> about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, &amp;c. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth: supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thy self: Some, &amp;c. have erred, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, 21.</p>

               <p>The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their own lusts shall they heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears: and they shall turn away their ears from truth, and shall be turned unto fables: but watch thou, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5.</p>

A Bishop must be blameless, &amp;c. holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught <hi>(or, in teaching)</hi> that he may be able by sound doctrine, both to exhort and convince the gainsayers: for there are many unruly and vain tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucres sake, &amp;c.

Whosoever trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God, &amp;c.

               <hi>CHAP. XXXV.</hi> Of the Resurrection of the Dead.</head>
            <p>SO man lyeth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 12.</p>
            <p>I know my redeemer liveth, &amp;c. and though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for my self: and mine eyes shall behold, and not another, &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 19. 25, 26, 27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 15.</p>
            <p>I shall be satisfied when I awake, with thy likeness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 15.</p>
            <p>Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise: awake and sing ye who dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 19.</p>
            <p>And many who sleep in the dust of the earth, shall awake: some to everlasting life, &amp;c. Thou shalt rest and stand in the lot at the end of the days, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2, 13.</p>
            <p>I will ransom them from the power of the grave: I will redeem them from death; O death, I will be thy plagues: O grave, I will be thy destruction, <hi>Hosea</hi> 13. 14.</p>
            <p>But as touching the resurrection from the dead, &amp;c. I am the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, &amp;c. God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 31, 32. <hi>Luke</hi> 20. 35, 37, 38.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt be recompenced at the resurrection of the just, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 14.</p>
            <p>The hour is coming, in which all who are in the grave shall hear his voyce, and shall come forth: they who have done good, unto the resurrection of life, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 5. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>—I should lose nothing, but raise it up again at the last day, &amp;c. and I will raise him up at the last day, <hi>John</hi> 6. 39, 40, 44, 54.</p>
            <p>I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day; Jesus said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he who believeth, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Because I live, ye shall live also, <hi>John</hi> 14. 19.</p>
            <p>They taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>And when they heard of the resurrection from the dead, some mocked, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 32.</p>
            <p>Of the hope and resurrection of the dead, am I called in question, &amp;c. The Sadduces say, There is no resurrection, &amp;c. The Pharisees confess it, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 6, 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 24. 21.</p>
            <p>They themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just, and unjust, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="456" facs="tcp:94934:244"/>
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead? <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 8.</p>
            <p>The earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God, &amp;c. We our selves groan within our selves, waiting for the adoption: to wit, the redemption of our body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19, 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
            <p>The resurrection of the dead proved at large: and with what bodies, and the manner of the resurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12, 13, to the 56.</p>
            <p>That we should not trust in our selves, but in God who raiseth the dead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
            <p>He who raised up the Lord Jesus, shall raise up us also by Jesus; and shall, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p>The holy spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 30.</p>
            <p>We look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according unto the working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>He is the head, &amp;c. the beginning, the first-born from the dead, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
            <p>I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them who are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others who have no-hope: for if we believe that Jesus dyed and rose again, even so them also who sleep in Jesus will God bring with him: for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, That we who are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who are asleep: for the Lord himself shall descend, &amp;c. and the dead in Christ shall arise first: then we who are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p>Hymeneus, &amp;c. who concerning the truth have erred, saying, That the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
            <p>Not laying again the foundation, &amp;c. of the resurrection of the dead, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35.</p>
            <p>Thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 18.</p>
            <p>I saw the souls of them who were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, &amp;c. and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years: but the rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand years were finished. This is the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: blessed and holy is he who hath part in the first resurrection, on such the second death hath no power, &amp;c. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, &amp;c. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hell <hi>(or, the grave),</hi> delivered up the dead which were in them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4, 5, 6, 12, 13.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. XXXVI.</hi> Of Christs second coming to the Judgment, and rendring unto every man according to his deeds done in the body, whether good or bad.</head>
            <p>SHall not the Judg of all the earth do right? <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 25.</p>
            <p>The wicked is reserved to the day of destruction: they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 30.</p>
            <p>I know my Redeemer liveth, and he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 25.</p>
            <p>The ungodly shall not stand in judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations which forget God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 17.</p>
            <p>God is Judg himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 6.</p>
            <p>He cometh to judg the earth: and he shall judg the world with righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the people with his truth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 96. 13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 98. 9.</p>
            <p>Rejoyce, O young man in thy youth, &amp;c. and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things, God will bring thee into judgment, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 9.</p>
            <p>For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good, or whether it be evil, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
            <p>Thine eyes are upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 19.</p>
            <p>Agree with thine adversary, &amp;c. lest at any time thine adversary deliver thee to the Judg, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, Have we not prophesied in thy name, &amp;c? then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me ye who work iniquity, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>Whosoever shall not receive you, &amp;c. it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that City, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 14, 15. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>But I say unto you, That every idle word which men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36.</p>
            <p>So shall it be at the end of the world: the Son of man shall send sorth his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and they shall gather, &amp;c. them which do iniquity: and shall cast them into a furnace of fire, there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth: then shall the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous shine, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 40, 41, 42, 43, 49, 50.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="458" facs="tcp:94934:245"/>
The Son of man shall come in the glory of his father, with his Angels: and then he shall reward every man according unto his works, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 27.</p>
            <p>There was a man who had not on a wedding-garment; and the king said unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? and he was speechless. Then said the king to his servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 11, 12, 13. <hi>chap.</hi> 25. 30.</p>
            <p>As the lightning cometh out of the East, and shineth to the West: so shall also the coming of the Son of man be, &amp;c. And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn: and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; and he shall send his Angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, &amp;c. But of the day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the Angels in heaven, but my father only: but as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be, &amp;c. they were eating and drinking, &amp;c. Watch therefore, &amp;c. be ye therefore ready also: for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 27, 30, 31, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 12, 35, 36. <hi>chap.</hi> 17. 24.</p>
            <p>When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all his holy Angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on the right hand, but the goats on the left hand. Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand: Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was an hungred, &amp;c. Then shall he say unto them on the left hand, Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Devil and his angels: for I was an hungred, &amp;c. and these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into everlasting life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 31, 32, 33, 35, 41, 42, 46.</p>
            <p>Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right-hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 64.</p>
            <p>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me, &amp;c. in this adulterous and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with his holy Angels, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38.</p>
            <p>The father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, that all men should honour the Son, &amp;c. and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man, &amp;c. As I hear, I judg, and my judgment is just, because I seek not mine own will, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 5. 22, 23, 27, 30.</p>
            <p>He who rejecteth me, &amp;c. hath one who judgeth him: the word I have spoken, the same shall judg him in the last day, <hi>John</hi> 12. 48.</p>
            <p>I will come again and receive you, <hi>John</hi> 14. 3.</p>
            <p>Ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoyce, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 16. 22.</p>
            <p>This same Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 11.</p>

He commanded us to preach unto the people, &amp;c. That it is he who was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God to be the Judg of quick and dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42.</p>
            <p>He hath appointed a day in the which he will judg the world in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given an assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31.</p>
            <p>And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance and judgment to come, Felix trembled, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25.</p>
            <p>After thy hardness, &amp;c. treasurest up unto thy self wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will render to every man according to his deeds: to them who by patient continuing in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, &amp;c. eternal life: but unto them who are contentious, &amp;c. indignation and wrath, &amp;c. upon every soul of man who doth evil, &amp;c. but glory, honour, and peace to every man who worketh good, &amp;c. for there is no respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with God, &amp;c. in the day when God shall judg the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16.</p>
            <p>Is God unrighteous, &amp;c? God forbid: for then, how shall God judg the world? <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Why dost thou judg thy brother, &amp;c? we shall all stand before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat of Christ: for it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, Every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God: so then, every one of us shall give an account of himself to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 23.</p>
            <p>If any man build on this foundation gold, silver, &amp;c. every mans work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it: because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>He who judgeth me, is the Lord; therefore judg nothing before the time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Do ye not know that the Saints shall judg the world, &amp;c? that we shall judg Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad: knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>When Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
            <p>To the end he may establish your hearts, &amp;c. before God, even our father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
            <p>The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>For your selves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night: for when they shall say, peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travel upon a woman with child: and they shall not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape, &amp;c. I pray God your whole spirit, soul and body, may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 23.</p>

It is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them who trouble you: and to you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance of them who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus; who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>We beseech you by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, &amp;c. as that the day of Christ is at hand, &amp;c. except there come first a falling away, and that man of sin be revealed, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3.</p>

            <p>I thank thee, O father, &amp;c. that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes, &amp;c. for so it seemed good in thy sight, &amp;c. No man knoweth who the son is, &amp;c. but the son, and he to whom the son will reveal him, &amp;c. blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>Wo unto you Lawyers: for ye have taken away the key of knowledg; ye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred not in your selves, and them, who were entring in, ye hindred <hi>(or forbad), Luke</hi> 11. 52.</p>
            <p>That servant who knew his Lords will, and prepared not, neither did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. shall be beaten with many stripes: but he who knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47, 48.</p>
            <p>Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, &amp;c. And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them: neither knew they, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>John</hi> 12. 16. <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>chap.</hi> 20. 9.</p>
            <p>He beheld the City, and wept over it, saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace: but now they are hid, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 41, 42.</p>
            <p>Then opened he their understandings, that they might understand the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44, 45.</p>
            <p>He was in the world, &amp;c. and the world knew him not, <hi>John</hi> 1. 10.</p>
            <p>Ye must be born again, &amp;c. Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? Jesus, &amp;c. said, Art thou a master in Israel, and knowest not these things? <hi>John</hi> 3. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink: thou wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship, <hi>John</hi> 4. 10, 22.</p>
            <p>The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? <hi>John</hi> 6. 52.</p>
            <p>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 7. 17.</p>
            <p>I am the light of the world: he who followeth me, shall not walk in darkness,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:94934:252"/>
but shall have the light of life, &amp;c. If ye had known me, ye should have known my father also, &amp;c. When ye have lift up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, &amp;c. If ye continue in my word, &amp;c. ye shall know the truth, &amp;c. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word, <hi>John</hi> 8. 12, 19, 28, 32, 43. <hi>chap.</hi> 14. 7, 9.</p>
            <p>We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is, &amp;c. Jesus said, For judgment came I, &amp;c. that they who see not, might see: and that they who see, might be made blind, &amp;c. If ye were blind, ye should have no sin, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 9. 29, 39, 41.</p>
            <p>He who walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth; <hi>John</hi> 12. 35.</p>
            <p>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them, <hi>John</hi> 13. 17.</p>
            <p>All these things will they do unto you, &amp;c. because they know not him who sent me, <hi>John</hi> 15. 21, <hi>chap.</hi> 16. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>And this is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent, &amp;c. They have known surely that I came out from thee, &amp;c. The World hath not known thee, &amp;c. these have known that thou hast sent me, <hi>John</hi> 17. 3, 7, 8, 24.</p>
            <p>As yet they knew not the Scripture, that he must rise again from the dead, <hi>John</hi> 20. 9.</p>
            <p>Ye denyed the Holy one, &amp;c. and killed the Prince of life; and now brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it: as did also your rulers, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 14, 15, 17.</p>
            <p>When they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, &amp;c. they had been with Jesus, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 13.</p>
            <p>They who dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers: because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the Prophets which are read, &amp;c. they have fulfilled them in condemning him, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 27.</p>
            <p>I found an altar with this inscription, To the unknown God: whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ignorantly worship, I declare, &amp;c. We ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, &amp;c. and the times of this ignorance God winked at: but now commandeth, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 23, 29, 30.</p>
            <p>I verily thought with my self, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9.</p>
            <p>That which may be known of God, is manifest, &amp;c. for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: because when they knew God, they did not glorifie him as God, &amp;c. Even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledg: God gave them up, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21, 28.</p>
            <p>—Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, &amp;c? not knowing that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God leadeth thee to repentance, &amp;c. Thou art called a Jew, &amp;c. and knowest his will, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>The way of peace they have not known, &amp;c. By the law is the knowledg of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 17, 20. <hi>chap.</hi> 7. 7.</p>

We glory also in tribulation: knowing that tribulation worketh patience, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>They have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledg: for they being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Gods righteousness, and going about to establish their own, &amp;c. have not submitted, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>I would not brethren, that ye should be ignorant in this mystery (lest ye should be wise in your own conceits), that blindness in part is happened to Israel, &amp;c. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledg of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out? for who hath known the mind of the Lord? or, who hath been his counsellor? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25, 33, 34.</p>
            <p>That ye may prove what is that good and acceptable will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
            <p>I my self also am perswaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, and filled with all knowledg: able also to admonish one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 14.</p>
            <p>The mystery which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest: and by the Scriptures of the Prophets according to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>In every thing ye are enriched, &amp;c. and in all knowledg, &amp;c. The world by wisdom knew not God, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5, 21.</p>
            <p>I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ and him crucified, &amp;c. We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, &amp;c. which none of the Princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory, &amp;c. God hath revealed them unto us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c. The things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. Now we have received the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things which are freely given to us of God, &amp;c. the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, &amp;c. neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned, &amp;c. Who hath known the mind of the Lord, &amp;c? but we have the mind of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16.</p>

            <p>We know that we all have knowledg: knowledg puffeth up, but charity edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and if any man thinketh he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know, &amp;c. We know that an Idol is nothing, &amp;c. howbeit, there is not in every man that knowledg, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 4, 7.</p>

            <p>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them who are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them who believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel, &amp;c. should shine into them, &amp;c.

            <p>LAban said to Jacob, Wherefore hast thou stollen my gods? <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 30. Jacob said unto his houshold, Put away the strange gods that are among you, &amp;c. And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hands, and all their ear-rings which were in their ears: and Jacob hid them under the Oak, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2, 4.</p>
            <p>I am the Lord thy God, thou shalt have no other god before me: thou shalt not make unto thee any graven Image, or any likeness that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, &amp;c. Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 2, 3, 4, 5, 23. <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>He who sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 20.</p>
            <p>Make no mention of the names of other gods: neither let it be heard out of thy mouth, &amp;c. Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, &amp;c. Thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their Images, &amp;c. Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods, &amp;c. if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 13, 24, 32, 33.</p>
            <p>The people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, &amp;c. we wot not what is become of him. And Aaron said unto them, Break off the ear-rings, &amp;c. and bring them unto me, &amp;c. and he received them at their hands, and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned it with a graving-tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up, &amp;c. Aaron saw it: he built an altar before it, &amp;c. and they rose up early in the morning, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed burnt-offerings, &amp;c. And the Lord said to Moses, &amp;c. Let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, &amp;c. <hi>Exod</hi> 32. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Ye shall destroy their Altars, break their Images, and cut down their groves, for thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord whose name is Jealous, &amp;c. lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, &amp;c. Thou shalt make thee no molten-gods, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. 51, 52.</p>

Ye shall make you no Idols, nor graven-Image: neither rear you up a standing Image <hi>(or, Pillar),</hi> nor set you up any Image <hi>(or, figure)</hi> of stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am the Lord, &amp;c. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 1.</p>
            <p>They called the people unto the sacrifice of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods, and Israel joyned himself to Baal-peor: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 28.</p>

            <p>Neither shalt thou make marriages with them, &amp;c. for they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, &amp;c. Ye shall destroy their altars, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 3, 4, 5, 16, 25.</p>
            <p>Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess, served their gods, &amp;c. you shall overthrow their altars, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Such who should endeavour to draw others to Idolatry, were to be put to death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the Lord thy God, which thou shalt make thee; neither shalt thou set up any Image <hi>(or, statue)</hi> which the Lord thy God hateth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>If any hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded: he shall be stoned, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 2, 3, 5.</p>
            <p>That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods: so should you sin, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 18.</p>
            <p>Ye have seen their abominations, and their Idol-gods <hi>(or, dunghil-gods)</hi> wood, stone, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>They provoked him to jealousie with strange gods, &amp;c. they sacrificed to devils, not to God, to gods whom they knew not, &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 17, 21. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106, 37.</p>

            <p>Their land also is full of Idols: they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made: and the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself, &amp;c. The Idols shall utterly pass away, and they shall go into the holes of the rocks, &amp;c. for fear of the Lord, &amp;c. In that day, a man shall cast his Idols of silver, and his Idols of gold which they made each one for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats, &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 18, 19, 20. <hi>chap.</hi> 31. 7.</p>
            <p>In that day shall a man look to his maker, &amp;c. and he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands: neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the Images, <hi>Isa.</hi> 17. 7, 8.</p>

evil, &amp;c. Behold, ye are nothing <hi>(or, worse than nothing),</hi> and your works of nought: an abomination, &amp;c. their molten-images are wind and confusions, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 7, 23, 24, 29.</p>
            <p>I am the Lord, that is my name; my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven-images, &amp;c. they shall be turned back: they shall be greatly ashamed who trust in graven-images: who say to the molten-images, Ye are our gods, <hi>Isa.</hi> 42. 8, 17.</p>
            <p>They who make graven-images, are all of them vanity, &amp;c. they see not, nor know, that they may be ashamed: Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven-image, which is profitable for nothing? behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed, and the workmen, &amp;c. they shall be ashamed together, &amp;c. The Carpenter, &amp;c. heweth down Cedars, &amp;c. he will take thereof and warm himself: yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread: yea, he maketh a god and worshippeth it: he maketh it a graven-image, and falleth down thereto: he burneth part thereof in fire, &amp;c. and the residue thereof he maketh a god; his graven-image, he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth down and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me, for thou art my God, &amp;c. None considereth in his heart, neither is there know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg or understanding to say, I have burnt part of it in the fire, &amp;c. and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of <hi>(or, that which comes from)</hi> a tree? <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>They shall be ashamed, and also confounded all of them: they shall go to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions together, who are makers of Idols, &amp;c. they have no knowledg who set up the wood of their graven-image, and pray unto a god who cannot save, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 16, 20.</p>
            <p>To whom will ye liken me, &amp;c? they lavish gold out of the bag, &amp;c. hire a Goldsmith, and he maketh it a god: and they fall down, yea, they worship: they bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him and set him in his place: and he standeth, &amp;c. yea, one shall cry to him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble, <hi>Isa.</hi> 46. 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>I have even from the beginning declared, &amp;c. lest thou shouldst say, Mine Idol hath done them: and my graven-image, and my molten-image hath commanded them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 48. 5.</p>
            <p>A people who provoke me to anger continually to my face: who sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick, &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
            <p>Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit, &amp;c. The house of Israel ashamed, &amp;c. saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, thou hast brought me forth, &amp;c. but where are thy gods which thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy Cities, are thy gods, O Judah, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 26, 27, 28. <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Israel is gone up upon every high mountain, and under every green tree: and there playeth the harlot, &amp;c. her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:94934:262"/>
and played the harlot also, &amp;c. committed adultery with stones and with stocks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 6, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Seest thou what they do in the Cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem? the children gather wood, and the fathers kindle a fire: and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men knead their dough to make cakes to the Queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>They are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities: silver spread into plate, &amp;c. but the Lord is the true God, &amp;c. The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth, they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens, &amp;c. every founder is confounded by the graven-image: for his molten-image is falshood, and there is no breath in them: they are vanity, and the work of errors, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause rain? <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 22.</p>
            <p>The Gentiles shall come, &amp;c. and say, Surely our fathers have inherited lyes, vanity, and things wherein is no profit: shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods? <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Then all the men who knew that their wives had burnt incense unto other gods: and all the women who stood by, &amp;c. answered Jeremy, saying, &amp;c. We will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the Queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the Cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty, &amp;c. so the Lord could no longer bear, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>I am broken with their whorish heart which have departed from me, and with their eyes which go a whoring after their Idols, &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
            <p>These men have set up their Idols in their hearts, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them, &amp;c? I the Lord will answer him according to the multitude of his Idols, &amp;c. I the Lord will answer him by my self, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Hosea</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>The unsatiable idolatry of Jerusalem, with all nations, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 15, 16, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen: because thou art polluted with their Idols, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 30.</p>
            <p>Such of the Levites who had offered before Idols, God refused afterwards, that they should offer any more unto him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>The Image of Nebuchadnezzar set up, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms have caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God; they sacrifice upon the top of mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under Oaks, &amp;c. Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone, <hi>Hosea</hi> 4. 12, 13, 17.</p>
            <p>Of their silver and their gold have they made them Idols, that they may be cut off: thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off: mine anger is kindled, &amp;c. The

            <p>According to the multitude of his fruit, he hath increased the altars: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the goodness of his land, they have made goodly Images: their heart is divided: now they shall be found faulty; he shall break down their altars: he shall spoil their Images, <hi>Hosea</hi> 10. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten-images of their silver, and Idols according to their own understanding; all of it the work of the crafts-men: they say of them, Let the men who sacrifice, kiss the calves: therefore they shall be as the morning-cloud, &amp;c. <hi>Hosea</hi> 13. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>For their Idols have spoken vanity, and the Diviners have seen a lye, and have told false dreams, &amp;c. <hi>Zechar.</hi> 10. 2.</p>
            <p>Judah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord, which he loved <hi>(or, ought to love)</hi> and hath married the daughter of a strange god, <hi>Malachi</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>The people said, &amp;c. The gods are come down unto us in the likeness of men: and they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius; because he was the chief speaker: Then the priest of Jupiter, &amp;c. brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people: which when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul heard of, they rent their cloaths, and ran in among the people, crying out, and saying, Sirs, What do ye in these things? We are also men of like passions with you, and preach unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God who made heaven and earth, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18.</p>
            <p>We write unto them, that they stay from the pollutions of Idols, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 20, 29</p>
            <p>Paul, &amp;c. at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him, when he saw the City wholly given to Idolatry <hi>(or, full of Idols):</hi> therefore disputed he in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, &amp;c. Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious: for, as I past by and beheld your devotions <hi>(or, gods whom ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship),</hi> I found an altar with this inscription, To the unknown God: Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, &amp;c. Forasmuch then as we are the off-spring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art, or mans device, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 16, 17, 22, 23, 29.</p>
            <p>Demetrius said, This Paul hath perswaded and turned away much people, saying, That they be no gods which are made with hands: so that not only this our craft is in danger, &amp;c. but also, that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth, &amp;c. Great is Diana of the Ephesians, &amp;c. the Image which fell down from Jupiter, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 26, 27, 28, 34, 35.</p>
            <p>When they knew God, they glorified him not as God, &amp;c. but became vain in their imaginations, &amp;c. and changed the glory of the invisible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, &amp;c. who changed the truth of God into a lye, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21, 23, 25. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
            <p>Thou who abhorrest Idols, dost thou commit sacriledg? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 22.</p>

               <pb n="493" facs="tcp:94934:263"/>
We know that an Idol is nothing in the World, and that there is none other God but one: for though there be that are called gods (whether in heaven or earth), as there be gods many, and lords many: but to us there is but one God, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Neither be ye Idolaters, as were some of them: as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play, &amp;c. My dearly beloved, flee from Idolatry, &amp;c. What say I then, that the Idol is any thing? or that which is offered in sacrifice, is any thing? but I say, That the things which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 7, 14, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carryed away unto these dumb Idols, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2.</p>

            <p>And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and Idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood, which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 20.</p>

            <p>And there came two Angels to Sodom at even, &amp;c. and Lot seeing them, rose up to meet them: and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground, &amp;c. but the men put forth their hands, and pulled Lot into the house, &amp;c. and they smote the men who were at the door, with blindness, &amp;c. And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any beside? son in law, &amp;c? for we will destroy this place, &amp;c. The Angels hastned Lot, &amp;c. and while he lingred, the men laid hold upon his hand, &amp;c. When they had brought them out abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life, &amp;c. And Lot said unto them, O not so, my Lord, &amp;c. And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing, &amp;c. Then the Lord rained upon Sodom, and upon Gomorrah, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24.</p>

And the Angel of the Lord went farther, and stood in a narrow place, &amp;c. and when the ass saw the Angel of the Lord, she fell down under Balaam, &amp;c. Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the Angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face, &amp;c.

               <hi>CHAP. XLIV.</hi> Of the Kings of Israel and Judah: How they came to their Power and Office.</head>
            <p>GIdeon had judged Israel: he had seventy sons. Abimelech one of the sons of Gideon by his servant (by subtilty with the men of Shechem, that it was better one should reign than all the seventy sons), procures mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, hires vain and light persons, and kills all his brethren (except Jotham the youngest, who hid himself). Abimelech by the men of Shechem and the house of Millo, made King. After a few years he was slain by a piece of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone a woman threw down on him: after whom Judges governed a long time, till Samuel, <hi>Judges</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Israel by the Elders came to Samuel, and said, Make us a King to judg us, like all the nations: and though God was displeased at it, and said, They had rejected not Samuel, but God himself, that he should not reign over them: yet he bids Samuel hearken unto them, and make them a King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Samuel, before Saul came, was told of God of his coming: and that he should be the man whom he should ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>nt king. Samuel anoints him king accordingly, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. <hi>chap.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>According to this afterwards, all the people went to Gilgal: and there they made Saul king before the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Samuel said to Saul, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed thee king over Israel, &amp;c?
