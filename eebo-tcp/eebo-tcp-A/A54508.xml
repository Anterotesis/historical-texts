            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>How <hi>Mr. Peters</hi> being belated on a Journey, lodged at a Millers house, and what passed between him and the Miller.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Peters</hi> being on a Journey inquired of a Miller whom he saw standing on his Mill, where he might have a lodging for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and conveniencie for his Horse; the Miller answered, <hi>He knew no place thereabout:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Peters</hi> travelled on his way, till he came to a little house, which appeared to be the Millers; there he knocks, the good woman coming to the door, Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> desired lodging; she told him she had but one bed in the house, and therein lay her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and her self, but if he would be content with clean straw in the Barn, he might. Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> accepted the proffer, and betakes himself to the Barn, where he had not lain long, but through a small cranny, he spies a man with a bottle of Wine and a Capon; which was no sooner brought, but immediately a good fire was made, and down thereto it went; anon knocks the Miller, all the while the Dame was sore affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and presently conveys away the Capon on the spit, puts out the fire, hides her friend in a kneading Trough, and then opened the door for her husband. The good man being weary, betakes himself to rest; which Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> seeing, bethought how he might be master of that Capon; and to effect it, leaving the Barn, he comes to the house door, knocks, and straight there appears the Miller: <hi>Honest Friend,</hi> quoth Mr. <hi>Peters, I enquired of you for a lodging, but you knew of none, therefore I am content with this Barn; but being exceeding hungry, I desire you to refresh me with what you have, I shall content you to your own desire.</hi> Indeed, quoth the Miller, I have nothing but a brown Loaf, and a piece of Suffolk Cheese, you are welcome to that, and so opens the door. Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, said, <hi>Now my friend, what if I should try a conclusion for some victuals, thould'st not be angry, wouldst thou?</hi> I angry, no in truth, Sir, not I, quoth the Miller. With that, quoth <hi>Hugh, When I was a Youth I could conjure, and I think I have not forgot:</hi> So uttering some barbarous words, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king strange figures with his fingers, saith he, <hi>Look in such a place, and see what there is.</hi> Oh Sir, quoth the Miller, I pray do not conjure, I dare
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37235:3"/>
not do as you command me: Prethee, saith Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> do so as I say, and fear not, we shall have good chear anon. By these perswasions the Miller was wrought upon, He looks, and finds a goodly Capon piping hot, which he brings forth: To this they both fall to; but <hi>Hugh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the smallness of the Millers drink, would needs conjure again: so doing as before, He bid the Miller look in such a place, which he did, and there found a bottle of Wine: This they drank, the Miller admiring, and believing wicked <hi>Hugh</hi> to be a Conjurer; who said, <hi>What if I should shew thee the Devil that brought these good things?</hi> Oh (quoth the Miller) for Gods sake, Sir, forbear, I never saw the Devil yet, and I would not see him now. Nay, saith Mr. <hi>Peters, Do you do, as I I shall instruct you, and you need not fear; stand in the next Room, and when I stamp, then come forth.</hi> With much perswasions he went in; being gone, <hi>Peters</hi> steps to the Trough, wherein the kind Devil had hid himself; and uncovering it, saith he, <hi>Go your ways, and be glad you scape so.</hi> Out goes the man, and Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> then stamps with his foot: whereupon presently appears the Miller. <hi>Look,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Peters, see you where the Devil goes?</hi> Good God, replyed the Miller, if you had not said it was the Devil, I durst have sworn it had been the Parson of our Parish. <hi>As indeed it was.</hi>
