            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Meanewhile, hee heard within a rumour of great blowes, as if many Knights were in fight togither. For after the Prince parted from his cooſen, he went forwards through the Caue, beating his head againſt the walles on euery ſide, till he had paſſed that great darkneſſe, that hee founde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a Hall, where he ſawe a huge Piller, with certaine <hi>Arabian</hi> letters, which hee going to reade, by the light that procéeded from a Window thereby, was forbidden it by a moſt deformed Giant, that ſéeing himſelfe before (hauing in his hande bounde with a mightie Chaine, the monſtrous Beare cauſer of his comming thither) with a terrible ecchoing ſound of his hearſe voyce, thus ſpake.</p>

For he certainely thought that if they were deuoured by wilde beaſts, ſome ſigne thereof would bée founde, ſo that perſwading himſelfe the contrarie, he parted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to reſt, but hee had not ſlept ſcarſe two houres, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly he awaked at the loude cryes he heard, that all the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies ecchoed with the noyſe, which with more vehemence ſtill ſeemed to increaſe, as if they procéeded from ſome in great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie ſuſtaining outrage: whereat the good Emperour was ſo amazed, with trouble on all ſides, chéefely at that time, yet as one ſearching ſuch daungers, commanded <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> to bridle his horſe, while he laced on his helme, and caſting his ſhéeld at his back, mounted on his horſe, not ſetting foote in ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop, and taking his launce, thruſt himſelfe through the groue, following the voyce he heard, imagining ſome of the Princes might be there: but féeling himſelfe wearie with much trauel, yet ſuppoſing he approached euerie foote nigher to the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crie, ſpied hard by him a high Caſtle, well fortified with Towers, though by the darkeneſſe of the night he could little diſcerne it.

So the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour finding no other entrie, bade <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> vnarme him, who ſayde, what meane you to doo my good Lord? will you by force haue your enterance through theſe ſtonie walles?

I intend nothing elſe (replied the Emperour) and therefore alight and vnarme me: which done, binde my Armour to this coard, that therewith, if I haue tune, I may Arme my ſelfe aloft. I thinke it a méere madneſſe (ſaide the Prince) to hazard your perſon in ſo imminent a danger: for beſides that, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I can do no otherwiſe (anſwered the Emperour) for it would be imputed to my euerlaſting ſhame, if I ſhould ſuffer this wrong to paſſe vnpuniſhed, or not vſing that which my ſtate bindes me to. So diſmounting, hee was diſarmed, and getting holde of the rope, taking with him his ſword and ſheelde, he clymed thereby to the Caſtle top, as eaſily as if he had gone vp a paire of ſtayres, and calling for his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, <hi>Don Brianell</hi> began to tye it to the corde. But it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fell out then he imagined: for through the Caſtle gallerie, he ſawe aboue ten Knights, purſued by two moſt fearefull gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and ten other knights that laid on them great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie blowes: which the Emperour ſéeing, and wanting time to arme himſelfe, imbraced his ſtrong ſhéeld, and oppoſed himſelfe againſt the Giants, calling aloud vnto the Knights, they ſhuld turne, and not cowardly flie for feare. They being aſtonied with their ſhame, ſéeing a knight without Armour haue the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt ſuch an enterpriſe, returned againſt the furious Gyant, who with fretting yre, to ſée that one onelie man ſhuld reſiſt their furie, ſet vppon him with great battel-axes in theyr ſtrong hands. But hee whoſe heart neuer feared their deedes, with an vndanted mind ſtayed for them, and making one looſe his blowe, receiued the others on his ſhéelde, which was ſuch, that parted in two, it fell to the ground, hardly ſauing his hand from following it, yet was it a little wounded. Whereat full of rage, he ſtrooke one of them on the head, that the ſword being of a good temper, and gouerned by ſo puiſſant an arme, it cleft it downe to the eyes, wherewith he fell with ſuch violence, as when a tower is ouerturned by the furie of a ſuddaine earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4771:13"/>
hereupon the other ourreached him with his axe, that had he not warded it with his ſword, it had bin the laſt he ſhuld receiue, for it deſcended with ſuch rigour, that his ſword was cut in two, and he wounded pitiouſly on the head: who then ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe in ſuch danger, cloſed ſtraight with the Giant, that not able to ſhunne him, they both tooke holde of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers armes, demeaning themſelues ſo valiantly, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with the ſurpaſſing ſtrength he vſed, loſt much bloud by his wounds, which at length made him (being furiouſly moued) hoyſt his enemie in the aire, and threw him to the ground, euen in the place where he came vp, and quickly puſhing him with his hands, tumbled him headlong ouer the Tower, that with the fall he died: yet leaſt he might reuiue, looking out of a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, he called to <hi>Don Brianell</hi> to kill him afore he aroſe, who ſtraight cutte off his head. By this time the cleareneſſe of the morning beganne to ſhewe it ſelfe, when the Emperour looking towardes the flying Knights, perceiued them to bee put to the worſt, by reaſon of one whoſe valour excelled the reſt, ſeeming to bee of high deſcent, and theyr commaunder, which the Emperour ſéeing, tooke one of the dead Giants ſhéeldes, meaning to reſcue them, whereat the knight turning to him to ſee where he hadde left the Giants, for beeing buſie in fight with the knights, little thought they ſhould haue ſuch fortune, and ſeeing that horrible Giant dead, and howe the Knight made againſt him, reſted amazed, yet with great furie taking his ſword with both handes, made towards the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, which rayſing aloft, gaue him ſuch a blow on the ſheeld, that it made him bowe to the ground, and doubling with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the other ſide thereof, ſtrooke cleane from his arme, ſorely wounding him on the thigh, which the Emperour thought he had loſt, that with mortall furie gaue ſuch another on the right arme, that the greateſt part thereof he cutte, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the knight to take his ſword in his left hande, who with it would wounde him, but the Emperour that had learned to omitte no occaſion, ſuſtaining himſelfe on his thigh, as well
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4771:13"/>
as he could ſtrooke at him ſo fierce a blow, which lighting on his hard tempered helme, it felde him almoſt dead to the grounde: yet greatly prayſing him for that hee hadde ſéene him doo (though he much had endaungered him) would not any otherwiſe hurt him, but going to ſuccour the knights of the Caſtle, ſawe they hadde valiantly reſiſted their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſo ſéeing euerie thing accompliſhed to his deſire, knée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and rendered God great thankes for his deliuerie from ſo great daunger, béeing the greateſt hee euer had béene in, finding himſelfe vnarmed. But going to riſe, was not able to ſtande on his legges, though hee greatly ſtirred to doo it, by reaſon of his wounde, which by that time was colde. And turning to them of the Caſtle, that alreadie had ſlaine their enemies, who extreamely greeuing ſo to ſée him, would vncloath him to cure his woundes. But hee would not, till firſt they called his Page that remained without, which they did, wonderfully amazed at the haughtie courage of the knight, that ſo admirable and vnheard of déedes had done, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to ſuch a place vnarmed, which they iudged to be the greateſt acte that euer was ſpoken of. And calling <hi>Don Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anell,</hi> they tolde him what the Knight would haue, who verie ioyfull becauſe they tolde him hée was in no daunger of death, ſtraight mounted vppe the Caſtle ſtayres, where the Emperour was, greatly doubting his life, by reaſon he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſed that aduenture without armour, and went to the place where they vncloathed him, &amp; there dreſſed his woundes: which done, hée kneeled downe, demaunding his royall hands to kiſſe them. The Emperor imbraced him, and made him riſe: to whom <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> ſayd. Great was the feare that I was in for you my moſt excellent Lord, in that I was barred from bringing you your armor, ſeeing you run into ſo certaine perill, yet thinke I more eaſily you tumbled downe the Giant, then you did your ſelf mount vp vnto the top, giuing him no leiſure to vſe the rope for his eaſier deſcent. The Emperour much delighted in his pleaſant ſpéech, and commanded them to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4771:14"/>
leaue him alone to reſt his tyred bodie, which the knight did, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> with them, and deſired him they might knowe who his maiſter was, and his name, aſſuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, the whole earths circuit coulde not affoord his like for valour, and what chaunce had at ſuch time brought him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>To whom <hi>Don Brianell</hi> anſwered, hee was called the vnknowne knight: and though he had a long time accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, he knew no other name he had, and that trauailing ouer theſe mountaines, he heard the great cries within the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, with what elſe happened. So leauing their diſcourſe, and thinking it time, went to ſerue the Emperour meate, whome they found more quiet (the paine of his woundes beeing mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated) and after he had eaten, demanded the occaſion that thoſe Gyants ſo vſed them. We know not good ſir (anſwered they) ſaue how a knight that came with them, knocked the laſt night at the Caſtle gate, intreating vs to let him in, requiring a lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for that night, which we yéelding to, opened the gate, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting nothing leſſe, then that which befell: but in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening, he ſet vpon vs with thoſe pittileſſe Gyants, whom you ſlew. And when we ſawe ſo many inconueniences, ſent forth thoſe cryes, togither with many women that were within. This (good ſir) is all that we know of this aduenture: ſo that if you had not come when you did, we had all ſuffered a moſt cruell death.</p>

dreſſed his wounds, who though hee had loſt much bloud, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med couragious, as if he were at libertie. And after they had dreſſed him, he was conuaied to a faire Chamber, prouiding him with all neceſſaries, as the Emperour had commaunded. Who in this order remained tenne dayes in the cure of his wounds: when remembring the taſke hee had vndertooke, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to depart thence, went firſt to viſite the wounded Knight, whom he found greatly amended of his woundes: and approching to his bedde ſide, aſked him howe he felt himſelfe.

It pleaſeth mée (replyed the Emperour) conditionally, you alſo let me knowe yours, with the cauſe of your comming hither, with the truth thereof, whereto ſuch a Knight as you is bound.</p>
               <p>I am deſirous to know you (ſaid the Knight) that though it be agaynſt the promiſe I haue made, and you promiſing mée to kéepe it ſecrete, I will not denie it. Thereto I giue you my falth (aunſwered the Emperour) and firſt knowe, I am Don Bellaneo, Emperour of Gréece, that by certaine aduenture, not farre from hence, I parted from my traine, the reſt hauing happened, as you haue ſéene. Ho immortall Gods (ſaide the Knight) fetching a great ſigh: are you he, whoſe name is ſo fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among all the Pagan nations? and he that neuer refuſed to aſſault ſo terrible and fierce Giants? And in bréefe, he whoſe inuincible minde ſheweth howe true the euerlaſting fame of your perpetuall deeds is? and through the world of you is ſpred? Ho great Soldan, now by this dayes ſucceſſe, thy determined purpoſe is vtterly made voide, hauing ſo ſtrong an aduerſarie left thee in the world. It therfore behoues thée no more to think

Suppoſing (renowmed Prince) the matter I ſhall diſcloſe, to be of leſſe conſequence then it is, I wil in few words vnfold the truth thereof, though in the doing of it, to my ſelfe more then to any reſulteth greateſt loſſe. I know that your name (ſo fearefull among all Gentiles) beeing publiſhed in the Soldan of <hi>Siconias</hi> court, with the great deſtruction by you made of his people, and in all Paganiſme, moued him by promiſe to bind himſelfe to giue the one halfe of his dominions with the mariage of his daughter, to that knight, by whoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour your head were brought him. Alſo promiſing, that if in the enterpriſe he died, the halfe of his ſaid dominions ſhould not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding be granted to his ſucceſſiue heires, So I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great promiſe the Soldan had made, and greatlie louing his daughter, reſolutely reſolued, I departed to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Antioch,</hi> whereof I am Lord, and with my ſelfe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing determined what I ought to do, I left my court, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with 500. knights, and 30. giants, purpoſing at your comming out of your palace, either to kill or impriſon you: ſo ſhipping our ſelues, and landed not farre from hence, left our ſhips at anchor, thither to returne with your conqueſt. And that this we might better compaſſe, vnknowne, and vnſéene, we agréed to take this Caſtell. and here remaine till occaſion were offred vs to effect this pretence, being informed of the ſtate of all things by a man whom on the coaſt we tooke, whereby wee hither came, as you haue heard, and eaſily thought to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, being minded to let none ſuruiue to carry the newes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: but your incomparable valour hath fruſtrated our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Thus haue I declared vnto you all that in this caſe I can, whereto your great bountie, &amp; magnanimous clemencie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me: for notwithſtanding I had ſo maſſacred your ſubiects, you cauſed me thus to be cured. My name is <hi>Don Gallaneo</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> if you euer heard of me before: and ſo he made an ende to his ſpéech. The Emperour reſted wonderfull amazed,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4771:15"/>
ſéeing with what audacity <hi>don Gallaneo</hi> had diſcouered him a déed of ſuch waight, for which he might greatly fear his deſerued puniſhment: but iudged him of hauty courage, conſidering how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently he had put himſelf in his hands, hauing againſt him committed ſo high treacherie: and ſhewing no maner of altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made him this anſwer. Truly Prince <hi>Don Gallaneo,</hi> you haue plainly expreſſed the valiancie of your minde, in ſo openly bewraying that, which by any other meanes I could not haue knowne, whereby you haue doubled the cauſe of my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie thoughts, ſéeing in ſuch a knight ſo little ſhame, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further conſideration. ſhould by treaſon ſéeke to ſpill my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, which in ſo great a Prince as you, ſéemeth more odious then in any other, being by order of knighthoode, bound to be vertuous, and abhore all ſuch deteſtable actions, and to be an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to your ſubiects, leaſt againſt your ſelfe they might commit the like. Yet would I not for all my ſtate, you ſhoulde haue had ſuch confidence in mee, ſo to diſcouer my ſelfe, that I might (not knowing it) let your owne ſelfe, ſée your ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in your own imaginations. But ſéeing it is done, here you ſhall remaine in this Caſtel, till I further determin of your being. Yet for all this (ſaid <hi>Don Gallaneo</hi>) aſſure your perſon, for not farre hence is the remainder of my power, and eaſilie may you incurre ſome greater daunger, though your perſon be ſuch as I haue tried: yet among them are ſo fierce and mightie Giants, that will not thinke much to cleaue your bodie armed in two, with one blow.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is recorded by <hi>Friſton,</hi> that the Prince <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> with his Cooſen <hi>Arſileo,</hi> remained ten dayes in the Damzels caue, till the Prince was able to trauaile, who gréeuing much for the ſorrowe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and Empreſſe would ſuſtaine, and acknowledging how much bound he was to that Ladie, determined to depart, yet greatly deſired to know the end of that aduenture. Wherefore the prince <hi>Arſileo,</hi> a day before their departure, intreated her to declare vnto them the whole occaſion of her being in the Caue, and what ſhe would require them to do in her ſeruice: although they néeded not make many offers, being as they were ſo bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to her for ſo many fauors, that at her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand without intreaty, they ought to do, euen with the hazard of their liues. The dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell with a ſorowfull countenance, as one that remembred her forepaſſed miſfortunes, could not withhold her teares, but with watry chéeks, &amp; eies like flowing ſprings with ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning ſtreams, at laſt thus began. I cannot (excellent Princes) ſo intirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe vnto you the cauſe of my griefe, as I could deſire, for the great ſorrow my gréeued heart ſuſtaines, ſuddenly ſuppreſſing me, &amp; breaking into a ſalt ſhower of briniſh teares, will not giue place vnto the exact vtterance of my wordes, yet as I may I will do it. I was (moſt noble Princes) daughter vnto <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peiano,</hi> (not long ſince king of <hi>Antioch</hi>) and am called <hi>Auro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> that being at the Soldan of <hi>Babylons</hi> court, accompanying his daughter, the moſt beautifull <hi>Florisbella,</hi> whoſe perfected beauty, &amp; abſolute vertues, ſo far ſurpaſſeth al other of her time, as doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſun al leſſer ſtars, To this court came a knight whoſe

name for a long time was not knowne, ſauing by certaine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in his ſhéeld, was called the knight of the thrée images, who ſhewed himſelfe ſo valiant, that there was no ten knights in the whole Court ſo ſtrong and hardie, as durſt maintaine the field againſt him. This Knight throughout the Soldanes Empire, performed ſuch déedes of haughtie proweſſe, that in generall, among all men he was accounted a ſecond <hi>Mars,</hi> and the Soldane did no leſſe eſteeme of him, alwayes hauing him in his companie, whereby he thought himſelfe worthie of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dignities, and ſo became amorous of the diuine <hi>Florisbella,</hi> for whoſe loue a long time he ſuffered great gréefe and much ſolitude, not daring to manifeſt it to any: at length ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preuaile to expell that deſire, when one day the Soldane with all his Court was gone a hunting, he remained alone in the Pallace, and after ſome pleaſant diſcourſes, diſcouered vnto me the ſecrets of his loue, intreating me that in his name I would intreate the princeſſe to accept him for her knight, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhée finding her ſelfe agreeued, aunſwered that by no meanes ſhe would do it, commanding him no more to imagine any ſuch madneſſe, leaſt the Soldane her father ſhould by chaunce heare thereof, which if he did, it might coſt him little leſſe then his life. But he nothing weighing this her anſwere, found meanes that the Princeſſe might know the extreame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his perplexed heart, inthralled by her beautie, ſo that I thinking that ſome harme might thereby inſue, declared it to the Soldane, who thereupon commaunded him to depart his Empire, but he not knowing the occaſion, very heauily before his departure, told him that what he did was againſt reaſon, in commanding him to leaue his Dominions, for he was a prince able to ſhew him, that ſuch as he ought not to be ſo vſed. And departing the Court towards the Soldane of <hi>Siconia,</hi> called the great Sophi of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where ſuſpecting I was cauſe of his exile, beganne with fire and ſword to enter the king my fathers territories, in ſuch ſort waſting and ſpoyling them, that ſlaying the king, he tooke poſſeſſion of the whole Kingdome, giuing it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4771:17"/>

In which time (not knowing of his ſucceſſe) I went from the Soldanes Court home to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; fearing to fall in their hands, by counſell of a wiſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called <hi>Bellona,</hi> entred in a boate with theſe Damſels you here ſée, togither with the ſayde woman, and by hir direction ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in this countrey, and was by her conducted to this caue, where ſhe bad me remain, for I ſhould quickly be deliuered by the Prince of <hi>Greece,</hi> and his coſin of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> foretelling me euery thing that hitherto hath happened, and moreouer ſhe bad me giue you armor and horſes, (which here ſhe left) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you ſhall be knighted by a ſtrange aduenture, but what it it was ſhe would not tell. Thus haue I declared the occaſion of my being here: and the fearefull Beare the wiſe woman here left, was hither to bring the Prince <hi>Arfileo</hi> as you ſawe, and the mightie Giant which you ſlew, remayned keeper of the caue, who might not be ſlaine with any weapon but the ſword which you drewe out of the Piller that hee guarded.

               <p>Which was written in Arabian letters, that the Prince well vnderſtood.

Theſe knights of the caſile led with them a man on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe vnbooted &amp; vnſpurde, and his head muſled like a priſoner which made the prince deſirous to know what they were.

who approaching, were greatly amazed to ſée that ſlaughter of knights and Giants, which if their knights that fled had not told them of, they would not haue beléeued it. Hereupon two of the formoſt Giants with a coſin of <hi>Don Gallaneo</hi> called <hi>Don Galfeo</hi> the vnknown, thinking to ouerrun them with their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, perceiued they defended themſelues with <hi>don Gallanco:</hi> wherfore they commanded all their knights to alight on foote, which they would by no means do, becauſe they ſaw comming from the citie a great troupe of knights, which ſo ſoone arriued, as had they alighted, with little trouble they had al bin ſlain, yet notwithſtanding ſome ten of them diſmounted together, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king account to end y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fight with the emperors death, while the reſt went againſt the knights y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> from the citie marched: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſtrange land, they reputed euerie one their enemie.

But finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe incompaſſed with death, began to ſtrike on euery ſide, that vnhappie was hee on whom any lighted, for ſo fearefull and deadly they were, that with ſixe blowes he ſtrooke down thrée knights and two Giants, &amp; ſeeing <hi>Don Galfeo</hi> was hee that moſt moleſted him, ſtrooke at his leg with ſuch ſtrength, that had the ſword fallen with the edge downeright, it had cutte it cleane off, yet it raſed away all his armour there, and ſéeing him within his reach, plucked his ſhéelde out of his hande, and with it beate him to the grounde from himſelfe and ſo none daring moleſt him, without ſetting foote on ſtirrop, hee mounted on <hi>Don Galfeos</hi> horſe.

               <p>The Emperour being about to reply, the king of <hi>Hungary</hi> came to them that returned from purſuing his enemies, to whom the Emperorſaid: it behoueth you king of <hi>Hungary</hi> to conſtraine theſe knights to abide with vs, for I cannot intreat it: They will not doo ſo I am ſure (anſwered the king) eſpecially at your requeſt. I ſay I cannot obtaine it, ſaid the Emperour, yet haue they tolde mee newes of my ſonne, and yours, and that it is not long ſince they departed away from them, and for all this will they not tell me theyr names. They are altogither ſo vnwoorthy to be knowne ſayd, <hi>Arfileo,</hi> that it is vnneceſſarie to require them. But if it may pleaſe your Maieſtie, we would gladly knowe the cauſe wherefore theſe Knights would haue ſlaine you, though in the beginning, me thought they ment it by vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:4771:26"/>The Emperour thereupon told them the whole occaſion, as is alreadie mentioned, at which inſtant the Princeſſe Aurora comming thither with her Ladyes, and hearing the Emperor name <hi>Don Galaneo,</hi> ſaid to <hi>Don Belianis.</hi> The greateſt part of our enterpriſe (Sir knight were finiſhed, if that traitor were taken. Whereupon they commaunded him to be ſought for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all the field, but could not finde him, yet in the ſearch they met the man that directed <hi>Don Galfeo</hi> to the ſea coaſt: of whome by the ſignes and tokens of their armor, they learned that they had fled from the battell, whereof the Emperour was excéedingly ſorie, to whom <hi>Don Belianis</hi> thus ſpake. Afflict not your ſelfe (dread Lord) about him, for it is the enterpriſe I vndergo by this Ladies commaund, and if I liue, I proteſt and promiſe you, that the firſt time he falles into my hands (though he be before the Soldane his Lorde) to giue him his death. I would not haue you take ſuch paines (ſayde the Emperor) but ouerpaſſing that, lette mee againe intreate you to ſtay the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of your woundes in this Caſtle. Wée may héere abidr no longer (replyed <hi>Don Belianis,</hi> and ſo taking their leaues, (the Prince ſending for his ſhéeld, which was brought him in two peeces) they ſtraight departed, ſo ſorely wounded as may be imagined, for he that had leaſt of them both, hadde aboue twentie verie dangerous wounds, chéefely that which <hi>Arfileo</hi> had on his thigh, and the thruſt that <hi>Don Belianis</hi> had, which ſéemed to penetrate his entrals. In this maner going on their way the ſpace of three miles, aſcended a high mountaine, to find ſome place to dreſſe their woundes, and hauing cut and gathered a great number of branches and boughes, the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels made ſome arbours for the knights, hauing left behind the two olde men, with many others: for ſeeing them fall from their horſes, ſuppoſed them ſlaine in the fight, and with their gownes, towels, and ſcarfes, couered them, and after they had vnarmed them, with ſuch things as they had dreſſed theyr woundes, which were ſo déepe and dangerous, that they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lamented, certainely thinking they could not ſcape death.

And leauing them alone to repoſe their wearied bodies, fold it their Lady, who bitterlie wept for their peril, as if ſhe had ſéene them dead, ſo much ſhee credited her Damſels words, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſkill in that miſterie to be ſingular. But being thus in their laments, they ſawe a chariot comming through the ayre, which ſéemed to be made of white tranſparant Chriſtall of the mount: it was drawne with ſix mightie vgly Griffons that put the Princeſſe and her Ladies in great feare: which chariot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in the place where the knights lay.

hir ſight, imbracing hir, accounting hir no leſſe then if ſhe were her own mother: and turning her ſelf to <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſayde. Now will our affaires (moſt excellent prince) happily procéede, for I tell you this is the ſage <hi>Bellona,</hi> that hath brought vs hither by theſe meanes, ſo that nowe I haue vtterly exiled the feare I conceiued of your woundes. The Princes ſeeing her ſo nigh him, verie louingly imbraced her: the like did <hi>Don Arfileo,</hi> to whome the olde woman ſpake. Lette mee intreate you my good Lorde to alight, that with diligence your woundes may bee cured, together with the other knight your champion, whom I haue within this caue, that with no leſſe neceſſitie then your ſelues I haue hither brought. The Prince recording the Dwarfes words when he mounted the Chariot, demaunded whether it were the Emperour his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No my good lord (ſaid ſhe) for there in no reaſon that in ſo perilous a time he ſhould leaue his Empire, your ſelfe being thence abſent: but it is the Prince <hi>Don Bryanell of Macedon.</hi> Then tell me, ſaid <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> howe remained the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour my Father. Well, luſtie, and merie (replyed ſhee) for hee hath learned whom you were that in the battel aided him.

I am ſorie for it (ſayde <hi>don Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis</hi>) for they wil condemne vs of diſcourteſie. That is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (replyed ſhee) beſides they will not take it in ill parte, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you did it to obſerue your woorde. I pray you (ſayde hee) how was my Father ſo ſoone healed, for vnleſſe I bee deceiued, hee was gréeuouſly wounded. Straight ſhall you knowe it (ſayde ſhee) and leading them through the Caue, ſhe brought them to a Pallace, which they iudged to bee the ſtatelieſt that they euer ſawe, where with helpe of many of the ſages ſeruants, they diſmounted, with whoſe diligent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice they reſted much contented, and beeing layde on rich beddes, the graue. Matron ſayd to them, hauing ſearched their wounds, I could at once cure your wounds, as I did the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and <hi>don Bryanels,</hi> but doo it not becauſe I will
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4771:31"/>
kéepe you heere a few dayes: and aſſure your ſolues you ſhal be ſtraight out of all danger. And then ſhee applyed ſuch oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherewith they felt themſelues greatly comforted and eaſed, as if they had no paine at all. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her that they might ſee the Prince <hi>Don Biyanell.</hi> You ſhall (ſayde ſhe) but firſt reſt a while, for you haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of great néede: and commaunding the windowes to be ſhut, tooke the Princeſſe by the hande, and leauing the knights, led her through a long gallerie, not farre from thence, that reached to another lodging of the ſame making that <hi>don Bellianis</hi> was in, ſo curiouſly wrought, and of ſo rare woork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhippe, that the Ladyes greatly admired it: and entering in another roome, they founde the Prince <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> walking alone, alreadie healed of his woundes, yet hauing loſt much bloud, hee looked verie pale and wanne: for the ſage Matron greatly commiſerating his daunger, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, as heretofore is ſpecified. For when ſhee went to cure the Emperour, ſhee made one of her Damſels to enter ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way vnſéeue, and fetching him thence, brought him thither in a traunce, and for all he was healed with the drinke that <hi>Bellona</hi> gaue him, yet knewe hee not in what place, nor in whoſe power hee was, neither knewe hee whether he was in priſon or at libertie, nor in what ſtate the battell remained, in which hee loſt the Emperour: and ſéeing his woundes whole, was in ſuch a wonder, that almoſt hee perſwaded himſelfe, waking out of a dreame, and ſéeing no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye with whome hee might ſpeake, walked vp and downe the Chamber, ſéeking and deuiſing howe by ſome meanes he might reſolue his confuſed thoughts: and when he ſawe the Princeſſe <hi>Aurora</hi> and her Damſels, with the olde wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man leading her by the hande, hee ſtraight knewe her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for as is ſayde, hee ſawe her before hee and <hi>Arfileo</hi> hadde begunne theyr Combatte: with whoſe ſight hee thought that hee and the Emperour were impriſoned by the knights with whom they had commenced their battell, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4771:32"/>
yet knew he not how that might be, hauing after ſéene them ayded by the Emperour againſt <hi>Don Gallaneos</hi> knights: but ſeeing them ſo nigh him, thought that though hee were in the priſon (as he imagined) yet ought he vſe that behauiour that his ſtate required, and ſéeing they were Ladyes, approached with that courteſie which might beſéeme one accompanied with ſuch knights. And ſhe hauing learned of the olde woman who he was, humbled hir ſelfe at his féete: which he vnable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe, did the like, deſiring her to graunt him her faire handes that he might kiſſe them: but they ſo long ſtriued to ſurpaſſe each other in courteſie, that <hi>Bellona</hi> commanded them to riſe, for their ſtate forbad ſuch ceremonies betwéene them: which they did, though not ſo frée as at firſt, for they reſted greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate either of other, and <hi>don Bryanell</hi> at laſt thus brake ſilence. I do ſo wonder at the maruellous things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſince yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day haue happened me, that I know not if any ſuch haue bin or no, for being with the Emperour my ſoueraigne in battell, wherein I remained ſore wounded, and not knowing the ende thereof, I find my ſelfe at this preſent well and ſtrong, and in this rich and ſumptuous chamber, with whoſe like the whole world cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare, nor yet knew whether I be at libertie or captiue, though vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of ſuch kéepers I ſhuld imagine ſuch reſtraint a greater comfort to my greefe then any I can deſire. Wherefore excellent Ladie, I intreate you if you bee in the ſame caſe my ſelfe am in, as one that I ſuppoſe was preſent at all that befell you would declare it me, and that I may alſo with your fauour knowe the true ſucceſſe of the battell, and what is become of thoſe moſt haughtie knights that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied you, whoſe mighty ſtrength I am ſure the whole earth cannot equall, and for what cauſe am I here kept, whether with or without your will? Whilſt he vttered theſe words the Princeſſe earneſtly viewed him, and remained ſo greatly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his good diſpoſition, (being a verie gallant knight) and ſéeing reaſon willed her to anſwere all his demaunds, thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. Not without cauſe may you be confounded in your own
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4771:32"/>
imaginations (excellent Prince) for I aſſure you, if now you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy your life, it is by your being héere: and though the battell was fought nigh <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at this inſtant you are not ſo neare it, as to the Ryphean mountaines, ioyning vppon the great Cittie of <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> for all which you may thanke this graue Matron that here is with me, ſeeing by her great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you hither were conducted. The knights with whom you in the beginning combatted and came in my companie, are the Prince <hi>Arfileo,</hi> that with you fought, the other, whoſe battell was with the Emperour, is his ſonne <hi>Don Bellianis.</hi> Is it poſſible? oh God, ſayd <hi>Don Bryanell,</hi> that <hi>den Bellianis</hi> ſhould with ſuch glorie principate his haughtie deeds of Chiualrie. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count theſe the leaſt (ſayde <hi>Bellona</hi>) for I tell you neither the Emperour his father, nor any knight this day liuing, may with him compare. Certainely I thinke no leſſe (replied <hi>don Brya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi>) and more then you ſay dare I beleeue of that couragious Prince, hauing ſéene him performe ſuch ſurpaſſing wonders in that one fight. But I beſéech you let me know the ende thereof, and how the Emperour and hee do? The Emperour is well (ſayd ſhe) and the Princes both be in this houſe where you are, though ſore wounded. Now I aſſure you, anſwered <hi>don Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anell,</hi> I account my ſelfe moſt happie that after ſo many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles I heare the moſt contentedſt newes that my perplexed ſoule could wiſh, after the tempeſtous paſſage of a boyſterous ſtorme, with the calme approach of the al-comforting ſunne. Wherfore lette vs without longer ſtay go viſit them, and there may I knowe what elſe happened in this aduenture. Euen when you pleaſe (ſayde <hi>Bellona</hi>) for I know they will no leſſe ioy with your ſight, then you with theirs. So taking him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, they returned the way they came to the chamber, where they left the Princes, and entering it, they found them talking togither of their laſt aduenture. But when the Princes ſaw <hi>don Bryanell,</hi> they would riſe to reuerence him, but hee running to <hi>don Bellianis</hi> beds ſide, bended his knee to the grounde, crauing he might kiſſe his hands. The Prince tooke
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4771:33"/>
him vp, and imbracing, ſo held him a while and ſaid. I do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reioyce, renowmed Prince, to ſée you ſo well, though accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your great déedes, in the battell whereby you got many dangerous wounds, I thought we ſhould not ſo ſoone ſée you: For which let vs thanke this Lady that with you comes, ſeeing ſhe tooke ſuch care of our ſafetie, which with all our ſtates we cannot ſufficiently recompence, hauing (next vnto God) by her meanes recouered our loſt times. Therefore I thinke it reaſon (ſaid <hi>Don Bryanell</hi>) ſéeing ſhe is the inſtrumentall cauſe wee repoſeſſe them, we in her ſeruice to the death vſe them, that at leaſt thereby we may ſeeme to ſatiſfie ſome part of her many deſerts, and ſo do intreat her to commaund them as her owne. Whereunto ſhe thus anſwered. It ſufficeth me great Lords, to haue done ſome ſeruice to ſuch Princes, which doth ſurpaſſe all ſatiſfaction whatſoeuer I may of you receiue: how much the more, that will not be ſo little which you muſt vndertake, in behalfe of this diſinherited Princeſſe my Coozin, wherewith this reſteth fully recompenced, which they againe replied with great courteſie: and then <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> went to <hi>Arfileo</hi> and imbracing him ſaid.</p>
               <p>We now haue time noble Prince to know the cauſe that mooued you without my leaue to enter within this place. I am not ſo wearie of the laſt demaunde (replied hee) but that I may ſatiſfie you now in this, though your ſelfe be well, and ſéeing that the laſt aduenture coſt ſo deare, it were no reaſon to leaue you in this, vnſatiſfied.</p>
               <p>In theſe and ſuch like ſpéeches continued they till ſupper time: which come, they all did eate togither, becauſe of the wounded Princes. Héere they ſtayed fiftéene dayes, till the Princes were well able to trauaile: in which time and daye <hi>Bellona</hi> taking <hi>don Bellianis</hi> a part, ſhe ſaid vnto him walking through thoſe roomes. I doo well knowe moſt excellent Prince, and ſo iudge my ſelfe altogither vnwoorthy, and it not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarye to giue you counſaile concerning your moſt great
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4771:33"/>
actions: Yet becauſe you are a ſtranger in an vnknowne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and in a place where euerie one would wiſh your down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall with extreameſt death, and ſo many néedſome aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I preſume to tell you, that though faithfully in heart and with good reaſon you obſerue, and vnfainedly keepe the lawe and religion of your profeſſion, yet muſt you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it, and by no meanes manifeſt it, for if in the leaſt reſpect you doo, it may coſt you your deareſt life. And moreouer, after that by the vertue of your inuincible arme you haue ſafely eſtabliſhed the Princeſſe <hi>Aurora</hi> in her v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped royaltyes, you muſt procure and endeuour to arriue at the Soldane of <hi>Babilons</hi> Court, where you muſt ſuſtaine your neuer fainting heart, with your accuſtomed courage: for you ſhall there ſee your ſelfe in ſo many great perils, that you ſhall a thouſand times wiſh for death, as a remedie for them. But heereof take no thought, for they are things ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſupremeſt powers, yet alwayes beare on your ſheeld the ſame deuiſe that you nowe haue, though for her ſake you ſhall be putte in great, and ſuffer many and tedious paſſions, yet ſhall you bee thereby knowne, and your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall fame blazed ouer the whole earths continent, which you ſhall ſtill weare, till I aduertiſe you to the contrarie: Wherewith ſhe ended, and the Prince thus replyed. I will not render to you ſuch thanks as this care and great courteſies deſerue, for euerie thing I poſſeſſe beeing at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, it is reaſon you guard and protect them as your owne. Herewith they returned to theyr companie, and <hi>don Brianell</hi> hauing ſéene them both together, ſaid. I would not haue you be ſo long together, neither that you ſhould learn any thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you might further excell vs in fight, which if it be ſo, it were no reaſon that I whoſe merites bee ſo inferiour to yours, ſhould learne them. You may well doo it (replied <hi>don Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis</hi>) hauing in the laſt conflict reaped the profite, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of any thing that might haue happened vnto vs. In all things you will ſeeme to yeelde vnto mee the vantage,

anſwered <hi>Don Bryanell,</hi> though there be nothing in me that may any way pleaſe you or the Prince <hi>Arfileo,</hi> ſince as you ſhewe, you would haue mée hadde that carefull feare of you, as well not knowing as knowing you, yet doo not I knowe why I ſhould feare you, beeing accompanied with the diuine beautie of this moſt fayre and excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.

               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> beeing of nature pleaſant and courteous, kept them in pleaſing chat the reſt of the time of theyr beeing there, which was ſome eight dayes: which expired, they bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to depart thence, hadde an armour preſented to each of them by <hi>Bellona,</hi> the richeſt and fayreſt that euer was ſeene. That which <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> had, was of a taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny colour, with ſuch naturall workes, imboſſed with pearles ſo bright, that they yeelded as much light as tenne burning Torches in any darke place, but cheefely the ſhéelde, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the verie ſelfe ſame image it hadde before, which was drawne with ſuch perfection and curioſitie of arte, that if they had euer ſéene the ſubſtance, they woulde haue iudged it the counterfeit or portrature of <hi>Florisbella,</hi> the Soldane of <hi>Babilons</hi> Daughter: which although the Princeſſe <hi>Aurora</hi> knewe, yet ſayde nothing, imagining the wiſe woman had not without ſpeciall cauſe ſet it there. About it was written the aforeſaide <hi>Motto,</hi> ſo perfectly made with great Orient pearle, that it forced admiration in each beholder. Hee had alſo a ſcabbard giuen him for his ſword, made of maſſie gold, with letters drawne thereon, declaring the manner of the winning thereof. <hi>Arfileos</hi> were like them hee hadde in the caue, and <hi>Don Brianels</hi> were of diuers colours, whoſe workmanſhip was woorth a great treaſurie. Did not I ſay I ſhould in all things haue the aduantage, that for a white armor of no value, which I did weare in the battell, haue giuen mee
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:4771:34"/>
now ſo rich and faire? It is not giuen you as a gift for your olde ſaide <hi>Arfileo</hi>) but that you ſhould pay for them.

Striue not about ſo ſmall matter (ſaide <hi>Don Bellianis</hi>) for I will pay for all, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing greateſt cauſe for it. Then ſtraight were they with them armed: and taking leaue of the ſage Matrone, ſhe ſayd. You will by the way néed Pages to attend on you, therefore will I giue you thrée of mine, and ſo preſented them thrée dwarffes, ſo little that they greatly delighted to ſée their ſmalneſſe, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> whoſe ſhortneſſe reached not to the others middle, though they were wonderfull lowe. Where inhabite, and are ingendred ſuch gentle people as theſe? ſayd <hi>Don Brianell,</hi> I ſhould long remaine among them, if I ſhould ſtay there, to be accounted nothing as euerie one of them is elſe where. You ſhall not bée accounted nothing (ſaide <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> dwarffe called <hi>Ordino</hi>) for they would al ſo perſecute you that ſéeing your bigneſſe to theirs, they would (wanting ground) tread on you in ſteade of it.

But all that is left, is yours (ſaid the Princeſſe) therefore feare not. If it bée ſo (replied he) I haue no leſſe right to that which you carrie: therefore were it not amiſſe you giue it mee.

And thus went he ſtraight to the Princes while they gazed on him) going like a valorous and well diſpoſed Knight. The Duke no leſſe wondering to ſée their gallant demeanour, and riches of armour, ſpecially <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> whoſe ſight ſurprized him with ſudden admiration: and béeing nigh them, he kindly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted them (being of nature milde, gentle, and affable, for which he had obtained the name of courteous) and thus ſaid. I am ſo aſtoniſhed (braue and valiant knights) in ſéeing the braue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of your perſons, and ſtrange maner of trauelling, that I haue receiued ſuch content, as the like I ſhall neuer obtaine, chiefly at this time, beeing ſubiect to a grieuous melancholie gréefe. And becauſe I ſuppoſe ye are going to the triumph at <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> I intreate you to employ me in this iourney, for that you ſéeme ſtraungers of ſome remote Countrey. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the valour of our owne perſons may merite farre greater ſeruice, yet I pray you denie me not this requeſt: for I hope herein to diminiſh part of my boyſterous and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſorrowe, with your gentle conuerſation. The Princes intreating one another to anſwer, <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. The offers (moſt noble Duke) which by your liberall bountie we receiue, are ſo great, (as wee beeing no other then errant knights) can no way deſerue. And though wee had not

determined to bee at thoſe triumphes: yet to accompliſh your requeſt willingly doe condiſcend thereto, yeelding the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compteleſſe thankes of duetifull ſeruitors at your commaund. For which the Duke very ioyfully intertained the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with the Ladies in his owne company, and ſo made to <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing by the way of pleaſant matters, till they came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a myle of the Cittie, harde by a great riuer, ouer which they muſt of neceſſitie paſſe by a bridge that there was. Which the Duke ſeeing, ſaid: Confounded in our owne diſcourſes (Sirs knights) wee haue loſt our way. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> ſeing the Cittie, and not knowing to what ende the Duke ſpake it, replyed. If that bee the cittie, I thinke this is the right way. Tis, anſwered the Duke. But we may not paſſe this bridge, for it will bée mightily defended. Who bée they, (demanded hee) that will defend it againſt ſuch Knightes as bee with vs? They that doe it, will defend it againſt the whole worlde (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Duke) For in this kingdome are fower Knightes, the valianteſt that on the earth doe breath, all brothers. Which in one battell that the <hi>Souldan</hi> had againſt the <hi>Souldan</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> performed in it ſuch haughtie deedes, that by their pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per valour, the victorie was obtained, which got them ſuch honour, that till this day, they are reputed the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt knights that may be found. Wheruppon the <hi>Sophy,</hi> to honour them, bad them demand what they would, and hée would graunt it. (They anſwered) they would haue nothing but this Caſtle &amp; the Bridge, that no Knights might go that way, vnleſſe hée ſhould leaue his armour and horſe, or ouercomming them all in fight, paſſe by. The <hi>Sophy</hi> granted it, with a great liuing be ſides to mantaine their ſtates. So they béeing come to this bridge, haue brought with them two mightie and ſtrong Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, whoſe fierceneſſe no hundreth Knights dare abide in combate together. And haue aboue thrée yeares defended this paſſage, and not any knight hithertoo hath vanquiſhed them. For though they bee ſtrong and valiant, yet in their combate doe not procéede like good knights; For if it happeneth that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4771:37"/>
knight vnhorſeth any of them, hee muſt Jouſt with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, till hee ouerthrowe them all: but if hee bee by any blowe himſelfe ouerturned, he ſtraight looſeth his armes. Or if hee ſhould vnhorſe them all, hee muſt after combate with all ſix together, beeing the vnreaſonableſt thing that euer was heard of. And this is the cauſe why this bridge and way is no more vſed, by reaſon of the miſhappes that there befalls to wandring knights: and therefore is called the <hi>Vnhappie bridge.</hi> The Princes greatly wondred at this aduenture, yet hauing greate deſire to prooue it (<hi>don Bellianis</hi> thus ſaid.) Truely, moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Lord, wee neuer heard of the like aduenture: but if ſo it pleaſe you, we will trye the fauours of blinde Fortune ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. So will it bee rather iudged madneſſe, then valour (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the Duke.) For it lyeth not within the compaſſe of one mans ſtrength, to vanquiſh them: For the leaſt of them is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to withſtand the famous Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that is the knight moſt feared in theſe partes: whoſe ſole name makes the <hi>Souldan</hi> himſelfe tremble when hee heares it: and alſo dares oppoſe, and confronte the ſtrength of our Prince, that is no leſſe famouſed then hee. Wherefore if you thinke good, let vs leaue this way: for I perceiue ſome of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe ſée it will bee a perpetuall blotte to our names (replyed <hi>Don Bellianis</hi>) if through feare wee ſhould not aduenture our perſons héerein. Therefore commaunde them to ſtay: for I will not hence leauing this vnattempted. While they were thus talking, they ſaw on the other ſide of the bridge, a greate number of Knights &amp; Ladies, cloathed in triumphant robes, that were comming thither to ſporte themſelues.

               <p>At which time the knights hauing turned their horſes, ranne one againſt the other, and met ſo furiouſly, that the Launces flewe in peeces, &amp; the knight of the bridge went to the ground, ſorely bruzed, &amp; <hi>Don Brianell</hi> ſo much bowed with his horſe, that hee had almoſt done the like, but ſeeing what companye beheld him, raiſed himſelfe with great courage, conſidering, it was the firſt thing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princeſſe had commanded him.

I neuer thought there could bée better knights then thoſe of the bridge, but now I ſée what aduantage theſe haue ouer them. Wonder not thereat (ſaid <hi>don Gallaneo</hi>) for in the battell wée had with the Emperour, there was in his ayde one nouell knight, whom hée there knighted, that perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſuch haughtie deedes in armes, that neither <hi>Hector,</hi> nor <hi>Achilles</hi> euer did the like. For beleeue me, hée no more eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bée aſſaulted by foure, or by two Gyants, then with one knight, and with his owne handes in the battell hée ſlewe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 12.

But as for the Emperour, I haue told you what happened mée with him in the Caſtle, he béeing vnarmed: ſo that you neede not wonder what theſe doe, though any of them doe end this aduenture, which I cannot beleeue: and if they doe, I will acknowledge it the greateſt acte that euer I heard of, by reaſon their ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fighting will bée ſo vnequall. Which hauing ſaid, the eldeſt &amp; the greateſt of the brethren, came againſt <hi>Arfileo,</hi> intending to reuenge his Brothers death, whoſe incounters were ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that their launces were made in little peeces: and in ſuch ſorte met with their bodyes, that the knight of the Caſtle was ouerthrowne with a great wound on his ſide. And <hi>Arfilleos</hi>

horſe with the ſtrong ſtroke recoyled backe thrée or four paces, that at laſte vnable to ſtay him, with admirable lightneſſe hée leapt from his backe, beeing a little wounded on the breaſt. The ſeruants of the caſtle went to him, to doe as they would haue don with <hi>don Bryanell:</hi> but the firſt that arryued, for his boldnes loſt his head: For <hi>Arfileo</hi> thinking hee ſhould not bee iudged ouerthrowne, layd hand on his ſword to defend himſelfe: wherewith hee would haue made them knowe his valour, extended farther then thitherto hee had ſhowen. But the two brothers that <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> had vnhorſed, arryued with their drawne ſwords: the like did the Gyants. And on the otherſide <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> and the Duke did ſo, that in ſhort time among them all there began a terryble and fearefull bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: For all the Dukes knights would paſſe ouer the Bridge, But the <hi>Sophy,</hi> the Princeſſe <hi>Perſiana,</hi> and <hi>Don Gallaneo</hi> went and parted them, and demaunded the cauſe why they were ſo mingled togither, &amp; did not proceede with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate as they had begun: which eyther they ſhould doe, or let them paſſe? Wee are content to doe eyther (ſaid <hi>Don Bellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis:</hi>) but this knight fell not, ſeeing by anothers ſtrength hee left not the ſaddle, and therefore ought not to looſe his horſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the iouſtes bee ended. He may no more mount (ſaid they.) Who ſhall iudge it (demaunded <hi>Don Bellianis.</hi>) Wee neede no iudge (ſaid they) for it is our cuſtome: but if any muſt be, let it bee the <hi>Souldan</hi> (our Lord) heere preſent. Be it ſo, (ſaid the Duke.) Then (ſaid the <hi>Sophy</hi>) I awarde, that ſince the knight was not by another vnhorſed, hee looſe not his horſe nor armour, but that hee bee vanquiſhed, ſéeing hee forſooke his horſe: ſo that hee may iouſt no more.</p>
               <p>Great profite doe they get by this ſentence (ſayd a proude knight) that on the <hi>Souldan</hi> attended, and was a neere Alley to the Gyants that defended the Bridge.

               <p>The knight inraged with deſire to reuenge thoſe words, anſwered. Let vs ſet aſide the <hi>Souldans</hi> iudgement as a matter impertinent to vs: But if thou wilt, vppon whither of the knightes be ouercome accept this my gage, I giue it thee.</p>

You deferre it too long (ſaid the knight) and our fight will be voide if you meane to winne the bridge by ſtrength: for theſe knights earneſtly deſire your armour, beeing ſo rich.

The Prince ſtrucke in ſuch manner, that piercing his ſhielde and armour, mightily wounded him on the breaſt: and both méeting with their horſes, the Gyant meaſured his length on the earth, and the Prince horſe ſet both knees on the ground, wherewith hee reſted ſo amazed, that hee had not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to ſpurre him.

Sir knight, why you ſhould kneele to any, deſeruing for your valour and incomparable bountie the ſame dutie of euery one. But for one onely thing muſt I needs now intreate you, which I am ſure you will not denie mee, iudging your courteſie no leſſe then your haughtie courage, of which all ſuch knights as you ſhould as much priſe themſelues, as of their proper valor, which thing before I expreſſe it, I will thereto binde you by your promiſe.

Hereupon the Duke, <hi>Don Gallaneo,</hi> and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Perſiana,</hi> after their gréetings, came thither to knowe the conference betwéene him and the knight: ſo did the Princeſſe <hi>Aurora</hi> and the reſt of her companie, who were entertained with ſuch courteſie, as if they were knowne to be the greateſt péeres of the world.

how well <hi>don Bellianis</hi> had anſwered: which done, they all highly commended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their braue diſpoſition.

The ſight of this his rare fauor, with his haughtie exployts in armes, made them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazedly think him the ofſpring of the mighty god of war, iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible that any mortall creature ſhould poſſeſſe two ſuch extreams, wherin he ſurpaſſed al within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> compaſſe of the earth.

He had moreouer a certaine maner of milde grauitie, that with it he drew vnto him the loue of the admirers: for it being with anger moued, there could be no countenance more ſterne then his, yet he ſo refrained himſelf by forcing it from him, that ſtraight he would expell it. He was a great maintainer and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of iuſtice, that if any did committe a fault or erred, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would ſée him puniſhed.

De not thinke your matter ſo happeleſſe, but imagine you may by ſome meanes attaine the Princeſſe <hi>Perſiana</hi> to your wife. I cannot perſwade my ſelfe (replied the Duke) there may bée any remedie for my gréefe.

Do not ſo afflict your ſoule (ſayd <hi>Don Bellianis</hi>) for I haue thought vpon a meane, which if you agrée thereto, is, that to morrow we all méet at the Tourney, where, if <hi>Don Gallaneo,</hi> thinking himſelfe the beſt Knight within this Court) doth enter, there alſo I meane to bee in an vnknowne armour, and méeting with him will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint him of his new betrothed loue. For I haue no leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire then you, to ſende him out of the world. And to the end with more ſecrecie wee may do it, you ſhall giue out, I am ſo ſore wounded, that I reſt vnable to riſe, and ſo <hi>Don Gallaneo</hi> ſhall not ſcape my handes, and your intent ſhalbe at full accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. If this faile, you haue ſuch knights, that with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maugre all the court, I will conduct her where you will. The duke hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, knew not where he was, with ioy, &amp; imbraſing him ſaid. Not without great cauſe (renowmed knight of the golden image) did I from the firſt houre I ſaw you, comprize ſuch loue of you, &amp; was ſo ſuddenly affected, as the man in whom might

Thinke not ſo much on the end (replied <hi>Don Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianis</hi>) if you ſée the matter happily begunne: for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo ſurely grounded, but the beginning will require great labour, eſpecially ſuch enterpriſes as theſe. Wherefore my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, ſeeing our time is ſo ſhort, that you ſend halfe of your men to attend our comming in the way we muſt take, ſome ten miles hence, taking with them double horſing, that when we arriue with ours tired, &amp; being ther forced to fight, we may find freſh horſes. And this done, 1000. choſen men wil ſerue to fetch her hence, ſo that they perfectly kaow the way. The duke liked well of this counſel: where they broke of, being aduertiſed how the Soldan, &amp; the princeſſe <hi>Perſiana,</hi> with all the chief no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie (except <hi>don Gallaneo,</hi> that remained about another mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſtraight ſhalbe declared) came to viſit him: wherfore the duke hearing it, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to méet him, yet for al his haſt he found him comming vp the ſtaires talking with the princes <hi>Arfileo, don Brianell,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aurora,</hi> that went forth to receiue them: who when they ſaw the duke go towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) the princeſſe <hi>Perſiana</hi> ſaid.

The duke knéeling before her, demanded her beautious hands to kiſſe them, for that fauor ſhe did him by her good counſel, &amp; that none might heare replied if your diuine fauor, moſt excellent Lady, doth not forſake me, I may ſecurely reſt fearleſſe of all dangers: but I doubt I ſhall with your abſence remaine altogither vnable thereto, hauing loſt the fruition of your diuine fauor, poſſeſſed by a ſtranger in my ſight.

Séeing you haue thus long bin idle I meane now to taſk you for your labor: for you ſhalbe this day my gardian, for that the aduenturous knight may not be both the princeſſes and mine, &amp; therfore wil I renounce him, hauing ſo ſoone forgotten me. Then belike my ſelfe being deſirous (ſaid <hi>don Brianell</hi>) to obtaine both your fauors, muſt now feare to looſe all: yet am I content, that my Lord the duke may haue the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of my place.

And going to his beds ſide, demaunded how he felt himſelfe: wherunto he replied.

Think not much of that I do, for my father doth force it, &amp; I would put my ſelf in danger to auoid it: and I haue greatly reioiced that you haue brought with you ſuch valiant warriers, as at the vnhappie bridge I ſaw. For if the knight of the golden image were not as he is, I would haue intreated him to procure to diſſolue this match, done contrarie to my hearts intent. He and I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4771:48"/>
whereupon ſhe then went to his beds ſide, while the Souldane talked apart with <hi>Arfileo,</hi> whom he highly eſtéemed, knowing him to be ſo great a Prince as <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> had ſayde. The princeſſe <hi>Perſiana</hi> ſéeing ſo good occaſion, demaunding how he felt himſelf with his great wounds, as much gréeuing for them, as though he were the Prince her brother, and the more, being in time wherein ſhe ſo much néeded the helpe of his vnconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſtrength, to the ſubuerting of her enemies: whereto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: I do féele my ſelfe (moſt excellent Princeſſe) verie wel, eſpecially to accompliſh any thing appertaining to your high ſeruice, wherefore aſſuredly commaund and imploy mee anie way wherein my worthineſſe may preuaile for your behoofe. It is no ſmall promiſe (replied ſhe) you offer me, for as I do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neede it, ſo ſhall I haue cauſe to employ the greateſt part of your valour. And therfore (moſt glorious knight) know, as you alreadie haue vnderſtood of the Duke, that the Soldane my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath determined to marrie me to the Prince <hi>Don Galla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo:</hi> which doth ſo torment my paſſion-broken heart, that I here vow, if al other meanes of my deſired remedie do faile me, my proper hand ſhall finiſh the tragicke ſcene of my afflicted life, ere I will conſent to this vnfortunate wedding: &amp; though many nobles haue ſolicited my father to the contrarie, yet will he not be ſatiſfied, anſwering them woordes vnbeſéeming both his maieſtie and their eſtates. Wherefore if I haue cauſe ſo to complaine of my ſoule-conſuming greefes (if euer you felt the like) you may eaſily iudge. And to conclude, I haue determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to marrie none but the Duke <hi>Alfyron</hi> the Courteous. For when I ſawe your high admired déedes in the battell, I then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured my ſelf of help. But now through your gréeuous wounds it hath ſince ſo increaſed, that had I not diſcouered my diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vnto you, I had to morrow wedded me to death, rather then to him I ſo abhorre. Therefore this onely I intreate you, that commiſerating the ſtate of me the moſt vnhappieſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe liuing, you would procure ſome redreſſe to terminate my woes, that I may not fall in his hands whom mortally I hate:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4771:48"/>
I meane <hi>Don Gallaneo,</hi> wherein you ſhall commit no error againſt my father, whoſe decaying honour with his life, will be augmented by his death. For <hi>Don Gallaneo</hi> is not the man that merits his Daughter, being a knight of the leaſt faith at this time liuing. And I cannot be perſwaded, that ſo famous and glorious a Prince as the Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi> could by him be aſſaulted, vnleſſe it were with treaſon and ſuch like. And the greateſt coraſiue to my hart is, I cannot in ſome night ſteal out of the Pallace, and ſo depart with the Duke, whereſoeuer he would conuey me: which my father ſuſpecting, kéepeth mee with a great gard. Thus haue I (ſir knight) diſcloſed the tenor of my gréefes, beſéeching you that if any hope of remedie hang in the angry ſkies for my releaſe, you would let me know it, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring your ſelfe, I will refuſe no daunger, and will vndergo al perils, accounting them as greateſt pleaſures, ſo therby I may fruſtrate this deteſted match. <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> all this while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted much amazed, to ſée how paſſionately the Princeſſe gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and with what confidence ſhe had manifeſted vnto him her minde: and without longer deliberating on the matter, as if he had reſolued thereon with conſent of his Companion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Great is the pleaſure I haue receyued (moſt excellent Princeſſe) with the knowledge of this your reſolue, hauing thereon ere this conferred with the Duke, and ſo I only expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this your high commaund, and alſo hoping you would bind me to your perpetuall obſeruation, by your viſitation I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thus in bed, by which occaſion I more conueniently might know the reſolution of your minde, which now being aſſured of you, ſhall néed no more, then commit the execution of all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my charge, your ſelfe ſéeming to know nothing: for I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and promiſe you neuer more after to put on armour, if this marriage be effected with <hi>Don Gallaneo,</hi> And doubt not but with the helpe of the immortall Gods, it ſhall be as I ſay: But leaſt we ſhould force ſuſpition by our long diſcourſe, I will not any longer ſtay you.

But <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> ſéeing his enemies to double his men in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, thruſt himſelfe within the moſt furie of the battell, where hard by the Soldanes theater, méeting with a knight of ſtature like a giant called <hi>Fydaſto</hi> the cruell, raiſed both their ſwords, and together at one time diſcharged on each other ſuch blowes,

that <hi>Fydaſto</hi> was ouerthrowne and wounded on the head, and <hi>don Bryanell</hi> bowed to the pummel of his ſaddle, with greate courage ſtaying himſelf. This was one of the knights that <hi>don Gallaneo</hi> had charged to kill <hi>don Bryanell</hi> and <hi>Arfileo:</hi> who ſéeing himſelf downe, with a diueliſh rage roſe, &amp; with a hoarſe voyce cried, Downe with the knight, that againſt the order and law of tourney, beareth an edged ſword: whereof he had no cauſe to complaine, for hee and the other two knights that had the like charge, did weare the like. Straight was the venturous knight incompaſſed with aboue 1000. Knights, that leauing their tilt, onely procured his death. But he ſo demeaned himſelf among them, that in a triſe he beate to the ground aboue twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſore wounded: and yet his men could not come to help him, by reaſon of the multitude that had incloſed him. Then <hi>Arfileo</hi> ſéeing this, moſt valiantly prickt foorth with his troupe, and <hi>don Gallaneo,</hi> that nought imagined but their deaths, brande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing his trunchion, made againſt him with all his battell, that <hi>don Bryanell</hi> might not bee ſuccoured: the like did the Duke <hi>Alfyron</hi> with the remnant of his men, and in the midſt of the field they met with ſuch force, that moſt of them wiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues farre thence at that time. The Duke &amp; the two knights ſtraight entered among their aduerſaries, performing it verie brauely. But <hi>Arfileo</hi> that had no other intent then to helpe <hi>don Bryanell,</hi> paſſed through the thickeſt of the ſquadron, that none durſt withſtand him, and entred within their ring, where they ſlew their horſes, procuring the like by them. But they beganne to make ſuch deſtruction of them, that they had laid at their féete aboue a humdred knights, ſome ſlaine outright, and ſome gréeuouſly wounded: and al that beheld the fight, thought it ill done that ſo many knights ſhould onely ſet vpon two, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Soldane was about to deſcend and part them.

They with great willingnes promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do the vttermoſt of their poſſibilitie: and ſéeing the matter ſuffered no delay, and that they like wiſe ventured ſome part of their owne, in that they were the dukes neare allies, did then take leaue of the princeſſe, and departed towards the Soldan, whom they found with all his men readie to march. So appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to him, he greatly reioyced with their preſence, thereby thinking they wold ioine with him, ſuppoſing at firſt they were gone to the duke. Whereupon he courteouſly made out to méet them: who (their cuſtomed honor performed) humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to kiſſe his hands: but he would not by any means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereto: whereat they thus began.

For in readineſſe &amp; willingneſſe of mind, they wanted nought but the beginning of the conflict. The two kings not a litle maruailed at the Soldans diſcourſe. Whereupon the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> tooke occaſion to ſpeake as followeth. The knight of the golden Image, is not in that greatneſſe of fault as you iudge him in (moſt mighty Lord:) for if you would but in the equall ballance of right reaſon, weigh the cauſe you may plainly ſée how greatly <hi>Don Gallaneo</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to kill the aduenterous knight, and the Prince <hi>Arfileo,</hi> againſt all the lawes and rights of Turney, nought regarding your awfull clamours to the contrarie: but then more procured their deaths: whereat no maruell if the Knight of the golden Image, and the Duke, in thir owne defence did ſlay him. And we know, that the knight in the gréene armour was he of the golden Image, for we learned it of ſome of them that fled when <hi>don Galfeo</hi> died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he which ſlue him, and vanquiſhed them, was the ſame that returned victor of the Turney, So that you may well thinke he determined to do by them, what they did to him, and his.

But if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, you will perſeuer in theſe rigorous determinations, conſider the many thouſand deaths thereby like to enſue: for the Duke will indure no wrong. Remember alſo (great Lord) the knight of the golden Image is he (though the chiefeſt cauſe of <hi>Don Gallaneos</hi> death) that fréed you from two great, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, one from the aduenture of the vnhappie Bridge, the other by the death of the <hi>Rypliean</hi> dragon, and that hereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth your owne honour in your daughters innocencie, and that the Duke may plead his cauſe, and we our ſelues will go

If you cauſe the duke (replied the Sophy) to come and ſubmit himſelfe, I promiſe you there ſhall be no wrong proffered him, nor any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the right of law &amp; iuſtice, which I onely do, that if any of <hi>Don Gallaneos</hi> kindred ſhould expect any reuenge at my hands for his death, they may know what I haue done herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And hereupon I pawne my kingly faith, and royall word vnto you.

Whereupon the Soldane commanded euerie man to retyre to his quarter, he himſelfe going to his Court, to expect the kings returne, who ſtraight repayred to the Dukes Pallace, where they greatly reioyced to ſee the good order, and care by them kept: inſomuch that the Soldan was not there able to enter by force of armes, though he brought all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces redoubled.

               <p>SO ſoone as the duke was arriued at the Soldanes pallace, with the companie mentioned in the precedent Chapter,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4771:63"/>
and thinking it vnméet to aduertiſe him therof, they al diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and on foot entred the great hall where the Sophy ſat: who, when he ſaw him come with his blood changed in his face, as being the man that mortally hated the duke, which now being nigh him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> humbled himſelf on his knées, requeſting the kiſſing of his royall hands. You néed them not Duke (ſaid the Sophy) ſince you account your deſerts ſo meritorious, and of your ſelf ſo highly, that I ſending for you to appeare before me, vtterly denied it, and with all your power reſiſted my commandes. The Gods forbid I ſhould haue committed any ſuch offence (replied the Duke.) And well do you know (dread ſoueraigue) that I neuer eſtéemed in any your affaires, to hazard both life, and my whole eſtate in your ſeruice. But doubting (your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being full of ire) wold not hear me, according to the iuſtice of my cauſe, I rather choſe to withdraw my ſelfe vnto my lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, where to this inſtant I remained: from whence I was now called bytheſe noble knights, to appeare before your migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe. So being in this conference, there entred the hall thrée giants, the greateſt, vglieſt &amp; fierceſt that any humane nature could produce: they were al armed ſauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heads, whoſe helms and ſhéelds were borne by their ſquires: on them attended 30. knights, not much inferior to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in bigneſſe: all their outward garments were of mourning cloth, who went directly to the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, that throughly viewing them, greatly wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred at their mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous fierceneſſe. Loe one that was moſt deformed, and ſéemed to command the reſt, without dutie to the Soldan, began thus with a voice, whoſe hollow roring made all the hall reſounde. High &amp; mightie lord we beléeue that ſmall is the notice come to your eares of vs, hauing but little traced thy dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, althogh we haue endeuored with all our power, &amp; the vtmoſt of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing of your houſe by our ſeruice, wherof your ſon the prince <hi>Perianeo</hi> is a ſufficient witneſſe, as the man in the wars of <hi>Antioch</hi> being tearmed the knight of the Image, we ayded, of him may you know I am king of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Felleſtone</hi> the fierce, brother to theſe knigts here preſent
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4771:63"/>
that knowing you married the Princeſſe <hi>Perſiana</hi> to our coſin <hi>don Gallaneo</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> we came to honor his nuptials: and arriuing néere this citie, two of my knights who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſent to ſeeke two damzels of my companie, were ſlaine, by one which I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood is called the knight of the golden Image, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there are alſo many tales bruted of their valour. Moreouer we were certified, that he and the duke <hi>Alfiron,</hi> ſlue in the turney moſt trecherouſly, the prince <hi>don Gallaneo,</hi> and his coſin <hi>don Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feo.</hi> And thogh we are aſſured you wil execute on them the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that ſo vile treaſon requires (for wee haue vnderſtood the impriſonment of your daughter the princeſſe <hi>Perſiana,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter to their deaths.) Notwithſtanding, we being perſons to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this aforeſaid matter concernes, do accuſe as wel the duke as the knight of the golden Image, with the princeſſe <hi>Perſiana</hi> your daughter, as authors, &amp; actors of their deaths, and therfore traitors and malefactors. And I vow to approue it againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both togither, or with what knight ſoeuer the princeſſe ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point in her defence: for I will not be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted a giant nor king of the land where any of vs is knowne, if I make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe this their treaſon, that you may chaſtiſe it as you ſhall better iudge: and herewith ended his ſpéech. The great rage conceiued by the knights, hearing themſelues called traitors, cannot be ſufficiently expreſt. The Soldan vnderſtanding of the Giant what he was, roſe from his ſeate to intertain him, as his ſtate required, intreating him to ſit downe. It bootes not (ſaid he) but only that ye ſend for theſe traitors, to anſwere my obiections: for I haue ſworne not to put off my armor, till I be ſatiſfied with my reuenge. The Duke ſtepping euen where the Giant was talking who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he better ſaw his deformitie and bigneſſe (for though himſelfe were of a good ſtature, yet rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched not to his middle) ſomewhat feared him: but remembring by what valiant knights he was backt, reſolutely made this anſwer to the giants former ſpéeches. If we had not heretofore heard, &amp; now by experience ſeen thy great pride (king of <hi>Ciprus</hi>) we had reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to think no humane creature could haue procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

And if in caſe thou bee ſuch a one, as thy ſpéech declares, thou more obſcureſt with thy euill deedes his his royall progenie, then euer with wordes thou mayeſt amplifie it. Moreouer, know I am the Duke <hi>Alfyron,</hi> whom thou commeſt to accuſe: and whereas thou ſayeſt, I and the Knight of the golden Image haue trecherouſlie ſlaine <hi>Don Gallaneo,</hi> I replie, thou moſt falſely lyeſt, which my ſelfe am readie to approue in battell, or preſent my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for the ſame. The Prince <hi>Arfileo</hi> all this while rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to choake with extreame rage, yet moderately ſayde thus. Since thou art altogether ouerwhelmed in the treaſons thou ſpeakeſt off (<hi>Cyprus</hi> King) know that touching the knight of the golden Image, thou haſt moſt falſely lied in thy throate, and therefore bring with thée in field one of thy brothers, or whom elſe thou wilt. For if thou wilt not ſtay vntill his wounds bée whole, my ſelfe in his place will approoue the vtmoſt of thy ſpéeches, to be méerelie falſe: for he is not a Prince nor knight that would haue procured <hi>Don Gallaneos</hi> death, except for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereunto, through his great treaſons and demerits, yet his Cooſen, like a vilde traitour died treacherouſly, going to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him in his bed. <hi>Don Brianell</hi> diſſembling his anger, with a ſcoffing laughter, not ſuffring the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> to roplie, ſaid to him. I thinke, King, Knight, or Giant, or what thou wilt, thou thoughteſt thy challenge would returne vnaccepted, becauſe no knight might be here able in bigneſſe and deforme, to anſwere thée. And yet in my opinion, thy pride is farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then thy bodie. But paſſing this, knowe, that in the Princeſſe <hi>Perſianaes</hi> name, I will make the thirde in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batte agaynſt thy brothers or thy ſelfe, to prooue (with the helpe of the immortall Gods) that in the great vntroth brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed forth by thée, thou moſt treacherouſly lieſt.</p>

               <p>By the high powers of the Gods (dread Lord) if theſe ſillye mad-men were not before thy ſacred preſence, I would haue inflicted ſuch heauie puniſhment on them, that they ſhould bee examples to all others as ſhould preſume to ſpeake in ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to any of my degree.

               <p>Therefore it behooues you (Duke) to finde a Champion to vndertake this battell for you, ſéeing the Prince <hi>Arfileo</hi> doth it for the knight of the golden Image, and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for my daughter, and it muſt bee foorthwith.</p>
               <p>Now though the Duke ſéemed outwardly diſpleaſed, being forbidden the combatte in perſon, yet was it not ſo, for hee greatly feared the Gyants forces: Neuertheleſſe, he anſwered the Soldan in this manner.

But drawing ſtrength from his neuer fainting courage (ſéeing Filiſtone that fierce gazed on him, reſting aſtoniſhed at his great monſtruoſitie) turned to the Souldane with theſe words. If according to the iuſtice of my cauſe (moſt mightie lord) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the adminiſtration of thoſe men to that ende, placed by the immortall gods, on this terreſtriall ball, promiſing ſuch large guerdons, in their future life of euerlaſting happineſſe, if with equitie and right, they execute the function of ſo high commanding powers: whereunto the ſpacious territories of your vaſte Empery bindes you, you looke into this whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſearching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true ground therof, not ſuffering the vnbridled paſſion, of baſe parcialitie, to blinde the eyes of your admiring iudgement, which moſt often is woont to obſcure, and vtterly with ignominy, beſmeares the magnanimitie of the Nobleſt mindes.</p>

Hee ſéeing himſelfe in ſuch perill, letting fall his axe, would haue drawne his dagger, which at his backe he had, but his arme was held ſo faſte, that hee could not ſturre it, and turning to ſée what did it, ſaw it was a moſt beauteous Lady: whereupon the Lyons and knightes vanſhed.

Hath there béene no newes of him ſince his departing, or did he ſo ſoone forget the Princeſſe? No (ſaid they) for it was ſaid, he euerie day came into the court with ſeuerall horſe and armour, and then writ diuerſe letters to her, beſeeching her to receiue him as her knight, letting her knowe he was Prince of this land. The letter was deliuered to vs, and we fearing ſome euill to inſue thereby, durſt not giue it her. But what anſwer made you (ſaid <hi>Don Bellianis</hi>) to him that gaue you the letter: None other (anſwered the Damzell) ſaue that the Princeſſe would not anſwere it. Yet might you haue giuen her it. There is none for their liues that durſt haue done ſo: for beſides that, ſhe doth iniurie herſelfe, being but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſéene, and abhorring ſuch matters extreamly, ſhee hateth this Prince greatly, becauſe he was the cauſe that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Aurora</hi> loſt her kingdome, with her fathers life, which was Uncle to our Ladie Princeſſe, and brother to her mother. With that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> reſted ſomewhat comforted, and to giue place to his thoughts, praied the Damzels to go to bed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would ſléepe: which they did: and being withdrawne, they reaſoned, that the knight of the golden Image ſhould bée in loue with their Ladie. Beléeue not (ſaid <hi>Beriana</hi>) if ſince you named the Princeſſe <hi>Florisbella,</hi> he hath not béene captiuated with her prayſes, elſe why ſhould hee ſo particularly inquire for her. Will you know it certainly (ſaid <hi>Floriana?</hi>) Let vs riſe ſoftly and hearken what he ſayes, for it is not poſſible but hée ſhoulde vtter the aboundance of his heart, and ſo roſe in their ſmocks to heare him, who to himſelf complained, and now and then groned, and ſighed ſo bitterly, as if his heart would break.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4771:86"/>
But at laſt with a ſoft voyce he burſt into theſe paſſions. Ay mée vnfortunate Knight of the golden Image, and moſte vnhappie Prince, what accurſed Starres, voyde of all pitie, haue conducted thée to <hi>Perſepolis,</hi> to receiue ſo diſtaſtrous a death? Ah, wretch that I am, whome the power of hearts-penetrating loue, contenteth not with ſuch crueltie to torment thée, but telleth thée thou art not woorthie to ſerue whome thou deſyreſt. But thriſe happie art thou Knight of the Images: for if thou dooſt ſuffer anie paſſions, and heartes languiſhment for the diuined beautie of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt Princeſſe that euer was borne: yet are thy thoughts made knowne to her, where thou mayeſt immortallize thy ſelfe, and call thée the onelie bleſſed of all mortall men. But aye me, more vnhappie farre, then thou art happie, that muſte heare the intollerable burthen of my greeuaunces, without comforte, without helpe, and without hope. For though my ſoules true paine were knowne, where are the merittes to reape the benefite of ſo large a guerdon? But let Fortune doo her woorſt, yet will not I leaue, till I ſee howe long my deſpiſed life will labour in the Laborinth of miſfortune. And if I do méete with the Knight of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, I doo proteſt by the ſacred order I haue receiued, to make it knowen vppon his ſtéeled Burgonet, that none but I deſerue the fruition of ſuch thoughtes, though hee more largely do poſſeſſe the fauour of time, ſmiling chance, which I will obtaine, vnleſſe my tributarie death denie me paſſage to effect my will, that hardly will bee maintained with theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing tormentors, where with manie grones and ſighes, drowned in a flood of teares, wetted all his bed.</p>
               <p>Oh God (ſayde <hi>Floriana</hi>) did you euer heare ſuch a complaint of a Knight in ſo ſhort a time, not hauiug ſéene her whome hée loues? And I beleeue, (vnleſſe hee bee reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died) hée will hardly ſcape with his life, béeing thus déepelie wounded.</p>
               <p>I knowe not what to ſay, (replied her fellow Periana) for
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4771:87"/>
it is the ſtraungeſt thing I haue ſéene, that the loue of a Ladie ſhould ſo wound the heart of a Knight, agaynſt whome nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the furie of hell-bred beaſts, nor the ſtrength of migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Giants can preuaile, and whome wee haue ſéene do ſuch déedes, that ſcarce our ſelues can beléeue: and this is the greateſt of all, that ſo ſtrong a Competitor in Loue, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at this preſent to the <hi>Perſian</hi> Prince. The Knight of the golden Image is not ſo great as you eſtéeme him (ſayde <hi>Floriana</hi>) for I well knowe the high déedes and great ſtate of the other, and though he be nowe diſgraced by the Soldan, he may be reconciled.</p>
               <p>All this knowe I (ſayde the other) yet is not hée like to this, if hée ſhould bée compared. And this Knight may bee ſome great Prince, ſince (knowing the other ſueth for her) hee determineth the like. And as for his beautie, you ſée the worlde cannot equall it: and alſo for his valour, we our ſelues are good witneſſes. And for my part, though I were ſure to die, I woulde procure all meanes to effect his deſire, ſeeing the daunger hée freed vs from, and the loue wée bare him, and hee vs, deſerueth all our endeuour in this caſe. In this they continued while they fell a ſléepe, till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that they againe dreſſed him. And trulie the great deſire he had to ſee himſelfe out of that Cittie, greatly helped his woundes, that the Damzels ſayde he would bee well within ten dayes, and able to trauell, which greatly ioyed him, hoping to be quickly in the great Citie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> there to poſſeſſe the ſight of his heauenly Princeſſe.</p>

Whereunto they yéelded, making account, that as in that hurley-burley they ſhould ſacke the Soldans Pallace, ſo they might alſo vtterly ſubuert the Cittie, putting it to ſpoyle and pillage.</p>
               <p>Which made them thinke euery houre, a moneth, till they met with the Soldans power, to bee reuenged on him for all his iniueies done them, and for the breach of his word. Many in meane time ſolicited the Soldan to quietneſſe, but nothing would preuaile with him, determining to put the Duke to death, which if hee did not, was, for that hee expected the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comming of the Prince <hi>Perianeo</hi> his ſonne, with whoſe preſence, he feared not the whole power of the whole vnyted power vniuerſe, thinking then more ſafely to effect his will. Thus were fiue of the ſixe dayes paſte, that <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> had appointed, wherein hee was vppe, and walked about, and in a manner well, and able to beare armour, who ſéeing the determinate time approached, ſent the Damzels to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Princeſſe <hi>Aurora,</hi> who ſéeing it to bee requiſit, did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: telling the Sophy, that the knight of the golden I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage was wel, and not néeded more their helpe.

They thanked him: for that courteſie, anſwering they would go at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the pleaſure of the Princeſſe <hi>Aurora,</hi> whom they found with all her Ladies, in readineſſe to depart, and was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to take her leaue of the Soldan, but ere they went, the Ladies were furniſhed with good palfrayes, who returned to the Soldan with the Princeſſe, that beeing before him, thus began. Great is the wrong (moſt mightie Lord) which in thy Land thou haſte offered mee, giuing me cauſe to complaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade of thy diſcourteous entertainment, hauing againſt all right and kingly iuſtice, impriſoned the knight of the golden I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,

that accompanied mee, and to banniſh from thy terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, ſo braue a man as the aduenturous knight, with what elſe thou knoweſt. Wherfore ſéeing within thy houſe, court, and Pallace, theſe iniuries I receiued, I haue determined to returne vnto the King my Father, though gréeued to the hart, through want of the beſt company that euer Lady had And I do wiſh, that with mildeneſſe you would cutte of the dangers that heereby may inſue, that I feare my heart denyeth: which if you will not do at my intreates, euery one wil repute it to procéede of your ſupreme vertues, ſaluing thereby all thinges paſte.</p>
               <p>And remember the blood ſpilt by the Prince of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> in the battel, which (through your ingratitude) wil elſe diſparage and ſcandaliſe your royall name: beeing heeretofore reputed for ſo mighty a king, now to defame and ſtaine thy ſpotleſſe ſtate, with the name oftyrannous crueltye, and bloody barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme. And ſo ended, expecting the Soldans anſwere, who a little ſtood in ſuſpence, whether hee ſhould ſet at libertie <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> or no: but being altogether blinded with a paſſionate rage, and ſelfe-wil, reſpecting no law, made this reply.</p>
               <p>I know not (faire Princeſſe) why you ſhuld thus cholerickly argue againſt me, for the thing, that if I did not, weuld rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the honour of my vaſte Emperie, and make mee little feared of my ſubiects: ſo that were it not for this, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly giue you the knight of the golden Image.

               <p>
                  <hi>Arfileo</hi> ſéeming to go with the Princeſſe, returned alſo ſo ſoone as it was night, the better to paſſe vnknowne, where he ordered what ſhould be done the euening following, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding all their men, to go to the King of <hi>Armenias</hi> Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, from whence they might the better march.

But the Soldans men beeing many more in number, brake through them, ſpoyling their order: whereat the two Ladies, the Princeſſe <hi>Perſiana</hi> and <hi>Aurora,</hi> ſeemed more dead then aliue. But at this time, from the other ſide of the valley, there appeared the number of 4000.

               <p>Thus continuing there vpon a day, taking apart the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <hi>Perſiana,</hi> told her, that he thought it not amiſſe, if ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the accompliſhing of her deſires, ſhe ſhould forthwith wed the Duke <hi>Alfiron,</hi> leſt the chaunges of Fortune might héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after diſturbe it, and that the Souldan her father would not be ſo cruell, that hearing it would not reioyce to ſée her marryed to her content. Shée that nothing elſe deſired, ſaid, ſhe would in euery thing accord to his will, derogating in no reſpect from it. Wherefore thanking her for that honour, he conferred of it with the Duke, who thereto agreed, appoynting the nuptialls to be ſolemnized tenne dayes after, which was the time they celebrated a feaſt dedicated to their <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Knights greatly reioyced at that <hi>don Bellianis</hi> had done, preparing themſelues very ſumpteouſly againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage day, ordering a moſt ſtately Tourney in honour of the nuptialls.

               <p>The knight of the Golden Image much gréeued to ſee theſe delayes, becauſe they hindred and kept him there, from proſecuting his attended iourney: diſpayring of hoped ioyes, wanting the preſence of the cauſer of his gréefe, which he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lightned, by daily conuerſing with the damſels of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, elſe otherwiſe he hardly could haue ſtaied there all that while, which he beguiled with pleaſant diſcourſes, with thoſe Princes and Ladies, and one day talking with the Princeſſe <hi>Aurora,</hi> about her affayres in <hi>Antioch,</hi> ſhe ſaid to him, it wold not bee vnneceſſarie ſhee ſhould write vnto the Gouernour of that kingdome, placed by the Prince <hi>Don Gallaneo,</hi> on whom ſhe repoſed great truſt.</p>
               <p>I thinke it not amiſſe (anſwered <hi>Don Bellianis</hi>) if you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it will not diſaduantage you. But who ſhall carrie it, when it is made?

               <p>Whereupon <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> taking pen, yncke and paper, writ the letter, and when it was done, called the Prince <hi>Don Brianell</hi> (whom as is ſaid) greatly deſired to be imploied in that Princeſſe ſeruice, ſaid to him, hee ſhould bee the bearer of that letter, being a matter to be truſted on none but he. There is no reaſon (my good Lord) ſaid the Princeſſe, that you ſhould vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſuch trouble: hauing alreadie hitherto taken ſo much for my ſake, you neede not now farther indanger your ſelf in theſe new, &amp; ſuch ſeldom ſeen toiles, hauing at my hands receiued no fauour for any.

And ſo taking his parting leaue, the inſuing morning, he went forwards on his voyage, continuing his dayly iourneyes, till hee arriued at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where there be fell him great aduentures, as ſhall be ſet downe in his due place. So leauing him, and returning to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer purpoſe, the day was at length come, wherein the royall nuptials of the Princeſſe <hi>Perſiana,</hi> with the Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> ſhould be celebrated: againſt which time, euery one prouided the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, according to their eſtate, in ſuch tumultuous times, wherein they dayly expected the arriuall of their enemies: for which cauſe, leaſt they ſhould ſuddenly be ſurpriſed, they kept in armour aboue eight thouſand men, which they had within the Cittie, beſides their campe they had without the walles, intrencht about the furtheſt place of the citie, becauſe one ſhould not trouble the other in their ſalue.

And ſo taking a ſtrong Launce from his Page, with a ſharpe and ſtrong ſteeled Pike, came out of the liſtes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a broad field thereby: the like did the knight of the Crowne. But while they were thus talking, the other knight of the Crownes, demanded of the other knights of the Eagles, if they would breake their launces with him.

The péeces of their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mounted higher then the clouds, themſelues méeting with their horſes, bodies, ſheelds, and helmes, in ſuch manner, that both horſes fell downe dead vnder them, and their maſters ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med but in little better caſe then they, in ſuch a trance they fell, that euery one iudged them dead. Ohimmortall Gods (cryed out the valiant knight of the golden Image) what terrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters were theſe? Dead without doubt are the beſt knights this day liuing, and within himſelfe greatly maruelled to ſée his ſhéeld pierced, which till then coulde neuer bee penetrated with any Iron.

               <p>THe Emperour remembring the <hi>Sages</hi> words, tooke his Launce and mounted on horſbacke, approching the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Bollera,</hi> almoſt by breake of day, which he founde begyt with ſo many multitudes, that he greatly wondred at their ſuddaine arriuall, and not knowing on which ſide the Duke laie intrenched, becauſe the Citie was round about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, he ruſhed among thoſe Tentes, as if he had bene one of the Centinels, and thus he went till he came vnto a great pauilion, which he thought to be the Generals of thoſe troopes, and looking into it, he ſawe many knights talking with another that lay in his bed, whom he iudged according to his manner and conditions, to be the Sophy, and hard by him, he ſpied ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without his helme, the Prince of <hi>Perſia,</hi> that had bene cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after by the ſame meanes that he was, their conference was, that it would be good, to giue another aſſault vnto the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for if it were but only to affright them within, it would not be amiſſe. And the Emperour being buſily harkoning to this, there came vnto him, a knight, that was Collonell of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Court of guard, and ſaide. What doo you here, you are not in your quarters? I was walking about (ſaid the Emperour) and here I ſtaied to looke vpon this Tent. And therfore ſhall you goe to priſon (replied the other) ſeeing you haue no more care. The Emperour ſaid, let vs go whither you will. Here vpon the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell turned to foure knightes, and charged them to conuay that knight to his Tent. Which they going to doo, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſorely wounded, ouerthrew them one after an other to the ground with his lance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and about to do the like by the Colonel, he thruſt himſelf among the Tents, calling out for help. But the Emperour that hereat became furious, reached his launce at the Souldan (that laie a bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with ſuch force, raiſing himſelf on
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:4771:115"/>
his ſtirrops, which if it had gone ſtraight, he had no more néede to make warre, yet it miſſed him ſo little, that the Launce paſt betwixt his arme and left ſide, and ranne through all the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nayling it aboue a handfull in the grounde. Which the Knights ſéeing that were talking with him, gathered about him, thinking he had bene ſlaine, and ſome went out to ſée what he was that had bene ſo hardie to do ſuch a déed: among whom was the Prince <hi>Perianeo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Emperour thinking it no wiſedome to oppoſe himſelfe againſt ſo many, cloſely thruſt among thoſe knights that were come thither, and ſo paſt till he came to the farther ſide of the Campe, at ſuch time that the Sunne beganne to appeare, and fearing ſome might méete and know him, and ſo fruſtrate his intent, he ruſhed with great violence vppon the guard on that ſide, and maugre their force, he paſſed through the middeſt of them, leauing aboue twentie, pitteouſly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the earth. And at length arriued in his owne Camp, where being ſtraight knowne, was with great gladneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and ſo entered the Cittie, where the Duke and all the reſt ioyfully welcommed him, and being demaunded for the valiant Knight of the golden Image, he replied, he departed from him at the Valley of the thrée Fountaines, and woulde quickly returne.</p>
               <p>So leauing them, he went to reſt himſelfe, for he greatly néeded it. The Prince <hi>Perianeo</hi> being come foorth of the Tent, thinking his father had bene ſlaine, inquiring for him that had done it, came to the place where the Emperour had made that ſlaughter, there he founde ſome dead, ſome gréeuouſly wounded, and ſome in ſuch caſe as they could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liue long, and demannding who had ſo handled them, they replied they knewe not, ſaue that a diuelliſh Knight clad in Armour, bearing certaine Crownes vpon his ſhield, had done thoſe wonders, and in deſpight of vs all, hath entred the Citie of <hi>Bollera.</hi>

though he much doubled it, becauſe his deare frined the wiſe <hi>Friſtone,</hi> had tolde him, he would ſet him in place, where hee ſhould leaue both honour and life: yet diſcontented and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed he returned to the Tent, where he found the Souldan vp, whereat he greatly reioyced, and with no little gladneſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded how he felt himſelfe, and whether the launce had done him any harme? None (replied the Souldan) but what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with feare of death, and I aſſuredly thinke that was the knight of the golden Image, for none elſe could haue the heart to do it. So great is the bountie of this knight, replied y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince) that none might do it but he. In theſe words you ſhall ſée it (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Souldane) for he that doth not ſée his déedes, will hardly beléeue them, my ſelf hauing ſéene him performe ſo hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie acts of Chiualry, which elſe none ſhould haue perſwaded me, that any humane creature could atchiue them: for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded, ſlue the horrible Dragon of the <hi>Ryphean</hi> deſart, and the King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> aſſuring you, that when he entered with him in the liſtes, the blood iſſued twixt the ioynts of his Armour from his olde woundes. He alſo diſcouered the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Diſpaire in Loue, with many other things which of him you haue heard. I long to try (replied the Prince) how farre his valour dooth extend. For I know not whether it be a Knight that did diſturbe me from ending a certaine Combat, and if it be he, I doo proteſt to procure all meanes til I méete with him.</p>

Do you know him, (ſaid the Souldan?) Yes (replied the Prince) for yeſterday I did Combat with him in the valley of the thrée Fountains. But how did you with him (ſaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoldan?)

But the couragious Emperour ſeeing his deare <hi>Sabiano</hi> in ſuch perill, in deſpight of them all, went where hée was fighting, and not knowing what <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianeo</hi> was, ouerthrew him to the ground with his horſe breſt, and alſo tumbling downe a Giant, tooke his horſe, and gaue it <hi>Sabeano,</hi> ſaying.

Which he did verie lightly, though he were ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and with their mortall blowes, they quickly cut their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through their enemes. The Prince <hi>Perianeo</hi> with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame rage foming like chaffed boare, taking a horſe turned againſt him whom had ouerthrowne him: but ere he did it, the Souldan, and the Duke <hi>Alfiron</hi> méeting, and knowing each other, diſcharged two ſuch blowes vpon themſelues, that their heads were both wounded, from whence there ran much blood. The duke here had incurred great danger, if the Emperor had not arriued with his companie, who knowing the Soldane, came ſo nigh, that raiſing his ſworde to ſtrike him being ſo cloſe vnto him, did no otherwiſe, but with the hiltes throw him off his horſe, and going after to kill him, was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached backwardes by the Prince <hi>Periance,</hi> with ſo cruell a ſtroke, that he had fallen downe. <hi>Coroliano</hi> wounded him alſo vppon the ſhoulder, that hee felt the ſworde raſe his fleſh. Wherevpon there began ſo cruell a fight betwéene them, that one ſide to take the Soldane, and another to defende him, aboue foure thouſande knights loſt their liues through theyr obſtinacie.

Which troupe went towards the gallant princeſſe <hi>Florisbella,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was diſcourſing with her father about the tent, and being before her, they all kneeled, refuſing to riſe both at her, and the Emperors intreaties.

Gods doo emmulate through the incomparable beautie of his excellent Daughter, for whoſe ſake, his Empyre ſhall ſtill aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with eternall happineſſe, to perpetuall ages. Know, that the deare hope to finde redreſſe for our troubled thoughts, hath brought vs to this imperiall Cittie, where if our hopes bee fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of theyr deſires, we will returne diſpayring of future, remedie for our gréefes, wanting it here, where neuer any was denied.</p>
               <p>Wherefore of thée, and of this glorious Princeſſe, wee muſt obtaine a boone, before we do explayne the cauſe of our comming. Require what you will (ſaid the Souldane) for my deſire is ſo great to knowe this aduenture, that not onely one, but twentie, I doo graunt you: and therefore make vs partakers of your gréeuances. Whereuppon they roſe, and the Damozell returning to her former purpoſe, thus ſaide.</p>
               <p>In yonder Tent (moſt dread Lord) is the valiaunt King <hi>Gorgiana, of Soria,</hi> théefe Lord of that Land, whome you well knowe, béeing your néere Ally, that being in his peacefull king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ordering of certaine Tryumphs, wherein himſelfe with moſt of his beſt knights ſhoulde bee in, thyther came many ſtraungers, and forreiners, brought by the fame of his beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Daughter, then thought the fayreſt Lady liuing. And among many that there arriued, ſhee was demaunded of her father for wife, by the great Magician, <hi>Herodiano,</hi> king of the Ile of pearles, one of the braueſt Gyants hitherto ſéene. But he being informed what he was, returned him, that his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being too young, was not determined yet to marrie: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he craued his pardon. Which anſwer, highly vexing <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodiano,</hi> that they being the nezt day in the ordained Jouſtes, there appeared on the one ſide of the field, theſe foure Knights that here you ſée, who ruſhing within the Tourney, in ſhort ſpace ouerthrew aboue one hundred Knights, with ſuch déepe woundes, that moſt of them could no more riſe. And they like furious Dragons ranne vp and downe the fielde, that none
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4771:125"/>
durſt abide their furie. Which the King ſéeing, encountred them with tenne knights, againſt whom onely thrée went, and the other imbraced the King in ſuch cruell manner, that both fell downe, and the reſt left his Knights deadly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Then on the ſuddaine, appeared the Tent you yonder ſée, in which the king was ſet, with his Daughter, and theſe foure knights remained as their kéepers, whome no humaine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is able to ouerrome, becauſe they are inchannted: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of foure dayes, they vanquiſhed aboue foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand knights that came to liberate their king, which not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle gréeued vs. But in the ende, ſending for the counſaile of a wiſe man, a great fréend vnto our king, wee receined this aunſwere: that the impriſonment of the king and his daughter could not be remedied, but by a Ladie, whoſe beautie ſhould excell the honourable Princeſſe <hi>Meridianaes,</hi> and that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her, ſhe ſhould prooue the aduenture of the Tent, in which the Princeſſe would giue her a ſworde, which in her hand ſhe holdeth, with which thoſe knights ſhould be vanquiſhed, and the inchantment ended. Hnd for this effect, he would worke, that the Tent ſhoulde bee brought where we would wiſhe to haue it, wherein wee foure might very ſafelye goe, for onely theſe ſame knights ſhoulde bee our chéefe defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>In this manner haue we in ſhort time trauailed through moſt part of <hi>Paganiſme,</hi> but neuer could finde any that did ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the beautie of our Princeſſe <hi>Meridiana.</hi> And by the way, hearing the fame propogated through this Eaſterne world, of the rare, and ſoly excellent beautie of the Princeſſe thy deare Daughter, we are hither come to intreat thée to ſuffer this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture tryed in thy court, which will no little enternize thy great glorie, ſetting an end to our many toiles, which we haue, and elſe ſhall ſuſtaine. And this is the boone which you and your excellent Daughter the princeſſe <hi>Florisbella</hi> haue gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs.</p>

This done, the inchaunted knightes began to range about the field, that within a whyle they left none to withſtand them, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no more to do, returned ſo quietlie to their tent, as if they had done nothing. The Soldan greatly amazed at this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine exployte, had farre more deſire then before to haue the aduenture ended, wherefore firſt commanded the dead and wounded knights to bée carryed away, and then willed the Ladies to trye their Fortunes, highlie praiſing the knightes valour, thinking them inuincible.

not what knight will bée ſo hardie, as to attempt ſo haughtie an interpryze, vnleſſe it bée the knight of the Images, of whom I beleeue you ſhall obtaine nothing againſt me. Al this know, I (anſwered the Infante.) But I haue a knight in theſe partes, that farre excells him, both in valiantcie and faireneſſe. How know you that (ſaid the Princeſſe) for I neuer heard any ſuch thing. Ile tell you (replyed the Infant.) To my Fathers kingdome there came a meſſenger, that brought a letter from the Sophy, father vnto the Prince <hi>Perianeo,</hi> requiring his ayde, to bée reuenged of a ſubiect of his, that with the helpe of a knight, called of the golden Image, had ſlayne his Sonne in law, the Prince <hi>Don Gallaneo,</hi> and had ſtolne his daughter <hi>Perſiana,</hi> and recounted ſuch wonders of this knight, and of his rare beautie, which hardlie we beléeue, but that wée were informed thereof by other meanes. And this knight will I haue to defend my beautie, which netwithſtanding, I feare he will not, for I haue heard he beareth your picture grauen on his ſhield. I am ſtrooke into a great amazement (aunſwered the Princeſſe) with your diſcourſe, and cannot comprehend that any Knight in the world, would bée ſo madde, to preſume to beautifie his armour with my portrature. And I aſſure you, if he heere arriueth, he ſhall doo much to ſaue his head, in recompence of his preſumption. Trouble not your ſelfe with any ſuch thought (ſaid the Infant) for you would much more gréeue, if you ſhould ſée all this place full of vanquiſhed knights in my behalfe. In this manner chatted theſe two Mirors of rare beautie, till they approached the rich tent, where there ſences were rauiſhed with the rare melodious Muſicke that thence ſounded: and parting handes, the beauteous <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> entred the tent, where one of thoſe Knightes tooke her by the hand, and brought her to the ſteppes: whereon the infant cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly began to mount. All the beholders iudged the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ended: which not a little gréeued the Princeſſe, becauſe ſhe had not firſt tryed it. But ſhe had not aſcended the third ſteppe, when ſhe felt her ſelfe ſtayed, and ſtriuing to go vppe, ſhe ſuddenly found her ſelfe without the Tent, to her greate

I knowe not what to aunſwere (ſaid the pleaſant Infant but that no truſt is to bée repoſed in theſe inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, béeing onely made according to their Authors minde: yet trye you it, that we may ſée your merits, for it may be, your companie would leſſen my gréefe. The Princeſſe going to trie the aduenture, ſhée ſawe entred by the farther ſide of the field, a Knight in a gréene Armour, very rich, with many golden Baſſiliſkes thereon, whoſe gallant diſpoſition more contented her, then any the euer ſawe. In his ſhield was drawne her picture ſo naturall, that it ſéemed aliue: by his ſide did ride an auncient Ladie maſkt, bringing in her hands a naked ſword, ſo bright, that it look like a tranſparant glaſſe of fine Chriſtall, ſet againſt the Sunne: which ſhe ſeeing, ſtayed herſelfe. The Knight and the Ladie went ſtraight to the tent. But <hi>Friſtone</hi> ſéeing them at firſt enter in the field, began to make his coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, not knwowing who they were, nor to what end they came, nor neuer could knowe it, becauſe <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> had on the Emperour <hi>Broudezars</hi> armour: and the ſage <hi>Bellona,</hi> which was ſhe that came with him, carryed the ſame Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſword: yet hée ſtraight knewe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Princeſſe did ſo, with ſuch amazement by the feare, that ſhée knowe not in what world ſhe was. The like happened the infant <hi>Mattaroſo.</hi> But <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> béeing aduertiſed of <hi>Bellona</hi> what hée ſhould doo, ſtepped to the Tent, where hée was aſſaulted by the foure inchauntred Knightes, with ſuch hardineſſe, that they put him in great extremitie, for though by vertue of his ſword, their inchauntment preuayled not againſt him, yet were they very valiant and couragious. But the Prince ſéeing himſelfe before his Lady, and conſidering that to bée the firſt battell in her ſeruice, ſo handled his aduerſaries, cutting armour, fleſh and all, himſelfe ſuſtaining great labour, and the loſſe of blood. The Princeſſe trembled for very feare, thinking ſhe ſhould bee put in like danger againe. The infant <hi>Mattaroſa</hi> that was more hardie, ſaid. What thinke you (faire Couſen) of yonder knight? Surely I thinke it is he that I tolde you of, for by the deuiſe of his ſhield, and the report of him, I doe not doubt it. We ſhall now know it (replyed the Princeſſe:) But let vs intreate our Gods to frée him from the daunger he is in for our ſakes. And therewith looked to the fight, wherein the knight had brought his aduerſaries to ſuch a paſſe, that they had almoſt fallen, whereuppon their iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued foorth of the Tent two mightie Gyants, that aſſaulted the Prince, giuing him ſuch blowes, that they made his head kiſſe the ſaddle pummell. But he with double force (increaſed with his rage) ſo behaued him with them, that hee threwe two of the Knights dead to the ground. And ſéeing the battell ſo long indured, reſolued to enter within the tent in diſpight of them, knowing that if he did it, the fight would ceaſe, &amp; the inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment end.</p>
               <p>The Knights and Gyants perceiuing it, layde faſte holde on him, but he béeing of mightie and vnmatched forces, mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre their power went in with them, and with his ſword hée gaue ſo hard a blowe vpon the ſteppes, that hee mad a darke

The ſtately paſſage of her féete, no more ſéemed to moue, then the gentle blaſt of the milde blowing winde. The Princeſſe <hi>Mataroſa</hi> was attired in that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whoſe perfection had no equall, in the abſence of her faire Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin. In this maner arriued they, where the Souldan was talking with the Princeſſe <hi>don Bellianis,</hi> who ſeeing the excellency of his Lady, that farre excelled the portrayture of his ſhield, reſted ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with admiration, that his braue heart vnable to reſiſt ſo fierce an aſſault, all couered with a cold ſweat, as if that were the laſt moment of his life, loſt his ſences, that had not the Souldane (who thought ſome mortall wounde had cauſed it) held him faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the necke, he had fallen to the ground: yet notwithſtanding he was in ſuch a traunce, that he felt nothing that was done vnto him.

                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:4771:130"/>While they were thus talking, the Soldan knew <hi>Bellona,</hi> whom with great ioy he imbraced, ſhe would haue kiſſed his and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe hands, but the Soldan wold not ſuffer it, ſaying. Why haue your (deare friend) kept your ſelfe away ſo long time, not viſiting vs? for I know no cauſe you had for it, but now ſhal you pay for al, not departing ſo eaſily as you thinke. And I pray you tell, who is this valorous knight y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> comes with you? for I am ſure, you knew of our diſtreſſe, ſéeing you came in ſo great time of need. The wiſe woman made this reply. You ſay true (dread Lord) for knowing your danger, and that ſurely you had loſt the princeſſe your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I vndertooke this iourny, impoſing ſo great a danger vpon this knight, as he vnderwent by our comming. And beléeue me, his equall liues not this day in the world, and without him, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming had bene in vaine: and hitherto I did not viſit you, becauſe you had no néed of me. I beléeue it (replied the Souldane) and now that our ioy may be compleat, I pray you make this knight vnlace his helme, and remaine here ſome fewe dayes, for it would greatly vex me, if ſuch a knight ſhuld go from my Court vnknowne. This muſt be pardoned (ſaid ſhe) for he muſt depart vnknown: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you do not importune him about it, for it cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. Hereupon they went where the two Princeſſes <hi>Floriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> &amp; <hi>Mataroſa</hi> were chatting with <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> intreating him to put off his helme. Wherupon the Souldan ſaid. If you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no more then hitherto you haue done of this knight, I beléeue he will depart vnknowne. He will not ſo much wrong vs, (ſaid the Princeſſe vnleſſe he will haue vs make litle account of his ayd we receiued. And ſeeing he faith he will do what this Lady doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him, I hope ſhe will not leaue vs ſo vnſatiſfied, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of her long abſence. I do beſéech your excellency (ſaid <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) not to vexe your ſelfe: for I aſſure you, if he now diſcouer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it will coſt him no leſſe then his life, in lieu of the pleaſure he ſhould do you therein. And let this ſuffiſe, which according to our power we haue done. But yet in reſpect of this diſpleaſure, I doo certifie you, that your couſin the Princeſſe <hi>Aurora</hi> is wel (though ſorrowfull, wanting your company,) ſhe we left in <hi>Perſia,</hi> with the Ladies you ſent to ſéeke her, and thither muſt we goe ſhortly.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4771:130"/>
This hath greatly comforted me (ſaid ſhe) yet reſt not altogither ſatiſfied, wanting the effect of this my deſire. I cannot expreſſe the oppreſſion of my gréeued heart (moſt excellent and ſupreme Lady) ſaid <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> to haue ſo yoked the libertie of my condition to a ſtranger power, that I cannot now, though it were with the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daunger of my life, ſatiſfie the deare obedience of your high commaund: for I haue ſo tyed my ſelfe to anothers will, that I muſt not do more then what this Lady here ſhall appoint me. But I do proteſt and promiſe you, by our high immortall Gods, (hauing freed my libertie,) to returne with all ſpéede to ſerue you, and the Souldan your father, whence I will not part, but by your commaund: in token whereof, I do beſeech you accept this King, which coſt me no litle labour, with abundant loſſe of my blood, to obtaine it. Wherewith you ſhall be ſafe and ſure of any ſuch acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as this laſt. And taking off his Gaunlets, diſcouered the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſter whiteneſſe of his hands. The Princeſſe heart was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abaſhed, adding more beautie, to her beautie, by the roſeat tincture of a vermillion bluſh, not knowing whether ſhe ſhould take the King which the knight preſented her, thinking ſhée ſhould thereby do him a greater fauour then ſhe would. Which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Mataroſa</hi> perceiuing, being greatly ſatiſfied with the knights behauiour, ſaid vnto her. What doth your highneſſe doubt? why do you not accept the precious gift of this valourous knight? wold you ſée vs euery day in like daunger? which if you deſire, I aſſure you we ſhall not euery day haue ſo good helpe: for though I ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome perill, yet was there none that ſuccoured me. Receiue this gift (daughter) ſaid the Souldane, for it is no ſmall thing to kéepe the pledge of ſo valiant a knight. All this while the diſcréete Princeſſe, holding downe her eyes, gazed on <hi>don Bellianis</hi> hand, thinking with her ſelfe, that if his face, with the diſpoſition of his bodie, did agree with it, the whole world could not affoord a gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not better knight, of whoſe valour, ſhe was ſufficient witneſſe. And ſéeing her Image on his ſhield, imagined this was the knight whoſe praiſes her couſin had ſo inhouſed.

that hauing no defenſiue proofe, nor the ſhielde of reaſon to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, but vnprouided, aſſaulted by his ſubtiltie, yéelded at the firſt encounter, reſting ſo vanquiſhed, that ſhe neuer had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to recouer the former libertie of her heart. And the more ſhée thought on him, the more ſhe did inſnare her ſelfe, as the diſccurſe of this preſent booke mentioneth, for no ſmall forments this vnſéen ſight of <hi>don Bellianis</hi> Couſin here, and with a ſuddaine ioy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by her thoughts, dying her beautie to make it more faire, with the colour of an <hi>Orient</hi> Ruby. Firſt, thinking that her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commaund, and her Couſins perſwaſions, were ſufficient armour to ſhield her from after ſcandall: with lowly courteſie on both parts, ſhe tooke the King, ſaying. I do receiue (Sir Knight,) this preſent at your hands, leſt it be ſaide, I do deny the grateſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I owe, for the good turne you did, and taking poſſeſſion of this which is the leaſt, you ſhall remaine bounde to that which is the moſt, I meane your ſpeedie returne, to attend the Souldane my dread Soueraigne: and becauſe you ſhall not forget it, I will kéepe this as a pledge, left me, by you, as alſo in remembrance of her, that againſt my will doth lead you away, before you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued any ſigne of guerdon of my father. Yet before you goe, I pray you let vs know the daungerous deceit we had like to fall in. I do moſt humbly beſéech you, (ſole preſident of diuine excellency) ſaid <hi>(Don Bellianis)</hi> to let me kiſſe the wonder of your handes, that I may thereby enioy the fruition of ſo high a fauour as you haue done, in the acceptance of the ſmall gift of ſo meane a Knight as I am, in reſpect of your highneſſe. Againe, promiſing my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne ſhall be ſo ſhortly, as the obedience of your commaund re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, vnleſſe my hopes be fruſtrated by death: and turning to <hi>Bellona,</hi> intreated her, ſéeing ſhe knew the beginning and end of that aduenture, ſhe wold fully ſatiſfie the Princeſſe therin. Which ſhe did, in manner alreadie ſet downe. And hauing done, craued leaue to depart. And ſo kiſſing the Souldans hands, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>Siluiana</hi> bad them and the Princeſſes farewell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> did the like, with ſuch griefe (as any in his caſe may imagine) leauing his heart with the Princeſſe, and for it, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away hers. The Princeſſe Mataroſa pleaſantly ſaid thus vnto

the Prince. I do beleeue ſir Knight, that the Sage <hi>Bellona</hi> hath ſo maiſtered you, that you ſpeake not but when it pleaſeth her, and if it be ſo, tell it me? for I preſume to obtaine leaue of her, for your tongue to play. <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> that through his great amazement had net ſeene her, but ſeeing her, replied. This hath not bene the cauſe of my ſilent ouerſight, (courteous and pleaſant Lady but the imaginations of the ſight there ſéene, which with my ſuddaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture hath ſo increaſed my admiration, and ſo intrapt me in my owne thoughts, that they haue ſuffered me not to regard the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued merits of your worthie perſon, robbing the power of my ſpéech, to conſound me more in the déep conſideration of my harts ſubiection. Then belike the fault is very litle (anſwered ſhe) by the ſpéedie redreſſing of our daunger, wearing ſo good an armour as that. The preſent blindneſſe (deare Lady ſaid he) is better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue my future ſight. At your returne, you ſhall explaine me this (ſaid ſhe) for now I do not vnderſtand it. Whereupon the braue Prince <hi>don Bellianis</hi> mounted a horſbacke, not ſetting his foote in the ſtirrope, as was his cuſtome, and very gallantly managing him, he made him bende his knées vnto the earth: and bending downe his owne head in ſigne of his dutie, departed in maner as he came, with vnſpeakable ioy, to haue ſo happily finiſhed that aduenture before his Lady, to his immortall glorie, which were it not tempered with griefe of his departure, it had bene inough to kill him.

               <p>THe Princeſſe <hi>Florisbella,</hi> remained ſo amazed with the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine departure of the new Louer, that ſo quickly had made a praie of her tender hart, that all her imaginations, were on nought but of <hi>Don Bellianis,</hi> and till he went cleane out of the field, ſhe accompanied him with her ſight, ſo ſtedfaſtly fixing her eyes after him, that had not her couſin called her away to follow the Souldane and Empreſſe that were returning to the Court, there ſhe had ſtaied, forgetfull of her ſelfe. The Infant <hi>Mataroſa,</hi> ſaid vnto her by the way: What ſay you (faire Couſin) to that great knight? did you euer ſée in all your life a man of more valor? And truſt me, I thinke it be he I told you of, a iltle before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.

I know not what I ſhould ſay (replied the Princeſſe) for he hath not ſéemed ſo well in my eyes, and though his valour haue freed me from the daunger you ſawe, great is his preſumption notwithſtanding, to beare my picture with him about the world, and his diſcurteſie is no leſſe, to depart vnknowne vnto the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan my father, and nothing reſpecting our intreaties, leauing mee ſo diſcontented, and I had not taken his ring, had not my father co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

If (replyed <hi>Palineo</hi>) wée dye in this enterprize, wée ſhall not néede our Horſes: but if wée ſcape, liberating according to our deſire, our friend <hi>Damartyno,</hi> the matter will be leſſe, in looſing them. <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> replying ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a word, armed himſelfe, and carrying his Helme in his hand, put on the ſhepheards cloake, which <hi>Palineo</hi> had before woorne, who ſaid vnto him: You paſſe me, in diſguiſing your ſelfe, incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no leſſe daunger, then I doe: for if with the many lightes I be known by mine armor, in the Pallace, you are like to ſuffer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me. But what ſhal wée do (ſaid <hi>don Bryanel?</hi>) There can we do no otherwiſe (replyed he) but in the cittie we way better ſhift. And being come thither, by the way they met two or three Pages, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineo</hi> ſtepped to one, and taking him by the cloake, made as hée would drawe his ſword, the Page feared therewith, left it him, and got away, crying out, they would murther him.

What ſay you to this? (ſaide <hi>Palineo:</hi>) hée that hath nothing, muſt ſhift to get it with little labour. Nowe ſo the Godes helpe mée (ſaid <hi>Don Bryanell</hi>) it was well done, and the quickneſſe you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it with, makes me thinke you haue not a feawe times vſed it.

               <p>In this manner arriued they at laſte in the Pallace (after the clocke had ſtrooke twelue) where the King was yet at Supper,

and méeting with the Captaine of the kings guard, thinking they belonged to the Countie, demaunded whence at that time they came.

So they paſte, till they came to the Mine, and ſéeing none was by, opened the locke, and went in, and chayning the doore faſte on the inſide with lockes and chaines, they found there, and féeling with their hands, went along: And by the way <hi>Palineo</hi> ſaid.

And if not replied <hi>don Brianell</hi>) our ſwordes ſhall breake it open You ſay well (aunſwered <hi>Palineo</hi>) and therefore let vs ſoftlie go to the Caſtle Gate, and that none heare vs, make it ſure, that neither by the one, nor by the other, if we preuaile, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may beare the newes: and ſo going thither, <hi>Palineo</hi> tooke a handfull of earth and caſt in the lockes, through the keye holes, that it was impoſſible without breaking, to open them.</p>

                  <hi>Don Briaenll</hi> perceiuing that the knight threatned him, made no anſwere, but rained his horſe about, cowching his Lance to méete his aduerſarie, who was nothing ſlack to doo the like.

But what ſhall we doo? for thinking to finde you in neceſſitie, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and vs, ſhipt our ſelues with one hundred thouſand men, which are not farre from hence. For knowing you were come to reſtore the Princeſſe <hi>Aurora</hi> to her kingdome, we departed to aid you.</p>
               <p>Where left you my Lord the Emperour, demaunded <hi>Don Bryanell?</hi> He is not with vs? I aſſure you (anſwere <hi>Lucidamore</hi>) for he and <hi>Sauian</hi> of <hi>Trebento</hi> were ſeparated from vs, by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aduenture. All this talked they, that <hi>Damartyno</hi> and <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo</hi> did not vnderſtand, though they thought they knew one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>don Brianell</hi> ſaid to the Princes, it behooueth you to ſay, that the Souldan of <hi>Babilon</hi> hath ſent this armie, to plant the Princeſſe <hi>Aurora,</hi> in her kingdome, that theſe knights may more willingly further vs: for in theſe affaires, they are very forward. Is my brother here, demanded <hi>Don Clarianeo,</hi> and my Couſin, the Prince <hi>Arfileo?</hi> I left them in <hi>Perſia</hi> (replied <hi>Don Brianell</hi>) in a bloodie controuerſie againſt the Souldane, about the death of <hi>Don Galfeo</hi> of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Is it poſſible ſaid <hi>(Don Clarianeo?)</hi> I aſſure you, you haue greatly gladded me with the death of that traytor: but tell me, did my brother <hi>Don Bellianis</hi> kill him?

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Don Brianell</hi> called to him <hi>Palineo,</hi> (that was much abaſhed at his fall) and ſaid to him and <hi>Damartyno.</hi> You are (ſir knights) to giue the immortal gods great thanks, for direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our affaires better then wee wiſhed, for theſe knights are my néere kinſmen, and for whome I would vndertake any danger in the world. I ſpeake this Syr <hi>Palineo,</hi> becauſe you ſhould not vex your ſelfe at your chance, nor diminiſh your good will towards me, for what is paſt. And beſides all this, they are come about the ſame matter (we haue in hand) landing a ſtrong army, ſent to this end, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Soldan of <hi>Babilon:</hi> which wil not a litle help vs, being

               <p>I could not haue receiued greater comfort for my ouerthrowe then this, being done by ſuch a knight, and your Allye, for which cauſe, he onely deſerueth to gain the honor of all aduentures in the world: &amp; therfore do I remain no leſſe bound to his ſeruice, though I beleeue he little néedes it, then heretofore I was to yours. I doo greatly thanke you (Sir knight) ſaid <hi>Don Clarineo,</hi> thinking my ſelfe happie to haue met you, and do reioyce we came not to handy blowes, being ſure to haue béene vanquiſhed by you, as your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous words, ſufficiently do ſhewe. And therefore, I do ſurrender all the honour of the victorie to you, as your due, and reſting yours for euer, as my future déedes ſhall approoue. And ſo imbracing one another, expeld all enuious rancor from their valiant hearts. This done, <hi>Damartyno</hi> ſaid: he thought good, they all returned to the Caſtle, whence that morning they were returned, where they might conclude what ſhould be performed, and that in the meane while, one of the Pages ſhould goe and charge the Armie to ſtay where they had left it, till they receiued farther order. This counſaile being alowed, they ſent two of theyr pages with this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and themſelues returned to the Caſtle, where hauing reſted that day, they reſolued that the prince <hi>Don Lucidamore</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martyno,</hi> ſhould that night goe vnto the army, and before the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light, they ſhuld co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct cloſe to the walles of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which they alreadie knew to be in armes, with aboue one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men, becauſe by their ſpyes they were aduertiſed of their power, and the vſurping king accounting them to bee ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, determined to méete them in field, yet commanding the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie gates to be faſt ſhut, leaſt vnwares it ſhuld be ſurpriſed, leauing within 40. thouſand men to defend it.

(Sir knight) the Gyant is gone, with all his companie, let vs now followe him, doing as the time ſhall miniſter occaſion. They did ſo, thruſting themſelues among thoſe that were going to the walles, where arriuing, they ſaw the gate faſte ſhutte, which they had determined to open, and that the Gyant hauing paſte a Gariſon there, was going to ſpeake with the County <hi>Gariano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I beléeue (ſaid <hi>Palineo</hi>) wee ſhall haue more adoo to open the Gate, then wée had thought. I haue (aunſwered <hi>don Clarineo</hi>) conſidered, how we may doo it: which is, that your Couſen (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>don Bryanell</hi>) ſhall kéepe the paſſage from the Mine, letting no more paſſe hither: and that you (Sir <hi>Palineo</hi>) ſhall by force take the keyes from the Porter, and with them, procure to open the gate, and I will defend you, from theſe that are alreadie here: And this muſt be with the ſpéede, that the valour of our courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hearts, and their charge we haue enterpriſed, doth binde vs to. Whereupon <hi>don Brianell</hi> ſetled himſelfe in the paſſage, which being narrowe, he could ſcarce defend himſelfe. <hi>Palineo</hi> with greate courage, by the light of many torches, that were kindled, ſtepped to the Porter, and with his ſword cleaning his head in two, at one blowe, ſnatcht the keyes from his ſide, but ere he did it, many knightes aſſaulted him, to giue him his death. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Prince <hi>don Clarineo,</hi> not forgetting what he had to do, ſtept before, to defend him, beſtowing ſo mightie and mortall blowes, on euery one which approched, that they fledde from him, as from the preſence of death. By this time had <hi>Palineo,</hi> through his ſpéedie diligence, opened the gate, had not the fearefull <hi>Tramo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leano</hi> (hearing that ſuddaine accident thrre) with an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of knights, returned with his heauie Mace, tamming w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch a furie, that if <hi>don Clarineo</hi> had not ſtepped behinde the dead horſes and knightes, that he had ſlaine, he had wondrouſly ſcaped his life, at that firſt fury of the horſes incounters, but dooing as is ſaid, he wounded the mightie Gyants horſe, thruſting his ſword quite through his head, that the furious beaſt, in ſuch manner rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

And certainely, they could not haue giuen two better blows, then theſe, that more might helpe them. For when the Gyants knights, that were about a hundred, ſawe their maiſters downe, alighted alſo, becauſe the narrowneſſe of the place might not be a cauſe to hurt them, with their horſes. The fearefull Gyant being very heauie, with great gaine rayſed himſelfe, and foming through his mouth, blaſpheming all his Gods, went againſt <hi>Clarineo,</hi> who being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Don Brianell,</hi> were both in a fierce ſkermidge, giuing, and receiuing mightie blowes, whoſe eecho rezounded in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> campe without the cittie. And the gyant ſeeing him there, reſht in, to hold him, whyle his men did kill him, but hauing no aduantage in ſtrength ouer him, <hi>don Clarineo</hi> to ſcape from his handes, braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie pluckt him to him, that both fell downe, where hee was pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wounded, and had not his ſtrong armour defended him, he there had left his life. And getting from the Gyant, he began with them a moſt cruell fight (with ſuch danger as any may imagine.) Whom <hi>Palineo</hi> ſéeing ſo fore wounded, wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred how he breathed. <hi>Don Bryanell</hi> was in no leſſe perill, for ſo many layd on him, with haſte to paſſe by, that he bléeded as faſt as any of them. In this daunger were they all thrée, looking for nothing but death, though the King and <hi>Trapter County,</hi> were wounded no leſſe then they. For <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> minding to leaue his life reuenged, ſo laide on them, and others, that all were imbrues in their owne bloods. And whoſoeuer then had ſéene them, would haue rather iudged them ſo many raging Tigers, or hungrie Lions, then knights, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of no ſuccor of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without: for thogh they procured to enter, could not approch the gates, being defended by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyants gariſon. While this thus paſte, at ſuch time as the giuer of the bright light illuminated the darke night, there came downe a valley, not farre from the cittie, a mightie piller of fire, &amp; after it, followed a knight, with two of the vglieſt gyants, that euer were ſéene, who with ſuch furious ſpéede (as doth a thunderbolt breake through the aire) approached to the Wall, and ſette a Ladder againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:4771:144"/>The knight that came with them, whoſe armor was all garniſhed with Baſiliſks, alighted from his horſe, and without let of any that were below, he mounted thereon to the top of the wall, where he beſtowed ſuch deadly blowes, that ere they were aware of him, he had tumbled aboue fiftie ouer it dead. <hi>Don Lucidamore,</hi> that ſuch haughtie proweſſe ſaw in one Knight, leauing his armie to <hi>Damartynos</hi> charge, quickly climed the ladder, and ſcarcely was he on the top, when the giants taking it, returned the way, and in the maner they did come, leauing the beholders amazed with wonder. The knight of the Baſiliſke comming, inſtructed in what he ſhould do, deſcended certaine ſteps of ſtone that were in the wall, beating downe on both ſides many knights before him, clearing the way for <hi>don Lucidamore,</hi> that followed him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no leſſe ſlaughter then he, on that rebellious people. At length he arriued at the gate where <hi>don Brianell</hi> was, wearie and tyred, who ſeeing the Knight of the Baſiliſkes, thinking him to be one of his enemies, ſtrooke him a mightie blow, but he knowing him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it with his ſheeld, and ruſht in where he was: there ſpied he <hi>Clarineo,</hi> that had before him aboue thirtie Kinges ſlaine, and then with one blowe, threwe the Countie <hi>Gariano</hi> dead to the earth, but was in extreame daunger, becauſe he looked to the truſty <hi>Palineo,</hi> who through the much blood he had loſt, was in a trance, that he was faine to beare him cloſe to the wall, where he kept him before, himſelfe making ſtupendious déedes. And there arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thr knight of the Baſiliſks, in the Gréekiſh tongue he ſayde. Courage, braue knight: for you are alreadie ſuccoured. At the ende of which words, with one mightie blowe he cut off the Giants leg, that he fell downe, where he breathed his laſt, and beating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the knights about him, he quickly freed that Gate, ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping both vnto the Portall thereof, where <hi>Lucidamore,</hi> and <hi>don Brianell</hi> were. And the troopes that were without, ſéeing they could not enter in, had ouerthrowne all that ſide, making a great breach in the wall, through which ten knights might eaſily paſſe togither, with ſuch furie preſſing in, that they extreamely were oppreſſad. Defend you this entrie (ſaid <hi>don Clarineo,</hi>) to the knight of the Baſiliſke) while I open yonder gate, which he did
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:4771:144"/>
ſo brauely, that in deſpight of them that firſt arriued, he firſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw aboue fiue hundred dead, and deadly wounded, making the reſt giue place vnto his puiſſant ſtrokes. <hi>Don Clarineo</hi> went to <hi>Palineo</hi> for the Keyes, which he by no means would let go cut of his handes, and with them opened the gate. Which beeing ſéene of the campe, with great clamours approached to enter into the Citie.
