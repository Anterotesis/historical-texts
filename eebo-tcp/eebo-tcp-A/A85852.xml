            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>perfectly ſcandalized againſt all</hi> Auxiliary Beauty <hi>(which applies any colouring or tincture to ſet off</hi> the Face) <hi>that I condemned this peice (after the mode of vulgar and</hi> precipitant zeal) unread, <hi>and</hi> unheard, <hi>to be</hi> burned, <hi>as</hi> Judah <hi>did</hi> Tamar, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 24. <hi>concluding it to be the</hi> Eſſay <hi>of ſome wanton wit &amp; idle pen; wihch was more a</hi> paraſite <hi>to female foole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and vanitys, than a lover of priſtine gravity, and ſobriety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet by a principle of</hi> innate Juſtice <hi>which I owe to</hi> Selfe-preſervation, <hi>(making me very loth to be hanged without a</hi> legall tryall) <hi>I was ſecretly aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to condemn it, till I had made ſome examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its guilt. Hence I ventured the loſſe of ſo much time, as to arraigne and read it: Which act of high</hi> Juſtice <hi>(before I had farre advanced) taught me, to my great</hi> reproach and ſhame, <hi>how</hi> unjuſt Judges, <hi>how</hi> cruell Tyrants, Prejudice <hi>and</hi> Cuſtome <hi>are, which condemn all they diſaffect, and diſaffect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they underſtand; And are loth to underſtand, contrary to prepoſſeſsions: Like</hi> Procruſtes, <hi>either cropping or ſtretching all new commers to the ſtinted meaſure of their wonted fancies and opinions.</hi>

               </choice> (as all others in this diſpute) do much referre: Nor am I a ſtranger to that gloſſe or obſervation thence made againſt all paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or tincturing of the face, by that <hi>moſt worthy Prelate;</hi> with whoſe ſo quick and ſharp a ſtroke I was (at firſt reading that paſſage) ſo ſtartled, that I had no reſt, till I adviſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114687:8"/>
with another perſon, of great judgement and and ſober piety: who made it clear to me, That that excellent Biſhop, however then he thought ſit (after the wonted oratory and freedome of ſome of <hi>the Fathers)</hi> to make a a <hi>popular paſſe,</hi> or ſtroke of his <hi>potent pen,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what he might ſuſpect to be then much uſed, and abuſed too, in the Engliſh world; yet (for certain) he was too wiſe and judicious a <hi>Divine,</hi> to fix that ſignall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy judgement of God, onely, or chiefly, (or indeed at all) upon <hi>Jezebels painting;</hi> which was an after act; and as to that time or inſtant in the ſtory, comes at leaſt 14. years behind that dreadful doom which was by the <hi>prophet Eliſha</hi> foretold upon the ſcore of <hi>Naboths</hi> blood unjuſtly ſhed, &amp; his inheritance cruelly uſurped: which is 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 23. So that her <note place="margin">1 Kings 21. 23.</note> 
               <hi>painting her eyes or face,</hi> mentioned in the place you urge, is indeed (among other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionall circumſtances) recorded, but to a farre different end or uſe; than either to lay the weight of the ſubſequent puniſhment, or the guilt of any ſin upon that act more than upon the other concomitant actions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with recited.</p>
            <p>§. Among which this of her <hi>painting</hi> is indeed ſet down chiefly, to ſhew; That no advantages of outward Beauty, naturall, or artificiall, (though ſet off with the curioſity &amp;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114687:9"/>
Majeſty of a Queen) are ſufficient to make any perſon the object of either love or pity: where foul and enormous ſins have ſo deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and deformed their ſouls to God; As <hi>Murther, Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſsion</hi> had done <hi>Jezebels;</hi> For which ſins (as is expreſly ſaid) that Tragedy befell her (which was foretold long before ſhe is brought in ſo dreſſed and adorned); which thunderbolt <hi>of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> ſhe in vain ſought to diſarm or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void by uſing any charms, attractives or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitives of outward beauty, if that were her deſigne: which truly is not very probable, at her years; and toward <hi>Jehu,</hi> a declared enemy: Nor do indeed the actions of <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel ſignifie</hi> (as that gentleman told me) any <hi>amorous intention</hi> whereby to allure <hi>Jehu;</hi> ſince her words reproach him with ſo juſt and bitter a Sarcaſme as that is, <hi>Had Zimri peace who ſlew his maſter!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ So that <hi>Jezebel</hi> at this time ſeems rather reſolved not ſo much to court, as to ſcorn <hi>Jehu:</hi> diſdaining to deprecate her ruine; or ow her life to ſuch an enemy. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe puts her ſelf into a poſture of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: as ſhewing that height and greatneſſe of mind, which could own her ſelf in the pomp &amp; ſplendor of a Princeſſe, even then when ſhe expected her enemy and her end; That ſhe might at leaſt periſh (as ſhe thought) with the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114687:9"/>
more reputation of a <hi>comely perſon</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted ſpirit;</hi> which abhorred to humble and abaſe it ſelf, after the manner of fearfull and ſqualid ſuppliants in ſackcloth; or to a bate any of thoſe <hi>accuſtomed ornaments,</hi> with which ſhe uſed (as a Queen) to entertain her ſelf in her proſperity.</p>
            <p>So that my learned friend concluded (in my opinion very rationally) that the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> inference <hi>(for which ſhe was juſtly eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-up by dogs)</hi> may no more be applied to this particular of <hi>Jezebels painting her eyes</hi> or <hi>face,</hi> than to her adorning, or <hi>dreſsing of her head;</hi> or her <hi>looking out of a window,</hi> or <hi>her ſpeaking ſuch words,</hi> as ſhe did to <hi>Jehu</hi>'s face: all which are recorded in the ſame ſtory, immediately before her <hi>precipitate ruine:</hi> which actions in themſelvs cannot be branded for ſins, nor are they noted there for ſuch, further than they may be relatively conſidered, as to the mind and end of the doer or ſpeaker, whereby to gratifie pride, paſſion, or any other wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And in this reſpective conſideration, not only <hi>Jezebels painting</hi> and dreſſing, but her very <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> her <hi>ſleeping</hi> and <hi>clothing,</hi> her native ſtrength and beauty, her civil honor and power might be <hi>relatively</hi> ſins; as the Scripture tells us, <hi>the plowing of the wicked is ſin,</hi> and <hi>his praying is abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> So his <hi>proſperity becomes a ſnare,</hi> and his <note place="margin">Prov. 21 4.

            <p>It is a groſſe miſtake in <hi>Architecture,</hi> to think that every ſmall ſtud bears the main ſtreſſe and burthen of the building, which lies (indeed) upon the <hi>principall timbers;</hi> And it is an horrible <hi>wreſting of Scripture,</hi> to make every recited circumſtance in any place, to bear the whole weight of the ſtory &amp; event.</p>

But I will not make any advantage <hi>of Gods ſilence</hi> in this particular, but rather an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with more certainty; That God in this place enumerates all thoſe particulars, not as <hi>abſolutely</hi> finding fault with, or forbidding the uſe of them, but as reproaching the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull pride and abuſe of them, in thoſe to whom he had indulged ſo many <hi>ſuperfluities:</hi> Therefore the Lord to prevent any miſtake, firſt gives the account of his diſpleaſure verſe 16. <hi>Becauſe the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with ſtretched forth necks, and wanton eyes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore, that is for their <hi>haughtineſſe and abuſing</hi> of Gods bounty in nature and art, he threatens to puniſh them by depriving them of thoſe things; as he doth otherwhere of <hi>his corn, wine, flax, and oyl;</hi> which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 5.</note> indulgence had afforded, not to pamper <hi>wanton and proud minds,</hi> to rebell againſt God, but to ſerve either naturall neceſſities,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114687:18"/>
or civil conveniencies, or ingenuous delights, or modeſt decencies, or honorable ſtate; as befitted mankind, in their ſociable, orderly and religious living, to their own <hi>content,</hi> to others <hi>benefit,</hi> and to the Creators <hi>glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God would not have threatned to deprive thoſe women of all thoſe things, if they had been evill or poyſons in themſelves; for then it had been a <hi>mercy</hi> to take them quite away; and a puniſhment to have continued them. Nor is the menace of <hi>ſtripping</hi> them of all thoſe ornaments, in order to ſcare them wholly from the uſe of them (which are other where, as I ſhewed you, allowed) but to teach them, how to prize and uſe them with more humility and modeſt piety; as things appointed to farre better uſes, than to ſerve ſenſuall, impudent, and impious either minds or ends; God aſſerts his right in all theſe (even ſo ſmall <hi>bagatellos,</hi> or <hi>toyes,</hi> comparatively) That we may learn to take heed, not to miſapply theſe, or any other the leaſt of Gods creatures to perverſe and ſiniſter ends; of which a ſober and good uſe may be made, to Gods glory, as well as our own delight and content; while we own him in all, and bleſſe him for all, even the <hi>leaſt help</hi> and <hi>ornament of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. It is an undoubted Maxime, both in Reaſon and Religion, That the <hi>Devils or</hi>

            <p>§. As to the <hi>wit of it,</hi> which makes all mending the <hi>complexion</hi> or lookes of <hi>our faces</hi> to be a kind of <hi>Self-adultery;</hi> A <hi>metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis</hi> of <hi>Gods work;</hi> A <hi>confuting of his diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſet upon his creatures; A <hi>rekindling</hi> the <hi>fire,</hi> which God hath <hi>quenched,</hi> and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing again into the <hi>ſtorme,</hi> whence one is happily <hi>eſcaped</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>§. My firſt Anſwer is: That it is hard to extract one drop of ſpirits, or <hi>quinteſſence</hi> of reaſon, and right <hi>argumentation</hi> (as to point of ſin, and ſtating the conſcience) from many <hi>handfuls,</hi> and heaps of <hi>Rhetorical flowers</hi> and parabolicall alluſions; which are but light skirmiſhings, and not ſerious contendings in matters of Religion; Such ſparks and <hi>flaſhes of Oratory</hi> (which are the main ſtock and ſtrength of <hi>moſt oppoſers</hi> in this caſe) are rather <hi>like</hi> the <hi>hedge-creeping</hi> light of <hi>gloe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes;</hi> than that celeſtiall vigor of divine Truth, whoſe beams have a ſtar-like <hi>ſublimity,</hi> and <hi>conſtancy</hi> of ſhining.</p>
            <p>As to the change and <hi>Alteration,</hi> which is odiouſly called a <hi>Self-adulterating;</hi> Tis true there is ſome little change of the complexion from a greater degree of <hi>pallor,</hi> to a leſſe, poſſibly to ſome little quickning of <hi>redneſſe;</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:114687:26"/>
yet not ſo, as to make any greater change on the face, or cheeks, than is frequently made by the bluſhings of thoſe, that are of moſt modeſt looks and tendereſt foreheads; This makes no more a new face or perſon, (ſo as to run any hazard of confuſion or miſtake) than uſually befalls women in their ſickneſſes, and ordinary diſtempers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident both to ſingle, and maried perſons; Who ſometimes appear pallidly ſad, as if they were going to their graves; other whiles with ſuch a roſy cheerfulneſſe, as if they had begun their reſurrection; ſo that this artificial change, is but a <hi>fixation</hi> of natures inconſtancy, both imitating its <hi>frequent eſſayes,</hi> and helping its variating <hi>infirmities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor doth all this ſo <hi>terrible</hi> a change a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to more than a little quickneſſe of colour upon the skin; It alters not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, faſhion, feature, proportions, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of nature; which is oft done, or at leaſt endeavoured, by ſeverall <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,</hi> both inward (as to <hi>phyſicall</hi> receipts, of all kinds:) Alſo outward by more groſs and <hi>mechanick arts,</hi> which ſtrive by many wayes to conceal, cover, and ſupply natures groſſer deformities, and defects, even as to the very <hi>ſubſtance of parts,</hi> no leſſe than to the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>borrowed ornaments.</hi> Thus the <hi>bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thinneſſe,</hi> and (as both men and women

            <p>§. Yet this <hi>Quantitative Adultery,</hi> which by ſuch patching and piecing of the body, makes far more groſſe alterations, &amp; ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall changes of nature, your <choice>

Truly <hi>(Madam)</hi> a ſmile, or ſilence were the beſt and juſteſt confutation of ſuch partiall allegations: which allow the greater, and yet ſcruple the leſſer changes.</p>
            <p>§.

            <p>The ſame <hi>Sarcaſme</hi> of <hi>Adulterating</hi> nature may be as juſtly uſed againſt all ſweet <hi>ſmells</hi> or <hi>ſents</hi> applyed to our hair, clothes bodies, or to our breath; Not onely as a <hi>delight,</hi> but as a <hi>remedy</hi> to the native rankneſſe or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſſe which ſome perſons are ſubject to both in their breath and conſtitutions; which not to cure, or alter by are is to condemn ſuch perſons (otherways not ill company) to ſolitudes, by reaſon of thoſe ill <hi>ſavours,</hi> which make them fitter for <hi>cells,</hi> than for <hi>ſociety.</hi> How impertinent and ungrate muſt that ſuperſtition be, which out of a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe nicety of offending the <hi>God</hi> of nature, (by altering any Characters or Impreſſions

he hath ſet on our bodies, in colour, favour or feature,) dreads to uſe, even thoſe helps and remedies, which both God and Nature have prepared, and liberally offered to our both <hi>civill</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> uſe of them; not more to our own <hi>pleaſure</hi> and innocent advantages, (beſides others <hi>ſociall content)</hi> than to the <hi>glory of God;</hi> So farre is the uſe of ſuch helps from any detriment or diminution to the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators glory,</hi> or work: Who oft ſuffers Nature in its ordinary road or tract, to <hi>erre,</hi> or <hi>fail</hi> of thoſe proportions which are moſt perfect and agreeable, purpoſely to incite and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thoſe gifts of <hi>art</hi> and <hi>ingenuity,</hi> which God hath ſuperadded, in <hi>reaſon</hi> to mankind, above all thoſe ſecond cauſes &amp; effects which are moved by more blind inſtincts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed impulſes: Nor is the wiſdome, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and <hi>goodneſſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> leſſe manifeſted at the <hi>ſecond hand,</hi> by humane <hi>operation</hi> upon, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of ſome works of Nature, than in the firſt productions of things; yea that rationall empire, liberty, diſpoſe &amp; uſe, wherewith God hath inveſted mankind, over all his works, in the inventions of art and manufacture, doth more magnify and ſet forth the munificence and indulgence of God, than that ſubſtance and ſubject matter, which he offereth to us, as to other creatures in all thoſe things, whoſe groſſeneſſe and confuſions are onely to

be poliſhed, diſtinguiſhed, improved and diſpoſed of by the art and induſtry peculiar of man: Wherein if children of the world and darkneſſe are ſo polite, ingenious and induſtrious, in order to obtain <hi>evill</hi> ends; how much more may the children of God, uſe their <hi>Fathers liberality</hi> in order to their own, and others honeſt <hi>complacencies</hi> and compleatings?</p>
            <p>Certainly, <hi>true piety</hi> permits us to pay an honor, love and reverence to our ſelves, as well as to others; and to our <hi>bodies,</hi> as well as to our <hi>Souls:</hi> Nor is the <hi>face</hi> more to be unconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or neglected, than other parts of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes; which we generally either protect from injury and contempt, or ſupply their wants, or help in their infirmity by what ever art and means, we can learn to be proper for their relief, without any fear or ſuſpicion of ſin.</p>
            <p>§. As to the jealouſy of <hi>baiting anew the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils hooks,</hi> or leading our ſelves and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to freſh temptations; when women ſeem to be in point of Beauty faded and almoſt out of date; As to the fear of rayſing up new ſtormes, when the amorous tempeſt of youth is well allayed; Truely theſe are as <hi>babies</hi> or children, rather <hi>pretty,</hi> than <hi>ſtrong objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and are then eaſily anſwered and fully confuted, when the heart meditating no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, yet ſtudies comelineſſe: The honeſteſt

beauty in its native <hi>ſimplicity</hi> may be as a baite; though it muſt not purpoſely <hi>ſet</hi> the <hi>devils traps</hi> or <hi>ſnares;</hi> Nay on the contrary, the uſe of ſome pretty <hi>artificiall reliefs</hi> to nature, may be a great means to keep as our ſelves from the temptations of envy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance, (which is always attended with diſcontent) ſo others too, whom theſe <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt frauds</hi> and pious guiles may hinder from thoſe by ways and extravagancies, to which more curious eyes and touchy tempers are prone to run, if they be not happily decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and ſo confined to ſober and holy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>So that I do not ſee, but that in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous uſe of <hi>colour</hi> and <hi>complexion</hi> to the face, there may be the <hi>wiſdome of the ſerpent,</hi> without the leaſt of its poyſon; Where the <hi>Dove-like innocency</hi> of the uſers mind preſerves not onely the <hi>native goodneſſe,</hi> which is from God in all things, that can be uſed, but alſo the <hi>civill</hi> and <hi>morall</hi> goodneſſe of their uſe, from all contagion of ſin, while the heart is kept within the confines of virtue and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility.</p>
            <p>Though ſome vain and wanton minds may turn this, as all things, to a <hi>ſerpent;</hi> yet others of modeſt tempers uſe it as a <hi>ſtaffe</hi> and <hi>ſtay</hi> both to their own minds and others, whom they moſt value: and to whom thay indevour

            </p>
            <p>§.
