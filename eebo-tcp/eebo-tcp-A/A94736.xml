         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is a certaine truth, that no events
happen without God, ſo it is moſt
certaine that all events are ordered
by Gods wiſedome to excellent
purpoſes. The utmoſt and meet end
of all Gods actions is himſelfe, that
as all things are of him, and through him, ſo all
things may bee to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36. The ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and nearer ends are many and various as
the Almighty ſees conducible to his glory which is
the utmoſt. And thus are wee to conceive that in
the ordering of the preſent commotions of this
Land the Lord hath ſundry ends, whereby he will
in fine ſhew himſelfe great in counſell, though as yet
we can hardly diſcerne whereto they tend. Among
<pb facs="tcp:155875:3"/>
many other ends he hath, theſe two ſeeme moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
the diſcovery of men, and the diſcovery of
himſelfe. For whereas on the one ſide the bloody
minded Papiſts, the proud ſenſuall Libertines, the
jugling deceitfull Prieſts and Prelats had gotten the
reputation of honeſt men, and on the other ſide the
ſincere, zealous and faithfull Chriſtian ſuffered all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities
under the imputations of hypocriſie, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,
faction and ſuch like calumnies; now by
theſe preſent tryalls the integrity, faithfulneſſe and
courage of the one, the hypocriſie, falſehood, and
wickedneſſe of the other are made manifeſt. And
whereas the frequency of prophane oathes, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticall
perjuries, the ſcorne of Religion, deriſion
of Piety, and contempt of holineſſe had worne out
the apprehenſions of God, and imboldned men to
play with him as a contemptible name, God hath
begun to diſcover himſelfe, and yet further will in
time appeare to be the great Lord of Hoaſts, and
the protector of his deſpiſed, and oppreſſed people.</p>
            <p>In reference to the later of theſe forenamed ends
God hath vouchſafed to diſcover many Plots, to
give many deliverances, to doe great things in theſe
few yeares laſt paſt for the vindicating of his owne
Name, the worth and innocency of his people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
declaration of the malignitie of ungodly ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Among which that which he did in preſerving of
<pb facs="tcp:155875:3"/>
this city in the late deliverance hereof is not the leaſt,
being in the apprehenſion of thoſe that know all the
circumſtances and the concurrence of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
therein, a very remarkable &amp; memorable thing.</p>
            <p>In the commemoration and acclamation thereof
it pleaſed God that by the appointment of one of you
I ſhould have a part, having by Gods providence bin
driven hither for ſhelter againſt the unreaſonable &amp;
impetuous violence of ſuperſtitious people enraged
by the inſtigations of bloody minded Papiſts, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Prieſts, and looſe Libertines. Since which time
I have been ſollicited to publiſh theſe ſubitany Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations:
though the matter deſerves a more full
diſcovery and an exacter commentary. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
that the remembrance hereof might not die,
and that ſome light might bee added to them that
ſeeke out Gods workes as having pleaſure therein,
I have yeelded to their requeſt. And foraſmuch as

            <head>A ſhort Narration of the late bloody and
abominable conſpiracy againſt the City of
<hi>Briſtoll,</hi> as appeareth by the examination of the
Parties thereunto. 1642.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Malignant and treacherous Party within this
City, having long endeavoured to bring in the
forces of the enemy into this City, they hoped
that they had gotten an opportunity to effect
their deſigne on Tueſday night laſt being the ſeventh of
<hi>March,</hi> when by their invitation Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> having
drawne a great party of Horſe and Dragoones with ſome foote
to <hi>Durdum</hi> Downe, within two miles of this Citie, the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
before that night, theſe treacherous and bloody perſons
within the towne had framed a party to fall upon the backes of
the Guards, and to ſurprize them and cut them off, and to let
in the enemy, who upon the ringing of two Bells, viz <hi>S. Iohns</hi>
and <hi>S. Michaels,</hi> were to give on upon the Towne without,
as the conſpirators were to fall upon the guards within. The
ringing of theſe two Bells being a common ſigne unto them
both within and without the towne. For the better effecting
of this trayterous and wicked conſpiracy, the chiefe heads
thereof had that night aſſembled together in their houſes
thoſe of their confederacy, with divers Saylers and Halliers
with all ſorts of Armes, Muskets, Piſtolls, Swords, Clubs, and
Barrells of old Nayles to charge the Ordnance withall after
<pb facs="tcp:155875:4"/>
they had furpriſed them. And theſe ſeverall companies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their ſeverall Leaders were to have fallen upon the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Courts of guards; Maſter <hi>Robert Yeomans</hi> (who is
the head of this conſpiracy and pretendeth a Commiſsion from
his Majeſty for what he hath done) being to fall upon the
maine Guard, and Maſter <hi>George Butcher</hi> with
his company was to have fallen upon the Guard at
<hi>Froome</hi> Gate, and to have opened it for the enemy to
enter by: others no doubt had their parts to play, and
the better to diſtinguiſh themſelves from thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated
to deſtruction, thoſe that were of their party had a
word which was (<hi>Charles</hi>) and certaine markes of white
Tape tied upon their breaſts before, and their hats behind, and
ſuch as were to be ſpared within doores had certaine markes
ſet upon the inſide of their doores; for the reſt (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the ſpeeches of an Officer amongſt the enemies Forces)
one of them was heard to ſay that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to give no Quarter, but to kill man, woman and
child that had not thoſe markes upon their perſons and houſes.
And that at the ſame time that they were to fall into the
towne, the Saylers were to ſet the towne on fire in ſeverall
parts; (which is conceived ſhould have been Captaine <hi>Boones</hi>
part) but God of his mercy delivered us from this dangerous
and devilliſh conſpiracy, by ſome notice that we had given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us of their meeting at <hi>Yeomans</hi> his houſe, about an houre
or two before the plot was to have beene put in exeeution,
which was to have been upon the ringing of the Bells about
one or two a clocke in the morning. Having ſeized on Maſter
<hi>Robert Yeomans</hi> with his company, and after, <hi>Butcher</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:155875:5"/>
with his company, the necke of the plot being broken within the
Towne, the enemy without (whoſe deſigne as it ſhould ſeeme
depended much upon it) having ſhowne themſelves upon the
Downe the next morning after two or three ſhot of Canons
made againſt them from our worke upon <hi>Brandon</hi> hill, they
wheeled off, and ſo God put a Hook into their noſtrills, and
turned them back againe: for which great mercy of his in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
us from a dangerous invaſion of the enemy without,
and from a damnable conſpiracy of ſome traytorous inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
within the City; both this towne and the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
(ſo far as it is concerned in the preſervation of this City)
hath great cauſe to give thanks to Almighty God, unto whom
alone the glory thereof is due.</p>
            <p>This is a ſhort narration of the late deteſtable and bloody
Plot againſt this City, whereof no doubt more hereafter will
appeare, the matter being yet under examination, onely one
writing which was found in <hi>Robert Yeomans</hi> his houſe, I
thought fit to adde, which was as followeth.</p>
            <p>All Inhabitants of the Bridge, the High-ſtreet and Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreete,
keepe within your doores upon perill of your lives: All
other inhabitants of this Citie that ſtand for the King, the
Proteſtant Religion and the Liberties of this City, let them
forthwith appeare at the High Croſſe with ſuch armes as they
have for the defence of their lives, their wives and children,
and follow their Leaders for the ſame defence.</p>
            <p>There was alſo a Proteſtation taken amongſt them to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that they would oppoſe to the utmoſt of their power, all
Forces whatſoever that were, or ſhould be amongſt them, or

of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Verſ. 5. 3 His overthrow of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, and
delivering juſt Lot,</hi> Verſ. 6, 7. From theſe inſtances he inferres by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
two rules to be obſerved in the courſe of Gods proceedings.

<hi>That he knoweth how to reſerve the unjuſt to the day of judgement to be puniſhed.</hi>
The particle [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for if] Verſ. 4. ſhewes theſe inſtances to be brought
as a <hi>medium</hi> to prove a concluſion, and the argument is thus. If God
even then when he caſt the Angels that ſinned downe to hell, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the guiltleſſe Angels, and even then when he brought the deluge
on the wicked world, ſaved <hi>Noah</hi> a Preacher of righteouſneſſe, and even
then when he overthrew <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> delivered juſt <hi>Lot, &amp;
ſic in caeteris,</hi> then it followes as in my Text, <hi>The Lord knoweth how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Godly out of Temptation, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former of theſe two Conſectaries I have choſen this day to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
on, being a day ſet apart for the commemoration of a late delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155875:6"/>
of this City from a blood, and abominable conſpiracy within
it, wherein God hath added one more memorable Inſtance to verifie
this rule of Saint <hi>Peter, The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of
Temptation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two concluſions may from hence be gathered. Firſt, <hi>That the godly
while they live among unjuſt men upon the earth be in Temptation.</hi> Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from Temptation preſuppoſeth a being in Temptation. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>That God knowes how to deliver them though they know not; Noah</hi> and
<hi>Lot</hi> knew not how they ſhould be delivered, but <hi>God knew how to do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To confirme the former of theſe we need not many Scriptures, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
proved by continuall experience, yet I ſhall produce ſome, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.
28. <hi>Our Lord Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe, Yee are they which have continued with
me in my Temptations.</hi> Our Lord Chriſt when he lived on earth, was in
continuall Temptations, and what was Chriſts eſtate is the eſtate of all
Chriſtians comformably; Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelfe, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 19. ſaith, <hi>That
he ſerved the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many teares and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
which befell him by the lying in waite of the Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 37.
among other things that befell the Saints it is ſaid <hi>They were tempted.</hi>
Temptation then is one of thoſe things that are the lot of the godly.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour to open this truth, by inquiring; firſt, who are
to be accounted godly; ſecondly, what temptation they are under;
thirdly, why it is ſo with them? In anſwer to the firſt we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that the word we tranſlate <hi>godly</hi> in Grecke <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is as much as
in Engliſh <hi>right worſhippers.</hi> So they that be right worſhippers are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſons; the Etymology fitly expreſſeth the thing: Now by worſhip
is meant the honour and ſervice that is done unto a God. For god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
implies religious ſervice, and all that religious ſervice we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to any thing under the notion of a God, that is worſhip: And
it is <hi>Mediate,</hi> or <hi>Immediate;</hi> mediate ſervice is that which is directed to
man, yet by reaſon of reſpect unto God. For this is a cleare truth,
that even all the duties of righteouſneſſe we performe to men, if they be
done in obedience to God, they are part of his ſervice and worſhip,
not in reſpect of the matter wherein, but in reſpect of the motive by
which they are performed. Thus when a ſervant doth diſcharge his
duty faithfully to his Maſter as <hi>Doing the will of God from the heart,</hi> hee
is ſaid to doe ſervice to the Lord, <hi>Epheſ. 6. 5, 6, 7. Coloſ.</hi> 3. 24. Every ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
that obeyes his maſter, every child that honours his father, every
ſouldier that obeyes his Commander out of conſcience to God, not
for wages, portion, applauſe or the like reſpects onely, therein hee
worſhips God. Immediate worſhip is that which is directed onely
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155875:6"/>
to God. And this hath by uſe engroſſed the name of <hi>Worſhip.</hi> Now
when this is not right worſhip, though men bee never ſo devout in it,
yet they are not godly perſons: when the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> called on the
name of <hi>Baal</hi> from morning even till noone, ſaying, <hi>O Baal heare us,
though they cryed aloud and cut themſelves after their manner with Knives and
Lances till the blood guſhed out upon them, 1 Kings</hi> 18. 26. 28. yet there was
no godlineſſe in all this. In like manner though the Papiſts and other
ſuperſtitious perſons are very devout in their way, ſpend much time
in prayer after their manner, faſt often, and doe many laborious works
for ſatisfaction of their ſinnes, yet becauſe they worſhip not God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
they are not godly perſons. If it be then asked who are they that
are <hi>Right worſhippers?</hi> I anſwer. To right worſhipping theſe things
are requiſite.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they that are right worſhippers worſhip onely the true God;
whoſoever he be that gives religious worſhip of any ſort to any other
beſides the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whether it be inward worſhip of the ſoule, as
truſting in it, loving it, fearing it, magnifying and extolling of it in
their hearts, or outward worſhip, as by geſture of the body, kneeling,
falling downe before it, bowing, lifting up the hands or eyes, kiſſing,
or by offering of gifts, bringing oblation, incenſe, ſacrifice, firſt fruits,
tithes, or by ſwearing by them, praying to them, making vowes to
them, bleſſing them, ſinging Hymnes in their praiſe, conſecrating
Temples, making Prieſts, keeping holy dayes to them, (for all theſe are
religious worſhip) whoſoever I ſay gives any or more of theſe or any
other ſort of <hi>Religious worſhip</hi> not mentioned to any beſides the true
God, is an <hi>Idolater,</hi> and therefore not a right worſhipper; for this is the
true definition of an <hi>Idolater: Whoſoever gives Divine worſhip to a Creature
is an Idolater:</hi> as may be gathered from the Apoſtles deſcription of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 25. where it is charged upon them <hi>that they changed the truth
of God,</hi> that is, the inviſible Power and Majeſty of God, which they
knew by the things that are made, Verſ. 18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>into a lie,</hi> that
is, into a lying reſemblance, <hi>and worſhipped and ſerved the Creature,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>more then the Creator,</hi> ſo our laſt Tranſlation hath it, but
the better and true reading is, <hi>Beſides the Creator.</hi> For it is plaine by
the words, Verſ. 23. <hi>That they changed the glory of the incorruptible God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an Image made like to corruptible man,</hi> and Verſ. 25. <hi>that they changed the
truth of God into a lie,</hi> and therefore they worſhipped the Creature more
then the Creator: But this was their Idolatry that they worſhipped
the Creator by a lying reſemblance, and ſo worſhipped the creature
beſides the Creator. So then this is the firſt note of a right worſhipper,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155875:7"/>
that hee worſhips with Religious worſhip none but <hi>Jehovah</hi> the true
God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they that are right worſhippers as they worſhip onely the
true God, ſo they direct this worſhip only by the true Mediatour, which
is Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God. He onely is a right worſhipper, that
worſhips God in Chriſt, whoſoever he be that makes any other media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
unto God, let him be called mediator of redemption or of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
it is againſt the true worſhipping of God, and an high violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the glory of Jeſus Chriſt. For as the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5.
<hi>There is one God and one Mediator betweene God and man, even the man
Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> no more Mediators are acknowledged by the Apoſtle,
then there be Gods. <hi>To us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all
things, and we in him, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and
we in him, 1 Cor.</hi> 8. 6. Therefore the true worſhippers are deſcribed to
be ſuch as <hi>rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, Phil.</hi> 3. 3. that glory in him as their
Lord and Mediator.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they that are right worſhippers, worſhip the true God by
the true Mediator according to the true rule, that is, they worſhip the
true God according to his owne preſcription, and appointment, not
according to mens devices and inventions. For as our Saviour tells
us, <hi>Matth. 15. 9. In vaine doe they worſhip God, who teach for Doctrines the
Commandements of men.</hi> Hee that ſhall goe as far as <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to viſit
Chriſts Sepulchre, that ſhall ſprinkle himſelfe with holy water, keepe
reliques of Saints, obſerve old cuſtomes of former Chriſtians, abſtaine
from eating fleſh, if he could keepe all the traditions of men, not faile
in any point of ceremony, and thereby thinke to pleaſe God as if hee
did him honour, thereby ſhall not onely miſſe of his end, but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead
thereof provoke the wrath of God againſt himſelfe through his
ſuperſtition. Let all ſuperſtitious perſons who are very devout in their
way, know this for a certaine truth, that God doth not eſteeme them
as godly perſons, becauſe they are not right worſhippers of God. The
godly <hi>have the Law of God in their heart, Pſal.</hi> 37. 31. and according to
it, endeavour to walke in all duties of his worſhip.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, right worſhippers worſhip God for a right end, that they
may honour him and exalt him in their ſoules, and give him glory.
The Phariſees <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 5. prayed to God, gave Almes, and no doubt alſo
brought their ſacrifices to Gods Altar, yet nevertheleſſe they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
Hypocrites, becauſe they did theſe things that they might bee
ſeene of men. And the ſame cenſure belongs to all others that ſhall pray,
preach, heare, or performe any other duty of Gods worſhip that they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155875:7"/>
may gaine a name of Religious perſons, and not chiefely for the glory
of God that his name may be ſanctified, whoſoever miſſeth the right
end of worſhip, loſeth the title of a Godly man.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Right worſhippers worſhip God from a right principle.
Two principles of our worſhip are neceſſary that our worſhip be right.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Spirit of God; no man can worſhip the Lord in truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the Spirit of God dwell and act in him, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 3. No man can ſay
that Jeſus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Secondly, a right faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which a man cannot worſhip truely, for the doctrine of our Lord
Jeſus is the doctrine which is according to godlineſſe, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 3. The
myſtery of Godlineſſe, 1 Tim. 3. 16. the faith of Gods elect, the acknowledging of
the truth, which is after godlineſſe, Tit.</hi> 1. 1. whence I inferre that to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is requiſite an acknowledgement of the truth, and that onely the
true faith is that which begets godlineſſe. Wherefore all Hereticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that hold falſehoods againſt the fundamentall truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
cannot be right worſhippers; a corrupt faith doth beget a corrupt
worſhip.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, right worſhippers muſt worſhip God with right affection.
They that worſhip God truely muſt worſhip God in ſpirit and truth,
<hi>Joh. 4. 23, 24. We are the Circumciſion which worſhip God in the ſpirit, Phil.</hi> 3. 3.
that is, that worſhip God, not onely with the outward man, but alſo
in the inward man, with knowledge, love, zeale, reverence, obedience,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, theſe godly perſons you heare are under Temptations.
Temptation is as much as Tryall. By Temptations are meant ſinfull
and evill practiſes, and that both as ſinfull and harmefull. For the
concluſion being drawne from the inſtances before, Verſ. 5, 6, 7. it is to
be conceived that the Temptation that God knoweth how to deliver
from, is the ſame with which <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were exerciſed. Now <hi>Lot</hi>
was exerciſed with the evill practiſes of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> as they were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<hi>That righteous man dwelling amongſt them, in ſeeing &amp; hearing vexed his
righteous ſoule from day to day with their unlawfull deeds,</hi> Verſ. 8. In like
manner <hi>Noah</hi> was tried by the corrupt doings of the old world. The
ſinfull and impure actions of evill men are Temptations to the godly
that live among them. Likewiſe <hi>Lot</hi> was exerciſed with their evill
practiſes as they were harmefull. So you may reade <hi>Gen. 19. 4. 9. That
the Sodomites compaſſed Lots houſe, and would have broken in upon him, and
violated the Strangers that came into his houſe.</hi> And accordingly, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from Temptation, is not onely to deliver from the infection of ſin,
but alſo to deliver from miſchievous maſſacres, violations, breaking
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155875:8"/>
open of houſes, ſpoyling, perſecution, combinations, reproaches, taunts
and all other injurious uſages godly men are in danger to meete with.
Now theſe are called temptations. Firſt, partly becauſe they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
to ſin, for a man that lives among wicked men is not onely
by example provoked to imitate them, but alſo by continuall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant
moleſtations, driven to doe as they doe, for their owne eaſe,
quiet, and ſecurity, and drawne by their flatteries, and wiles to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with them, and thereby tempted. Secondly, partly becauſe they
are exerciſes of patience, and conſtancy whereby the ſtrength and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe
of Beleevers is tryed.</p>
            <p>Now for the reaſons hereof. Firſt, the firſt is from the innate hatred
and malice that is in the heart of all unrighteous men towards the
godly. There is a venomous malignity in the heart of wicked men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the godly, be they as neere to them as the wife in the boſome, or
the childe that is the fruite of their loynes: though it may be ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a while in the heart, yet it lurkes in the heart, and will flame forth
when that which covers it is removed, and ſome occaſion bring it forth
into act. Thus our Saviour informes his Diſciples, <hi>Joh. 15. 19. If yee
were of the world the world would love his owne: but becauſe ye are not of the
world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth y<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u.</hi>
And after him Saint <hi>John 1. Epiſt.</hi> 3. 13. Marvell not my Brethren if the
world hate you.</p>
            <p>Even as there is a naturall Antipathy between ſome beaſts, as a Wolfe
will worry and devoure a Lambe, though it lye downe quietly by it, ſo
there is a ſecret Antipathy betweene an ungodly and a godly perſon,
though never ſo willing to live in peace. Hence it is a ſport to them to
doe miſchiefe, a contentfull thing to vex them. If they heare evill of
them, they will beleeve and divulge it; if they have aſcoffe to flout them
with, they will vent it; if they have a deſire to harme them, they will
practiſe it. And that they hate them becauſe they are godly, appeares
by the falſhood of their pretences for their hatred. They pretend they
hate them for cenſuring them, ſometimes for faction, turbulency, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſometimes for hypocriſie and ſuch like pretences. And yet who
more cenſorious, factious, turbulent, ſeditious, falſ-hearted than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
or whom doe they favour more than ſuch perſons? doubtleſſe
if the godly were ſuch, they would love them as being like themſelves.
Search the matter to the bottome, and it will appeare that theſe are but
colours to cloke their hatred with from the eyes of men. It appeares by
the univerſality of their hatred to godly perſons. If their hatred were
particular to ſome, it might be ſurmiſed it came from ſome particular
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155875:8"/>
cauſe of difference. But experience ſhewes it to be generall, their ſpirits
are imbittered againſt thoſe that they never had any dealing with, their
hearts riſe againſt thoſe they never ſaw, if they heare or conceive them
to be Preciſians, Puritans, Round-heads, or if there be any other Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
by which they denominate godly perſons. Though the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
were delightfull to them before, though they were eſteemed &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by them, yet when once they begin to be godly they loath them, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
them, abuſe them. It appeares further, in that they hate them not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
neare relations, by reaſon of which nature teacheth them
to love them. An unrighteous father or mother will not brooke a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
child, an Idolatrous, husband will not agree with an holy wife:
they that agree not in the true worſhip of the ſame God, cannot agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves. Beſides this hatred is implacable, without mercy: there
muſt be no favour ſhewed to a Puritan, when a Papiſt, a Drunkard, a
Thiefe, a wandring rogue ſhall finde favour, come off eaſily in any try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
be remitted any wrong; but no plea, no interceſſion, no deprecation
ſhall prevaile to ſave a godly perſon from the extremity of oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ungodly men are of unquiet ſpirits, they are like Satan that
never reſts, <hi>Matth. 12. 43. The wicked,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſay 57. 20. are
like the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt.</hi>
They are ſtill ſurmiſing ſome evill, or inventing ſome evill, or ſpeaking
ſome evill of them, or acting ſome evill againſt them. It is wages enough
for them to doe hurt to godly men, though they hazard life, eſtate, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and their ſoules too, yet they are furiouſly carried to doe them
miſchiefe, <hi>Come ſay they, Jer. 18. 18. let us deviſe deviſes againſt Jeremiah;
come let us ſmite him with the tongue. They deviſe miſchiefe on their Beds; they
ſet themſelves in a way that is not good: they ab<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erre not evill, Pſal. 36. 4. They
ſleepe not except they have done miſchiefe, and their ſleepe is taken away unleſſe
they cauſe ſome to fall, Prov.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they be injurious. <hi>The beſt of them,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>is a
Briar; the moſt upright is ſharper then a thorne hedge, Micah</hi> 7. 4. Take the
beſt, that is, the moſt civill, ingenuous, regular, of unregenerate men, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
people, carnall worldlings, lukewarme formaliſts, they
cannot brooke a zealous religious perſon, if they cannot wound deadly
they will ſcratch and teare their fleſh, if they cannot bite, they will barke
and ſnarle at them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they are proud, high conceited of themſelves: But the godly
are of no account in their eyes; they conceive themſelves Gyants, godly
men as <hi>Pygmees;</hi> now pride begets diſdaine, and inſolent behaviour.
<hi>When pride compaſſeth them about as a chaine, violence covereth them as a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155875:9"/>
Garment, Pſal.</hi> 73. 6. when pride is in the heart there will bee ſpurning
and trampling upon with feet.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ungodly men are acted by Satan, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 22. <hi>He is the ſpirit
that worketh in the children of diſobedience.</hi> And they that are ruled by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
muſt needs doe what hurt they can to godly perſons. When the
Devill entred into <hi>Judas</hi> his heart he could not ſtay but goes out pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
about his worke of betraying his maſter, <hi>John</hi> 13. 27. no ſooner
have they a Commiſſion from Satan, but they are preſently ready to
execute it. And therefore it cannot bee but that while the godly live
among the unjuſt they ſhould be under temptations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Applic.</hi> For application of this Truth, we may be informed in the
reaſon of the preſent miſchievous carriage of unjuſt men towards the
godly, why they now tempt them, not onely by perſwaſions to ſinne
with them, but alſo by ſcorning, contemning and injurious dealing,
yea and (as the preſent experience proves it true) by miſchievous Plots
to deſtroy them, and to root them out of the Land of the living: The
late example of their practiſes, which occaſioned this dayes ſolemnity
is a moſt remarkable Inſtance of the malignity of ſpirit that is in the
hearts of wicked men againſt godly perſons. What the plot was you
have heard from the relation read to you. I hope you thereby ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
apprehend the certainty and manner of it from their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions,
the miſchievouſneſſe of it, how great it would have beene, if it
had taken effect: and by ſomething in the relation, as the ſecuring of
ſome perſons and houſes by privy markes, who were like themſelves,
and the deſtinating of others to a <hi>panolethrie,</hi> it appeares that it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with a hatred and enmity againſt godly perſons, whom they have
branded with the name of Round-heads.</p>
            <p>I deny not but it hath beene alleadged, that the reaſon of this
plot was loyalty to the King, that they might expell out of the Citie,
thoſe that rebell againſt him, and admit his forces into it: concerning
this matter it is needfull ſomething be ſpoken. The conſtant Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
of the Commanders and Souldiers here is, <hi>That they will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to the utmoſt of their power with their life and fortunes the Kings maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
royall perſon, honour and eſtate.</hi> If any ſhall keepe this Citie againſt
the King, undoubtedly that perſon ſhould be made an example by ſome
heavy end. I hope none here have any ſuch thoughts or purpoſes; but
that their ends are right to protect it for the King, and not againſt the
King. But it will be ſaid, How can that be, ſith it is againſt his will?
his command is to the contrary? Concerning this, thus much is ſaid,
that even by the judgement of thoſe perſons againſt whom lies no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:155875:9"/>
it hath been granted, that ſometimes it may not bee rebellion
to reſiſt the perſonall will and command of the King. I will alleadge
three inſtances. The firſt out of a Booke intituled <hi>The true difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Chriſtian ſubjection and Antichriſtian Rebellion,</hi> compoſed by <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Bilſon</hi> afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and in great power at Court
in King <hi>James</hi> his dayes, dedicated to Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and for ought
can be gathered by the frequent Printing of it, and the preferment of
the Author adjudged Orthodox. In it there are theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If a Prince ſhould goe about to ſubject his kingdome to a forraine
realme, or change the forme of the Commonwealth from imperie
to Tyranny or neglect the Lawes eſtabliſhed by common conſent
of Prince and people to execute his owne pleaſure: in theſe, and other
caſes which might be named, if the Nobles and Commons joyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to defend their ancient, and accuſtomed liberty, Regiment
and Lawes, they may not well be accounted Rebels. And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
As I ſaid then, ſo I ſay now, the law of God giveth no man leave
to reſiſt his Prince: but I never ſaid that Kingdomes and Common-wealths
might not proportion their ſtates as they thought beſt by
their publike Lawes, which afterward the Princes themſelves may
not violate. By ſuperiour Powers ordained of God wee underſtand
not onely Princes, but all politicke ſtates and regiments, ſomewhere
the people, ſomewhere the Nobles having the ſame intereſt to the
Sword that Princes have in their kingdomes. And in kingdomes
where Princes beare rule by the Sword, we doe not meane the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
private will againſt his Lawes: but his Precept derived from his
Lawes, and agreeing with his Lawes: which though it be wicked,
yet may it not be reſiſted of any ſubject with armed violence. Marry
when Princes offer their ſubjects not juſtice; but force: and deſpiſe
all lawes to practiſe their luſts; not every, nor any private man may
take the ſword to redreſſe the Prince: but if the Lawes of the Land
appoint the Nobles as next to the King to aſſiſt him in doing right,
and with-hold him from doing wrong, then bee they licenſed by
mans Law, and ſo not prohibited by Gods to interpoſe themſelves
for the ſafeguard of equity and innocency and by all lawfull and
needfull meanes to procure the Prince to be reformed: But in no caſe
deprived where the Scepter is inherited.</q>

            <p>The ſecond inſtance is in King <hi>James,</hi> who in his anſwer to Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Peron</hi> his Oration to the three eſtates of <hi>France,</hi> ſpeakes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
in <hi>France,</hi> who had ſundry times in the dayes of <hi>Francis</hi> the

up Armes againſt the oppreſſion of the <hi>Guiſian</hi> faction at Court main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by thoſe Kings, as of the Kings beſt ſubjects, and that their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
warres was not taking up armes againſt their King, it was but ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on their Guard; which the event proved to be true.</p>
            <p>The third inſtance is the Act of Parliament confirming the Treaty
with the <hi>Scots</hi> Commiſſioners paſſed by our preſent King this very Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
in which it was enacted, That the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenanters who had
ſeized on <hi>Edenborough</hi> Caſtle, raiſed an Army in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the
Kings will, and entred <hi>England</hi> therewith, were nevertheleſſe on <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>
7. 1641. to bee declared in all Churches of this kingdome of
<hi>England</hi> no <hi>Rebells:</hi> from which alſo they were acquitted by our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
King in their Parliament of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But it will bee ſaid, that
though things are carried never ſo violently or unjuſtly, yet Chriſtians
are taught to ſuffer, not to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, wee may not reſiſt Authority; but ſuffer under it,
though proceeding unjuſtly. We are forbidden to reſiſt not only the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame,
but alſo the meaneſt perſon in authority proceeding according
to authority, that is, in a way of law judicially, though the proceedings
be unjuſt, yet while the proceedings are according to authority, there is
no reſiſtance allowed but by ſuffering. But if ſo be that the proceeding be
by meere violence, ſpoyling men of their goods, deſtroying, reſtrayning
their perſons without any legall charge, ſurely Gods Law hath not
debarred men of the uſe of the Law of nature, which directs a man to
defend though not to revenge himſelfe againſt violence; ſuppoſe a
Prince ſhould take with him a company of robbers and cut-throates,
and ſet upon a Subject by the high way, I would have it conſidered
whether a Traveller might not defend his perſon and goods: and in
like manner may it be ſaid concerning breaking into a mans houſe.
Though <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him when he cut off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet we reade not that he repented his gathering a band of men
to him, his getting into ſtrong holds for defence of himſelfe againſt
<hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there were now any that had a hand in this wicked Plot here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
I would ſpeake to them by way of Expoſtulation. What have the
godly done, or what do they that there ſhould bee ſuch devices againſt
them? If it be ſaid they are factious, and diſturbe the land by their
faction; I would further know what is their faction? Doe they make a
ſide or party to engroſſe wealth, honour or ſecular power to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
They ſtrive much you will ſay to prevaile; True, they ſtrive, but
for whom? for themſelves, or for God? What is it they are earneſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:155875:10"/>
for? Is it not for a neceſſary reformation? Is it not that the holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of Chriſt may bee kept from prophanation by the promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
admittance of all forts of open ungodly perſons, drunkards, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
&amp;c. unto them? Is it not that thoſe inventions of men which are
by many thought parts of Gods worſhip, without which Gods ſervice
is not well performed, and conſequently ſuperſtitious in their uſe, may
be removed? Is it not that Gods worſhip may be reduced from a meere
empty formality by ſaying prayers, &amp; reading out of a Book, to a lively
&amp; fruitful performing therof? Is it not that in ſtead of a ſwarm of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Miniſters, that have not knowledge or skill to teach the principles
of Chriſtian Religion, of licentious, and lewd Miniſters that by their
evill life are a ſhame to our Religion, of meere worldlings, of proud
ambitious Miniſters that ſeeke their owne things, and not the things of
Jeſus Chriſt, of corrupt Miniſters that are corrupt in their opinions,
as in the doctrine of Grace, Chriſts preſence in the Euchariſt, &amp;c. there
may be placed over the Church of Chriſt godly, able, painefull, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Miniſters that may guide the people of God into the way of
peace? It it not that in ſtead of that kinde of diſcipline which all the
world knowes hath beene uſed onely to draw mony out of mens pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to oppreſſe godly perſons, and holy exerciſes tending to promote
knowledge and pietie under pretence of conventicles, to domineere and
Lord it over Gods heritage, there might be a right way of diſcipline ſet
up, tending to the right ordering and furthering of Gods worſhip? Is
it not that in ſtead of the increaſe of Popery and the Maſſe (which are
likely in time unleſſe prevented to overgrow true Religion) preaching
of Chriſt may be promoted? If this be their faction, ſo farre as I can
conceive it is a faction for God, and they that ayme at their oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for this cauſe, aime at the oppreſſion of godlineſſe and godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee may hence learne that they doe ill provide for their
peace, that doe favour ſuch unrighteous perſons. If yee aske who doe
ſo? I anſwer; firſt, they that chooſe to dwell neare them for worldly
advantages: This was <hi>Lots</hi> ſinne and folly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 10, 11, 12, 13. who
choſe his habitation in <hi>Sodom,</hi> becauſe it had a pleaſant and fruitfull
ſituatuation, though the inhabitants were exceeding wicked before the
Lord. Yee know how ill he ſped by going to <hi>Sodom,</hi> thinking to get
more wealth he loſt all. Secondly, thoſe that make marriages, leagues
and bonds of amitie with them. Uſually ſuch perſons finde their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
to be their miſery, their friendſhip to be their ſnare. They that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:155875:11"/>
were mingled among the heathen learned their workes, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a ſnare to them, <hi>Pſal. 106. 35, 36. Jehoſaphat</hi> his joyning in affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe occaſioned the breaking of his ſhips, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of his family, and the deſtruction of many of his poſterity. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thoſe that connive, bolſter up, plead for ſuch men, it is uſuall with
God to make them a vexation in the concluſion to thoſe that have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
and pleaded for them. Fourthly, thoſe that commit power to
them by chooſing them to be Magiſtrates and officers of truſt; They that
put into imployment malignant ſpirits againſt the godly, muſt look to
have a temptation and a ſnare by them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it ſhould warne us to take heed of unneceſſary ſocietie, with
unjuſt and ungodly men: we are commanded <hi>not to be unequally yoaked
with unbelevers, 2 Corinth.</hi> 6. 14. there muſt bee a ſeparation from them,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 17. I cannot now examine the ſeverall ſorts and caſes of ſeparation
both civill and eccleſiaſticall. This in the generall may be ſaid, he that
heeds not to avoyd ſocietie with ungodly men which is not needfull,
doth certainly caſt himſelfe into temptation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it ſhould warne us how we deale with ſuch kind of men
when we are neceſſitated to have any thing to doe with them. It was
the ſaying of <hi>David</hi> in his <hi>Cygnea cantio,</hi> his laſt words, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 6. 7.
<hi>But the ſonnes of Belial ſhall be all of them as thor<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es thruſt away, becauſe they
cannot be taken with hands. But the man that ſhall touch them muſt be fenced
with iron, and the ſtaffe of a ſpeare.</hi> He that muſt have to doe with wicked
men had need be fenced with iron. If you aske how? I anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. Be armed as <hi>Lot</hi> was, with the ſpirit of mourning, ye muſt mourne
for their ſinnes as <hi>Lot</hi> did here, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 8. That righteous man dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them in hearing and ſeeing vexed his righteous ſoule from day to day with
their unlawfull deeds.</hi> If yee muſt be in their company, yet yee muſt not
delight in their company: if yee doe, it is a ſigne yee are of the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
with them. There is ſometimes a neceſſitie of their company
by reaſon of naturall relation, neighbourhood, trading; but there is a
greater neceſſity that we mourne for their ſwearing, ſcoffing, lying, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
ſpeeches which we cannot remedy.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Take heed of truſting them or hearkning to them, make them not
of thy privie counſell, unleſſe thou wouldſt be betrayed by them. It is
the Prophet</hi> Micah <hi>his uſe,</hi> Mic. 7. 4, 5. Becauſe the beſt of them is a Briar,
truſt not in a friend, put yee not confidence in a guide, keepe the doores of thy
mouth from her that lieth in thy boſome. <hi>And the Prophet</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>Chap.</hi>
9. 4. Take yee heed every one of his neighbour, and truſt yee not in any Brother;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:155875:11"/>
for every Brother will utterly ſupplant, and every neighbour will walke with
ſlanders.</p>
            <p>3. Thou muſt be wiſe in ſpeaking to them, <hi>Pſal. 39. 1. I will keepe my
mouth with a bridle,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, while the wicked is before me,</hi> when wee
are in the company of evill men we have need looke to the motions of
our tongues.</p>
            <p>4. Get patience, and meekeneſſe in bearing their injuries and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
In ſuch company thou ſhalt meete with Temptations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhouldſt be fitted to encounter with them.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Be wiſe how thou doe reprove them: though reproofe bee a
duty, yet it muſt bee well managed; our Saviours direction is,</hi>
Matthew 7. 6. Give not holy things unto the Dogs, neither caſt pearles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Swine leſt they trample them under their feet, and turne againe and
rend you.</p>
            <p>6. Endeavour by all good meanes to convert them. Take heed of
complying with them in their wayes, under pretence of turning them.
That's the ready way for them to glory and inſult over thee and
to harden themſelves. But bee thou as a light ſhining before them
to convince them, <hi>Philippians</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p>7. If wee cannot convert them, yet let us endeavour to reſtraine
them by our authority, prayers and power with them.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, It ſhould admoniſh us to prepare our ſelves for theſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
while yee live on earth yee ſhall not live in a heaven of Saints,
but in a world of ungodly men, and therefore make account of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and fit your ſelves for them; yee that be here of this Citie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God hath given you deliverance now, doe not grow ſecure, but
thinke ye may have more trialls. Remember the ſpirit of wicked men
is reſtleſſe, though they miſſe in one plot they will attempt another;
according to the ſpirit by which they are guided, as Satan goes
about ſeeking whom hee may devoure, ſo doe wicked men his
Agents.</p>
            <p>Sixtly and laſtly, Herein is manifeſted the gratious providence of
God for the godly, that though they are under Temptations, yet they
are delivered from them, though they walke among ſnares, though
they are placed as Chriſt ſaith as <hi>ſheepe in the midſt of wolves,</hi> a few weake
ſheepe in the middeſt of a great multitude of ravening wolves, yet
the Church is preſerved, this is Gods work; ſo it was at this time in this
City, a ſmall company of godly perſons preſerved from a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of malignant ſpirits within and without it: O let us admire the
goodneſſe of our God herein. It is the buſineſſe of this day: Doe it fully,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:155875:12"/>
Let your ſpirits be raiſed up in admiration of Gods care and working
for his people. Let your hearts and tongues magnifie God, and ſay,
Great is the Lord, and great are his workes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and great deliverances
giveth he unto his people. Happy O people ſaved by the Lord. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
are they that be in ſuch a caſe: yea rather happy are they that have
the Lord for their God.</p>

                  <bibl>2 PET. 2. 9.</bibl>
                  <q>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of Temptation, and to reſerve the
unjuſt unto the day of judgement to be puniſhed.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have conſidered in the Morning the eſtate of the Godly
in reſpect of unjuſt men among whom they live: they are
under Temptation. We are now to conſider their eſtate in
reſpect of Gods care and aſpect to them. <hi>The Lord knoweth
how to deliver them.</hi> The Truth emergent from hence is
this. <hi>Though it be that the godly while they live among unjuſt men be in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation:
yet God knowes how to deliver them.</hi> This is the expreſſe aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Text. <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The phraſe [<hi>The Lord knoweth</hi>] imports both care, providence,
and vigilancy to deliver, and alſo skill and wiſdome how to contrive
it, and conſequently, certainty of deliverance. To like purpoſe are
many other places of holy Scripture, <hi>Pſal. 9. 9. The Lord alſo will be a
refuge for the oppreſſed, a refuge in times of Trouble, Pſal. 33. 18. Behold the
eye of the Lord is upon them that feare him: upon them that hope in his mercy, to
deliver their ſoule from death.</hi> To make this Truth a little more explicate,
we are to conſider, that this skill, vigilancy and providence of God in
delivering the godly out of Temptation,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Hath reference to divers ſorts of deliverance. There are divers
kinds of deliverance, and divers degrees in thoſe kindes. There is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
of the Soule from the wrath of God. <hi>Jeſus that delivereth from
the wrath to come, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 1. 10. A deliverance from the power and guilt
of ſinne, from the anguiſh and horrour of conſcience, from deſertion
and Apoſtaſy. There are deliverances of the body, of the naturall life,
from death, from teares, from ſickneſſe, from wants, from danger. The
Lord knowes how to accommodate his deliverance, to give deliverance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:155875:12"/>
according to what kind &amp; degree he thinks meet. Sometimes God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
from death, <hi>Pſa. 116. 8. Thou haſt delivered my ſoule from death.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by death, <hi>Iſa. 57. 1. The righteous periſheth and no man layeth it
to heart; and mercifull men are taken away, none conſidering that the righteous
is taken away from the evill to come.</hi> See, The Lord knowes ſundry wayes
of deliverance, not onely by keeping them from the hands of unjuſt
men, but ſometimes by letting them fall into their hands.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It hath reference to the perſons delivered. Sometimes
the Lord delivers many, ſometimes few, ſometimes whole Cities and
people, ſometimes a ſmall remnant in them, <hi>Rom. 9. 27. Iſa.</hi> 10. 22.
<hi>Though the number of the children of Iſrael be as the Sand of the Sea, a remnant
ſhall be ſaved:</hi> though there be great multitudes of men, yet a few ſhall
be delivered.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it hath reference to the meanes of deliverance. Sometimes
the Lord delivers by a viſible power, ſometimes the Lord delivers by
an inviſible working, ſometimes God delivers by putting a meere fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
into the mind of the enemy, ſomtimes by a reall accident unthought
of: 1 <hi>Sam. 23. 26, 27. Saul and his men, had encompaſſed David and his
men round about to take him. But there came a Meſſenger unto Saul, ſaying,
Haſte thee and come: for the Philiſtines have invaded the Land. Wherefore
Saul returned from purſuing after David, and went againſt the Philiſtines.</hi>
Sometimes the Lord delivers by an Angell, ſometimes by men. That
which the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28. 29. is true of the meanes of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
<hi>This alſo commeth forth from the Lord of hoaſts, who is wonderfull in
counſell, and excellent in working.</hi> That we leaſt dreame of, is oft times
the meanes of deliverance; that which we moſt hoped in, is oft times
moſt unprofitable to us.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It hath reference to the caſe of the perſons delivered.
Sometimes the unjuſt perſons be many, ſtrong, cunning, active, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
on the other ſide, the perſons delivered are few, weake, diſtracted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
fearefull, ſimple, yet notwithſtanding the Lord knowes how to deliver
them. Even theſe poore ones are preſerved, and thoſe ſtrong, cunning
and active men miſſe of their prey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It hath reference to the time of delivery. Gods skill, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy,
and providence is clearely ſeene, in the ſeaſon and opportunity
of deliverance, <hi>Iſa. 64. 3. Then didſt terrible things which we looked not
for:</hi> when the caſe of perſons reſcued is in appearance hopeleſſe, yet the
Lord knowes how to deliver even then.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It hath reference to the fruits and conſequent of the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.
There is a deliverance which is but incompleate: perſons are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:155875:13"/>
delivered from one judgement, but reſerved to another. The King of
<hi>Sodom</hi> was delivered from the Kings that came againſt him, but reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to fire and Brimſtone. Sometimes God gives a compleat delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that procures a continued peace. <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> was delivered from
the invaſion of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and the fruite of it was, <hi>the Realme was
quiet:</hi> for his God gave him reſt round about, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 30. Sometimes
God gives a deliverance which ends in triumph and glory; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a deliverance which leads to more temptations. God it may
be gives a deliverance to ſhew what he would doe if wee would cleave
to him: but becauſe of our forgetfulneſſe of God, our not rendring
againe according to his mercy, we may be delivered from one conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
ſo as to fall into another, from one evill ſo as to be reſerved to a
greater.</p>
               <p>The reaſons why God doth thus providently and skilfully deliver
the godly out of temptation are;</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe of his promiſe, God hath ingaged his word for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
of his people, <hi>Pſal. 50. 15. I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe they pray to him: in the ſame place he ſaith, <hi>Call
upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee.</hi> God will not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the prayer of the poore deſtitute, he will heare their cry. Though
it be that proud Atheiſticall perſons make no reckoning of prayer, as
if it could doe any thing for deliverance, yet ſure prayer is a mighty
engine with God, it is of ſingular force for deliverance. <hi>The effectuall
ſervent prayer of the righteous avayleth much, Jam.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe of his love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that makes him imploy his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and power for the deliverance of the godly, <hi>Deut. 33. 3. yea hee
loved the people; all his Saints are in thine hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe they reciprocally love God, and are tempted for his ſake.
<hi>For thy ſake we are killed all the day long and counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter,
Pſal.</hi> 44. 22. Therefore he muſt needs favour their cauſe, and be engaged
in point of honour to deliver them, <hi>Pſal. 91. 14. Becauſe he hath ſet his love
upon me, therefore will I deliver him.</hi> A good maſter will not ſuffer his
ſervant to miſcarry for his fidelitie in doing his buſineſſe. Surely God
that is the beſt maſter, who hath farre more goodneſſe then all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
will not faile to protect and reſcue his ſervants, his children, that
are in danger for his ſake. Beſides it concernes God to ſhew himſelfe
juſt, in righting the innocent, that he may make good his title, <hi>The God
of judgement. The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, Pſal.</hi> 1. 6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is by his righteouſneſſe bound to helpe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:155875:13"/>
Fiftly, the rage of the enemies is a ſufficient reaſon for God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
his people, and to imploy his providence and power for their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 27. ſaith God, <hi>I would make the remembrance of them to ceaſe
from among men, were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy leſt their
aduerſaries ſhould behave themſelves ſtrangely.</hi> The Lord intends to uſe
wicked men as his rod often times to ſcourge the godly: but he intends
they ſhould correct them, not deſtroy them, he would not have them
altogether unpuniſhed yet corrected in meaſure: hee would not have
them loſt though chaſtiſed. Therefore hee gives deliverance at laſt
though the enemy rage much; <hi>The rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt upon the
let of the righteous: leſt the righteous put forth their hand unto iniquity, Pſal.</hi>
125. 3. Becauſe he knowes the enemy is implacable, unmercifull, knowes
not how to put bounds to his rage, but acts in his fury <hi>ad extremum
virium,</hi> to the utmoſt of his power, therefore God ſets bounds to his
rage and curbs his fury, <hi>Pſal. 76. 10. Surely the wrath of man ſhall praiſe
thee: the remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtraine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, the preſumption and boaſting of the enemy is a great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to God to deliver his people. Thus the Pſalmiſt urgeth God to
remember <hi>the reproach of the enemy, the voyce of the enemy, Pſal.</hi> 74. 18. 23.
Becauſe they conſpire together, they ſay, <hi>Come let us deſtroy them all together,
let us out them off from being a nation, that the name of Iſrael may be no more
in Remembrance, Pſal. 83. 4. they ſay let us perſecute and take him, there is none
to deliver him,</hi> they magnifie their owne power, they deride the poore
godly man, as if there were no helpe for him in God, they promiſe to
themſelves ſatisfaction of their rage, malice, covetouſneſſe, therefore
God will diſappoint them. Becauſe of <hi>Senacheribs</hi> blaſphemy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
God delivered <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> Becauſe thy rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, and thy tumult is come up into mine eares: <hi>therefore will I put
my hooke into thy noſe, and my bridle in thy lips, &amp; I will turne thee backe by the
way by which thou cameſt,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 29. not onely by reaſon
of the cries of the oppreſſed, but alſo by reaſon of the bragges of proud
tongues that have ſaid, <hi>We will prevaile, who is Lord over us?</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaith God, <hi>I will ariſe, and ſet him in ſafety from him that p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ffeth at him,
Pſal. 12. v.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Applic.</hi> For Application. Firſt, this may ſerve to abate the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and boaſting of unrighteous men in their practiſes againſt the
godly. It is uſuall with ungodly perſons when they have hatched a
plot, when they have gathered a power, to inſnare and cruſh the godly
to promiſe themſelves certainty of prevayling becauſe of their cunning,
confederacy, ſecrecy: becauſe they conceive the godly have no power,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:155875:14"/>
or no wit to withſtand them. And therefore in the laying of all their
plots, in the purſuing of all their deſignes they make God as a cipher,
and vilifie godly perſons, as if they were a contemptible poore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
And all is becauſe they have no acquaintance with this truth
<hi>that God knowes how to deliver the godly out of temptation.</hi> Wherefore they
vaunt and boaſt themſelves: all their ſpeech is of their great multitude,
great partie, ſtrong power, good Commanders, wealthy men, cunning
plotters, firme union, theſe and ſuch like things they glory in. <hi>Senache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi>
makes no other account but to take <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by reaſon of his mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Chariots and horſemen, ſends word to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by <hi>Rabſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keh</hi>
to this purpoſe. <hi>Thinkeſt thou that thou ſhalt be delivered out of my hands?
I will give thee two thouſand horſes if thou be able on thy part to ſet riders
upon them.</hi> As if he had ſaid, thou haſt ſo few men as not to bee able to
furniſh two thouſand horſes with able riders, and how then canſt thou
ſtand againſt me who bring into the field hundreds of thouſands? The
ſame thought is in other ungodly perſons, they make no account but
to prevaile and carry the day becauſe of their multitude and confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
God is ſecluded from their thoughts, as if he were but a looker on
that did nothing. But as we uſe to ſay, they that reckon without their
hoſt muſt reckon againe: they that reckon without God make up an
eaſie reckoning, but a fooliſh one: they pleaſe themſelves in a vaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
which cannot hold. Experience might enforme them, that
when men preſume moſt, they faile moſt, and that Gods people are
then neareſt to deliverance when they are in appearance in the moſt
hopeleſſe condition; The reaſons hereof are evident. God knowes
how to deliver when man doth not, and when men ſay there is no
helpe for him in his God, then it is that God doth moſt certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
with deliverance. Out then with all theſe Atheiſticall thoughts,
as if the godly and their cauſe were loſt, when forces faile, enemies
grow potent, and are many in number. Let this one experiment of
this Cities deliverance teach you to ſee the preſumption of men to bee
a vaine thing. When almoſt was there a time wherein a City was nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
ſpoyling and deſtruction, and yet preſerved? The narration read to
you may eaſily give you to conceive how neere it was to be taken, how
great the preſumption of the plotters was of the ſucceſſe. Yet loe in
this one inſtance this truth verified, <hi>The Lord knoweth how to deliver the
godly out of Temptation:</hi> by his skill, and vigilancy we have had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Let not then proud ſpirits vaunt of their plot and power, but
remember what <hi>Jethro</hi> ſaid concerning the deliverance at the red Sea,
<hi>Exod. 18. 11. Now I know that the Lord is greater then all Gods: for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:155875:14"/>
in the thing wherein they dealt proudly hee was above them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This ſhould ſtrengthen our faith, and encourage us to ſeeke
unto God and rely upon him, even then when in our owne apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
we be at the weakeſt, and the enemy moſt potent. So did <hi>Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi>
2 <hi>Chron. 20. 12. O our God wilt thou not judge them? For wee have no
might againſt this great company that commeth againſt us: neither know wee
w<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>at to doe: but our eyes are upon thee.</hi> And a little after, <hi>verſ. 15. Bee not
afraid nor diſmayed by reaſon of this great multitude: for the battell is not yours
but Gods.</hi> Be it that wee be brought to great ſtraights, ſo that we ſee
no way of eſcape, no meanes of helpe, yet let our eyes be fixed on the
power that is above, ſtill keepe up your heart with prayer in depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon God. And let me tell you, that faith is as good as a whole
Army, yea it is more then great forces, By it the Saints have obtained
victories, eſcaped the edge of the Sword, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 34. Marke what <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nani</hi>
the Seer told <hi>Aſa, 2 Chron. 16. 7, 8, 9. Becauſe thou baſt relied on the
King of Syria, and not relied on the Lord thy God, therefore is the hoaſt of the
King of Syria eſcaped out of thine hand. Were not the Ethiopians and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
a huge hoaſt with very many Chariots and horſemen? yet becauſe thou didſt
relie on the Lord he delivered them into thine hand? For the eyes of the Lord run
to and fro thoorow out the whole earth to ſhew himſelfe ſtrong in the behalfe of
them whoſe heart is perfect toward him.</hi> The truth is: Faith is our greateſt
ſtrength; Armies be of no power without God, and when God makes an
Army to be a ſcourge to a people, it is likely becauſe they want faith in
God for deliverance. Oh that then our hearts might be eſtabliſhed upon
God, whatever ſtraights wee are brought to, that wee could learne to
cling, and reſt, and hang upon him by faith, though outward helpe
faile. He is the Lord of hoſts, the God of all power and wiſedome:
Let our faith in God be ſtrong, though the arme of fleſh wee uſe bee
weake.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if God be ſo expert in deliverance, we ſhould learne to waite
upon God, and to ſtay his time for deliverance. God doth not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
according to thy will, but according to his owne purpoſe, and
therefore we ſhould quiet our ſelves in his wiſedome and care, patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtaying till he be pleaſed to ſend deliverance. We are ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
Gods worke, to preſcribe the way and time of deliverance,
and if they faile to begin to grow weary with waiting, yea to draw
deſperate concluſions therefrom, and all is becauſe wee have not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
this leſſon, that the Lord knoweth how to deliver when man doth
not; that his wayes are unſearchable and paſt finding out by us, that
he reſerveth the ordering of meanes, the time when, and the extent of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:155875:15"/>
deliverance how farre it ſhall reach. Learne then to bee contented
though hee diſappoint thee in the way of deliverance thou fixeſt thy
thoughts and hopes on, and keepe up thy confidence in God his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
and power. Remember that of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa. 28. 16. He that
believeth ſhall not make haſte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, if it be the Lord that knowes how to deliver, then when
we have deliverance, we muſt remember to magnifie his wiſedom, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
care, vigilancy and providence. And this is the proper buſineſſe
of this day. God hath given a great deliverance to this Citie. And I
beſeech you to conſider to whom it can bee aſcribed but to him. It
were extreame ſottſhneſſe for any man to imagine that ſuch a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
came by chance, that it was hap-hazzard, uncertaine blinde For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that did ſo diſcover and prevent a plot ſo long before contrived,
and ſo neere the accompliſhment, nor can it be conceived to have been
by the foreſight of men. The truth is, all ſorts of perſons were in a
dubious and trembling condition. A plot was feared, but what it
might be, or what way to diſcover it, I ſuppoſe the Agents in the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
knew not till God directed ſome unexpectedly to give intelligence.
Thoſe that ſate at the ſterne here will acknowledge they were at a ſtand,
and knew not what to doe: thoſe that ſeemed beſt to underſtand the
ſtate of things, here conceived them in a hopeleſſe condition. If then it
cannot be aſcribed to fortune, or to men, to whom ſhall wee aſcribe
the delivery but to God? Doubtleſſe they ſhew themſelves arrant fooles,
groſſe doaters, ſottiſh perſons, ſtupid wretches, that will not ſay, <hi>Digitus
Dei eſt hic,</hi> herein is the finger of God. That a plot contrived with ſo
much cunning, brought on ſo neere to an iſſue, ſhould even then bee
diſcovered, even then be prevented when it was to be acted, with ſuch
a mercifull preſervation of thoſe againſt whom it was intended, bindes
us to give great praiſe unto God. Let us then with our whole heart
acknowledge, that great hath the wiſedome, providence and vigilancy
of God beene over this place in diſcovering and preventing this plot.</p>
               <p>To make us more ſenſible hereof, let us conſider the greatneſſe of the
delivery by the number of perſons delivered, even many thouſands of
lives in all likelihood, a whole City, and a great City preſerved. Yea
doubtleſſe thoſe that conceived themſelves ſafe enough have cauſe to
acknowledge their deliverance. Let men dreame of a word or a ſigne
as a ſecuritie for them; alas! in a furious concourſe, while men are in
heate of blood, doe yee thinke they can attend to obſerve and marke a
word, a little white Tape in the boſome or in the hat? Alas! who
may not eaſily conceive that in ſuch a confuſion as muſt needs have been
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:155875:15"/>
at the riſing up and entring of ſo great forces into a City, in ſuch hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
burly, in ſuch fighting there would have beene little diſtinction
made of inhabitants, yea poſſibly (as is uſuall in ſuch fights) their
owne Forces ſome of them might have ſuffered as enemies. It is eaſie
to conceive that not onely goods, but alſo perſons would have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together. And therefore they that imagined themſelves ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
by reaſon of the good will they thought the parties plotting
and invading did beare to them, yet have reaſon to acknowledge a
great deliverance of them in the diſappointing of this Plot, not onely
the perſons particularly deſigned to deſtruction, but alſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of thoſe who thought themſelves ſafe enough, would have beene
involved in the common ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let us conſider the greatneſſe of the deliverance in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of it. Though many thouſands were deſtinate to deſtruction, yet
not the haire of one mans head loſt, not one drop of blood ſhed, not
one perſon that we know of loſt, no not ſo much as one Peny: this
was a great deliverance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let us conſider the greatneſſe of the deliverance by the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the meanes. A deliverance in a manner without any helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a great Power: without any foreſight againſt a vigilant enemy:
that God might have all the glory, and man onely the knowledge of
his owne weakeneſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, a deliverance in a deſperate caſe, when the enemy was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
when the preſerved were fearefull.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, a deliverance in the very nicke of time, immediately before the
plot ſhould have beene acted.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, a deliverance that hath vouchſafed to make for the preſent,
the place ſafe, the inhabitants in a better poſture for the future, which
may in probability tend to the peace of the whole kingdome. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it bee that things ſucceed, yet ſurely there could not bee a way in
likelihood that might have tended to the ſhortning of this warre, and
ſo conſequently to the peace and quietneſſe of this kingdome more
effectuall then this, that God was pleaſed to deliver this City: And
which is of all the moſt bleſſed effect, it hath redounded to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by many thankſgivings to him, which we this day with the accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of our ſoules give unto him: and I doubt not but that it will
tend much to the undeceiving of the people from thoſe hard thoughts
they have had of the godly as turbulent, and diſcover the deepe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes
that is in the hearts of malignant ſpirits, notwithſtanding all their
pretences, ſo that I hope in time it ſhall be that as in the dayes of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:155875:16"/>
ſo God will bring it to paſſe that no dog ſhall move his tongue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his people, and all will ſee a neceſſity of reformation in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline
of the Church, which is the great deſire of all the godly in the
Land. I will expreſſe my conceits unto you. I have conceived this plot
in the intention of it, and many circumſtances in it very like that ever
to be abhorred Maſſacre at <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth of
<hi>France,</hi> and the diſcovery and diſappointment like unto that of the
Caſtle and Citie of <hi>Dublin</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſomewhat more then a yeare ſince,
by which although the warre and miſery of that kingdome hath not
beene altogether prevented, yet hath beene through the Almighties
ſole power in a great meaſure leſſened. Doubtleſſe the ſame ſpirit of
Antichriſt hath moved in all theſe plots, and this preſent warre is ſet
on foot by the ſame <hi>Jeſuiticall Achitophels,</hi> by the ſame <hi>Catholique
league.</hi> It is the ſame plot that began in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but lighted on <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and now in a heavy manner of <hi>England.</hi> It is plaine enough to
every one that will conſider the agents, the circumſtances of it that it
is the plot of Papiſts, and Jeſuited ſpirits to root out the Proteſtant
Religion under other pretences. And God doth begin now to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it, and I doubt not but will more diſcover it, and cleare the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of his people, and adde deliverances to them, but ruine and
downefall to that Antichriſtian ſtate. What are wee to doe this day
but to acknowledge the greatneſſe of this deliverance, to magnifie
God our deliverer, and cauſe the voyce of his praiſe to bee heard; to
rejoyce in Gods worke which he hath done? Though we may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in the miſery of any man as delighting in it, though we are not
to inſult over them, but to pity them, who did not pity us, though
we are not to reproach them, but to pray for them, that God would
ſoften their hearts and open their eyes, that they may ſee againſt whom
they ſtrive; yet for as much as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The righteous ſhall
rejoyce when he ſeeth the venge mee, he ſhall waſh his feet in the blood of the
wicked, Pſal.</hi> 58. 10. that God may bee magnified wee are to rejoyce
that they are caſt downe, and that God hath vouchſafed unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
a day of deliverance, and (bleſſed be his name) a day of thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
without any interruption. I beſeech you let not this mercy be loſt,
keepe a yearely memoriall of it, let not this day be loſt, ſpend it not
onely in eaſe from labour and carnall mirth, but remember that <hi>Deus
nobis haec <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ti<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fecit,</hi> God hath done this great thing for us, and let our
rejoycing be in God, our prayſes of him, <hi>Oh prayſe our God all yee peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and let the voyce of his praiſe he heard, which endues our ſoule with life, and
ſuffereth not our feet to ſlip.</hi> And in your praiſes obſerve theſe directions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:155875:16"/>
Firſt, remember the great deliverance of all deliverances, even the
deliverance which the Lord Jeſus the great Captaine of our Salvation
hath gotten for us by his death over Hell and Death. Every delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
we have from the inferiour inſtruments of Satan the great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
ſhould lead to the remembrance of the grand deliverance from Hell
eternally to be remembred.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let this deliverance confirme your faith, &amp; erect your hope
in expectation of thoſe great diliverances which all Gods people long
for, even the great deliverance from Antichriſt when God will judge the
whore, and avenge the ſea of blood that hath beene drunke theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundreds of yeares by that cruell dominion of the Papacy, which
all that love Jeſus Chriſt doe earneſtly pray for and endeavour: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
from <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> when their great multitudes ſhall bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne:
the deliverance from the grave, when the Earth and the Sea
ſhall give up their dead. Learne we to argue as the Apoſtle doth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 10. <hi>who delivered us from ſo great death,</hi> and doth deliver; in whom
we truſt that he will yet deliver us. God hath delivered this Citie and
therefore will deliver his Church which is his owne City. It is the
argumentation of the Apoſtle here. God delivered <hi>Noah</hi> from the old
world at the deluge, he delivered <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and therefore, <hi>God
knoweth how to deliver the godly out of Temptation.</hi> One deliverance is
enough to conclude a ſucceſſion of deliverances. All Gods deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are grounded upon the ſame reaſon, and therefore the aſſurance of
one is a confirmation of our faith concerning all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, learne to delight thy ſelfe in God, learne to glory and make
thy boaſt in him. Say as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> himſelfe acknowledged, <hi>Dan.</hi>
3. 29. <hi>There is no other God that can deliver after this ſort.</hi> We that hope in
the living God, that truſt in Chriſt Jeſus ſhould raiſe our ſpirits to an
high and holy magnanimity and courage in our God, deſpiſe the Idols
that ſuperſtitious perſons magnify. Hath God delivered us? Hath the
Sonne of God ſaved us? away then with Croſſes, Crucifixes, dead Saints,
Images, Reliques, breaden Gods; they are but dead things, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deliver, they are but vanitie and lies, there is no breath, there is no
truſt in them. Let us exalt our God and ſay, Our God is the living
God &amp; an everlaſting King, the portion of <hi>Jacob</hi> is not like them, <hi>Iſrael</hi>
is the rod of his inheritance, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. Our God is a God that can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
and doth deliver, and will deliver. Let the experiment of Gods
deliverance raiſe our hearts to an high apprehenſion of the power, and
excellency and worthineſſe of our God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, let us cleave ſtedfaſtly to our God. Hath God ſtood to us?
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:155875:17"/>
let us ſtand faſt to him: ſtand to his truth by profeſſing, to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
by obeying them, ſtand unto his people by appearing for them,
ſtand to his cauſe by engaging our ſelves in it, ſtand to Gods Name
by truſting on it. Doth God deliver the Godly? Oh prize godlineſſe
then as great gaine, as profitable for all things. Doth God heare prayers?
Oh then let us uſe prayers to God. Let us contradict ſinners, and ſay,
It is not in vaine to ſerve God, that there is profit in keeping his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and that we walke mournfully before the Lord of hoaſts, <hi>Mal.</hi>
3. 14. Let us returne and diſcerne between the righteous and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
betweene him that ſerveth God and him that ſerveth him not, <hi>v.</hi> 18.
To manifeſt which I ſhould proceed to handle the other Concluſion
in the Text, <hi>The Lord knoweth how to reſerve the unjuſt to the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be puniſhed;</hi> but time will not permit.</p>
