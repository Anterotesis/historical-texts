            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I lately received Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Command for Printing the Sermon I Preached at Your last Solemn Ordination, I thought Your Lordships Authority and Judgment ought to Over-rule my own Inclinations; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Experience of a former Storm, on a like Occasion, might justly make me unwilling to
<pb facs="tcp:51248:3"/>
venture abroad again, unless there were some Hopes of a Calmer Season. But whatever the Issue be, I have the Satisfaction of doing my Duty; and I hope others will have so much, at least in Reading it, as to be convinced, how unjustly I have been, not long since, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World, as an Enemy to <hi>the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Churches in general, and to the Constitution of this Church in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Calumny so groundless and ridiculous, that the Authour of it doth not produce one considerable <hi>Argument</hi> (for I envy him not the rare Embellishments of his Style) to prove <hi>the Church a distinct Society;</hi> which I had not made use of to that Purpose in a Discourse published above Twenty years since.</p>
            <p>But this must never be taken notice of, nor any of those passages in my later Writings; wherein I had fully asserted and vindicated the <hi>Churches Power</hi> in general, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Constitution</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> lest the World should laugh at the Folly and Malice of such an unskilfull Maker of Controversies, who follows the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> onely in two things, <hi>viz.</hi> a Barbarous Style, and a Rude Way of Disputing with his Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51248:3"/>
But that is a small thing with him, who in one <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the subject of Church Power,</hi> p. <hi>514.</hi>
               </note> single Page of his Book, charges no less than two of our Renowned Archbishops, <hi>Whitgift</hi> and <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and the Learned Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester, Bilson,</hi> with Writing <hi>Inconsiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and that for a new sort of <hi>Henrician Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, viz.</hi> deriving the Magistrates Power from <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Person had not with great humility written himself the <hi>Vicar of Cosmus Blene,</hi> one might have thought, by these passages, he had fancied himself another kind of <hi>Vicar;</hi> especially, when he proceeds so like a <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Controversies,</hi> and after an imperious manner, summons me, by a kind of <hi>Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to answer to such Questions as he should demand of me; but out of Respect to Your Lordships Authority, and Jurisdiction over me, I declined giving any Answer to him. And he hath since Printed his <hi>Monitory Letter</hi> in the Preface to his Book. Therefore left my silence on this Occasion, should make others think, there were some ground for such a Publick Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me; I shall, in few words, lay open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Your Lordship, (to whom I owe an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Actions) the Nature and Merits of this Cause, and the onely Foundation of all this Noise and Clamour, that Your Lordship
<pb facs="tcp:51248:4"/>
may Judge, how well I am treated by this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of his Brethren.</p>
            <p>It happen'd, my Lord, that in my younger days (about Twenty five years since) I thought it necessary to inform my self, as well as I could; in the state of the Controversie about <hi>Church Government,</hi> which had been managed with so much Heat among us, and was then like to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived. And to that end I applied my self to the Reading and Considering the Authours of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est esteem on both sides; and by diligent peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of them, I thought them more happy, in overthrowing each others <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> than in setting up their own. And supposing no better Reasons could be produced than I found in them, I from thence concluded, that the Form of <hi>Church Government</hi> was left at Liberty by any Law of <hi>Christ,</hi> and was therefore to be determined, as served best to the great Ends of Peace and Order; which were the plain and standing Laws of the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>To make this more clear, I considered the Nature and Force of Laws; what there was in the Christian Society, which was taken from the Law of Nature, what from Divine Positive Laws; whether the Places of Scripture, or Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Antiquity, or Reformed Churches, did determine this Matter. All which being put
<pb facs="tcp:51248:4"/>
together, I did adventure to publish at that time, hoping by that means to bring over those to a Compliance with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> (then like to be Re-established) who stood off upon the Supposition, that <hi>Christ</hi> had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> to be always continued in his Church; and therefore they thought <hi>Prelacy</hi> was to be detested, as an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Usurpation. In the very first Chapter of the Book I set my self to Answer the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Arguments, without mentioning their Books, in which they may be still seen, and so <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jus Divinum Regiminis Ecclesiastici,</hi> &amp;c.</note> quite through I omitted nothing that was pleaded by them against Submission to Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government. And I dare challenge any Man to produce one Passage in the whole Book that tended to incourage Faction or Schism, or Opposition to the <hi>Church</hi> of England; but on the contrary, I endeavour'd to recommend the Episcopal Government, as having the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of all others, and coming nearest to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical Practice; and I concluded all with the Proposal of <hi>King Charles I.</hi> at the end of his second Paper at the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> as most highly just and reasonable, viz. <hi>The reducing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy and Presbytery to such a well-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd Form of Superiority and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, as may best resemble the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51248:5"/>
               <hi>and Primitive times, so far forth as the different condition of the times, and the exigences of all considerable circumstances will admit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, You see my Crime; and if in this last I erred, it was with a most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prince, and a True Friend to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> whose Sufferings could never make him warp from what his Conscience and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment directed.</p>
            <p>I do not deny, my Lord, that I do now think much more is to be said for the <hi>Apostolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Episcopacy,</hi> than I at that time apprehended (as will fully appear in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Sermon:)</hi> But I confess, I yet see no Cause for such Clamours against this Book, as though nothing could satisfie but a <hi>Recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, as Publick as the Errour, Scandal and Offence given by it.</hi> These are the Terms prescribed me by the Lofty <hi>Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> of <hi>Cosmus Blene;</hi> but they are, in Truth, a Reflexion on all my <hi>Superiours in the Church,</hi> who, for so long a time, have been pleased to treat me with more Kindness, than so much as to mention any such thing to me, with respect to that <hi>unlucky Book,</hi> as my <hi>Accuser</hi> calls it. For they were so wise, to consider the Time when
<pb facs="tcp:51248:5"/>
it was Written, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Church was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>established; And with what Design it was Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>viz.</hi> to gain upon the Dissenters from our Church. And it did not want Success that way, both here, and in a Neighbour King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But suppose there were <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Mistakes</hi> in it (as no doubt there were) they were so wise to make Allowances for the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalness and Injudiciousness of Youth, and for the Prejudices of Education. All Men are not so happy to be born or bred in settled times, when they have had no Temptation to think otherwise than they doe: but suppose a Man brought up when all things are in Confusion, and every one at liberty to chuse his own Way; Was it not a fair step towards the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> even then to receive <hi>Episcopal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and to follow the Directions of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Bishop of this Church? Which things I can truely affirm of my self at that time. And for many years since it is well known, that besides the constant Duties of my Place (in which I have always opposed Faction and Schism) I have made it my Business to defend the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> against its Enemies on both sides.</p>
            <p>But it seems nothing can Atone for such an <hi>Errour</hi> with these Implacable Men, but a <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Recantation.</hi> And are we sure that will
<pb facs="tcp:51248:6"/>
doe it? It seems to me to be a Commendable Piece of Ingenuity in any Person, to Retract a former Opinion upon full Conviction, when it proceeds from Judgment and Choice; (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Man is but like a Speaking-Trumpet, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Words which others put into him:) but yet some Men love to be still rubbing upon the old sore, and upbraiding such a Man with what he hath Publickly Disowned, and with his very disowning of it: Which looks, as if they were glad he had been in the Wrong, and were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he should be otherwise. So that, when Men are resolved to find Fault with others, no <hi>Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> can doe them good; but it is very hard for us now to be under such a rigorous Dispensation, which makes every slip unpardonable. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when it is set up by those, who have been such Offenders themselves. For some of these are most apt to be severe towards others; as if it were some Atonement for their own Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, to be always finding fault with their Brethren. And I heartily wish, my Enemies have none greater to answer for, than such as arise from too great a zeal for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> among our selves. Yet if even therein I have gone beyond my bounds, I beg pardon of my <hi>Superiours;</hi> Since it is too evident, that an untractable Spirit on one side, as well as a
<pb facs="tcp:51248:6"/>
pretence to an Infallible Spirit on the other, render all Projects of Accommodation useless.</p>
            <p>This I mention, my Lord, because I hear some Proposals of mine, when I was Writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> have given offence to some, and have been made use of to ill purposes by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But those who consider the Design and Tendency of them, and the Circumstances of that Time when they were made, will see no Cause to pass any severe Censure upon one, who De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to serve the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> by them; as the <hi>Dissenters</hi> themselves confessed, and thought they would end in the Ruin of the Separation; and therefore never thanked me for them.</p>
            <p>And now I hope Your Lordships Goodness (of which I have had so large Experience) will excuse all this Unpleasant Discourse (as usually Apologies are) but since my Accuser thinks <hi>Posterity</hi> will be concerned <hi>in his Writings in this Cause</hi> (I dare say not to make a Pattern for <hi>Style</hi> out of them) I was willing to take this opportunity to clear my self for once, to Your Lordship and the World.</p>
            <p>As to his Accusation about <hi>Archbishop Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s MSS. I think he hath heard enough of that already: and he owes me a <hi>Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation</hi> upon his own Terms, for charging me,
<pb facs="tcp:51248:7"/>
with <hi>Unfaithfulness</hi> therein, for the <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Offence</hi> hath been very Publick.</p>
            <p>I am afraid I have exercised Your Lordships Patience too long, and therefore humbly beg your Lordships Blessing upon,</p>

            <p n="1">(1.) That this Church at <hi>Ephesus</hi> was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly beyond the compass of a <hi>particular Congregation;</hi> or else St. <hi>Paul</hi> had very little success in all the Pains he took there; which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51248:8"/>
he so <note n="l" place="margin">Act. 20. 20. 25.</note> particularly mentions in the solemn leave he took of the <hi>Elders</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> whom he sent for to <hi>Miletus.</hi> And St. <hi>Luke</hi> speaking of <hi>the Jews and Greeks dwelling in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,</hi> saith, <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 19. 17. 20.</note> 
               <hi>That fear fell on them all, and the Name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. So mightily grew the Word of God, and prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself takes notice, <note n="n" place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 8, 9.</note> that <hi>at Ephesus a great and effectual Door was open'd unto him.</hi> What, for one single <hi>Congregational Church</hi> to be formed, in so great a City, with all the success St. <hi>Paul</hi> had in his Preaching there; when, in far less time, he planted so many Churches in other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces!</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That the Extent of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Care did reach beyond the Bounds of the City: it being very improbable, that those of <hi>Asia</hi> should so long hear St. <hi>Paul</hi> Preach at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> and yet <hi>no Churches</hi> be founded, by his means, in any of the neighbour Cities.</p>
            <p>But withall, it seems probable to me, that the <hi>Elders</hi> of those <hi>Churches</hi> were not as yet removed from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, with a design to fix them in their several Stations; For it is observable, that <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 10. 17. 20.</note> St. <hi>Paul sent to Ephesus for the Elders of the Church to come to Miletus;</hi> whereas, if they had been dispersed, he would have sent to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51248:9"/>
their several Places of abode; and yet when they came to <hi>Miletus</hi> from <hi>Ephesus</hi> (which were not far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, <note n="p" place="margin">

Some have thought these words relate to the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of <hi>Penitents,</hi> and not to the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> before mentioned; because it immediately follows, <hi>neither be partaker of other mens sins;</hi> but I see no Cause to recede from the Sense gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received, for these Reasons,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Because St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not mentioned <hi>laying on of hands</hi> in relation to <hi>Penitents;</hi> but he had done it in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>Ordination;</hi> and that in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s own Case; wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> as the principal Person did in an Authoritative manner, <hi>lay on his hands,</hi> as himself expresses it, in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Epistle;</hi> and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> assisted in <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 6.</note> 
               <hi>laying on their hands,</hi> to manifest their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and Approbation: but <hi>the laying on of hands</hi> is no where in these <hi>Epistles,</hi> appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 14.</note> to the other Sense; nor in any other place of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If these words do not <hi>relate</hi> to <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have given <hi>Timothy</hi> no particular direction, about that which was one main part of his Office. As it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed concerning <hi>Titus, That he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ordain Elders in every City:</hi> And no doubt <hi>Timothy</hi> had the same <hi>Commission,</hi> which is no where intimated but in these wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

(3.) Supposing, <hi>laying on of hands</hi> then equally used in both Cases, yet the Apostle gives no Rules concerning the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of <hi>Penitents,</hi> as he doth concerning <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> and therefore we have more cause to apply it according to the chief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and design of this Epistle; but he saith nothing before, what <hi>Penitents</hi> were to be reconciled; and after what time, and under what Conditions they were to have <hi>hands laid on them in</hi> token of Reconciliation. And there is no concurrent <hi>Evidence</hi> of such a Practice, so early in the Christian Church.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) The following words are capable of a very good meaning, acccording to this Sense. For then <hi>being partaker of other mens Sins,</hi> doth imply, that as it is a Fault in those who rudely, and inconsiderately, without due preparation of Mind, do rush upon so Sacred an Office; so those cannot acquit themselves of a great share in their Guilt, who do not use their best endeavours, by due <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> and <hi>Trial</hi> of the Persons, to keep them from entring upon it, till they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and qualified for it.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) The great use of the <hi>laying on of hands</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> is for the setting Persons apart for the discharge of a Sacred Office. So, when the Office of <hi>Deacons</hi> was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51248:12"/>
first instituted, it is said, <hi>They were set before</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 6. 6.</note> 
               <hi>the Apostles, and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</hi> And which is more considerable; when <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> by the particular appointment of <hi>the Holy Ghost, were to be separated unto the Work whereto God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 13. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>had called them;</hi> it is said, <hi>And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</hi> Here it was not for <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cures,</hi> as the <hi>Apostles</hi> sometimes used <note place="margin">Mark 16. 18 Act. 28. 8. Act. 8. 15. 15. 19. 6.</note> it to Sick Persons; nor for conferring <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Gifts of the Holy Ghost,</hi> as at other times they used it; (and probably this was <hi>the Gift of God</hi> which <hi>Timothy</hi> had, by <hi>laying on of the</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Ruling well;</hi> Not, in opposition to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was to <hi>Rule them well;</hi> nor so as to imply, that the entire Power of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was lodged in a <hi>College of Presbyters</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hier. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in Epist. ad</hi> Tit.</note> then, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> imagins; for what had <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> then to doe in the governing them?

               <hi>Elder</hi> here in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Epistle were the same: Doth this prove, that these Govern'd the Church without <hi>Timothy?</hi> The true Question is not, about the Sense of <hi>Words,</hi> but about the <hi>Authority</hi> of these <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> i. e. Whether the whole Care of their Churches were committed to them, without any Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Jurisdiction? What if it be yielded to St. <hi>Jerome, That the Bishops and Deacons at</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Philippi were no other than the Presbyters and Deacons;</hi> as long as the Apostle, either in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or by some other appointed by himself, did rule over them? What, <hi>if the Bishops summon'd to Miletus, were no other than the Pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that it doth no where appear in Scripture, that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were invested in the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> over the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet they were not excluded from all kind of share in the <hi>Government,</hi> for then they could never be said <hi>to Rule well,</hi> who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to doe in Government: And those who are under a <hi>Supreme</hi> may be called. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> and are to be obey'd according to <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 14.</note> the Nature of their <hi>Authority;</hi> which doth relate to Men in another capacity, and for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51248:14"/>
very different ends from what Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth.</p>
            <p>For the Church is a Society in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Design, Duties, Offices, Censures, really distinct from any mere Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. And no Christian, who believes that the Kingdom of the <hi>Messias</hi> was to be an external, visible Kingdom, can be of another Opinion. And although Christ be <hi>the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Revel. 17. 14. 19. 16.</note> 
               <hi>as Kings</hi> they are subject to him; yet that Authority which Christian Kings do exercise over their Subjects, doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Rules and Orders which himself hath establish'd in his Church. For no Power derived from him can void or destroy his own Laws and Institutions. Since then the Church doth subsist by virtue of Christ's own Appointment, and that Church is to have peculiar Officers to instruct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it, it must follow, that even in a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kingdom,</hi> the Church is a Society distinct from the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Labouring in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> Not to distinguish them from another sort of <hi>Elders,</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> never thought of: For he knew of none but such as were set apart by <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Work of the Ministery; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51248:14"/>
if St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Elder</hi> were the same, they must have the same <hi>qualifications;</hi> and one of the chief of them is, <hi>that he be apt to teach;</hi> so that they may as well plead for a <hi>Lay Bishop,</hi> as for a <hi>Lay Elder;</hi> or else the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> must be <hi>one apt to teach,</hi> if the same with <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 2.</note> the <hi>Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some may say, 
<q>There was then indeed great need of <hi>labouring in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> when the Christian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was not well known, or understood in the World; But what necessity is there of it now, when all People own the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christianity among us? And this continual Preaching doth but fill the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples heads with too much Knowledge, and makes them more opinionative, and less capable of being governed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Answer,
If <hi>Christ</hi> appointed Preachers onely for the Conversion of Infidels, this Argument would have great force: But the Apostle tells us, That Christ hath appointed in his Church, not onely <hi>Apostles and Evangelists, but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the Body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect</hi> 
               <note place="margin">13.</note>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:51248:15"/>
               <hi>Man, unto the measure of the stature of the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ.</hi> Therefore as long as the Church is in its imperfect State, as long as it may want Unity or Knowledge, or Improvement, this Office of Teachers is to continue. And those <hi>Elders</hi> will still deserve <hi>double honour,</hi> who do not perfunctorily and rarely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this Duty, but who <hi>do labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are indeed many sorts of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which the Church stands in no need of, because they tend so little to Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Such are all fine Harangues in the Pulpit, <hi>i. e.</hi> Words well put together with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out suitable Matter; All dry, flat, insipid Discourses, about things of no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to Mens Salvation; All affectations of Jingling Sentences, Farfetched Allusions, Elaborate Trifles; All impertinent Disputes about needless, vain, intricate Controversies; All Enthusiastick unintelligible Talk, which tends to confound Mens Notions of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to evaporate the true Spirit of it into Fancies and Eastern Modes of speaking: Lastly, All Corrupt and Seditious Doctrine, which Poisons the Minds of People, with dangerous Errours, or Factious Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:51248:15"/>
But setting all these aside, there remains a Grave, Serious, Pious, Affectionate, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing way of Preaching; which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, in its degree, for the same ends for which the holy Scripture is usefull, viz. <hi>for Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Righteousness,</hi> i. e. for the best purposes in the World. And can any think such a Work to be now unnecessary, as long as Men have Consciences to be awaken'd, Errours to be confuted, Vices to be reform'd, and stand so much in need of good direction in the way to Heaven?</p>
            <p>Can we be employ'd about a better or more usefull Work than this? While the Souls of those under our Care, are in such perpetual danger, either of being overspread with Errours, or overcome with Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or overset with Difficulties, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with Fears? When should the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots shew their Skill and Courage, and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but when the Sea is rough, and the Weather Tempestuous, and Banks of Sand appear of one side, and Rocks on the other, and so many Wrecks before them; and the common Mariners are bold and unskilfull, unable to govern, and impatient of being govern'd? Is it time then to say, There is no need of Pilots now, but they may lie in their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51248:16"/>
Cabins and sleep, for the Ship will steer it self well enough, and the Mariners cannot fail of their Duty, as long as the Coasts are known, and the Rocks have been discover'd to them?</p>
            <p>It is very true, that the way to Heaven is not now hard to find; but it is no easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bring Men to look in earnest after it, or to keep them in it. And here lies the main of our Work of Preaching; We are not to teach Men new Doctrines, but to Clear, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and Apply the old, to the Consciences of Men. It is very easie to shoot over the Peoples heads, and to spend an hour to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no purpose; but it requires all our skill to Preach plainly without flatness; and to set the Matters of Religion in the best light, and to recommend them to the Minds of People, with the greatest force of Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. It is no hard matter to trifle away the time, but it is not so to speak Suitably, Warmly and Effectually to the Hearts of our Hearers; to make them find the same effect of our Preaching, which the two Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did, when Christ unknown was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with them; <hi>When they said to one another, Did not our hearts burn within us while</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 32.</note> 
               <hi>he talked with us, and while he open<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to us the Scriptures?</hi> That is then the best way of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51248:16"/>
Preaching, which hath Light and Heat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; which clears the Scriptures to the Peoples Capacities, and warms their Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Spiritual things. And it is hardly possible to mistake, as to the best Method of Preaching, if Men do but judge aright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the End and Design of it. For there must be Strength and Clearness to convince; and a close Application to Mens Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to Excite and Persuade them to the Practice of those things which Men can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ignorant of, and yet are very backward to doe. And therefore this must be the chief Work and Business of our Preaching.</p>
            <p>Which none ought to undervalue or be asham'd of, who do in earnest believe God and another World; none ought to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, whose peculiar Office and Dignity it is to take Care of Mens Souls; and none will be careless in it, who have a regard to their own or others Souls. <hi>For in doing this,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 16.</note> saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> speaking of his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in his Function, <hi>Thou shalt both sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thy self and them that hear thee;</hi> as though a Man's own Salvation, and that of his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, went together. That is indeed the most desirable thing in the World to be the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of carrying Souls to Heaven; <hi>for they</hi>

               <hi>the stars for ever and ever:</hi> but yet, the most carefull Endeavours do not always meet with Success; and even our Blessed Saviour's Preaching, <hi>who spake as never man spake,</hi> was ineffectual to many; (What then may we expect!) But this is our Duty, and the most likely way of doing good to Souls, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by our Saviour's own Practice; and if we do not meet with success to our desires, let us not give over doing our Duty; and say, <hi>We have labour'd in vain, and spent our</hi>

               <hi>strength for nought and in vain; for surely our judgment is with the Lord, and our Work with our God,</hi> as the Prophet speaks; and if we fail of a Recompence in this World, we shall not in another.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And so I come from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Office,</hi> to the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Conferring</hi> it; these words implying it to belong to <hi>Timothy,</hi> as being spoken particularly to him, <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man.</hi> For although he often speaks of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> before; yet he gives no charge about <hi>Ordination,</hi> but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>True, <hi>some say,</hi> in this particular Case; but this was by virtue of an <hi>Extraordinary Commission</hi> given to him, as an <hi>Evangelist</hi> by St. <hi>Paul:</hi> But what is this to the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51248:17"/>
Rule and Practice of the Church in succeeding Ages? which is not to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <q>To make this Matter as clear as I can I shall recommend these things to consideration.</q>
            <p>(I. <hi>Consid.)</hi> That from hence appears evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, That the <hi>Apostolical Power</hi> of <hi>Governing Churches,</hi> and <hi>Ordaining Elders</hi> in them, was not limited to the Persons of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but was capable of being communicated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom the Apostle entrusted with it. And this is a very material Point, to Prove, that this Power was not so peculiar to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but it might be transmitted to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and therefore might be continued in the Church.</p>
            <p>But the great Objection against <hi>Timothy's</hi> being a Pattern for <hi>Episcopal Power,</hi> is this; <q>That it appears by Scripture, he was sent up and down to several Places, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought fit.

be delegated to others in their stead. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a longer or shorter time, whether while the Apostles went up and down, or near their Decease, makes no difference, as to the Point of Delegation. And if it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that such an Apostolical Power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Churches might be committed to others, and was actually so by the <hi>Apostles;</hi> then there is no more to be done, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether upon their Remove, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, they did entrust any Persons in such a manner, as it is certain from Scripture Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Timothy,</hi> as to the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> when he went into <hi>Macedonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some think, that St. <hi>Paul's</hi> leaving <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> was upon his return out of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> when he was going up to <hi>Jerusalem, knowing that they should see his face no more;</hi> and that while he staid for him at <hi>Troas,</hi> he sent this <hi>Epistle</hi> to him. But St. <hi>Paul's</hi> words are too plain to be avoided, that he left him at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which can never be interpreted <hi>returning from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia.</hi> And there was as much need of one to look after the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was then absent in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> as when he went to <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> and so <note n="l" place="margin">Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. <hi>Praefat. in Epist.</hi> Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</note> 
               <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> understands it. But if <hi>Timothy</hi> were then with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as appears by his being
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51248:19"/>
at <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 20. 4. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Troas,</hi> when he went from thence to <hi>Miletus,</hi> that was sufficient Reason why he did not address himself to him, but to the <hi>Elders which came from Ephesus;</hi> whom he put in mind of their Duty by his <hi>Speech,</hi> as he had done <hi>Timothy</hi> by an <hi>Epistle</hi> not long before directed to him.</p>
            <p>Whose Office was no more superseded by this Charge given to them; than a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consuls</hi> was by the <hi>Senats</hi> Instructions to his <hi>Legats,</hi> when hmself was present.</p>
            <p>If it were evidently proved, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> then carried away <hi>Timothy</hi> with him to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and so to <hi>Rome,</hi> there would be greater force in the Objection. But how doth that appear? Not from Scripture. For when St. <hi>Paul</hi> appeared at the Temple, the <hi>Jews</hi> laid hold on him, because they supposed <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 21. 29.</note> he had brought <hi>Trophimus</hi> the <hi>Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> with him into the Temple, whom they had seen so much with him in the City. How came <hi>Timothy</hi> not to be as much taken notice of, if he were there? For, he being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> there was far greater Reason for them to have raised a Tumult about <hi>Timothy,</hi> than about <hi>Trophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, we find <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 24. 27.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> kept <hi>two years in Prison,</hi> and not a word of <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:51248:19"/>
whom we may justly suppose exercising his Charge all that time at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> When Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> we find not <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> in his Company; no mention being made of him till he Wrote the <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <note n="p" place="margin">Phil. 1. 1.</note>

            <p>And now let any reasonable Man consider, whether there be not sufficient Proof, that the Apostolical Power of Governing Churches was communicated to others besides the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> themselves; and consequently there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51248:20"/>
might be a Succession in that <hi>Power,</hi> in as many as the <hi>Apostles</hi> thought fit.</p>
            <p>It is confessed by some <note n="z" place="margin">Walo. <hi>Messal. c.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 40. 50. 81.</note> 
               <hi>That there were Secondary Apostles, such as besides Timothy and Titus, Linus, Clemens and Epaphroditus are said to have been; but these are called Itinerant Preachers, and not fixed Bishops.</hi> But the same Persons observe from <note n="a" place="margin">Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret. <hi>in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum.

               <hi>Theodoret,</hi> not onely that these were called <hi>Bishops</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; but <hi>that the Reason why St.</hi> Paul <hi>Wrote Epistles to some, and not to others, was, because some he took with him, and others he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the Government of Churches.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But it is said, <hi>These Secondary Apostles were not sent by Christ, but by the Apostles.</hi> And what then? Would the Apostles betray their <note place="margin">Walo, &amp; <hi>c. p.</hi> 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd if it were not so, then this Power might be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to as many as the Apostles judged convenient; and so (as I said before) we have nothing farther to doe, but to enquire, whether at their removal from particular
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51248:20"/>
Churches, they did not put this Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of others.</p>
            <p>(II. <hi>Consid.)</hi> Whether the <hi>Apostles,</hi> upon their withdrawing, did pass this <hi>Power</hi> over to others, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did plainly in the Case of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> is a matter of Fact; and to be proved in such a manner as such a thing is capable of. We find plainly, the <hi>Apostles</hi> had this Power in themselves, and did convey it to some others; but whether <hi>Universally,</hi> and with a design to continue this Order, must be proved by the best means, we can doe a matter of Fact of so great Antiquity.</p>
            <p>(III. <hi>Consid.)</hi> There can be no stronger Proof of such a matter of Fact, than the general sense of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in the Ages next succeeding the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Now, as to the finding out the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense of the <hi>Church,</hi> as to this matter, I shall premise Three things.</q>
            <p n="1">(1.) It is not necessary to prove from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did observe the same method in all Churches; which we find, as to the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete.</hi> For we have no such particular account, as to the other Churches; but we are certain
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51248:21"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> would doe no irregular thing, nor communicate an Office to others, which was to expire with themselves.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It is not at all necessary, to prove, that all <hi>the Bishops</hi> mention'd in <hi>Scripture</hi> had this <hi>Apostolical Power;</hi> for the contrary appears in the <hi>Bishops</hi> under <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> and therefore the Succession is not to be drawn from the Bishops mentioned in the <hi>Epistles</hi> to them, but from themselves; the want of considering this one Point, hath caused more perplexity in the Controversie about <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> than any one thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) It is not necessary that the <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> in this <hi>Apostolical Power</hi> be made equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear in all <hi>Churches;</hi> since the <hi>Records</hi> of the Church may be more doubtfull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in some Churches which are not in others. But yet there are these ways to make out the general Sense of the Christian Church, as to this point.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the Evidence of the <hi>Succession</hi> is clear in the most conspicuous Churches, by undoubted Testimonies.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That those who seemed most doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full about the first <hi>Succession,</hi> do yield the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51248:21"/>
               <hi>Consent</hi> of the Church in the Practice of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) As to the undoubted Testimonies of this Succession in the most conspicuous Churches; I shall first appeal to <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as least liable to Exception. The former not onely mentions a <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> to the <hi>Apostles;</hi> but he saith, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Qui ab Apostolis ipsis instituti sunt Episcopi in Ecclesiis—quibus etiam ipsas Ecclesias com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittebant—quos &amp; Successores relinquebant, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ipsorum locum Magisterii tradentes.</hi> Iren. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note>

(2.) That those who seem'd most doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full about the <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> doe yield the general consent of the Church in the Practice of it. Some few of the <hi>Ancients</hi> must be allowed to have had <hi>singular Fancies and Opinions</hi> of their own, about this Matter. And the not yielding this, hath been another great Advantage to the Enemies of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
            <p>But, as to those few among the Fathers, who have advanced singular Opinions about the <hi>first Government of Churches,</hi> I desire these things may be observed.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That it is no wonder there should be different Opinions about the Beginnings of things, which are generally very obscure; and therefore thinking Men are apt to frame different <hi>Hypotheses</hi> about them. As about the Original of Civil Government; some founding it in Dominion and Property; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers on Consent of the People; others in a Natural Right of Sovereignty, which one preserves, and the rest part with; others in Primogeniture; and lastly, others most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably in Divine Providence and Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whilst these things lie onely in <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> a difference of Opinions is hard to be prevented, and of no such ill consequence to the World: but if Men, from those <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:51248:23"/>
draw such Inferences as tend to disturb the Peace of the World, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw Men from Obedience to Government; then such Opinions are to be looked on as Dangerous and Seditious, and care must be taken to prevent their spreading. So here, about the Rise of <hi>Episcopal Government,</hi> if the Question were onely a matter of Curiosity, <hi>Whether the Apostles did first try the Experiment of Presbyters governing in common, and upon the inconveniencies of that Government set up Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> seems to think; or, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were at first a Succession in Course,</hi> as another of the Ancients imagin'd, <hi>till the inconveniencies of that made a Choice necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sub Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> Ambros. <hi>in c.</hi> 4. <hi>ad</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</note> If it went no farther than bare <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> though these Opinions may be both false, yet they are not dangerous: But when any from hence infer, the Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be an Usurpation, and that Men are bound to restore the Right of Presbyters in opposition to them, notwithstanding the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Consent of the Church, from the Apostles times; then such Opinions change their Nature, and become mischievous in their Consequences.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It is a great Argument against these singular Opinions, that they contradict each other; and therefore the General Sense of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51248:23"/>
Church is to be prefer'd before them. For St. <hi>Jerome</hi> affirms, <hi>That from St.</hi> Mark<hi>'s time,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hieron. <hi>in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagr. 85.</note> 
               <hi>in the Church of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>the Presbyters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways chose one of their Body, whom they made their Bishop:</hi> So that no such thing could ever be practised there, as <hi>a Succession in Course,</hi> which the other affirms. And as it is the great Advantage of Monarchy, that it had the General Consent of Mankind in the Eldest times; and that those who would set up Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government, differ so much in the First Principles and Fundamentals of it; So it is, as to the Government of the Church by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, that even these who differ about the First Form, yet agree in the early Change, and the Universal Consent in it.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) If St. <hi>Jerome</hi> be understood of the setting up Episcopacy in the <hi>Apostolical Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> after the Apostles times, and a trial then made of Governing by Presbyters, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excused from contradicting himself as well as the rest of the Fathers. For what Experiment was there of that kind in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> if <hi>from St.</hi> Mark<hi>'s time, the Presbyters set up one above themselves, as an Army making choice of a General;</hi> which are his own Expressions? Will any Man say, An Army is Governed by a Council of Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Officers, when they have a General over
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51248:24"/>
them, though of their own choosing? So in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he saith. <hi>St.</hi> James <note place="margin">Hieron. <hi>ad</hi> Gal. 2. &amp; <hi>in Script. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>was the first Bishop;</hi> How was that Church then Governed by <hi>a College of Presbyters?</hi> At <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he confesses <hi>Timothy</hi> was Bishop there; and <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Creet <note place="margin">In Catalog.</note>.</hi> At <hi>Rome</hi> he makes <hi>Linus and Clemens to succeed in the Bishoprick there. At Antioch,</hi> he saith, <hi>Ignatius was Bishop,</hi> and he owns his <hi>Epistles,</hi> and surely there is nothing like the sole Government by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in them. <hi>At Smyrna,</hi> he saith, <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp was appointed Bishop, and had care of the Churches of Asia.</hi> Where then, according to St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> is this <hi>Government by Presbyters</hi> to be found after the <hi>Apostles</hi> times?</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) No Man lays down greater Reasons for the Change of this Government, than St. <hi>Jerome</hi> doth. For he saith, <hi>That Episcopacy was found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>

make St. <hi>Jerome</hi> charge the <hi>Apostles</hi> with <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion</hi> before, in not preventing the first Occasion of Schisms. For he might think, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> would have thought themselves hardly dealt with, to be excluded from Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment till the Experiment were tried, and the Confusions following convinced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Necessity of a Superiour, and so made them more willing to submit. Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> seems to have had the same kind of Notion of <hi>Church Government,</hi> which others have of the beginnings of Civil Government, <hi>viz.</hi> That at first there was a <hi>State of War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Mankind,</hi> and the inconveniencies of that made men willing to part with their own Rights for the sake of Peace; so these <hi>Presbyters,</hi> finding so much Disorder and Confusion, by being left to themselves, were far better contented to yield to such Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as would best keep the Church in Peace.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) St. <hi>Jerome</hi> yields, that this Alteration of Government did <hi>Universally obtain.</hi> For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than that can be meant by his <hi>In to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to orbe decretum est:</hi> He doth not speak clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether he means a Decree of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> to bind the Church, or a General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; but whichsoever be meant, he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses no difference, or opposition about it. If
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51248:25"/>
he had said it was done by the <hi>Apostles</hi> in plain terms, he had taken away the force of his own Argument, which goes upon the <hi>Apostles Times;</hi> but yet it is hard to conceive how such an alteration should happen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Apostles Act.</hi> For, if they had left the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in full Power of Government, it is not to be imagin'd, they would so universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part with it, without being obliged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, by those who had Authority over them; but this St. <hi>Jerome</hi> leaves to be gather'd by the Event.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) St. <hi>Jerome</hi> never supposes this Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have been made against any Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ. All that he saith, is, <hi>That there was a time when the Presbyters were left to themselves, and so did Govern the Church by common Consent. And at that time the Apostles Writing to them suppose a Bishop and Presbyter the same:</hi> but he never saith that Christ had appointed, that none should be set over them. For then there could be no Alteration with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Violation of a Law of Christ, which he could never suppose would so universally obtain without opposition. And he never dreamt the setting up of this Government to be any part of <hi>the Mystery of Iniquity then working;</hi> unless he could imagine the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Peace of the Church to be it. On
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51248:25"/>
the contrary, St. <hi>Jerome</hi> makes this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the very same Places to bear an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy to <hi>Aaron and his Sons, and the Levites in the Temple, to Moses and the LXX. Elders under the Law:</hi> and in other Places out of the heat of Dispute, when the Roman Deacons were not in his head, he <hi>makes the Bishops the</hi>

(IV. <hi>Consid.)</hi> The Universal Consent of the Church being proved, there is as great Reason to believe, the <hi>Apostolical Succession</hi> to be of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institution,</hi> as the <hi>Canon of Scripture,</hi> or the <hi>Observation of the Lord's Day.</hi> We do not doubt but it is unlawfull to add to, or to diminish from the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture;</hi> and yet there is no plain Text for it, with respect to all the Books contained in it, and some of the Books were a long time disputed in some Churches; but the Churches coming at last to a full Agreement in this matter, upon due search and enquiry, hath been thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to bind all after-Ages to make no Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in it. And as to the <hi>Divine Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> we do not go about to lessen it, but onely to shew, that some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in Scripture, being joined with the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in its purest A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, hath been allowed to be sufficient ground not onely for following Ages to observe it, but to look on it as at least an <hi>Apostolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</hi> Now it cannot but seem unequal, not to allow the same force, where there is the same Evidence. And therefore our Church hath wisely and truely determined, <hi>That since the Apostles times there-have been three Orders, of Bishops, Priests and Deacons;</hi> and in a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51248:26"/>
well constituted Church, are to continue to the World's end.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The last thing to be spoken to, is the <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Circumspection</hi> necessary in admitting Persons to the Exercise of this holy Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here mention'd, <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man.</hi> And that will appear very reasonable on these accounts, because the <hi>Welfare</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of <hi>Mens Souls</hi> depend so much upon those who are admitted to holy Orders; and therefore it is not onely <hi>Negligence</hi> and <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,</hi> but <hi>Unfaithfulness</hi> to the <hi>Trust</hi> reposed in them, if through their Fault they suffer unfit Men to take upon them to be the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of holy things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>Welfare</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is so much concerned in it. It is true, some have higher Places, greater Authority, more powerfull In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the State of the Church than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have; but yet every Wheel must be in its due Order and Motion, or the whole may be easily disturbed. A loose, irregular Clergy have so great Influence on the Minds of some People, with respect to the whole Church, that they will never think well of that Church where such Persons are employ'd. For they will not distinguish the Good and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51248:27"/>
Bad, where it is more suitable to their Interest, and Prejudices not to doe it.</p>
            <p>And we find, by too sad Experience, if those who are disaffected to our Church have met with unfit Persons in their Places, though very obscure and remote, what perpetual Clamour they make with it all their Lives after; and what Insinuations are given, that the rest were alike; and this is still pleaded, how unjustly soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as the most popular Argument for Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. So that a Scandalous Clergy-Man doeth unspeakable Mischief, not onely to his own and others Souls, but to the whole Church he owns himself to be of. And very many good Examples do not signifie so much to the Benefit of a Church, as a few bad ones doe to the Mischief of it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> lies at Stake too; which suffers very much, when those who pretend to Teach others the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are seen going themselves, and drawing others into the Broad Way to Destruction. Our Preaching to the People their Duties, doth but make them more narrowly watch and observe our Lives, to see whether we live agreeably to the Directions we give them. And if we slight in our Practice what we Preach in the Pulpit, if we act our selves just contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what we require from them, it will be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51248:27"/>
hardly possible to convince them we are in earnest, and believe any thing of Religion our selves. And how can we imagine they should regard what we say in the Pulpit, if they plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see we regard it not our selves when we are out of it? It was <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s observation long ago; That it is not what Men speak, which moves the People so much, as the Opinion they have of the Person that speaks: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Oratours of old put into the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Fab. Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> of one fit to persuade the People, that he must have <hi>the Reputation of a good Man;</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise all he speaks will be thought onely Art or Design.</p>
            <p>I know no way to have the reputation of a Good Man, like being so: and we are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more concerned to be so, than those, whose great Business was to put false Colours upon things. We speak the Words of Truth and Soberness; let us not then make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple question them, by not finding the due ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of them in our own Conversations. They are very apt to suspect we look on Preaching as our Trade, and mind it no more than <hi>the Silver-smiths did the Shrines</hi> they made for <note place="margin">Act. 19. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Diana,</hi> which they set off to the best advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, not for the Reverence they had for <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> but for the Gain She brought to the Crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. We have no such effectual Way to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51248:28"/>
convince our Auditours, that we mean what we say, as when they find us to be great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples our selves of the Duties we press up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, <hi>viz.</hi> of Devotion, Humility, Charity, Sobriety, Mortification, Contentedness, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abless, and Universal Holiness and when the People <hi>see our Light shining before them, by the good Works we doe,</hi> we shall there by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them <hi>to glorifie God,</hi> to think better of Religion, and to follow our Example.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Mens Souls</hi> depends very much upon the <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of those who are to be their Guides to Heaven. For, if they lead them astray, whom they think they are bound to follow, their destruction will be unavoidable. <hi>When the blind lead the blind, they both fall into the Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch;</hi> but yet the <hi>blind leader</hi> falls first, and falls heaviest and deepest, and the other falls upon him, and sinks him lower. It is a sad thing to have the Guilt of other Mens sins, as well as our own to answer for; when by our Wilfull Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of our known Duty, or by our Examples, or by our Erroneous Doctrine, we prove the Occasion of damning those Souls, which were committed to our Charge to conduct them to Heaven.</p>
            <p>The Care of <hi>Souls</hi> would be a dreadfull thing indeed, if we were to answer for all the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51248:28"/>
Miscarriages of the People committed to our Charge: But if they are such as happen through the voluntary and plain Omission of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty laid upon us; or our being Accessory to their Commission of them, they may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged on our Account.</p>
            <p>With what <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Caution</hi> then ought all Persons to enter upon so weighty, so holy, so tremendous a Charge? What Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mind is necessary to consider it! What <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> to obtain God's Assistence in it! What Wisedom, and Piety, and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to discharge it!</p>
            <p>But let us not be dishearten'd; we serve a Gracious Master, and in the best Employment; and although we may meet with many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, within and without, and on all sides, yet <hi>let us be stedfast, unmoveable, always abou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
