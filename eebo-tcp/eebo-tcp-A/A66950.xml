         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE Author of the Life of this worthy Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop relates, That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst other extraordinary Gifts and Graces, the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had bestowed upon him, he was wonderfully endued with a Prophetick Spirit, whereby
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35266:64"/>
he predicted several things sometime long before they came to pass, whereof some we have seen fulfilled, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers remain yet to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished: and though he was one that abhorr'd En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastick Noti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s, being too Learned, Rational, and Knowing, to admit such idle Freaks and Whimsies: Yet he profest, That seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times in his Life he had many things imprest upon his Mind, concerning future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, with so much warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and importunity, that he was not able to keep them secret, but lay under an un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable necessity to make them known.</p>
            <p>From which Spirit he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the <hi>Irish</hi> Rebellion Forty years before it came, with the time when it should break forth, in a Sermon at <hi>Dublin,</hi> in 1601; where from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35266:64"/>
6. discoursing concerning the Prophets bearing the iniquity of <hi>Judah</hi> forty days, the Lord therein appointed a day for a year: He made this direct Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in relation to the connivance of Popery at that time. <hi>From this year,</hi> says he, <hi>will I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eckon the Sin of</hi> Ireland, <hi>that those whom you now embrace, shall be your ruine, and you shall bear this Iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Prediction proved exactly true; for from that time 1601, to the year 1641, was Forty years, in which it is notoriously known, that the Rebellion and Destruction of <hi>Ireland</hi> happened, which was acted by those Popish Emissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which were then conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at.</p>
            <p>And of this Sermon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop reserved the Notes, and made a Remark of it in the Margent of his Bible; and for 20 years before, he lived
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35266:65"/>
in the expectation of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of it, and the nearer the time was, the more he was confident it was near accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment; though as yet, there was no visible appearance.</p>
            <p>The year before the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion brokeforth, (says Dr. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>) <hi>The Bishop taking his leave of me, being going from</hi> Ireland <hi>to</hi> England, <hi>he advised me to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Preparation; for I should see heavy Sorrows and Miseries before I saw him again;</hi> which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with as great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as if he had seen it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which seems to verifie that of the Prophet, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he will reveal it to his Servants, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this prophetick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he foresaw the Changes and Miseries of <hi>England</hi> in Church and State; for having in one of his Books, (<hi>De Prim. Eccl. Brit.</hi>) given a large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35266:65"/>
of the Destruction of the <hi>Britains,</hi> by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> about 550 years after Christ, he gives this among other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, why he insisted so large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon it; That he foresaw that a like Judgment was yet behind, if timely Repentance and Reformation did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; and he would often mourn upon the foresight of this, long before it came.</p>
            <p>From this Spirit he gave mournfull intimations of the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom he would be often speaking with fear and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, even when the King had the greatest Success; and would therefore constantly pray, and gave all Advice pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to prevent any such thing.</p>
            <p>From this Spirit he foresaw his own Poverty in Worldly things; and this he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten speak of, with admiration
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35266:66"/>
to the Hearers, when he was in his greatest Prosperity, which the event did most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly verifie.</p>
            <p>From this Spirit he predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Divisions and Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>England,</hi> about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the sad Consequences of it; some of which we have seen fulfilled, and I pray God the rest, which he feared, may not also be accomplished.</p>
            <p>Lastly, from this Spirit he foretold, That the greatest stroke upon the Reformed Churches was yet to come; and the time of the utter ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> should be when she thought her self most secure; and to this last, I shall add a brief Account from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's own hand who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.</p>
            <p>The year before the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate's Death, I went to him, and earnestly desired him to grant me in Writing his Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35266:66"/>
of Justification, and Sanctification by Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I had formerly heard him Preach upon those Points, wherein he seemed to make those great Mysteries more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to my mean Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than any Discourse I had heard from others; but by reason I had an imperfect Memory of the particulars, I took the boldness to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune him, That he would please to give me a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them in writing, whereby I might the better imprint them in my memory; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which he would willingly have excused himself, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, his Intentions of not writing any more; adding, That if he did write any thing, it should not exceed a sheet or two: but upon my continued importunity, I at last obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his promise.</p>
            <p>He coming to Town some
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35266:67"/>
time after, was pleased to give me a Visit; where I fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to challenge the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his promise made to me; to which he replyed, <q>That he had not writ, and yet could not charge himself with any breach of promise; for (said he) I did begin to write, but when I came to write of Sanctification, that is, of the new Creature, which God formeth by his Spirit in every Soul, which he doth truly regenerate, I found so little of it wrought in my self, that I could speak of it only as Parrots by rote, and without the knowledge and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what I might have exprest; and therefore I durst not presume to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any farther upon it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When I seemed to stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd to hear such an humble Confession, from so great and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35266:67"/>
experienced a Christian. He added:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I must tell you, we do not well understand what San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and the New Creature are; it is no less, than for a Man to be brought to an entire resignation of his Will to the Will of God, and to live in the offering up of his Soul, continually in the flames of love, as a whole Burnt-offering to Christ, and how little (says he) are many of those who profess Christianity experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally acquainted with this Work on their Souls.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By this Discourse, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he had very excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly discovered to me that part of Sanctification, which he was unwilling to write.</p>
            <p>I then presumed to enquire of him, what his present ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions were, concerning
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35266:68"/>
a great Persecution which should fall upon the Church of God in these Nations of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which this reverend Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate had spoken many years before, when we were in Peace and Settlement.</p>
            <p>I ask'd him whether he did believe those sad times were past, or to come, he told me, <q>They were to come, and that he did as fully expect it, as ever he had done: <hi>adding,</hi> That this sad Persecution would fall upon all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches in <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <hi>I replyed,</hi> I hoped it might be past, as to these Nations of ours, since I thought, that though we have been punished much less than our Sins have deserved, and that our late Wars have made far less de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastations, than War common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brings where it pleaseth God in Judgment to suffer it;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35266:68"/>
yet we must needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that many great Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses have been burnt, ruined, and left without Inhabitants; many great Families impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithed and undone, and many thousand lives also had been lost in that bloudy War, and that <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as <hi>England,</hi> had drunk ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deep of the Cup of God's Anger, even to the overthrow of the Government, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Desolation almost of a very great part of those Countries.</p>
            <p>But this holy Man turning to me, and fixing his eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me with that serious and irefull look which he usually had, when he spoke God's Word, and not his own; and when the Power of God seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be upon him, and to constrain him to speak, which I could easily discern much to differ from the Countenance wherewith he usually spake to me. He said thus:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35266:69"/>
               <q>Fool not your self with such hopes; for I tell you, all you have yet seen, hath been but the beginning of Sorrows, to what is yet to come upon the Protestant Churches of Christ, who will e'er long fall under a sharper Persecution than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet has upon them; and therefore (<hi>said he to me</hi>) look you be not found in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court, but a worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Temple before the Altar, for Christ will mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure all those that profess his Name, and call themselves his People; and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Worshippers he will leave out, to be trodden down by the Gentiles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The outward Court (<hi>says he</hi>) is the formal Christian, whose Religion lies in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the out-side Duties of Christianity, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an inward life and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35266:69"/>
of Faith, and Love, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to Christ, and these God will leave to be trodden down and swept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Gentiles; but the Worshippers within the Temple, and before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, are those who do indeed Worship God in Spirit and in Truth, whose Souls are made his Temples, and he is honoured and adored in the most inward Thoughts of their Hearts, and they sacrifice their Lusts and vile Affections, yea, and their own Wills to him; and these God will hide in the hollow of his hand, and under the shadow of his Wings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And this shall be one great difference between this last, and all the other preceeding Persecutions; for in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the most eminent and spiritual Ministers, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians did generally suffer

            <p>All this he spake with so great assurance, and with the same serious and concerned Countenance, which I have before observed him to have, when I have heard him fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel some things which in all humane appearance were very unlikely to come to pass, which yet I my self have lived to see happen according to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: and this made me give the more earnest attention to what he then uttered.</p>
            <p>He then added, That the Papists were in his opinion the <hi>Gentiles</hi> spoken of in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of the <hi>Revelations;</hi> to

            <p>This was the substance, and I think (for the greatest part) the very same words which this holy Man spake to me, not long before his death, and which I writ down, that so great and notable a Prediction might not be lost by my self or others.</p>

            <p>THE Context runs thus, <hi>And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye Inhabitants of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and thou King Jehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat: Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid, nor dismaied</hi>

               <hi>by reason of this great multitude; for the Battel is not yours, but God's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the words of God, which he commanded <hi>Jahaziel</hi> the Prophet to deliver to <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat</hi> King of <hi>Judah.</hi> When the <hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> came to make War against him, to dispossess him of his Kingdom, verse the 8th of this Chapter, and may be a seasonable Text for this Auditory.</p>
            <p>Our Sins indeed are many, which have justly provoked God's heavy Wrath against us: and our Enemies are very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous which surround us, therefore now let us cry mightily unto God, earnestly beseeching him, that he would pardon all our Sins, blot out all our Iniquities, and receive us graciously; let us sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent and be heartily sorry for our manifold Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions committed against him, so shall we by his Divine Assistance
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:35266:84"/>
be in a readiness to encounter with <hi>Roman</hi> Malice, these <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> and <hi>Ammonites,</hi> who are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to our Lives, Religion, Laws, and Liberties; and be animated with Courage to go out cheerfully against <hi>Rome</hi>'s Force and Cruelties, fighting manfully the Lord's Battel, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of us, laying his hand upon his Heart, with this comfortable Expression in our Mouths, <hi>Be not afraid, nor dismaied by reason of this great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for the Battel is not ours, but God's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Servile Fear is the harbin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Guilty, and a slavish timorousness belongs not to the Strong and Couragious, but a God like Fear attends upon the Vertuous, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Success in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. Holy <hi>Job</hi> that great Proficient in God's School, and great Example of Christian Patience tells you, <hi>Job</hi> 28. 28.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35266:85"/>
               <hi>The fear of the Lord, that is Wisdom; and to depart from Evil is Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi> This is the only su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Good and Fear, which secures us from committing, shameful Acts, and creates a circumspection in our Lives; for as the shadow of the Body is followed by the Sun, so doth Glory attend Vertue in our progress to Christ. Let us then put our whole trust in God, in this time of danger, and take the Royal Prophets resolution, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 6. <hi>Not to fear what man can do unto us;</hi> but rather fear the Lord, who <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth those that fear him,</hi> Psal. 103. 13.</p>
            <p>It is the Duty of every one of us to be circumspect in our Lives, but more especially at this season and time of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the hand of God is stretched out against us; when the Enemy waits even at our doors ready to devour us, when
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:35266:85"/>
they stand gaping ready to swallow us up quick, and none of us can prognosticate how soon his Life may be lost, or be in danger; therefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to lay hold on that Advice which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> Ephes. 6. 10, 11. <hi>Be ye strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might. Put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to stand.</hi> So shall we be fortified with that Courage which is mentioned here in my Text, of being <hi>not afraid, or dismaied by reason of this great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, for the Battel is not ours, but God's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be not afraid, or dismaied by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this great multitude,</hi> is the Command of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand let us humbly obey his Divine Order, and valiantly fight under his Protection. A multitude there is, and very great; what then, <hi>the Battel is</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:35266:86"/>
               <hi>God's,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; he is also to be feared above all Gods.</hi> The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude here in my Text were <hi>Moabites,</hi> and <hi>Ammonites;</hi> but the multitude which layeth close Siege to us, are <hi>Jesuits</hi> and bloudy <hi>Papists,</hi> whose damnable Principles, and hellish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are to quench the light of the Gospel, to root and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all Christianity, who blasphemously think to gain Heaven by Massacring God' People, and triumph in the effussion of shedding innocent Bloud: it is their Glory to lay Kingdoms wast, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tries desolate, reduce Cities to Ashes, and ruine Families those which will not fall down to worship their Idols, false Gods of Wood and Stone, are fit objects of their Fury; their Cruelty is beyond what Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice can invent, or Hell ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:35266:86"/>
and <hi>Solomon</hi> gives a true Character of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 4. <hi>Wrath is cruel, and Anger is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious; but who is able to stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Envy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But God will pour out his Wrath upon them, and shoot at them with his Arrows, that they shall be wounded, his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance will speedily overtake, and drown them, like harden'd <hi>Pharaob</hi> in the red Sea of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; let him who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God to Anger, lay his hand on his Heart, and now say with <hi>Nehemiah, Shall such an one as I flie? Shall I whom God hath honoured so much, dishonour him by Oaths so greatly? who am placed in an higher Sphere than others, be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a dim or a wandering Star? Shall I who am most obliged to God by the Bonds of Wealth and Power, exceed the bounds of Truth and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice? whom he hath made a Ruler of the People, not rule my self and my own Kingdoms according to his Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:35266:87"/>
               <hi>Rule? God forbid.</hi> God will not permit their Romish poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to overthrow our Christian Piety, he will not suffer them to <hi>break the bruised Reed of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, nor quench the smoaking Flax of their Necessities, he will be a Lamp unto our Feet, and a Light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Path in this Extremity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be not afraid, or dismaied by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this great multitude,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We must every one of us look upon this great Affliction as sent from God, for he knows what is better for us, than we do for our selves; and that which seems most evil at present, may turn at last to our greatest benefit. None of us ought to despair of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for when our weak Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of God are such as drive us from him, we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the main end of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is to bring God, and our selves nearer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. None ought to exclude
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:35266:87"/>
themselves from God's Mercy, whom he excludes not from it; and God excludes none, whom he invites to repent, with a promise of forgiveness, if they do it: and the goodness and long suffering, and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of us Sinners, is on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose design'd to lead us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; so that after all this, to despair, and fail in our Courage, is only to reject the Mercy which God offers, but to question his truth and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, to slight his Patience, to disparage his Goodness, and to look upon him as a most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful and implacable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is to admit and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain most dishonourable and unworthy Thoughts of the Best, the Wisest, the most merciful and compassionate Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the World, who hath proclaim'd himself, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. <hi>To be a God merciful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, long-suffering, and abundant</hi>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:35266:88"/>
               <hi>in Goodness and Truth, keeping Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for thousands, for giving Iniquity, Transgresson, and Sin;</hi> that is, to all that truly repent: So that when we consider, we have no reason to despair of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to us, but readily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to obey his Command, and not shrink from those prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which prompt us to his Honour and Glory, in whose Service is perfect freedom; but to rouse up our selves like Men, stand upon our Guard, fortifie our selves and be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, not being <hi>afraid, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied by reason of this great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;</hi> for it is God's cause which we fight for, and our Lives cannot be better imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than in his Service, from whom we received all we have, or can pretend to; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us press forwards in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Command, <hi>for the Battel is not yours, but God's.</hi>
