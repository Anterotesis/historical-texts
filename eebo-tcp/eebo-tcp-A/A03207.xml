            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Remembring the French Prouerbe,

            </p>
            <p>I haue exposed my selfe a subiect to all censures, and entreat the Reader not to vndertake me with any sinister prejudice. For my hope is, if he shall fairely trace me in that modest and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full course which I haue trauelled, he may say in the conclusion, <hi>Facilius currentibus, quam repentibus lapsus.</hi> For I professe my selfe to be so free from all arrogance and ostent, that, <hi>Vt caveam timen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, tuta pertimesco.</hi> My <hi>Iuvenilia</hi> I must confesse were sutable to my age then, for being a childe, I spake as a childe; but Maruritie hath since better instructed me: remembring that excellent Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Sophocles, Si Iuvenis luxuriat, peccat; si senex, insanit.</hi> Nor forgetting that of <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philosopher, <hi>Ante senectutem curan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, benè vivere; in senectute, benè mori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I haue proposed vnto you Good Angels and Bad; the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the one, still continuing in their created Puritie; the refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie rebellion of the other, damning themselues to all eternity. In the reading of which, I entreat you to take into your conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that wholesome obseruation of Saint <hi>Chrisostome, Natura rerum sic est, vt quoties bonus malo conjungitur, non ex bono malus melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur,
<pb facs="tcp:23208:4"/>
sed ex malo bonus contaminetur, sic vnum pomum malum facilè centum bonos corrumpti; at centum mala nunquam vnum corruptum efficiunt bonum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, to expect any new conceits from old heads, is as if a man should looke for greene fruit from withered branches. But as <hi>Time</hi> the producter of all things, though he be aged himselfe, is euery houre begetting somthing new; sowe, on whose heads he hath cast such a snow, as no radicall or naturall heate can melt, in imitation of him, (who as sure as he knowes vs borne, will as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prouide vs buriall) will neuer suffer our braines to leaue working, till our pulses cease beating. But howsoeuer the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our working be, so the matter which is wrought vpon be worthy, the value of the subiect dignifieth the invaliditie of the Vndertaker. And thus I take my leaue of thee with this gentle admonition,

For the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Idols was the beginning of whoredome; and the finding of them is the corruption of life: for they were not from the beginning, neither shall they continue for euer; the vain-glory of men brought them into the world, therefore they shall come shortly to an end. When a Father mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned grieuously for his Sonne that was taken away suddenly, hee made an Image for him, that was once dead, whom now hee worshippeth as a god, and ordained to his seruants ceremonies and sacrifices.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The opinion of the <hi>Vadiani</hi> concerning God.</note>
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writeth, That the <hi>Vadiadni,</hi> who were after called <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropomarphitae,</hi> were of opinion. That God had a body, and was therefore visible. Now the maine reason vpon which they groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this error, was, because they trusted more to the outward sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, than to the inward Intellect; bringing their authoritie from <hi>Genesis,</hi> wherein they had read, That the first man <hi>Adam</hi> did sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of soule and body, according to Gods owne Image. As also from many other Texts of Scripture,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. <hi>Esay</hi> 25. &amp;c.</note> in which the like members and attributes belonging to man, are ascribed vnto God. But this Heresie, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> witnesseth, was vtterly reiected and condemned: for if God were circumscribed or included in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body, He must then necessarily be finite, and therefore not present in all places at once, which takes away his Vbiquitie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he should be compounded of matter and forme, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore subiect vnto accidents: all which being the Characters of Imperfection, are no way liable to the Sempiternall, Immortall, Omnipotent, Inuisible, and the most consummate and absolute Deitie.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad Ephes.</hi>
                  </note> Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes this acclamation: Blessed is the sole-Potent, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who hath Immortalitie, and whose dwelling is in inaccessible Light, whom no man euer saw, or can see, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reason why, as well members belonging to mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as the affections and passions of the minde, are in diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the holy Scripture conferred vpon God (as to reioyce, to be angry, &amp;c.) is not because he is composed of outward linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and framed or fashioned as man; or that he is truly angred, or pleased, doth walke, ascend, descend, or the like; but that the Holy-Ghost doth accommodate him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elfe to the imbecilitie and weakenesse of our shallow capacities and vnderstandings, that we may be more capable of the power, wisedome, and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible workes of the Almightie. Therefore, saith Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> is God said to be angry, to denote vnto vs the filthinesse and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination of our sinnes and offences; in his booke entituled, Of <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke. His words be these: God is not angry, as mutable; but he is said to be so, that the bitternesse of our transgressions, by which we iustly incur his Diuine incensement, might thereby be made more familiar and terrible: as if our sinnes (which are so grieuous and heinous in his sight) caused that He who in his own nature is neither moued to wrath or hate, or passion, might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to anger.</p>
               <p>Of the same opinion is <hi>Eutherius:</hi> In what place soeuer (saith he) the sacred Scriptures either ascribe the passions of the minde,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:23208:53"/>
or any distinct part of the body, to the Almighty, as Head, Hand, Foot, Eare, Eye, or the like; or other motions of the soule, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Fauour, Forgetfulnesse, Remembrance, Repentance, &amp;c. they are not to be vnderstood carnally, according to the bare letter of the Text: but all things concerning him are spiritually to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; and therefore we are not to beleeue, that God hath at any time been visible to our fore-fathers, as he is to the blessed Saints and Angels, though in many places of the sacred Scriptures hee is said to appeare vnto them (as, to our first father <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, when he spake to him these words, <hi>Encrease and multtply:</hi> Or when he reproued him for eating of the forbidden Tree, &amp;c. Nor when he spake vnto <hi>Noah,</hi> and commanded him to build the Ark. Nor when he promised vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> the Patriarch, That in his Seed all the Nations of the earth should be blessed. Nor when he often spake to the great Prophet <hi>Moses,</hi> in the Bush, in mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, and elsewhere) but it is receiued for a truth, that those forms by which God either appeared, or was heard to speake, was by the seruice and ministerie of his holy Angels; as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> most learnedly disputeth in his third and fourth booke <hi>De Trinitate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Hieronimus Cardanus,</hi> a man of most excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and judgement, in his booke entituled, <hi>De Deo &amp; Vniuerso, i.</hi> Of God and the World; after he hath by many probable reasons and approued testimonies proued, That God by no humane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding was to be comprehended; onely that he was a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cause, one onely God,<note place="margin">Attributes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to God.</note> the Originall, Fountaine, and Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all things, the sole Immensenesse and soueraigne Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; contemplating nothing but Himselfe; of such Light, that hee is onely himselfe capable, of such claritie and brightnesse, that he beholdeth either Hemisphere at once, as well the remote as the neerest regions of heauen and earth; Immouable, no way obnoxious to varietie or change; of such splendor, that mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie cannot abide or endure his sight or presence; of a most subtile essence, alwaies resting. When this and much more he had dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of His Inscrutabilitie and incomprehensible Deitie, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth his disputation in these words <hi>Quaeris ergo quid Deus sit? si scirem, Deus essem: nam Deum nemo; novit, nec quid sit quisquam scit, nisi solus Deus. i.</hi> Do'st thou therefore demand what God is? If I did know, or were able to resolue thee, I should be a god too; for no man knoweth God, or what he is can any man tel, but God onely. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>One <hi>Scotus,</hi> of a most fluent wit and an acute vnderstanding, hath searcht, endeauoured, and excust euen almost all things, to finde out some name or Character, in which might be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended or contained what God was, as, Wisedome, Goodnesse, Iustice, Mercy, Truth, and the like, at length hee contrudes all those seuerall attributes within the narrow limit of two bare words, namely <hi>Ens Infinitum:</hi> as if it were the most absolute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction that Imagination could beget.

                  <hi>Nisan</hi> is March with vs: And <hi>Vincentius</hi> in his first Chapter of the Historicall Myrrhor saith, That the Hebrewes began their yeare in March, because in that moneth was the AEquinoctial, when the World was created. This opinion was also approued by some Naturalists; as amongst others, <hi>Elpacus,</hi> in his Historicall Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate; who affirmeth, that the Chaldaeans being great Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, were confident, That the first day of the Creation, the Sunne entred into the first point or degree of <hi>Aries.</hi>

               <l>It likewise is coniectur'd by the best</l>
               <l>Of all that haue Astrologie profest,</l>
               <l>Both Iewes and Christian Authors, That the Sun</l>

               </l>
               <l>Another reason's giuen: For the same day</l>

The Ship-wright that maketh a ship, doth not spend all that labour and art, that it may onely be called a Ship; but his intent is to make it fit for nauigation. So he that models or fashions any Cup or Vessell, doth not doe it onely to the end that it shall retain the name of such a thing; but to be imployed

in those necessarie vses for which the like things are framed. So of all other things, there is nothing made for shew only, but some seruice.

Moone, and the rest of the Planets; others, to haue no illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from any Star or Coelestial body: and others againe, to haue the benefit and vse of far more of these heauenly Lights than we in this inferior world enioy. Moreouer, that some of these worlds daily encrease and grow greater; others of the contrary are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to contraction and diminution: of which, sundry of them are quite destitute of Plants, Creatures, and Inhabitants, &amp;c. But which appeares most childish and ridiculous to all that are appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensiue of any humane reason; they maintaine, That these worlds by mutuall wearing and ruine (according to our plaine English Phrase) fall foule one vpon another, and are interchangeably shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and broken life so many glasses or earthen vessells. <hi>Metrodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was of such madnesse,<note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Metrodor.</hi>
                  </note> that hee blushed not to attest, That it was as preposterous to all true Iudgements to thinke, that in so infinite a <hi>Vacuum</hi> there should be but one world; as in a large and spatious field there to be but one spike or blade of grasse. But these delirements and imaginarie Chimaera's haue been opposed by the better experienced Sophists; as <hi>Pythagoras Samius, Thales Milesius, Anaxagoras, Anaximander, Melissus, Heraclitus, Zeno Citicus,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is more amply expressed by <hi>Aristotle</hi> the Prince of Philosophers.

                     <hi>Metaph.</hi> 12.28.</note> according to <hi>Aristotle</hi>: The World (saith hee) is that in which all things are contained, and without which there is nothing that is or can be found.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aristotles</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the World.</note> So by consequence, if there were any thing without the world, then the world could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all things, and therefore no world. But to omit as many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments (and those too, vnanswerable) as would swell this single leaued Pagin into a many-sheeted Volume; in these few words this question may be fully determined. There is but one world, and that perfect; as there is but one most perfect Creator, the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Prince and Gouernor thereof: without which world there is neither Place, Vacuitie, nor Time. Place there is not, because there can be no Place without a Body: if there be no Body? then no Motion: if no Motion? all Time is excluded: <hi>Nam Tempus est mensura motus: i.</hi> For Time is the measure of all motion. Let vs leaue then these wrangling and selfe-opinioned Sophists to their errors and for our own satisfaction (as an vnfailing refuge) sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie our selues in that which the Holy-Ghost speaketh by the mouth of <hi>Moses; In principio creavit Deus coelum &amp; terram:</hi> In the beginning God created the heauens and the earth,<note place="margin">

                  <l>Therefore the <hi>Thrones</hi> haue the third place assign'd.</l>

In which Power ascribed vnto <hi>Iupiter,</hi> as acknowledging one su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Deitie; what doth hee lesse, than sleight and vilifie the weakenesse and deficiencie of all such Idols on whom Diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors are superstitiously conferred?</p>
               <p>I began the former Tractate with the Hierarchie of Angells, their three Classes or Ternions, their order and concatination; in
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:23208:115"/>
which I haue proceeded with that plainenesse, that I hope they need no further demonstration. As also of the opinion of the Sadduces and others, who will allow no Spirits or Angells at all; their weake and vnmomentary Tenents being with much facility remoued. I now proceed to this vnresistable conclusion, That the obiect and end of Gods diuine Will in the creation of all things,<note place="margin">The object of Gods will in the Creation.</note> was no other, than his Grace and Goodnesse, in which he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from all eternitie, and so he might haue done, without the helpe, seruice, or ministerie of any Angell or Creature whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which neither to the ornament, conseruation, or augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Diuine Nature, can adde or detract. And that his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightinesse</hi> was pleased to vndergo this great Worke of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, it was his free-Will, and no Necessitie, that obliged him vnto it. And he that in his Diuine Wisdom and Goodnesse had Will to make things, hath the same Power to dispose them, by which he created them; and as much do we owe vnto him, for the Dangers from which he deliuereth vs, as for the Health, Wealth, and Dignities with which hee blesseth vs. For as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith. The treasures of Vices in vs, are the aboundance of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Angels were the first Creatures God made, created pure as the Light, ordained with the Light to serue God, who is the Lord of Light: They haue charge to conduct vs, wisedome to instruct vs, and grace to preserue vs: They are the Saints Tutors, Heauens Heraulds, and the Bodies and Soules Guardians. Furthermore as <hi>Origen</hi> saith, Euery ones Angell that hath guided him in this life, shall at the last day produce and bring his Charge forth whom he hath gouerned. They at all times and in all places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the majestie of the Heauenly Father. And according to Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> they were created Immortall, Beautifull, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Good, Free, and Subtile, resembling a far off the Essence of God himselfe.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Basil</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Homil sup. Psal.</hi> 44.</note> The Angels suffer no mutation or change, for amongst them there is neither Childe, Youth, nor Old man; but in the same state they were created in the beginning, they stil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, and so vnchangeably shall to all eternitie. And Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> in his Booke <hi>De vera Religione,</hi> vseth these words: Let not the worship of men that be dead be any Religion vnto vs; who if they liued piously, and died good men, desire no such honor to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vpon them: but they desire that Hee onely should be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by vs, by whose illumination, they reioyce, that wee shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come partakers of their blessednesse. Therefore they are to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored for imitation, but not worshipped for Religion. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, speaking of the Augels, he addeth this: We honour them in
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23208:116"/>
our Charitie, but not in any Seruilitie; neither do wee build any Temples vnto them. For they would not be so honoured of vs, knowing that we our selues, if we be good men, are the Temples of the euer liuing God. For our instruction therefore it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, That the Angell forbad man to bow to him, but to giue all worship and reuerence to that Great God, to whom he with him was a fellow seruant.</p>
               <p>God vseth their ministerie and seruice not only to the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his owne glory,<note place="margin">The Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Angels.</note> (as <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. <hi>vers.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>Praise the Lord ye his Angels that excell in strength, that do his commandement in obeying the voice of his Word.

               <p>Of their seuerall apparitions and sundry employments much more might be said, but these few may serue to illustrate the rest. Yet notwithstanding, that great is their power and excellence, and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:23208:116"/>
that God vseth their ministerie in preseruing and protecting vs, and bestowing many benefits and blessings vpon vs; yet as wel by their owne saying, as the sentence of the Apostles, it is manifest, no Diuine Worship is to be conferred vpon them, but vpon God onely.</p>
               <p>Before I come by seuerall histories to enlarge that argument handled in the premisses; namely, That euen by Dreames it may be concluded that there be Spirits.

But to the felicitie or infelicitie of Man it is not so much auaileable, what you suffer in your sleepe, as that which you do being awake: for what euill you then commit, you are to feare the wrath and anger of the gods, and some sad punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ensuing; but for the other not.</p>

Something alluding to that <hi>Homericall</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Dreames: Of which (saith he) those which fly in at the Horny port are true; but those which enter at the Ivorie gate are false.

                     <hi>Eudemus</hi> his Dreame.</note> I come to History. <hi>Aristotle</hi> writeth of one <hi>Eude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> of Cyprus, his familiar friend; who trauelling to Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, came to the noble City Phaecas in Thessaly, then groaning vnder the immanitie of the barbarous Tyrant <hi>Alexander.</hi> In which place falling sicke, and being forsaken of all the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as one desperat of recouerie, a yong man appeared vnto him in a vision; who told him. That in a short space hee should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to his former health. Next, That within a few dayes the Tyrant should be remoued by death. And lastly, That at the end of fiue yeares he himselfe should returne home into his country. The two first predictions happened accordingly; he being resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his former strength, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Tyrant perishing, being slaine by the brothers of his wife. But in the fifth yeare, when (encouraged by his vision) he had hope to returne from Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilie into Cyprus, he was ingaged by the way in a battell fought against the Syracusians, and slaine. His Vision therefore was thus interpreted; That when the Soule of <hi>Eudemus</hi> was departed from his body, it was said to returne againe into it's owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or into his hands againe who first leant it.</p>

Notwithstanding which, in the predicted yeare, at the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and pompous celebration of his Sisters mariage with the young King of Spaine; after hee had three dayes together with great successe and generall applause demeaned himselfe in those Chiualrous exercises of Tilt and Barriers: though hee was much persuaded by the Queene, and entreated by the Lords, after the breaking of many staues, to giue ouer, yet nothing could preuaile with him: insomuch that in the very later end of the day, when most of the Spectators were risen and departed out of the Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, he called to the Count <hi>Montgomerie,</hi> Captain of his Guard, earnestly importuning that he would runne one course more with him. Which when hee sought by all meanes possible to excuse, pretending many vnwilling delayes; he tooke a speare and thrust it into his hand, compelling him to another encounter: in which he was most vnfortunately slaine by a splinter of the staffe, that entring at the sight of his beauer, pierced his braine, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the great solemnitie with his owne lamentable Tragedie. Before this accident happened, in the beginning of the triumph, one <hi>Nostrodanus</hi> told vnto diuers of the Kings seruants in secret, that the King would be in great danger of death before the Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament was fully finished. And (which is most remarkable) a Merchants sonne of Paris, a childe of about six yeares old, not fully seuen, being brought thither that day by his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to see the Tilting; at euery course the King ranne, hee was heard to cry out aloud, They will kill the King, ô they will kill the King.</p>

                  <hi>Plato</hi> was of opinion, That children are no sooner born, but they haue one of those Spirits to attend them, which doth first copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and conioyne the soule vnto the body: and after being grown vnto some maturitie, teach, instruct, and gouerne them. The Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demiques held,<note place="margin">The Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miques.</note> That Spirits behold all mens actions, and assist them; that they know all our apprehensions and cogitations; and when the Soule is deliuered from the Body, they bring it before the high Iudge. That they are questioned about our good or bad actions, their testimonie being much preualent either to excuse or aggrauate. That also they are vigilant ouer vs, either sicke or in health, waking or sleeping, and especially in the very article and point of death, oftentimes inspiring the parting Soule with a diuination surpassing all humane knowledge. For instance:</p>

                  </note> That not one onely, but many Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or <hi>Genij</hi> had the charge of one and euery man: one hauing care ouer his health, another indulgent ouer his beauty and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; another to infuse into him courage and constancie, &amp;c.

               <p>Some haue affirmed Spirits to be of diuers qualities, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to worke in men, according to their owne dispositions, diuers effects. Affirming, That those AEthereall or Fierie, stirre vp men to contemplation: the Airy, to the businesse and common affaires of this life: the Waterie, to pleasure: the Earthy, to base and gripple auarice. So likewise the Martiall Spirits incite vs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; the Ioviall, to prudence; the Venereall, to lust; the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall, to policie and wisedome; the Lunarie, to fertilitie and plenty of issue; the Saturnine, to dissuade from all things that be euill. Such was that <hi>Socraticum Daemonium,</hi>

Of this <hi>Daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> strange things are reported in Historie; as that it was euer at his elbow to diuert him from doing euill, and to aduise him to shun and auoid danger; to remember him of things past, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine vnto him things present, and reueale vnto him things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Socrates</hi> himselfe confessed that hee saw it sometimes, but seldome, yet heard it often.</p>

                  </note> from going to the Groues of Nemaea, and to excuse himselfe from that journey: who despising his counsell, perished in the aduenture.

For which fact being condemned and led to death, he confessed vnto his brother <hi>Clitimachus,</hi> That if he had been swayed by the double aduertisement of <hi>Socrates,</hi> hee had not vndergone so sad a disaster.</p>
               <p>The same <hi>Socrates</hi> in a great defeate which the Athenians had,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:23208:121"/>
flying from the victorious Enemie with <hi>Lachetes</hi> the Praetor, and comming to a place where three wayes met, he chose one path to himselfe, contrarie to the aduice and counsell of all the rest: And being demanded the reason wherefore he did so? he made answer, That his Genius so persuaded him. Which they deriding, tooke a contrarie course, and left him abandoned to himselfe. Now when the Horsemen of the Enemie made hot pursuit after them, they tooke that path which <hi>Lachetes</hi> and all his people had taken; who were all put to the sword, and onely those few which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Socrates,</hi> escaped. He presaged the great strage and messacre which after hapned in Sicilia. As also of the deaths of <hi>Neon</hi> and <hi>Thrasillus,</hi> in their Expedition against those of Ionia and Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke <hi>De Cognitione verae vitae,</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, That Spirits by Gods permission can raise stormes and tempests, and command raine, haile, snow, thunder, and lightning at their pleasures. As also, That by the instigation of Spirits, wild Beasts become either rebellious or seruiceable to mans vse. In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place hee ascribeth the operation of all things, seasonable or vnseasonable, vnto them, but not as Authors and Makers, but Ministers and Seruants to the Diuine Will and command. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording with that in <hi>Ecclesiasticus, Cap.</hi> 39. <hi>vers.</hi> 28. <hi>There be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that are created for vengeance, which in their rigour lay on sure strokes: in the time of destruction they shew forth their power, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the wrath of him that made them. Fire, Haile, Famine, and Death, all these are created for vengeance; the teeth of the wilde Beasts and the Scorpions, and the Serpents, and the Sword, execute vengeance for the destruction of the Wicked. They shall be glad to do his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and when need is they shall be ready vpon earth; and when their houre is come, they shall not ouerpasse the commandements, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this strict rule of Gods commandement both the good and bad Spirits are limited, and beyond that they haue power or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to do nothing. Otherwise, those that are malignant &amp; euill, would in their rabies and fury destroy all Gods creatures in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <note place="margin">Strange opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirits.</note>Rabbi <hi>Avot Nathan</hi> a learned Iew, affirmeth, That Spirits haue three things common with men, namely, Procreation, Food, and Death. <hi>Porphirius</hi> (as <hi>Proclus</hi> witnesseth of him) held all Spirits to be mortall; and that he amongst them who was the longest li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, did not exceed the number of a thousand yeares. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:23208:121"/>
his booke <hi>De Oraculorum defectu,</hi> reciteth a story, That about the Islands called Echinades, newes was brought to one <hi>Thamus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a ship boord, that god <hi>Pan</hi> was dead: and this happened iust at the birth of our Sauiour Christ. But because I haue made vse of this Historie heretofore, in a booke commonly entituled, The <hi>History of Women</hi>; to insert the same here likewise, might be tasted as <hi>Cibus bis coctus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to answer that learned Rabbi, and <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> like him opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated: Not possible it is, That Spirits, created by God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall and incorporeall, should be any way obnoxious to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or death. More credible it is, that these were meere phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies and illusions of the Diuell; by such prestigious sorceries persuading vs that Spirits are mortall; to make man distrust the immorralitie of the Soule, and so possesse him with an heresie grosse, impious, and damnable.</p>
               <p>Here likewise a most necessarie consideration may be inserted,<note place="margin">The Sadduces answered.</note> to giue answer to the Sadduces and others, who obstinately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, That <hi>Moses</hi> in his Booke of the Creation made no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all of Spirits or Angels. When as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to them in beleefe) saith, That vnder the words of <hi>Heauen,</hi> aud <hi>Light</hi> (though not by their proper and peculiar names) they were specified and intended. And that <hi>Moses,</hi> writing to a People whose obstinacie and stupidity was such, that they were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their incorporeall Essence; he was the more chary to giue them plaine and manifest expression. Moreouer, it may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, That if the discreet Law-giuer had told them of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature, it might haue opened a wide gap to their idolatry, to which he knew they were too prone of themselues. For if they were so easily induced to worship a golden Calfe and a brasen Serpent, both of them molten and made with hands; how could so excellent and diuine a Nature haue escaped their adoration. Yet doe the words of <hi>Moses</hi> allow of Spirits, (though couertly) where it is said, <hi>Genes.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Now the Serpent was more subtill than any Beast of the field which the Lord God had made, &amp;c.</hi> By whom was meant the Diuell; as appears, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 2.24. <hi>As Satan can change him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into an Angell of light, so did he vse the wisedome of the Serpent to abuse Man, &amp;c.</hi> I had occasion to speake in my discourse of Dreames, of the one brother, Sleepe: something shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to be discoursed of the other, Death; and to amplifie that in the Prose, which in the Verse was onely mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth Death,<note place="margin">Of Death.</note> the yonger brother of Sleepe; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing that cannot be auoided, it ought therefore the lesse to be feated. One demanding of a noble Sea Captaine, Why, hauing meanes sufficient to liue on land, hee would endanger his

person to the perills and frequent casualties of the Ocean? Hee answered, That hee had a naturall inclination to it, and therefore no persuasion could diuert him from it. The other replied vpon him, I pray where died your Father? he answered, At Sea. Again he asked him, Where his Grandfather died? Who told him, At sea. And are not you then (said he) sor that cause afraid to go to sea? The Captaine made answer; Before I resolue you fully of your demand, let me also be satisfied in one thing from you? I pray you where died your father? He answered, In his bed. And where (saith he) died your Grandfather? Hee likewise answered, In his bed. He then replied, Why are you not then for that cause onely, afraid to go to bed?</p>
               <p>It is a true saying, No man dieth more willingly, than such as haue liued most honestly.

               <p>It is a great and weighty thing, (saith the Philosopher) and not soone learned, When that inevitable houre shall come, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine it with patience: Thou canst not fly the necessitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ouercome it thou maist; namely, if thou dost not first yeeld vnto it; if quietly thou expectest it; if vnmoued thou receiuest
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:23208:122"/>
it; if thou dost persist certaine against incertaintie; and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, against that which most men feare: then maist thou be said truly to conquer and ouercome it. There is nothing so bitter, but an equall and constant spirit can easily digest; for many in their patient sufferings seeme to despise the most exquisite torments: <hi>Mutius,</hi> the Fire; <hi>Regulus,</hi> the Crosse; <hi>Anaxarchus,</hi> the contusion of all his members; <hi>Theramenes</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> Poyson: and when sentence of death was deliuered to <hi>Canius,</hi> from the Tyrant, hee then playing at Chesse, seemed so little daunted at the message, that without change of countenance he played out his game. And so of others. Now whence grew this magnanimitie, but from a sound and cleare conscience; assiduate practise of Vertue; and a courage armed against all disasters? Nothing is more calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, than a minde doubtfull of what is to come: To be alwayes troubled, is to be miserable before miserie happen; for there is nothing more foolishly wretched, than to be still in feare, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of death; which (if nothing else) the very necessitie thereof, and the common equalitie with all Mankind, ought to make tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>
               <p>First diligently thinke with thy selfe, That before thou diest, all thy vices die in thee. And next, That thou makest a consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of thy life, before thy death. O! when thou shalt see that time in which thou shalt perceiue no time to belong vnto thee! in which thou shalt be temperate and calme, and in thy sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dost thou weepe and lament; These things belong to those which are new borne. Dost thou thinke those things to be lost, which thou leauest? Why shouldst thou dote vpon that which was not thine own, but leant? Who is it that would set a price vpon Time, or at a deare rate estimate the Day, who truly vnderstandeth that hee is euery houre dying? In this we much deceiue our selues, That we see not Death afarre off, nor apprehend it neere. That part of our age which is past, is free; that which is behinde, is in the power of Death: neither do we fall vpon Death suddenly, but step by step we meet it by degrees: we daily die, for euery day a part of our life is taken from vs; and euen at that time when we increase, our life decreaseth: we lose our Infancie first, our Childehood next, then our Youth, and euery one of these when it arriueth to the full pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, perisheth; for yesterdayes life is this day wanting, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, this dayes being hath ceased to be: nay euen this day which wee breath, wee diuide with Death; for it is the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and point of time in which we can be said to liue; yea lesse, if lesse can be imagined: neither of that little or lesse space can
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:23208:123"/>
we assure our selues. Saint <hi>Chrisostome super Math.</hi> calleth Death The necessarie gift of corrupt Nature, which ought not feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be auoided, but rather chearefully embraced; for by making that voluntarie which is compulsiue, that which is to God a due debt, we offer vnto him as a free gift. Moreouer, a foolish and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous thing it is for men to delight in sleepe, and feare death, when sleepe is nothing else but the imitation of Death.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine, lib. de Natura &amp; Gracia,</hi> vseth these words; If thou boastest thy selfe of Nobilitie, Riches, or Honour? of thy Countrey, or the applause giuen vnto thee by the People? looke into thy selfe and consider, That thou camest from the earth, and into it againe thou must returne. Looke about, and behold all those which in times past haue flourished in the like splendours; Where be the insuperable Emperors? Where be those that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Meetings, Musicke, and Feasts; and delighted in the braue breed of Horses? Where be their Robes of state? their rich and gorgeous Vesture? Where their troupes of Followers, and large traine of Attendants? Where their sportings and Reuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings? Where be the Captains of Armies? Champions, Iudges, Tyrants? are not all Earth, Dust, and Ashes? and their magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and memorie in a small Tombe and short Epitaph contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Looke into their gorgeous and glittering Sepulchres, and see how much the Lord differs from the Seruant; Tell me which is the Rich man, and which the Poore; Distinguish if thou canst, the Captiue from the Conqueror; the Valiant from the Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; or the Faire from the Deformed.

Which is not to be questioned, but that both the good and bad Angells can without difficultie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. Neither are their faculties bounded within any limit, as to beare only this weight, or carry such a burthen; but they haue an vncurbed strength according to their owne will and purpose: insomuch that one Spirit (by Gods permission) is able to shake, remoue, or demolish a Mountaine, a City, or a Prouince, as shall hereafter be more plainely illustrated. It is also obserued, That the neerer any spirituall Substance is vnto the Creator in place, it is so much the more swift &amp; strong; and those that are farther remote, are lesse able and preualent. The Water is known to be of more swiftnesse and validity than the Earth; the Aire, than the Water; and the Moone, than either: and of all the other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, as they exceed in height, so they excel in vertue, euen vntill you come to the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> whose strength and puissance is such, that it circumrotes and turneth about all the Spheres below it, and in it's incredible celeritie, euery minute ouercomes more than a thousand miles, as astronomers report.</p>

This Fellow was as well mounted as the rest, and lead an empty or spare horse by the bridle. The Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion being a man of an vndaunted spirit, went vp close to him, and demanded what he was? and whether hee were the same Cooke
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:23208:133"/>
who had lately serued him, and whom hee had seene coffined and layd in the earth? Who answered him againe, That without any doubt or scruple, he was the selfe same man. His master then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him, what Gentlemen, or rather Noblemen (as appeared by their habit) were those that rid before? Whether he himself was then trauelling? And to what purpose he led that empty horse in his hand? To all which he replied in order; That all those horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were men of note and qualitie (naming to him diuers whom he knew were deceased) and that they were now vpon a voiage to the Holy-land, whether he himselfe was likewise bound, and that spare horse was prouided of purpose to doe him seruice, if it so pleased him, and that hee had any desire to see Hierusalem. The Centurion made answer, That with great willingnesse hee could finde in his heart to see the City, and visit the holy Sepulchre, whether (had meanes and leasure serued to his purpose) hee had long since intended a pilgrimage. The other told him, Now was the time, his horse ready, no necessaries wanting; or if he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that voyage, he could not go in better company. At which words, the bold Centurion leapt into the empty saddle, and was presently hurried away from the sight of his seruants in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and the next euening, at the same houre, and in the same place, he was found by his seruants and friends, who were there seeking and enquiring after him. To whom he related his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and what he had seene in the Holy City; describing punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally euery Monument and place of remarke: which agreed with the relations of such Trauellers and Pilgrims as had beene there and brought Certificate and assured testimonie from thence. He shewed vnto them likewise, an hand-kerchiefe which that Cooke his seruant (or rather Diuell in his likenesse) had giuen him, stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with bloud; but told him, if at any time it were foule or dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he should cast it into the fire, for that was the onely way to make it cleane.

                     <hi>Lib. de Virtut. &amp; vitijs, ca.</hi> 8.</note>Concerning Truth, you may reade Cardinall <hi>Pascalis</hi> thus: <hi>Culturae nostrae, id est, Virtutis primum instrumentum est Veritas, &amp;c.</hi> Of our culture or ornament, that is, of Vertue, the first instrument is Truth: neither can any vertue be attained vnto but by her only, who is of that sacred Societie the most choice &amp; perfect; whom the wisest and best vnderstanding men haue so highly magnified, that they haue stiled her the Mother of all Vertues, the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the most perfect amongst them, and therefore the <hi>Summum Bonum:</hi> than which there is nothing more manifest, in respect of those things which in our humane condition, are vncertaine, doubtfull, and fading. In the earth there is nothing permanent; those things which now are, in a small space haue no being; and what is future, is concealed from vs: which no sooner happeneth, than vanisheth. Truth alone standeth vpon her owne strength, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in the same state, stable in her selfe, subiect neither to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease nor decrease; repaire shee needeth not, impaire shee suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not: her Knowledge is the gift and secret of the Almightie. Truth is the absolute habit of the Minde, vnwearied, kindled by Diuine Light, all-knowing: Shee expresseth her selfe in Words, Gestures, and Actions, alwayes and euery where; her voice in all honest ears is the most excellent harmonie: She is the Guide and Conduct through the Labyrinth of humane affaires, to bring the Minde the right and straight way to the Mansion of the other Vertues. It is her sole Character, To aduance man vnto Dignity: and so granted to him from God, That hee is borne vnto one Truth; She is the onely food of the Minde, the sole repast of the Soule. Apparant it is, That all humane actions, not only by Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting or Ostentation, but by Simulation or Dissimulation, are as with furious and tempestuous windes troubled and tossed. But both these are no better than Liers; the one by adding too much, the other offering too little. But Truth triumpheth ouer both; she is liable to no prescriptions, neither to space of time, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of persons, nor the Priuiledge of Countries: the dulled Sences she restoreth, the Deceiued shee directeth, the Erronious she reconcileth; her Strength all Vaine things treads vnder foot; all Lies convinceth, all Errors confoundeth. Euen her Enemies acknowledge Her, as oft as they are brought within her Sentence: She is the sole rule by which all Knowledge is guided; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be truly knowne but Truth onely: for Falshood being excluded, and Shee admitted, the way lieth open vnto true feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</p>
               <p>In Her all the dignitie of humane life is contained; and hee that is possessed of her, no Force can deiect him, no Deceit cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent him, no Trouble of minde afflict him, no Heresie intrap

               <p>Against those that make Religion but a meere vaile or cloake for their abuses and vanities, wee reade <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Nepotianus</hi> thus: <hi>Thou buildest Monasteries, and erectest Religious hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and by thee many poor men are relieued through the Isles of Dalmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a; but better were it for thy Soules health, if thou thy self among holy men didst leade an holy life.</hi> And in another sent to <hi>Eustochium</hi> (saith he) <hi>There be some men of our Order, who for no other cause make suit to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Deaconship and Priesthood, than that thereby they might haue the greater priuiledge, and incur the lesse suspition, to enter into the familiaritie and acquaintance of faire women: The chiefest study such employ themselues in, is, that their shooes sit neate and close, their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments smell of perfume, their haire be queintly kembed and crisped, and that their fingers shine with gold and gemmes. But when thou shalt look vpon any such vaine person, hold him not for a Priest, but rather a Bride-groome.</hi> And in a third Epistle to <hi>Heliodore</hi> he vseth these words: <hi>They are richer being Monkes, than when they were secular men: They possesse wealth vnder Christ, who was alwayes poore; which they enioyed not vnder the Diuell, who was euer rich. The Church supporteth them in wealth, whom the World confined to beggerie. Therefore</hi> (saith <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius Firmianus</hi>) <hi>Heauenly Religion consisteth not of earthy or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt things, but of the vertues of the Minde, which are solely aimed at Diuine Contemplations. For that onely may be called True Worship, when the heart and minde meet together to offer vnto God an immaculate offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: for whosoeuer confineth himselfe to be a true Sectarie of the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall Precept, may attaine vnto the name of a true and sincere Worshipper; being such an one, whose Sacrifices are the humblenesse of minde, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of life, and the goodnesse of action.

First therefore concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Christian Religion, I shall quote you some passages and places cited by diuers Ethnyck Authors, and those learned and approued. After the Birth, Life, Doctrine, and Passion of the Sauiour of the World,<note place="margin">Three opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christ.</note> there were three opinions of him (I omit the Euangelists and Apostles, whose Scriptures and Miracles are vnquestionable, and proceed to others:) Of the first were those that sincerely and vnfeignedly professed Christ and his Gospell; many of which gaue apparant testimonie of the Truth: some by their blessed Martyrdome,<note place="margin">The first, Holy beginners.</note> others by their Writings; and among these were <hi>Dionysius Areopagita, Tertullian, Lactantius, Firmianus, Eusebius, Paulus Orosius, &amp;c.</hi> Others there were which violently opposed the former;<note place="margin">The second, Wicked Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners.</note> of which number were <hi>Porphyrius, Iulian A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postata, Vincentius Celsus, Africanus Lucian, &amp;c.</hi> Against whom wrot very learnedly, <hi>Cyprian, Origen,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and others. The third were such, as either for seruile feare, or worldly preferment,

durst not,<note place="margin">The third, Fearful Time-seruers.</note> or would not openly professe themselues to be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; or howsoeuer, they were such in their hearts: yet to temporise with their Superiors and Gouernors; if at any time discourse was had of those whom they called the New Sect, they would man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Christs Miracles, cauill at his Doctrine, and mis-interpret the Scriptures to their owne fancies. Notwithstanding which, and that they laboured to abolish and exterminate the Profession, yet which way soeuer they aimed their words or their works, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing still might be gathered from them, by which their malice was easily discouered, and the lustre of the Truth more apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discerned. <hi>Such Power hath the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>

He was followed by great troupes and multitudes both of Iewes and Gentiles; and hee was Christ: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was afterwards accused by the principall men of our Faith, and crucified, yet he was not abandoned of those who formerly followed him; but three dayes after his death he appeared aliue vnto them, according as the holy Scriptures had foretold and prophecied concerning him.<note place="margin">Which was 40 yeres after his Passion.</note> And euen in these our dayes, the doctrine of Christ and the name of Christian is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed through the World.</hi> And this was that <hi>Iosephus</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at the destruction of Ierusalem, and wrot the whole Historie thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> being Proconsull of Asia, in an elegant epistle writ vnto <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperor, demanded of him, How hee would haue the Christians punished? For (saith he) they arise at certain houres in the night, and assemble themselues to sing Hymnes and Songs of praise and thankesgiuing to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> whom they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as their God.

And this testimonie hee gaue of them, who was an Infidell and an Idolater, and liued sixty yeares after the Passion of our Sauiour.

Yet afterwards hee fell from that Religion, prouing a cruell and mercilesse Persecutor: for he was persuaded, That if hee should seeme to fauour or any way conniue at their Sect, the whole World would be conuerted to the Faith, and so the superstition and idolatry of the Gentiles be vtterly ouerthrowne.

               <p>It is also deliuered vnto vs by the histories of those times, That <hi>Seranus Eranius</hi> Embassador to the same Emperor, wrot vnto him from the Prouince where he was then imployed; informing him, That the great crueltie in persecuting the Christians (being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of nothing else saue their Constancy in the Religion which they professed, and could not iustly be charged with any other crimes or misdemeanors) deserued mitigation. Vpon which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the Emperour inhibited <hi>Minutius Tondanus,</hi> then Pro-Consull in Asia, from condemning any Christian for the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Faith, vnlesse he were otherwise conuicted of some cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall or capitall offence.</p>
               <p>It is a thing worthy remarke in <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi>; who, after many bloudy Persecutors, succeeding in the Empire, began much to fauour them, and suffered them to haue sundry Oratories and Temples in the Citie: who notwithstanding hee was a meere E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thnyck, and vntutered in the Christian Faith; yet (as <hi>AElius Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius</hi> reporteth of him) when diuers Cookes and Tauerners had petitioned vnto him, complaining of the Christians, saying, That they had taken their lodgings and houses from them, in which they made exercise of diuers superstitions and hypocrisies; and <pb n="304" facs="tcp:23208:158"/>
that they obserued a Religion quite contrarie from that which was then in vse with the Romans. The Emperour to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint made this following answer; <hi>

               <p>As worthy an obseruation is that of <hi>Maximinus,</hi> successor to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> and companion with <hi>Dioclesian</hi> in the Empire, about two hundred yeares after our Redemption; part of the copy of one of his Letters I will acquaint you with, being to this effect:</p>
               <p>Caesar Maximinus; <hi>Invincible, Great High-Priest, of Germany, AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Thebes, Sarmatia, Persia, Armenia, Carpia, and victorious besides ouer the Medes; and for his Conquests named, Nine times Emperour, Eight times Consull, Father of his Countrey, &amp;c. At the beginning of our Empire, we commanded all things to be done according to the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of our Lawes, (the publique discipline of Rome still conserued:) In which we gaue expresse commandement, vtterly to abolish and extinguish the Christian Religion; allotting death with torture to the Professors thereof: enioyning them to obserue those antient Customes and Laws esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by our Predecessors. But since they voluntarily rather expose their bodies to all manner of tortures, than to renounce that faith which they professe, without any will or intent to honour and adore any of our Roman gods: We therefore now mindefull of our wonted grace and clemencie, purpose to expresse the same towards these Christians; freely permitting them to haue places for their Assemblies, and to erect Temples, in which to offer vp their Sacrifices and Prayers. Which licence and faculty we grant vnto them, vnder condition, That they shall attempt nothing against our Publique-weale and Religion; and that in all other things they shall keepe and obserue our Lawes and Ordinances. Moreouer, That in gratefull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of this their free permssion, they shall stand obliged to pray vnto their God</hi> Iesus <hi>for our life and safetie, as likewise for the prosperity of the Roman Commonwealth, and our Cities continuance in peace and flourishing estate.</hi>

First according to their greatnesse, as where any creature doth exceed the proportion of it's own Kinde; so we admire a Gyant amongst Men, a Leviathan or Whale amongst Fishes,<note place="margin">Wonders in Nature.</note> a Gryphon amongst Birds, an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant amongst foure-footed Beasts, a Dragon amongst Serpents, &amp;c. The second for their smalnesse; as when certaine creatures are scanted of that dimension proper vnto their Kinde, as in Dwarfes, small Beagles, and the like: or in Moths, small Worms in the hand or finger, &amp;c. which how little soeuer, yet they parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate life and motion with those of larger dimension and size; neither are they any way disproportionate in their Kinds, but the one as well declareth the power and wisedome of the Creator, as the other. Consider therefore whether thou shouldst more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the tuskes of the Boare, than the teeth of a Worme; at the legs of a Gryphon, or a Gnat; at the head of an Horse, or a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cust; at the thighes of an Estrich, or a Fly. If in the one thou admirest the greatnesse and strength, in the other thou hast cause to wonder at the smalnesse and dexterity; as in the one thou maist behold eyes so great that they are able to daunt thee, in the other thou mayst see eyes so small, than thine are searce able to discern them: and euen in these little creatures thou shalt find such adiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and helps of nature, that there is nothing needfull or defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue in the smallest, which thou shalt finde superfluous in the greatest, &amp;c. We wonder why the Crocodile when he feeds, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not his lower chaw; how the Salamander liueth vnscorched in the fire; how the Hedgehog is taught, with his sharpe quills to wallow and tumble beneath the Fruit trees, and returne home laden with Apples to his resting place; who instructed the Ant to be carefull in Summer to prouide her selfe of food for Winter;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:23208:160"/>
or the Spider to draw small threds from it's owne bowels, to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and lay nets for the Flies? All these are infallid testimonies of the wisedome and power of the Almighty.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Of Miracles.</note>These are only wonders in nature, but no Miracles. <hi>Chrisostom supr.

And further: That of three things the World hath great cause to wonder; of Christs resurrection after death, of his ascention to heauen in the Flesh; and that by his Apostles, being no better than Fishermen, the whole world should be conuerted. But if any thing strange or prodigious hath beene heretofore done by <hi>Mahomet</hi> or his associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, they haue been rather imposterous than miraculous. Or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit they were worthy to be so called, yet do they not any way iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie his blasphemous Religion. For you may thus reade <hi>Iustine Martyr, De Respons. ad Quest.</hi> 5. <hi>fol.</hi> 162. As the Sun rising vpon the Good and Euill, the Iust and Vniust, is no argument to confirme the euil and injust man in his wickednesse and injustice: so ought it not to confirme heretiques in their errors, if at any time mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous things be done by them. For if the effect of a miracle be an absolute signe and demonstration of pietie, God would not then reply vpon the Reprobate and Cursed at the last day (when they shall say vnto him, <hi>Lord, haue we not in thy Name prophesied and cast out diuels, and done many Miracles?</hi>) <hi>I neuer knew you, depart from me ô ye Cursed, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </note>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> writeth to this purpose: Three Workes, three Mixtures hath the Omnipotent Maiestie made in the assumption of our Flesh, all miraculously singular, and singularly miraculous; Three such things,<note place="margin">Three Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> as neuer the like before were, nor shal the like hereafter happen vpon the face of the earth.

The second is,<note place="margin">The second.</note> a Virgin, and a Mother, alike admirable and singular: for it was not heard from the beginning of the world, that a Virgin conceiued, and that a Mother remained a Virgin.<note place="margin">The third.</note> The third is the co-Vnion of Faith with the Heart of Man; and this, though it seeme inferiour, yet may it appeare euery way as powerfull, if wee truly consider it: For wonderfull it is, that the Heart of Man should giue beleefe to the former. For how can humane Vnderstanding conceiue, That perfect God should be perfect Man? Or that she should remaine an vntouched Virgin, who had brought forth a Sonne? As Iron and a Tyle-sheard cannot be moulded and made into one body; so the other cannot be commixed, vnlesse the glew and soder of the Spirit of God incorporat them.</p>

for that, more than all, challenges our loue; it gently insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuateth our deuotion, more iustly exacts it, more strictly binds it, more vehemently commands it.

               <p>Briefely, The whole Passion of Christ, according to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> was for imitation, compassion, admiration, contemplation, inflammation, and thanksgiuing. According to that of <hi>Thomas à Kempis</hi>; It is of diuine Loue the Incendiarie, of Patience the Doctrine, in tribulation the Comfort. It is the solace of dissolution, the substance of holy compunction, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of internall deuotion, the exclusion of desperation, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hope of remission, the support of sharpe reprehension, the expulsion of peruerse cogitation, the repression of carnall temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the consolation of corporall imperfections, the contempt of temporall aboundance, the abdication of our proper affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the restraint of superfluous necessitie, the exercise of honest conuersation, the inflammation to amendment of life, the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to coelestial consolation, the approbation of brotherly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:23208:163"/>
the reparation of diuine contemplation, the argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future blessednesse, the mitigation of paines present, the purgation from the fire future, and the great satisfaction for all our sinnes and offences whatsoeuer. Briefely, the Passion of Christ is of a godly and religious Soule the Mirrhor, of our life the Director, of the way to heauen the Load-starre, of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests the shadow and protector, and of all Soules (in the houre of death) the comfort and supporter.</p>
               <p>The Passion of Christ (saith <hi>Rabanus de laude Crucis</hi>) sustaines heauen, gouerneth the world, pierceth hell: in the first the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are confirmed, in the second the people redeemed, in the third the Enemie subdued. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Sermon <hi>De Natali Domini,</hi> saith, That the Maker of man was made Man; that he which gouerned the Stars, should sucke the breast, that the Bread should be hungry, the Fountaine thirsty, the Light should be darkned, the Way should be weary, the Truth should suffer by false witnesse, the Iudge of the liuing and dead should by a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man be iudged, that Iustice by injust men should be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that Discipline it selfe should be scourged, the prime Branch crowned with thornes; he that made the Tree, be hanged on the Tree, Strength weakned, Health wounded, and Life made subiect vnto death.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in his first sermon <hi>De Nativit. Christi,</hi> vseth these words; <hi>Vt in Paradiso terrestri quatuor fuere fontes, &amp;c.</hi> As in the earthly Paradise there were foure Riuers which watered the whole earth; so in Christ, who is our Paradise, wee may finde foure Fountaines: the first is the fountaine of Mercy, to wash away our sinnes by the waters of Remission: the second is the fountaine of Wisedome, to quench our thirst with the waters of Discretion: the third is the fountaine of Grace, to water the plants of good Works with the springs of Deuotion. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Twelue most grieuous and intolerable sufferings of Christ are obserued from the Euangelicall historie;<note place="margin">Twelue grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </note> his Agonie sad and bloudy, than which spectacle, nothing since the Creation of the World hath beene more admirable. Secondly, That for so vile a price hee should be sold and deliuered vp to his wicked and bloud-thirsty enemies, by one of his owne Disciples. 3. That with his hands bound, hee should be led like a captiue through the publique street. 4. That like a slaue hee should be so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely scourged. 5. That his browes should be pierced with Thornes. 6. That hee should be affronted with so many contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies and injuries, as his face spit vpon, his cheekes buffetted, his head strooke with a rod, his party-coloured Vesture, and hee brought to be arraigned at the Bar for a Malefactor. 7. That he
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:23208:164"/>
was held more vile and vnworthy than the murtherer <hi>Barabas.</hi> 8. That vpon his wearie and bruised shoulders he should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to beare that Crosse on which he was to suffer. 9. That hee was adiudged to suffer so long and lingering a death. 10. That when he was nothing but sorrow and anguish, and paine all ouer, yet he should be so scornefully derided of his enemies. 11. That he beheld his most innocent Mother present in all his torments. 12. That when his most holy body hung in the Aire and Sunnes meridian heate, bloudy all ouer, the fountaines of his veines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing emptied, and his bowels dried vp; demanding but a little water, they offered him gall and Vineger. Who euer heard such things? Who euer suffered the like things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bonaventure</hi> in his sixtieth Sermon, <hi>De Tempore,</hi> obserueth his sufferings to be vnspeakeable, from ten circumstances: First, the Nobilitie of the Sufferer. 2.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:23208:164"/>
greatest that had euer before been seene, or found to be recorded in writing; which continued from the sixt vnto the ninth houre: and during this Eclipse, the trembling of the earth was so great in Asia and Bithynia, that infinite structures of great magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and strength were vtterly demolished.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Eclipse, you may reade <hi>Bellarmine, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>De Septem verbis,</hi> thus: Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> saith there was darknesse ouer the face of the earth, from the sixth houre to the ninth. And Saint <hi>Luke, cap.</hi> 23. <hi>And the Sunne was darkned:</hi> Three difficulties (saith he) are here to be explained;<note place="margin">The first Difficulty.</note> First, that the Sun vseth to be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in his light, by reason of the interposition of the new moon, when she is directly interposed betwixt it and the earth; which could not happen at the death and passion of our Sauior, because it was not then conioyned with the Sunne, which hapneth in the new Moone onely, but was opposed to the Sunne as being in her plenitude or fulnesse; for then was the feast of Easter among the Iewes, which according to their Law beginneth the fourteenth day of the first moneth.<note place="margin">The second Difficulty.</note> Againe, If in the Passion of Christ the Moone were conioyned with the Sun, yet the darkenesse could not continue the space of three houres, that is, from the sixt houre to the ninth; for the totall Eclipse of the Sunne cannot endure long, especially if it be obscured all ouer, so that it shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the whole body of the Sun, and that his dimnesse cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called Darkenesse: for the Moone is moued with more swiftnesse than the Sunne in it's owne proper motion, and for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat cause cannot obumbrate the Sunne but for a short season, for it quickely giueth place, leauing the Sunne free to his owne proper lustre.<note place="margin">The third Difficulty.</note> Lastly, It can neuer happen, that by reason of the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with the Moone, the Sunne can leaue the world in vniuersal darkenesse: for the Moone is much lesse than the Sun, nay not so great in compasse and quantitie as the earth, and therefore by the interposition of it's body the Moone cannot so shadow the Sun, to leaue the whole earth in darknesse. Now if any shall obiect and say, That the Euangelist spake onely of the vniuersal land of Palestine; that likewise may be very easily refuted.</p>
               <p>First, By the testimonie of <hi>Dionisius Areopagita,</hi>

                  <hi>Phlegon</hi> a Greeke Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and a Gentile, saith, That in the fourth yeare of the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fourth Olympiad, a great and remarkable defect of the Sun was obserued, the like neuer before seene; for the day at the sixth houre was turned into tenebrous night, insomuch as the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:23208:165"/>
Starres were visibly seene in the Firmament. And this Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liued in Greece, and far remote from Iudaea. <hi>Origines</hi> against <hi>Celsus,</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his Chronicle, to the thirty third yeare of Christ cite this Author.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lucianus</hi> Martyr.</note>Of the same witnesseth <hi>Lucianus</hi> Martyr, saying, Seeke in your Annals and you shall finde, that in the time of <hi>Pilat,</hi> the Sunne being banished the day, gaue place to darkenesse. These words <hi>Ruffinus</hi> vseth in his translation of his Ecclesiastical History into the Latine tongue. So likewise <hi>Tertullian, in Apollogeticon:</hi> and <hi>Paulus Orosius</hi> in his historie.</p>
               <p>But all these doubts may be decided, and these difficulties be easily made plaine: for where it was said, That the defect of the Sunne still happeneth in the new Moone, and not when it is at the full, most true it is in all naturall Eclipses: but that which happened at the death of our Sauior was singular and prodigious, which could onely be done by him who created the Sunne, the Moone, the Heauens, and the Earth. For <hi>Dionysius Areopagita,</hi> in the place before cited, affirmeth, That himselfe, with one <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> saw the Moon about mid-day, with a most swift and vnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall course haste vnto the Sunne, and subiect it selfe vnto it, and as it were cleaue thereunto, vntill the ninth houre, and then by the same way returne to it's owne place in the East.</p>
               <p>Concerning that which was added, That no defect in the Sun could possibly continue for the space of three houres together, so tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> darkenesse might ouershadow the whole earth: it is thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, Most true it is, that in an vsuall and naturall Eclipse it remains infallibly so; but this was not gouerned by the Lawes of Nature, but by the will of the omnipotent Creator, who as he could carry the Moone with a swift course from the Orient, to meet with the Sunne in the meridian, and after three houres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne it backe into it's owne place in the East; so by his power he could bring to passe, that these three houres hee could stay the Moone with the Sunne, and command her to moue neither more slowly nor swiftly than the Sun.</p>
               <p>Lastly, where it was said, That it was not possible this Eclipse should be seene ouer the face of the whole earth, considering that the Moone is lesser than the earth, and therefore much lesse than the Sunne; there is no question but true it is, if we reflect but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the interposition of the Moone alone: but what the Moone of it selfe could not do, the Creator of the Sunne and Moone had power to do. For things created can doe nothing of themselues, without the aid and co-operation of the Creator. And whereas some may obiect and say, That through the darkenesse made by the thicke and dusky clouds, the light might be obscured from
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:23208:165"/>
the vniuersall face of the earth. Neither can that hold currant; for then those foggie and tenebrous clouds had not only couered the Sunne and the Moone, but those very Stars also, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that darkenesse were visible, and manifestly discouered to shine in the Firmament.</p>
               <p>Now there are diuers reasons giuen, why it pleased God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, that at the passion of our Sauior the Lord of life, such darkenesse should be;<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Isay.</hi> 60. <hi>ver.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>For behold, Darkenesse shall couer the earth, and thicke darknesse the people, &amp;c.</hi> The second cause was, To shew the great and apparant sinnes of the Iewes: which Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Comment vpon Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> doth thus illustrate; Before, (saith he) euill and wicked men did vex and persecute good and just men: but now impious men haue dared to persecute and crucifie God himselfe, cloathed in human flesh. Before, Citisens with Citisens had contention; strife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got euill language, ill words, and sometimes slaughter: but now, seruants and slaues haue made insurrection against the King of Men and Angels, and with incredible audacitie nailed him vnto the Crosse. At which the whole World quaked and trembled, and the Sunne it selfe, as ashamed to looke vpon so horrible and execrable an act, withdrew his glorious lustre, and couered all the aire with most terrible darknesse.</p>
               <p>Thus you haue heard the Incarnation, Life, Doctrine, Miracles, and Death of the blessed Redeemer of the World, God and Man; from whom we ground our Christian Religion. Now because I had occasion to speake of the Turkish Alcaron, and the apparant absurdities contained therein, it shall not be amisse to insert som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the Authour thereof; that comparing his life with his doctrine, the basenesse of the one may make the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the other appeare the more odious and abhominable.</p>

                  </note> That he was descended nobly: but his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is not approued. Therefore I rather follow <hi>Pomponius Lata,</hi> in his Abridgement of the Romane Historie: who, agreeing with other authentik Authors, deriues him from an ignoble, vile, &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Linage. Some say he was an Arab, others a Persian: nor are either of their opinions to be reiected, because at that time the Persians had the predominance ouer Arabia.

               </p>
               <p>He was of a quicke and actiue spirit, left an Orphant, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yong, was surprised by the Scenites, who were of the Arabs in Africa, and liued as Theeues and Robbers. Being by them sold
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:23208:166"/>
vnto a rich Merchant named <hi>Adimonepli,</hi> because the Lad was wel featured and quicke witted, hee vsed him not as his slaue, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as his sonne. Who accordingly mannaged all his masters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires with great successe, trading dayly both with Iewes and Christians; by reason of which hee came to be acquainted with both their Lawes and Religions. His master died without issue, leauing his Widow who was about fifty yeares of age, named <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digna,</hi> wonderous rich: shee after tooke <hi>Mahomet</hi> to husband, by which mariage hee suddenly became, of a poore slaue, a wealthy master of a family.</p>
               <p>About that time one <hi>Sergius</hi> a Monke, a debosht fellow, of a spotted life and base condition, (who for maintaining of sundrie dangerous heresies, was fled out of Constantinople, and for the safegard of his threatned life, thought to shelter himselfe in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia) in processe of time grew into great acquaintance and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie with <hi>Mahomet</hi>; who consulted together and began to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect great matters. Now <hi>Mahomet</hi> hauing before been entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the study of Magicke or Necromancie, resolued to persuade the Gentiles that he was a Prophet. To prepare which, hee had practised diuers iugling trickes, by which his wife and his owne houshold were first abused. To further which credulitie, hee was troubled with the Falling Sickenesse: at which his wife and the rest of her Neighbours being amased, he made of that this diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish vse, to persuade them, That at such time as the fall took him, the Angell of God came to confer with him, and hee being but mortall, and not able to endure, his diuine presence, was forced into those sudden agonies and alterations of spirit.</p>
               <p>This being generally reported, and confidently beleeued, his wife soon after died, leauing him her vniuersall heire of great pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions and mighty summes of money: which both emboldened and strengthened him in his diabolicall proceedings; so that by the assistance of <hi>Sergius</hi> the Monke hee now openly proclaimed himselfe a Prophet, and sent of God to prescribe new lawes vnto the Nations. And hauing before made himselfe skilfull in all their Lawes, the better to countenance and corroborate this his Innouation, he thought to accord with the Iewes in some points, to continue them his friends; and in some things with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, lest he should make them his enemies. He likewise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with diuers Heretiques: with the Macedonians he denied the Holy-Ghost to be God; with the Nicolaitans, he approued the multiplicitie of Wiues, &amp;c. On the other side, he confessed our Sauiour Christ to be an holy man, and a Prophet; and that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was an holy and blessed woman, whom in his Alcaron he much extolled. With the Iews he held circumcision;
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:23208:166"/>
with many other of their ceremonies. Besides, his Religion gaue all the abhominable vices of the flesh, free scope and libertie: which drew vnto his new Sect much confluence of people from many Nations and Languages, to be his abettors and followers. His booke he called the Alchoran: and lest his diuellish impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and absurd impostures should be examined, and by that meanes discouered, hee made it a penaltie of death for any man, To argue or make difficultie of any Tenent contained therein: making protestation, That they ought to be supported &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Armes, and not by Arguments. His first attempt was, To set vpon the confines of Arabia; <hi>Heraclius</hi> being then Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, who held his seat at Constantinople, at the same time <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the first was Pope, and <hi>Honorius</hi> his successor.</p>
               <p>The newes of this great insurrection comming to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors eare, he prepared to suppresse it with all speed possible; and to that end he entertained into his Pay the Scenites, a warre-like people of Arabia, who before had in their hearts much fauoured <hi>Mahomet;</hi> by whose aid, in the first bloudy Conflict he was victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and dispersed this new Sect, and had hee followed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent fortune, he had quite abandoned it from the face of the earth. But supposing them by this first defeat sufficiently disabled, and himselfe secured, hee failed to keepe promise with the Scenites, and detained their pay: who in meere despight, that they had bin deluded and so injuriously dealt with, ioyned themselues with <hi>Mahomets</hi> dis-banded Forces, and by reason of his former r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus animated by the successe in these wars, he was sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puft vp with a vain glorious ambition to conquer and subdue the whole world. His next expedition therefore he aimed against the Persians, a Nation at that time very potent, and held to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible. His first aduenture succeeded ill, for his army was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated: but after hauing re-allyed his forces, in his second at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt fortune so fauoured him, that hee compelled them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Religion. Briefly, (and to auoid circumstance) after he had run through many hazards, and prosperously ouercome them, he was poysoned, and dyed (according to <hi>Sabellicus</hi>) in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth yere of his age. And because he had told his complices and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:23208:167"/>
adherents, That his body after his death should ascend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, they kept it for some dayes vnburied, expecting the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so long, till by reason of the infectious stench thereof none was able to come neere it.

               <p>Thus according to my weake Talent <hi>(Crassa Minerva)</hi> I haue spoke something generally of those three Religions still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the world. As for the differences betwixt our Church and the Church of Rome, I must needs confesse my weaknesse no way able to reconcile them, or determin betwixt them: and therefore I leaue that to those of greater knowledge and iudgement. But as touching Iudaisme and Mahumetisme, I conclude with an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigram transferred out of the Greeke tongue into the Latine, and by me thus paraphrased:

                     <hi>Tantalus</hi> his punishment in hell for his too much loquacity, was, To be thirsty in the midst of water, and hungry where there was plenty of Fruits. Nature hath afforded vs double eyes and eares to behold all objects, and to listen vnto all voices and sounds: but to warne vs that we should be sparing in our speech, shee hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded man but one tongue, and that portall'd with lips, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullis'd with teeth; neere to which are placed all the fiue Sences, to signifie vnto vs, That we ought to speake nothing rashly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their connsell and aduice; with the helpe of the faculties of the Soule, which are Reason and Vnderstanding, which haue their residence in the braine.</p>

Hence is the word <hi>Socors, i. sine Corde,</hi> without a heart: and <hi>Socor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> which intimates Sloath; and <hi>Concors,</hi> which is, Of one Heart or of one Minde. And so much for the word. Saint <hi>Augustine super Ioan.</hi> saith, That the Gluttonous man hath his Heart in his Belly; the Lasciuious man, in his Lust; the Couetous man, in his Lucre or Gaine.<note place="margin">Of the Heart of Man.</note> 
                  <hi>Hugo, lib de Anim.</hi> hath these words; The Heart is a small thing, yet desireth great matters; it will scarce suffice a Kyte for a breake-fast, yet a spatious World can scarce suffice the appetite thereof. For amongst all the Creatures sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to haue commerce with mundane vanities, than the Heart of man nothing more noble, nothing more sublime, nothing more like vnto the Creator: And therefore, ô Man, He reciprocally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth from thee nothing so much as thy Heart. Man examineth the Heart by the words, but God ballanceth the words by the Heart. What is an hard and obdure Heart? (saith Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> 5. <hi>de Consider.</hi>) It is that which by Compunction is not wounded, by Pietie is not mollified, by Prayers is not moued, by Threats is not changed: by Afflictions it is hardned, for Benefits receiued ingratefull, in Counsels committed Vnfaithfull, in judgements pittilesse, in Immodest things impudent, in Dangers improui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in Humane things inhumane, in things Diuine rash &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; of Past things forgetfull, of Present things neglectfull, of Future things vnmindefull. It is indeed that thing, of which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may be said, Of Past things, all things passe it saue injuries; and of things Future there is nothing expected, but how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge

them. <hi>Hierome, sup. Mat.</hi> 5. saith, When God leaueth the Heart it is lost, when He filleth it, it is found; neither by depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it doth he destroy it, but rather by departing from it, leaue it to it's owne perdition. I will shut vp the Sentences of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers introduced to this purpose, with that of Saint <hi>Bernard, in Serm. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Injurijs</hi>; The Heart of man is diuided into foure Affections, What thou louest, What thou fearest, What thou reioycest in, and What thou art sorry for. But the puritie of the Heart consisteth in two things, first in acquiring the glory of God; and next in seeking the profit of our Neighbour.</p>

                  <hi>Prior omnium ertata est Sapientia:</hi> Wisedome hath been created before all things.

               <p>
                  <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Syrach,</hi> in that place, by this Wisedome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth the Angelicall Nature, often termed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Life, Wisedome, and Light. For the Angels are called and said to be Vnderstanding: and though they were created with the Heauen and Time; yet are they said to be first created, by reason of their Order and Dignity, being the most worthy and excellent Creatures. Neither were these Angelical Powers (saith he) made for any need or necessitie that the Almighty God had of them; but to the intent that he might be contemplated, praised &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and his liberalitie and bounty be the more aboundantly knowne throughout all generations.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is written, That God created all things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; being elsewhere said in <hi>Genesis,</hi> That he produced all those bodily Substances by pauses and distinction of dayes:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Dionysius Rihellus</hi> to that hath giuen a sufficient answer, namely, That the Substances of things were created together, but not formed and fashioned together in their seuerall distinct kindes.

               <p>It is worthy remarke, which one ingeniously obserues: Two wayes (saith he) we come to the apprehension and knowledge of God; by his Workes, and by his Word: by his Works we know that there is a God, and by his Word we come to know what that God is: his Workes teach vs to spell; his Word, to reade. The first are his backe-parts, by which we behold him afarre off: the later represent him vnto vs more visibly, and as it were face to face. For the Word is as a booke consisting of three leaues, and euery leafe printed with many letters, and euery letter containeth in it selfe a Lecture. The Leaues are Heauen, the Aire, and the Earth, with the Water: the Letters ingrauen, are euery Angell, Starre, and Planet: the Letters in the Aire, euery Meteor and Fowle; those in the Earth and Waters, euery Man, Beast, Plant, Floure, Minerall, and Fish, &amp;c. All these set together, spell vnto vs, That there is a God.</p>

                  <hi>Moses</hi> in the very first verse of <hi>Genesis</hi> refuteth three Ethnycke opinions: first, Those that were of opinion the World was from eternitie, and should continue for euer; in these words, when hee saith, <hi>In the Beginning.</hi> Secondly, he stoppeth the mouth of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and prophane Atheists, in this phrase, <hi>Elohim created.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lastly hee opposeth all Idolaters, such as held with many gods; for the saith in the conclusion of the same Verse, <hi>Elohim, He</hi> created Heauen and Earth; vsing the singular number. It is the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:23208:191"/>
opinion of some antient Diuines, That the Creation of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels was concealed by <hi>Moses,</hi> lest any man should apprehend (like those Heretiques spoken of by <hi>Epiphanius</hi>) that they aided and assisted God in the Creation. For if the day of their Creation (which as the best approued Theologists confesse, was the first day) had beene named by <hi>Moses,</hi> wicked and vngodly men might haue taken them to haue been Agents in that great and inscruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Worke; which indeed were no other than Spectators. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as God hid and concealed the Body of <hi>Moses</hi> after his death, lest the Israelites (so much addicted to Idolatry) should adore and worship it; so <hi>Moses</hi> hid and concealed the Creation of the Angels in the beginning, lest by them they should be deified, and the honour due to the Creator, be by that meanes attributed and conferred on the Creature. <hi>Rabbi Salom</hi> affirmeth them to be created the first day: and some of our later Diuines, the fourth day; but their opinions are not held altogether authenticall.</p>
               <p>It is likewise obserued, That God in the creation of the world beginneth aboue, and worketh downwards. For in the first three dayes he layd the foundation of the world; and in the other three dayes he furnished and adorned those parts. The first day he made all the Heauens, the matter of the earth, and commeth downe so low as the Light. The second day he descendeth lower, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Firmament or Aire. The third, lowest of all, making a distinction betwixt the Earth and Water. Thus in three dayes the three parts or body of the World is laid; and in three dayes more, and in the same order, they were furnished. For on the fourth day, the Heauens, which were made the first day, were dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and stucke with starres and lights. The fift day, the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which was made the second day) was filled with Birds and Fowles. The sixt day, the Earth (which was before made fit and ready the third day) was replenished with Beasts, and lastly with Man. And thus God Almighty in his great Power and Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, accomplished and finished the miraculous worke of the Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rabbi Iarchi</hi> vpon the second of <hi>Genesis</hi> obserueth, That God made superior things one day, and inferiour another. His words being to this purpose: In the first day God created Heauen aboue, and Earth beneath: on the second day, the Firmament aboue: on the third, Let the dry land appeare beneath: on the fourth, Lights aboue: and the fift, Let the waters bring forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, &amp;c. On the sixt day he made things both superior and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior, lest there should be confusion without order in his Work. Therefore he made Man consisting of both, a Soule from aboue, and a Body from beneath, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:23208:192"/>An Allegorie drawne from these is, That God hath taught vs by the course he took in the framing and fashioning of the world, how we must proceed to become a new Creation, or a new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and Earth, renewed both in soule and body. In the first day he made the Light; therefore the first thing of the new man ought to be light of Knowledge: for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>He that commeth to God must know that He Is.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note> On the second day he made the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so called because of it's stedfastnesse: so the second step in Mans new Creation must be <hi>Firmamentum Fidei, (i.)</hi> the sure foundation of Faith. On the third day, the Seas, and Trees bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Fruit: so the third step in the New man, is, That he become Waters of relenting teares,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.</note> and that he bring forth fruit worthy of Repentance. On the fourth day God created the Sunne, that whereas on the first day there was light without heate, now on the fourth day there is Light and Heate ioyned together. So the fourth step in the new creation of the New man, is, That he joine the heate of Zeale with the light of Knowledge; as in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Fire and Salt were euer coupled. The fift dayes worke was of Fishes to play in the Seas, and the Fowles to fly and soare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heauen. So the fift step in a New Creature, is, To liue and reioyce in a sea of Troubles, and fly by Prayer and Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards Heauen. On the sixth day God made Man: now all those things before named being performed by him, Man is a new Creature. They are thus like a golden Chaine concatinated into seuerall links by Saint <hi>Peter; Adde to your light of Knowledge, the firmament of Faith; to your Faith, seas of repentant Teares; to your Teares, the fruitfull Trees of good Workes; to your good Workes, the hot Sun-shine of Zeale; to your Zeale, the winged Fowles of Prayer and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</hi> And so, <hi>Ecce, omnia facta sunt nova, Behold, all things are made new, &amp;c.</hi>

The sixt day God created the four-foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Beasts,<note place="margin">Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming &amp; fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of man.</note> male and female, wilde and tame. The same day also he made Man; which day some are of opinion was the tenth day of the Calends of Aprill. For it was necessarie (saith <hi>Adam</hi> arch-Bishop of Vienna, in his Chronicle) That the second <hi>Adam,</hi> slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in a vivifying death, onely for the saluation of Mankinde,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:23208:193"/>
should sanctifie his Spouse the Church, by those Sacraments which were deriued out of his side, euen vpon the selfe same day, not onely of the weeke, but of the moneth also, wherein hee crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Adam</hi> our first Father, and out of his side brought forth <hi>Evah</hi> his wife, that by her helpe the whole race of Mankinde might be propagated.</p>
               <p>God made Man after his owne Image, to the end that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dignitie of his Creation, he might be the rather incited to loue and serue him. Not that hee should proudly ouerweene, That the shape and figure of God is answerable in a true and iust conformity with his owne; for the word Image is not so to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, to accord &amp; correspond with the exterior shape or simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, but rather with the spirituall Intelligence, which consists of the more pretious part, namely the Soule. For as God by his vncreated Power is wholly God, gouerning and giuing life to all things; (for as the Apostle saith, <hi>In Him we liue, moue, and haue our Being</hi>) euen so the Soule by his prouidence giueth life to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and vnto euery part thereof; and is said to be the Image of God, like as in the Trinitie: for though in name it is but one Soule, yet hath it in it selfe three excellent dignities,<note place="margin">The three dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Soule.</note> The Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the Will, and the Memorie.</p>
               <p>And as the Son is begotten of the Father and the Holy-Ghost, and proceedeth both from the one and the other; in like manner is the Will ingendred of the Vnderstanding and Memorie. And as the three persons of the Trinitie are but one God, so these three powers and faculties of the Soule make but one Soule.</p>
               <p>Man then was created according to the Image of God,<note place="margin">The end, why Man was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</note> that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Like delighting in his Like, hee should euermore wish to bee vnited vnto his Similitude, which is God: first, to acknowledge him: next, in knowing him, to honor him; and in honoring him, to loue him;<note place="margin">Why God made man vpright.</note> and in louing him, to serue and obey him.

               <p>Of Soules (saith <hi>Cicero,</hi> 1. <hi>Tuscul.

For in such natures there is nothing that can comprehend the strength of Memorie, the Minde or Thought; which can record what is past, or foresee things future; which do altogether participate of a Diuine nature.

Consider with thy selfe, ô Man, and bethinke thy selfe what thou wast before thou hadst Being: Certainely nothing at all; for if any thing, thou shouldst remember what thou hadst beene. Thou therefore that wast nothing before thou wert, shalt againe be made nothing when thou shalt cease to be. And why canst thou not againe from Nothing haue Being, by the wil of the same Workeman, whose will was, That at the first thou shouldst haue existence from nothing? What new thing shall betide thee? Thou which wast not, wert made; when thou againe art not, thou shalt be made. Giue me (if thou canst) a reason, how thou wert created at first; and then thou mayst resolue mee how thou shalt be re-created againe. Obserue how the Light this day failing, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againe tomorrow; and how the Darknesse, by giuing place, succeedeth againe in it's vicissitude. The Woods are made leaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and barren, and after grow greene and flourish. The Seasons end, and then begin: the Fruits are first consumed, and then repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red most assuredly: the Seeds prosper not and bring forth before they are corrupted and dissolued. All things by perishing are preserued: all things from destruction are regenerated. And thou ô Man, thinkest thou that the Lord of the Death and the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will suffer thee therefore to dye, that thou shalt altogether perish? Rather know, That wheresoeuer thou shalt be resolued, or what matter soeuer shall destroy, exhaust, abolish, or reduce thee to nothing, the same shall yeeld thee vp againe and restore thee: For to that God, the same nothing belongs, who hath all things in his power and prouidence. The whole frame of heauen (saith Saint <hi>Ambrose in Psal.</hi> 119) God made and established with one hand; but in the creation of Man he vsed both.

               <p>The Hierogliphycke of Man is the Palme tree;<note place="margin">Hierogliphick</note> and that for a twofold reason: first, Because it bringeth forth no fruit, vnles the male be planted neere and in sight of the female. By which it is imagined they haue a kinde of <hi>Coitus</hi> or copulation; the boughes being full of masculine gemmes, like seed. And next, because in the vpper part thereof there is a kinde of braine, which the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes call <hi>Halulab,</hi> and the Arabs, <hi>Chedar,</hi> or <hi>Gemmar</hi>; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bruised or tainted, the tree instantly withereth, (as man dieth presently when his braine is perished) which is onely to be found in this Plant. Besides, in the top or head thereof there is that which resembleth haire. The branches grow after the manner of the armes and hands, extended and stretched forth; and the fruit thereof is like fingers, and therefore are called <hi>Dactili,</hi> or <hi>Digiti, Erudit. quid. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Hierogl.

               <p>Concerning Hell and the torments thereof,<note place="margin">Of Hell.</note> wee reade the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thus. <hi>Gregory, Moral. lib.</hi> 9. saith, In horrible manner it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to those wretched Soules, who haue Death without death, End without end, Defect without defect: because Death euer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, the End alwayes beginneth, and Defect knoweth not how to be deficient: Death slayeth, but killeth not, sorrow excrucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but easeth not; the flame burneth, but consumeth not. And the same Father, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Dialog.</hi> The Soule confined thither hath lost the happinesse to be well, but not to Be: for which reason it is compelled to suffer death without death, defect without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, end without end; because vnto it, Death is made immortall, Defect indeficient, and End infinite. And Saint <hi>Augustine, lib. de Agenda cura pro Mortuis</hi>; speaking of the Rich man tormented in Hell, saith, That his care of the Liuing, whose actions hee knew not, was like ours of the Dead, or whose estate wee are ignorant. <hi>Isiod. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Summo Bono,</hi> saith, That the fire of Hell giues light vnto the Damned, so farre as they may see whereat to grieue, but not to behold from what they may draw comfort. And the same Author in his Meditation, <hi>Gehennalis, supplicij</hi>; Consider all the paines and afflictions of this World, all the griefe of torments, the bitternesse of sorrowes, and grieuousnesse of afflictions, and compare them with the least torment of Hell, and it is easie which thou sufferest: for the punishment of the Damned is in
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:23208:200"/>
that place doubled; for sorrow burneth the heart, and the flame the body. And <hi>Hugo, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Anima</hi>; The infernall Lake is without measure, it is deepe without bottome, full of incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable heate, full of intollerable stench, full of innumerable sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes: there is miserie, there is darkenesse, there is no order, but all confusion; there is horror eternall, no hope of any good, nor termination of euill.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Chrisostome, Hom.</hi> 48. <hi>de Ira,</hi> vseth this similitude: I would not haue thee to thinke, (saith he) that as it is in this life, so it is in the other; That to haue partners and companions in grief can be any comfort or abatement to thy sorrow, but rather of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. For tell me, If a father condemned to the fire, shal behold his sonne in the same torment, will not the very sight thereof bee as another death vnto him? For if those who be in perfect health, at the sight of others torments faint, and are ready to depart with life; how much more shal they be afflicted and excruciated, when they are fellow-sufferers of the same tortures? Mankind is prone to compassion, and wee are easily moued to commiserate other mens grieuances: Therefore how can the Father take comfort to behold his sonne in the same condemnation; the husband the wife, or the brother the brother? &amp;c. rather it doth adde vnto their miseries, and make their griefe the greater,.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Origen, in Matth. cap.</hi> 16. vseth this comparison; As euery gate of a city hath it's proper denomination; so may wee say of euery port or dore that opens into Hell: one may be called <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio,</hi> or Whoring, by which Whore-monghrs enter: another, Swearing, by which Blasphemers haue accesse. And so of Enuy, Gluttony, and the rest; euery one bearing name according to the nature of the offence.</p>

                  <hi>Bion</hi> was wont to say, That the passage vnto Hell was easie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men might finde the way thither blinde-fold, or with shut eyes. For so it fareth with all dead men: from whence wee reade that in <hi>Virgil:</hi>

               <p>And <hi>Demonax</hi> being demanded of one, What he thought the estate and condition of the Soules departed was, in the other World?
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:23208:200"/>
made answer, That he could not as then resolue him, but if hee had the patience to stay till hee had beene there, hee would write him newes thereof in a letter. Intimating thereby, That hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued there was no Hell at all. <hi>Erasmus, Lib. Apotheg. Sophocles, in Oëdip.</hi> calleth Hell a blacke Darknesse. And <hi>Euripides, in Aristid.</hi> An obscure House or Pallace, shadowed from the bright beames of the Sunne. <hi>Theogius</hi> giues it the name of the Blacke Gates. And <hi>Eustathius, in</hi> 1. <hi>Isliad,</hi> saith it is a dark place vnder the earth. Saint <hi>Basil, sup. Psal.</hi> 33. calleth it a darke Fire that hath lost it's brightnesse, but keepes it's burning. And Saint <hi>Gregory, Moral. lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 46.

               <p>The antient Poets, in regard of the tenebrositie thereof, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Hell to a territorie in Italy betwixt Baiae and Cumae, where a people called Cimerij inhabit; which is so inuironed with hills and mountaines, that the Sunne is neuer seene at any time of the yeare to shine amongst them.

               <p>Hell is likewise called <hi>Tophet,</hi> which was a Valley neere vnto Ierusalem, ioyning to the Fullers Poole, and the field <hi>Acheldema,</hi> scituate on the South side of Sion. It is called likewise <hi>Gehinnon,</hi> of the Valley of <hi>Hinnon,</hi> because the place was the habitation of one <hi>Hinnon</hi>; and for that it was once in his possession, therefore euen to the dayes of our Sauior it bare his name. Such is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Aretius:</hi> and in this Valley did the Iewes (following the abhomination of the children of <hi>Ammon</hi>) sacrifice their children in the fire to the Idoll <hi>Moloch.</hi>

his owne children. It was a brasen Image, hollow within, and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with his hands spread abroad, ready to receiue all such infants as through their cursed Idolatry were tortured in the fire, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed vnto him. <hi>Snepfsius</hi> describeth this Idoll to be made of Copper, and stretching forth his armes and hands in manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Figure of a <hi>Moloch.</hi>
                  </note>The Iewes write of this Idoll <hi>Moloch,</hi> That he was of a large and mighty stature, fashioned like those vsed amongst the Serro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides the antient Inhabitants of Gaule, (now France.) Hee had within his bulke or belly seuen seuerall roomes or chambers; the first was to receiue all such meat as was offered vnto him; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Turtle Doues; the third, a Sheepe; the fourth, a Ramme; the fist, a Calfe; the sixt, an Oxe; the seuenth, a Childe.

But this he holdeth not to be altogether authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique; but rather of the Hebrew word <hi>Toph,</hi> which signifies a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bret or loud Instrument: because when they sacrificed their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they strooke vpon their Tabrets, that their noise might drowne the shriekes and clamors of their Infants, when they past through the fire: For so saith <hi>Piscator</hi> vpon <hi>Esay.</hi>

                  </note>To the Dialogue of <hi>Lucianus</hi> before recited, (intitled <hi>Nyceoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> or an Answer from the Dead) the most learned and neuer to be forgotten S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <hi>Lucian</hi> (saith he) would leaue that chiefely to be remembred vnto vs, which towards the conclusion of the Fable is whispered in the eare of <hi>Menippus</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Tyresias:</hi> namely, That a priuat and retyred life is the most contented and secure of all other. Which the Grecians seeme likewise to allude vnto into their old Adage, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For Riches, Glory, Power, Potency, with things of like nature and condition, which the World see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth most to acquire, are most fraile and vncertaine. But chiefly
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:23208:201"/>
the liues and fortunes of Rich men, as they are the most subject and obnoxious to casualtie and disaster; so they haue the greatest correspondence with solemne Pomps and tragick Fables; which in many of their miserable ends is frequent and apparant. Which the World giueth vs cleerely to vnderstand, by that Decree made in Hell against auaritious and rich men: in their bodies are not onely designed to diuers pains and tortures, but euen their minds and soules transmigrated and shifted into Asses and brute beasts. By which he insinuateth vnto vs, That these couetous men be for the most part barren of learning, sloathfull, and wanting iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is inscribed, <hi>An Answer commanded from the Ghosts or the Dead:</hi> by which is manifest, That hee obserueth the selfe same course in this Dialogue, which ariseth from that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proposed to be learned from <hi>Tyresias.</hi> For alwayes in these or the like titles, some aime at the noblenesse of the person, some at the dignitie of the Argument: after the manner of <hi>Plato,</hi> whom <hi>Lucian</hi> in this Dialogue seemeth most to imitate. It consisteth of a long narration, in which he commemorateth both the cause and the manner of his descent into the darke and lower Regions; and the withall the occasion why so peremptory and strict an Edict was denounced against the Rich men of the world. The maine and most illustrious things in this Fable contained, are, The fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and vncertaine doctrines and documents of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; the superstition and power presupposed to be in Magiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Magicke: The seuerall roomes and corners of Hell, with the torments and punishments inflicted vpon the miserable and wretched Ghosts; with the equalitie of the persons there. And lastly, a cgmparison of Humane life, with the affinitie it hath to vaine Pompe, and the Fables deuised by the Tragicke Poets.

               <p>But from the Poets, it behooues mee to looke backe vnto the Theologists; for with the torments in Hell there is no jesting. <hi>Bullinger</hi> in <hi>Esay,</hi> with other approued Diuines, hold the fire of hel to be true and substantiall fire.

First, They

are said to differ in respect of heat; for this here, compared with that there, is but as fire painted. For the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaking of that terrible fire, saint, <hi>Who is able to dwell in this deuouring fire? or Who shall be able to dwell in these euerlasting burnings?</hi> Secondly, In regard of the light; for ours is luminous, chearfull, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; but the fire of Hell giueth no lustre at all. For as <hi>Gregory, Mor. cap.</hi> 46. saith, <hi>Cremationem habet, lumen vero non habet. i.</hi> It bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but lighteth not. Thirdly, our elementall fire consumeth the body onely, but that of Hell burneth both body and soule. Fourthly, Our elementary fire confirmieth only that which is cast into it; but that of Hell doth alway burne, but neither wasteth it selfe, nor that which it burneth. Fiftly, The one may be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, the other can neuer be extinguished and put out: <hi>The Chaffe</hi> (saith the Text) <hi>shall be burned with vnquenchable fire.</hi>

The reason of this perpetuity is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold: the first drawn from the state and condition of the Majesty offended. The second, from the state and condition of the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; for as long as they remaine sinnefull, so long shall they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine tormented for sinne. But in Hell they euer remaine sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and sinne is like oile, and the wrath of God like fire; as long as the oile lasteth, the fire burneth; and so long as sinfull, so long tormented, and therefore damned for euer. For most sure it is, That in Hell there is neither grace nor deuotion. The Wicked shall be cast <hi>in exteriores tenebras, extra limitem Divinae misericordiae; i.</hi> Into vtter darknesse, without the limits of Gods mercie. For though their weeping in Hell may seeme penitentiall; yet they
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:23208:205"/>
do but <hi>Lugere poenas, non peccata</hi>; lament their punishment, but not their sinne. The third reason is drawne from Gods justice; for when life was offered them, they refused it: and therefore just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when in Hell they beg it, they go without it.</p>

For as <hi>Stobaeus</hi> saith, The dread and terror of inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table punishment is the sole cause of desperation.

               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca, in Octavia,</hi> saith, <hi>Inertis est nescire quod li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat sibi:</hi> It is the part of a sloathfull man to be ignorant of such things, to the knowledge of which he by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry may attaine. It is a thing worthy remarke, to obserue how the Dull and Stupid emulate and enuy the Pregnant &amp; Learned. One not vnfitly compared them to a Fox,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Henv. Bibellius lib. facetiar.</hi> 1.</note> who being hungry, and spying a Peare tree laden with ripe fruit, layd all his force to the root thereof; but finding his strength too weake, and that by his vaine shaking thereof nothing fell from thence, he departed, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fie vpon them, these Peares are a bitter fruit, and would neuer haue agreed with my stomacke. The same Fox looking vpon an Asse, and imagining that his hanging testicles would euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant fall; after he had followed him some miles, till he was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and finding himselfe frustrat of his expectation, returned back with these words; Now I consider better with my selfe, the stones of this Asse are stinking and loathsom, besides they are very hard of digestion. It may be thus applied: There is no wise or discreet man but doth honour all good Sciences and humane Learning; To such onely they are in contempt and scorne, whose weaknesse of iudgement, and imbecilitie of braine finde themselues vnable to attaine to such noble Mysteries.</p>
               <p>It is reported of one <hi>Daiglinus</hi> a Mimicke in the city of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, That hearing of a simple and ignorant man to be elected Consull, came to him in a kinde of gratulation for his new ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in these words; O Sir, I hold you to be a most fit man to vndertake this noble Office of Iudicature. The other demanding of him the reason why he thought so? He made him this answer;
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:23208:230"/>
Because, Sir, you haue so husbanded your good words, and so trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured vp your wisedome, that hitherto neither of them hath been heard to proceed from you. Of such wise Senators there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe amongst the Germans to this purpose; If thou hast Wit which thou wouldst not be rob'd of, trust it with such an Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for there it shall be most safe, because no man will suspect any such thing from him. To be ignorant in such things as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne euery man in his priuat estate, is not onely a blemish, but a mischiefe.

               <p>Of wilfull Ignorance saith <hi>Salomon, Qui evitat discere, incidit in mala:</hi> He that despiseth to learne, falleth into euil, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were my People lead captiue, because they had no knowledge</hi>; saith <hi>Esay, cap.</hi> 5. And in <hi>Cap.</hi> 27. <hi>It is not a wise People, therefore hee will not haue mercy on them, that made them; and Hee that fashioned them will not spare them.</hi> And <hi>Baruch, cap.</hi> 3. <hi>And because they had no wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome they perished in their folly.</hi> We reade Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> thus: Of the euill mother Ignorance come two like bad Daughters, Deception, and Doubt; the one wretched, the other miserable; the first pernitious, the last pestilent. <hi>Bernard</hi> in one of his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles saith, Men are ignorant of many things needful to be known, either by the injurie of Knowledge, the sloathfulnesse in learning, or the backwardnesse in acquiring; yet are none of these excusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And the same Father, <hi>sup. Cant.</hi> The knowledge of God and thy selfe, are both necessarie to saluation: for as from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy selfe the feare of God ariseth in thee, and by that knowledge thou art taught how to loue him; So on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, From not knowing thy selfe groweth Pride, and from not knowing God, Desperation. And in another place; <hi>Ignorantia sui initium omnis peccati; ignorantia Dei consummato omnis peccati, &amp;c.</hi> The blockishnesse of the minde is the stupiditie of acute reason, bred from the grosse sences of carnall Intemperance.<note place="margin">

excused who gladly would learne if they knew what to learn; but such cannot be pardoned, who knowing from whom to learne, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not their will and industrie vnto it. <hi>Seneca</hi> in one of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs saith, It is a more tollerable punishment not to liue at all, than not to liue a Knowing man. And in another of them; It is no lighter thing to be altogether ignorant what is lawfull, than to do that which is vnlawfull. <hi>Socrates</hi> saith, Where there is no Capacitie, there Counsell is vainly bestowed. And <hi>Solon</hi>; Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance hath euer the boldest face, nor is it easie to be truely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, till it be matched by Knowledge. The Inscious man may be knowne by three things: He cannot gouern himselfe, because he wanteth Reason; nor resist his carnal affections, because he lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Wisedome; nor hath he freedome to do what himselfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth, because he is in bondage to Ignorance. Idlenesse begetteth Ignorance, and Ignorance ingendreth Error. The three-shap'd Monster <hi>Sphinx</hi> is the emblem of Ignorance; which is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed:

If therefore neither accidentally nor naturally, it must needs inferre, they arise by a more sublime Intelligence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uperant aboue the power or strength of Nature. And they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto three chiefe causes. For there is Person, which is the Daemon Familiar, which the Theologists call <hi>Angelus Custos.</hi> Then there is a Power, called the Keeper or Gardian of the Place, the House, the City, or the Kingdome; and this is tituled by the name of Principate. Aboue these is the sublime Order or Chorus of Powers, Daemons, or Angels; into which number or lot, by the similitude of Office, the excellent Minde or Soule is to shift, as it were into it's owne Star, there to remaine as a Collegue in the same office. And as there are three Authors of prodegies, so there are three kindes: The sublime Classe kindleth the crested or bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Comets, prouoketh Thunder, casteth out Lightning, causeth Incendiaries and falling Starres. The Power of the Prouince, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Prefect, ouerturneth buildings, declareth Oracles, and designeth violent Heats and Vapours. The Familiar Custos or Daemon begetteth Dreames, causeth or disturbeth sleepes, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth charge of man as well in his priuat chamber, as in the streets or fields. The first giueth vs to know, That excellent Spirits are not by Death extinguished or neglected, but are rather transmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated from the earth, to reigne with the Powers aboue. The

second fore-shewes the calamitie of a People new left destitute of a Prince or Gouernor; thereby fore-warning them to preuent and prepare themselues against all imminent perils. The third giues vs warning, that the time of the last expiration being come, his friends and Allyes should take notice of the Diuine fauour, that his body dying, his Soule still suruiueth, and that hee is not lost to his friends and familiars. This was the opinion of some Philosophers. <hi>Iamblic. de Myster.</hi> saith, That as God oftentimes from the mouth of Fooles produceth wisedome, declaring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that Man speaketh not, but God himselfe: so by euery sleight and vile thing hee portendeth what is to ensue, keeping still his owne super-eminence, and thereby instructing our weake vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. And <hi>Guliel. Pachimer. Hist. lib.</hi> 6. saith, <hi>Prodigium est Divinae irae signum, &amp;c.</hi> A Prodegy is a signe of the wrath of God; but whether it portendeth or looketh vpon things past or present, is beyond our apprehension.

               <p>In the discourse of <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his Adherents, newly fallen from grace, it will not be impertinent to speake something of his first and greatest master-piece, in tempting our first Parents to sinne, by which came death. For Death was not made by God, being nothing els (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> against the Pelagians saith) but a priuation of life,<note place="margin">

The story saith, In this anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and perturbation of minde he thought it best to fly for succor to the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; and to that purpose retired himselfe to a Temple consecrate vnto her, in which he tendred many sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and prayers, ioyned with fasting and teares, making great shew of effectuall repentance.

and praying; presenting his blasphemous writing vpon the Altar, which miraculously (as they say) was taken thence, and he receiued againe into Gods fauor.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The maner of Homage done to the Diuell.</note>The manner of this homage (and others) done to the Diuell, is as followeth: First, the Magitian or Witch is brought before the Tribunal of Sathan, either by a familiar Spirit, or else by a Mage or Hag of the same profession: hee sits crowned in a Majesticke Throne, round inguirt with other Diuels, who attend on him as his Lords, Barons, and Princes, richly habited. The Palace see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth wholly to be built of marble, the walls hung with gold and purple-coloured Arras; all shewing the pompe of regalitie and state. Sathan himselfe from his Royall seat casts his eyes round about, as if ready to incline his benigne eares to any humble sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>Then steps forth a Diuell of a venerable aspect, and saith, O most potent Lord and Master, great Patron of the spacious Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, in whose hands are all the riches and treasures of the earth, and all the goods and gifts of the world, this man I present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine Imperiall Throne, to follow thy standard, and to fight vnder the patronage of thy great name and power; who is ready to acknowledge thee to be God and Creator of all things, &amp; none but thee. It shall be in thy clemencie, ô most soueraigne Lord, to vouchsafe this man (or woman) the grace of thy benign aspect, and receiue him (or her) into thy patronage and fauor.</p>
               <p>To which he with a graue countenance and loud oration thus answereth; I cannot but commend this thy friend, who so cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hath committed himselfe into our safegard and trust; whom as our Client and Fauorit we accept, and promise to supply him with all felicitie and pleasure, both in this present life and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This done, the miserable wretch is commanded to renounce his Faith and Baptisme, the Eucharist, and all other holy things, and to confesse <hi>Lucifer</hi> his onely Lord and Gouernor. Which is done with many execrable ceremonies, not fit to be here remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. Then is the Writing deliuered, (as was before spoken of <hi>Theophilus</hi>) written with the bloud of the left thumbe. Then doth the Diuell marke him either in the brow, neck, or shoulder, but commonly in the more secret parts, with the stampe or character of the foot of an Hare, a blacke Dog, or Toad, or some such figure, by which he brands him (as the custome was of old to mark their slaues and captiues whom they bought in the market for mony) to become his perpetuall slaue and Vassal.</p>
               <p>And this, <hi>Nigerius, Sprangerus, Bodinus, &amp;c.</hi> say, The wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth, as desirous to imitate God in all things; who in the old Testament marked his chosen People with the seale of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,

to distinguish them from the Gentiles; and in the New Testament with the signe of the Crosse, which, as <hi>Hieronimus</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen</hi> say, succeeded that of Circumcision. And as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell is alwayes aduerse to his Creator, so hee will be worshipped with contrarie Rites and ceremonies. Therefore when Magitians and Witches present themselues vnto him, they worship him with their faces from, and their backes toward him, and somtimes standing vpon their heads, with their heeles vpward: but which is most beastly and abhominable of all, in signe of homage hee presents vnto them his taile to kisse.

                  <hi>Mengius</hi> reporteth, from the relation of a deare friend of his, (a man of approued fame and honestie) this historie: In a certain towne vnder the jurisdiction of the Venetians, one of these prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigious Artists (whom some call Pythonickes) hauing one of these Rings, in which he had two familiar Spirits exorcised and bound, came to a Predicant or preaching Frier, a man of sincere life and conuersation; and confessed vnto him, that hee was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of such an inchanted Ring, with such Spirits charmed, with whom he had conference at his pleasure. But since he considered with himselfe, that it was a thing dangerous to his Soule, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:23208:244"/>
both to God and man, he desired to be clearely acquit thereof; and to that purpose hee came to receiue of him some godly counsell. But by no persuasion would the Religious man be induced to haue any speech at all with those euill Spirits (to which motion the other had before earnestly solicited him) but admonished him to cause his Magicke Ring to be broken, &amp; that to be done with all speed possible. At which words the Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars were heard (as it were) to mourne and lament in the Ring, and to desire that no such violence might be offered vnto them; but rather than so, that it would please him to accept of the Ring and keepe it, promising to do him all seruice and vassallage: of which if he pleased to accept, they would in short time make him to be the most famous and admired Predicant in all Italy. But he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Diuels cunning, vnder this colour of courtesie, made absolute refusall of their offer; and withall conjured them to know the reason why they would so willingly submit themselues to his patronage? After many euasiue lies and deceptious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, they plainly confessed vnto him, That they had of purpose persuaded the Magition to heare him preach, that by that sermon his conscience being pricked and galled, he might be weary of the Ring; and being refused of the one, be accepted of the other: by which they hoped in short time so to haue puft him vp with pride and heresie, to haue precipitated his soule into certaine and neuer-ending destruction. At which the Church-man being zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously inraged, with a great hammer broke the Ring almost to dust, and in the name of God sent them thence to their own ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of darknesse, or whither it pleased the higher Powers to dispose them.</p>

                     </note>A morall interpretation may be gathered from the same, with this Motto anexed, <hi>Omnia in meliorem partem. Bodinus</hi> saith, Men vse to chuse a faire day, by the gray morning; and strong beasts, by their sturdy limbes: But in choice of pleasures there is no ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be made, since they yeeld vs no profitable vse. Others chuse Aduocates by the throng of their Clients: Physitions, by the fame of their Cures: and Wiues, by their rich Portions or Dowers. And well they comply with the prouerbe, He that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his choice without discretion, is like one that soweth his Corne he wots not when, and in the haruest expected reapeth hee knoweth not what. Needfull it is therefore that wee be chary in our choice, since there are so few brought within the compasse of Election. According to that of the Poet.</p>

As hee who snatcheth a Brand out of the fire, taketh not hold thereof by that part which is flaming, but rather that which hath not touched the fire; so we ought not to meddle with the bitter and burning things of Chance, but rather such as are more benign and comfortable.</p>

It was the Fall of Angels; and is that folly in Man to bring him to perdition. It striueth to haue a hand in euery noble Vertue, as it hath an interest in euerie detestable Vice.

Nay further, it hath beene knowne, That men of most submissiue spirits haue gloried, That they could so far humble themselues, as being proud, that they haue not been more proud. It hath made zealous men presume of their merit, wretched men to boast of their misery. Come to the Deadly sins; It is Pride in the Enuious man, to maligne the prosperitie of his neighbor; in the Wrathfull man, to triumph in the slaughter of his enemy; in the Luxurious man to trick himselfe vp, and glory in the spoile of his Mistresse: in the Sloathfull, to scorne labour, and delight in his ease: in the Auaritious, to despise the Poore, and trust in his aboundance.

they should grow insolent, when hee spareth and cherisheth the Lesse. Thou seest likewise, how often, lofty Towers, eminent Buildings, and procerous Trees are blasted by Lightening, and torne by Thunder. For God hateth the Ambitious and Proud, as delighting to depresse all things that swell aboue Nature or Custome. Hence it comes that mighty Armies are discomfited by small Hosts, either by striking them with feare, or submitting them to disaduantage: For God wil not suffer any to think mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently and gloriously of their owne power, saue himselfe, <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid. lib.</hi> 2. vseth these words, <hi>Etiam cum innoxia est superbia, molesta esse non desinit, &amp;c. i.</hi> Pride euen when it seemes to be most harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, yet euen then it doth not cease to be troublesome.

               <p>To this Pride (which was the sin of the Angels, and therefore the cause that they were precipitated from heauen into hell) wee may adde their Ingratitude, who notwithstanding the dignity of their Diuine nature, durst oppose themselues against Him who had created them of such excellence. How heinous may we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that offence was in Angels towards their God; when it is held so odious and abhominable (for any benefit receiued) in one man towards another? Saint <hi>Augustine, in lib. de Poenitentia; In hoc quisque peccato fit culpabilior, quo est Deo acceptior, &amp;c.</hi> In this euery Sinner is made more culpable, in that to God hee is more acceptable: and therefore <hi>Adams</hi> sinne was the greater, in regard that in his creation he was the purer.

saue in their aduersitie they neuer remember him; after the feare is past, and that the danger is blowne ouer, him whose assistance they implored in their want, they forget in their fulnesse; and whom they sought after in their penury, they now fly in their plenty.

               <p>The ingratefull man (or rather Monster) is by the Ethnycke Authors diuersly branded. One writeth thus: <hi>Ingratus qui benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium accepisse, negat quid accepit, ingratus qui id dissimulat, &amp;c.</hi> He is called an ingratefull man, who hauing receiued a benefit, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth to haue receiued it: he is so called that dissemblerh it: he likewise incurreth the same aspersion that requiteth it not: but aboue all, that character is most iustly conferred vpon him that forgets it. It is a sinne that walketh hand in hand with Insolence and brasen-fronted Impudence, saith <hi>Stobaeus.</hi> And according to <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> it ariseth either from couetousnesse, or suspect. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimides</hi> saith, Benefits well and carefully conferred, strengthen and establish a Kingdome: but seruice vnrewarded, and gifts vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily bestowed, weaken and dishonour it. Old kindnesses (saith <hi>Pindarus</hi> the excellent Greek Poet) are apoplexed and cast asleepe, as void of all sence; and all men, as stupified, are turned ingratefull. For according to the Cynicke <hi>Diogenes,</hi> Nothing so soone waxeth old and out of date, as a courtesie receiued. <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi> is of opinion, That all such as receiue gifts, courtesies, or good turnes from others, should not onely frequently remember them, but liberally requite them: thereby imitating our Mother Earth, which still returneth more fruit than it receiueth seed. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> affirmed all such as were vnthankfull, to haue in them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nobilitie nor justice. According to that saying of <hi>Stobaeus,</hi> Gratitude consisteth in Truth and Iustice; Truth, in acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging what was receiued; and Iustice, in repaying it. The Lawes of Persia, Macedonia, Athens, &amp;c. punished Ingratitude with death. And <hi>Plato</hi> can teach vs, That all humane things quickely grow old and hasten to their period, onely that sin excepted: and he giueth this reason, Because that the greater increase there is of men, the more Ingratitude abounds. The Ingratefull is held to be of worse condition than the Serpent, who reserueth venom and poyson to hurt others, but keepeth none to harme himselfe. I conclude with <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philosopher; If we be naturally incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to obserue, and to offer all our seruice to such from whom we but expect a benefit; how much more then are we obliged to such

The like <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor, fift of that name, to his father <hi>Henry. Darius</hi> tooke counsell to kill his father <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> by whom he was before made King. And <hi>Lucius Ostius,</hi> in the time of the Ciuill wars, when his father <hi>Armalius</hi> was proscribed, and the Triumvirat prosecuted his life, he his son betrayed him to the Lictors, &amp; brought them to the place where he then lay concealed; for no other cause, but that hee might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy his possessions. <hi>Marcus Cicero,</hi> at the command of <hi>M. Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> one of the Triumvirat, was slain by <hi>Pompilius Lemates,</hi> whose life he had before defended, and acquitted from the strict penalty of the Law. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, forgetfull of his Nurse <hi>Hellonice,</hi> from whom he had receiued his first milk, caused her brother <hi>Clitus</hi> afterward to be slaine. <hi>Anthonius Caracalla</hi> being aduanced to the Roman Empire, amongst many others whom he caused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently to be butchered, he spared not <hi>Cilones</hi> his tutor, by whom he was first instructed, notwithstanding he had been a Counsellor to his father, and a man notable for his wisdome and temperance. No lesse was the ingratitude of the Senat of Rome vnto <hi>Scipio A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus,</hi> who notwithstanding that he had subdued Carthage, the onely City that durst affront or contest with Rome through the whole world; yet being accused by <hi>Petilius,</hi> they arraigned him in open Court, and proscribed him, because that all the treasure which he had woon in Asia, he had not brought into the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Rome. But of all the rest, that to me is most remarkable recorded by <hi>Zonarus</hi> &amp; <hi>Cedrenus,</hi> of the emperor <hi>Basil. Macedo,</hi> who being hunting (as he much delighted in that exercise) a great stag incountring him, fastned one of the brouches of his hornes into the Emperors girdle, and lifting him from his horse, bare him a distance off, to the great indangering of his life. Which a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the traine espying, drew out his sword and cut the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors girdle, by which meanes he was preserued, and had no hurt at all. But note his reward; The Gentleman for this act was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, and adiudged to haue his head strooke off, because he da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to expose his sword so neere the Emperours person: and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red according to his sentence.</p>

In the purchasing of which (as one ingeniously said) he gets carefulnesse to himselfe, enuy from his neighbour, a prey for theeues, perill for his person, damnation to his soule, curses for his children, and Law for his heires.

               <p>Auarice is defined to be a vice in the soule, much like vnto a Dropsie in the body; by which a man coueteth, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> to extort from others, without right or reason. And againe, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and injustly it with-holdeth from others what truly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto them, without equitie or conscience. It is also a penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and niggardly sparing to giue, but a readinesse, nay greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to receiue whatsoeuer is brought, neuer examining whether it be well or ill attained.

This hellish Vice in mine opinion is as bitterly reproued as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously obserued by <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> in one of his Satyrs. Part of his words be these:

Vsurie, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and most fruitfull-breeding daughter of old Auarice, was so much at one time despised and hated in Rome, that <hi>Appian</hi> in his first booke of Ciuill warres commemorateth vnto vs, That there was a great penaltie imposed vpon any noble Citisen, who would shew himselfe so degenerate as to contract her: for it is said of her, That she bringeth forth her children before they be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:

besides, she is most hated of those whom shee seemeth most to gratifie. And according to that of the Poet,
<q>

The filthy and base gaine of Increase, and the swift returne of Vsurie murdereth the Poore and Needy.

               <p>Obserue what Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith in one of his Sermons: It is no lesse fault in thee to take away from him that hath, than when thou thy selfe art able, to deny thy charitie to such as want. It is the bread of the Hungry which thou detainest, and the garment of the Naked which thou keepest backe; the money which thou hoordest and hidest in the earth is the price and redemption of the Captiue and Miserable. Know that thou takest away the goods of so many as thou deniest to do good vnto, when thou canst and wilt not. Those are not a mans riches which he cannot carry with him to the graue: Mercy onely and Charitie are the inseparable companions of the Dead.</p>

And in another of his Sermons he saith, A Couetous man is the Purse of Princes, a store house of Theeues, the discord of Parents, and the hisse of men. <hi>Gregorie, Moral. lib.</hi> 14. saith, That the sinne of Auarice so burdeneth and weigheth downe the mind which it hath once possessed, that it can neuer be raised to haue a desire to behold things sublime and high. <hi>Hugo, lib. de Clav.</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, In the goods and riches which wee possesse there are foure things to be obserued; namely, That things lawfull to be sought, we seek not vnjustly; and things vniustly sought, we inioy not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully; that wee possesse not too much, though lawfully; nor things lawfully possessed, we vnlawfully defend: for either euilly to acquire, or things euilly obtained, what was lawfull maketh to be vnlawfull. For a man to possesse much to himselfe, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neere to couetousnesse; and oftentimes it so falleth out, that what is too much loued, is euilly defended. S. <hi>Bernard, Serm.</hi> 39. saith, Auarice is drawne in a Chariot with foure wheeles, &amp; these are called Pusillanimitie, Inhumanitie, Contempt of God, and Forgetfulnesse of Death. The beasts that draw it be two, Tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and Rapacitie: and these are guided and gouerned by one Chariotier, called a Greedy Desire of Hauing.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Inuitor being horribly vexed, broke out into these words, saying, Since all these men haue thus failed me, I wish that so many Diuels of hell would feast with me to day, and eat vp the victuals prouided for them: And so in a great rage left the house, and went to Church, where was that day a Sermon. His attention to which hauing tooke away the greatest part of his choler, in the interim there arriued at his house a great troupe of horsmen, very blacke, and of extraordinarie aspect and stature: who alighting in the Court, called to a Groome to take their horses; and bade another of the seruants run presently to his master, and tell him his Ghests were come. The seruant amased runneth to Church, and with that short breath and little sence he had left, deliuers to his master What had happened. The Lord calls to the Preacher, and desiring him for that time to breake off his Sermon, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise him by his Ghostly counsel, what was best to doe in so strict an exigent: hee persuades him, That all his seruants should with what speed they could depart the house. In the meane time they with the whole congregation came within view of the Mansion: Of which all his seruants, as well men as maids, had with great affright cleared themselues, and for haste forgot and left behinde a yong childe, the Noblemans sonne, sleeping in the cradle. By this the Diuels were reuelling in the dining chamber, making a great noise, as if they had saluted and welcommed one another: and looked through the casements, one with the head of a Beare, another a Wolfe, a third a Cat, a fourth a Tygre, &amp;c. taking bowles and quaffing as if they had drunke to the Master of the house. By this time the Nobleman seeing all his seruants safe, began to remember his sonne, and asked them What was become of the childe? Those words were scarce spoke, when one of the Diuels had him in his armes, and shewed him out of the window. The good-man of the house at this sight being almost without
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:23208:306"/>
life, spying an old faithfull seruant of his, fetcht a deep sigh and said, O me, what shall become of the Infant! The seruant seeing his master in that sad extasie, replyed, Sir, by Gods helpe I will enter the house, and fetch the childe out of the power of yon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, or perish with him. To whom the master said, God prosper thy attempt, and strengthen thee in thy purpose. When hauing taken a blessing from the Priest, he enters the house, and comming into the next roome where the Diuels were then rioting, hee fell vpon his knees, and commended himselfe to the protection of Heauen. Then pressing in amongst them, he beheld them in their horrible shapes, some sitting, some walking, some standing. Then they all came about him at once, and asked him what busines he had there? He in a great sweat and agonie (yet resolued in his purpose) came to that Spirit which held the Infant, and said, In the name of God deliuer this childe to mee. Who answered, No, but let thy master come and fetch him, who hath most interest in him. The seruant replied, I am come now to doe that office and seruice to which God hath called me; by vertue of which, and by his power, loe, I seise vpon the Innocent. And snatching him from the Diuell, tooke him in his armes, and carried him out of the roome. At which they clamored and called aloud after, Ho thou Knaue, ho thou Knaue, leaue the childe to vs or we wil teare thee in pieces. But he, vnterrified with their diabolicall mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, brought away the Infant, and deliuered it safe to the father. After some few dayes the Spirits left the house, and the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entred into his antient possession.

Who calling and becko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to them both with voice and gesture, and they not daring to approch them, they vsed such vndecent skipping and leaping, with such brutish and immodest gestures, that halfe dead with feare, they were inforced to take them to their heeles and runne,

                     <hi>Fincelius</hi> remembreth vnto vs, That in the yeare 1532, a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman of his country had commanded a countreyman a Tenant of his with whom he was much offended, either to bring home to his Mannor house a mighty huge Oke which was newly felld, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that and Sun-set, or he should forfeit his time, and the next day be turned out of his cottage. The poore husbandman brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his cart to the place, but looking vpon the massie timber, and finding it a thing vnpossible to be done, he sits down, wrings his hands, and falls into great lamentation. When presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before him one of these Spirits in the shape of a laboring man, and demanding him the cause of his sorrow; he was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner resolued, but, If that be all (saith the Diuell) follow me, and I will saue thee the forfeiture of thy Leafe. Which he no sooner said, but he tooke the huge Oke, boughes, branches and all, and threw it vpon his shoulder as lightly, as if it had beene a burthen of Firres or Broome; and bearing it to the house, cast it crosse the gate which was the common entrance into the house, and there
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:23208:307"/>
left it. The Gentleman returning towards night with his friends from hawking, spying the doore barricadoed, commanded his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to remoue the tree: But forcing themselues first to stir it, then to hew it with axes, and lastly to set it on fire, and finding all to be in vaine; the master of the Mannor was inforced to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother doore cut out in the side of his house, to let his Ghests in, for at the backe gate hee had vowed not to enter, hauing before made a rash Oath to the contrarie.</p>

Neither was he onely seene of the Youth himselfe, whom he pretended so much to loue, but of diuers of the Domesticks also.

                  <p>It is reported, That a Spirit in the shape and habit of <hi>Policrates</hi> was created Prince of AEtolia;<note place="margin">This History I receiued from D. <hi>Strozza, lib. de Incant.</hi>

He left her with child, and when the time of her deliuerie came shee brought forth an Hermophrodite, of a monstrous and prodigious shape: at which the parents of the Lady much astonished, calling the Senatours together in the market place, caused it there to be publiquely shewen, and then demanded of them, What should be done with the Monster? Some gaue their censure, That they should burie it aliue; others, That it should be consumed with fire: and some againe, That the mother with it should be banished and excluded the confines of AEtolia.

The AEtolians at this horrid spectacle strooke with feare and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, fell to a second Counsell amongst them, to send to the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to know what this portent might signifie.

Or, Whether they haue the power to cast men into long sleepes? as wee haue read of some, who haue not onely slept moneths, but yeares, and afterwaked.</p>
                  <p>Of the first there is no question; for many Witches and prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigious Magi haue endured torments beyond the sufferance of man, without the least sorrow or complaint, sigh or grone.

Some haue this power from a Contract made with the Diuell, vsing medicines or appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations made of the small bones, the ashes, or fat of Infants, or of men slaine or executed; or by swallowing a King of the Bees, who is prime Ruler of the Hiue, and bigger than the rest: or by bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about certaine parts of their body scrolls of parchment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed with diabolicall characters; or by the muttering of some inchantment.

their bodies and garments in no part consumed, but sound and whole as at the first, who by their habits appeared to be antient Romans.

                  <p>I spake before of certaine notes or indubitable marks by which the good Spirits or Angels might be distinguished from the bad Genij or euill Daemons.

                  <p>The good Angels are imployed in nothing saue the honour of God, and the profit and preseruation of good men. When on the contrarie, the Caca-Daemons aime all their enterprises and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours to derogate from Gods worship, and assume it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; and by their flattering deceptions and oily insinuations with man, to worke the vtter subuersion both of soule and body. For as Sathan hath the power to transforme himselfe from an ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly Diuel to an Angell of Light; therefore ought we to haue the greater care, both to distinguish him in his shape, and discouer him in his nature. For all apparitions whatsoeuer, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade to blasphemie, superstition, lying, man-slaughter, luxurie, or any other thing execrable, doe infallibly proceed onely from the Diuell.</p>

Those also that put themselues vnder any certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellations, by which to beget rare and prodigious effects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the worke is taken from the Creator, and attributed vnto his creatures the Starres; those are Diuels.

Which being obserued by one of the Seniors of the Societie (who much grieued that they had fotsakeu their former austeritie, to embrace such a dissolute life) and perceiuing whence they grew to be such Libertines, he tooke with him one of the same Fellowship, a man of his own strict conuersation, with purpose to giue the Nobleman a visit. Who making them friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and courteous entertainment, this Frier amongst other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, demanded of the Lord the reason why he, being so many yeares together so sparing and close-handed toward his Brethten, was of late grown so profusely bountifull? Who answered, That it was at the great intercession of his iust and faithfull Steward, whom he much loued, and no lesse trusted. The Religious man desired that he might be acquainted with this good seruanr. To which motion the Nobleman was very willing, and caused him to be enquired for and called into his presence. Who after much delay being forced to shew himselfe, the Deuout man by some secret marke or other (before spoken of) knowing him to be a wicked Spirit, hee instantly disappeared and was no more seene. Thus the Impostor being discouered, to the great wonder of the Nobleman; the good Frier returning backe to the Monasterie,

To whom he againe as confidently answered, that if he failed of his word, and kept not his promise, he would hold him for one of the basest and most abject Diuels that fell with their arch-Captaine <hi>Lucifer.</hi> That night <hi>Anthon.

The Diuell went then to the top of the house, and began to vntile the roofe, as if hee purposed there to make his entrance. But hee continuing his godly meditations, was no further troubled, but slept quietly the remainder of the night. The next day comming againe to visit his Patient, whom the Diuell had possessed; after he had prayed with her a while, he began to vpbraid the Diuell of promise-breach, and told him that he had neither visited nor terrified him, no not so much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred his chamber, which he bragged and boasted he would do. To whom he replied, That he was at the doore and knockt; &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, That hee had vntiled a grear part of the house, but had no power to enter, the place being so munified and defended by his holy supplications. Nay more, if all the legions of hell should haue attempted it, it had been in vaine, since there is no inuasion or irruption to bee made by them into a place sanctified and made holy by prayers and blessings of holy and deuout men. He then profered the Diuell to remoue his bed into any other open place, where was no roofe nor couering: but he refused to meddle with him vpon any termes.

Therefore when he beheld the holy Apostles to worke true Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles meerely and immediately by the powerfull hand of God, and in the name of our Redeemer, hee offered them a great summe of money to purchase from them the gift of the holy-Ghost; as knowing that to be reall and essentiall, and his spells and riddles to be nugatorie and vaine.<note place="margin">
