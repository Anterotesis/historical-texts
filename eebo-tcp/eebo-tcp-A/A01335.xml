            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE CHRISTIAN READER: WILLIAM FVLKE WISHETH GRACE AND PEACE from God the father, and from our Lord Iesus Christ.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great bragges that vvere made by diuers Papistes of this treatise of Purgatory that it vvas vnansvver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, vvere so vntollerable, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine of my godly friendes vvere moued thereby, to sende the booke to me, desiring me to shape an aunsvvere vnto it. But vvhen I had readde it ouer, and founde therein in deed much nevv ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, yet nothing else but the olde fonde kinde of reasoning, I vvas altogether vnvvilling to deale vvith it, both because there hath bene so much already vvritten of that argument, and for that I thought, that our contrymen vvere novv, as vvel by reading of that vvhich hath ben vvrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before, as also by continuall preaching against that absurde doctrine, sufficiently dissvvaded from that blaspemous heresie of Purgatory. But vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this excuse, or any other that I could bring, vvoulde not satisfie there ernest desier, vvho im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunatly
<pb facs="tcp:2890:4"/>
still vrged me to take the matter in hand, &amp; that I had once againe perused the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, I began to thinke othervvise of the vvhole case, then I did before. I considered that many there vvere, vvhich perhaps had not seene, and many also that vvoulde not reade, such bookes as haue bene vvritten in times past of this question, &amp; that some also vvere so simple, that they could not discerne this nevv disguised defence of the Catholike churches doctrine, from the olde drousie dreame of popish Purgatory. VVherefore if any one of these, or any other that shall voutsalfe to reade this ansvvere, might therby either be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in trueth, or reclaymed from error: I began to thinke it vvere sufficient cause for me to take the paines, and the paines so taken to be vvel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stovved. Againe vvhen I remembred the spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rayling, and the most disdainefull arrogance of <hi>Allen</hi> him selfe, together vvith the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous boasting, and vaine confidence, that some of his friends haue in his vvriting: I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that smal zeale of godlines that is in me, both to meinteine the common hope of Christians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the insolent assaultes of so malicious and proud an aduersary, and also to discouer the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie &amp; feeblenesse of that fortres, vvhich these vvillfully blinde Papistes do vaunt to be inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb facs="tcp:2890:4"/>
In vvhich doinge I haue vsed great breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not onely by a naturall inclination, vvherby I loue to be short, in any thing that I vvright: but also because my friendes vrged me, to dispatch it vvith so great expedition. And yet in this short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I trust I haue not omitted any thing, that hath any shadovv of reason or shevv of matter in it, but that I haue sufficiently discharged it: as the diligent and attentiue reader, I hope vvill confesse no lesse. Hovv be it neither my hast in finishing, nor my friendes diligence in soliciting, vvas so great, but the slacknesse and vntovvard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of some Printers vvas much more. For vvhere as it vvas ended &amp; authorized almost tvvo yeares a goe, yet it hath stayed hetherto, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a godly and learned brother, vvho vvas once purposed to haue aunsvvered the same him selfe, and colde full vvell and substantially haue acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him selfe there in, if other busines had not hindred him, moued of godly zeale, hath novv at the last vndertaken the printing thereof, and brought it to this passe as you see. I hearde of late also of a third man, vvhich had learnedly begon the aunsvvering of this booke, hovv so euer he vvas letted from accomplishing the same. But hovv so euer Satan hath hether to hindred the setting abroade of this aunsvvere, yet God hath
<pb facs="tcp:2890:5"/>
novv at the length brought it forth: I doubte not but to his glorie and the confusion of Satan in his membres the Papistes.</p>
            <p>I haue thought good also to ioygne vnto this vvorke, an other short treatise that hath lyen by me these eight or nine yeares, vvritten at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of a godly and learned friende of mine, in aunsvvere to a proude challenge of the Papist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vvhich though at the first &amp; many yeares after, I determined not to publish, supposing the same challenge to haue ben priuate, or in fevv mens handes, yet novv of late, that I haue seen it in diuerse godly Gentlemens handes, to vvhome it hath bene deliuered by Papistes, be like to peruert them, and of vvhome also I haue bene desired to ansvvere it, &amp; am further credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly informed, that the same is in printe, &amp; estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of many ignorant Papistes to be so vnaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svverable, that although it be protested by Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of great vvorshippe and credit, that they haue seene the aunsvvere thereof in vvriting, yet they vvill not beleue, that any man dare set his penne to the paper, once to attempt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I haue thought beste to putte it in printe as it vvas vvritten at the first. Nothing doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by Gods helpe, but I shalbe able to stande to that defence if the challenger vvill proceede to
<pb facs="tcp:2890:5"/>
meinteine his challenge any longer. That I haue copled it vvith the aunsvvere vnto <hi>M. Allens booke,</hi> is because I doe greatly suspect, that he vvas the authour thereof, for the similitude of the stiles and of the stomakes in both, at the least I trust I doe him no vvronge, to suppose him to be so stout a champion. And thus I committe the Christian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the direction of Gods spirite vvho voutsalfe to lead thee into all truth for Christes sake. Amen.</p>

               <head>The first article conteyneth 3. demandes.</head>
               <q>1 First I aske of the protestant what Church that was, which conuerted all these cuntries that be now Christian, to the faith of Christ?</q>
               <p>IF you meane by Christians, true Christians, and by the faith of Christ, the true faith of Christ, I answere: only the true Church of Christ, hath had the worde of God and sacraments, as meanes which God vseth, to subdue al na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vnto the obedience of the faith, as was the primitiue Church of the Apostles, which hath continued vnto this daye by succession, not of personnes, and places, but of faith and truth, wherefore if the Papist can proue, that we holde not the same faith and trueth, vnto which the Apostles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the nations, we refuse to be called the Church or Congregation of Christ.</p>
               <p>But if by Christians and Christian faith, you meane all them that professe the name of Christ, in the whole worlde, I aunswere, that the true Church of Christ, did not conuert them all, for in Aethiopia, there are yet people, conuerted by the false apostles, which taught circumcision, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the lawe, in which heresie they continue vnto this day, and it is manifest by all histories, that the nations of the Alanes, Gothes, and Vandales, were first conuerted by the Arrians.</p>
               <q>2 And let him shew vnto me, that euer his Church conuerted any people, or lande in the earth, from Idolatrie, or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, or Iudaisme, to the true Religion of Christ, or that this his fayth was taught to any Nation in steede of true Christianity.</q>
               <p>WE are members of that Church, which conuerted all landes in the earth that are conuerted, from Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2890:7"/>
Gentility, Iudaisme, or heresie, to the true Religion of Christ, and we affirme that the Apostles taught none other faith in steede of true Christiantie, but that which we hold, as we are readie to proue by the worde of God: And at this daye the most parte of Europe, is conuerted from Idolatrie, heresie, and Antichristianitie, vnto the same true faith, that we mainteine, as in England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Denmarke, Suetia, Bohemia, Polonia, by publike au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, in Spaigne, and Italie, a great numbre vnder perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and tyrannie. Also of the Iewes, no small numbre are conuerted to our religion, since the rising vp of the Gospell in our dayes.</p>
               <q>3 Or any Church, but the common Catholike Church to haue don that, and I recant.</q>
               <p>BEcause you meane by the common Catholike, not the true Catholike, but the popish church: First I denie that euer the popish church conuerted any people, to the true faith. Secondly, I denie that the popish church hath conuerted all nations, to the profession of Christ: For, it is shewed before, that the false Apostles, and Arians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted some nations to the profession of Christes name, but yet to false religion, And it is also manifest by histories, that the Grecians, whome the papistes counte no parte of their church, but schismatikes, conuerted the Moscouites first of all, vnto the profession of the name of Christ, which yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their religion, being neither the true faith, nor yet popish religion. As for the popish church, as it is certeine, that it hath peruerted and corrupted all partes of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, or Westerne Church, with Idolatry and false religion, so it shalbe harde for the papistes to proue, that it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted any Nation from Gentility to the popish religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept some partes of Germanie, and them by force of armes, rather than by preaching, and reaching, as appeareth by the conuersion of <hi>Liuonia, Anno Domini</hi> 1200. of <hi>Prussia, Anno Domini</hi> 1254. and <hi>of Lithuania, Anno Domini</hi> 1386. wherefore I conclude that seeing I haue shewed that our Church, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2890:8"/>
the true doctrine of the Apostles, is that which conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all nations to true religion, and that the popish church, hath not conuerted any people to true religion, nor all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the profession of the name of Christ, this chalenger, whosoeuer he be, do the recant.</p>

               <head>The second article conteyneth 4. demandes.</head>
               <q>1 I aske of him what Church it was, which hath induced the Christian people through the whole worlde, to geue most humble credit in all points, to the holy bookes of the Byble?</q>
               <p>I Aunswere, it was the Church of Christ, and not the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish church, which hath commended the bookes of holy Scripture, to be beleued of all true Christians where so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be, although it be the office of the holy Ghost, to open the hartes of men, and to forme them that they may beleue the scripture to be true, like as it is the office of the scripture or worde of God, to trie and examine, whether it be the spirite of God that perswadeth vs to beleue any thing, so the spirite beareth witnesse to the worde and the worde to the spirite. As for the popish church it coulde not induce the Christian people to geue credit to the scripture in all pointes, because she is contrarie to the scripture in many pointes: and euen in the cheefest pointes of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, namely in pointes concerning the glorie of God, and the saluation of mankinde, geuing the glory of God to dead men, and dumbe Images, and denying the mercy of God, pourchased by the onely sacrifice of Christes death, to be the onely cause of mans saluation. Finally seeing it is manifest by the aunswere to the first article, that the popish church did not conuerte all nations, to the profession of the Christian faith, it is euident thereby, that the popish church did not induce all them, that are called Christians, to geue credit to the bookes of the holy Bible, as this chalenger woulde haue it to be thought.</p>
               <q>2 VVhat Church hath had the discerning &amp; seuering of them from other writinges of all sortes?</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:2890:8"/>THe Church of Christ, hath not an absolute authority to allow or refuse bookes of the scripture, but a iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to discerne true writinge from counterfaicts, &amp; the word of God, of infallible verity, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> writing of men, which might erre, &amp; this iudgement she hath, not of her selfe, but of the holy Ghost: as for the popish Church, it can not be said to haue this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of discerning the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of God from other writings, not only because she is so blind that she can not discerne betwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Canonical bookes of the scripture, from the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> writings, as appereth by receauing the bookes of the Machabees, Ecclesiasticus, &amp;c. to be of equall authoritie with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bookes of the Law, Psalmes, &amp;c. but also because she is so presumptuous, as to compel men to beleue, that Customes, and traditions, writinges of doctors, decrees of Popes, and Councells, are equall with the authoritie of God his worde, yea are of force, to alter and change the lawe of God, and the institution of Christ, set forth vnto vs in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scripture. And although she boast that she receaueth all the bookes of scripture, yet this proueth no more that she is the Church of Christ, than was the churches of the Arrians, Donatistes, Nouatians, Euthychans, &amp; other heretikes, which receiued the Bible, as well as the Popish church.</p>
               <q>3 VVhat Church hath had the custodie of them, and most safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath preserued them, for the necessary vse of God his people, and from the corruption of aduersaries, as well of Iewes, as heretikes of all sortes?</q>
               <p>THe prouidence of God, hath alwayes preserued the Scripture, both from the violence of tyrants, &amp; from the falshoode of heretikes, and hath neuer suffred the true Church, to be destitute of the necessarie vse thereof. But the popish church, hath not kept the scripture for the necessary vse of the people, which hath so kept it in an vnknowen tongue, that the people coulde haue no vse, much lesse the necessary vse thereof: wherefore if this be a note of the Catholike Church, to kepe the worde of God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2890:9"/>
for the necessarie vse of God his people, it is plaine that the popish church is not the Catholike Church, which hath kept the scripture so, that God his people coulde haue no vse thereof.</p>
               <p>And if the only custodie of the scripture from corruption of heretikes, be a sure note of the Church, why is not the Greeke Church, the Catholike Church, which vnto this day hath kept the scripture as safely as the popish church? why are not other Estern Churches of Asia, which neuer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Pope, or popish religion, true Churches, which likewise haue preserued the scripture, as we haue seen of late, that the newe Testament is printed in the Syrian tongue, at themperours charges, for the encrease of Christian faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And finally, why are not the Iewes, the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, which haue kept the old Testament in Hebrue, more faithfully than euer the Papistes. And because they boast of safe preseruing of the scriptures, all men, that are learned in the tongues can testifie, in how corrupt a Latin translation they haue kept the scriptures, both of the olde and of the new Testament.</p>
               <q>4 And let the Protestant declare to me, that their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath had from time to time, or euer had right herein, or any other Church, sauing the Catholike Church, and I recant.</q>
               <p>OVr Congregation, which is the body of Christ, hath euer had, both right and possession of the inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treasure of the word of Christ her heade: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by this, that our Church and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beleueth nothing but that she learneth in it, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that all thinges profitable to saluation, are sufficiently conteined in it, and finally in all thinges submitteth her selfe to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of it. But the popish church, which beleueth many thinges contrarie to the scripture, teacheth many thinges beside the scripture, necessary to saluation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth to haue her faith, doctrine, and ceremonies, to be iudged by the scripture, neither hath, neither euer had, any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2890:9"/>
right to the scripture, though she haue neuer so many bookes of them in possession. Wherefore these thinges considered, this chalenger doth recant.</p>

               <head>The third article conteyneth 5. demandes.</head>
               <q>1 Shew me why our common knowen Church, did not as well corrupt the text of the Testament, as the true religion conteyned in the same?</q>
               <p>THere may be diuers good reasons shewed, why your Church, commonly knowen to be the church of Antichrist, did not as well corrupt the text of the Testament, as the true religion conteined therein. First, because she coulde not, the copies thereof being so many, by the prouidence of God dispersed throughout the worlde. Secondly, because she thought it not so needefull, hauing other meanes to worke her deuilish deuise: For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she coulde not corrupt the scripture, yet it made the lesse matter, because she founde meanes to diminish, and controll the authority therof by aduancing decrees of men, Popes, and Councells, to be equall or of greater authoritie than the scripture. Thirdly, because she woulde be lesse in feare, to be reproued by the scripture, she prouided that the knowledge thereof, shoulde be hidden from the vnlearned people by a strange tongue, and from the learned, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious mazes of questions, deuised by her Canonistes, and Sententiaries. Fourthly, because she submitted all interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the scripture, to her owne iudgement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore woulde not be controlled by the iudgement thereof, but woulde alwayes expound it, as it liked her best. As ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by <hi>Ockam,</hi> and <hi>Duns,</hi> who though they confesse, that transubstantiation, seemeth to them, contrary to the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reason, yet they beleued it, because of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the church, and for none other cause. These are the reasons, why the Romish church did not, as well corrupt the text of the Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as the true Religion. And yet how cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt that Latine translation is, which they woulde needes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2890:10"/>
thrust vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, is sufficiently knowen to all learned men, euen in such texts, as are the most coulerable places for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Popish doctrine. I will geue one example for all: They alleage the text 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Qui stat, videat ne cadat.</hi> He that standeth, let him take heede he fall not, against the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainetie of faith, whereas the Greeke hath, not he that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, but, he that thinketh he standeth, let him take heede he fall not: Thus the popish church cannot altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse her selfe, from corrupting of the text of the Testament, whether it was of fraude, or of ignorance, or of negligence, the Lorde knoweth.</p>
               <q>2 Shew me why, she kept not so safely, and faithfully, the true sense of God his word, as she preserued the word it selfe?</q>
               <p>BEcause it was against her owne estimation, and profit, which are the chiefe endes for which popish Prelates mainteyne popish religion. Take away the Popes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue, which is contrary to the sense of God his word, downe goe Cardinalls, Legates, Prothonotaries: downe goeth all the Court of Rome, take away workes of superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which are contrary to the Scripture, downe goe Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beys, Priories and Chantries. Take away the sacrifice of the Masse, &amp; Purgatory, which are contrary to the word of God, downe goeth the estimation, and gaynes of all the popish clergie: And this is the cause, why the popish church kept not so safely, and faithfully, the true sense of God his word, as she preserued the word it selfe, although she preserued not the word it self, in such safetie as becommed the Church of Christ.</p>
               <q>3 Shew me why, we should beleue the Papistes, as you terme them, for the word it self, and rather you Protestants tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, for the meaning of the word.</q>
               <p>WE doe not chalenge credit to our selues, in any poynt, so presumptuously as the Papistes, that men must beleue it because we affirme it. But because we proue it to be true, by the worde of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2890:10"/>
God. And therefore for the meaning of the word, you should beleue vs rather than them, because our groundes &amp; proues are better then theirs, or else we require not to be beleued better than they.</p>
               <q>4 Shew me why, you beleued our Church, telling you this to be God his booke, &amp; will not credit her, auouching this to be the true and vndoubted sense of the same booke?</q>
               <p>IF we had no better ground to perswade vs, of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of God his booke, than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> testimony of your Church, you may be sure we would not beleue it. But because we haue most stedfast assurance of God his spirite, for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that booke, with the testimony of the true Church in all ages. If you say it is God his booke, we beleue you not, because you say so, but because we know it to be true. But if you bring out a false sense, we beleue you not, because we know it to be false, &amp; are able to proue by the word of God, that it is contrary to the meaning of the holy Ghost. To be plaine with you, we geue as much credit to your Church, as to the deuill. When the deuill sayth: it is written: <hi>He shall giue his angells charge ouer thee, and with their handes they shall hold thee vp that thou dash not thy foote against a stone.</hi> We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue that this is the worde of God. But when he auoucheth this to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meaning of it, that we may cast downe our selues from a Church steeple, without daunger, we doe not beleue him, because we know this sense is contrary to an other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which sayth: <hi>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> So when you say these wordes are the Scripture of God: <hi>This is my body:</hi> We beleue it, because we knowe it to be true. But when you say this is the meaning of these wordes. <hi>This bread is turned into my naturall bodye,</hi> we beleue you not, because it is contrary to all places of Scripture, which proue the trueth of Christ his humanitie or naturall body. Thus I shewe you why we beleue you, if you say the Scripture is God his word, namely because we know it to be true, &amp; why we beleue you not, saying this is the meaning of it, that is, because we knowe by the word of God that it is false.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:2890:11"/>
               <q>5 Last of all, Shew me why, you beleued the olde known church, affirming this to be the word of God, and will not beleue her, affirming Luther to be an heretike, shew me good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Scripture for these thinges, and I recant.</q>
               <p>IF you meane by the olde Church the primitiue Church, whose testimony of the word of God we allow &amp; beleue, I deny that the primitiue Church did affirme <hi>Luther</hi> to be an heretike, or the doctrine that he taught, which we hold,, to be heresie, but I am able to proue, that the primitiue Church, from which you haue receiued the Scripture, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth your doctrine to be heresie, &amp; your Church y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>But if by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old knowne Church, you meane the Church of old, knowne to be the Church of Antichrist, which is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish church,, we beleue the deuill if he speake the trueth, and we beleue not an Angell comming from heauen, if he bring any other Gospel, than <hi>S. Paule</hi> deliuered to the Galathians. Therefore when your church affirmeth <hi>Luther</hi> to be an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, seeing we know that <hi>Luther</hi> did not obstinately, and malitiously erre, in any article of faith, concerning the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of religion, we doe not beleue her: and specially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is a partiall witnesse against him, whome God vsed to discouer, so much of her wickednesse, to her great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, there is no credit to be geuen vnto her, when she goeth about to deface him, by sclaunderous names, and false accusations. Thus I haue shewed these thinges that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, both by good reason, and also by scripture: Therefore if I may beleue you, you recant.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> vpon <hi>Luke cap.</hi> 16. sayeth, that the ignorance of the scriptures, hath bred heresies, and brought in corrupt life, yea it hath turned all things vpsidown, by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, by what meanes he would haue heresies kept away, namely by knowledge of the scriptures.

And therefore they become, maisters of error, because they haue not bene schollers of trueth. Of the same iudgement was the whole Councell of Constantinople the sixt, as appeare <hi>Actione</hi> 18. <hi>Si igitur omnes simpliciter &amp;c.</hi> Therefore if all men from the beginning woulde haue simply and without subtiltie taken vpon them the preaching of the Gospell, and haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the constitutions of the Apostles, suerly matters shoulde haue bene well, and in good case, neither shoulde painefull contention, haue bene exercised against the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of heresies, nor against the fauorers of priests. Here the Councell confesseth, that the heretikes and schismatikes grow so fast, because they were not beaten downe, by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell and authority of the scriptures. Thus I haue declared by example, and authority of these Fathers, that the true Church of Christ, hath conuicted all heretikes, onely by the scripture.</p>
               <q>2 And what Church it was, that hath alwayes stande still, and stedfast, whilest all other Congregations, as well of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, as Anabaptistes, Aerians, Nouatians, Vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Iouinians, and the rest haue decaied.</q>
               <p>THe true Church of Christ, hath alwayes stoode sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast, and vnseparable, from Christ her heade, when all heretikes haue bene, and shal be confounded. But the true Church hath not alwaies florished in word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peace and tranquilitie: for vntill the tyme of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, which was <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 339. the Church had small rest from cruell persecution in most places: and soone after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnder the Emperors <hi>Constantius, Constans,</hi> and <hi>Valens,</hi> it was greatly infected with the heresie of <hi>Arius,</hi> what time also <hi>Tiberius</hi> Bishop of Rome, was infected with the same heresie.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2890:14"/>
After that when <hi>Iulianus</hi> the <hi>Apostata,</hi> was Emperor, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Idolls were opened, and gentilitie againe restored, so that the Church suffered great detriment. To be short, when the barbarous Goathes, Vandales, Alanes, and other Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous or heretical nations destroyed the Empire, the Church of God suffered a great Ecclipse. But when <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in the East, &amp; Antichrist the Pope, in the West, seduced the world with most detestable heresie, then was fulfilled that which was reuealed to <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the 12. of the <hi>Apocalyps, the woman clothed with the Sonne,</hi> which you your self confesse to be the Church, <hi>was so persecuted by the Dragon, that she fled into the wildernes, there to remaine a long season.</hi> Where she hath not decayed, but ben always preserued, vntil God should reueale Antichrist, and bring her againe into open light, which (his holy name be praysed) is now brought to passe in our dayes, to our inestimable comfort, and his euerlasting glory.</p>
               <q>3 And if it can be proued that either the Protestants Church or any other Church but ours, hath mightely ouerthrowne these foresayd sectes, and other of all sortes, I recant.</q>
               <p>IT hath bene already proued sufficiently, that the true Catholike Church which is ledde onely, by the worde of God, as a most infallible rule, hath ouerthrowne heresies of all sortes. But the popish church which refuseth the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weapon, by which heresies are cut downe, to be sufficient for that purpose, neuer was nor shall be strong enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with heretikes, therefore she practiseth to vanquish those whom she counteth for heretikes, not by authoritie of the Scriptures, but by fire and sworde, and cruell warre, as appeareth by her dealing with the Waldenses, Albigenses, Bohemians, and in our dayes with the true Christians. But where her power of fire and sword could not preuayle, there hath she not ouerthrowne such as she condemneth for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, namely the Grecians church, &amp; all other churches of Asia, and Aphrica, which vnto this day will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her doctrine to be Catholike, nor her authoritie to be lawefull. Wherefore seeing the Popish church neither

               <p>THe Church of Christ only, hath had lawful authority to exercise discipline: but as it is said before, she hath not continually practised the same, because she could not, being hindered by persecution, and dispersion. Concerning excommunication, she hath practised it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word of God, and against such offendors, as the scripture iudgeth worthy of that seuere punishment: As for degradation, and suspension, it may be doubted what you meane by them: If you vnderstand by degradation, that such persons as the Church hath tried vnmeet, either for doctrine or manners, to execute the office of preaching, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the sacraments, she hath displaced and reiected from that charge: she hath also practised drgradation: And if you meane by suspension, that when the accusation of a mans doctrine or life was vncerteine, that she hath willed him to cease from executing his office, vntill his cause were tried either good or euill, she hath also vsed suspension: but if by degradation and suspension, you meane those foolish and wicked ceremonies, which the popish church now vseth and so termeth, I deny that euer the true Church of Christ had to do with such degradations and suspensions.</p>

               <p>IT is proued before, that true discipline belongeth to the true Church, wherof we are a part, which Church is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proued to be the spouse of Christ, because she is ruled in all thinges by his onely voice: And therefore all congregations of heretikes, which departe from the true worde of God, though they take vpon them, to exercise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, by excommunication or otherwise, it is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and lest of all the Popish church, where remaineth nothing of discipline and excommunication, but the very names: for what call you popish discipline? is not that it which they vse in Lent, whisking men on the heades, and women on the handes, with white roddes which they them selues call discipline? Or is it the seuere punishment that they vse against offendors by excommunication, suspension, interdighting &amp;c. First, it is manifest they haue no excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication by Christes appointment, for neither it is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the persons appointed by Gods worde, nor against such offendors only as God his word appointeth: for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Sauiour Christ appointeth the order of that discipline, to the Congregation of such as are wise, godly, and carefull of mens health, which first shal labor by fatherly admonition and wholesome exhortation, to bring the offendors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whome if they refuse to heare, they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for hethens and publicanes, the Pope contrariwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth the same to profane and vnreligious officers, which are more desirous to gaine the fees of absolution, than by bringing the party to repentance, to saue him from excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Moreouer whereas by Gods worde, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is the last and most greuous punishment, that the Church can enioyne against any, of whom there is any hope of saluation, and therefore ought not to be practised but for haynous offences, the Popish church maketh it serue for euery trifling matter, yea for pettie debts and all, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in interdightings &amp; suspensions of places, as churches

and townes, yea whole realmes, for one mans faulte: what likelinesse hath this vnto the discipline of Christes church set forth in the scriptures, and practised by the fathers? with what face can you Papistes affirme, they haue discipline, in their Church, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all penaunces for most horrible offences, may be bought out for money, and an open market thereof set vp at Rome, with the prices rated, what men must pay for euery thing that they buye: as absolution for him that hath killed his father, or mother, brother, sister, or wife Turones 4.

Where he also saith. <hi>Quare honoramus eos cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate, non seruitute.</hi> We honor them with loue, and not with seruice. And as he doth often affirme, that it is Idolatry to builde churches in the honour of Sainctes, so is it as great Idolatry, to institute festiuall dayes, in the fauour of the same Sainctes. As for the festiuall dayes that were vsed in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, although they might haue bene omitted, without any hurt of Christian Religion, yet were they not kept in the honour of creatures, as they are of the Papistes, but only for the memorie of the Martyrs, and other Saincts, that their good life might be followed.

doth great iniury to the Sainctes of God, first, because she doth not so accompt them while they liue, and secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she referreth the canonization of them only to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, who not for their holy life, maketh them Sainctes, but for the holy honger of golde, as appeare by Pope <hi>Iuly</hi> 2. who woulde not canonize king Henry the sixt, at the request of king Henry the seuenth, vnder an vnreasonable summe of money. If that summe of money had bene paide, he shoulde haue bene a sainct, though he had not deserued, not for his vertue. And because that summe of money was not paide, he might not be canonized, although his godlinesse neuer so much deserued. Againe of what force your Canonization is to be esteemed, we may learne by a fact of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. who condemned, digged vp, and burned the bodie of <hi>Hermannus in Ferraria,</hi> 30. yeares after his buriall, who had bene worshipped for a sainct aboue 20. yeares before, as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth <hi>Platina</hi> and other. <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth canonized Pope <hi>Liberius,</hi> which was an Arrian, as <hi>S.

Marke, Luke, Timothe, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabus, Epaphras, &amp;c. Iustinus, Irenaeus, Cyprianus, Athanasius, Hylarius, Ambrosius, Augustinus, &amp;c. Gyldas, Bertramus, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius de Padua. Ioan. de Ganduno, Bruno Andagauensis VVick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, Iohn Hus, Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prage, &amp;c.</hi> With the first, namely Apostles, Euangelistes, and Prophets, we consent wholly in all pointes of doctrine, with the rest, in the cheefe and most substantiall articles of faith, alwayes agreeing with any man, so farre as he agreeth with the worde of God.</p>
               <q>3 And if he can proue vnto me, that their Church hath neuer lacked the same appointed officers, or that any Church or Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but ours hath kept that charge, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I recant.</q>
               <p>FOr some of those officers I haue twise aunswered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that they were not ordeined, to continue alwaies, with the church, wherefore they are not to be exacted

of vs, but such officers as are necessary for the conseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God his people in the vnitie of faith and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, our Church hath neuer lacked, although in time of the great defection and Apostasie whereof <hi>S. Paule</hi> doth prophesie 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. there were but few, as there were but fewe members of Christ his Church notwithstanding that through iniurie of the time, the remembraunce of all their names is not come vnto vs. And although we could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse in order as many successions in our Church as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes boast of in theirs, yet were that nothing to proue it to be the Church of Christ, which must be tried onely by the Scriptures, as <hi>S. Augustine</hi> sayth in his booke <hi>de vnitate Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae,</hi> against the Donatistes <hi>cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Sed vtrum ipsi Ecclesiam te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neant, non nisi diuinarum Scripturarum canonicis libris ostendant, quia nec nos propterea dicimus nobis credere oportere quod Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia sumus, quia ipsam quam tenemus commendauit Mileuitanus Optatus, vel Mediolanensis Ambrosius, vel alij innumerabiles no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strae communionis Episcopi, &amp;c.</hi> But whether they holde the Church or no, let them shew none otherwise, but by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall bookes of holy Scripture, for we our selues doe not therefore say that men must beleeue vs that we are in the Church because we hold the same Churche, which <hi>Optatus</hi> of Mileuitum hath commended, or <hi>Ambrose</hi> of Millayn, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Bishops of our communion. Euen so we require at the Papistes handes that shewe them selues to holde the Church not by succession of Bishops, or rehearsing of their names, but onely by the Scriptures: for although we did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse innumerable names of Bishops in orderly succession on our side we would not require men to beleue vs, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because we proue the doctrine of our Church by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Scriptures. But as for the popish church, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath nor euer had any of those officers which <hi>S. Paule</hi> speaketh of, for Apostles, Euangelistes, and Prophets, she can chalenge by no reason, seing she refuseth to be tried by their doctrine vttered in their writings, in steede of pastors &amp; tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers she hath wolues, du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me dogges, or false prophets, which either teach not at all, or else teach the doctrine of deuills &amp; the dreames of men. And further I would desire none other

place in all the Scripture, to ouerthrow the popish Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie (which is the greatest glory of their Church) then this place of <hi>Paule, Ephes.</hi> 4. he speaketh of Apostles, Euangelists, Prophets, Pastors and teachers. But where are Popes, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls, popish archbishops, Bishops, Preestes, Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Exorcistes, Cantors, Acolyts, Ostiares, Monkes, Friars, Chano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Nunnes, &amp;c. Wherfore I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that all these po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish orders are no offices in the Church of Christ. And espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, seeing the Apostle both in this place <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. by these offices proueth the vnitie of minde, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth no Pope as one supreme head in earth, which might be very profitable (as the Papists say) to mainteine this vnity: for if there had bene any such office appoynted of God, <hi>S. Paule</hi> in no wise woulde haue omitted it, especially when it made so notably for the confirmation of his purpose, which was vnitie. To conclude if it be sufficient, or any thing worth, to rehearse the names of them that haue orderly succeded in all ages in the bishops sees, in an outwarde face of the Church, the Greeke Church is able to name as many as the Latine Church, and in as orderly succession. Wherefore if you be as ready to performe as to promise, you recant.</p>

               <q>1 Moreouer I aske whether for all these many hundreth of yeares or euer els before there was any temporall Prince or Potentate, that offered to be vnder God a minister of Iustice and an executor of Christian lawes in the right of your Congregation, that euer maintained by lawes Ciuill or other, your Faith and Congregation, and I recant.</q>
               <p>BEfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> general defection, it is an easy matter, to name you the Emperours and Princes which both offered, to be ministers of Iustice in the right of our church, and also mainteyned our faith and Congregation, by Ciuill lawes, as <hi>Constantine</hi> the greate, <hi>Iouinianus, Valentinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Theodosius, Archadius, Honorius, Marcianus, Iustinianus, Mauricius,</hi> and diuers other. But when the kinges of the earth had committed fornication with the great whore of Babylon (as the holy Ghost foresheweth <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. and 18.) it is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice to our cause if we can not shew, any of them that haue mainteined our Religion. Yet because you make so gentle an offer vpon the triall of such a matter, which is of small force either to the hurt of our cause or the maintenance of yours, I will let you vnderstande what I haue reade for this purpose. Not doubting but other which haue reade much more, and seene more auncient histories than I, can shew you a great deale more. I passe ouer as to well knowen, how many of the Grecian Emperors resisted the setting vp of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, in so much that in the Greeke church to this daye they can abide none in their temples, likewise I passe ouer <hi>Charles</hi> the great, who wrote a booke against Images, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2890:23"/>
is in printe, who also declared, that he liked not the heresie of the reall presence and transubstantiation, which in his time was in forging, in that he called <hi>Bertrame,</hi> to declare his minde of that matter, as appeareth by his booke, which is also in printe. I will not rehearse those princes, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Popes lawes, defended their priestes, that were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: For although these and such like defended some parte of the trueth, which we holde against you, yet lest you should obiect, it was but in some one or two pointes, I passe them ouer with silence. But <hi>VVickleue,</hi> I wene, you will not deny, but he was of our Church and Religion. And I reade that king <hi>Edward</hi> the third, both in his Parliament holden <hi>Anno Domini,</hi> 1371. and at other times with diuers other noble men defended his cause: in so much that so long as he liued, all the popish byshops, coulde do him no harme, yet did he openly inueigh against the Pope, calling him Antichrist, and all popish doctrine without any couller or dissimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both in the vniuersitie of Oxeford, where he was reader, and also in his sermons abroade, as appeareth by his bookes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish homilies, which yet are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to be seene, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnlesse he had bene supported, and maintained by the kinge and other potentates, coulde neuer haue continued so long as he did.

For what cause did <hi>Paule</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Anno Domini,</hi> 1466. condemne <hi>George,</hi> a noble and a worthy Prince, king of Bohemia for an heretike? and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him of his kingdome? was it not for defending the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes in his dominion?

               <p>I Answer, euen in the Apostles time, there arose many he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies which did not a litle trouble the Church, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after the Apostles time, while the fathers of the church were earnestly occupied, in resisting of horrible heresies, by the craft of Satan, some errors and abuses crept into the true Church of Christ, which at the first because they were small, and men occupied in greater matters, were either not espied, or not regarded: as may be knowen by the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of <hi>Iustinus</hi> Martyr, and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> two of the most aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers, sence the Apostles time. <hi>Iustinus,</hi> was in this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that he thought that the Angells lusted after women and therefore were turned into Deuills. It seemeth also, that the Church in his time, was in some error, about second ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and diuorcements. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> affirmeth, that our Sauiour Christ liued here 50. yeares, which he sayeth was receyued of them that heard it, euen of the Apostles mouthes. Also both he and <hi>Papias,</hi> which was before him and was the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>S. Iohn</hi>: are charged by <hi>S. Ieronym, in Catalogo Script. Eccl.</hi> to haue held this error, that Christ should raigne a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares after the Resurrection here in the flesh, whereby it is manifest, seeing these auncient fathers, and pillers of the Church were thus stayned with errors, that the Church in their time, could not be free from the same.

By this Canon, it is euident, that at this time, the people vnderstood the Latine tongue, though it were very rude and rustical. And where the Canon prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the same homilies to be translated either into the rude latine tongue, or into the Theotisce tongue. Although this word <hi>Theotisca,</hi> seeme to be corrupted, yet it is most certeine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2890:26"/>
that they meant Dutch tongue, for as much as <hi>Carolus mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> had a great part of Germanie vnder his dominion, and the Germanes, as neuer throughly subdued by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, neuer throughly receiued the latine tongue. Yet it is manifest, that they vnderstoode their common prayer in the latine tongue, though not perfectly, because the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non sayth: <hi>Quo facilius &amp;c.</hi> That all men may more easely vnderstand, signifying that they vnderstood the pure latine tongue though hardely and not perfectly. About the yeare of our Lorde 813. the knowledge of the latine tongue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne more and more to weare awaye, from amongest the common people, which when the bishops perceiued, they decreed in the Councell of Magunce, <hi>cap.</hi> 25. that euery Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye, and holy daye, there shoulde be a sermon in such sorte, that the common people might vnderstand it: and in the 45. Canon. they decreed, that euery Christian, shoulde learne the Creede, and the Lorde his prayer, <hi>Et qui aliter non potue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, vel in sua lingua hoc discat,</hi> that is, And he that can not, yet let him learne it in his owne tongue. Whereby they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they desier to reteine the latine tongue still, but rather than the people shoulde be ignorant, they commande them to learne their prayers and beleefe in their mother tongue. Also by the 43. Canon, wherein they iudge that no preeste can saye Masse alone, it appeareth that the people commonly vnderstood the latine seruice: for they aske how he shoulde saye: <hi>Dominus vobiscum,</hi> and admonish the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to lifte vp their heartes, and diuers like sayinges, where there is none by him but him selfe. Nowe if the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode not these sayinges, it were all one, whether they were present or absent. Also in the Councell of Rhenes, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Fraunce about the same time, the like decree was made <hi>cap.</hi> 15. that bishops studie to preache sermons, and homelies of the holy fathers so that all men maye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, according to the property of their tongue. Finally in the Councell of Laterane holden vnder Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1215. in which Councell transubstantiation was first established, the 9. chapter, it was plainely decreed that forasmuch as within one citie and diocesse people of

diuers languages be mingled together, hauing vnder one Faith, diuers rites, and maners, we streightly commande, that the bishops of such cities and diocesses, prouide able men, which according to the diuersitie of their rites, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, celebrate vnto them, the diuine seruice, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the sacramentes, instructing them both by worde and example. Hereby it appeareth, that when the latine tongue, was either almost, or altogether growen out of the common peoples vnderstandings, order was taken that common pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers should be sayed and sacramentes ministred in the mother tongue of euery nation. But the bishops which shoulde haue seene it put in execution, either negligently omitted it, or willingly refused to doe it, because it was more for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to kepe the people in blinde ignorance. So thus I haue shewed, that sodenly the tongue of common prayer, was not altered.</p>

               <p>BEfore you demande what yeare the religion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes came, in and whether it came in sodenly: and as though we shoulde aunswere that it came in sodaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you demande, who preached against it &amp;c. This is to fight with your owne shadowe: for we say not that it came in sodainely, but that it entred by small degrees at the first and therefore was lesse espied by the true Pastors, especially being earnestly occupied against great heresies, and open aduersaries, that sought to beate downe the cheefe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christian faith, as the Valentinians, Marcionistes, Manichees, Arrians, Sabellians, and such like monsters.

               <q>12 If it coulde not, shew me then what yeare of the Lorde this mutation was made, and who of all the true preachers did with stand this doctrine?</q>
               <p>SO often as you demande one thinge, so often must I aunswere after one sorte, this mutation was not all in one yeare, nor in one hundreth yeares, nor in one thousand of yeares, for transubstantiation no small ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of your religion, was not decreed vntill the yeare of God 1215. what preachers haue withstoode your doctrine at diuers times are declared before in the aunswere to the 8.

against the former receyued trueth and the Councells in which they were orderly condemned if I, saye this can be done of your side towarde vs, or if we doe it not for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of your Church and religion, I recant.</q>
               <p>I Haue noted in the answere to the 6. article 3. demande, the names of diuers heretikes, that first preached diuers articles of your religion, and further I note vnto you <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius,</hi> and <hi>Coelestius,</hi> which tought that free will without grace coulde doe somewhat towardes eternall saluation, and that grace was geuen according to merite, which article you teach also with culler of a distinction <hi>De congruo &amp; condigno,</hi> which is a meere cauill: for God is as much bounde vnto congruitie, as to dignitie or worthinesse, and as he can doe nothing against worthinesse, no more can he doe any thing against congruitie, which is a kinde of Equitie. And whereas you bragge, to note vnto vs euery one of our Capitaines &amp;c. except you note vnto vs the Patriarches, Prophets, Apostles, Euangelistes, and Christ himselfe, you shall neuer be able to performe that you promise, for we teache nothing but the eternall trueth of God, wherefore we refuse not to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heretikes, if you can proue, that we holde any one arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of faith, contrarie to the scripture: you may perchaunce note the names of them, that preaching the trueth of our doctrine, against your receyued errors, were accounted of the world for heretikes, but you must proue that their opinions are contrarie to the worde of God, or els all your labour is in vaine: we confesse also, that some articles of our doctrine, were taught by heretikes, as there was neuer no heresie, which had not many thinges common with true Religion, but yet in those poinctes they were no heretikes, neither did they erre. Yea but you will saye, they were condemned for those opinions, as erroneous. I will not dissemble, that which you thinke the greatest matter. <hi>Aerius</hi> tought, that prayer for the deade was vnprofitable, as witnesseth both <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>Augustinus,</hi> which they compte for an error, but neither of them both, reproueth it by the scripture. Wherefore, if <hi>Aerius</hi> had not bene an Arrian, this opinion coulde not haue
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2890:28"/>
made him an heretike. Also he tought that fasting dayes are not to be obserued, if he espied the superstition of fasting dayes and reproued it, that was no error at all. But if <hi>Aerius</hi> was an heretike, for denying prayer for the deade to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, why were the <hi>Heracleonites,</hi> accused of heresie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they buried their deade with inuocations <hi>Epiph. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>Haeres.</hi> 36. <hi>Augustine,</hi> also by authoritie of <hi>Philaster</hi> chargeth the same <hi>Aerius,</hi> with abstinence from flesh, if this be an heresie, then be all Papistes heretikes, which compte abstinence from flesh an holy fast. Againe you will bring in <hi>Iouiniane,</hi> which affirmed that virginitie was no better than mariage, which if it be well vnderstoode, is no error at all: for although virginitie in some cases and respectes, and for some persons is better than mariage: yet is it not simply, that is in all respectes and cases, and for all persons better than matrimonie. And if he tought further that such as coulde not conteine, though they had vowed Virginitie, shoulde neuerthelesse be maried, this was the doctrine of <hi>S. Paule</hi>: It is better to marry than to burne. And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was of the same iudgement, although he compte it an offence to marrie after their vowe, yet he sayeth: It is better to marry then to burne. <hi>Melius est itaque vnum peccatum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere, &amp; non plura, &amp;c.</hi> It is better to haue one offence, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then many. It is better for him that is fallen from his course, openly to take a wife according to the lawe, and to repent longe time that vowe of his virginitie, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine be brought into the Church, as one that hath done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, as one that is fallen and broken, and hauing neede to be bound: rather then to be wounded daily, with priuy darts of that wickednes, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuill putteth into him. So know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Church to preach, these are the medicines of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. <hi>Ep. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Haer.</hi> 61. this medicine the popish church wil not acknowledge, but will separate them from their wiues, as they did in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> times. <hi>S. Ieronym</hi> also, who was a most bitter enemy vnto <hi>Iouinian,</hi> plainly affirmeth, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they which haue professed virginitie, shoulde liue incontinently, they ought to marrie. <hi>Sanctum Virginum propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm &amp; coelestis angelorúmque familiae gloriam, quarundam non

To whom must be plainly sayd that either they should marry, if they can not conteyne, or else conteyne if they will not marry. Note well this saying of <hi>S. Ieronym,</hi> the great aduancer of virginitie, and dispraiser of mariage. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer if <hi>Iouinian</hi> taught that fasting, abstinence from certeyne meates, and other bodily exercise of them selues profit litle, his doctrine agreeth with <hi>S. Paul.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. but if he taught (as he is charged) that such thinges profited nothing at all, we agree not with him in that opinion. Last of all <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> shall be brought in, who wrote against inuocation of Saincts, superstition of reliques, and other ceremonies, him <hi>Ieronym</hi> reproueth or rather rayleth on him: for his reasons are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth that he hath against him, therefore howsoeuer <hi>Ieronym</hi> estemed him in his rage, if he had none other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions contrary to the truth: we doubt not to acknowledge <hi>Vigilantius</hi> (as many godly and learned Bishops of his tyme did) for a true preacher and reprehender of that superstition whereunto <hi>Ieronym</hi> was to much addict, although he doe somewhat qualifie the matter.

If the lambe be euery where, therfore they which are with the lambe, are to be thought to be euery where. Beside this euill consequence, consider what perilous assertions these be: that the lambe is euery where, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> martyrs are euery where, this is to destroy the humanitie of Christ, and to giue diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto the Martyrs: for Christ concerning his humanitie, according to which, he is called a Lambe, is not euery where, but in one place alone, as <hi>S.

Ieronym</hi> if he had quietly considered these absurdities, would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked them as erroneous and hereticall: but while he rather followed affection, then iudgement, you may see how he was deceaued. Thus seeing we haue noted to you the names of diuerse heretikes, which first preached certeyne articles of your doctrine, and you are not able to name any, which prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched any article of our doctrine, but the same was consonant to the Scripture.

On the daye called Sonday (sayth he) there is a mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together of all them that dwell in the Citie or in the countrie, and the monumentes of the Apostles, or the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of the Prophetes are reade vntill it be thought suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, when the reader hath made an ende, he that is our ouerseer (or cheefe minister) maketh a sermon of admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exhortation to follow those good thinges that are reade. After this we all stande vp together and make our prayers, and as we haue saide before, when our prayers are ended, there is brought forth bread and wine &amp; water, and the cheefe minister, doth likewise with all his might yelde pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thankesgeuing, and the people aunswereth Amen. Then is made distribution to euery one and receyuing of those thinges for which thankes was geuen, and to them that be absent, it is sent by the deacons. Such as are riche and willing doe geue almes what they will, &amp;c. By this one autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, it may be seene though other might be brought, what order of seruice and ministration of sacraments our Church vsed before Papistry gat the vpper hande.</p>
               <q>2 Shew one booke of Communion or what els you list that was in English, or lacked prayer for the departed, or inuocation of Sainctes in heauen, or that wanted oblation, or sacrifice, or that charged a number to receyue, or els that the preest coulde not consecrate nor say Masse, himselfe, or shew any note in a Communion booke, that the people shoulde take the sacrament for plaine breade, or that they should geue no honor to it, shew this booke or any leafe or line of this booke.</q>
               <p>IT may trouble a wise man to aunswere all the questions that a foole can propounde: you requier to see a booke of Communion in English, or that lacked &amp;c. When it is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2890:30"/>
confessed, that the English nation receiued their religion first from Rome, at such time as Religion there was verie corrupt, what marueill is it, if we can not shewe you such a Communion booke as you require, but we can easily shew you out of the scripture, the the Communion ought to be ministred in the vulgare tongue, that prayer for the deade and to the deade ought not to be vsed, that the sacrament ought not to be turned into a sacrifice, that there ought to be a communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many receauers and not a priuate masse, that the substance of the bread is not changed, that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the sacrament are not to be honored: these I say we can proue out of the worde of God, the Catholike wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the olde Church. And though perchaunce, it wilbe harde to finde a communion booke in English, yet haue I founde you a canon of the Laterane Councell, that it ought to haue bene translated into English, yet are there founde diuers monumentes of Antiquitie, as Prayers, Psalmes, and Homilies, &amp;c. in the olde English or Saxons tongue, in which the reall presence, transubstantiation, and other poinctes of Popish doctrine are plainly confuted. There may be shewed you also Bybles both the olde Testament and New in the English tongue of diuers translations, in olde written hande. Also great bookes of English homilies inueighing directly against the Pope and all Popish doctrine in olde English written hande, with diuers other small treatises and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets of like matters, if these woulde do you any good, you might haue the sight of them, when you please.</p>
               <q>3 Or any Church or Congregation that euer had any Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall seruice but ours, and I recant.</q>
               <p>THe Church of the Brytannes before <hi>Augustine</hi> came in, with Romish seruice, had they not trow you Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall seruice? which continued in the faith of Christ euen from the Apostles time. The Grecians also &amp; Orientall churches, haue they not vnto this day, their Authenticall seruice? which is not yours? If you can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this, you should recant.</p>

               <head>The 13. article hath 2. demaundes.</head>
               <q>1 Furthermore I requier to know what shoulde be the cause that the Protestants them selues, doe receiue all Byshops, Priestes, Deacons, and other officers spirituall of all sortes of our Catholike church, and doe admit them as men law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and sufficiently ordered, both to preach, minister sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and to exercise spirituall iurisdiction no lesse, but rather more, than if they were of their owne ordering, where we of the Catholike church, doe not acknowledge any man of their calling to be any whit more fitte for any spirituall function than other lay men.</q>
               <p>ALthough all godly men wishe more seueritie of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to be vsed, in receyuing them that come out of heresies to serue in the Church, than is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practised in England: yet you are highlie decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if you thinke we esteeme your offices of Bishops, priests, deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, any better than the state of lay men, but farre worse: for we iudge them to be nothing els but Antichristianitie, heresie, and blasphemie. And therefore we receiue none of them to minister in our church, except they forsweare your religion: And so their admission is not an allowing of your ordering, but a new calling vnto the ministerie.</p>
               <q>2 Therefore vpon this presumption that they doe not onely admit our ministring of sacraments, but also the lawfull ordering of the ministers for the same, if they can shew me why our church hauing by their owne consent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing lawfull priestes and bishops should not be the true church, I recant.</q>
               <p>YOu presume to much as I saide before to thinke that we receiue your orderinge to be lawfull or your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring of sacraments to be pure. And if you gather, that we admitte your ministration of sacraments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we doe not rebaptize them that were baptized by you,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2890:31"/>
we maye likewise gather that you admit our ministration of sacraments, because you doe not rebaptize them that are baptized of vs, nor marrie againe those that are married in our Church: wheras you compt mariage to be a sacrament, so that our accepting of your doings doth no more allow your church, than your accepting of our doinges, doth allow our Church. And as touching the sacrament of Baptisme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you reteyne the Institution, in baptizing in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost: and in asmuch as the sacraments take not their effect of the minister, but of God, we receiue it: as of other heretikes which likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the Institution. Wherefore there is no cause why you shoulde thinke we allow yours to be the true Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: So that there is good cause why you shoulde recant.</p>

               <head>The 14. article hath 5. demandes.</head>
               <q>1 Also I demande what furniture or commodity in seruing God the Christianity of any age, or any part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had euer by your Congregations?</q>
               <p>THe seruice of God hath small neede of furniture in outwarde thinges: for God being a spirite, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with outward pompe but with spirituall and inwarde reuerence. And as for other furniture that is necessary, was decreed to the Church by the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> and his successors, that were of our Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antichrist. Notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the Church was in better case, before such furniture was graunted, than it was since. Therefore it is a small reason to chalenge the Church of Christ by outwarde furniture.</p>
               <q>2 VVhat Churches did you builde for your assemblies and seruice?</q>
               <p>OVr assemblies were kept in secret places, long time after Christes Ascension, in most cuntries, that were subiect to the Romane empire. Wherefore the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:2890:32"/>
of materiall churches proueth nothing at all the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be members of the mystical Church, that is the body of Christ. Howbeit in such realmes and cuntries where the faith of Christ, was receiued by publike authoritie, as in this lande of Brytaine, there were churches builded as our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles declare. And when <hi>Constantinus</hi> had geuen peace to the Church: he also builded Oratories and great Synagoges called <hi>Basilicas,</hi> for our assemblies and seruice.</p>
               <q>3 VVhat Bishoprickes for the gouernment of the Church did you finde?</q>
               <p>AS the church continued longe without materiall churches, so also without large possessions, for the lyuing of bishops, yet in Brytish Church our histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries make mention that the possessions and places of the Pagane Flamines, and Archiflamines were conuerted to the vse of Ecclesiastical bishops and archbishops, so soon as <hi>Lucius,</hi> the king receiued the faith. Also the same histories do testifie, that when <hi>Augustine</hi> came into Britayn, there were still 7. bishops and one archbishop among the Britaines. And in the Romane Empier <hi>Constantinus,</hi> and other Christian Emperors appointed great possessions for the mainteyning of the ministers of the Church.</p>
               <q>4 VVhat Vniuersities, Schooles, or Colledges, did you euer erect?</q>
               <p>THe Church of God hath alwayes had schooles, or Vniuersities for the mainteinance of godly learning. For the first Colledges of monkes in solitary places, were nothing els, but Colledges of studentes, that were after, as occasion serued, taken to serue in the Church, as appereth by <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his booke <hi>De Sacerdotio,</hi> where he sheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Basilius,</hi> who was a Monke with him, was taken by violence and made a minister of the church, as he him selfe was afterwarde. Also in the bishops house was a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of studentes: and our histories testifie, that at Bangor, in Wales was a great Vniuersitie of learned men. Also of late
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2890:32"/>
dayes, you may heare that diuerse Vniuersities, Scholes, and Colleges are erected by Protestants, in Germanie, and other contries that haue receiued the gospel: As at Wittemberge, Geneua, Zuriche, Conigsperge in Prussia, &amp;c.</p>
               <q>5 Name one Church, not builded in all fashions, as well for the making of the chancells, the forme of the aultars, the vse of the chalices, the signification of the vestiments, as also for the speciall intent of the builders thereof. Name one of them in the whole Church of Christ, either erected for your Faith, Church, &amp; seruice, or not prepared, in all sorts for catholike practises: Proue vnto me that any of all those thinges were euer prouided for any other seruice and Religion then ours, or that they be monuments of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Fayth and Church then the common Catholike, and I recant.</q>
               <p>HEre are many wordes to litle purpose. What if it were graunted that all churches that now remaine were builded by Papistes, and for popish vses, what had you wonne thereby. The same chalenge might the Idolaters haue made to the Apostles: Shew vs a temple in all the worlde that was not builded by Idolaters, and to mainteyne Idolatrie? Certeinly they could shew none when the Temple of Ierusalem was destroyed. But for all your bragges, we are able to shewe that such Churches as were builded by true Christians were not builded to such ende as yours are: for they were all builded in the honour of God, and the most of yours in the honour of creatures: for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you haue one Church in the honour of Christ, you haue neare a thousand in the honour of Sainctes: For <hi>Basilius ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnus</hi> in his 141. epistle proueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghost to be God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath a Temple. For <hi>Omne Templum Dei Templum est.</hi> Euery temple is the temple of God. Also <hi>Didymus,</hi> in his booke <hi>De spiritu sancto,</hi> which <hi>S. Ieronym</hi> translateth, vseth the same reason and to the same purpose. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in the same matter is very plentifull: as in his booke <hi>De vera Religione cap.</hi> 55. speaking of the Sainctes he sayth: <hi>Quare honoramus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2890:33"/>
charitate non seruitute, nec eis templa construimus, &amp;c.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we honour them with loue and not with seruice, neither doe we build temples vnto them: for they wil not be so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored of vs because they know that we our selues when we are good, are the temples of the highest. In this saying beside his iudgement for building of temples, note that he will not haue Sainctes to be honored with seruice, which he calleth <hi>seruitus,</hi> and is the same that <hi>dulia</hi> is, contrary to the Papistes which will worship them with seruice called <hi>dulia,</hi> or <hi>seruitus.</hi> Also in his 174. epistle to <hi>Pascentius,</hi> he sayth, the holy Ghost could not haue our bodies to be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples except he were God, And in his Enchiridion <hi>ad Laurentium, cap.</hi> 56. he sayth: <hi>howe should he not be God which hath a temple?</hi> Also in the 8. booke <hi>cap.</hi> 27. <hi>De ciuitate Dei. Nec tamen nos ijsdem martyribus templa, &amp;c.</hi> he sayeth: Christians builde no temples vnto Martyrs which were to make them gods. And in the 22, booke <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>De ciuitate Dei. Nos autem Martyribus nostris non templa sicut dijs, sed memorias sicut hominibus mortuis, quorum apud Deum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uunt spiritus fabricamus. Nec ibi erigimus altaria in quibus sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficemus martyribus, sed vni Deo &amp; martyrum &amp; nostro sacrifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um immolamus: ad quòd sacrificium sicut homines Dei, qui mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum in eius confessione vicerunt, suo loco &amp; ordine nominantur, non tamen à sacerdote qui sacrificat inuocantur, Deo quippe non i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psis sacrificat quamuis in memoria sacrificet eorum, quia Dei sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos est non illorum. Ipsum verò sacrificium corpus est Christi quod non offertur ipsis quia hoc sunt &amp; ipsi.</hi> that is: We truely do not build temples to our martyrs as vnto gods, but memories as vnto dead men whose soules liue with God. Neither doe we there set vp aultars in which we should sacrifice vnto the martyrs, but to God onely which is God both of the martyrs and of vs, doe we offer sacrifice: at which sacrifice they are named in their place and order, as men of God which haue ouercome the world in his confession: yet are they not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon by the Priest that doth sacrifice, for he offereth sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God and not to them although he doe sacrifice in their memorie, because he is the Priest of God and not of them, and the sacrifice is the body of Christ which is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto them because they them selues are the same. Here
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:2890:33"/>
also beside building of churches, note that no sacrifice ought to be offered to Martyrs, but prayer is a sacrifice, therefore it ought to be offered onely to God. Secondly, that Martyrs were not called vpon in tyme of the sacrifice but onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for remembrance. Thirdly, that Altares were not buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the honor of Martyrs or other Sainctes as they be in Popish churches: as our <hi>Ladies</hi> altar. <hi>S. Peters</hi> altar. <hi>S. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi> altar &amp;c. Fourthly, that the bodie of Christ, which he sayeth was the sacrifice that was offered, was not the naturall body of Christ but his mysticall bodie, because he sayeth the Martyrs and it are all one, whereby it is manifest, that he meaneth the sacrifice of thankes giuing offered to God for the redemption of his church by the death of Christ. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this one place were well wayed, it will interpret and aunswere all places of the auncient doctors, where mention is made of sacrificing the body of Christ at the time of the communion. But to returne to building of churches the same Augustine, <hi>contra Maximinum Arrianum. Lib. Titul.</hi> 11. hath these wordes: <hi>Nunc si templum alicui sancto angelo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentissimo de lignis &amp; lapidibus faceremus, anathematizar emin a veritate Christi, &amp; ab Ecclesia Dei, quoniam creaturae exhibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remus eam seruitutem quae vni tantum debetur Deo? Si ergo sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegi essemus faciendo templum cuicun<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> creaturae, quomodo non est Deus verus cui non templum facimus, sed nos ipsi templum su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus?</hi> that is: If we shoulde builde a temple of wodde and stones to any holy and most excellent Angel, shoulde we not be accursed from the Trueth of Christ and from the Church of God, because we should shew that seruice vnto a creature which is due onely vnto God? Therefore if we shoulde be sacrileges by making a temple to any creature, how is he not true God to whome we doe not make a temple, but we our selues are a temple. If this be true, how be not the Papistes accursed from the Trueth of Christ, and from the Church of God which builde and vpholde churches to Angells, as <hi>S. Michaels, S. Gabriels, &amp;c?</hi> So that to builde churches as Papistes doe, is church robbing or sacrilege. Furthermore whereas you will vs to name one church whose chancell is not builded in all fashions to serue poperie. First it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2890:34"/>
that the first Churches which were builded for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians had not the same fashion of chancels and other partes that most churches haue in Englande, for that purpose reade the Panegyricall oration made before <hi>Paulinus</hi> byshop of Tyrus. <hi>Euseb. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. In which is described the fashion of that church builded in that citie farre vnlike the moste parte of churches at this day in all partes, and specially in the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel which was in the middest of that church, a place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed in with grates or wodden latesses called <hi>Cancelli,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this worde chancel is deriued, and the aultar stoode in the middest of it wherof some similitude remaineth yet in olde Cathedrall churches. Contrariwise your chancells in most churches be at the East ende and the aulter hard at the wall, there was also but one alter in that church, but you in euery church must haue many, it is certaine also in their church the Ministers and Deacons stoode rounde about the table or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lter, but so they can not about your aultars except some of them stande on the toppe of the wall or in the windowe. Moreouer if you marke the most parte of olde churches in Englande you shall plainely see, that the chancells are but additions builded sence the churches, of likelihoode by the parsons that disdained to haue their place in the middest of the people as the olde manner was. Also you may see some churches builded rounde: as at London the Temple, and an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other is at Cambridge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And some churches haue the steple at the Est ende, very vnhandsomely for pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the roode lofte. Againe many churches haue crosse Isles in which the people can not see the chancell, nor the high aultar, which argueth that there was no vse of such chancells when they were builded: For such churches as are latelie erected haue the chancell and church all of one buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and are made of such fashion that men maye see the highe aultar in euery parte of them: Beside this, in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientall church, as their ceremonies are diuers from yours, so no doubt the fashion of their temples differeth from yours. As for chalices, the church in the beginning was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with wodden cuppes, and then came <hi>Zepherinus</hi> and brought in the vse of glasses. <hi>Acacius Amidenus</hi> is commended for selling
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:2890:34"/>
the golden and siluer vessels of the church, to redeme cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues. <hi>Socrat. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> also <hi>Offic. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. sayth the church hath golde, not to kepe it but to be bestowed for necessarie vses, for which it is lawfull to breake, melt, and sel, euen the holyest vessells of all. But of your church it is true that one said of olde time: ye had wodden chalices, and gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den priestes but now you haue golden chalices, and wodden priestes: your vestimentes are of as good stuffe as your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices. The olde church knew none such, but as your owne Authors write: when they wente to celebrate they changed the affection of their minde rather than the garmentes of their body: as <hi>Antoninus</hi> witnesseth of <hi>Fulgentius.</hi> Howbeit we are content that your church by her gorgeous garments as well as by other thinges shoulde declare it selfe to be that woman which is described to be clothed in purple, golde, perles, and such like ornamentes <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. Finally wheras you will vs to name one church that for the speciall intent of the builders, was not prepared in all sortes for Popish practises: Although I could name many, yet for examples sake, I name <hi>Pantheon,</hi> a church in Rome, prepared by the speciall and onely intent of the builders fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <q>Yea if I bring not the aduersaries them selues to acknowledge in the ende him to be wholy against their doctrine in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of articles of great importance, and therefore that he coulde not be of their church, I recant.</q>
               <p>YOu shall neuer bring vs, neither in the beginning, nor in the end to acknowledge that <hi>S. Paule</hi> is against vs in any article of our Faith, but we agree wholy with him. Neuerthelesse I know what you meane, &amp; will not be afraide to vtter. Forasmuch as immediatly after the Apostles time, corruption entred into the Church, which was hardly kept out, while they liued: as we maye learne by the Epistle to the Corinthians, you thinke that we dare not depende vpon any one mans iudgement: and therein you are not deceiued: for we must depende onely vppon Gods worde. But where you saye there is none but he dissenteth from vs in diuers articles of great importance, you saye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely: for you are not able to proue that <hi>Iustinus</hi> Martyr, or <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> two of the most ancient authenticall writers, that the Church next vnto the Apostles had, are against vs, in any point of doctrine wherein we differ from you? Yet are there certaine errors in them, which neither you, nor we allow, as is touched before in the answere to the 11. article 1. deman. But they are both wholly against you in diuers articles of your doctrine, and namely in transubstantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is one of the greatest articles of Poperie: as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> in the 34. <hi>cap.</hi>

Here, he plainely affirmeth that the substance of the Sacrament is turned into the nourishment of our bodies. Therfore it remaineth still after the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <head>The 17. Article conteyneth 5. demandes.</head>
               <q>1 I aske of them whether the Lutherans, Zuinglians, Illirians, Caluenistes, Confessionistes, Swenkefeldians, Anabaptistes and such like, be all of one Church?</q>
               <p>BEcause you would make simple men beleue, that there be so many diuerse sectes of Protestantes, as you haue giuen them names, I will first discusse these sectes, and afterwarde aunswere your question. Lutherans, you meane them that follow <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion of the Sacrament. Zuinglians, follow <hi>Caluines</hi> iudgement of the same. Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onistes, them that exhibited their confession at Auspurge, which were both the Lutherans and Zuinglians, so these 3, names may be contracted into two: Lutherans and Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. As for Illyrians, if you call them of <hi>Flaccius Illyricus,</hi> they be Lutherans, in opinion of the Sacrament, and differ onely in ceremonies, which can not diuide them from the faith. <hi>Caluine,</hi> and they that be of his iudgement, agree plainly with <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> so that of fiue names, there remaine but two sortes differing in opinion, whereunto you ioyne the Swenkefeldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Anabaptistes. Now to your question, these be not all of one Church, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Swenkefeldians &amp; Anabaptists be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable heretiks, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lutherans &amp; Zuinglia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (as it pleaseth you to cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) are of one true church, although they differ in one opinion, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, for although the one affirme a real presence, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other deny it, yet they both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent in this, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ, is receiued spiritually, not corporally, with the hart, and not with the mouth. Wherfore, this dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not so great (though there be error on the one side) but that they may be both of the Church of Christ, as well as <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> the Martyr, and all the Bishops of Africa, and a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:2890:37"/>
great many of Asia, differing with <hi>Stephanus,</hi> bishop of Rome, and the rest of his opinion in rebaptizing such as were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by heretiks.</p>
               <q>2 And if either they can proue vnto me, that these, being of such diuersitie in faith and religion make one Church.</q>
               <p>WE haue alwaies abhorred the heresies of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptistes, Libertines, Swenkefeldians, Daui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Seruitians, and all such. But that <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> may be both of one Church, differing onely in one opinion of the Sacrament, is declared before.</p>
               <q>3 Or that each of their sects may giue saluation to their folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, being so disagreable, one with an other in high points of our Religion.</q>
               <p>SAluation is the gift of God, and not in the power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny company, or sect of men: but this we affirme, that out of that Church, whereof we count <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,</hi> notwithstanding their diuerse opinions (which is but in one matter of the Sacrament) to be members, there is no saluation.</p>
               <q>4 Or that I should beleue all these rather then the Catholike Church, or one of these more then another, all making such a bold chalenge of the truth and Gospell.</q>
               <p>NO man requireth you to beleue all these, but the true Catholike Church onely. Neither doe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite you to beleue any one company of men, more then an other: but to beleue the trueth before fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood. Now, which of them hath the truth, that they all brag of, you must search in the word of truth, desiring the spirite of truth that you may vnderstand and beleue the truth, and so without doubt, you shall come to the knowledge of the truth, and of the Church of God, which is the piller and stay of truth.</p>

               <q>5 Let the Protestants of all these kindes put their heades toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and shew me a reason of these thinges, and with all, let them among them selues agree, to what sorte of these sectes they woulde haue me, and I will recant.</q>
               <p>SVch is your impudencie in this matter, as in all other, that you woulde make men beleue that the Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptistes, Swenkefeldians, Libertins, and other abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable heretikes, be Protestantes: But it is well that you can make none but fooles thinke so: as for the Protestantes, they neede take no great deliberation to aunswere your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandes but you had more neede to laye your heades toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reconcile the Thomistes, Albertistes, Ockamistes, Scotistes, Reales, and Nominalls, which be all sectes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, and especially your Canonistes, and diuines, about the articles of your religion, that is: whether the Pope be aboue the Councell, or the Councel aboue the Pope. Whether the Pope may erre and not the Councell, or whether the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell maye erre and not the Pope. These two: the Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and the Councells determination, being the rules of trueth in your religion and not agreed vpon: how can any trueth be certeine in your Church? As for <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> they agree vpon one rule of trueth, that is the worde of God, and differ onely for the applying or laying of this rule, &amp; yet but in one matter &amp; that not the greatest. But you Papists, some holding of the Pope, and some of the Councell, as rules of truth, can haue no ground nor certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof. Therefore if you woulde haue me, or any man, to be of your belefe. First determine how I shal know when I am in a right beleefe: one sayeth, if the councell alloweth it, an other sayeth if the Pope alloweth, what shall I doe, when one of these is against an other? yea when one Pope is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an other, and one councell against an other, shall I thinke that trueth changeth so often as they change. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer when one Pope graunteth, that the councell is aboue the Pope and that the Pope maye erre. Likewise one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell graunteth, that the Pope is aboue the councell and that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2890:38"/>
the councell may erre, as it hath bene within the 200. yeares, the councells of Constance and Basill, determined that the councell was aboue the Pope and that the Pope maye erre. Contrariwise, the councell of Ferraria, and Florence, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that the Pope was aboue the councell and that the councell might erre. <hi>Martinus</hi> 5. the Pope chosen by the councell of Constance, was of the same iudgement that the councell: But <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. that gathered the councell of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raria, and Florence against the councell of Basill, was of the contrarie iudgement. Nowe I woulde saye he were a wittie fellow, that coulde reconcile this geare together. For, if he be a Canonist that holdeth this opinion: that the Pope can not erre, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope him self graunteth that he may erre, which waye shall he turne him selfe? For, if this proposition be true: the Pope can not erre, then this is true also, that the Pope may erre: for if he can not erre he can not erre in saying so: And if the Pope erred in saying, he coulde erre where he can not erre, then this proposition is false, the Pope can not erre, so one proposition shalbe both true and false, which is impossible. Likewise if he holde that hilde that the councell can not erre, and the councell it selfe confesseth it that it may erre. Gentle maister N. reconcile me these together, which concerne a case that hath bene in practise and still is, in the Papistrie, and maye here trouble a mans conscience that woulde beleue your church, and if he haue any wit, restraine him for euer comming into your church: If you can not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie this knot nor winde your selfe out of this maze, vnlesse you will be still obstinate, it were wisedome for you to recant.</p>

               <p>HE is a foolish sophister, that reasoneth from names to things, as you doe most vainely and childishly: we mislike the names of Church, &amp; Catholike, because

we do sometimes vse these names: Congregation, and Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers or Protestantes, and therefore be no true members of the Catholike church: we neither mislike nor mistrust those names as you sclaunder vs, neither doe we boast and trust onely in these names, without the thinges them selues, as you doe, and as your forefathers the wicked Iewes, crying: the Temple of the Lorde, the Temple of the Lorde, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lorde: when they had nothing lesse than the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord, but rather a denne of theues: So, you crie, the Catholike church, the Catholike church, the Catholike church, when you haue nothing in deede but the synagoge of Sathan. But because you make so much of these two names, Church, and Catholike, let vs see what great mysteries are conteined in them.

The succession of Priestes from the very seate of <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, vnto whom our Lord after his resurrection, committed his sheepe to be fedde euen vnto this present bishopricke, doth hold me. Last of all that very name of Catholike doth hold me, which name, not without a cause, this Church alone hath so obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, among so many heresies, that wheras all heretiks would be called Catholikes, yet when a stranger shall aske: where men meete at the Catholike Church, none of the heretikes dare shew him, either their principall temple or house. All this, you will say maketh exceeding much for vs: yea, but heare that which followeth: <hi>Apud vos autem, vbi nihil horum est quod me inuitet ac teneat, sola personat veritatis pollicitatio: quae quidem si tam manifesta monstratur, vt in dubium venire non possit: proponenda est omnibus illis rebus, quibus in Catholica te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neor,</hi> that is: But among you where there is none of these thinges, that may prouoke or holde me, there soundeth the onely promise of truth, which if it be shewed so manifest that it can not come in doubt, is to be preferred before all those thinges, by which I am holden in a Catholike Church.

               <q>1 Moreouer, I aske of the Protestants: whether in that time, in which they holde the true church to haue bene hidden or lost: the people that learned this article of their Creede
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2890:41"/>
(I beleue the Catholike church) was bounde to goe from that church which they sawe, and taught them both the article, and all other thinges touching their faith and by which they were Christened, and receyued all other sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and commodities of saluation, whether they were bounde, I say, to beleue this vnknowen and close Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which they coulde neuer come vnto, nor by which they euer receiued; or coulde receiue any benefit, and so forsake that church by whom and in whom, they receiued both their faith and sacraments: Shew me therefore that the Christian men of these dayes, were charged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church, and baptized them, and I recant.</q>
               <p>THis demande, is like a drunken mans dreame, hauing neither heade nor foote: whether they shoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue the church was lost: whether they shoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue the church that was vnknowen to them, &amp;c. But if your demande haue any sense in it: This is my aunswere. The church was neuer lost, but hidden from the eyes of the worlde: Therefore, if the people that where taught that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle: To beleue the Catholike church, and were baptized to your church, vnderstood that this church, was not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church, which was so commonly called, but that God had a secret Congregation, which was in deed, the true Catholike church, they were bound to forsake your church, and to beleue the secret Congregation: for if a man had ben baptized of the Arrians and being brought vp by them, had learned that article, to beleue the Catholike church, which the Arrians would expound to be them selues, if afterward, by God his helpe, this man vnderstood, that the church of the Arrians, was not the catholike church, as he was taught it was, but that <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and a few other, that were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and persecuted, were the true Catholike church: he was bounde to leaue the Arrians, commonly called the church, and to ioyne him selfe with the secret, banished, hidde, and persecuted church of Christ. But as for your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish church, in that time of blindenesse and error taught not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:2890:42"/>
the people that article, nor any other but kept them backe from the knowledge, as well of that article, as of all other thinges that were necessary to their saluation: for you taught them nothing els, but to pronounce, and that full il fauoredly, like popingeys, certeine latine wordes, which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode no more than stockes or stones. So that the people had no instruction of you, no not of the name of God, in many places but that they receiued by vncertaine talke of their parentes, as it were from hande to hande: for how many thousand parishes are there in Englande, that within these 60. yeares woulde declare, that they neuer hearde ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in their life. As for that they hearde of their seruice, they learned as much of it, as of the ringing of their belles, which was a sounde without vnderstanding. Therefore you may be ashamed to speake of teaching the people, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefe and all thinges necessary for saluation, when you haue counted it heresie to learne their creede in English, or to reade the scripture in English, in which is conteined all thing necessary to be knowen for euerlasting saluation. Finally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you requier me to shew you that the Christian people of those dayes, were bounde to beleue any other church than that, which taught them the article of the church and baptised them, I trow I will so shew it you, that for both your eares, you dare not deny it: how saye you? The Christian people of the Greeke church, which were taught by the Greeke church, that article of the church, and by the same Greeke church were baptised, whether ought they to beleue any other church but the Greeke church? If you say no: then you acknowledge the Greeke church to be the true church which denieth the Popes authoritie, if you saye yea: Then you are welcome home, you recant.</p>

me, there might be some saued, with our Sacraments, and in the Communion or fellowship of the Papistes out of the Protestants Church, then there was a way to heauen, out of Gods Church: if they say that none could be saued by our Sacraments out of their close Church, then all men yong and old perished for those yeares without any hope of mercy, because they could not vnite them selues, and be incorporate to that company and Congregation, whereof they neuer neither hearde, nor coulde by any meanes sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.

               <q>1 Againe shew me any Church, or imagin if you can by good reason, a church of Christ in which there is no gathering together for preaching, no spirite of prophesying, no rodde of correction, no order of ministring nor any spirituall functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that can be named, proue me that there should be a true Church for a thousand yeares together, and lacked all these thinges.</q>
               <p>YOu would faine haue a great nombre of Articles and therefore you bring in one matter often times in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers phrase of words, that it might seeme a new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when it hath bene vttered twise or thrise before: as this Article is conteined before in the 5.8. and 9. Articles, where you shall finde it more largely aunswered. But let vs see, what this strange demande requireth, we must shew him a church, or els imagine by good reason a church of Christ without preaching, ministring, and discipline for a thousand yeares together. Although we will not graunt that it hath so longe continued without these exercises, yet because you geue vs leaue to imagine, we can imagine that it may as well continue without publike preaching, ministring, and discipline for a thousand yeares, as it did for three hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Constantine.</hi> But you will say there was preaching mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string, and correcting, though it were not knowen to the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes and persecutors, so say I vnto you, for that thousand yeres there was gathering together for preaching, ministring, and correcting, though the Pope and his persecuting Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates coulde not alwayes see it, nor come to the knowledge of it: for if they had once intelligence of it they smarted for it, as is knowen by the stories of the Waldenses, Bohemians, &amp;c. Furthermore continuall exercise of preaching, ministring of sacramentes, and executing of discipline, are notes of a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2890:44"/>
quiet and peaceable Congregation, not of a dispersed, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and disquieted Church. How often doth <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that the brethren could not be gathered togither for executing of discipline, whereby it is certeyne, that likewise they coulde not be gathered togither for other exercises. Therefore the intermission of these exercises in a persecuted Church, doth not proue the same to be no true Church: But where so euer there be two or three gathered togither in the name of Christ, there is he in the middest of them. But whereas you require the spirite of prophesie (except you meane the gift of interpreting the Scriptures) the Church in the most quiet and flourishing state, may want the spirite of shewing things to come, as well as the giftes of tongues, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>WE vtterly denye, that beside the true Church, there was an vntrue church, that practised those offices to the saluation of any man: for once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I tell you, you haue neither the preaching of the word, nor ministring of Sacraments, nor execution of discipline, according to the truth of God his institution, but either altogither changed, or else greatly corrupted.

               <p>AS the number of your articles doth draw to an ende, so your matter is farre spent, and therefore to make vppe your number, you must repete one thing twise. This demaund is conteined before in the 11. and 12. articles, where also it is fully aunswered. Notwithstanding, seeing it commeth againe it shal be briefly aunswered in this place. The Church is not called the piller of truth, because it should stand alwayes in the sight of the world: for then the defection, which <hi>S. Paule</hi> speaketh of, could not haue come, neither should the Church flie into the wildernes, as was declared to <hi>S. Iohn:</hi> But it is called the piller of truth, because that where so euer the Church is, either visible or inuisible, there is the truth. So though the Church were hidde a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne time in the wildernes, yet there was trueth with the Church. You seeme to be a good Arithmetrician: for no number soundeth in your mouth but a thousand. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse how long so euer it was, the piller of truth decayed not, And as God gaue his spirite, diuers times was bold to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge preaching and ministring of the Sacraments, yea, and so boldly, that it cost many of the chalengers their liues. As <hi>Berengarius, Bruno, Marsilus de Pandua, Ioannes de Gaudano, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annes VVickleffe, VValdo, Ioannes Hus, Ieronymus de Praga, &amp;c.</hi> Thus it is manifest that the Church hath diuers tymes chalenged her right, and withstood falshood.</p>

               <q>3 Let it be declared, how the gates of hell haue not preuailed, or Christes promise and warrant for her, not bene voyd &amp; frustrate, if a bastard Church exercising idolatry, as they say, hath spoyled the true Church of all holy actions, and the whole gouernment, and the whole name of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, almost euer since Christes tyme.</q>

And whereas you say, that your bastard church hath spoiled her of all holy actions, gouernment, and Christian name, it is a most impudent lye, as it is true, that you sawe a bastard church vsurped her holy name, counterfaicted her holy actions, and turned her gouernment into tyrannie.</p>
               <q>4 Let me see therefore howe the onely dearling and spouse of Christ shoulde be neglected of him so long.</q>
               <p>SHe hath not bene neglected of him, but felt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall aide, he hath geuen her safe deliuerance of her childe, &amp; taken it vp from the crueltie of the Dragon, he hath prouided her a place in the wildernesse, he

hath made warre with the Dragon for her sake, and driuen him out of heauen, he hath geuen her Eagles wings to flie into the wildernesse, he hath caused the earth, to swallow vp the water that shoulde haue caried her awaie, he hath geuen the remnant of her seede, Victorie ouer the Dragon.

               <p>THis hath bene often aunswered before, Christ hath neuer wanted his spouse in earth, though the blinde world can not alwayes see her, or when they see her,

will not acknowledge her to be his spouse, but persecute her, as if she were an adulteresse.</p>
               <q>7 Or that he shoulde be a heade either without a bodie.</q>
               <p>THese are but one thing in diuers phrases, as he hath neuer wanted his spouse in earth, so hath he neuer bene an heade without a bodie, and seeing these wordes in this sence are relatiues (for Christ is called a heade in respect of the Church which is his body, and the Church is called a bodie, in respect of Christ that is her heade) I aunswere you by a rule of the Logicians: No man knoweth a relatiue, except he know the correlatiue thereof, Therefore, though Christ had a bodie in earth, yet coulde it be knowen of none, but such as knewe Christ the heade of that bodie. Of whome, when the Papistes were ignorant, specially when they appointed an other heade in earth, it is no marueill, if they could not see the bodie of Christ, though he haue neuer bene without it.</p>
               <q>8 Or such an vnknowne and small bodie.</q>

               <p>THere is no man of what age or yeares soeuer he be that can be saued, except he be a member of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church. But how necessary it is to beleue the Catholike church, it is very doubtfull, as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande, and as the conclusion of this article seemeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. If you meane that it is necessary to beleue the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church, that is to say, that God hath an holy vniuersall Congregation, I graunt it is necessary to beleue. But I vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romish church is that holy Catholike church. But if you meane (as it seemeth) and as the rest of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes doe interprete that article, I beleue the Catholike church, that is: I beleue, what soeuer the church doth allow, to be true: I deny that it is necessary to saluation, that a Christian man should so beleue the Catholike church, both because the church may erre, &amp; also because something may be commonly receiued of the church, which is not materiall to saluation. And that this is a false interpretation of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Creede, I beleue the Catholike church, that is: I beleue what so euer she doth set forth or maintaine, to be true, appeareth manifestly by the wordes them selues: For who euer was so ignorant in the Latine tongue, to thinke that <hi>Credere Ecclesiam,</hi> and <hi>Credere Ecclesiae,</hi> were all one in signification. In deede if the wordes were: <hi>Credo Ecclesiae Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicae,</hi> in the datiue case, this interpretation might take place, but when it is in the accusatiue case, <hi>Credo Ecclesiam Catholicam,</hi> A boy that woulde conster it otherwise than thus: I beleue that there is a Catholike church, were worthy to haue a doosen stripes for his labour.

against God, in whome only we must beleue, neither do we say: <hi>Credo Ecclesiae,</hi> that is: I geue credit to the Church, as though she shoulde alwaies speake the trueth: But we saye and confesse against all heretikes and scismatikes: <hi>Credo Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiam &amp;c.</hi> that is: I beleue, that there is one Holy, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and Apostolike church, whereof I am a member &amp;c.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2890:48"/>
As open preaching in the face of the world, open ministring of Sacraments and execution of discipline, these are not to be required in a persecuted Church. Some were proper for a time, and then ceased, as working of miracles, and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther functions of the spirite. Some are neuer necessary in the Church, as succession of Bishops, vniformitie in ceremonies, &amp;c. But of all these notes, there is not one that is proper to the Church of Rome: for she hath not alwaies practised o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen preaching, and neuer preached the worde of truth, she hath conuerted but few nations to her Religion, from Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and them rather by warre, than by preaching: she neuer had sence she first arose, the ministring of sacraments accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Christ his institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, she hath hard matters in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, not for furtherance of Iustice, but for loue of money. Her iudiciarie power, may be dispensed withall for money. She hath had no orderly succession of Bishops, except an hore be an orderly Bishop of the Church of Rome: And except so many schismes as they write of, be orderly successions: she hath not vniformitie in all ceremonies, for diuerse nations, and diuerse Churches in these nations haue diuers ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as Sarum, Yorke, Bangor, &amp;c. in England: she hath not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in faith: for it is not yet determined, of one of the greatest articles of Popish faith, whether the Pope be aboue the church: she hath no holy functions of God his spirite, but prophane vsages of mens inuentions: she hath no true miracles, but the power of Antichrist in lying signes and wonders. She hath nothing lesse then the true sense of God his worde, which submitteth the same to her owne corrupt and changeable iudgement. She is not bewtified with estates commended in Scripture, as Apostles, Euangelists, Prophets, Pastors and Teachers, but with Popes, Cardinalls, Monkes, Chanons, Fryers, &amp;c. In steede of virgines, she hath filthy strumpets, her Nunnes, or else such foolish virgines as bring no oyle in their lampes: she hath no Martyrs, but obstinate traytors, as <hi>Becket, Fisher, More, &amp;c.</hi> she hath no confessors of trueth, though she haue ten thousand mainteyners of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood and lyes: Wherfore if these be the notes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Rome can in no wise be that same.</p>

               <p>THis gentle offer must needes be taken, I will proue vnto you, that the church of Rome, hath falsely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted diuers sentences of scripture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by that which she hath done, it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that she may do it. <hi>S.

God made man to his owne image <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. therefore we must haue images in the church.

As we haue heard, so we haue seene in the City of our God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. that is: God must not be knowen by onely hearing of his worde, but also by sight of images. If these be not true interpretations I reporte me to you. Beside these, I will bring you a sentence of holy Scripture, not onely falsely interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in sence, but also falsified in wordes, and concerning not a small matter, but euen one of the cheefe articles of our Faith. It is written in the 10. chapter of the Gospell after <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the 29. verse <gap reason="foreign">

This sentence they alleage, to proue that God the Father begetting his Sonne from euerlasting, gaue his owne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance vnto him, the wordes be in the 2. Canon. <hi>Pater enim ab aeterno filium generando, suam substantiam ei dedit, iuxta quod ipse testatur: Pater quod dedit mihi, maius est omnibus.

Goe your wayes now and perswade vs, that your church can not interprete any sentence of the scripture, falsely, when the Laterane Councell, which is your represented church hath thus both falsefied, and falsely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, this scripture.

not to the Sonne, or the holy Ghost, whether this be an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to define that it is vnlawfull to pray to God the Sonne, and God the holy Ghost, let euery man iudge. But you will except, that this was a prouinciall Synode, and not a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell. But I aunswere you, it hath the authoritie of a generall Councell, because it was confirmed in the sixt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell holden at Constantinople in Trullo. And as for the Popish church, that it maye erre, what neede we better proofe than the prayer, which it maketh, after the ending of euery generall Councell, <hi>Precamur scilicet vt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiae parcas &amp; errori indulgeas,</hi> that is we praye truely that thou wouldest spare our ignorance &amp; pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our error.

If it be impossible for the generall Councell to erre, what neede they pray to God to pardon their error, and when their owne conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth them and compelleth them to confesse, and that before God, that they may erre, what impudence is it in any man, to contend that they can not erre? Furthermore the second Councell of Nice, determined that Angels, and sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of men had bodies, were visible, and circumscriptible, and therefore might be painted, and this it affirmeth to be the iudgement of the Catholike church, <hi>Con.

If you say: these two last Councells did not erre, in condemning and deposing these Popes: Then the great generall, and OEcumenicall Councell of Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and Florence, did erre, in disallowing the determination of these Councells. Thus it is manifest that the Romish church, which they them selues confesse, to be represented in a generall Councell, may erre, which hath so often erred. And if it may erre, and be deceiued it selfe, what man is he, that neede to doubt: Whether it maye induce any error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people.</p>

Therefore if it be an vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hurtefull vsage, to preferre mans traditions before God his commaundementes, the Church in <hi>S.

For as soone as the Church of Christ beganne to grow vp after his ascension, euen in the Apostles time, there were many sectes and heresies, As the Iewes that mainteyned the lawe, they that denyed the Resurrection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Corinthians <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus, Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, Cerinthus, Ebion, Marcion, Basilides, Valentinus, Carpocrates, &amp;c.</hi> So that there were many more heresies, at the first prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospell, in, and immediatly after, the Apostles time, then at the last restoring of the publike preaching ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto the worlde in our dayes: And yet the Apostolike Church was one Church, and so is ours at this day one and the same.</p>

And I conclude as he doth, the Pope was neuer President either of honor, or of authority, but by the graunt or permission of the Councell. And how is the Popish church able to gather general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells at this daye? who will come at her calling? Except a few Spaniardes, and a ioly company of buckram bishops of Italie? generall Councells of all the worlde, can neuer be gathered, but either whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is a Monarchie, or els (which is not to be looked for) that all the Princes of the worlde, will consent together.</p>

               <p>THe description of the Spouse of the Lambe, set forth in <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Reuelation, doth in all pointes most aptly agree vnto our holy Church and congregation.

She trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnder her feete, the Moone of mutabilitie, changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse, and inconstancie, she is crowned with 12. starres, which is the doctrine of the 12. Apostles, the worde of God. She is alwaies fruitefull, and persecuted by the deuill and his members, but yet by Christ defended, protected, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for in all daungers and aduersities. But the church of Rome, is that whore of Babylon clothed in purple and scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, golde, precious stones, and perles, described <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17. sitting vpon the beast with seuen heades, which are the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hilles, and is the great cytie that had dominion ouer the kinges of the earth.</p>

               <q>Proue vnto me therefore that these excellent and propre callinges, can agree to any disordered companie or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or to any vnknowen society of men: but onely to the true Church of Christ spred throughout the whole worlde by Christes his promise, and by vertue of his spirit, continued in truth and grace from falshood sence Christes time, and I recant.</q>
               <p>AS many of these excellent names, as in the worde of God, or the doctors agreeing with the worde of God, are propre or perteyning to the true Church of Christ, so many haue I proued to be propre and perteyning to our most holy and well ordered Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And moreouer that they can in no wise be rightly applied to that most abhominable, Idolatrous, and disordered Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoge of Rome, which is vtterly departed from the faith, geuing heede to spirites of error, and doctrines of deuills, being so liuely painted forth and euen pointed forth by the scripture to be that Antichristian church, whereof the holy Ghost prophesieth, that no man, except he will wilfully be blinde, can be ignorant thereof, so that if you be not starke blinde, and geuen vp into a reprobate sence, when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these thinges you will recant.</p>
               <q>Let any man therefore aliue answer directly and plainly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out colour or fraude of wordes and vnprofitable digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the foresayd or any of the foresayd demandes, and I shall willingly leaue the knowne Church &amp; playne way of Saluation, and wander in the woodes to seeke after them, and their congregation.</q>
               <p>IF you had not added this conclusion, we might haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued some hope, that vpon further instruction in such matters as troubled your conscience you would haue ben

contented to be reformed after God his worde, and good counsell. But now you declare that you are so obstinatly bent that what so euer be proued against you, you will not receiue it as truth but yeld vnto it perforce.

And to confesse the truth in deede, I was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what loth (such was my foolish feare then) to fall in hand with that matter, which being well and to the bottom ripped, I percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, of all other causes in the world, most to touch the very sore of heresie, and therefore might to me procure the hatred of such, whose loue otherwise I could be content, either to keepe or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:2890:63"/>
winne. Besides that, I saw the contention of the contrary part, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to make some answere to such thinges as might in this cause most greeue their mindes, or marre their matter, shoulde driue me from that course of study, which otherwise in quietnesse I would most gladly keepe, to serue truth and defende my cause, which once of freedom and good will taken in hand, must after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of duety and necessitie be vpholden. Notwithstanding all these thinges, good reader, which might most iustly hold me back, yet now my friendes request, the case and condition of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time, and my duety towards my mother the Church, may of good reason, and must of necessitie chaunge my former intent, &amp; remoue my priuate study to the benefite of the common cause. Therfore being at length by iust occasion wholy minded to serue as well as I could that way, I thought good these late months, to make a more full declaration of that thing, which at my sayde friendes request, I had so briefly touched before. That as then when he first had it of me, it onely serued him for his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, the pleasuring of his singular and secret friendes, and the helpe of some simple whome he knew deceyued by ouer light looking on so graue matters, so nowe (good Christian reader) I trust it may helpe in common, not onely such as haue been caried a way by the guile of heresie, but other that are much subiect to the daungerous flattery of this present time: with whome, pleasure euer ioyned to the protestantes doctrine, often more preuaileth, then the preachers persuasion. Be bolde to charge any of our aduersaries, make he neuer so great accompt of him selfe, with the force of trueth heere expresly proued both by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and authoritie: if it holde him not, he shall (I am sure) brast out with impudencie, and not lose him selfe by reason, iust dealing, or honestie. And if it be proued to touch with safetie the poison it selfe, let no man doubt to vse it for a preseruatiue, in this common infection of our time and countrie. For it were no reason, any man shoulde practise with the poore people priuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in such thinges as he were not hable to mainteine before their pilloures and preachers openly. And for that hatered which I may procure to my selfe by mine owne trauell, it shall not much moue me: for I shall either be partaker thereof, as a common praise in these euill dayes to most good men: or els if I be not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2890:64"/>
worthy so much, I will learne to beare it as some parte of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; satisfaction for my sinnes. I may not bye frendship with flatterie, nor mannes loue with forsaking Gods trueth. Of such thinges then I will not make much reckening: but my principall care is, that in writing or wading in so deepe matters, I keepe the streight line of the Churches truth, which, in the exceding rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of these darke dayes, a man may quickely lose. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make sure, I humbly submit my selfe, to the iudgement of such our maisters in faith and religion, as by Gods calling are made the lawefull Pastors of our soules. Of whome I had rather learne my selfe, then teach other: if either they had occasion and opportunitie to speake, or I might of reason and duetie in these miserable times holde my peace. Farewell gentle Reader, and if I pleasure thee by my paines, let me for Christes sake be partaker of thy prayers.</p>

But where you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende your freinde, for that he learned to beleeue first, and sought to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand afterwarde, which you take to be the natural order of a Christian schoole, if you had shewed where you learned that methode, his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation should haue been the greater, and your iudgement the weightier. For we learne by Saint Paule, a contrary order, namely first to heare the worde of God preached and expounded, and then to beleeue it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. For God by the riches of his grace, hath abounded towardes vs, in all wisedome and vnderstanding, and hath opened vnto vs, the mysterie of his will, according to his good pleasure, so that after we hearde the worde of trueth, the Gospell of our saluation, we haue thereby beleeued, and so are sealed with the holy Spirite of promise, laboring and praying, that those which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2890:64"/>
haue receaued the first grace of knowledge, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, may daily more and more, increase in the same, that they may be full filled with knowledge of Gods will, in all wisedom &amp; spirituall vnderstanding. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. And as for that blinde faith, which must be thrust vppon mens consciences, to be accepted before they see what grounde it hath, we leaue it, as meete for sect masters and heretikes, and in no wise to be admitted by the Disciples of Christ, who calleth all men to heare him, and vnderstand him. <hi>Matt.</hi> 15. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. But faith (say you) in most matters must direct reason. But I say, reason in all matters must be subiect to faith. For the naturall man with all his reason, neither doth, nor can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the things of the spirite of God, for the eye hath not seene, nor the eare hath hearde, neither haue entred into the heart of man, the thinges that God hath prepared for them that loue him, but God hath reueiled them to vs by his spirite. 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. And this is the thing that deceiueth you <hi>(Maister Allen</hi>) which more like a maister of prophane artes, then a good student of holy Diuinitie, can put no difference betwene carnall reason, and spirituall vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For that knowledge and vnderstanding of Gods holy mysteries, conteined in his word, whereuppon our faith is grounded, we haue, not by light of naturall reason, but by reuelation and opening of Gods spirite. But omitting this matter, as touched by the way, with two other pages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, as containing nothing materiall to be aunswered, I will come to the third leafe and second face, where you promise an orderly proceeding in the matter you take in hand. Which order of yours, if you had not professed your selfe to obserue, men might haue taken your hochpot, to be such as your matter would bring forth, &amp; that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Purgatory should be like the troublesome state ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: but when you are not content, to haue your methode counted to be of the nature of your matter, but you will needes make boast of an orderly proceeding, in so disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a cause, you must not be offended if your confusion in steade of order, be sometime discouered.</p>
               <p>Howbeit the want of order were a small fault, if the

But what assurance shall other men haue of your doctrine? when you your selfe affirme, and haue learned (as you say out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>) that such doctrine and mysteries, may not be safely had at such a mans hand as you are, but onely of holy Priestes and Byshops, which with the succession of their office, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a sure and certaine gift of truth according to the pleasure of their father. It is the duety, not onely of a good teacher, but euen of a good Christian, to say with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist: I haue beleued, and therefore I haue spoken.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2890:66"/>
in these our dayes, in menne professing Christian religion: with what conscience can maister Allen affirme? that there was neuer lesse store of learning then in this age, when euen in remembraunce of men that are aliue, there was a great deale lesse store then is nowe, but in their fathers and grandfathers time, there was almost nothing but rudenesse and barbarousnesse, euen with the same conscience, that soone after he affirmeth that pleasure is euer ioyned to the Protestants doctrine, which more preuaileth then the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers perswasion. If you had meant <hi>Master Allen</hi> that peace of God which passeth all vnderstanding, which they tast of, that by the Protestants doctrine haue learned that they are iustified by faith. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. and to that perpetual ioy in the holy Ghost, whereunto we are exhorted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. wherein the kingdom of God consisteth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. we willingly would haue consented, that such pleasure is alwayes ioyned to the Protestants doctrine: but seeing it is more like, you speake of carnall pleasures, I must say thus much to confound your blasphemous tongue, and to dashe out your slaunderous writing: let the worlde witnesse that heareth our doctrine, and God iudge that seeth our hearts, whether carnall pleasures be ioyned to our teaching, which daily preach with all vehemency and earnestnes, vnfained repentaunce, mortification, deniall of our selues, bearing of the crosse, hatred of this world, amendment of life, holines and righteousnes, and that vnder paine of euerlasting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And whether pleasure more then the godly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the preachers, preuaileth to winne professors of our doctrine, if it be not so clearly seene in this Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by the meanes of the great peace and tranquilitie, we haue through Gods singular goodnes, vnder the happy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of our Soueraigne Lady enioyed these many yeares: looke to those Churches of God in Fraunce, and the lowe countryes of Germany, which within these twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares haue bene for the most part planted, growne vp, &amp; flourished altogither vnder the heauy crosse and most sharp persecution, what carnall pleasure hath allured them? what worldly voluptuousnes hath and doth still intise them, in so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2890:66"/>
great multitudes to embrace this doctrine? whereof if they tast neuer so smal, they see present daunger of death or losse of all their goods with banishment. Surely, this is the Lords doing, and it is marueilous in our eyes. But to conclude: this man, if he can not haue loue and praise for his valiant enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, yet by patient bearing of hatred and reproch, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth full account of satisfaction for his sinnes. O miserable conscience of the Papistes, which haue no peace with god through faith in his infinite mercy, but seeke to satisfie the streightnes of his eternall iustice, by such beggerly shiftes as these, which also he is so vncertaine whether they wil serue his turne, that he feareth lest he lose al his labour, if he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to lose the streight line of the Churches truth, which in these darke daies, a man may quickly lose. What say you <hi>M. Allen</hi>? is it so hard a matter to keepe the streight line of the Churches truth in these darke dayes? Why? Where is the citie builded vpon an hill that can not be hidden? Where is that visible and knowne Church which can not erre? If that which was wont to be the only rule of truth among Papists faile you, try an other rule of the Protestants, and as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> exhorteth you, search the word of God in the holy Scriptures, and then vndoubtedly you shall finde the truth and the Church also, that is the piller of truth, though the dayes be neuer so darke, or your eyes neuer so dymme: if with like humilitie you would submit your self to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therof, as you pretend to doe to the ministers and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of your faith and religion. The Lorde if it be his will, open your eyes, that you may see the truth, and geue you grace when you see it, that you striue not against it, to your owne destruction.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you had not promised and professed an orderly proceding in this cause, we woulde neuer haue enquired, whether good order would require, that an heretike should haue bene first defined, before he were diuided. And especially in this controuersie, where either partie chargeth other with heresie, it had been conuenient, that the right defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or description of an heretike had bene first set downe, that men might thereby haue learned who is iustly to be burdened with that crime. For an heretike is he, that in the Church, obstinatly mainteineth an opinion, that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the doctrine of God, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in the holy Scriptures, which if any of vs can be proued to doe, then let vs not be spared, but condemned for heretiks. But if iust proofe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of can not be brought against vs, but contrarywise we be able to shew manifest euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that our aduersaries doctrine is cleane contrary to the Scriptures of God, then let the name of heretikes be applied to them, to whome the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition doth agree, with further punishment due to calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niators, that slaunder other men in that whereof they are guilty them selues. Nowe to the matter of this Preface,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2890:68"/>
which as the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t declareth, consisteth of three partes, wherof the first is, that there be two sorts of heretiks, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vertue, the other ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly professing vice. This part is shewed in three leaues following. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of which point I will no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> differ with you, yet something will I note in your handling thereof, as occasion moueth me. First you affirme that heresie and all willfull blindnesse is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a iust plague of God for sinne, I mislike not your affirmation, but I maruaile how you can affirme this, and be a good Catholike: when we cannot say halfe so much, but we are charged by you, to make God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> author of sinne. But such is the force of trueth, that oftentimes the enimies thereof them selues, when they speake without contention cannot auoyed a true confession. God therefore, as this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist can not now deny, punisheth sinne with sinne, not as an euil author, but as a rightuous iudge. Proceding further you say that Christ hath geuen all heretikes this marke, that there vnsemely works should euer detect their fained faith: wherein, you speake not onely contrary to the trueth, but euen to your owne affirmation before. For our Sauiour Christ hath apoynted false prophetes to be knowne by their fruites, which is there false doctrine contrary to Gods worde, cloked with the sheepe skinnes of fained holinesse and vertue, which though it be many times discouered, yet is it many times so closely conueyed, that it clearly esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the iudgement of all men. Who was euer hable to chardge that damnable heretike Pelagius with any noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious crime or wicked behauiour in his outwarde life and conuersation? you your selfe confesse, that there appeared in him nothing, but grauity, constancy, and humility. If his doctrine had not bene found contrary to the word of God, he shoulde neuer haue bene tried to be a faulse prophete by his workes. Such are many of his scholers the free will men of our time, whose opinion, if it were not manifestly repugnant to the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, there manners are vnreprouable in the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of mortall men. The like may be said of Iouinian (who if he were so great an heretike, as you make him) yet he himselfe as you shew
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2890:69"/>
after out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> offended not in that, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded others to doe. Your last example of heretiks open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professing vice, is of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by whose licentious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, you affirme that your faith &amp; Christes Church, were brought to a small roome &amp; very great streights. If this be true tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> you affirme, that the Catholike Church must be otherwise estemed, and by other notes then you are wont to describe it: or else, your Church by your owne assertion can not be counted Catholike. For if Christes Church be brought to a small roome and great streights, where is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersality, Consent of all nations, multitude of people, &amp;c. that you are wont to talke of? But by your discipline the schoole of lust hath bene reasonably, till our dayes, kept vnder, &amp; the grauitie of Christian maners as the time ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, orderly vpholden. You doe well to qualifie your asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueration with those termes, reasonably, orderly, and as the time serued. For otherwise the whole Christian worlde should be witnesse against you, and yet to shew, with what reason, order, or opportunitie, the schoole of lust hath bene shut vp before our time, or yet is. Wher your doctrine most preuaileth, let the filthy stewes and brothel houses, opened in euery citie, yea and at your mother citie of Rome, most licentiously of all other, not onely by your gouernours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but also by your doctors defended, let them I say, beare sufficient witnesse against you.</p>

                     </note> fully to declare how sinne in all pointes hath achiued such libertie, by the vnhappy yoking her selfe vnto heresie. Onely this may be noted briefly for that point: that generally in the beginning of their endeuours, they remoued with speede out of their wayes, as especiall impediments and stumbling stockes, all those meanes which Christ commaunded, or the Church prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, or our fathers followed for thabating of sinnes dominion:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2890:71"/>
that the world might well vnderstand, they meant the extolling of all vice, and to make the way for sinne and wickednesse. First that soueraigne remedy of mans misdeedes, that graue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment left by Christ to his Church, for the weale of vs all, that power which the Sonne of man hath in earth to remit sinnes, the true court of mans conscience, the very word of reconcilement, and the borde of refuge after shipwracke, which is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of penaunce, they haue to the vnspeakeable gaine of sinne vnworthely remoued. The subduing of mans pride by due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his spirituall pastors, and humble honouring of the guides of Gods Church, fitly for their purpose haue they lowsed. Fasting, which is the bridle of carnall concupiscence, &amp; torment of all fleshly lustes, for sinnes sake they haue set at such liberty, that it is almost lost. And what hauoke in all other spirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise is made for these mens free passage to hell, we se it: all the posteritie shall feele it: and the very workers shall be weary of the way of wickednesse, when they shall lacke grace and space to repent them. But I can not now stand vpon these pointes: Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at this time, onely to ouerthrow an other like ground of this detestable schoole, which hath no lesse auaunced sinne then the other, and dishonoured God much more: which hath perniciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly deceiued not onely open heretikes, but also much weakened the deuotion of some that otherwise were Catholikes: The harme whereof pertaineth not onely to most men that be aliue, but also to many that be deade. That is the abolishing of penaunce, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crediting of purgatory, and abandoning of satisfaction for our offences committed. All which, being nothing else but a kinde of soft handeling, and sweete cherishing of sinne, hath wrought such vaine securitie in mens mindes, that few haue any feele or feare of Gods iudgements: fewe consider the deepe wound that sinne maketh in mans soule: and most men abhorre the remedies requisite for so grieuous a sore.</p>

               <p n="2">2 You haue vndertaken to proue that our time is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with heretikes openly professing vice, by whom if you would meane the <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> and <hi>Libertines</hi> of our time, we would not striue with you: but seeing you are not ashamed to accuse thereof the true worshippers of God &amp; professors of his Gospel, I must plainly tel you, that you are a blasphemer of God &amp; a sclaunderer of his Saincts. But let vs consider your profes, and so we shall best bewray your blaspheming. First you wil men to looke back to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> christian Epicures, whom before you named, from which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber you
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2890:72"/>
except the wicked <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as though he also were a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Epicure, &amp; we (say you) our doctrine, attempts &amp; the whole race of our proceedings compared with them, shall not only match them in all points, but passe them in most. If your meaning were as your wordes sound, I would easily agree with you, when you name your selfe and your fellow Papists. But because I know, whatsoeuer you speake here of your selues, you vnderstand of vs that are your aduersaries, I must proue that which you sayd to be true, &amp; that which you meaned to be false. For to leaue your generall tayling, not meete to be aunswered: I will come to your particuler crimes which are sacriledge, incest, apostasie feasting and chambering. Then who are gilty of sacriledge? but they that robbe God of his honour, and geue it to stockes and stones? who are rather to be charged with incest then they which beside their abominable filthy life, allowed dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for such persons to marry, as the lawe of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhorreth? and where is apostacie to be found, if it be not in them which are cleane departed from the faith of Christ, attending to spirites of errour and doctrines of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills, forbidding to marry and commaunding to abstaine from meates which God hath created to be receaued with thankes geuing. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. and as for feasting, where is it more gluttonous, then among the greatest professors of fasting? Euen their Carthusian fastes, and their good fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day fastes, among the wealthy of that sect, compared with the sobre diet of Christians, is voluptuous banqueting. And concerning chambering, if the world were not to to full of examples of their filthy lechery, which professe wiuelesse chastitie: yea if their brutish lust were not broken out of the secrete chambers into the open stewes, I would spend more time to proue it. Then let all men indifferently iudge who hath not matched, but also ouerpassed the Epicurean heretikes of the former ages. There is yet an other crime contained in his former exception, and that is, that we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe <hi>Mahomet,</hi> in allowing often diuorses and mariages in mens wiues life. We allowe no diuorses, but such as Christ alloweth for adulterie, and we wish that adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2890:72"/>
were punished as God commaunded in his lawe, and then the other question of mariages were soone aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But howsoeuer the adulteresse liueth after diuorsment, she is no more the wife of him from whom she was diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. But farre many more causes of diuorsement doth the Popes canon law deuise, and if mariage after diuorsement be vnlawfull, why is it dispensed with all by the Pope? But to returne to our former accusations, which are so egerly followed, that before any one peece of proofe is brought against vs, they are sayd to be so manifest, that we haue not so much as any reasonable excuse to hide them, but onely to terme vice by the name of vertue. And then we must be examined by what right we chaunge the names of thinges that can not alter their natures. Stay a while your examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>M. Allen,</hi> this is no orderly proceding. Good order would require, that you shoulde first proue vs gilty of the crimes, and then to take away our excuses. Howebeit, I blame you not if you leaue of the proofe of those thinges, which would sooner reproue your selues, then conuict your aduersaries. And yet that you may see howe cleare a conscience we haue in these crimes obiected, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to answere your interrogatories, although by no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and orderly proceding I can be compelled thereto.

Who taught you to call that religion, which holy Scripture calleth Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, or that true deuotion, which God calleth vaine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping, where learned you to call a gluttonous feast of fish, a religious fasting? or a sumptuous banket of wine, spices, fruites and deintie conseites, a streight and holy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence? with what face or conscience can you call that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowing lust of your popish vnmaried Cleargie, a pure and vndefiled chastitie? Finally, where learned you but of the Deuill him selfe to commaund abstinence from meates and mariage, for religions sake? to some men at all times, and to all men at some times? If for these and an hundred such, you can shew no better warrant, then the termes of your fathers, the practise of your elders, or the authoritie of mortall men, the curse of God pronounced by <hi>Esay,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that call euill good, or good euill, must needes be turned ouer vnto you. But to goe on with this orderly proceding, whereby we are first accused and then by and by condemned, without euer being conuicted, or once put to the triall. Next of all, lest men should maruell howe so manifest impietie could so mightely preuaile, they are told that it is onely present pleasure, and similitude of maners that ioyneth so many vnto vs. And for proofe hereof, men must call to remembraunce the first entrance of this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2890:73"/>
how these preachers haue had certaine persons in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration for their owne aduantage. We refuse not the triall, but let men on Gods name call to remembraunce howe our doctrine beganne to be restored in these last dayes. I pray you what priuate aduantage could they by any likelyhood be supposed to seeke, which incurred ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest daunger of their liues by the least suspition of their profession? or what persons could they haue in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when all Princes &amp; great personages were their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test persecutors? but they wanne them by flattery, and sewed them cushians vnder their elbowes, and laid pillowes vnder their heades. This is in deede a sore accusation, but where is the proofe? Forsoth to such as made no store of good workes, they cast onely faith vnder their elbowe to leane vppon. O impudent blasphemer, which of vs euer taught that such a faith as is not liuely, &amp; fruitefull of good workes, did euer profite any man but to the increase of his damnation? <hi>To such as were burdened with promise of chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they made a cushen for their ease.</hi> To such as had rashly vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed that which they could not possibly performe, not we but <hi>S.

If euer any man hearde this text alleged by any preacher for such pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, let that man be counted such one as <hi>M. Allen</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth him, if no man were heard euer to speake after that maner, let <hi>M. Allen</hi> be taken for a man of such truth, as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2890:74"/>
he sheweth him selfe to be. But it is a small thing to breake the bondes of modestie in a fewe poyntes, if a man striue not to passe impudencie it selfe in shamelesse lying. <hi>Commit what you list, omit what you list, your preachers shall prayse it in their wordes, and practise it in their workes.</hi> Sauing that vaine glorious affecters of painted eloquence, be sometime so carefull of their wordes, that they forget their matter. I would haue thought that the father of lies him selfe the continuall accuser of Gods Sainctes, would haue feared for euer losse of his credite, to haue vttered so vnseemely a sclaunder of vs. But I suppose that this disciple of his more regarding how finely, then howe truely he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyeth against his aduersaries, had such pleasure in allusion of these termes commit and omit, praise and practise, words and workes, that he respected not what sense they made, so they were handsomly matched togither. Well, howsoeuer our workes shalbe found when they shall be openly iudged before him that best doth know them, I am sure they shall not proue worse then the popish cleargy, and if they shall be examined by mans iudgement, me thinke they should be very vnequall Iudges, before whom we should not be able to approue our innocency, in comparison of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doings. But that in wordes we praise all maner of sinne, whether it be in committing that which God forbiddeth, or in omitting that which God commaundeth, If that I say can be proued against vs, then let our enemy pursue our soule and take it, yea let him tread our life downe to the earth and lay our honour in the dust. But to returne to our works, what example is brought out to confirme the same? Not the particular faultes of some of our profession, that might beare some colour of confirmation lest for the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of euery one of our side he might be requited with the enormities of an hundreth of his owne sect, but that he chuseth which is common to most of our preachers, &amp; not to be found in any one of theirs. This no doubt must be some great offence to iustifie so heinous an accusation. In deede a great mote in the Papistes eyes, that is the mariage of our ministers. Blessed be God, that although some singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2890:74"/>
persons may be accused of notorious crimes, yet our whole state can not be charged by this instrument of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than with no greater fault, then the allowance of Gods owne institution. And yet see howe this rowling rhetorici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an scoffeth with the schole mens terme of <hi>Annexum ordini.</hi> Be like <hi>S. Paule</hi> taketh mariage to be so annexed to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an ecclesiasticall minister, that he neuer describeth the perfect paterne of a Bishop or Deacon, but one of the first pointes is, that he be the husband of one wife. But I pray you <hi>M. Allen</hi> though you can not away with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of vowed Priestes: are you also angry with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of our new disordered ministers (as it pleaseth you to call them) which neuer tooke your order, nor medled with any vowes? you were wont to account them for mere lay men, and will you not allow the mariage of lay men at least wise to be lawfull, if you can not with the Apostle call it honorable? Is that which the Apostle counteth hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, of you called licentious life? and which the spirite of God nameth an vndefiled bed, dare you terme it contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibly a couch for delicate persons ease? What haue you here to cloke your open blasphemy, for your wordes are not of the abuse, but of the state of mariage it selfe. You procede with like modesty to affirme that we haue remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all those meanes that might serue for the abating of sinnes dominion, and which are they? For soth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of penaunce, fasting, and the opinion of purgatory. To the first we answere that we know no Sacrament of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce instituted by Christ, but the doctrine of repentance defaced by the false and deuilish perswasions of auriculer confession, superstitious satisfaction, and popish absolution we haue faithfully restored, according as the same is taught in the holy Scriptures of God. And those other we haue remoued as being not onely contrary to the doctrine of Gods word, but also as most pernicious pillowes and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemous boulsters of all sinne and securitie. For what feare or conscience could be of sinne intended or committed, where this perswasion tooke place, that, the fast once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed in the eare of a priest, and a fewe wordes by him
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2890:75"/>
pronounced after a sory satisfaction of a pelting penance according to the Priestes pleasure, was a full and sufficient discharge both before God and the world. And as for the power and authoritie of pardoning or reteining sinnes, that our Sauiour Christ hath committed to his ministers, is not taken away by vs, but truly declared to be the iudgement of God and not the absolute authority of man. But how bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemously the Papists chalenge vnto them selues this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, let it appeare by this that <hi>M. Allen</hi> calleth it, that power which the sonne of man hath in earth to forgiue sinnes, by which words our Sauiour Christ challengeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him self, that which is proper vnto his diuinitie, although he were humbled in the shape of a seruaunt vppon earth, namely an absolute authority to forgiue sinnes, which none hath in heauen or in earth but only God. And as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of fasting, if that be fasting which they call fasting, namely the eating of fish, it hath not bene diminished but increased in our time, and as for true fasting and abstinence in deede, it hath bene publikely commaunded &amp; obserued as occasion was offered, and priuate fasting with the right vse thereof is still commended in our doctrine, &amp; men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted vnto it. Onely the abuses, superstition and deuilish doctrine set forth by the papistes is remoued, if it be litle practised, it is because among many professors there are but few followers of the Gospel. But looke vpon the persecuted congregations and you shall see often publike fasting, the priuate exercise the Lord knoweth, and hath commaunded to be couered rather then opened. Nowe must we come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion of purgatory, which in deede togither with masse of <hi>Scala coeli,</hi> we haue vtterly remoued and digged vp euen from the very foundations, howsoeuer <hi>M. Allen</hi> gathering togither the old rude rubbish, &amp; tempering it with new &amp; fine cement, would labour to build it vp againe. And euen as I sayd of popish confession and satisfaction, so say I of purgatory, we abhorre the opinion therof, not only as bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemous against the bloud of Christ which purgeth vs from al our sinnes, but also as a very canch of careles secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which Sathan hath deuised to aduaunce the dominion
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2890:75"/>
of sinne. For where as the feare of euerlasting torments of hell fire is the right terrour to bridle iniquitie, as that which is due for sinnes and wickednes, &amp; yet restraineth not the vngodly from their abominable life, what restraint shall there be when the eternall paines are chaunged into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, &amp; the temporall paines may be redemed by so small a price as popish satisfactions may be bought for? which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption if it be neglected in mens life, yet it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by their friendes after their death. <hi>M. Allen</hi> sayth fewe of vs consider the deepe wound that sinne maketh in mans soule. But we may iustly say to the Papistes that they neither consider the depth of the wound, nor the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the medicine. For we consider the wound of sinne to be as deepe, as the deepest pitt in hell, which will not be filled vp with the slabbersawce of mens merits and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but onely with the bloud of the onely sonne of god, which is so soueraigne a salue for this so desperate a sore, that of them that were the children of wrath and deade in sinnes, it quickneth them, rayseth them to life, and placeth them in heauen with Christ. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. And as for that pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full penaunce, that <hi>M. Allen</hi> complaineth to be so negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in our tyme, he chargeth vs vniustly with the cause thereof. For within tyme of mans memory, before the light of the Gospell did shine openly, we saw no such pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full penaunce commonly, but v. ladyes psalters, v. pater nosters, v. pence to v. poore men in remembraunce of the v. woundes, v. fry dayes fast and such like. And as for pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, it was but a pastime for such as loued to roue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the cuntryes. The hardest penaunce was to pay so deare for the paultry of Monkes merites, and Fryers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Popes pardons, and such like. <hi>Et hinc illae lachrymae.</hi> This maketh the bitter complaint, that this marchaundise will no more be bought, but this is the iudgement of God vpon the great whore of Babylon.</p>

The chiefe considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as I gather) is for that men endeuour not to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendes and recompence, by satisfying for their sinnes, and therefore for answering some part of Gods iustice, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect purging of the same sinnefull life past, there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth sharpe punishment after this lyfe. I will commit to Christ, to be reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, the horrible iniury done to his death and bloud shedding, which if it be not a full aunswering of Gods iustice, and a perfect purging of all our sinnefull life, in vaine shall we seeke it else where. But I will reason with <hi>M. Allen</hi> in his owne principles. What say you Sir? remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth there some part of Gods iustice to be aunswered by suffering? Surely, if the passion of Christ will not serue, that was the immaculate lambe of God, it were straunge that the suffering of a sinnefull man should satisfie the same.</p>
               <p>And if suffering of the party that hath sinned be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required, for aunswering some part of Gods iustice, howe can the same suffering be mitigated by masses, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, merites, &amp;c. or cleane taken away by a pardon of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bely, <hi>à poena, &amp; culpa</hi>? Againe, howe can the merites of an other, abate his punishment, which must suffer him selfe to aunswere Gods iustice? If the iustice of God be not aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by the offering of Christ, how is it aunswered, when any mans suffering is by any of your meanes mollified or taken away? But it sufficeth you that your forefathers, more then a thousand yeares agoe, called that place of sufferance, purgatory. But I pray you what is it called in the Scripture? either of the olde testament or the newe, or in the first and second hundreth yeares after Christ? Diuerse errours be older then a thousand yeares, but age can neuer make fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoode to be truth, and therefore I waye not your proude bragges worth a strawe. I am one of the least of Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and not worthy, in respect of my greatest infirmities, of the lowest place in his Church, yet by his grace and the authoritie of his holy word, I shall be able to ouerthrowe, both this and all other babylonicall bulwarkes, that are cast

And as for the torment of conscience, by inward acknowedlging of the truth openly withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is not like you could so liuely describe it, if you had not experience of it in your selfe. Our consciences (most humble and harty thankes we yeald to the infinite mercy of God) are washed white and purged from all blacknes, by the precious bloud of Christ, which is the propitiation for our sinnes, that cleaue vnto him by true &amp; liuely faith: and open iudgement shall one day shew, that all obstinate Papistes, which seeke to establish their owne iustice, shal be voyde of the iustice of God, &amp; while they wrastle to come out of purgatory, they take the high way to fall headlong into hell. God lighten the eyes of them that are blinde of simplicitie, and confound all such as sinne of malicious wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes.

constant confession of the same truth, I receaue also that which you affirme, that the benefit of his death, extendeth also to the members of his mystical body. But in that which you make to be the onely meane, whereby the same is conueyed and applyed vnto vs, I can not but dissent from your iudgement. For the meane on Gods behalfe, by which we are made partakers of the fruites of Christes passion, and so grafted into his body, is his holy spirite of promise, which is the earnest and assuraunce of our inheritaunce, who worketh in vs fayth, as the onely meane by which the righteousnes of Christ is applyed vnto vs. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. And as for the Sacraments, which you seeme to make the onely condittes of Gods mercy, we are taught in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they are the seales of Gods promises geuen for the confirmation of our fayth, as was circumcision to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> when he was iustified before through faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. You will vs in the margent, to marke the grounde of your cause, which is in deede a good admonition. For seeing the grounde of your cause leaneth vpon your one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmation, and is contrary to thautority of Gods word, iniurious to the spirite of God, and neglecting the fayth of Christ, what so euer you buyld thereuppon, must needes be like the foundation. But howe shoulde your free will be maintayned? if Gods spirite had any place, that distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth to euery one according to the good pleasure of his owne will. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And how should the Sacrament geue grace of the worke wrought? if fayth were requisite in them that receiue them. Of like authority it is, which you say, that like effect is not geuen to all the Sacramentes. Surely all the Sacramentes of Christes institution, haue lyke effect in Gods elect. But let vs heare your difference. By baptisme all sinne committed before, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, is clearely forgeuen, by the Sacrament of penaunce, though the sinne be forgiuen, yet there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a temporal punishment. When the Pope geueth a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral pardon <hi>à poena &amp; culpa,</hi> doth he not it by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrament of penaunce? if he do it by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sacrament, then are temporall paines also remitted therby. Thus one falshod ouerthroweth

an other. But Christ you say the author of this sacrament, meant not to communicate such efficacie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o this, as to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme. Here are two assertions, first of the author, then of the force of this Sacrament, but neither of both able to be proued by the word of God. Neuerthelesse here is brought in that which is thought to be the piller, not onely of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, but also of all other popish satisfactions: namely the chastisement and correction, that God ministreth to his children, whose sinnes he hath pardoned, which is not a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the sinnes past, but a warning for the time to come, and is neuer accompted in scripture, for an answering of Gods iustice, but a token of his mercy, being not the punishment of a iudge, but the chastisement of the father to the amendement of his childe that suffereth, and for an admonition of other, that they likewise offend not. <hi>Heb:</hi> 12.

               <p n="2">2 Now commeth in the colourable confirmation of this false proposition, and that by examples of the holy Scripture, which must therefore more diligently be wayed, because they are so seldom alleged. But first he must rayle a crash at the forsaken Protestantes, which would so gladly liue at ease in their onely faith, that they list neither to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for their sinnes, nor to procure Gods mercy with good workes. Doubtles (<hi>M. Allen</hi>) they list not by seeking to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie them selues, procure to be forsaken of God. But you Papistes are they, that seeke to iustifie your selues, like the olde pharisees, and boast of your prayers, fastings and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions, but God knoweth what you are within. As for our onely faith shall stand before God, when your infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity shall condemne you, and the fruites of our onely faith shall appeare to Gods glory, when the vayne bragge of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2890:82"/>
your meritorius workes shalbe discouered to your eternall shame. But to come to your examples, I must admonish the Reader, that neither your wit, memory, diligence, nor lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, deserueth any commendations, for alleging them that haue so often before bene abused, by all them that of your side haue defended your cause, of whom you are but a <hi>translator</hi> or borower, not an <hi>author</hi> or obseruer your self. And therefore I might iustly referre the Reader to the learned and godly aunswers of so many, as haue impugned this heresie before, but because euery man either can not or will not seeke further then this booke, I will briefly aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere euery example, as it is an easy matter to doe, they are so vnfitly applyed to the purpose for which they are alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. The first example is of our first parent <hi>Adam,</hi> whose sinne though it were pardoned through Christ, yet he and all his posterity feeleth the punishment thereof. An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very farre fetched to maintayne the paynes of purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. The miseries of this life in that they be common to the godly, with the wicked, they sufficiently declare, that they are no satisfaction for sinne, but a demonstration of our miserable condition to humble vs, &amp; make vs desirous of restitution by Christ. And although they were enioyned by the curse of God against sinne, yet to those that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the curse of God by the blessed seede <hi>Iesus,</hi> they also are conuerted into blessings. Hereof the godly reioyse in afflictions, knowing that afflictions worke pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, patience worketh trial, triall hope, and hope confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, yea by them we are made conformable vnto Christ, that suffering with him we may raigne with him. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. As for that which <hi>Adam</hi> suffered after his death, when you haue declared it, then will I also confute it. Next followeth the examples of the <hi>Israelites</hi> which often fell, were punished and rose againe. The former example was not so farre of in tyme, as this is in matter, for that example although it were impertinent, yet it had some similitude with the cause, for that <hi>Adam</hi> was pardoned, and yet bare some part of punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But here are brought in the whole people, among whom many were wicked, and commonly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2890:83"/>
more hypocrites then true Israelites, and yet the very text alleged out of the 88. Psalme, declareth that the godly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which were punished, were chastised in mercy, and not condemned by iustice. And as for the saying of God. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. that notwithstanding he had pardoned the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, yet he would visit their sinne in the day of vengeance, litle helpeth the matter. For the pardon was generall to the whole people, that he would not destroy them from being a nation, as appeareth in the 14. verse of that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but not perticular to euery one, that he would remitte their sinne &amp; take them into his fauour, as appeareth verse 33. where he sayth, that who so euer had sinned he would put him out of his booke. The same answere serueth for the like text. <hi>Num.</hi> 14. But <hi>Moises</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron</hi> are examples of this matter most manifest. I answere to the punishment of <hi>Moises</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron,</hi> as to the punishment of all other faithfull persons, they were not to satisfie the iustice of God, but to declare his mercy in admonishing them, and others by their examples, how odious sinne is vnto him, and yet euen the chastisement of God is a benefite vnto his children, not onely because it is a signe of his fatherly loue toward them, but also because he conuerteth it alwaies vnto their reward and profit. As in the example of <hi>Moises</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> it was a fatherly rodde to discharge them of guiding Gods people, and entring into the lande of promise: but in the meane time it was a great benefite that they were dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of a heauy and troublesome burden, and entred soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into that land of eternall life, whereof the other was but a signe and shadow. And therefore the <hi>Psalmist</hi> sayth iustly of them, that God was mercifull vnto them, in reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their inuentions. But because <hi>S. Augustines</hi> words may be of more credit with you, he sayth of the death of <hi>Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron,</hi> that they were <hi>signa futurorum non supplicia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignationis Dei.</hi> Signes of things to come not punishments of Gods displeasure. <hi>Quaestion. Num. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Quest.</hi> 53. But the example of King <hi>Dauid</hi> is counted a great and speciall bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke of this cause, which notwithstanding is answered e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the rest. <hi>Dauid</hi> the child of God, was beaten with
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2890:83"/>
the mercifull rodde of Gods fatherly correction, and set as an example to Gods children of all ages, to shew how God abhorreth murder and adultery. And although the payne were bitter for the tyme, as all chastisment is, yet no doubt but he receaued great profite thereby. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. And as for the plague for numbring the people, it fell vpon them for their own sinnes, as the text is playne. The saying of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> that God leaueth no sinne vnpunished, which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: if it be vnderstood that all the sinnes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are punished in Christ, which became sinne for vs, it is most true. But if he meane that God punisheth all sinnes that he pardoneth in the partyes them selues, it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the manifest worde of God, and infinite examples of the Scripture. The Publicane, the prodigall childe, the debters, all clearely remitted, doe playnly proue that God freely forgiueth, iustifieth, rewardeth the penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, without exacting any punishment of them for aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering of the debt, satisfying for the sinnes, abusing his fatherly clemency. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. Finally for auouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myne aunswer, I would wish no better authority of the auncient fathers, then euen that which <hi>M. Allen</hi> him selfe allegeth out of <hi>Augustine contra Faustum, lib.</hi> 23. <hi>cap.</hi> 67. that the punishment of <hi>Dauid,</hi> was <hi>flagelli paterni disciplina,</hi> the chastisement of Gods fatherly scourge, as he doth most playnly declare the same in his booke <hi>de peccatorum meritis ac remissione, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. and for a flatt conclusion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory to <hi>M. Allens</hi> assertion, I will vse the very wordes of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in the 8. Hom. vppon the Epistle to the <hi>Rom.

And therefore bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impudently, as in case of this necessity, he aduentureth to deny with shame, that any of all these painfull miseries be as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments for the sinnes of the sufferers: but certaine fatherly checkes, exercises of patience and vertue, rather then afflictions enioyned for sinnes. VVhich vaine shift hath no bearing by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or text of Scripture: but onely is vpholden by the exercised audacity of the author.</p>

CAP. II.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F <hi>M. Allens</hi> titles of his chapters were as sufficient reasons, as they be bolde affirmations, there were no man able to stand against him. But I can well compare them to the arguments of those vayne fables that were wont to be printed in english of <hi>Beuis of Hampton, Guy of VVarwick,</hi> &amp; such like, where the arguments shew how such a Knight ouercame such a Gyant, how such a sorcerer wrought such a miracle, which are tould as confidently as though they were true, and yet there is no man of meane witte so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt, but he knoweth them to be fayned fantasies. Euen so with <hi>M. Allen,</hi> to affirme is to proue, to deny is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, briefly in his titles, and at large in his chapters. But if he would as he pretendeth, haue remoued all those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that we bring against his false conclusion, or any of them all, he must haue proued, that Christ hath not satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the iustice of God perfectly by his death and suffering, that God doth not freely forgeue vs our sinnes, that he is stil an angry Iudge against them that put their trust in him. He must haue proued against <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> that what tyme so euer a man doth truely repent, the Lord doth not put all his sinnes out of his remembraunce, against <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he hath not remoued our sinnes from vs as farre as the East is from the West. Against <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> that if any man sinne after Baptisme, Iesus Christ is not our aduocate with the father, and propitiation for our sinnes. If he could say any thing against these reasons &amp; authorities, with an hundred more of the same sort, he were worthy to be heard. But because that is to hard a matter for him to take in hand, without all shame or shew of truth most impudently, he fayneth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety betwene <hi>Melanthon</hi> and <hi>Caluine,</hi> but not once no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by one letter where the same is to be found in any of their workes, lest their manifest wordes out of the same places being brought against him, should reproue his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2890:85"/>
shamelesse lying. <hi>Melancthon</hi> he saith, acknowledgeth some temporal payne after remission of sinnes, to be discharged in this life, but not in the life to come. <hi>Caluin</hi> wil haue none at all. O brasen face and yron forhead: doth <hi>Caluine</hi> deny thafflictions of this life? or <hi>Melancthon</hi> affirme that they are suffered for satisfaction of our sinnes. Doth <hi>Melancthon</hi> deny the passion of Christ to be a perfect aunswering of the iustice of God? or <hi>Caluine</hi> affirme, thereby to be taken away the mercyfull correction of God? Would God that all that professe the religion of Christ agreed in all pointes as truely, as they doe in this. But admitte that <hi>M. Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> or any man beside, should graunt, that the sufferinges of the godly in this life, are some parte of satisfying vnto the iustice of God, what were purgatory promoted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? Forsoth then of necessitie it must be induced, that some parte of these sufferinges are aunswerable in the next worlde to come, what necessitie call you this? euen such as he suffereth, which being bounde hande and foote with a strawe, can not steare to helpe him selfe. But lette vs see this adamantine chayne of <hi>Maister Allens</hi> necessity. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny punishment remayne, it must needes ryse by proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, weyght, continuaunce, number and quantity, which if it be not all discharged in this lyfe, then it is to be aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered in the lyfe to come. By proportion <hi>Maister Allen?</hi> What proportion? <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> or <hi>Geometricall?</hi> If it be by <hi>arithmeticall</hi> proportion, then so many thousandes of sinnes, whereof euery one deserueth one death, must be punished by so many thousand deathes. If by <hi>geometricall</hi> proportion, then so many offences committed against that infinite maiesty, can not be aunswered, but by infinite and eternal punishment, and which way so euer you take it, by weight, number, time or measure, it is euident, that while you seeke for purgatory, you haue founde out hell. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise saith the spirite of God, in the person of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>He hath not dealt with vs according to our sinnes, neither rewarded vs after our iniquities, Psal.</hi> 103. <hi>But as heauen is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the earth, so great is his mercy, as a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lorde compassion on them that feare
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2890:85"/>
him.</hi> This is an other maner of proportion <hi>M. Allen,</hi> then you Papists can skill of, which thinke such a necessity to be of this conclusion, that if any sinnes be punished in this life, they must be punished after this life also. For if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but iustice be sought against sinnes, then followeth nothing but eternal damnation, if mercy may moderat the matter, what necessity is in this consequence? some sinnes are sometime punished in this life, <hi>ergo</hi> in the life to come. Thus I haue reasoned, supposing that any man had graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the iustice of God must be satisfied with our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in this life: for I my selfe had rather see the Pope at the deuill, then I would affirme the sufferings of Christ to be vnsufficient to aunswere perfectly the iustice of God. But behold christian reader the blasphemy of these popish ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, first they will seeme in wordes throughly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the benefite of Christes passion, lest that euery man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heareth them speak, should spit at them. When they haue thus obtained audience, then they will gather in them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, &amp; begin in some part to diminish the perfection ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, &amp; so proceede vntill they haue in deede, though not in wordes cleane excluded Christ and all his merits, whereof thou hast a plaine example in this hipocrite, who in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his first chapter, confesseth liberally the effect of Christes death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afterward restraineth the force thereof, to sinnes committed before baptisme, then bringeth in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, for aunswering the iustice of God in this life, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward extendeth the same vnto the life to come, &amp; last of all, estemeth the punishment by proportion, weight, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, number &amp; quantity of the faults committed: which of necessity thrusteth backe againe the sinnes into eternall torments. And what then becommeth of the propitiation for our sinnes purchased vnto vs by the bloud of the sonne of God?</p>

VVhat a vaine absurdity is this, that the prophet offending once or twise in all his time, shoulde suffer so heuie iudgement: and the party which abideth in wickednesse till the ende of his life, when sinne rather leaueth him, then he sinne, must because of his late conuersion, without paine be caried at ease to heauen?

                  <p>And because this toucheth our matter, and the very point thereof: I will stand with the aduersarie the longer. Here then I aske him, why God taketh punishment in this worlde, for sinne already remitted? His aunswere must needes be, for the reuenge and hatered of sinne, and satisfying of iustice. Nowe then doth God practise iudgement and iustice no where but in this worlde? Or if it be not here aunswered, because of lacke of space, or late reconciliation of the offender, shall our lorde of necessitie be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to remitte the debte, and release his sentence of iustice for lacke of meanes to punish in an other worlde? No no, Gods ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de is not abbridged by the termes of this life. Late repentaunce can be a benefit to no man: God forbid it shoulde. Especially seing punishment and iudgement for sinne (as many learned do sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and as reason with scripture beareth) properly apperteineth not to this worlde, but by a speciall grace, and singular benefite, which God of pity graunteth to such as he loueth, that they may here preuent his anger: which else in the next life should be found more greeuous, where properly is the reward of sinne, and iudgement kept ordinarily for the same. As it is playne mercy &amp; grace, when man may take punishment of him selfe (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> sayeth) and be his owne correctour,<note place="margin">

And therefore that which is the chiefe cause, that doth and ought to moue, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ende for which all godly men are moued to seeke to please God by good workes, namely the loue of God, and the glory of God, the Papistes thinke to preuaile with no man, because they are voyd of it them selues. But may not a man now iustly enforce, that the opinion of purgatory &amp; satisfactions of sinnes after this life, is the very doctrine of licentiousnes, to maintayne wicked men in their presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes? For what hast will they make to amendement &amp; newnes of life, when they haue hope of release after their death? The other absurdity riseth of deuilish enuy, that God shoulde be more liberall to them that repent, at the

Allen</hi> is a cunning Logitian, if he can draw a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument out of this place to proue that God punisheth his children to satisfy his iustice. The whorish church of Rome is iustly condemned to eternal torments, for her pride &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnes, there ore Gods children are punished to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the iustice of God.

This is a fine kinde of reasoning, <hi>M. Allen,</hi> that you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force your aduersary both to aunswere you, &amp; also to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere what you list, &amp; then you are good enough for him. Is this the logicke of <hi>Louayne?</hi> Nay you haue a finer reason then this, punishment &amp; iudgement for sinne properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayneth not to this worlde, but to the next life. Then would I grossely inferre, therfore the temporal paines that the godly suffer in this world, be not properly punishments for sinne. But it is of mercy and grace that they suffer in this life, that I graunt, but not to satisfie for their sinnes.

But to take your owne affirmation and not to charge you with dissention of other men (because you dissent so much from your selfe) who so weigheth the grounde of your first booke, must needes confesse that it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturneth your second booke, &amp; if the matter of your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke be true, then is the ground of your first booke false. For the ground of purgatory you would make the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God, which requireth punishment for sinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in this life: but how can that stand? if God accept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke of other men to release them, that should suffer by his iustice: if these workes wil answere the matter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no such necessity of purgatory to satisfie his iustice.

As for the saying of <hi>Augustine</hi> helpeth you nothing at all, onely he sheweth that God punisheth not all sinnes in this world, because many are reserued to eternall torments.

               <p n="4">4 This man hath hitherto raked in purgatory, nowe he will steppe a foote further into hell, and all to finde a case where sinnes remitted are punished after this life, and then he will returne againe into purgatory. For this purpose we must consider with him, that <hi>Adam</hi> and all the iust of those dayes, were punished for their sinnes forgiuen, not onely in this life, but many hundreth yeares after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. For whose deliuery the Catholike Church (he sayth) holdeth &amp; our creed teacheth, that Christ descended into hell. First marke how he agreeth with him selfe, &amp; after how he cauilleth with the holy Scripture of God. Here he sayth that <hi>Abraham</hi> and all the iust were punished in hell, afterward in the next leafe, he saith that all the iust in those inferiour partes were not in like felicity with our father <hi>Abraham,</hi> or other of such perfect holinesse, and in the next leafe after that, he affirmeth out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> happy resting place can not be found in Scripture, to be termed hell. But that the fathers of the olde lawe before Christ, were not in hell, although they were not, nor yet are in perfect blessednesse, God prouiding a better thing for vs, that they without vs shoulde not be made perfect. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. It is to be proued with manifest argumentes and authorityes out of holy Scriptures. For seeing they all beleeued in Christ, they had euerlasting lyfe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred not into condemnation, but passed from death to lyfe. <hi>Ioan</hi> 5. And to what ende was Christ called the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:2890:91"/>
lambe, that was slayne from the beginning of the worlde, but that the benefite of his passion, extendeth vnto the godly of all ages alike? <hi>Esay</hi> speaking of thè righteous that are departed out of this life, sayth that there is peace, and that they shall rest in their beddes, <hi>Esay</hi> 57. like as he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that <hi>Tophoth,</hi> which is <hi>Gehinnom</hi> or hell, is prepared of olde for the wicked, <hi>Es.</hi> 30. So that felicity and rest was the portion of the godly fathers of the olde time after their death: and hell was prepared but for the wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. The same doth our Sauiour Christ teach in the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and the rich man. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. where the soule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was caried by Angels not downe to hell, but vp into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, from which hell is manifestly deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, when it is sayd that the rich man being in hell in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lifted vp his eyes and saw <hi>Lazarus</hi> a farre of: which wordes doe plainly confute, that drousy dreame of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes concerning <hi>limbus patrum,</hi> which they say is but an edge and border of hell. But Christ maketh hell one place, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome an other, and not that onely, but the one farre from the other, yea a great distaunce betwene the one and the other, therfore no edge nor border of hell, but a place of comfort, an high place: for the rich man loketh vp, and seeth a farre of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the bosome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was a true childe of <hi>Abraham</hi> by fayth, for fayth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth children vnto <hi>Abraham. Rom.</hi> 4. And euen as faith was imputed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> so is it to all that be his children by fayth as well as it was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> if righteousnes belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, the reward of righteousnes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so pertayneth vnto them, therefore <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome was open to receiue all the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> euen as the bosome of God was ready to receiue <hi>Abraham,</hi> because he was his sonne through fayth. And now to confute your vaine reasons which eyther be manifest wrestinges of the holy Scripture, or else are builded vpon the authority of mortall men. First you allege that the place into which Christ descended, was called a lake without water, in which the godly fathers were. <hi>Zachary</hi> 9. but this is so euident an abusing of the word of God, that he which doth only reade
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:2890:91"/>
that verse of <hi>Zachary</hi> in the originall tongue, must needes confesse, that those wordes haue an other sense, for God there contineweth his speaking to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Syon</hi>: saying, he hath deliuered her prisoners by the bloud of her couenant, from the lake without water, that is from miserable and desperate captiuity, where appeared no comfort. For the pronoune <hi>thou,</hi> is of the feminine gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, wherefore it is most cleare that this is not spoken of Christ but of the Church of Christ. As for the common translation, which turneth the feminine gender into the masculine, &amp; the first person into the second with manifest deprauation of the sense, is not to be admitted in this case. Nowe that prison which you bring out of 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. is the prison of the damned soules, into which <hi>S. Peter</hi> doth not say that Christ descended, but that he came in the daies of <hi>Noe</hi> by his spirite, and preached to those that were then disobedient, and therefore are their spirites now in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall prison and torment. And this is the true and naturall sense of <hi>S. Peters</hi> wordes, which by meanes of that predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate errour, rather then of any great obscurity in them, hath bene diuersly wrested by expositors. The wordes of <hi>Irenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> may be well vnderstoode of Christes comming downe from heauen to saue mankind, which deserued iust condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for sinne, rather then of his descending into hel, and the name of <hi>Adam</hi> seemeth to be taken in these wordes, rather for a noune common then for a proper name. He hath wordes towards the latter ende of the fift booke that sound more like to this matter, where he sayth: <hi>Cum enim Dominus in medio vmbrae mortis abierit, vbi animae mortuorum erant, post deinde corporaliter resurrexit, &amp; post resurrectionem assumptus est, manifestum est, quia &amp; discipulorum eius, propte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> quos &amp; haec operatus est Dominus, animae abibunt in inuisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem locum, definitum eis à Deo, &amp; ibi vsque ad resurrectionem commorabuntur.</hi> Seing the Lord went in the middest of the shadow of death, where the soules of the dead were, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward arose corporally, and then was taken vp: it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that the soules of his disciples for whom the Lorde wrought these thinges, shall goe into an inuisible place, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2890:92"/>
for them by God, and there shall tarry vntill the resurrection. Neuertheles out of these wordes can nothing be necessarily enforced, but that the soule of Christ, when he was deade, was in the place of the godly that were deade before him, which no man denyeth. If you vrge that he was in the middest of the shadow of death, I aunswere, that is a phrase of the Scripture, signifying that he was verely dead, and that death had him in possession, after which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speach <hi>S. Peter</hi> sayth, that God raysed him agayne, loosing the sorrowes of death, and you your selfe count it a blasphemy to say, that he suffered any torments in hell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> him selfe affirmeth, that it was such a place as all his disciples shall rest in vntill the time of the generall resurrection, which plainly ouerthroweth your fantasy. <hi>Eusebius Emissenus</hi> helpeth you as litle as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> for he speaketh rhetorically, of the glorious victory that Christ obtained against hel, &amp; the power of darkenes, by his death and passion, and descending into hell, whose words if you would expounde grammatically, you will make a mad sense of them, &amp; he shalbe smally beholding vnto you. But it is plaine enough, except it be to him that wil seeke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of errors, out of that which is truely spoken, that he meaneth that the effect and power of Christes death, mightely vanquished the power of hell &amp; eternal damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not which it had actually ouer the godly, but which by the iustice of God, it should haue had, if his sacrifice had not purchased mercie. And therfore he saieth, <hi>Aeterna nox</hi> the euerlasting night, which adiectiue is referred also to the gnashing &amp; cheines of the damned. For it was eternall not temporall damnation, from which they were deliuered by Christes death. And therfore that fond shift, which <hi>M. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> imagineth, which he saith may seeme like to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors meaning, is not worth a straw, as being enforced and brought to the wordes by him, not expressed in them, by <hi>Eusebius.</hi> But when these wil not helpe, the supposal of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> is set downe, which because it is but the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a man, &amp; him not constant with him selfe alwayes, it is not of sufficient weight, to beare downe the testimony al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:2890:92"/>
out of Gods word. The same man <hi>contra Felicianum ad Optatum cap.</hi> 15. writeth these words. <hi>Si igitur mortuo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, ad paeradisum anima mox vocatur, quenquam ne adhuc tam impium credimus, qui dicere audeat, quoniam anima saluatoris nostri, triduo illo corporeae mortis apud inferos custodiae mancipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> If therefore the body being dead, the soule is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly called to paradise, beleue we yet that there is any man so vngodly, that he dare say, that our Sauiours soule, in that 3. daies of his bodily death, was committed to prison in hel, &amp;c. In these words, he semeth vtterly to deny, that he came in that prison of hel. You wil say he denieth that he tarried there so long, but not that he came not there at all. But then marke this reason, if the soules of good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> immediatly are called to paradise, much more was Christes soule immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly receiued into paradise, who committed the same into his fathers handes.</p>

               <p n="1">1 BEcause this man would shew him selfe mindeful of his promise hereafter, he is euen now wandered out of Purgatory into excommunication, which notwithstanding he counteth no digression at

all, because it doth set forth the order of Gods iustice in the next life, and proue Purgatory, which were neither so nor so, but that he hath a speciall grace, to make all thinges serue his purpose, though they be neuer so farre from it. <hi>Omnia ex omnibus,</hi> he can make what he liste of euery thing. We confesse the power of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion geuen by Christ vnto his Church, and the seueritie of the punishment thereof to be greater, then the swelling wordes of <hi>M. Allens eloquence</hi> can expresse: but where as he addeth, that it hath bene the perpetuall vsage of Gods church, for satisfying of Gods wrath, to enioyne penaunce and workes of correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before they would absolue, which was the olde custome, or els after the release of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence which was the new fashion, he sheweth him selfe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunte of the right vse and end of that auctoritie, which our Sauiour hath committed vnto his Church. For the chiefe ende of this discipline, is to bring the sinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, which if it may be obtained by admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the sworde of excommunication must not be drawen out. As appereth plainely by Christes owne wordes <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. If priuate admonition, where the offence is not publike, may preuaile to winne our brother, there needeth no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be called. If two or three may serue to admonish: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter neede not to be referred to the Churches know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and he that heareth the Church, so that by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition thereof he is brought to harty repentaunce, is not to be cut of from the Church, nor to be deliuered to Sathan, for how should the Church refuse him, whome God receiueth: But if he obstinatly contemne the gentle admonition of the Church, or as our Sauiour saieth, if he refuse to heare the Church, then let him be as an heathen or publicane. For afterwarde if being excommunicated: he shew harty tokens of repentaunce, without any further satisfaction, he is to be receiued againe, as appereth most manifestly, in the receiuing of that <hi>Corinthian</hi> which was excommunicated, of whose vnfeined repentaunce, when the Apostle had intelligence, he writeth againe to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians of him saying. It is sufficient for that same man
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2890:96"/>
that he was rebuked of many, but now you ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue him and comforte him, that he should not be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp with ouer much heuines. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. And as for the practise of the olde and puerer Church, by enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of workes of repentaunce, was, that they might not be deceiued by conterfect repentaunce, in stead of true and earnest reformation, not to satisfie the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinners (which is not satisfied, but by the bloude of Christ) but to satisfie and assure the Church (as much as man might iudge) of the vnfeined and hartie repentaunce of the offendour. For how so euer the olde writers vse the worde of satisfaction, somethinge vnproprely, yet their cleare affirmation of the onely satisfaction of Christes death, declareth what they vnderstoode, when they vsed that terme in an other sense. But this is not to be omitted, that <hi>M. Allen</hi> confesseth the Papistes, to haue left the olde vsage of the Church, which was first to set satisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and then to absolue, and now of late, to haue taken vp a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary custome that is, first to absolue then to enioyne pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. This practise therefore lacketh antiquitie, one of the chiefe pillers of Popery. But this he sayeth is for great causes, but what causes, he doth not expresse: it is sufficient that the Church can not erre, though they doe that which is contrary to the vsage of the auncient Church, without grounde of Scripture, and against the commaundement of Christ. How harde <hi>Cyprian</hi> was to absolue them, that were excommunicate, before they had shewed great fruites of repentaunce, and how carefull, that the Church should not be deceiued by them, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> counterfected penau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, required absolution, appereth by many of his epistles, &amp; in his Sermon <hi>De lapsis.</hi> But because we shall haue a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place to speake of satisfaction in the next Chapter, we will now follow <hi>M.

Who hath suffered sorrow for vs, whome God hath geuen for our sinnes. A man can not be greater, then God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the seruaunt by his indulgence remit or forgeue that which by so great offence is committed against the Lorde, lest this offence also be added to him that is fallen away, if he know not that it is fore shewed.

and though, by some outwarde obseruations, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Church, might know they had to doe with God, who was not pleased, but with inwarde and harty conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whose knowledge they must satisfie, with true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce in deede, as they seeke to satisfie iudgement of the Church by externall signes and tokens thereof. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the common case of Christian men, (for the Popes cases be out of the common case of christen men) <hi>M. Allen</hi> sayth penaunce (and by penaunce he still meaneth punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is for no other cause enioined, but to saue them from more greeuous torment in the world following. In deede true repentaunce deliuereth men from eternall torments, but what is this to purgatory? euen as much as the saying of <hi>Augustine,</hi> by him alleged, where he sayth that God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth in this life with temporall paynes those, whose sins are pardoned, lest they should be reserued <hi>in finem,</hi> that is for euer, which is to be chastised by the Lord, lest we should be damned with the world, of which matter enough hath bene sayd already. To conclude this chapter (because the wordes following contayne nothing but a vayne repetition of that which he hath often sayd before) the censure of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, with the power of binding and loosing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth still inuiolable to the Church, nowe the opinion of purgatory is ouerthrowne, as it did before the doctrine of purgatory euer came into the world.</p>

If <hi>Augustine</hi> coulde haue founde Purgatory out of <hi>Amplius laua me,</hi> he would haue vttered it there, where he expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth those wordes, whereby it appereth plainely that <hi>M. Allens</hi> argument standeth vpon his owne inuention, and not vpon <hi>Augustines</hi> authoritie. But yet <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh of the amending fier in the place by him alledged. He doth so in deede: but I haue shewed before, and more will shew hereafter, that as <hi>Augustine</hi> had no ground of that fier, but in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon error of his time, so sometimes he affirmeth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2890:101"/>
that it is a matter, that may be doubted of sometimes that there is no third place at all. And that he hath no grounde of Scripture in that place of the 38. Psalme, is euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth that God will not punish him in his fury, nor in his wrath, for when so euer he punisheth in his fury and plagueth in his wrath, they must needes perish e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, he prayeth therefore, that that sicknes or other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; which God hath layd vpon him, might be a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full chastisement of a father, and not a iust punishment of a iudge. But whereas the vnpure mouth of this. <hi>Allen</hi> is once agayne opened in rayling against the godly preachers of our Church as flatterers of men in daungerous diseases, I would he might heare the children of thunder, inueying with mighty power of Gods spirite against sinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and calling men to true &amp; vnfayned repentaunce, peraduenture he might be moued to cease his sclaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for shame of the worlde, if he did not forethinke him of his wickednes for feare of God. But <hi>Nabuchodonizer</hi> had a sore corrosiue playster applyed to him, that healed him, and that was almes &amp; mercy toward the poore. He might haue alleged many examples, and none lesse fitte to shew what paynfull penaunce, (as he termeth it) was enioyned by godly prophets. For it was the easiest that could be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to so rich a prince, for so great offences, to be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to the poore. Although <hi>Dauid</hi> in that place, cited by him, speaketh of no redemption of sinnes, as that corrupt &amp; false translation which he followeth, doth seeme to talke of. But <hi>Daniel</hi> willed <hi>Nabuchodoniser</hi> to breake of thacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed course of his cruelty and tyranny, by almes and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality. The Niniuites in deede by fasting and lamenting, but most of all by turning from their wicked wayes, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their harty repentaunce: and <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> requireth the fruites of repentaunce, and what godly preacher doth not so? but where did <hi>Nathan, Daniel, Ionas, Iohn Baptist</hi> speake one word of purgatory? or of satisfying the iustice of God for their sinnes by such meanes.</p>

I make small accompt of that which I often finde concerning Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the auncient writers, for I perceiue diuers of them, shall I be plaine with you? in a maner euery one that euer wrote till this daye, in this point to haue bene fouly deceiued, or spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more roughly then they shoulde haue done. Is not this a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a lone? whether thinke you now our English bragger cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the doctors to be on his parte, or this man confessing plainely that they be all against him, and yet setting not a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by them all, whether thinke you is more arrogant? I am sure <hi>Caluine</hi> dealeth here more sincerely, and the other more deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. If craking had bene a maisterie in sommer games as lying is, our man might haue wone of all the worlde, two games at a clappe. But there is no remedy he must yelde to the learned that haue opened his impudencie. Therefore I leaue him, and take the benefit of this his maisters confession for further confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of my cause, doubting nothing but that most wise men, seeing by the aduersaries graunt all learned fathers to be on our side, will accept it either as a full proofe, or no small presumption of that trueth which we defend.</p>

I will aunswere in a worde or two.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Caluine</hi> hath most substantially proued, both by authority of holy Scripture, and also by consent of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient doctors, that their is no satisfaction vnto God for our sinnes, but onely the death of Christ, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth at length,

to speake of the worde of satisfaction, which sayth he, as it is often vsed in the olde writers, so sometime hardely, as improperly (that <hi>M.

And for this purpose, he sheweth at large, which might haue bene vttered in briefe, that the corruption of mans sinnefull nature is so great, and the perfection of dignitie, whereunto we are called so high, as man, except he be throughly purged, is no meete person to be partaker ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But lest he should be thought here to forget the perfect restitution by Christ, he confesseth the perfect purgation of our sinnes to be wrought by his blood, yet he sayth, it is not meete that the might of that mercy should worke in this freedom of our will, without all paine or trauell of the offenders. This is to geue with one hand, and to pull away with the other hand. But that this enemy of the crosse of Christ, shall not thus passe away with his reseruations and exceptions, that which he graunteth, we will take at the hand of God, and not of this vnpure blasphemer: who by his holy spirite teacheth vs that the blood of Christ doth purge vs from all our sinnes: &amp; being washed by him we are throughly cleane. <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. So that although our sinnes were as redd as scarlet, they are made as white as snowe. <hi>Esay</hi> 1. Then being throughly purged, washed &amp; clensed as white as snow, we are made capable of the heauenly inheritaunce and the fruition of eternall glory. And if any man had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleue an Angell, before <hi>M. Allen,</hi> an elder of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly consistory, sooner then a yong palting proctor of purgatory: Let him heare what is sayd to <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, 7. cap. whereby is declared by what priuilege, al the faithfull departed appeare in innocency before the throne of God. <hi>These are they</hi> (sayth the Angel) <hi>that came out of that great affliction, and haue washed their stoles and made them white in the bloud of the lambe: therefore they are in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the throne of God, and serue him day and night, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:2890:111"/>
Mark here that they which came out of this great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were not purged thereby, after <hi>M. Allens</hi> fantasy, but that they washed and made white their garments, in the bloud of the lambe, by whose righteousnes they being clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, may appeare in innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy before the throne of God. As for that which is cited out of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> of the fiery sword, is ment of the sorrow of repentaunce, and with no equity can be racked to the paynes of purgatory.</p>

First the prophet and Apostle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> both, make mention of purging &amp; of purifying sinne, &amp; corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans impure or defiled workes: they both agree this clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or trying out of the filthy drosse gathered by corruption of sinne, to be done by fier: they both throughly follow the similitude <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the fornace and goldesmith in fining his metalles, and trying out the drosse and base matter from the perfect finesse of more worthy substaunce: they both plainely vtter their meaninges of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> such as shall afterwarde be saued, though it be with losse: geuing vs to vnderstande, that the parties so purged, shall be after their triall worthy to offer a pure sacrifice in holynesse &amp; righteousnes: They both note this purgatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be wrought by the hand of God.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> All these must needes be confessed, euen of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary teachers: which things together, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine more probability for the proofe of our purpose, then they can for any other sense finde. But now tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the text neerer, and finding that this worke of mans amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding shall be wrought in the next life, then it must nedes so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this sense, that no meaning may well be admitted, which euidently setteth not forth the trueth of Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>And that this worke is not properly taken for any such trouble or vexation that may fall to man in this life, but for a very tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prepared for the next worlde, first the quality of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> &amp; meanes in the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that sentence of God (which

is named to be done by fier) seemeth rather to import that, then any other vexation, the punishment of the worlde following al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> lightely so termed. Then man is in this purging onely a sufferer, which belongeth namely to the next worlde. But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that this sentence shal be executed in the day of our Lord, which properly signifieth either the day of our death, or the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God which streight followeth vpon death: or the last and generall iudgement. All the time of mans life wherein he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth his freedome, is called <hi>Dies Hominis:</hi> the day of man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as man in this life for the most parte serueth his owne will, so he often neglecteth Gods: but at his death, there beginneth <hi>Dies Domini:</hi> VVhere God executeth his ordinaunce and will vpon man. This triall then of mans misdeedes &amp; impure workes, must either be at his death, or after his departure by one of the two iudgements. But if we note diligently the circumstances of the saide letter, it shall appeare vnto vs, that this purgation was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not ment to be onely at mans death: both because it shall be done by fire, which (as is saide) commonly noteth the torment of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> next life: and then <hi>S. Paule</hi> expressely warneth vs to take heede what we builde, in respect of the difference that may fall to such as builde fine workes, and other that erect vpon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, impure or mixte matter of corruption: but the paines of death being common to the best, as well as to the worst or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and no lesse greuous in it selfe to one then the other, can not be imported by the fire which shall bring losse to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> one sort, and not paine the other. Besides all this, that day which the Prophet speaketh of, shall be notorious in the sight of the worlde and very terrible to many: And <hi>Saint Paule</hi> plainely affirmeth, that in this iudgement there shall be made an open shewe of such workes as were hidde before from man, and not discerned by the iudgement of this worlde: which the priuate death of one man can not do.<note place="margin">

First <hi>Malachy</hi> prophecieth plainly of the first comming of Christ, and of his fore runner <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> as the wordes going before, without all controuersy doe declare. <hi>Behold I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord whom ye seeke, shall spedely come to his temple, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the messenger of the couenaunt whom ye desire, beholde he shall come sayth the Lord of hostes, but who may abide the day of his comming, &amp;c.</hi> witnesse of this is no lesse, then euen our Sauiour Christ him selfe, <hi>Luke</hi> the 7. alleging this saying of

the Prophet, for the comming of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist. These wordes also, where it is sayd <hi>that the Lord shall come into his temple,</hi> doe sufficiently declare, that he describeth the office of Christ, in reforming the corrupt state of the Church at his first comming, and not in iudging the quicke and the dead at the last appearing. Finally the exact triall and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that he speaketh of, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> discouering of hypocrites by his doctrine, wherof also <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> preacheth, <hi>that his fan is in his hand, and he shall purge his floore, &amp;c.</hi> To conclude, that this may not be thought to be mine owne collection, it is the iudgement and interpretation of <hi>Ieronym</hi> vppon this very text <hi>Malachy</hi> the 3. in euery poynt: who with all his learning, coulde finde no purgatory fire spoken of in this cap.

First <hi>S. Paule</hi> speaketh not generally of all men, but of preachers onely that are buylders of Gods Church. Secondly he speaketh not of all their workes, but of their preaching or building onely. Thirdly he speaketh neuer a word of purging or making cleane of mens works, but of the triall of the worke of building which is doctrine. But what doctrine is tryed to be true or false, substantiall or superficiall by the fire of purgatory? Fourthly the workes are sayd that shall be tryed by fire, and not the persons. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the gold and siluer abideth, the strawe and stuble consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, through the fire of this triall, which is the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and not the paynes of purgatory. And this is the iudgement of <hi>Ieronym</hi> vpon the place of <hi>Malachy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rehearsed, where also he applyeth the text of <hi>Esay</hi> 4. before cited by <hi>M.

               <p n="1">1 THat the iudgement of God beginneth at the death of euery man and so continueth vntil the full manifestation therof in the last day, is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer by the Scripture of God, then that it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mans authoritie. But that <hi>Ambrose</hi> is alleged to proue, that euery man immediatly after his death, doth feele that he must looke for in the daye of iudgement, I meruaile to what purpose it is brought in, if it be not to ouerthrow purgatory. For if it be true, as it must needes be, no man feeleth paine after this life, but he that shall feele it eternally. And surely to the same effect he speaketh in his booke <hi>de bono mortis</hi> where he commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the death of the faithfull <hi>quia deteriorem statum non ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit, sed qualem in singulis inuenerit, talem iudicio fururo reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat,

Thus sayth <hi>Ambrose</hi> plainely in this place, what soeuer he speaketh allegorically of the fiery sword in other places. <hi>VVell it is euident</hi> (you saie) <hi>that the soules departed sleepe not, of which error Luther also was noted.</hi> I neuer harde any man of credit note him therof, who is well knowne to haue bene of a cleane contrary iudgement: but I reade in the actes of the Councel of Constance, that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23 was condemned for denying the immortality of the soule, the resurrection of the deade and the life euerlasting. But if the soules sleepe not, then they be awake in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or if ye reason not so subtilly, you meane, that if they be at all in purgatory, they be there immediatly after their departure out of their bodyes. But how shall we proue, that they come there at all? Forsooth by the sayings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and of the Apostle before alleged, which are so plaine proofe and so euident to be vnderstoode, of them selues, that they nede none other interpretation. But how plaine it is, that they serue nothing to that purpose, I haue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared already: yet must we further follow the same matter, because here are brought in the authoritie of the doctors to agree with <hi>M.

By the foresaide wordes in semeth very euident, that in the time of that iudgement there shall be certaine Purgatory paines for some sort of men. For when it is saide: <hi>Who can be able to susteine the day of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming? who can stand in his sight? because he shall sit trying out and purifying as it were golde and siluer, and entre in like the fier of the fornace, and as washers sope: he shall make cleane the sonnes of Leui &amp; shall trie them as golde and siluer:</hi> VVhat other thing by all these wordes can be ment?<note place="margin">

                     </note> (but purgatory paines.) Namely seeing the prophet Esaie hath the like in these wordes. <hi>God shall washe a waye the filthe of the sonnes and daughters of Syon, and purge bloude from the middest of them, in the spirite of iudgement and fier.</hi> Except a man might conueniently say that they shall be washed

from filthe, and as you would say newe fourged, when the wicked by finall iudgement are seuered out of their company: that so their departure and damnation may be the purgation of the rest, because after that day they shall liue for euer without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the badde. But when the Prophet sayth more, <hi>that he will clense the children of Leuy, and purify them as golde and siluer, that they may offer their oblations in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the sacrifice of Iuda and Hierusalem shall please our Lorde.</hi> He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this question of purgatory paines I will differ to a further treaty hereafter. All this hath <hi>S.

And he constantly as all other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes euer did, confesseth that the sinnes or vncleane workes of the liuing not duely by penaunce wiped away in this worlde, must be mended after our death: although it be very doubtefull in deede, whether there be any worldely affections left in mans mind vntaken vp by death and resolution of the body and the soule, the care and remembraunce whereof, might be afterward by sorrow both purged and punished.</p>

               <p n="2">2 Now followeth a confuse and tedious discourse of <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgement, touching <hi>Origens</hi> error, but it may be reduced vnto these two pointes. First why <hi>Augustine</hi> woulde not interprete that place of <hi>Paule.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory: and secondly whether <hi>Augustine</hi> were in any doubt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2890:123"/>
at all of purgatory, betwene which two questions is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten a thirde conclusion, that purgatory serueth onely for veniall and light offences. To the first he seemeth to say, that <hi>Augustine</hi> refuseth to vnderstand that place of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, either because he colde not otherwise withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the arguments of the Originests, or els because he woulde take all holde away from them, rather then that it was his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant iudgement, because in other places, where he was free from conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion he euer grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded purgatory vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that place. How honorable this aunswere is for <hi>Augustine,</hi> or how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall for <hi>Allen,</hi> vsing <hi>Augustines</hi> authoritie, I referre to be iudged of all them that be wise and learned. To the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he sayth, that <hi>Augustine</hi> neuer doubted, whether there were any paines of purgatory after this life, but whether men after their death reteined any carnall affections. I will once againe reherse the wordes of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, men may iudge, whether <hi>M. Allens</hi> aunswere may stande with his saying in a reasonable meaning. <hi>Tale ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid etiam post hanc vitam fieri incredibile non est: &amp; vtrum ita sit quaeri potest.</hi> It is not vncredible, that some such thing is doen after this life, and whether it be or no, it may be enquired of, that is (sayth <hi>M. Allen</hi>) whether men haue any carnall affection to their wiues, children &amp;c. after this life, it may be a question. But <hi>Augustine</hi> goeth further in the same place and sayth: <hi>Et aut inueniri aut latere, nonnullos fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deles, per ignem quendam purgatorium quanto magis minúsue, bona pereuntia dilexerunt, tanto tardius citiusque saluari. Non tamen tales de quibus dictum est, quod regnum Dei non posside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt, nisi conuenientes poenitentibus eadem crimina remittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> And either it may be founde, or still be hidde, that some of the faithfull, by a certaine purgatory fire, by how much they haue more or lesse loued transitory Gods, by so much later or soner, are they saued, but yet not such, of whome it is saued, that they shall not possesse the kingdome of God, except the same crimes be forgeuen them being suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently repentaunt for them. These wordes are so plaine against <hi>M. Allens</hi> new forged meaning, that I suppose he neuer reade them in <hi>Augustines</hi> owne bookes, but onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2890:124"/>
his notes of some elder Papists, that had spent more time in gathering them, but had not such audacity to vtter them as <hi>M. Allen,</hi> of which coniecture, there is no small likelyhoode sone after. I omitte his foolish supposition, if <hi>S. Augustine</hi> had but saied: <hi>belike there is no such meane place in the life following. &amp;c.</hi> I haue already with out <hi>M. Allens</hi> suppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shewed, that <hi>Augustine</hi> some where sayd, he knew neither thirde place, nor meane place, nor none coulde finde in the holy Scriptures, nor Gospell of God. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse with much wrangling to defende the vncerteinety or vnconstancy of <hi>Augustines</hi> iudgement touching purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, we haue wonne so much, that purgatory serueth to purge none but very smal and light offences. But how longe shall we holde this? Scarse to the latter ende of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For in the next capter, he findeth out a shifte to wring in heynous and deadly sinnes also.

But lest your kitchen shoulde be colde if none but veniall sinnes should passe through the heate of purgatory, you haue found out a sutle shifte, howe to bring mortall sinnes also through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same pykes of purgatory, for discharge of which you know men will bestow more cost, then for release of those, that with onely sprinckling of holy water, as you wott well, may be washed away. Therefore mortall sinnes must be remitted in this life, and then they may be purged in the fire of purgatory, as being now become in the case of veniall sinnes. O deepe mysteries reueiled out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse pitt, which haue no grounde at all in the word of God, but are manifestly ouerthrowne thereby, euen from the foundations. For the foundation of this doctrine, is the distinction of veniall and mortall sinnes, whereas the word of God plainly determineth, that euery sinne is mortall and deserueth eternall death, seeme it neuer so small. <hi>Cursed is euery one that abideth not in all thinges that are written in the law to fulfill them. Deu.</hi> 27. <hi>The soule that sinneth shall dye. Eze.</hi> 18. <hi>The reward of sinne is death. Rom.</hi> 6. And as for that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> maketh of a sinne to death, a sinne not to death, hath nothing common with that of the papistes, for all sinne that by the mercy of God is pardonable, he calleth a sinne not vnto death, for which God is entreated that giueth life to them that haue so sinned. And that sinne he counteth vnto death, which is irremissible, as obstinate &amp; wilful apostacy. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. blasphemy against the holy ghost. <hi>Math.</hi> 12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which it is not lawfull io pray. Thus by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2890:127"/>
iudgement of Gods word, are all sinnes mortall which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes call veniall, and all that they count mortall, by Gods spirite are counted veniall. For by the iustice of God, all sinnes are mortall, but by his mercy, they are all pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except that sinne vnto death, whereof <hi>S. Iohn</hi> speaketh. 1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 5. But to returne to <hi>M. Allens</hi> shift, and to examine whether it will satisfie the iudgement of those olde writers, which affirme that onely small and light offences are clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the fire of purgatory. <hi>M. Allen</hi> sayth, mortall sinnes become veniall, by remission. The Scripture teacheth that sinnes forgeuen are not imputed at all. But <hi>M. Allens</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, that remission of sinnes doth not take sinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way but onely chaungeth their nature, from mortall to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, yea he is not ashamed to vouch <hi>Augustine</hi> to warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as though he should say, that a mortall sinne forgiuen, is become a veniall trespasse, &amp;c. If all men were blinde, this fellow would play trimly with their noses, when he will be so bold with all men that can see: <hi>Augustines</hi> wordes as he citeth them in Latine are these. <hi>Quaedam enim sunt peccata quae mortalia sunt, &amp; in poenitentia fiunt venialia,</hi> that is, there are some sinnes which are deadly of their owne nature, but by repentaunce they are made veniall. I haue translated them as he doth, sauing that he calleth <hi>poenitentia</hi> penaunce which I, to auoyd the ambiguitie of the english word, as it is taken by the Papistes, haue turned repentaunce. Nowe is it all one to say, that such sinnes as of their owne nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue death, may yet be pardoned to him that repenteth? which is the manifest meaning of <hi>Augustines</hi> wordes, and that which <hi>M. Allen</hi> fathereth vpon him, as though he said, a mortall sinne forgeuen is become a veniall trespasse? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine this doctors wordes are playne of light and small of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and not of heynous and great offences, that by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don are made litle offences.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="2">2 VVell then, to close vp briefely, all this haue we founde by these scriptures alleaged: that being diuerse degrees of men, Purgatory apperteineth but to one sort. First not to such as lacke the faith of Christ, for they hauing no foundation are allready

iudged: neither to such as haue not builded vpon the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather defaced it with workes of death and deuilish doctrine. For all these must like widdred branches be cast into the fire, not to be purged, but vtterly wasted. There be yet other that kepe their foundation faste, and worke there vpon both golde and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but yet abased and somewhat defiled by the mixture of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infirmities not sufficiently redressed in this life: these must of necessity by Gods ordinaunce, suffer the Purgation by fire: that their workes purified and amended by the sentence of his iuste iudgement, may at length by mercy and grace bring them to their desired ende.</p>
                  <p>Now the perfect estate, which, hauing this groundewarcke, and building therevpon nothing for the most part, but the tried fine workes of heauenly doctrine and perfect charity, can not feare the fire, as in whome it shall finde no matter of waste. For if any drosse of seculare desires or worldly weakenesse, was in their frailty contracted, their fructefull penaunce in their life, washed that away by the force of Christes bloude, before the daye of our Lorde greate and fearefull, came vpon them:<note place="margin">

                  <p>These therefore thus guarded by Gods grace, in whome onely they chalenge this Priuilege, can not feele any daunger, their workes (as <hi>S.

For if such do passe the firie sworde, before they entre into the ioyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, yet they shall euen there be so shadowed, that to them it can neither be any whit molestious, nor one moments staye from the reward of their pure golden workes, which by fire can not perish. For of such, we muste beleue with Gods Church, that they go straight to heauen vpon their departure, with out stay or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in the next life. Although Christ onely, of his owne force, being not subiecte to any spotte of sinne, did passe this fire: and entre into heauen, the eternall gates opening them selues vnto him as to the king of glory.

Though by nature, that fire or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prepared for the amendment and punishing of sinne or the drosse thereof, might of force and right take holde there, where corruption of sinne by any meanes hath bene, that is not wholy purified before. Therefore the soule of our Sauiour, being altogether vnspotted, coulde not be subiect to any sufferance in the worlde to come, by any ordinaunce prepared for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sinne: that fire hauing no further graunt by creation
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2890:128"/>
and naturall property, but to waste there where sinne is founde to haue bene. Vpon other it woulde worke till all corruption were consumed, if mercy did not preuent both in purifying those sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular elect vessels, and in repressing the nature of the flame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, that it practise not iustice, where God hath abundantly shewed grace and mercy before.</p>
                  <p>Albeit I do not say that the firie sworde is in the passage of euery soule towardes heauen, for that is Gods secret: and I will with <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> in the same place say: <hi>Quod legi praesumo,</hi>

               <p n="1">1 HEre according to <hi>M. Allens</hi> orderly proceding, is alleged for purgatory a place out of <hi>S.

The meaning of Christ is playne, that he

shall neuer come out no more, then that wicked seruaunt, which was cast in pryson vntill he shoulde pay the whole debt which was ten thousand talents. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.

                  </gap>e we were told, that purgatory serueth but for veniall sinnes, or else for such mortall sinnes as by forgeuenes in this life obtayned, are made veniall trespasses. But here not onely vices and fleshly conuersation, but also contempt of all that preach Christ and repentaunce of our lothsome life past, &amp;c. are sayd to be the debt that must be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in purgatory to the vttermost farthing, then the which no vice is more mortall, nor farther from forgeuenes. For he that not only leadeth a lothsome life, but also contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all those meanes that Christ hath wrought to reduce him to the perfecton of a Christian godly life (I vse his owne wordes) how can he haue remission of his sinnes in this life, and yet <hi>M. Allen</hi> dare promise him, that the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of bandes in the prison of purgatory, shall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence his debt, and bring him from thence into the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed presence of Christ. <hi>M. Allen</hi> hath the most passing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of any that euer I heard, to build one thing in one leafe, and to ouerthrow it him selfe againe in the next. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse I can not abide that he should promise a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of that payment, which Christ sweareth shall be made vnto the vttermost farthing. For he that refuseth reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation or repentance in this life, must not looke for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don after this life. Therefore if <hi>M. Allen</hi> will needes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this pryson for purgatory, I will be so bold vppon Christes oth and earnest asseueration to affirme, that he which is so imprisoned shall neither looke for mercy nor satisfaction by other mens payment, but by his owne suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. But let vs see how he proueth, that this place is to be vnderstood of purgatory? First by likelihood that he should not haue sayd: he shall not escape vntill he hath payd the vttermost farthing, but rather, cast him into the darke dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of euerlasting damnation. <hi>M.

These wordes as you see, expressely proue our matter, open the meaning of the scripture whereon we nowe stoode, and do clearely set forth the ordre of Gods iustice in the next life. And they shall content the reader better, if he marke vpon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion this blessed man spake these wordes. There were many in the persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that time, that for feare or worldly respectes, denied their faith, and offered to idols: who afterward, the storme of tyrannie somewhat being caulmed, confessed their faulte, and did penaunce for the same, by <hi>S.

By whom, after due satisfaction made, they were admitted to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Christian company, &amp; receite of the holy Sacraments againe. But all pastours not of like mercy of seuerity in the case, some were suspended from the vse of the Sacraments longer, and othersome by more clemency with speede pardoned againe. Now <hi>S.

But <hi>S.

               <p n="3">3 The place of <hi>Cyprian</hi> hath more couller, but yet not so cleere for purgatory as <hi>M. Allen</hi> would seem to make it. For first it is plaine by the wordes both going before and following after, that he speaketh of adulterers that are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned in the Church, of whome some bishoppes that were <hi>Cyprian</hi> his predecessours had so harde a iudgement, that they did vtterly seclude them from reconciliation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them no place of repentaunce, but <hi>Cyprian</hi> was not of that vnreasonable seueritie, for his Church did receiue them, although they compted them not equall with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs or continent persons. For it is one thing to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by pardon, as adulterers are, but yet with some note of ignominie, an other to come to glory, as martyrs and continent persones doe. It is one thing by denying of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to adulterers in this life, to driue them to that prison, from whence they shall not come till they haue payed the vttermost farthing, an other thing to compt them vnreconciled, like them that immediatly receiue the reward of there faith and vertue. It is one thing for a man
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2890:133"/>
after he hath bene longe time vexed with sorowe for his sinnes, to be reformed as one that hath bene long purged in the fire, an other thing by suffering persecution to haue purged all his sinnes. Finally it is one thing to hange vpon the sentence of God in the daye of iudgement, as they seeme to do which being penitent for their heynous sinnes, yet are not absolued from them by the Church: An other thing to be assured of their crowne, which haue striued lawfully. And this I take to be the simple meaning of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> words, agreeing with the circumstaunce of the place. But if they were otherwise ment by him, surely they can not but with carte ropes be drawene to the Popes purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For those that stande by pardon he excludeth from glory, and those that are reformed by sorrow and purged by fire, he suspendeth vntill the last daye, and then maketh them vncertaine of the sentence also: which can not stande with the Papistes opinion of purgatory: no more then that which he writeth in his treatise against <hi>Demetrianus</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the ende. <hi>Quando isthinc excessum suerit, nullus iam locus poenitentiae est, nullus satisfactionis effectus. Hic vita aut amittitur aut tenetur &amp;c.</hi> When men are gone hence, there is no place of repentaunce, no effect of satisfaction: while we are here life is either lost or helde. And exhorting <hi>Demetrianus</hi> him selfe to repentaunce which had bene a wicked man and a persecutor of the Christians, he sayth to him: <hi>Tu sub ipso licet exitu, &amp; vitae temporalis occasu, pro dilictis roges Deum, qui vnus &amp; verus est, confessionem &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem agnitionis eius implores, venia confitenti datur, &amp; creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti indulgentia salutaris de diuina pietate conceditur, &amp; ad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitatem sub ipsa morte transitur.</hi> If thou although it but a litle before the ende and decay of this temporall life shall pray to God for thy sinnes, which is the onely true God, If thou desire confession and faith of his knowledge, pardon is giuen to him that confesseth, and holsome forgeuenes of the goodnes of God is graunted to him that beleueth, and euen from the howre of death he passeth into immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie.

And here a man may note a great peece of cunning in them that had the writing out of bookes, about those times when errours began to take strength, that not onely whole workes were falsly intitled to diuers good authours, but also patches inserted to their owne workes. And if any thing by them were once spoken, that sounded to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of those errors, that was thrust into diuers places of their writings, lest it should scarse be espied in one. And hereof it commeth, that such sayings in <hi>Augustine, Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> and other, as seeme to allow prayer for the dead, be so often repeated in their writings, and especially in homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that were taken of their mouthes, by Scribes and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. But who so euer was the father of this sentence as he speaketh friendely for the paynes of purgatory, so he sheweth him self an vtter enemy to the release of the same. So doth that <hi>Augustine</hi> which addeth his exhortation to these wordes by him repeated. But the other <hi>Augustine,</hi> which writeth vpon the 103.

The Church you say can not erre, and that company is the Church, which hath the Pope for their head, if therefore it can be proued, that the Pope and all they that take his part, haue erred, it is sufficiently shewed, that the Church may erre. <hi>S.

them selues, that not onely by diuerse men, but of one man they might well all be geuen. And being all in them selfe very true, the holy Church so liketh and alloweth them eche one, that yet by the common iudgement of all learned men, that meaning for Purgatory paines, she approueth as the most agreeable sense to the texte, and whole circumstance of the letter. But as soone as <hi>Origen</hi> went about to proue by the same scripture, that all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men shoulde at length be saued after due purgation by fire: then this pillar of trueth seeing an open falsehood gathered by the scripture of Gods worde, coulde susteine no longer. She set vp against this errour her pastors, the graue fathers of our faith. who ceased not, as occasion serued, to geue men warning of the deceite intended: not onely still mainteining the doctrine of Purgatory. but also expressely condemning all the reprehenders thereof, as hereafter it shall be better declared: and so misliking no sense that in it selfe was true, the meaning of Purgatory yet, hath bene of all the learned counted so certaine, that in geuing any other likely exposition, that was euer added with all, as most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to the will and wordes of the writers.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth franckely: that there hath bene no text of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by him alleaged to proue it, but it may haue an other meaninge, and is sometime other wise construed of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers them selues. I will aske no more to proue that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory hath no grounde in the worde of God, which is not an ambiguous oracle, that may be drawen euery way like a leaden rule, &amp; hath but one true sence or meaning, which is the right meaning of the holy Ghost. For although di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse men may geue diuerse interpretations of some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and harde place, which all conteine no impiety or falshode, yet the spirite of God meaneth but one thing, and not what euery mans wit and iudgement will take it to be. True it is that so longe as the proportion of faith is kept, the Church beareth with them that geue wronge interpretations, but the spirite of God which is in his Church, alloweth not wronge interpretations for right. And where as <hi>M. Allen</hi> alloweth all the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that the fathers haue made of the text by him alleaged, as true,

so long as they affirmed no error, he may by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son affirme, that contradictories are true, as in that saying of him that shall not come out vntill he haue payed the vttermost farthing: some haue expounded, that he shalbe alwayes punished, some that he shall not be alwayes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. One sayth he shal neuer be released, an other saith, he shall be released at length, how is it possible that both these interpretations can be true? and yet both these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations are founde in some writers. But his suerest shifte is, that the doctrine of purgatory, was a knowen trueth in all ages. But this is the whole matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie. For how can it be taken for a knowen trueth in all ages, which hath none so suer grounde in any text of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be wrested for it, but the same text may haue an other, and that a true interpretation. But of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of that error, we shall haue better occasion hereafter to discusse in the second booke, where this matter is of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose intreated of. In the meane time, we wil take that which is here graunted so liberaly, that there is no text of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alleaged for purgatory, but it may be otherwise truely interpreted, and not of purgatory, and that the fathers haue so done by <hi>M.

For if paine for sinne, were iniurious to Christes death, then, the holy prophet Dauid that liued long in greuous penaunce, were iniurious to his Lordes death: then the Church were iniurious to her owne spouse his death, that chargeth all offenders with penaunce: then God him selfe were iniurious to his owne sonnes death, that sharply punisheth sinne forgeuen: then Christ him selfe were iniurious to his owne death, that both by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and holy preaching, did euer commend sharpe penaunce and paine.</p>

For Christ hath payed the price of their sinnes, that repente and beleue in him, that follow his steppes, that

               <p n="2">2 Here we are taught what the difference is betwene the paynes of hell and purgatory. This difference is not in quality nor quantity, but in respect of continuance, and of the persons. The one is eternall, the other temporall, they that are in one, are desperate and impatient, the other in hope and patience without sinne or daunger of sinning. Surely if those tales were true, that are told of them that are in purgatory, there appeared in some but smal patience. One that was promised by an Angell that he should tarry but 3. dayes in purgatory, after he had bene there but one day, told the Angell to his face, that he was no Angell but a deceiuer, affirming that he had bene there many yeares. A monke that dyed without absolution in the absence of the Abbot, after his death was absolued, and enioyned for penance to tarry in purgatory vntill his body were buried, whereat he cryed so horribly, that his voyce was heard all ouer the abbey, saying, O vnmercifull man, hast thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded me to tarry so long in purgatory? A Bishop suspe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a priest for saying euery day masse of <hi>requiem,</hi> but as the same Prelate went ouer a churchyard, the dead arose e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man with such tooles as they occupied in their life, threatning him, that he should dye for it, he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them their soule priest. Againe one that promised his brother to say masse for him immediatly after his death, made hast to performe his promise, as soone as the breath
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2890:149"/>
was out of his hody: but when masse was done his brother appeared to him saying, O vnfaithfull brother, thou hast well deserued the curse of God for me, thou hast let me lye in torments these 20 yeares, and neither thou nor any of my brethren would vouchsafe to say one masse for me. If these and such like narrations, of which the popish homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and other writings are crammed full, were true reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there were small patience, mekenes, or loue, in some of the purgatory penitentionaries. Yet <hi>M. Allen</hi> sayth: <hi>these are the inferior partes, which boweth their knee and reuerenceth the name of Iesus, as the Apostle sayth</hi> Philip. 2. <hi>For those that be in the deepe hell, can not prayse nor confesse his blessed name as the Prophet sayth:</hi> Although that which <hi>Dauid</hi> sayth, be true of the damned spirites, yet he speaketh generally of all them that are deade, which can not prayse God in his Church as they doe that are aliue. But <hi>S. Paule</hi> to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. speaketh not of any willing obedience, or ioyfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of them that be in hell, but of that which is due to the maiestye of Christ, and enforced euen from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. For if none should bow to Christ but they that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him willingly, and praise his holy name cherefully, this text should not be verified of so many 1000. Turkes, Iewes and Infidels, that now blaspheme his holy name, but in the day of iudgement, vnto which time the perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of this prophecy is referred, they with all the deuills in hell, shal be brought on their knees and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Iesus is the Lord to the glory of God and their eternal confusion. And euen now already <hi>S. Iames</hi> teacheth that the deuils doe tremble. But if onely the soules in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory were ment by them that are vnder the earth, at the last day when Christ shall haue his chiefe glory, and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory as the Papistes confesse, shall be abolished, then there should be none in the infernall partes, that should bow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iesus and acknowledge his glorious maiestie according to the prophecy of <hi>Esay</hi> which <hi>S. Paule</hi> expoundeth of the last iudgement. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. And therefore although <hi>M. Allens</hi> affirmation of godly men to haue bene in the lower partes from the beginning of the world vnto the end of the same,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2890:150"/>
were true, as it is most false, yet it would not aunswere the verity of the prophecy, when at that time there shoulde be none, in which time the prophecy should chiefly be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but of what forehead, or mouth doth this procede? that he affirmeth that <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome may appeare by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to haue bene in the lower roomes, though separate from hell His reason seemeth to be, because all places of punishment after this life be in Scripture called <hi>Inferna,</hi> that is, hell or the lowest places.

bene saide, and whereon it standeth. And if God him selfe hath in all ages chastised his best beloued people and dearest children, both here and in the next life, if the Church hath practised dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, by his authority, vpon all obedient persons, if all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous haue charged them selues with paine, if all learned fathers haue both preached and done penaunce, for the auoiding of paines hereafter prepared, if the worde of God expressely make for this, if all learned men with out exception beleued it and feared it, if it agree with good reason, if it setforth Gods iustice, if it duely aunswere to the hatered of sinne, if it raise the feare of God in mans hearte, if it be the bane of prowde presumption, if it be the mother of meekenesse, of obedience, of deuotion, and of all good Christian condicions, let it for Gods loue, I pray thee once againe, take place in thy harte, and driue out that rest and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinne, which these delicate doctors, for thy present plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, vnder the colour of some honest name, haue deceitfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thee vnto.</p>

First if God haue punished his dearest children, not onely in this life, but also after this life, then let purgatory haue place againe: we are content, but vntill it may be proued out of the worde of God, that he hath punished his children after this life, we are not bounde by this argument. Secondly if the discipline of the Church, the exercise of the godly, the doctrine of all learned fathers that haue preached or done penaunce, hath bene for the auoiding of purgatory, then receiue purgatory againe. But if the ende of godly discipline, be either to heale the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by repentaunce in this life, or to separat the vncura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from infecting the sounde, if the fructes of repentau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and good workes of the godly are to be referred, to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying of their repentaunce, and their faith, and to the glorifying of God, if the doctrine of all the godly, that haue preached and done penaunce according to the worde of God, haue bene to the same endes, we may not yet geue
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2890:151"/>
place to admit purgatory. Thirdly if the word of God make expressely for purgatory, we would not for our liues deny it, nor doubt of it, but if the word of God doe neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely nor by any probable collection allow, but manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly condemne it, as blasphemous against the passion of Christ: then must we still not onely exclude it from our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, but also abhorre it from our heart. Forthly if all lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men without exception, beleued and feared purgatory, we will also beleue it and feare it, but vntill that may be proued, or that any godly learned euer knew of it for 200. yeares after Christ, we must craue pardon of <hi>M. Allen</hi> at the least wise to suspend our iudgement. Fifthly if it agree with good reason, which agreeth with the word of God, it were reason we should receiue it, but we acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt no reason good that is not consonant to the truth, and therefore if it can not be wonne by Scripture, we wil not yeld for any reason.

                  </gap>ly if it set forth the iustice of God to aunswere the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of sinne as God hath appoynted, we refuse it not, but if it be blasphemous both against the righteousnes of God and satisfaction for our sinnes aunswered in the sufferings of Christ, and against his vnspeakeable mercies, in proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such a wonderful meane of so perfect redemption, we defie it and the maintainers of it. Seuenthly, if it rayse the feare of God in mans heart, such as God alloweth, we must needes accept it, but if it rayse none but a slauish and that a vayne feare of torment, and diminisheth the loue of Gods goodnes and mercy, &amp; excludeth the peace of conscience, there is no remedy but we must still reiect it. If it be the bane of proud presumption, we haue cause to thinke well of it: but if it be the prouocation of deuilish presumption, to ascribe more to our merits then to the mercy of God, we acknowledge that it procedeth from the prince of pride and presumption against God. If it were the mother of meekenes, obedience, deuotion and of all Christian condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we were to blame if we would not entertaine it. But if it be the father of fables and false worship of God, the instrument of infidelitie, and sleepe of securitie, which are sworne enemies of all Christian religion, we leaue it to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes,

               <p>THE SECOND BOOKE</p>

And now you will mollyfie the hardnesse of that handling, with the sory comforte of your vnchristian cause. Wherin you haue more regarde to the heating of your owne harthe, then to the cooling of the selye soules, to kindle a good fire in your owne kitchen, then to quench the flambes of purgatory. But as I haue noted before, that you haue hetherto kept this order for the most parte, to plante one thinge in one chapter, and then to pull it vp by the rootes in the next, so you haue not forgotten your selfe in the diuision of your bookes. But that the latter shoulde be a sufficient confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former, or else the former a manifest excluding of the latter. For if the iustice of God doth so necessarily require a punishment for sinnes remitted, that the same coulde not be satisfied, no not by that only sacrifice, which the sonne of God offered once for all, on the aulter of the crosse: it is a colde comforte that a carefull conscience can receiue, that the same shoulde be done by his merites, or your Masses, which was not done by the bloude of Christ
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2890:154"/>
Yet now you will talke how the fiery sword maye be turned away, surely if the fiery and shaking sworde that was set to exclude man from Paradise, was not taken away by the death of Christ, when he opened Paradise, yea the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen whereof Paradise was but a sacrament, vnto all beleuers, I meruaill how either the penitent these had passage into Paradise, or what engins you Papistes haue to turne it awaye, which he had not. The wordes of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascene</hi> if they were not applied (as you saye they are) to purgatory paines and remedies of the same, were true of Gods iustice and his mercy, but as his age is to young, so his authoritie is to light, to controll the trueth of the worde of God, or the practise of the first &amp; purest Church, which knew no purgatory, nor prayers for the deade. <hi>But if our sinnes forgeuen were neuer so greuous, &amp;c.</hi> what mad man woulde euer write thus? Euen such a one as might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to speake thus: if blacke were neuer so blacke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were cleane taken away and perfect white placed in the steede, yet when white is white, it is white. But <hi>M. Allen</hi> wil not allowe that the coullor of our sinnes is cleane taken away and a contrary coullor of righteousnesse set vppon vs, but that sinnes forgeuen, be but halfe forgeuen, the gilte taken awaye, the punishment due for the gilte, still remayning. And this one halfe of forgeuenesse, is but graunted in wordes, and denied in deede. For if the gilte of our sinnes be cleane taken away from vs, and layed vpon the person of Christ, and the righteousnesse of Christ is communicated vnto vs, what is there lefte in vs that God of his goodnesse can hate or of his iustice can punish? So it is but for a fashion, that the papistes graunt any parte of our sinnes forgeuen, when they will haue vs make sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for them our selues. But where as <hi>M. Allen</hi> is out of measure prodigall in promising releiffe and release of purgatory paines to them whose sinnes were neuer so gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, their vicious life wasted in idle wealth, the space of penaunce and opportunity of working neglected in time, preuented by sodaine death &amp;c: rehersing so many meanes of mitigation, as sometime the bloude of Christ, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidew

For it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all the olde writers, that doe allowe any of these thinges, to profit men after their death, and concluded by the <hi>Maister</hi> of the Sentence, and aduouched by <hi>Allen</hi> him selfe afterwarde chapt. 7. that no man can receiue benefit after his departure, by any worke or will of the liuing, but he that in his life deserued the same, neither shal any thing worke vpon him more or lesse, but according to his owne deseruing in this life.

And this is the difference betwene heresie and truth, when they both apeale to the authorities of the Scripture. Truth as she hath her foundation in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in them is learned, so hath she perpetuall confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the same, and nothing contrary vnto her. But heresie as she is inuented in mans head, so she seeketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in the reason and authoritie of man, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue not full credit with them that professe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without the authoritie of Gods word, at length whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is fully shaped, in the shop of mans brayne, then it is brought to the Scripture, to see if it can finde any colour, by any phrase of wordes wrested from the meaning, or by any vayne collection, that hath no force of necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, being content to haue but onely a colde claime vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the authoritie of Scripture, although it haue the whole scope and purpose of the holy Ghost, yea often times also manifest wordes against it, which difference as it may be found in all heresies, so in none more notably, then in this errour of purgatory. Consider what textes of holy Scripture are alleged for it, and you shall see they can not bring one, out of which any necessary argument may be framed to proue their cause, or which hath not by learned interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the olde time bene otherwise expounded then of their cause. As in the text here alleged out of <hi>S. Matt. cap.</hi> 12. who so euer shall speake blasphemy against the holy ghost, it shall not be forgiuen him, neither in this world nor in the world to come. If the sense were not plaine of it selfe, that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:2890:158"/>
he which so sinneth shall not obtayne forgeuenes in this life, nor be absolued in the last iudgement: yet the other Euangelistes doe plainly expound the meaning. <hi>S. Luke</hi> sayth simply, he shal not be forgiuen. <hi>S. Marke</hi> saith he hath no remission for euer, but is guilty of euerlasting iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Neuertheles behold what a wrangling <hi>M. Allen</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth about the interpretation of these wordes. But I will offer him fayre play, he is an auncient maister of art, &amp; since he writ this booke, he hath added tenne yeares to his study of diuinitie, in which space he might haue bene a doctour of the same faculty, let him with all the diuinitie that euer he studied, or with all the artes that euer he professed, make a true syllogisme in forme and matter, out of this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to proue that God forgiueth sinnes after this life, which are not remitted in this life, and I will confesse the doctrine of purgatory with him, which otherwise I would not doe to winne all the patrimony of <hi>S. Peter</hi> that the Pope clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in Italy: but vntill such tyme as we may obtayne a good argument, let vs consider such as we haue. <hi>He signifieth</hi> (sayth <hi>M. Allen) that a man in some case, might perhaps not speede of a pardon in this life, &amp; yet may obtayne it in the next:</hi> when the matter goeth by perhaps, it is good to beware of after claps, why <hi>M. Allen,</hi> what sinnes are those of which a man may perhaps not speede of a pardon in this life, and yet obtayne it after this life? If they be truely repented in this life, we haue a warrant of Gods owne mouth without, your perhaps, that in the same hower they shall be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 33. But if they be not repented, where is your warrant that euer they shall be remitted. But I aske a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, what sinnes are those that perhapps maye misse of a pardon in this life, and obteine it after this life? by all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood they must be some great sinnes, that perhapps may not speede of a pardon here, and yet finde it afterwarde. There is no man would thinke otherwise, by these wordes, nor by the wordes of Christ, if he vnderstood them so, that some sinnes might be forgeuen after this life, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all commeth to all. The <hi>Maister</hi> of the Sentence and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> before him, and <hi>M. Allen</hi> him selfe woulde alowe no
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2890:158"/>
sinnes to be forgeuen after this life, but very small and light offences. How be it it is plaine, that these wordes <hi>(neither in the worlde to come)</hi> are added by waye of ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: for it is the purpose of our Sauiour Christ, to set forth to the vttermost, the heynousnesse of blasphemy against the holy Ghost, so that if he had ment that any sinnes might be remitted after this life, that were not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned after this life, he shoulde haue ment the greater and not the lesser, for lesse sinnes be soner pardoned and the pardon of greater more hardely obteined. But marke the equitie of <hi>M. Allen,</hi> the horrible blasphemer for all the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of Christes wordes, by <hi>M. Allens</hi> iudgement is but in a manner discharged of hope of remission, as though he were not simply and altogether excluded. And the light offender is turned ouer to purgatory, for his remission: yet <hi>M. Allen</hi> will stand vpon the forme &amp; phrase of words, not knowing, <hi>that this worlde</hi> is taken for all the time that is vnto the ende thereof, <hi>and the worlde to come,</hi> not for the state or time of them that are departed vnto the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but for the time of eternitye after the ende of this worlde, or els the wordes of Christ in <hi>Matthew</hi> should not be equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualent with the wordes in <hi>Marke, he shalbe guilty of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting iudgement or condemnation,</hi> which the olde interpretor calleth eternall offence. The like forme or phrase of words is vsed by <hi>S.

And so he seemeth to say in the 13. chapter of the same booke. <hi>Non autem omnes veniunt in sempiternas poenas, quae post illud iudiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his sunt futurae, qui post mortem sustinent temporales, nam quibusdam quod in isto non remittitur, remitti in futuro saeculo, id est ne futuri saeculi aeterno supplicio puniantur iam ante dixi.</hi> All they come not into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting paynes which after that iudgement shall be to them, that after death suffer temporall paynes, for I haue sayd already, that vnto some, that which is not remitted in this world, is remitted in the world to come, that is, that they should not be punished in the world to come.

But in the place by you alleged, if the words be truly translated according to the discourse of that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he affirmeth, that after the resurrection &amp; those paynes which the spirites of the dead doe suffer, there shal be some vpon whom mercy shall be bestowed, so that they shall not be cast into eternall fire, &amp;c.

But you haue merites of men, to helpe the merites of Christ. O blasphemy! they that can not be iustified by their owne merites, by the vertue of them, shall healpe to iustifie other.

But because <hi>M. Allen</hi> bringeth in the communion of saintes. I must shew where in the same consisteth. The communion of saintes is considered either of the whole body of the church, or else of the Church militant here on earth. The communion of the whole body, is the participation of life and all other offices of life, that euery member and the whole body hath of the heade, as <hi>S. Paule</hi> teacheth plainely <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. The communion of saintes here on earth, as it is a pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te of the whole communion, so the whole Vertue commeth also from the heade, and the members haue but the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration thereof, according to the measure and office of euery one. So that when we speake of the vniuersall Church, we beleue that all the elect of God are one my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall body, that so liueth by Christ, that it is not possible for any one member thereof to perish: when we speake of the communication of the faythfull heare on earth, we meane the dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sation of the grace and gifts of God, which as euery one hath receiued of God, so of charity he is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to imploye the same, to the profit of his fellowe members here on earth: what place is here to merit for them that are deade, when one can not merit for an other that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, no not for him selfe, but euery man hath his worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ: this is the doctrine of the scripture: the other participation of merittes is a mere deuise of men, hauing no foundation in the worde of God, so that <hi>M. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> him selfe can not vouch so much as one text of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to warranty, where in he can haue any coullor for
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:2890:163"/>
such communion of merites. For that which <hi>S. Paule</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. is manifestly vnderstood of the mutuall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of loue, whereby one member hath compassion with an other, &amp; by no meanes teacheth either the estate of the deade, or the merittes of the liuing. Of like credit it is, that he so constantly affirmeth that the Saintes in heauen pray for their fellowes beneth, and that they belowe pray for the helpe of the Saintes aboue: moreouer that Christ our heade by whose bloude the society standeth, will haue no worke nor waye of saluation that is not common to the whole body in generall, and particularly profitable to supply the neede of any parte thereof. Here you see by a plaine distribution that <hi>M. Allen</hi> will haue other workes and wayes of saluation, beside the bloude of Christ. These things being onely affirmed and not proued by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scriptures, although I might confute at large by the same, yet it shall suffice to aunswere with that auncient father: <hi>That which hath no authority in the Scriptures, is as easily denied as it is affirmed.</hi> But it is a worlde to see what a compasse you fetch, to bringe in the Masse, for one of the speciall meanes. It was wont to be a sacrifice propitiatory both for the quicke and the deade, nowe you haue nicer termes for it. Now: <hi>it is the sacrifice of the Church.</hi> By whome instituted I pray you? <hi>which by the will of the author:</hi> if you make God the author, where haue you one sillable in the Scripture to declare his will? but that which followeth passeth: <hi>By the likenesse of the exemplar (as in deede being in an other manner the very selfe same.)</hi> What is this that I heare? doth the Masse aueyle because it is like the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar? if you meane the sacrifice of Christ his passion to be the examplar, the masse is as like it as an apple is like an oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, for all the apish pageantes that be played in it. We read in the Scriptures, that all the sacrifices of the olde lawe, with the tabernacle, were made conformable to the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar and paterne that was shewed vnto <hi>Moses</hi> which was Christ <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. But that there shoulde be any more shadowes, or resemblaunces, when the bodye and substance it selfe is come, it is contrary to the whole scope
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:2890:163"/>
of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrues. M. Allen</hi> hath a shift for that, saying it is the very selfe same in an other maner. But he is so deepe in diuinity, that he forgetteth his first principles of logike. For euery boye in Oxford can tell him, that those things which be like, can not be the same. If therefore the Masse be like the sacrifice of Christ, then is it not the sacrifice of Christ it selfe. Againe the exemplar and the example be proper relatiues, therfore if the sacrifice of Christ be the exemplar whereof the Masse is the example, the Masse can not be the sacrifice of Christ. Neither will it helpe, that he sayth, <hi>It is the selfe same in an other maner,</hi> so long as the same respect remaineth. But let him make of his Masse what he can, the Church of God instructed by Gods worde receiueth no more sacrifices propitiatory, but onely the sacrifice of Christ his death, which was offered by no other, but by him selfe, and that once for all. <hi>Seeing that by one oblation he hath made perfect for euer, those that are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified:</hi> Hebr. 10.</p>

                              <hi>sub oculis videntes quae facta sunt pro peccatis eorum qui postrati sunt. Et facta collatione, duodecim millia drachmas argenti misit Ierosolymam of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferri pro peccatis mortuorum sacrificium, bene &amp; religiose de resurrectione cogitans: (nisi enim eos qui ceciderant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrecturos speraret, superfluum videretur &amp; vanum orare pro mortuis) &amp; quia considerabat quod hi qui cum pietate dormitionem acceperant, optimam haberent repositam gratiam. Sancta ergo &amp; salubris est cogitatio, pro defunctis exorare, vt a peccatis soluantur.</hi> The valiaunt man <hi>Iudas,</hi> exhorted the people to kepe them selues from sinne, hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, what was fallen for the offensies of them that were slaine. And a common gathering being made, he sent xij thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand peces of siluer to Ierusalem, to offer for the sinnes of those that were departed, a Sacrifice: being well and religiously min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, concerning the resurrection: for except he had suerly tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, that such as were slaine shoulde arise againe, it might haue bene counted vaine and superfluous to praye for the deade. But because he did well consider, that such as in piety receiued their sleepe, had grace and fauour laide vp for them, therefore it is a holy and proffitable meaning to praye for the deade, that they may be assoyled of their sinnes. So farre the Author of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie speaketh: setting forth most euidently, the notable piety of <hi>Iudas</hi> in exhorting them to releue the departed, the like liberall almes of the people, the prayers there in the campe, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice at Ierusalem celebrated for the same purpose. In all which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:2890:166"/>
doing, the scripture much prayseth that worthy zele of <hi>Iudas,</hi> as a thing both profitable to the departed towardes the remission of their offensies, and no lesse agreeing to that his especiall hope of the resurrection to come: counting it a foly to pray for them, of whose resurrection we are not assured. VVherby, I can not tell whether a man may well gether, that such as deny the fellowship of the liue with the deade, or condemne prayers made for them, steadfastly beleue not the resurrection.<note place="margin">

Allen</hi> shall misse of his purpose Sacrifice, almes, prayers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by scripture, to be meanes to helpe the soules in purgatory. And the scripture is written. 2. <hi>Machab.</hi> 12. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thesauro carbones:</hi> we haue founde coles in the steed of treasure. Is this all the scripture we are like to haue? this hath bene aunswered of olde to be no holy nor canonicall scripture, and that by many reasons. First because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth matter contrary to the vndoubted worde of God. I omit this matter in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersy in the 14. chap. the author of the booke commendeth one <hi>Razis</hi> for killing him selfe, which is contrary to the word of God. Wherefore <hi>M. Allen</hi> by authoritie of this booke, &amp; the example of a good man <hi>Razis</hi> may as well conclude that it is lawfull for men to kill them selues, as by the example of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that men may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:2890:167"/>
sacrifice for the dead. Secondly the author of this booke declareth, that he abridgeth the fiue bookes of <hi>Iason</hi> the <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renian,</hi> into this one, which is a manifest argument, that he was not the instrument of the holy Ghost. For the holy Ghost maketh no abridgements of others mens writings. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the purpose of the author proueth that he was not directed by Gods spirite, for he confesseth that he tooke this matter in hande, that men might haue pleasure in it, which could not away with the tedious long stories of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> But the spirite of God serueth not such vayne delight of men. Moreouer, he sheweth what labour and sweate it was to him, to make this abridgement, and to be short, he maketh a very prophane preface, ambitiously commending his trauell and shewing the difference betwene a story at large, and an abridgment: all which thinges sauour no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that spirite, by which the holy Scriptures of God were written, which as <hi>S. Peter</hi> sheweth, <hi>came not by priuate mens will and ordinance, but the holy men of God spake as they were inspired by the holy Ghost.</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. where as all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face sheweth nothing, but a priuate motion &amp; an humane purpose. And yet the man is to be commended for this, that he doth not boast of any more reuelation then he had, but in the end of this booke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesseth his infirmity &amp; desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is as farre from the maiesty of gods spirit, as it is agreeable to the weakenes of our deceiuable nature, which are apt to deceiue and be deceiued. <hi>If I haue wel done</hi> (sayth he) <hi>and as the story required, it is the thing I desired: but if I haue spoken slenderly and barely, it is that I could. For as it is hurtfull to drinke wine alone, and then agayne water, and as wine tempered with water is pleasant and delighteth the tast, so the setting out of the matter delighteth the eares of them that readeth the story, &amp;c.</hi> Who is so voyd of the spirite of God, that can not see plainly that this man had neither the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to write that which shoulde instruct, much lesse that should bind the consciences of men, neither the gift so to write as in writing he could not erre? But now to come to the text it selfe, first the greeke copy in this place is so man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and corrupted that no good sense can be gathered of

the wordes, by which it appeareth, that the deuils limbes haue bene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umbling with this booke, as they haue bene with the olde doctors in places where mention is of prayer for the deade. Secondly seeing this facte of <hi>Iudas,</hi> hath no commaundement in the law, in which not so much as one pinne of the tabernacle, was omitted, lest any thing might be left to the will of man, to deuise in the worship of God, it is so farre of, that it is to be drawne into example, that we may be bold to condemne it for sinne, &amp; disobedience, <hi>you shall not doe</hi> (sayth the Lord) <hi>what seemeth good in your owne eyes, but that which I commaund you, that onely shall you doe, without adding any thinge to it or taking away any thing from it.</hi> But <hi>M. Allen</hi> thinketh he hath a sure post to leane vnto, because <hi>Iudas Machabaeus</hi> did by this fast testifie, his hope of the resurrection, as <hi>Iasons</hi> abridger sayth, and also that prayers for the deade, may be an argument to proue the faith that men haue of the resurrection. It is not vnlike that this reason preuayled much with the auncient fathers, as appeareth by their writings, for commonly it hath the best colour of any reason that they bring to allow prayers for the dead. But if it be weighed with good iudgement, it is of no force to proue, that prayers for the dead, are lawful. For as truth may be proued alwayes with true principles, so often tymes it may be concluded out of false affirmations. As for example, Idolatrie proueth that there is a God, but Idolatry is not therefore the true worship of God. Of the heresie of the Pharisies that helde <hi>Pythagoras</hi> opinion, of the passing of one soule into diuers bodies, may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the immortalitie of the soule, but this doth not iustifie that errour of the Pharisies: by the heresy of <hi>Origines</hi> which taught that all men should be saued at length, not onely the immortalitie of the soule and the resurrection, but also the infinite mercy of God may be concluded, which all are true articles, yet was not the heresie of <hi>Origine</hi> true for all this, vnlesse <hi>M. Allen</hi> hath forgotten that olde sophisme which children can solute: who so euer sayth you are an asse, sayth you are a lyuing creature: but he that sayth you are a liuing creature sayth true: therefore who so euer sayth you are
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:2890:168"/>
an asse sayth true. And such for all the worlde is <hi>M. Allens</hi> reason: who so confesseth prayers for the deade confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that the deade doe liue and shall rise againe: but he that confesseth that the dead doe liue and shall rise againe doth not erre: therefore he that confesseth prayers for the deade doth not erre.</p>

so many worldes together hath bene worthy the reading in the Church of Christ, shoulde nowe receiue such wrong at our handes, because it plainely resisteth these fellowes, that exalt mans me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites (aboue Gods grace.) And againe, this booke is of more authority then all the expositours in the worlde: for the noble writers hard by the Apostles time, did much preferre this booke before them selues, who alleaging the testimony of that scripture, doubted not, but they vsed thereby, the witnesse of Gods holy word. Euen so must we tell our maisters, that it were plaine wrong, to discredit the history of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> which hath bene in our Bible euer sith Christes time for holy Scripture, because it hath an euident testimonie against their false belefe, concerning the state of the soules departed: which booke, is not onely better to be beleued then all <hi>Caluins</hi> false gloses, but of more authority then all holy expositors. Out of which booke, both <hi>S. Augustine</hi> &amp; others many, haue vsed proofe of their matters, as of the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Sacred and holy scripture.</p>

But he that admitteth for scripture, that which is not proceded from the spirite of God, and thereby will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch for trueth, that which is contrary to the vndoubted worde of God, is no lesse heretike then he, for it is all one sinne, to adde to the worde of God and to take from it. But <hi>M.

But this I knowe, that in his Preface vpon the booke of kinges he doth not onely omit it in rehersall of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall bookes, but also accompteth it plainely among the Apocryphall. Next he alleageth the canons of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. Wise canons I promise you: as truely made by the Apostles, as the double canons that lie on the tower hyll of London. In which are rehersed 3. bookes of <hi>Machabees</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:2890:170"/>
two Epistles of Clemens for canonicall scripture, but the Apocalypse of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> hath no place at all, by which it may appeare, what Apostles they were, that made that canckred canon. Then followeth the prouinciall Councell of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> the third, which nameth the 2. bookes of the <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi> amonge the canonicall scriptures euen as it doth the 5. bookes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> whereas the Church alloweth but 3. namely the Prouerbes, the preacher, and the Canticles: and although you shoulde numbre to these, the booke of Wisdome, yet can you make but 4. in all that we know of. Againe, in what sence they did call those bookes canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, appereth by <hi>Augustine,</hi> that was one of that Councell, namely that they maye be reade, so it be with iudgement. Contra 2. Gaudentij epistolam lib. 2. cap. 23. Et hanc qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem scripturam quae appellatur Machabaeorum non habent Iudaei sicut legem &amp; Prophetas, &amp; Psalmos, quibus domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus testimonium perhibet tanquam testibus suis dicens: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portet impleri omnia quae scripta sunt in lege, &amp; prophetis, &amp; in psalmis de me. Sed recepta est ab ecclesia non inuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter, si sobriè legatur &amp; audiatur. <hi>And this scripture of the</hi> Machabees, <hi>the Iewes compte not as the lawe and the prophetes and the Psalmes, to whome our Lorde geueth testimony as to his witnesses saying, it behoued that all thinges should be fulfilled, that were written of me, in the lawe, and in the Prophetes, and in the Psalmes. But it is receiued of the Church not vnprofitably, if it be soberly reade and harde.</hi> Here you see that <hi>Augustine</hi> howsoeuer he alloweth those bookes, yet he alloweth them not in full authority, with the lawe, Prophetes and Psalmes, nor with out condition of sobriety in the reader or hearer. But <hi>Hieronym</hi> sayth plainely the Church receiueth them not as canonicall scriptures: in his preface vpon the booke of <hi>Prouerbes:</hi> Sicut ergo Iudith &amp; Tobiae, &amp; Machabaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum libros, legit quidem ecclesia, sed eos inter canonicas scripturas non recipit: Sic &amp; haec duo volumina legat ad aedificationem plaebis, non ad authoritatem ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum dogmatum confirmandam. <hi>Therefore euen as the Church readeth in deede the bookes of Iudith, Tobias, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees, but yet receiueth them not among the canonicall scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:2890:171"/>
so maye she reade these</hi> 2. <hi>bookes</hi> (videlicet Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus and the booke of Wisdome falsely intitled to Salomon) <hi>for the edification of the people, but not to confirme the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ecclesiasticall opinions.</hi> Thus if <hi>Augustine</hi> doe simply al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe these bookes, you haue <hi>Hieronym</hi> that doth simply refuse them. If <hi>Augustine</hi> saye the Church receiueth them for canonicall, <hi>Hieronym</hi> sayth the Church receiueth them not for canonicall. As for <hi>Damascene</hi> except you woulde stryue with numbre of witnesses I know not why you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage him, being one to whose iudgement as but a late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in comparison, you know we ascribe small credit. I might produce against him <hi>Athanasius</hi> or at leste wise one of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der time then <hi>Damascene</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> but that I haue alleaged already is sufficient to represse that vaine and vnskilfull insultation, that you vse in so many wastfull wordes against vs, for refusing the authority of him, that abridged <hi>Iason</hi> the Cyrenians bookes, for cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall scriptures.</p>

                  <p>But now you may see, that whiles these men thought to saue their credits, by miscrediting the Scripture, they haue wrought so wisely, that they haue lost their owne credits, both in this poynt, and in all other for euer.

But he that longeth to haue his splene or his gaule moued, let him reade these discourses following, if he list to laugh at foolish arguments let him come hether, if he wilbe angry with frowarde applications of the scripture here can he not wante occasion. And first he hopeth that all they that loue the trueth will fauor his cause, when they heare out of the scriptures, that sacrifice for the deade, was offered at Ierusalem by order of the lawe? By order of the lawe <hi>M. Allen?</hi> shew me one iote or title of the lawe to approue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the deade. <hi>Et eris mihi magnus Apollo, &amp; Phyllida solus habebis,</hi> and I will worshippe your wordes as an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and confesse that you onely haue the trueth. I know your aunswere: you haue no writing, but you haue good reasons, for so good a knight, so many priestes, so good a bishop, such an author woulde neuer haue allowed it, if it had not bene according to the lawe of God. Touching your authour we haue saide enough already, As for the good knight <hi>Iudas,</hi> was not so suer of falling, but <hi>Dauid</hi> a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2890:175"/>
better knight then he, transgressed the lawe of God, to carry the arke vpon a new chariotte, which shoulde haue bene borne vpon mens shoulders, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. wherein not onely <hi>Dauid,</hi> but so many Priestes, and Leuites, so good a bishop, and the whole generall councell of Israell did erre. Here was neither <hi>Zadocke,</hi> nor <hi>Abiather,</hi> nor <hi>Abinadab,</hi> nor <hi>Gad,</hi> nor <hi>Nathan</hi> or any other that made contradiction, vntill God him selfe shewed his displeasure by killing of <hi>Vzza</hi> But because <hi>M. Allen</hi> thinketh the bishop being so good a man, woulde neuer haue consented to it, if it had bene euill. I woulde aske of him, who was bishop or high priest then, that he was so good a bishop, and so worthy of his commendation. Suerly if he were a good man, he was much to blame to suffer any such thing to be done, in the temple of God, which was not appointed by the lawe of God. But if he were a wicked and an vngodly man, by <hi>M. Allens</hi> owne reason, it is not vnlike, but that he woulde for the gaine of 2000 drachmes of siluer, suffer such a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious newe vsage contrary to the lawe. Now because <hi>M. Allen</hi> sayeth he was so good a bishop, let him chose which it was of these 3. that satte on the seate of the high priest all the time that <hi>Iudas</hi> had any dignity amonge the people, namely <hi>Iason, Menclaus</hi> and <hi>Alcinus,</hi> let him take the beste of them (although it appeareth by the story that <hi>Menae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> the worst of them all three, was Byshop in that tyme) and he shall see, that no man euer (except he were willfully disposed to lye) would bestow such commendation vppon him as <hi>M. Allen</hi> doth, to call him so good a Bishop, and to defend the gouernment of so good a Bishop from suffering any superstitious vsage contrary to the law, when they were all three open transgressors forsakers of the law: And what the Priestes of that time were, let his owne author declare, 2. <hi>Mach.</hi> 4. <hi>The priestes were now no more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the aultar, but despised the temple, and regarded not the sacrifices, but made hast to be partakers of the wicked expenses at the play, after the casting of the stone.</hi> These were those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Priestes of those dayes, not vnlike your hedge Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes of popery. And although <hi>Iudas</hi> did afterward make a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2890:175"/>
peece of reformation, after the horrible prophaning of the temple, and the lawes through cruell persecution, yet these Priestes were not therby sodenly chaunged into god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men carefull for the sinceritie of Gods law: but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy like the reformed popish Priestes that we haue seene in our tyme, to doe what so euer the Prince hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; to be as ready againe to doe the contrary at an other Princes commaundement. In such a time, &amp; vnder so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a Priest, no maruell, if such corruption did enter. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the fact of <hi>Iudas</hi> fauoureth not the popish purgatory, where none but veniall and light sinnes are expiable, but those that were slayne, for whom the same offering was made, dyed in deadly sinne as appeareth by the story, they had vnder their coates Iewels, consecrated to Idolls, which was so heynous an offence that <hi>Iudas</hi> feared that they should haue bene all vtterly destroyed for their fault, and therefore it might seeme, that he caused the sacrifice to be offered not so much to pacifie God for them that were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as to purge them selues of that pollution and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, sauing that the author of the booke expoundeth that fact otherwise. And whereas <hi>M. Allen</hi> sayth, that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the dead is yet vsed of the Iewes. They that haue as good cause to know their custome as he, affirmeth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He citeth <hi>Antonius Margarita</hi> turned from a Iewe to a Papiste which auoucheth the same. The rabbins in their writings, when they speake of any that is dead, they onely blesse his memory, and in the booke of their common prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ceremonies printed in the hebrew tongue there is no such forme of prayer to be found for the deade. But if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them (as they doe in many ceremonies <hi>papizare</hi>) haue learned the superstition of the Papistes, it is not this alone that they haue contrary to the word of God. But lette vs come to the matter of this chapter, <hi>M. Allen asketh what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing doth all the mourning, fasting, and other ceremonies of burying meane, but a practise for the rest of their soules?</hi> I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere with distinction, because his question is with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: partly they meane, that those which did such thinges lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for the departure of so excellent men, partly they
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2890:176"/>
ment to shew their hope of their resurrection, mourning &amp; fasting were to expresse their sorrow, the other ceremonies were to declare that mens bodies should rise againe. As for almes I find not that it was vsed at burialls. But what meane you <hi>M. Allen</hi> (if you be not out of your wittes) to imagine prayer for the dead to be practised at those burialls? when in so many burialls as are rehearsed in the Scriptures, with all ceremonies vsed about them, neuer is there one word, nay not one sillable, to proue prayer for their soules. And yet as a man with a marble face, you are not ashamed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that rites, offices, diriges, obites, trentalls, &amp;c. were practised by them, for the reliefe of the soules in purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It may be that much of your paultry, by fond imitation was taken of such doings to counterfet the examples of the Patriarkes: (but once againe I say) there is no mention in al the Scripture of prayer for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he dead at any burial. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the authoritie of <hi>Ambrose</hi> helpeth you litle, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he commendeth <hi>Honorius</hi> for solemnising the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls of <hi>Theodosius</hi> by the space of 40. dayes, after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> yet he sayth not, that prayer for the deade was taken by the example of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> But see <hi>M. Allen</hi> (if you can see any thing) whether blind affection carieth you, that you can not vnderstand the playne latine of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or else will not translate it a right. <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh not of his fortieth dayes minde, but of the solemnitie of his funerall kept 40. dayes togither, as in the embalming of <hi>Iacobs</hi> body was by <hi>Ioseph.</hi> But to say the truth, how simple a reason this was, to take example of, for the time of solemnitie of fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, it is playne by that place which <hi>Ambrose</hi> allegeth, where it is sayd that 40. dayes were bestowed, by the Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Apothecaries in embalming the body of <hi>Iacob,</hi> to keepe it long from putrefaction. And how slenderly he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth them that kept 7. dayes funeralls, where if his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son were good by example of <hi>Iosephs</hi> Poticaries to keepe 40. dayes, theirs were better by example of <hi>Ioseph</hi> him selfe to keepe 7. dayes. These be the groundes of such superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as crept into the Church, first by emulation of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes, and after seeking for colourable confirmation in the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:2890:176"/>
examples of the Patriarkes. For auoyding of all which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences that haue risen and may rise, by ceremonies practised at burialls, the Church of Geneua very wisely &amp; godly, vseth no more ceremonies in burying their deade, then are conuenient for the reuerent laying vp of the corps which is ordayned to ryse agayne with glory. Whose still buriall is better then your yelling and howling, and their mumming (if you will needes so terme it) more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, then you masking.</p>

Now what other thing did <hi>Dauid</hi> here and his people, but that which <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> did afterwarde, for the like death of his souldiars? I trowe there was no fasting to be found ouer any maner a person, lyue or dead, for thy selue, or other, in the whole course of scripture, but it was to obteine mercy at Gods hande, towardes the partie for whome thou didest it. So did this same holy Prophet weepe, fast,<note place="margin">

                     </note> lye on the grounde, and change apparell, for his childe, which he begat of <hi>Vrias</hi> wife, when he lay at the point of death, stricken by Gods hande for the punishment of his fathers faulte. The which he did, as he protesteth him selfe, to turne the angry sentence of God if it might be, and recouer the childe againe. But as soone as the childe was gone, he brake of his longe fast, geuing his frendes to weete, that he tormented not him selfe so, of onely naturall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towardes the childe, or inordinate lous, as they thought, but to obteine his purpose by such bitter teares, and fasting, at Gods handes, for the childs recouery.</p>
                  <p>Fasting then ouer any man, and such solemne mourning, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but an effectuall asking of mercy, for whome so euer it
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2890:177"/>
be done. As more plainely it is yet declared, in the buriall of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathas</hi> before said,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1. Reg. 31.</hi>
                     </note> celebrated by the Galadites and Saules souldiars: VVhere, as the scripture sayth, after they had buried their bodies and bones, they fasted vij. dayes. <hi>Et ieiuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerunt septem diebus.</hi> For no other cause, but thereby effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to aske pardon of their offensies. There can I am sure be no reasonable occasion of their fasting alleaged of no man, but that which the honorable <hi>Bede</hi> testifieth for vs in these wordes. <hi>Recte &amp; ad literam pro mortuis vt ad requiem peruenire valeant septem diebus ieiunatur, quia post sex huius mundi aetates, in quibus in carne laboramus, septima est in illo sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo aetas requictionis animarum carne exutarum, in qua beatae tempus illud glorificum, quando resurgere merean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur expectant.</hi> Duely and according to the letter, they fasted (sayth he) for the departed, seuen dayes together, to obteine rest for them: because after the six ages of the worlde, in which we trauell in flesh, the seuenth age is looked for in that worlde, when the soules be loosed from their bodies, when the blessed and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py sort, shall continually be in expectation of the glorious time, by receiuing their bodies in the resurrection againe.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="2">2 As we haue had prayer for the dead, so now we shal haue fasting for the deade. In deede the wordes sounde more like such a matter then any thing that can be sayed of prayer for the deade. But the sence is euident, they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted not for them to redeme their soules, but they fasted, to declare their sorrow, because they were slaine with the sworde as it followeth in plaine wordes. And yet to make the matter more plaine, in the same Chapter followeth a large forme of lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation made by <hi>Dauid</hi> for them, where if euer he had vsed prayer for the deade, he woulde haue vsed it: if not for his father in lawe <hi>Saule,</hi> yet at leste for his dearly beloued and sworne brother <hi>Ionathas.</hi> But no such thing came in his minde, as <hi>M.

Allen</hi> sayth this matter is more plainly proued, by the Galaadites, that fasted seuen dayes after the buriall of <hi>Saule</hi> and <hi>Ionathas,</hi> and he is suer, there can no reasonable cause be alleaged of their fasting, but onely
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2890:177"/>
to aske pardon for their sinnes. I take this to be a more resonable cause, that they fasted and humbled them selues before God, because they did see the wrath of God against the whole people in the calamitie of the king &amp; his sonne, whose contumelious ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling by the vncircumcised, stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the dishonor of God. And this was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon among the Israelites in any great calamitie or daunger, or to shew their sorrow for prophanation of Gods glory. And any of these are more reasonable causes, then the superstitious surmise of <hi>Beda,</hi> with his curious conceit of the six ages of the worlde, where other make seuen and eight ages.</p>

He sayth in dede the wordes can haue no other sence, yet all that he sayeth is not gospell, but what if the truer texte of <hi>Tobias</hi> hath other wordes? First in the Greeke there is no mention at all of wine, as is in the Latine nor of setting breade and wine vpon the graue of the vertuous, but the sence is this: As before he exhorted his sonne to feede the hongry with his owne breade, and to cloth the naked with his owne gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: so nowe he willeth him to spare the breade out of his owne mouth, to bury the righteous, as he him selfe had done chap. 1. (which is a cleere interpretation of this:) but to geue nothing at all to the vngodly, or to be liberall to the rightuous euen to their death and to see them bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried honestly. As for the iustes and funeralls <hi>M. Allen</hi> drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the poore came vnto, to receiue penny dole or soule breade, appeareth in the first and second Chapters how solemne they were, when poore <hi>Tobie</hi> was fayne to steale the bodyes and bury them priuily by night, yet vpon
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2890:178"/>
that corrupt Latine texte (as it should seeme) wherevpon <hi>M. Allen</hi> buildeth, they vsed in Affrica to make sumptuous and dronken feastes, vpon the graues of men in the places of buriall, which they thought not onely to perteine to the honor of the martyrs, but also to be some comforte to the soules of the deade. This olde superstition <hi>Augustine</hi> reproueth <hi>epist.</hi> 64. <hi>Aurelio.</hi> But it is pretily renewed in the funerall feastes of the Papistes, as also the selling of oblations for the deade which he in the same place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth.</p>

Finally where as you affirme, that your aduersaries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that the dayes of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> were holy and vndefiled, and woulde make young men &amp; boyes beleue so, you must either bring forth your authors that so confesse, or else all men both young and olde must saye you are a shamelesse lyer: we confesse that in those dayes, the onely foundation Iesus Christ was taught, and the article of iustification by the onely mercy of God was preached: but yet we affirme that much straw, wodde, and other impure matter, was builded vpon the foundation, which was a preparation to the kingdome of Antichrist, which was not longe after to be reueiled. It may be a shame for you Papistes, to leaue and condemne for heresie, all that is true in those mens writings, and agreable to the scripture and to make such vaunt for a fewe supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ceremonies, and vnsincere opinions, which yet if ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther young or olde wil indifferently compare with your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations of desolation, they shall easily perceiue that they differe as much from you, as we from them.</p>

First almes giuen by a mans owne handes, is allowed for the best, but that my thinkes <hi>M. Allen</hi> shoulde kepe men out of your purgatory and not helpe them: when they be there. And here you will seeme, to be zealous in exhorting men to almes, and charge vs with iangling against it, because we affirme, that mens workes must not presume to winne hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, nor to purge sinnes, nor to medle with Christes worke of redemption, and the office of onely faith, which asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you call corruptions of Christian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous tongue of yours, who seeth not more true almes which is giuen for Gods cause in one citie where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell is preached, then in a whole cuntrey where popery is receiued? Neither doe we refuse the triall of <hi>S. Iames,</hi> with the proudest of the popish hypocrites that make most of their merites. And because you would be of that religion that <hi>S. Iames</hi> calleth holy and vndefiled, which is to visite the fatherlesse children and widowes in their affliction. If I should speake of singular persons, the triall were neither certayne nor possible, let vs therefore consider the whole states. Shew me <hi>M. Allen</hi> if thou canst for thy gutts, or name me any city in the world, where popery preuayleth, that hath made such prouision for the fatherlesse children and widowes and all other kind of poore, as is in the noble city of London and in diuers other cities and townes of this land, and by publike law appoynted to be throughout all the realme of England. I knowledge and confesse before the Lorde, that it is nothing in comparison of his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, nor our duety towards him. But yet blessed be his holy name, that it is sufficient to iustifie our profession a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Papistes, &amp; if not to stoppe their malicious mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, yet to condemne their cancred conscience of obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate lying against the manifest light of truth. And whereas <hi>M. Allen</hi> will haue vs told, that the blood of Christ ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mens workes meritorious, we will not let to tell him, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church of Christ abhorreth that blasphemy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Christes blood is made not the only nor the principall, but an accessary and helping cause of remission of sinnes &amp; eternall saluation, and will not doubt to tell him, &amp; all such hypocrites as he is, that neither see, feele, tast, nor know the mystery of Christes redemption, or any thing that ishueth vnto vs thereof, which mingle merites of men, by what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or conueiance of wordes what so euer, with the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and onely cause of our saluation the meere mercy of God. And whereas he biddeth vs come into his Church, we say to all them that are curable among them, as the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:2890:184"/>
of God hath taught vs, <hi>come out of her my people, come out of her, lest ye be partakers of her plages and torments.</hi> But nowe at the last, he returneth to his matter of mercy, affirming that after mens departure, the representation of almes by such as receiued it shall moue God exceedingly to mercy. O vaine imagination, for which he hath neither Scripture, nor doctor, for neither the example of <hi>Peter</hi> and the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Cyprian</hi> helpeth him one iote, because there is not the like comparison betwene man and God, nor betwene deliuerance from hel which is certayne, &amp; purgatory which is the controuersie.</p>

I speake not for priestes aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, (God is my iudge) I am not of that roome my selfe, and will not condemne my soule for other. But I speake for pity of the deceiued people, for compassion of the soules that lacke the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of so soueraigne a remedy, for mine owne helpe, and those that I so dearly loue, against the day of our accompt.

Neuerthelesse, let no man take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion hereby, to be slacke in his life time, or to differe his almes &amp; charitie till deathes approching. This was the preaching of that doctours dayes, this proceeded out of his golden mouth, and this sounded out of euery pulpit. And surely if you knew his life and qualities, you woulde not take him to be the priestes proctor: of whose dignity as he wrote much, so where he founde any vicious, he punished sore.

else what needeth he to make any such protestation. But he speaketh it because he beleueth it, he would fayne counter fect his speach like the Apostle, but an ape will be an ape, although he be clothed in purple. For the grounde of his belefe is not as the Apostles was, the worde of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. but the practise of men, which though they were neuer so good, yet they were such as might deceiue and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. But to the matter, the florish of this doctrine was so great in those times which he comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth to be so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that he can not finde one man that speaketh of it: but he is fayne to cite out of <hi>Damascene,</hi> that which <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> shoulde saye. Which wordes proue no more, but that almes is better geuen at the last then not at all: of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from purgatory neuer a worde. There is one word <hi>oblationibus</hi> which perhaps <hi>M. Allen</hi> would draw to masses, for he translateth it oblation in the singular number, which in the Latine is the plurall numbre. His fetch is easy to finde, the Masse though it be sayed neuer so often, yet is it called of them but one oblation. But I inferre vppon his owne conscience, <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> worde is <hi>oblationibus</hi> obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, therefore he meaneth not Masses, but onely almes deedes which in scripture are called oblations or sacrifices where with God is pleased <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. But I will let this slight geare passe and goe to the rest.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="3">3 Nowe there is an other way of reliefe by almes of other men, which for loue and pitie they bestow vpon the poore, that the soule hense departed, may through their charitie receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte. And this conteineth a double worke of mercie, principally towardes the deceased, for whome it was geuen: and then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the needy that receiued present benefit thereby: and it singularly redoundeth to the spirituall gaine both of the geuer, and the person for whose sake it is geuen. And this kinde of almes is it, which good <hi>Tobie</hi> did commende vnto his sonne, being so much more meritorious to the person that procureth it, then the other whiche we spake of before, because it is grounded not onely of loue towardes a mans owne proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">

gift of compassion, and tender loue that we beare euen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them which can neither helpe vs, nor them selues. It is nothing els but a wing of prayer, and a token of earnest sute for the party on whome it is practised, which no man will vse for his neighbours good, that list not do it before in his owne behalfe. This effectuall supplication by wordes and workes together, is as straunge nowe a dayes in our country, either for the liuing or the departed, either in our owne lackes, or in other mens necessities, as it was common in olde time, and commended in the scripture. <hi>Bona est oratio cum ieiunio &amp; eleemosina:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tob. 12.</hi>
                     </note> Prayer is soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, ioyned with almes and fasting: the which being done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the liue or deade, is with speede by Angels ministery, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into heauen. For I take it (and so the text excedingly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth) that the bitter prayers which the Angell so commended in that good father, and which had such good successe, was made in the funerals of the faithfull departed. <hi>Quando orabas cum lachrimis</hi> (sayth Raphael) <hi>&amp; sepeliebas mortuos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. Ego obtuli orationem tuam Domino.</hi> Tobie: when thou with teares prayd and buried the deade, I offered vp thy prayers to our Lord God. he seemeth to tearme that, prayers with weeping, which in other placies of scripture is called, mourning ouer the deade. And weying the wordes with out affection, it must needes be graunted that the iuste funeralls had and required prayers with weeping, and that the Angels of God do speedely offer such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall requeste vp to the presens of the Maiesty, as well to the reliefe of the dead, as to the comfort of the procurer. But I would be lothe to descant vpon Gods worde for the beating out of any newe doctrine or deuised meaning, or to auouch a sense not knowen to the time of perfect spring in religion. Therefore to go surely to worke, I will looke about me for example of this good <hi>Tobies</hi> almes, and prayers for the poore departed soules, that we may learne withall, not onely to be beneficiall to our selues, but to our neighbours both a liue and deade. All the antiquitie here offer to take my part in so good and so knowen a quarell.

He woulde make fooles beleue, that prayers and almes as they are in deede not so common as they should be, yet among vs are not at all. But omitting that sclaunder with the rest, almes for soules departed is neuer mentioned in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And although <hi>Tobies</hi> story be no canonicall scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet it is not once mentioned, nor by any reasonable or sober man can be imagined there. But who can let <hi>M. Allen</hi> to dreame that <hi>Tobies</hi> prayer and almes were for the deade whome he buried? yet who can beare him when he bosteth, that all antiquitie doth offer to take his parte, and he may haue whome he will to testifie the same. This is a strange matter <hi>(M. Allen)</hi> that you maye haue your choyse of so many and will not vouchsafe to bring one that so doth write of <hi>Tobies</hi> prayer and almes. But you will say you meane generally of almes and prayers for the dead and thereof you haue store of auncient testimonies, and the more auncient the better. I will not deny but you haue much drosse and dragges of the latter sorte of doctors, and the later the fuller of drosse. But bring me any worde out of <hi>Iustinus</hi> martyr, <hi>Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> or any that did write with in one 100. yeares after Christ, that alloweth prayer or almes for the deade, and I will saye you are as good as your worde. But if neither you nor any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist for you, be able to doe it out of these which I haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (which are the most auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t writers whose workes are

But you will come neare the time if you can not come to it. And <hi>Origen</hi> shall speake for you all that he can, or at least wise as much as you will giue him leaue to say. But if a man might be as bold to pose you (<hi>M.

Wherefore that this may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident I will rehearse the whole testimony of <hi>Origen,</hi> which <hi>M.

The former men did celebrate the daye of their natiuitie, louing but one life and not hoping for any other after this. But now we doe not celebrate the daye of natiuitie, seeing it is the entraunce of sorrowes and tentations, but we celebrate the day of death as that which is the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of all sorrowes, and the escaping of all tentations. VVe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the day of death, because they doe not dye that seeme to dye. Therefore also doe we make memories of the Sainctes and deuoutly keepe the memories of our parents or friendes dying in the faith, as much reioysing in their rest, as desiring for our selues also a godly finishing in faith. So therefore we doe not celebrate the day of natiuitie, because they which dye shall liue perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And thus we celebrate it, calling togither the deuout men with the Priestes, the faithfull with the clergy, inuiting also the needy and poore, filling the fatherlesse and widdowes with foode. that our festiuitie or ioyfulnes may be done in remembraunce of the rest which is vnto the soules departed, whose memory we cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, &amp; may be made vnto vs a sauour of sweetenes in the sight of the eternall God.</hi> By this place it is manifest that <hi>Origen</hi> &amp; the east Church in his time acknowledged no purgatory paynes, because he confesseth death to be the ende of all sorrowes to the faithfull. Secondly that they pray not for their friendes soules, as being in torment, but that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioysed for them because they were in rest. Thirdly that the prayers which they vsed in the memories of the dead, were not for the deade, but for them selues which were aliue, that they might likewise dye in the fayth as their friendes had done before them. Fourthly, that the assembly of the cleargy and people, with the feeding of the poore, was not to pray for the deade, nor to merite for their soules, but to reioyse for the rest of the deade, and to be a sacrifice of thankesgiuing for them that were aliue. This one testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Origen</hi> shall testifie what the iudgement of the greeke Church was concerning purgatory &amp; prayers for the dead from the Apostles time vnto his dayes. I wotte well super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition in the Latine Church was somewhat forwarder, in as much as there was the seate of Antichrist appoynted to

be set vp according to the reuelation of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who iudged that <hi>Lateinos</hi> was the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the beastes name spoken of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13. By the way it may be noted, how <hi>M. Allen</hi> translateth <hi>religiosos</hi> the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men, which worde might well be vsed, but that he would haue fooles to thinke, that there were Monkes, and fryers in that tyme, which were vsed to be called to burials, but it is playne that <hi>Origen</hi> calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religious, whom by and by after he calleth faithfull. Moreouer, in the latter end where he libbeth of the conclusion of <hi>Origens</hi> wordes, he translateth: <hi>vt fiat festiuitas nostra in memoriam, &amp;c.</hi> That the memoriall of their rest might be kept solemnly, yet when he hath clipped, shauen, pared, gelded, and falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that he can, the dead be in rest, and not in purgatory, for whose sake he imagineth in <hi>Origens</hi> time they gaue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. But next followeth a worthy authoritie of <hi>Clement</hi> the Apostles owne scholer, and he forsooth in his Epistle to <hi>Iames</hi> the brother of our Lord, commendeth obites, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and almes for the dead. But why doe ye not <hi>M. Allen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse his owne wordes as they are written in his Epistle? belike you are ashamed of his lousie latine, and thinke that all wise men would say you are madde, if you beleue that <hi>Clemens</hi> which liued in the Apostles time could write no better stile, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cobling counterfecter of those epistles. For shame away with such a durty doctor, as writeth to <hi>S. Iames</hi> to see there be no mise tordes <hi>murium stercora</hi> among the fragments of the Lordes portion, &amp;c. <hi>Epist.</hi> 2. He was a beastly asse that writ such nasty stuffe, and thought to make the world beleue, that such a godly and learned father as <hi>Clemens</hi> was, would write so foolishly, so barbarously, so fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, so malapertly, of such bables as were not inuented 600, yeares after, to so holy and excellent an Apostle as <hi>S. Iames</hi> was: but the olde prouerbe must alwayes be true: <hi>Draffe is good enough for swine.</hi> But to put all out of doubt, the example of <hi>Iobes</hi> sacrifice and almes which were auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable for his children, and friendes, sheweth that the almes of men aliue profite them that be deade, In deede I reade in the booke of <hi>Iobes</hi> sacrifice, and prayer, but I reade not
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2890:188"/>
of almes giuen to merite for those that were liuing, much lesse for those that were deade. I doubt not but <hi>Iob</hi> gaue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes liberally when tyme &amp; occasion serued. But I say those places are vnfitly of <hi>M. Allen</hi> alleged to shew the force of almes, where no worde of almes is spoken. Howebeit he sheweth his reason afterward, why he allegeth this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iob,</hi> because <hi>Chrysostome</hi> applyeth it to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. I deny not but that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doth as substantially alleage this example, for prayers to profitte the deade, as he doth the saying of God, that he will protect the cittie for <hi>Dauid</hi> his seruaunts sake, what shall we say. Those good men in that declining state of the Church, to superstition, being destitute of the cleere testimonies of scripture to maintaine these plausible errors, are driuen to such simple shiftes to vpholde them, as it is great pitty to see. It seemed to <hi>Chrysostome</hi> the best waye to staye the people from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate mourning, but he might haue vsed a better way, if he had comforted them as the Apostle teacheth. 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.

VVhich, because it was solemnely presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Gods minister before the holy altare, in the face of the whole faithfull assembly, harde at then try vnto the soueraigne sacrifice, was highly alwayes esteemed, and called an oblation for the departed, or an offeringe. And it was most practised at the mindes of the departed, and memoriall dayes, which were very many at the beginning of those happy times of our forefathers, the deuotion of the good Christians then very feruent: and be not nowe a dayes, as they faulsely affirme, increased by superstition,

But else commonly besides the blessed Sacrifice of the newe Testament, which was alwayes the chiefe meane of Gods mercy, to both quicke and deade, and in euery minde or memory for the soules principally procured, the offering of some part either of the deceaseds owne goods, or his louers, for the vpholding the ministery, was also made.

               <p n="1">1 IN the latter ende of the fift Chapter was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a whole rancke of Gods holy host, &amp; all the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed band of Martyrs and Sainctes to stand on their side. But this promise is no soner made then it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. The title in deede talketh of almes presented for the deceased in time of the holy sacrifice, but the treatise hath neuer a one that speaketh for it. But <hi>M.

But if we shall rather beleue <hi>Iustinus Martyr,</hi> one of the most aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and authentical writers of the Church, whose workes remayne: the oblation that was made after the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was of almes for the reliefe of the poore.

And as for the councell <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charense</hi> which was helde 4. or 5. hundreth yeares after <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus</hi> time, yet proueth nothing but the commemoration of the deade, and a collation of the faythfull but no oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the deade. Neuerthelesse to help the matter be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 2. other prouinciall councells, namely the councell of <hi>Vase,</hi> and the 4 of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which excommunicate all such as hinder in any wise, the oblations for the departed, and these decrees also are confirmed by the 6. generall councel holden at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Therefore these ministers that be in the ruffe of their newe communion, must be thrust out of the olde communion with all a lye a. But whether is he worthy to be thrust, that regarding no communion either olde or new of any trueth, but his common vnion of lying and rayling together, hath falsyfied both the decrees of <hi>Vase</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> what <hi>M.

They which reteine, the oblations of the deade and make delay to deliuer them to the Churches, are to be cast out of the Church as infidels. For it is certaine that this prouoking to wrath of the mercy of God recheth euen to the vttermost denying of the faith. Because both the faithfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from their bodye, are defrauded of the fullfilling of their desires, and the poore of the comfort of foode and necessary sustentation. They therefore that are such, are to be compted as murderers of the poore and such as beleiue not the iudgement of God, wherefore one of the fathers hath put this in his writinges, with agreable meaning whereby he saith. To take away any thing from a mans freind is thefte, but to defraude the Church is sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> What other thing can be gathered out of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees? but that those men are noted with censure, which keepe backe such thinges as men that are departed had bequethed, to the Churches, for the releefe of the poore, what is this to oblation or sacrifice for the deade: is it all one to speake of oblations of the deade and oblations for the deade? With <hi>M. Allen</hi> it is all one, for after he hath sayed, that the Councells do excommunicate all them that hinder the oblations for the departed, he addeth that the canons of the Councells runne thus, that they which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the oblations of the departed are excommunicated.

For first I must tell you, that these three lines which are all that he hath written sounding that way, are found in three bookes which all were written by him, when he was an heretike, &amp; separated from the catholike Church. And therefore it may well be, that all that he speaketh of prayers and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the deade, was onely in the conuenticles of the <hi>Montanistes,</hi> of which sect he was an earnest defender, rather then in the catholike Church. And this coniecture seemeth the more probable, because <hi>Cyprian</hi> which was afterward a catholike Bishop in the same city, where <hi>Tertullian</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

But to the matter: <hi>Tertullian</hi> him selfe shall say for me, that the same custome, with many other which he there rehearseth, hath no ground in the holy Scripture. <hi>Harum &amp; aliarum eiusmodi disciplinarum, si leges expostules scripturarum, nullam inuenies, traditio tibi praetendetur autrix, consuetudo confirmatrix &amp; fides obseruatrix.</hi> Of those and such like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, if you require the lawes of the Scriptures, you shall finde none, tradition shall be pretended to you to be the author, Custome the confirmer, and faith the obseruer.

                  </gap>t the Scriptures to find that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> confesseth is not to be found in them. I knowe the Papistes will aunswere that tradition is of as good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as the Scripture, &amp; is the word of God vnwritten, as well as the Scripture is the word of God written. But why then doe they not obserue all other things, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the same place affirmeth to be tradition, if tradition be the word of God, why doe they not giue to them that are new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptised a temper of milke and hony, and from the day of their baptisme forbid dayly washing all the weeke after? Why doe they not count it a wicked thinge to fast on the Sunday, or to pray and worship God on their knees? Why doe they not count it a wicked thinge to fast betwene Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2890:195"/>
&amp; Whitsontide, or to pray on their knees all that time? Finally why doe not they crosse them selues in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, at euery steppe they set forth, at comming in, at going out, at putting on of garmentes, at putting on of shoes, at washing, at the tables, at lighting of candles, at beddes, at stooles, and at all thinges, what so euer they doe? What aunswere can they here make, but that their Church may dispense as well with the word of God vnwritten, which they cal tradition, as she doth against the word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in the holy Scriptures. So that alwayes what so euer they prate of antiquitie, customs, traditions, vnwritten ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, or the word of God vnwritten, the authority of their blasphemous church is aboue them all. Now to the second testimony alleged out of <hi>Tertullian. S. Ieronym</hi> shall testifie for vs, that this booke, as the other that followeth, was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against the Church, so was also his booke <hi>de corona mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litis,</hi> when he was out of the Church, whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, what good authorities they are, to proue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church. This booke <hi>de castitate,</hi> he wrote to diswade a friend of his, whose wife was dead, that he should not marry agayne, condemning second mariage for adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as <hi>Montanus</hi> his maister did, and laboureth to proue that he could not pray for his departed wiues soule, nor offer the yearely oblation, if he married an other. To the same purpose he reasoneth in his booke <hi>de Monogamia,</hi> where the wordes alleged by <hi>M Allen</hi> be so corrupted in all the coppyes, that <hi>Beatus Rhenamus</hi> confesseth that no sense could be made of them, and these wordes are the coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall correction of <hi>Beatus Rhenamus.</hi> But let them be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the wordes of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as they seeme to be. Here more manifestly then before he brocheth his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of condemning second mariages, for in that the wife prayeth for her husbands soule, and offereth, &amp;c: he would proue that she is still married to him, and that she commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth adultery if she take an other, directly contrary to the word of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. yet see either the ignorance or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> malice of this <hi>Allen,</hi> that allegeth those words of this writer, by which he condemneth them that allow second

mariage, as denyers of the resurrection, agaynst vs that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers for the deade to be lawfull by the word of God. And vseth the same reason and wordes to proue prayers for the dead to be allowable, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> vseth to proue second mariages to be damnable. For that accompt which <hi>Tertullian</hi> sayth men and women are bound vnto, one to an other, he meaneth of the promise of mariage once made betwene them, which <hi>M.

But now you will shewe, that prayer and almes helpeth not them that dye in mortall sinne, and that beside your <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> with whose cloutes you cloy your booke, you woulde fayne proue out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Epistle of <hi>S. Iohn cap.</hi> 5. For that which <hi>S.

But you that dare not presume to make any interpretation without authoritie of the olde Martyrs, when all commeth to all, haue none to father your new exposition vppon, but <hi>Denys</hi> the charterhouse Monke, a yesterdayes bird. But seeing you
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:2890:200"/>
are not onely voyd of all auncient authoritie, but also haue all the olde writers against you, that euer interpreted or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged this place, let vs see what is your reason. Forsooth the letter well weighed, maketh much for you, by the way it may be noted, that you call the word of God the letter, in that sense that <hi>S. Paule</hi> sayth the letter killeth, but I omitte that grosse contumely against the holy Scriptures, where <hi>S. Paule</hi> sayth the letter killeth, he meaneth not that the holy Scriptures killeth in which is contemed life, but that the law which onely commaundeth and giueth no power to fulfill it pronounceth sentence of death to them that breake it. But to follow your reason. There is no crime so greeuous, that man may commit in this life, but the Church prayeth for it &amp; is often heard: therfore it may be thought that the party must be deceased of whom such diuersitie of deserts doth arise. I deny your antecedent: For the church of Christ, prayeth not for them that sinne against the holy Ghost, &amp; our Sauiour Christ affirmeth that he which sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth against the holy Ghost shall neuer be forgiuen, who so euer pray for him, and of such sayth <hi>S. Iohn, that there is a sinne vnto death, for which we ought not to pray. Samuell</hi> was not heard when he prayed for <hi>Saule,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. <hi>Ieremy</hi> is oftentimes forbidden to pray for the obstinate Iewes, <hi>Iere.</hi> 7.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14. And the Lord testifieth, that if <hi>Noach, Daniell</hi> and <hi>Iob</hi> prayed for the wicked, they should not be heard. <hi>Ezec.</hi> 14. Therefore there be sinnes for which the Church ought not to pray, and though she should pray, yet she should not be heard, euen of men remayning in this life, your second reason (as I conceiue it) is, that so long as men are in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>his world, they may repent, &amp; then sinne is not to death. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>S. Iohn</hi> meaneth, that they that dyed without bond of deadly sinne are to be prayed for: your antecedent as before is false, for the Apostle to the Hebrewes the sixt chapter, sheweth that there be some which sinne so horribly in this life, that it is vnpossible for them to be renewed by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce. So that your exposition being both voyd of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and contrary to the manifest word of God, of none that is wise, or godly can be receiued. Beside this the whole
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:2890:200"/>
context of <hi>S. Iohns</hi> wordes doe plainly declare, that he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of prayers for the brethern that are liuing, and not for them that are dead. But I am to blame to spende so many wordes in a matter so manifest. If the holy Ghost had euer allowed prayer for the dead, he would once at the lest haue vttered the same plainly, in holy canonicall Scriptures. But <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as wise a man as <hi>M.

                     <hi>It can not be denied</hi> (sayth he) <hi>but that the soules of the deceased be relieued, when the sacrifice of our redemer is offered for them, or almes bestowed in their behalfe in the Church. But in deede these are profitable to none, but to such as in their life deserued that those things after their departure might doe them good. For there is a state of life that is neither so perfect but it may well haue neede of these helpes after death, not yet so very euill, but such thinges may well suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them after their departure. Mary there is a kinde of conuersation so vertuous, that it requireth no such ayed, and an other kinde so wicked, that those which passed their former life therein, can haue after their passage no reliefe by such meanes: for by our merites in this life we do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine, that after our deaths we may either atteine to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or els be voide of all helpes.

But the matter seemeth to be farre otherwise then <hi>M. Allen</hi> doth take it. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the 6. Epistle of his first booke, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that there was a decree made in the assembly of the Church, before his tyme, that no brother departing out of this life, should name any of the clergy to be his executor, or ouerseer of his will. <hi>Ac si quis hoc fecisset non offerre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur pro eo, nec sacrificium pro dormitione eius celebraretur.

For he is not worthy to be named at the aultar of God in the prayer of the Priestes, which would call away his Priestes &amp; ministers the Leuites from the aultar. And therefore seeing <hi>Victor,</hi> contrary to the forme giuen by the Priestes in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was so bold to make <hi>Geminus Faustinus</hi> an elder his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor, there is no cause that oblation should be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you for his falling a sleepe, or that any prayer in his name should be frequented in the Church, &amp;c. By these wordes it appeareth first that <hi>Cyprian</hi> in these termes, sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Priest, aultar, alludeth to the sacrifices of thankesgiuing in the lawe, because he vseth also that name of Leuites by which he calleth Gods ministers. For as for the sacrifice propitiatory, was offered in the law, only by the high Priest once in the yeare. So that he meaneth no other oblation or sacrifice for the dead but the sacrifice of thankesgiuing, which was for their godly departure. And therefore he
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2890:205"/>
calleth it not a sacrifice for their sinnes, but for their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a sleepe. And by prayer he meaneth nor prayer for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery of the deade out of purgatory, but as <hi>Origen</hi> sayth for the faithfull liuing, to haue the like godly departure as he had that was fallen a sleepe. And therfore he sayth not, that such a one is not worthy to be praied for, but he is not worthy to be named in the prayer, which was made for them that remayned to ende their dayes happily, as such a one, or such a one whose names were recited in those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, had already fulfilled their course. For otherwise, what so euer <hi>M.

The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church when it is most seuere, is to bring to repentaunce them that are in life, not to rage against them that are deade which can not repent. Nor to reiect any man vtterly, but him that is certainly knowne to be vtterly forsaken of God. But this <hi>Geminius Victor</hi> of whom <hi>Cyprian</hi> thus writeth, was a good Christian, in somuch that <hi>Cyprian</hi> him selfe calleth him his brother. <hi>Geminius Victor frater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster de saeculo excedens.</hi> Our brother <hi>Geminius Victor</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of this world, &amp;c.

Wherefore it may appeare that this punishment, was only a note of ignominy to <hi>Victor</hi> him selfe for his transgression at his departure, &amp; especially an example for the rest of the brethren (as <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> sayth) that they cal not away the ministers of God from his seruice, to worldly affayres, lest they be likewise noted of infamy when they are deade.</p>

O intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blasphemy. Christ offered vp but one sacrifice, and that you affirme to be before his death: Christ offered but once and that you affirme to be at his supper. By that one sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which Christ did once offer, he redemed vs from all our sinnes, and that you affirme to haue bene offered in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.

But in this sacrifice, there is thankes geuing and commemoration of the flesh of Christ, which he offered, for vs, and his bloude which the same God shedde for vs. In his 23. epistle to <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> he sheweth, that sacraments, take the names of those thinges whereof they are sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by a certeine similitude and liknesse that they haue vnto the thinges, them selues whereof they are sacraments.

Here it is manifest that <hi>Cyprian</hi> calleth the sacrament a sacrifice, as he calleth it the passion of Christ, and the remembraunce of his passion. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> also sheweth that by the name of the sacrifice of the Church, he meaneth not the sacrifice of the Masse, which they call propitiatory for the sinnes of the quicke and the deade but the sacrifice of thankes geuing and prayers who writeth these wordes. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 34. <hi>Igitur non sacrificia sanctificant hominem, non enim indiget sacrificio deus sed conscientia eius, quae offert sanctificat sacrificium, pura existens &amp; praestat acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptare deum quasi ab amico.</hi> Therefore these sacrifices doe not sanctifie a man, for God needeth no sacrifices, but the conscience of him that doeth offer being puer, doth san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the sacrifice, and causeth God to accept it as of a freinde. <hi>Iustinus</hi> martyr also <hi>Dial.

Iudaeos</hi> in plaine wordes affirmeth, that the sacrifice of breade and wine which the Church offereth, is the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of thankes geuing in remembraunce of the passion of Christ. The like places might be brought out almost of all the olde writers, but for tediousnesse, and yet to shew how vnproperly some of them vsed the name of sacrifice, I will cite one place out of Ambrose, <hi>Ad virginem lapsam. Si fuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses communi sorte defuncta flessent te modicum propter deside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium parentes, sed exultassent granditer quia immaculatam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t virginem hostiam viuam, domino, propitiatricem suorum videlicet delictoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> If thou hadst dyed by the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lotte, thy parents would haue lamented a litle for desire of thee, but they woulde haue greatly reioysed, bycause they had sent before them an immaculate virgine, a liuing sacrifice, propitiatory to the Lord for their sinnes. Here is the death of a virgine called a sacrifice propitiatory for sinnes, but very vnproperly. Therefore if the fathers haue spoken any thing vnproperly of the celebration of the Lordes Supper in calling it a sacrifice or by any like terme, which haue in other places expounded their meaning, to be onely a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce, a commemoration, a thankes geuing for the onely true sacrifice of Christes death which is the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our sinnes, we must not contrary to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vppon couller of their wordes set vp a newe and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemous sacrifice to deface the onely sacrifice of Christ, much lesse breake out into such open blasphemies, as this <hi>Allen</hi> doth, that affirmeth this sacrifice of the Masse, to be the onely practice of Christes eternall priesthoode, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of <hi>Melchizedech</hi> which the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <hi>Melchizedech</hi> with Christ in all thinges in which he was comparable, neuer teacheth as any parte of his priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. For that which they builde vppon, which make any resemblance of <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> offering of breade and wine, with Christes institution, is a false grounde, for <hi>Melchizedech</hi> did not offer but bring forth, not to God, but to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his company, not a sacrifice, but a refectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of breade and wine: <hi>Hieronym</hi> confesseth that Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedech <hi>protulit panem &amp; vinum ad Euaginum. &amp; in Quaest.

And that he brought it not forth to sacrifice, but to refresh the souldeirs of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>: Beside that it is plaine by the texte that <hi>Melchizedech</hi> being both a king and a priest, as a king liberally entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Abraham</hi> and his armie, and as a priest blessed him: we reade also in scholastica historia. <hi>cap.</hi> 46. <hi>At vero Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedech rex Salem, obtulit ei panem &amp; vinum quod quasi expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens Iosephus</hi> ait: <hi>Ministrauit exercitui xemia, &amp; multam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiam rerum opportunarum simul exhibuit, &amp; super epulat benedixit deum qui Abrahae subdiderat inimicos.</hi> But <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedech</hi> king of <hi>Salem</hi> offered vnto him breade and wine which <hi>Iosephus</hi> expounding, sayth, he ministred vnto his army giftes of enterteinment and gaue them also aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of thinges necessary, and beside that feaste he blessed God which had subdued vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And out of doubt if the bringing forth of breade and wine had bene any thinge perteining to the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> the Apostle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. woulde not haue omitted to haue compared it with Christ. But of all others folies this is the greatest, that when the Papistes haue prated neuer so longe of the sacrifice of breade and wine, at the laste, they will haue no breade nor wine at all in their sacrifice: wherein they are not onely contrary to those of the olde writers which compare the celebration of the Lordes Supper, which sometime they call the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of breade and wine (and yet but a sacrifice of thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing) with <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> breade and wine: but also they are contrary to them selues.</p>
               <p>As for the rest of that rayling, which he calleth a descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the new communion, might aptly and truely be verified of the newe sacrifice of the masse. And that I may aunswere wordes with matter, I will vrge the Papistes to tell me, what we say or doe in the celebration of the holy communion, which Christ commaunded vs not to say and doe, or what Christ did or commaunded vs to doe, which
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2890:211"/>
we doe not therein? If all the dogged Papists in the world, be not able to shew our default herein, as we haue shewed their infinite abuses and blasphemies, of their masse, then is our celebration the very true communion of the body and blood of Christ, and theirs a very wast of Gods worshippe, a canker of religion, &amp;c. and a very blasphemy of all bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemies, that euer were vttered sith the beginning of the world, whereby euery scalde hedge priest, is made not only equall, but also superior to Christ him selfe, whom he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth to offer, who could not be offered by any, but by him selfe.</p>

VVell these be plaine practises, no heretike can denie but they haue bene so vsed of the whole Church of God, with many such other like in that holy action: which can not in any case stande with bare breade, or any other way of presence, but onely the proper, true, and bodily presence of Christes owne person. A doctors wordes may be misconstrued, may be picked out of place: may be writhen and wastred by false teachers, but a mans example can not lightly be misconstrued. And therefore heretikes, whose pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is alwayes by sutteltie to deceiue the simple, will neuer make discours by the practise of the Church, or exercise and example of the auncient learned men through out the Church of Christ: hauing enough for their meaning, to racke a place or two out of the fathers whole workes, that may seeme to the ignoraunt to set forth their errour. So if thou woulde knowe whether that place that our aduersaries impudently doe alleage out of <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, against the soueraignty of the see of <hi>Rome,</hi> was in deede written for their seditious purpose, beholde the practise of the same father, and thou shals finde him selfe exercise iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

Is it not now a very false suggestion to the poore people, that this blessed man in so plaine vtteraunce of his meaning by workes and not by wordes, shoulde yet be brought as a witnesse to condemne him selfe? though the wordes being well vnderstande make for no suche meaning in deede, as by others it hath bene sufficiently declared. The like impudencie it is, to alleage <hi>S. Bernarde</hi> against the Masse or the presence of Christ in the blessed Sacrament. Good man I dare say for him, he sayde Masse euery daye, if he were well at ease: For other busines, did not commonly let them in those dayes, from that worke of all other most necessarie. So the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> for the improuing of inuocation of holy Sainctes, is no more but an abuse of the simples ignorance: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, that he and all other of that time did practise prayers both often to all holy martyrs, and sometimes peculiarly to such, whome for patronage they did especially chuese of deuotion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the rest. I speake not this, that any might hereby iudge the doctors wordes to stande against their owne deedes: but that euery man maye perceiue, that where the workes and practise of all men be so plaine, their words in some one place founde darke, can not by any meanes be preiudiciall to that trueth which in all other placies they plainely set forth by wordes, and by the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent testimonie of their owne practise, to the worlde proteste the same.

Allen</hi> before he commeth to the matter, maketh much a do to shew how much more certayne, the practise is, then the wordes of any doctor: because the wordes may be mistru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, or wrested, the practise can not be altered. As though he could shew vs any practise, but that which is vttered in their wordes, in which if there be any obscuritie or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie, there shall be as great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie of their workes as of their doctrine, as they vsed the name of sacrifice in their teaching, so they vse it, in declaring what they did practise according to their teaching. And therefore it is not worth a straw that <hi>M. Allen</hi> thinketh, we may knowe their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rather by their practise then by their wordes: except he could either in picture, or in vision, describe vnto vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing that they did. But let vs consider the examples of those thinges, which he bringeth in to proue that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is more certeyne then wordes. First he can not deny, but the wordes of <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Theodoretus</hi> stand with vs, that the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christes supper is a figure of his body and bloode and not the same naturally. <hi>But the practise must expound the words, not to stand with vs. For they did so carefully keepe it, adore it, shew it to be worshipped, prayed to it, yea they taught children to call it God and Lorde, which they would not haue done, if they had not beleued it to be the very body of Christ. For this is cited</hi> 1. <hi>Theodoret. Dial.</hi> 2. <hi>in the margent.</hi> His wordes be not set downe because they be directly against transubstantiation, and nothing fauouring the grosse ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined presence of Christes body in the sacrament: for he calleth the sacrament <hi>signa mystica,</hi> the mysticall signes, and the diuine mysteries which represent the body of Christ, that is a true body and not fantasticall or absorpt of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:2890:217"/>
as the Eutichians dreamed, wherefore it is playne that the adoration he speaketh of, is nothing else but the reuerent estimation of the sacrament, to be that which by Christ it is ordeyned to be, and not any knocking or knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as <hi>M. Allen</hi> would haue vs beleue. <hi>Augustine</hi> also vppon the 98. Psalme is cited, belike to proue the adoration, who in deede, alloweth the adoration of the body of Christ whereof that is a sacrament, but neither can you proue out of that place, that he would haue the sacrament hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor that the sacrament is the very body of Christ, but euen in the same place speaking of the sacrament, he sayth in the person of Christ, <hi>non hoc corpus quod videtis manduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi estis, &amp; bibituri illum sanguinem quem fusuri sunt qui me crucifigent. Sacramentum aliquod vobis commendaui, spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter intellectum viuificabit vos.</hi> You shall not eate this body which you see, not drinke this blood which they shal shed, which shall crucifie me. I haue commended to you a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which being spiritually vnderstoode shall quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you. As for <hi>Dionysius</hi> because he is a cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfect antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie I will not vouchasafe to aunswere him. <hi>Basill</hi> in his booke <hi>de spiritu sancto, cap.</hi> 27. hath these wordes: <hi>The wordes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation when the breade of thankes geuing, and the cuppe of blessing is shewed, which of the holy Apostles hath lefte vs in writinge?</hi> Before we goe any further, I will take this by the waye, that what so euer it was, that he spake of, it is not tought by the scripture, no more then many other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies that he rehearseth in the same place. Howbeit it is plaine enough, that he meaneth not, that the wordes of inuocation were sayed vnto the breade, or the cuppe, but vnto God who was called vpon to blesse those his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that they might be sanctified to the holy vse of Christ his institution. The shewing of the breade and the cuppe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was not to adore it (as <hi>M. Allen</hi> dreameth) for then he woulde haue called it the body and bloode of Christ, but either to stirre vp the people to praye effectually, or to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish them that all thinges were readye that they might prepare them selues to communicate. And whereas he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth out of <hi>Augustine De Trinit. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:2890:217"/>
were taught to call it God and Christ, he shamefully abuseth his reader, for no such thinge can be gathered out of <hi>Augustins</hi> wordes, which are these: <hi>Illas etiam nubes &amp;c. Nowe as touching those cloudes or fire, howe the Angells did make them, or tooke them vppon them to signifie that which they did bring message of: Although the Lorde or the holy Ghost was shewed in these formes what man a liue doth know? euen as yong children know not what is set on the altar, and when the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of piety is finished is spent out, whereof or how it is made, whereof it is taken into the vse of religion? And if they shoulde neuer learne by experience of their owne, or of others, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer see that shewe of thinges but in the celebration of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where it is offered and giuen and saide vnto them with most graue authoritie whose body and bloude it is, they woulde beleue nothing els but onely that the Lorde hath appeared to the eyes of mortall men in that liknesse, and that out of such a side being striken that the same liquor did flowe.</hi> These wordes are plaine that <hi>Augustine</hi> affirmeth that no man knoweth more of those shapes, in which the Angells did appeare, then young children would imagine of the presence of Christ in the sacrament, if they were not otherwise instructed, then in telling them when they receiue it, that it is the body of Christ. wherby the cleane contrary to that which <hi>Allen</hi> affirmeth is plainely gathered, that children were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise instructed, first by experience, bycause they sawe breade els where, then in the celebration, and also by doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, when they were able to vnderstande that it was not the Lorde him selfe in the shape of breade, but onely a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and representation of him. And by the waye note here, one practise of a notable error in <hi>Augustines</hi> time, that the sacrament of the Lordes supper was geuen to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which wist not what it ment, contrary to the worde of God, who requireth men to examine them selues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they receiue it, wherefore if any other practise were in his time, or allowed by him contrary to Gods worde, we are no more bounde vnto it, then vnto this, which euen the Papistes them selues will confesse to be erroneous. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally what the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did by that they were sclaundered
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:2890:218"/>
with all, is a sory proofe, they were sclaundered to haue worshipped an Asses heade, to kill men and eate them, to vse all maner of beastlines in their metings. The rest of the practise that <hi>M. Allen</hi> nameth, with out shewe of proofe, I passe ouer as vnworthy of aunswere. The practise of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> although it were much more modest then of his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, yet can it not be excused, but it was contrary to his doctrine whereby he reproued an other in that he was not altogether cleare him selfe. <hi>Bernarde</hi> was but of late time, wherefore although he might note some abuses of the Masse, yet he might also saye it him selfe, but how often I can not tell. Touching <hi>Ambrose,</hi> which was sodeinely made a byshop, before he was a perfect Christian, if some steppes of hethenishe inuocation or rethoricall apostrophees and prosopopees appeare to be in him, and some other also about his time, yet was not that generally receiued of all the Church in his time, nor agreable to the doctrine of <hi>S. Paule</hi> who sheweth that we can inuocate none but him in whome we beleue, which to all true Christians is God onely.</p>

This blessed man therefore being banished, by the meanes of the Empresse <hi>Eudoxia,</hi> for the defense of the Ecclesiasticall discipline, &amp; there in exile departing out of this world, was after her death by the happy and gracious childe <hi>Theodosius</hi>

They so set forth not onely the substance of the thinge, which standeth in prayer and sacrifice, but also do proue against the enemies of good ordre, that the smallest ceremonies that our Churchies of late haue vsed, were not lately taken vp by our couetousnesse and superstition, but with more aboundance, and numbre, and continuance, and solemnytie, practised in the flour of Christes Church, in diuers principall partes of the worlde: as at Hierusalem and Constantinople: by the praysing and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the grauest fathers of our faith.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="2">2 Why <hi>M. Allen?</hi> what a mockery is this? do you make bragge in the title of your chapter, that you will shewe the practise of all holy men in words and prayers for the dead, and nowe beginne your examples no higher then at <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes</hi> translation, which was well neare 400. yeares after Christ? <hi>The people with great plenty of lightes, brought</hi> Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes <hi>body to Constantinople. VVell this ceremony in cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing torches at burialls being taken of the Gentiles, they vsed to honour the memory of them that were deade, as the ceremonies of the Heralds are vsed for the same ende.</hi> What more? <hi>The Emperour prayed for his fathers and mothers soules, and as M. Allen thinketh</hi> (but the story sayth not so) <hi>he prayed to</hi> S. Chrysostome <hi>for them.</hi> What else? Atticus <hi>caused masse to be sayd for him,</hi> that maketh vp all. But where is any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:2890:219"/>
of masse or sacrifice of the masse <hi>M. Allen</hi>? Are you such a cunning interpreter, to expound <hi>celebrare sacra so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnia</hi> to say masse? In deed such interpretations will help you well to finde that, which else you might seeke long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the olde writers and goe without for all your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. It is all one with <hi>M. Allen,</hi> to celebrate holy solemne seruice, &amp; to say masse. But you will say, memory was made of him in the prayers, so might there be and yet his soule not praied for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but how agree you with your selfe, <hi>M. Allen?</hi> your opinion is that <hi>Theodosius</hi> praied to him as to a sainct in heauen, howe then did <hi>Atticus</hi> cause him to be prayed for as one lying in purgatory? I wisse you forget your selfe to much to vtter things so contrary, so neare togither. And as for the funeralls of <hi>Constantinus</hi> and <hi>Constantius,</hi> what so euer you say, haue no mention of Masse, nor sacrifice of Masse. In the buriall of <hi>Constantinus,</hi> there is mention of prayer for his soule according to the error of the time, and in the funeralls of <hi>Constantius,</hi> there were lights, but there is also shewed the vse of them, as I haue touched already togither with the necessitie of some of them, because they were lighted in the night. The saying of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> with the example of the buriall of <hi>Paula,</hi> shew nothing either of Masse, sacrifice, or prayer for the deade. And whereas you bable of the rites of your popish dirige, <hi>Ieronym</hi> saith, al was singing of Psalmes and giuing thankes for her godly life &amp; happy departing: <hi>Hebraeo, Graeco, Latino, Syro<expan>

Finally if your doctrine of purgatory were true, yet <hi>Ieronym</hi> describeth her to be so perfect a woman, as no prayers needed to be sayd for her, her life was so full of good workes, and her ende so full of faith. And therfore <hi>M. Allen,</hi> here is nothing for the sacrifice of the Masse, whereof you made your promise to shew the practise, in the chiefe partes of the worlde, naming Ierusalem for one, when <hi>Paula</hi> was buried at Betheleem and not at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</p>

And this was the cause that our forefathers from Christes time till our dayes haue had respecte and desire, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion serued, to be buried there, where by ordre, prayers and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice were daily had, and where the patronage of holy sainctes might best be procured.

If you may goe beyond <hi>Augustine,</hi> why may not we come short of him? But in the 18. chapter, he nameth the sacrifice of the aultar, to be profitable to the deade. This soundeth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like the matter, but if it be well marked, it maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the propitiatory sacrifice of the Masse, for euen in the same place, he calleth it the sacrifice of almes, which is but a sacrifice of thankes giuing. And that by this sacrifice he meaneth not the body of Christ, nor a propitiatory sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is manifest in his booke <hi>de fide ad Petrum diaconum, cap.</hi> 19. where he sayth, that Christ offered him selfe for vs, that sacrifice whereby God was reconciled, and that the Church offered to Christ the sacrifice of breade and wine in faith, and charitie, which is a thankes geuing and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of his death. The body of Christ is not offered to him selfe, but thankes giuing is offered to him for the offering of his body for vs. His wordes are. <hi>Firmissimè tene &amp; nulla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus dubites, ipsum vnigenitum, &amp;c.</hi> Hold most stedfastly and nothing doubt then, that the only begotten sonne of God, being made flesh, offered him selfe for vs a sacrifice &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for a sweete fauour vnto God to whom with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the holy Ghost by the Patriarches, Prophets and Priestes in time of the olde Testament, beastes were sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed: and to whom now, that is in the time of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, togither with the father and the holy Ghost, with whom his diuinitie is all one, the holy Catholike Church, throughout all the worlde, ceaseth not to offer the sacrifice of breade and wine in faith and charitie. For in these car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sacrifices there was a figuring of the flesh of Christ, which he him selfe being without sinne should offer for our sinnes. But in this sacrifice there is thankes giuing &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the flesh of Christ which he offered for vs and of his bloode which the same God shed for vs. Nowe for the other poynt of inuocation of Sainctes, <hi>M.

As for the oblations whiche he nameth in the 8. Epistle to <hi>Faustinus,</hi> be nothing but prayers. For as he doth but vary his wordes, where he sayth weeping and mourning which are all one, euen so it is all one where he sayth prayers and oblations. And whereas you say there are none of our new Bishops will followe <hi>Ambrose</hi> in such kind of letters, they can shewe better reason not to follow him where he went amisse, then your popish Prelates can shew not to followe him where he writte well. which of your Prelates will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him in his commentary vppon the epistle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes? where he so often affirmeth that a man is iustified before God by faith onely.

The other places that you allege out of <hi>Ambrose</hi> &amp; <hi>Paulinus,</hi> do not so much helpe your purpose with prayer for the deade, as they are contrary to your doctrine concerning purgatory. For <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> praying for <hi>Theodosius,</hi> calleth him a perfect seruaunt of God, but you hold that perfect men come not at all in purgatory, and therefore you haue qualified the matter by translating <hi>perfecto famulo</hi> to thy good seruaunt. <hi>Gratianus</hi> was not baptised, and therefore by your doctrine he should not come in purgatory, but strayt to hell As for the wordes that <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh of oblations for his brother <hi>Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> you doe shamefully wrest them contrary to his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For he was so farre of from beleuing his brother to be in purgatory, that he prayeth to him as a Sainct in heauen, and the oblation and sacrifice that he offereth to God, is the soule of his brother, and not prayers or masses for his soule. <hi>Tibi nunc omnipotens Deus inno xiam commendo animam, Tibi hostiam meam offero, cape propitius ac serenus fraternum munus, sacrificium sacerdotis, haec mei iam liba prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitto.</hi> To thee now O Almighty God I commend his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent soule, to thee I offer my sacrifice, receiue merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fauorably this gifte of a brother, and sacrifice of a Priest, this sacrifice as a part of my selfe, I now send before me. By which wordes as it is euident that he meaneth not the sacrifice of the masse, so it is manifest howe licentiously he vsed the name of sacrifice &amp; oblation, that we may know when he speaketh of the sacrifice of the body of Christ, he meaneth not so grosely as the Papistes take it and vse it them selues.</p>

But that I may consider these places particularly, whereof you make so great accompt: First where you will vs to take our aduantage of your translation, I say you haue falsyfied <hi>Augustines</hi> wordes and meaning in the latter ende of the first sentence, to make fooles beleue that the priuate Masse was sayd in <hi>Augustines</hi> dayes, as it is among you. First you call <hi>memoriam sui fieri ad altare</hi> which is that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of her shoulde be made at the altar: that a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry might be kepte for her, as though she woulde haue her sonne to be a chauntry priest to sing for her, &amp;c. Item you translate <hi>vnde sciret dispensari victimam sanctam,</hi> where she knew the holy hoste was bestowed, as though she had ment nothing, but that the hoste was layed vpon the altar where as you should haue sayed, <hi>from whence she knoweth the holy sacrifice was dispensed or ministred,</hi> by which wordes it is manifest that the communion was daily receiued not of the priest alone, but of all them that were present. You are as bolde as one of your wisedome may be with such a man, to will <hi>M. Grindall</hi> to looke in his grammer for <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustins</hi> figures, but if I may be so bolde with so profound a clearke as you are, I woulde desire you to looke in the ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies of your grammer, whether <hi>sui,</hi> be, for her, and

                  <hi>vnde</hi> where. And if you can not proue these significations, by that parte of grammer which is called <hi>Etymologie,</hi> that you would defende them by that part of cunning where in you are better learned, called <hi>Pseudologia</hi>: but to the matter of this testimony, <hi>we haue in this first remembraunce of her,</hi> in the nexte <hi>we haue the sacrifice of our price offered for her.</hi> In deede this soundeth more like the matter you would haue: if <hi>S. Augustine</hi> had not before in plaine wordes expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his meaning, which is nothing else, but that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was celebrated, in ministration of which there was speciall remembraunce of her in the prayers, as there was of all deade in the sayth a generall memory. And if you aske me what figure <hi>S. Augustine</hi> vsed, though I coulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to diuerse figures, yet it may best be excused by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyrologia, which is an vnproper kind of speaking, to call that the sacrifice of our price, which was but a thankes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for the sacrifice of our price, which Christ onely offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red once for all vpon the aultar of the crosse. As <hi>Augustine</hi> him selfe when he speaketh properly will confesse. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two places proue nothing but prayer for the deade vsed by <hi>Augustine.</hi> But that you may see all this was but su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition or will worship in him: he him selfe in a maner confesseth as much in the same place, where he prayeth most earnestly <hi>lib.

His meaning is to allude to the free will offerings of the lawe, but in deede he declareth that he prayed not according to the rule appoynted by God, but according to the corrupt motion of his owne minde. As for the place of <hi>Possidonius</hi> proueth plainly, that it was the sacrifice of thankes giuing that was offered for the commendation of the godly and quiet deposition or putting of, of his body, which he before describeth. In steed of which <hi>M. Allen</hi> translateth, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his rest as though he had bene out of rest, &amp; sayth, that not withstanding his holy life and godly depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet euen that day the citie was taken, had oblation for
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:2890:227"/>
his rest, But if the men of those dayes had bene of <hi>M. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens</hi> opinion concerning purgatory, they would not both haue compted <hi>Augustine</hi> for a perfect man, and yet after his death to doubt of his rest. Finally, where he boasteth, that none were saued in those dayes, but in this fayth, he followeth his owne vayne of lying, and not any proofe of auncient writing. For although they were in that tyme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with some errours, and that not so great as he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them withall: yet was the fayth of their saluation in the onely foundation Iesus Christ, and not in merittes or Masses, pardons or pilgrimage, but in the onely mercy of God. <hi>Tota spes mea</hi> (sayth <hi>Augustine) non nisi magna valdè misericordia tua.

For if that were not true which at our first conuersion was preached vnto vs, then we receiued not the faith, but falsehoode at their handes: then the histories doe make a lowde lye, in testifying we were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Christian faith both at that time and by such men, then it were no conuersion from heathen Idolatrie to the worship of Christ, but it were a chaunge from one superstition to an other: and this latter so much worse then the other, because vnder the name of Christ there were practise perpetuall of execrable sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, in instituting of a sacrifice to the defasing of our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, in adoring bare breade as the hoste of our saluation, in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it vp to God for the sinnes both of the quicke and deade,

Then haue all that euer ranne the rase of that faith and doctrine, till this daye, which they taught, perished with them: then are they founde false witnesses, whome we haue accompted as our vndoubted, true and lawfull pastors: then God hath purposely deceiued vs with fayned miracles full many, with numbers of vaine visions, then all our labour is lost till this day. The holynesse of so many good princies and priestes is praised in vaine, the bloude of Martyrs shed in vaine, the exercise of all sacraments in vaine: and because all deuotion consisted in our fathers dayes in the earnest zele of so false a religion, as they thinke this to be, then the more deuotion the farther from Christ, the lesse religion, more neere to saluation: then happy was he that was the worst, and cursed was he that was counted the best: then is our case most carefull, then are we worse then all other nations, that neuer receiued the name of Christ: then are we worse then we were before our conuersion, then (to be shorte) there is no religion, no Christ, no God, no hope of saluation.</p>

For though prayer for the deade, and other superstitious opinions then receiued, were false, yet doth it not follow, that all that then was taught them for Christianity was false.

In the last chapter, we shoulde haue had prayer and sacrifice for the deade, with the conuersion of all nations, but a lacke we coulde not obteine so much, as the same altogether in one poore nation of the Saxons, and them (as some thinke) not so much conuerted from Gentility to Christ, as peruerted from pure Christianity to superstition.

And as concerning the diuerse formes of Liturgies, which you saye doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and wholy agree with your masse, as they be corrupt, and falsely beare the name of them to whome they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, so notwithstanding, being of some antiquity, they differ almost as much from your masse, as your masse dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from our forme of celebration of the communion. But to follow you at the heeles, as farre as you dare goe: I will agree with <hi>S. Augustins</hi> rule, that the lawe of beleuing, shoulde make a lawe of praying, but faith if it be true, hath no other grounde but the worde of God, therefore prayer if it procede of true faith, hath no other rule to frame it by, but the worde of God. And though <hi>Augustine</hi> proue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> which allowed the prayer of the Church, that the Church woulde not so praye, except she did so beleue, yet it followeth not, neither doth he meane to defend, that what so euer the visible Church receiueth is true, if it be not agreable to the worde of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other perswasions set a side, he prouoketh onely to the scripture, to trye the faith and doctrine of the Church. Which rule if he had as diligently followed, in examininge the common error of his time, of prayer for the deade at that time, as he did in beating downe the schisme of the Donatistes, or the heresie of the Pelagians, he woulde not so blindly haue defended, that which by holy Scripture he was not able to mainteine, as he doth in that booke <hi>de cura pro mortuis agenda</hi> and else where. And where as you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our Church to a steppe dame, and your Synagoge to a naturall mother, we maye more iustly wringe backe that comparison vpon your noses. For our Church herein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth her selfe to be a naturall mother, that she neither keepeth backe from her true children that heauenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce, which their father hath appointed them, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth the eternall abdication of them that be obstinate

But your malignant church, sheweth her selfe to be a cursed steppe dame, both in feeding the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with a vaine hope of release of paines after this life, and in tormenting the well disposed with a false feare of paines which God hath released, to al them that truely turne vnto him. So her terror tormenteth the vertous, deceiueth the wicked, her hope flattereth the vngodly and disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the well affected.

VVhich no doubt Christ instituted at his last supper, which the holy Ghost afterward secretly suggested to the Apostles, which they againe faithfully deliuered to the nations conuerted by their preaching, and to diuerse of their owne disciples: by whom the same was deriued downe to our dayes, taught in all nations, and carefully practised of all people. VVhereof we haue worthy witnesses for all countries almost. For so the godly doctors <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, Cyprian, Augustine,</hi> both taught and worshipped in Africke, the same doth <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Damascene</hi> in Syria, <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Athanasius</hi> in Egypte. <hi>Denyse</hi> the auncient, and <hi>Bernarde</hi> in Fraunce, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in Thrase, <hi>Basill</hi> and his brethern in Cappadocia, <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the greate in Italy, <hi>Augustine</hi> our apostle and <hi>Bede</hi> in our countrie of England: with the rest of all nations baptized, whome I named before, and might doe yet a number: what shoulde I say a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre? all that euer were counted Catholikes since the beginning, were of the same sense in that cause. And to name the residue where these do not serue, it were lost labour. For whome they can not moue, I can not tell what maye perswade him in any matter. Or if he dare not bestow his credit on these mens doinges, whome maye he salfely trust? If the communion and faithfull fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, of so many godly and gracious men so vniformely consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both in the teaching and practising of this matter, can not sattell and quiet a mans conscience, who can appeace his disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnsteadfast minde and cogitation? If in the construing of Gods word and scriptures, so many of such graue iudgement, of so approued wisedome, of so passing learning, of such earnest stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in tryall of the trueth, of so vertuous a life, of so heauenly a gifte and grace in the expounding of Gods worde, maye not be salfely followed in this our search, whome shoulde we follow, or to whome shoulde the simple addicte them selues, in so greate a turmoyle of learned men: one sorte craking so fast of scripture, and the other sorte, when the matter commes to triall, alleaging

Now touching the credit and worthynesse of these, whom he so highly extolleth, as I woulde not goe about to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish it, if they were to be compared with vs, so when they are opposed against the manifest worde of God and the credit of the holy Apostles, the instruments of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, there is no cause that we shoulde be caried awaye with them. But the controuersie is not (as <hi>M. Allen</hi> sayth) of the authoritie of the scriptures in this matter, but of the true meaning of them, which it is more like, that they being such men, then we so farre inferior to them, should knowe, I aunswere, they them selues for the most parte confesse, that prayer and oblation for the deade, is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at all out of the scriptures, as <hi>Tertullian, Augustine</hi> and other, the rest that woulde seeke confirmation in the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and such like, doe so manifestly wrest them to their purpose, that the Papistes them selues are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to vse those textes of scripture for their proofes. And as for such places, as the later Papistes woulde vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently draw vnto their error, they haue fewe or none of the olde approued writers which though they allow their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror yet that so interpret them, as the place. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And what a shamelesse creature is <hi>M. Allen,</hi> to say the controuersie is about the true meaning of the scripture, when he him selfe in the next leafe before, affirmeth that prayer and sacrifice for the deade, was instituted by Christ at his last Supper, which the holy Ghost afterwarde did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly suggest vnto the Apostles, and they as secretly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to the nations. For, no worde nor halfe worde therof is conteined in their writings, which are to vs the only true testimony of their tradition. Thus haue these heretikes no grounde of their heresie, but shifte from the worde of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to secret tradition, from tradition to the meaning of scripture, from the plaine meaning of scripture, to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant opinions of men, from the variable and contrary
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:2890:245"/>
opinions of men in times past, to their owne obstinacy and continuaunce in error in time present &amp; yet he woundreth, that we are so blinde, that we can not see the cleere light of the trueth. If Satan transforming him selfe into an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light, hath so dasled their eyes, that they can not see the true light, they are iustly plagued, because they haue refused the faithfull testimony of Gods worde, which only geueth true light vnto the eyes (as the Prophet saith) and geuen heede to spirites of errors and doctrines of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, by whom they are blinded in vtter darkenesse, though it be with false imagination and dreaminge of light. Yet see the confidence of the man, he is suer, that if we were examined of our conscience, what triall of this doubt we woulde wishe, there is none we coulde name, but his cause might well abide it. Why <hi>M. Allen,</hi> we haue testified of our conscience longe agoe, that the onely authority of Gods worde written, shall satisfie vs, as well in this as in all other matters, if you were as desirous to satisfie vs, as you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and as able to performe, as you are to promise, we should haue hearde before this time some sentence of scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to maintaine, prayer and sacrifice for the deade, not standing vppon voluntary collection, but either in plaine wordes or necessary conclusion. For there is nothing that we are bounde to knowe, nothing that we are bounde to doe, but either in expresse wordes or in necessary colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is as good as expresse wordes, it is set forth in the holy Scriptures. Beside this, you shoulde bring a great preiudice against vs, if you coulde bringe the consent and practise of the primitiue pure Church for the space of an hundreth yeares after Christ. But neither of these doe we looke to see, we before see with our eyes the certainety of those thinges, whereof now we contend in words and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges.</p>

But being assured of this as a grounde, that the prayer of the Priest in the whole Churches name at the altar, can not but beare singular strength and trueth, it is necessarily concluded, that seeing the publike minister so prayeth, that we must needes beleue, that God hath mans hearte in his hande, and may turne it to the belefe of his worde, or loue of his will, as he liketh and listeth: notwithstanding the perfect freedome of mans will, which by Gods grace is neuer perished, but alwayes perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.

I take to be a like disease in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth that it is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wombe, he gusheth out nothing but bragging, and faceing, scolding, and sclaundering, tauntinge and trifling. And therefore I will but breefely confute his vanity and turne him to his matches to contend in that kind of quarreling. The chiefe argument (he sayeth) that the Church in times past and <hi>Augustine</hi> the Churches champion, vsed against the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> was to shewe that their heresie was contrary to the publicke prayers of the Church: what shoulde I vse many wordes? I appeale to the iudgement of all Papistes, that haue not loste all vse of naturall reason, and indifferent iudgement, which either haue reade, or will take paines to reade, so many workes as <hi>Augustine</hi> did write against the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians,</hi> whether of an hundreth arguments, that he vseth, this insultation be not one of the feeblest: which tooke no holde of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> by force of trueth that is in it, but by their owne concession and graunt, of that prayer to be godly and them to be of the Church that so prayed. But now the controuersie is not onely of the substance of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but of the Church it selfe also. And therefore when <hi>Augustine</hi> had to doe with the <hi>Donatistes</hi> that challenged the Church vnto them selues, he setteth all other tryalles aside, and prouoketh onely to the scriptures. Therefore <hi>(M. Allen)</hi> if you wil teach your schollers to kepe vs at the baye as heretikes, you must not teach them to barke and baule, nothing but the Church the Church, like tinckers curres, but you must instructe them to open conningly out of the scriptures how our doctrine is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the trueth, and yours agreable to the same. I do not blame you if you would faine haue that argument of the Church, without tryall which is the Church, to take place, for it woulde ease you and your fellowes of much paine, it woulde serue you both for a sworde and a buckler, all other bookes, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and reasons, might be layed a side and keepe silence. The Church sayth it, and we are the Church, therefore it is true. The scriptures them selues are altogether neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, where this argument may stand for payment. This is so plaine a proofe, that the aduersaries <hi>shall not be able to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:2890:247"/>
saye baffe vnto it.</hi> In deede they were but sory whelpes that could not say baffe to the bleating of such a calfe as you are, which thinke that such a foolish cauill, can carry credit with them that haue any cromme of brayne in their heads. The Church prayeth so, therefore it is true. Nay Syr, you pray, and practise to controle the word of God, therefore you are not the Church of God. Proue that you doe not so, or else prate as long as you wil. And thinke not to dorre vs with <hi>Cyprians</hi> name, where as if you had his iudgement, we might be bold to say as the same <hi>Augustine</hi> hath giuen vs example: <hi>Nos nullam Cypriano facimus iniuriam, cum eius quaslibet literas, à canonica diuinarum scripturarum auctoritate distinguimus.

And it is easie to be gathered by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that the olde forme of liturgie was, but to make mention of the deade, to haue them in remembraunce. And because they vsed to make memory of all sortes of men that were deade in Christ, he expoundeth it according to the errour of his time, that this memory was a prayer for the sinners, for the iust, as Patriarkes, Prophets, &amp;c. a signification that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to Christ. A simple cause why they should be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, but this shift he is driuen vnto, because he did not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the memory and oblation which the olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made for all departed in Christ, was a sacrifice of thankes giuing and not of prayers for them. The same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; errour doe all the later liturgies follow, making me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory &amp; prayers for all them that are departed in the faith. In the memory of all departed they follow the olde order, in praying for all, they follow the latter error, which had chaunged the sacrifice of thankes giuing into the sacrifice of prayer. But herein they declared, that they had not yet generally receiued your newe doctrine of purgatory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they prayed not as you doe, for them onely that are in purgatory, to whom onely you confesse the prayers to be needefull and profitable, but for all that are departed in the fayth of Christ from the beginning of the worlde.

If I may be as bolde to gesse as you: I gesse that he which made that lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty chalenge of the Papist against the Protestant, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to recant at the ende of euery article, if he colde be aunswered, was such a tryed <hi>Thraso</hi> as <hi>M.

But who so euer he was, was he ashamed of his name because he set not his name vnto it? and was the man of <hi>Chester</hi> ashamed of his name because he setteth it not to his treatise? Finally be all those Papistes ashamed of their names, which haue written so many petty pamphlettes to be caried abrode in Popish fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes pocketts? O intemperate tonge, which can not spare such tauntes, as redounde to him selfe and his owne good maisters reproch. Your lyes of offering, worshipping, and praying to the hoste be reproued alredy, you say we might with more honesty haue coped for one of those Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, if we liked not <hi>Gregories</hi> Masse, rather then to haue forged a new.

And where as you prate of the Latine Church and the East parte, we neither refuse the Latine Church while it was pure, nor receiue the East Church where in it was corrupt, but the scripture is a rule vnto vs to iudge all Churches by. Although it were easy to proue by that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie, which the Britaynes and the Scottes had against the Saxons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the celebration of Easter, that our countrie first recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their conuersion from the East Church, whose cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie they did then defend, euen as the East Church did

If they saye yea: desire them to aunswere first to all these places, so euidently confirming our purpose, that they can not abide any cloude or couer of mans sutteltye, for their shifting to any forged sense. If they can not, yet let them alleage some place of any auncient writer them selues, which do expressely denye purgatory or prayers for the deade: as we for the confirming therof haue done in plaine termes with out crafte or colour many. If they be not able to do so much, yet go further with them: aske them whether they haue any expresse wordes in scripture that denie prayers to be profitable for the deade, not by a fonde gesse of their owne heades, corrupt consciences, or preiudicate mindes, expounded to that purpose, but I say by expresse words: or at least
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:2890:253"/>
(which is liberty enough) expounded for that meaning by any one man of all the antiquitie.

I woulde not put them to the paines to make discourse throughout all ages, churches, times, and doctors, as we haue done: but onely let them to kepe their credit and scholars, and to saue their honesties, bring but one or two of all that euer wrote in the compasse of Gods Church, and thou maiest with lesse daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and better reason, follow their doctrine. But there is no one such place, I assure the good reader, neither in scripture, doctor, nor councell, nor countrie, nor age sith the worlde beganne.

that is more, he will teach vs what to aunswere also, but sauing his wisedome, he must geue vs leaue to aunswere for our selues. First if we be asked howe we can shifte our selues against the generall practise of Gods Church, for all popish assertions, and namely this of praying for the deade: we aunswere, that we deny the practise to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, because we finde it not in the holy Scriptures, nor in the most auncient writers, that lyued with in an hundreth yeares and more after the time of Christ. And to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler practise of the later times, we aunswere, that it is not sufficient to controll the auncient doctrine, and primer practise. If we be required to shew some place of any aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writer, which denyeth purgatory or prayers for the deade, we haue already shewed that <hi>Augustine</hi> some time doth doubt whether there be purgatory, some time affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth there is no meane or thirde place, but heauen for the elect, and hell for the reprobate, likewise for praying or satisfying for the deade, we haue alleaged <hi>Cyprian</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: your owne common law, out of <hi>Hieronym,</hi> sayth, that the prayers of the liuing profit not the deade. 13. <hi>quaest.</hi> 2. <hi>In praesenti saeculo &amp;c.</hi> In this present worlde, we knowe that one of vs may be helped of an other, either by prayers or by counsells, but when we shoulde come before the iudgement seate of Christ, neither <hi>Iob</hi> nor <hi>Daniel</hi> nor <hi>Noe,</hi> can intreate for any man, but euery man must beare his owne burthen. Yea <hi>Gelasius</hi> the Pope sayth, that no man can be absolued of the Pope after his death 24. <hi>q.</hi> 2. <hi>C. lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Wherefore serue the Popes pardons then? To that which is required of the expresse word of God, forbidding prayers for the deade, we aunswere, that all places of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that forbidde prayers without fayth, forbidde prayer for the deade, for faith is not euery mans vaine perswasion, but an assurance out of the worde of God, which because we can not haue in praying for the dead, therefore we are forbidden to praye for them. If it be against the hope of Christians to morne for the deade, much more it is against the fayth and hope of Christians to praye for them. For by our prayer we suppose them to be in misery whome the

And where as he sayeth we chalenge the olde doctors before the simple, for our partakers, whether they be simple or wise before whom we speake, as we speake not alwayes before the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple onely, but often times and commonly before as wise and well learned men as <hi>M. Allen,</hi> we neuer make any such challenge of them as the Papistes doe, which offer to stand to their iudgement in all thinges, and yet in most thinges yea in the cheefest pointes of religion, that be so in deede, or be so compted of them, they are contrary to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and olde councells, for which cause, and not for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of trueth, we alleage the authoritie of men, for we haue learned, as <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, to geue this honor, only to the canonicall scriptures, that we must beleue them with out controuersie, and all other writings we receiue so farre as they agree with the scriptures and not other wise, wherefore we doe not onely saye that the doctors haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like men, but we haue proued it, so that the Papistes them selues can not saye naye for shame. But to that he sayth, we doe boldely condemne the holy Scriptures, that it out of all measure impudent, and sclaunderous. And that which he citeth out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> belike as he had it of some foolish priest, that fedde him with notes of doctors, or as he is impudent enough, to peruerte the fathers meaning, him selfe, so if he had alleged the whole sentence he might well haue taken him selfe, and the rest of his fellowes by the noses, for heretikes, by the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> whose wordes be these. <hi>Cum enim ex scripturis arguantur, in accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem conuertuntur ipsarum scripturarum, quasi non rectè ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Finally whereas you say, that our aunswere is contrary to it selfe, you seeke a knot in a rush. For all may be true. First the deuill sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted superstitious deuotion into the Gentiles, by peruerse emulation of whom, <hi>Iudas</hi> might be deceiued, and his fact giue occasion to the ignorant people of errour, and their ignorance first winked at, because it had a shew of pietie, confirmed by custome, might at length be allowed of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> and others who neuer weighed the matter by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, but by the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> practise. And this I thinke is the right degree of prayers for the deade and purgatory.</p>

All those that haue any skill in the antiquitie, will beare me recorde, that the pastors did neuer holde their peace when any wolfe did but once open his mouth against the sheepe.

followe, that the doctrine of purgatory and oblation for the departed with still consent of all nations receiued in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, had no beginning after the first institution of our faith and worship of God, but hath ioyned from the first grounde of our Christian institution in Christes faith, with that sacrifice and due honour of God which the Apostles by the suggestion of the holy Ghost planted in all nations with the same faith. Thus I make my argument:<note place="margin">

Of so many heresies as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in his time, it were hard to require and vnpossible to shew, who preached against euery one of them, at their first entrance, &amp; yet they be damnable heresies. In <hi>S.

Who prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched against this error, except perhaps the Pelagians that were horrible heretikes? Was all the Church corrupted with it in one day? If euery heresie had bene beaten down as fast as it sprang, Antichrist should neuer haue set vp his throne in the temple of God. If God had not sent into the

There is the brande marke of Romish reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that all the water in Tiberis nor in the Ocean sea, shal not be able to wash out. Must we finde out the authors of your heresies? Nay iustifie them your selues by the worde of God if you can. And because you bring in a witty exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the common wealth, I will aunswere you with the like. Must the Magistrate either iustifie a theefes possession, or else bring out the author where he had it? Nay the theefe must bring out good proofe, howe and by whom he came by such goods, or else he is worthy to be serued like such a one. So shall you not compell vs to tell you, where, when, or how your heresie came in, seeing it is sufficient for vs to shew, that it came not from God, nor by the Apostles, nor through their doctrine. But you doe well to conclude your reason in a syllogisme, for then by the weakenes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth appeare your <hi>maior</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> be both false, or at the least wise vnable to be proued of you. For euery falshod hath not bene preached against, at the first entry.

oblations for the dead, but what kind of oblations, it is not yet agreed vppon, but such they were, as were offered for mens birthes, for they be ioyned togither. <hi>Oblationes pro defunctis, pro natalitijs, annua die facimus,</hi> we make oblations yearely for the day of mens death, and the day of mens birth. Now it is not like, they offered prayers but tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for mens birth, and euen so for their death. For those places, out of the other bookes, where he speaketh of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for mens spirites, I will consider afterward. But in this booke <hi>de corona militis,</hi> if oblations were prayers, which he saith came from the Apostles, he vtterly denyeth that they came from the Scriptures. Therefore by <hi>Tertullians</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you doe abuse the Scriptures, which woulde wrest them to proue out of them that which he sayth can not be proued by them. But think you, prayers for the dead came from the Apostles, because he sayth so? If you aunswere yea, then must you likewise thinke, that it is a wicked thing to fast on Sonday, or to pray on your knees, for in the same place, he sayth that these opinions came also from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. If you aunswere, he sayth vntruely of these, so doe we answere of the other. Now come backe of your 13. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeares, to seeke your apostolike tradition where you can finde it. All is not Gospell that <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath sayd.

But it is because you haue store enough beside. Howbeit if the most auncient fayle you, it is not for the later sorte to helpe you. If <hi>Tertullian</hi> had no ground of his saying, when he affirmed that oblations for the deade came from the Apostles, what ground can <hi>Augustine</hi> haue which was 200. yeares farther from the Apostles time then he? But where you charge vs to confesse, that the Church in <hi>Augustines</hi> time was holy, Catholike, and Apostolike, you must witte, if you will, that although we may so confesse, in respect of the substance of true doctrine, which then was taught, yet we doe not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by iustifie euery error &amp; superstition of that age.

                  <p>It may seeme by his wordes, that when by occasion of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or otherwise any person was vnburied, yet there was made some hearse or monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t where his freinds lighted tapers, as they doe at this daye, and procured the holy Masse, which <hi>Athanasius</hi> calleth the Vnbloudy hoste or sacrifice,<note place="margin">

And such as mislike their doctrine, and knowe of their owne conscience that they be directly against them, yet dare not openly charge them with falshood, as they doe vs their scholars, but rather (as I sayd) seeke some sentence out of them to helpe their owne cause, then with their plaine condemnation of falshood to refuse their authoritie. <hi>S.

So did the Valentinians, although their heresie were newe, when they were confuted by the Scriptures, shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them selues vnder the name of traditions, as we haue shewed before, out of <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 2. And therfore it is but vayne bragging, that you promise to seeke out any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fathers of our perswasion, then the Apostles of Christ, by whose holy writings, we neuer refuse to be iudged. what if any heretike haue affirmed some thing, that is true? is truth worse in an heretikes mouth? The deuills them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues confessed Christ. Their confession was true, their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was refused. So if any heretike haue confessed the truth, we may receiue the truth and yet reiect his testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For truth hath testimony of God his word and whether it be affirmed or denyed by the deuill, it is all one. The high way that you prate of, is a bye way, for the Scripture is the onely high way to the truth, with the guidance of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.

And thus againe: who so euer was withstande in his first arising and preaching, by such as were in the vnitie of the Church, he was a false teacher, and his abettours be heretikes. And the force of this conclusion is so greate, that the heretikes them selues if they can get any likely shew of raysing of any doctrine, or practise of Gods Church in these latter dayes, they thinke they haue a good argument against the Catholikes. Therefore they woulde father transubstantiation vpon this Councell, the adoration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vpon that Pope, indulgencies vpon that byshop, &amp;c.

as we be with the Iacke strawes of Geneua. And yet when they haue traualed to their heartes ake, they can finde no one thing first inuented by any of them, whome they falsely name to be the authors thereof.

And therefore it is not otherwise to be thought, but that the Montanistes vpon the ground of this opinion, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the oblations for the deade which the Church then had by peruerse emulation of the Gentiles, and yet were but oblations of thankes giuing, as they could be no other for the birth dayes, they added also prayers for the spirites of them that, were deade, whereof <hi>Tertullian</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:2890:272"/>
mention in his bookes <hi>de castitate &amp; de Monogamia,</hi> which were both written to heretikes of his sect, and by those prayers laboreth to proue, that second mariages are not lawfull. Also in his booke <hi>de anima</hi> before named, though for an other purpose, he rehearseth a miracle of a woman whom he knew of his sect (for none other he cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Church) which after she was deade and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to buriall, by prayer of the Priestes, at the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his prayer, she tooke vp her handes from her sides, and held them vp as they that vse to pray, and when the office of buriall was ended, layd them downe agayne. This miracle I take to haue bene an illusion of Sathan, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that new opinion, that prayers profited the deade, as that also which he reporteth of heare say, of some of his sect, that when two bodies should be buried in one graue, the one lay further and made roome for the other: which was no doubt a sleight of Satan, to commend the vnitie of heretikes. And that the practise of the Church for oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the deade at the yearly day of their birth, were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Gentiles, it appeareth by this, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> counteth them of all one origen with the oblations <hi>pro na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitijs,</hi> that is for the birth dayes. which <hi>Beatus Rhenanus</hi> a Papist, and a great antiquary, doth confesse, affirming that by the canons of the Nicene councell and other councels, which he hath seene in libraries, those oblations <hi>pro natali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tijs</hi> with other superstitions, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> fathereth vpon tradition of the Apostles, were abrogated. And the oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons them selues, which were at burialls, mariages, &amp; birth dayes, he affirmeth were mony that was offered in almes, to the reliefe of the poore. <hi>Origen</hi> to much a Philosopher was not content with <hi>Plato</hi> his purification, but he must bring in <hi>Platoes</hi> fire also, and that he would build as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes doe, and as he had better reason then the Papistes haue, out of the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. but because the Apostle sayd, that euery mans worke, should be tryed by fire, he thought that all men should passe through his purgatory, &amp; at length be saued. Afterward when prayers for the deade were growne out of memoryes for the deade, which were without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:2890:272"/>
in <hi>Origens</hi> tyme, as appeareth in his wordes in <hi>Iob. lib.</hi> 3. but kept with almes to the poore and reioysing for their rest, about <hi>S. Augustines</hi> time, the name of purgatory was first inuented, by some mediatores and conciliatores of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigens</hi> error, with the erroneous practise of the church. And this was a great corruption of those auncient tymes, that they did not alwaies weigh what was most agreeable to the word of God, but if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentiles or heretikes had any thing that semed to haue a shew of pietie, or charitie, they would draw it into vse, with such correction as they thought was sufficient. So they tooke the signe of the crosse from the Valentinians, oblations for the dayes of death and birth of the Gentiles, prescript tymes of fasting and vnmeasurable extolling of sole life, in the ministers of the Church, from the Maniches, Tacianistes, and Montanistes: prayer for the deade of the Montanistes: purgatory fire of the Origine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, yea <hi>Ieronym</hi> was almost fallen into the heresie of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in condemning second mariages: yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of sacrifice which was commonly vsed for the celebration of the Lordes supper, they tooke vp of the Gentiles. Finally it appeareth that the faithfull in <hi>Tertullians</hi> tyme, which were not of his sect, beleued not that the soules of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans departed, came into his hell or lower partes, where he maketh so many mansions, but that they were placed in heauen where Christ is, against whom he reasoneth after his brawling and taunting maner, that he vseth against the Catholikes <hi>libro de anima, cap. de inferis.</hi> And they that so beleue, allow no prayers for the deade. Wherefore it is left that <hi>Montanus</hi> and his followers were the first that taught prayers for the deade to be profitable, because that the soules of the faithfull that were not made perfect by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom or other streight penance, must pay the vttermost farthing in prison, and suffer the least offences in the lower partes, if they were not holpen with prayers. Therfore <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> was not the first that helde our opinion but <hi>Montanus</hi> before him was the first that held your opinion throughly, against the Catholikes of his tyme.

And as for the authority of Councels that is alleaged against vs, we haue shewed before, that the decrees of 95. Can. of Car. the forth and second of Vase are flatly falsified, which speake not at all of oblations for the deade, but oblations of the deade, that is, such mony as the departed haue bequethed to the vse of the poore. The 79. Can. of the forth Councell of Carthage decreed, that if penitents dyed before absolution, they shoulde haue their memory commended with prayers and oblations. The Bracarense decree Can. 39. prescribeth how the mony offered at such commemoration of the deade, shoulde be distributed. The 34. Can. of the same Councell, wherevnto he pointeth vs in this place, decreeth that for them that kill them selues, no commemoration shoulde be made nor that they shoulde be buried with Psalmes. But wherefore trowe you did he omit the next Canon to it? which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth that neither the commemoration of the holy obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor the office of singing Psalmes, should be bestowed vpon them that were cathechised and dyed before they were baptised. Either he sawe not the booke him selfe, or else he misliked that phrase, the commemoration of the holy oblation, wherby the Bishoppes of that Councell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, what they meane, when they named the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to be a sacrifice. That is, they did not take it to be so properly, but onely a commemoration of the holy sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ. As also when we reade in the olde writers or councells, oblation for the deade, we must not alwayes vnderstand the celebration of the communion as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pastes imagine, but that monye which first was offered for almes, and afterwards superstitiously was taken to be a kind of redemption for their sinnes. As in the 11. Councell of
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:2890:276"/>
Toledo. cap. 12. is declared where they decree of such pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, as dyed before reconciliation: <hi>Placuit nobis, vt &amp; memoria talium in eccles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This office that was bestowed vppon the deade, which so generally of the olde writers and councells is called a memorye, vndoubtedly tooke the name of that which it first was. Namely nothing but a memory with thankes giuing, which after was corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to a prayer for them. Lykewise the oblation (as <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> testifieth) at the first was nothing but almes to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife of the poore, for ioy of the rest of them that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and for comfort and godly exercise of them that were a liue. But afterwarde it grew to be compted a redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption for the sinnes of the departed, and the name of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was drawen further to the celebration of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and to be compted a sacrifice for the quicke and the deade. But before this Councell, there was an other Synode helde in Spayne at Toledo, called Toletan. 3. cap. 21. Where it was decreed, that they which by Gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling departed out of this life, shoulde be ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Forbidding that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall song which was wonte to be song to the deade, and all other vnseemely gestures of morning. If you saye this doth not exclude prayers and oblations: they adde, that it must be thought sufficient for the buriall of Christian mens bodyes, that the office of singing of godly Psalmes is bestowed, in hope of the resurrection. And so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Canon they woulde haue men comforted by the hope of the resurrection, affirming that Christian mens bodyes throughout the worlde ought to be no otherwise buried. As for the decree of the Councell of Florence, is but a meere mockerie. For it was helde not past seuen score yeares a goe, when at the same time, there was an other Councell holden at Basill against it, in which the Pope <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> the fourth, who gathered that mocke Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As for the holy councel which was helde the other day at Trent, you did well to put in the margent, for it was not worthy to come in the texte. If the determination of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell be so holy, why do you Papistes daily breake a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of canons decreed therein, which conteins scarse a-shadow of reformation? But you can dispense with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells as you liste.

namely the Scripture and the true meaning thereof. Doubtfull, because it standeth vpon a likelyhoode and not vpon a certeinty. For thus you ioyne: whether the olde doctors be more like to vnderstand the Scriptures then the Protestants. I haue aunswered before, we wil make no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with them.

What then? shall we arrogate the spirite as proper to vs and deny it to them? God forbid. They had their measure of Gods spirite, &amp; (we humbly thanke his maiestie) so haue we. How then? is the spirite of God contrary to it selfe, because they and we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not in all thinges? God forbid. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> were both endued with Gods spirite, and both Martyres, yet they agreed not both in one interpretation nor iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the scripture. what then? there remaineth but this second principle as certaine as the first. That the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God hath a meaning in the scriptures, which is not to be sought out of the scriptures, in the opinions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuable men, but onely in the scriptures, where is nothing but the spirite of trueth. These 2. commaundements, serch the scriptures, and trie the spirites: teach how to attaine to certainety of trueth. For the scriptures are not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood but by the spirite, and the spirites are not tryed but by the scriptures. Therefore that the spirite maye declare his owne meaning, one place of scripture must be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by an other. All other ordinary meanes and healpes, of wit, learning, knowledge of tongues, dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in hearing, reading, and praying, are subordinate and seruing to this search and tryall. And who so obserueth this serch and tryall most precisely, shall come to the knowledge of the trueth most certainely. And who so euer is negligent in this search and tryall, though he haue otherwise neuer so many and excellent graces, and giftes, may easely be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, yea euen when he thinketh he followeth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

of the scriptures. I coulde alleage for confirmation of this truth, the testimony of diuers of the auncient fathers, which if they had alwayes followed that which some times they so highly commended, they should not so lightly haue passed ouer some thinges, and other thinges so slenderly haue mainteined. But my thinkes, the testimony of the Pope shoulde be <hi>a per se</hi> with all Papistes. The Pope him selfe in his canon lawe (for <hi>Cayphas</hi> some times doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy) hath allowed this to be the onely waye to expound the scriptures. <hi>Affirming</hi> that no where else, but <hi>euen</hi> out of the scriptures themselues, the true sense of the scriptures is to be taken.

It should seeme <hi>M.

But who can prescribe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill a measure in lying? when he is disposed to lye? we haue no scriptures at all, the Catholikes haue all the scriptures, and the iudgement of the whole worlde vppon them: you haue sayd enough, <hi>M.

But as in this secret of God, no man without iuste reprehension maye deeply wade, so it maye reasonably be gathered that the fall of the tree before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, can not induce with any probability, the necessity of the soules abiding in all respects, where it first light. Mary we freely graunt with diuers of the auncient fathers, that the fall of the tree into the Southe parte, maye signifie vnto vs the departure of man in the happy state of grace, and the Northe side likewise, the cursed and damnable state of the wicked: and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That is to saye, if he passe this worlde an electe person, in the loue and grace of God, he is out of doubt of all damnation, or rather out of possibilitie to be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: and so the case of the forsaken is vtterly remedilesse.

I can not tell how it falleth, but yet so it doth, that your doctrine and arguments minister ouer much occasion of errour, and that to the deceiued in the depest matters of our faith.

Your first aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is, that the soules of men at that time continued not where they at the first fell, but went first into the inferior partes, which you call <hi>Lymbus patrum,</hi> but neither <hi>Ezechias</hi> nor the Gospell, knew any such place. For <hi>Ezechias</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the graue, the Gospell of that place of comfort, where the soules of the faithfull are in happy estate, euen where Christ is.

If that be so, why doe we not say that Christ descended into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome or into <hi>Lymbus patru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or seeing Christ sayd he would be in Paradise, why say we not that he descended into paradise, and seeing he commended his spirite into the hands of his father, why say we not he descended into his fathers handes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these be no absurdities that follow of <hi>M. Allen,</hi> &amp; that papisticall assertion, you shall heare <hi>Caluins</hi> absurd doctrine, refuted by the sayd famous Clerke <hi>M. Allen</hi> with famous reasons. He will aske (for his aunsweres be questions) what is it to be thought, of those that were raysed from death to life, seeing they receiued their first fall. This were a pretty question for a Sophister in Oxeford to demaund in their parleis. But the poore man tormenteth him selfe in vayne, they which deny prayers to be profitable by that place of the wise man, vnderstand the fall of the tree to the South or to the North, to be the iudgement of God concerning
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:2890:284"/>
euery man, either of reward or of punishment, which can not be altered after a mans death. This restreyneth not God from working miracles, and sending some to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but sheweth what the ordinary state of men is after their departure. This place is of them that dye &amp; remaine in death, vnto the day of the generall resurrection, as for the other, although they were dead, yet they were appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to liue againe, they fell in deede, but to haue a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar rising, but when they fell to abyde the generall rising, they were in the same case with the rest. But examples will make the matter cleare. The soule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was 4. dayes from his body, <hi>M. Allen</hi> thinketh he was not in heauen, for Christ loued him too well to bring him out of heauen: and not that onely, but to reduce him to the vncerteyne state of this life. As though it were iniury to <hi>Lazarus</hi> to forbeare the ioyes of heauen, for the short tyme of this life, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come such a glorious example, of the maiestie of Christes power, and as though Christ, which brought him to lyfe temporal, was not able in the incerteinty of this life, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue him to eternall life. O prophane heathenish Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, of Gods high mysteries. But seeing you thinke <hi>M. Allen</hi> he was not in heauen, where thinke you in your conscience he was? in hell, or in purgatory, or in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome? for you haue store of diuerse places, if he were in hell, you hold there had bene no redemption. And it is not like that he whom Christ loued so well was 4. dayes in torment. If you say he was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, yet he was in comfort and certeinty of saluation, then by your owne reason, it is not like that Christ which loued him so well, would abase his happy condition to bring him to the state of this life which is miserable and as you say vncerteyne, yea he had bene better in purgatory: for you holde he shoulde haue bene in certainety of saluation, but so he was not when he returned to the vncerteine state of this life, the like may be saide of <hi>Tabitha.</hi> But these be foolish and vnlearned que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions <hi>M.

And yet when you haue questioned about them all you can, you shall neuer

proue the common case of the departed in Christ, by these fewe peculiar cases. For when so euer and how so euer it pleased God, that their soules remained, it was determined of God that they shoulde be restored to their bodies. And although there soules were in heauen and in happines, as I doe not doubt but they were, yet was it no iniurie nor hurt vnto them, to serue the glory of God. For I doubt not but as all the Godly in this life, confesse it to be a parte of angelicke felicitie, to be obediente to the will of God, so those that were so raised from death, so long as their seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d life continued, caried in their hartes, a heauenly fruition of the glory of God shining in their restitution: and of their thankefull obedience, submitting them selues to the will of God. But when these matters passeth the reache of <hi>M. Allens</hi> sophystrie, as of which he can prate much, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine nothing, he falleth to an other shifte: that the fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the southe, signifieth the certainty of saluation, that the elect be in, after this life, and the fall into the North, the certainty of damnation, that the wicked are in. For though the elect be in purgatory, yet they be in the fauour of God, and certaine of saluation. But this glosse corrupteth the texte, for then they should alwayes lye in purgatory, which is a warme south (if it be as they saye) for the certeinty or vncerteinty of their saluation, is as great before they were borne, as after they be deade. It can not be therefore that the wise man speaketh thereof. And because you cracke of the exposition of the fathers, <hi>Hieronym</hi> in his commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vpon this place, expoundeth the Northe and the Southe not for the states of grace or wrath, but for the places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde or punishment of them that die. <hi>Si dignos Austro fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus attulit in plaga iacebit Australi. Nec est aliquid lignum quod aut ad Aquilonem non sit aut ad Austrum.</hi> If it haue brought forth fructes worthy of the South, it shal lye in the Southe coste. Neither is there any tree but it falleth either to the North or to the South. As for your babling of the Saduces secte, and doubting of the resurrection, bidde your Popes and Cardinalls take heede of it.

So that this reste from labour, is no more but a happy ioye of conscience, with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie of saluation and peace in Christ Iesu. For which cause in the holy Canon of the Masse, it is saide, <hi>Christianos dormire in somno pacis, &amp; in Christo quiescere,</hi> That Christian folkes doe sleepe in the sleepe of peace, and rest in Christ, though for all that, in the same place, we aske <hi>Requiem &amp; refrigerium,</hi> reste and refreshing for them.

meaning of which you wrest and wrigle, like a snake, that is smitten on the head, but you can not auoyd the strife. First you vnderstand it onely of Martyres, that dye in the Lord, and call <hi>Augustine</hi> to witnesse thereof. As I will not deny but Martyrs are specially comforted by that voyce, so I wil affirme, that it is to the common comfort and rewarde of all the faythfull in Christ, who as they liue in Christ so they dye in Christ. And witnesse hereof I will not take of flesh and blood, but of the holy Ghost. <hi>Rom,</hi> 14. None of vs liueth vnto him selfe, neither doth any dye vnto him selfe, for whether we liue, we liue vnto the Lorde, and whether we dye, we dye vnto the Lorde. And the Apostle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. nameth the faithfull that are a sleepe in Christ, and 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. them that are deade in Christ. Wherefore in despite of the deuill and the Pope, this blessing apperteyneth to all them that dye in the Lord Iesus Christ, as true members of his body, and not to them onely that shedde their bloud for Christ. True it is, that all they that would liue godly in Christ Iesus, suffer persecution, but not all to the death, else who are those innumerable Saincts that no man can num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of all nations and tongues, which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> sawe, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 7. who are likewise in happy and blessed rest, without all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, lacke or hurt, hunger, thirst or heate? but when you are weary of that interpretation, you wring out an other: that they in purgatory also be happy, because they be sure of saluation at last, and the rest from labours, is either the rest from sinne, or else no more but ioy of conscience. wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this exposition is the canon of the Masse. The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the matter and he that vseth it, are all of like credit. But if I might pose your conscience <hi>M. Allen,</hi> can you call that a happy rest, which is ioyned with such torment &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, as you beare men in hand is in purgatory? Haue you forgotten that you sayd yere while of <hi>Tabitha</hi> and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> that it was a benefite for them to be deliuered out of purgatory into this life, and is it now a blessing to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched out of this life into purgatory? And as for that which you allege out of the canon of your masse, declareth that your masse was patched togither of many peeces of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:2890:287"/>
diuers colours. For you pray for the rest of them whome you confesse to be at rest in Christ: you wish easement for them whom you affirme to sleepe in peace.

               <p n="1">1 IT vexeth you at the very hart, that we require the authority of the holy Scriptures, to confirme your doctrine hauing a playne commaundement out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, that if any man teach otherwise then the word of God alloweth, he is to be accursed. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you runne to a childish kinde of Sophistry to say that our argument is negatiue. A perlous point that almost all the Papistes thinke them selues more then <hi>Chrisippus,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristoteles,</hi> when they tell vs that our argument is <hi>ab auctorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te negatiuè.</hi> Alacke poore logicke. All knowledge that chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men haue of heauenly thinges, is grounded vpon the authority of Gods word, therefore as it is no good logicke to conclude negatiuely of one place or booke of Scripture, this is not conteined in it, therefore it is not true: so of the whole doctrine of God, wherein all truth necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is conteyned, the argument is most inuincible that concludeth negatiuely thus. All true doctrine is taught in the Scripture, purgatory is not taught in the Scripture, therefore purgatory is no true doctrine. And this conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>M. Allen</hi> him selfe made of mans authoritie, <hi>cap.</hi> 13. pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory and prayers for the dead were not preached against, at their first entry, <hi>ergo</hi> they are true. But of all mens autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:2890:288"/>
it is false, wheras he sayth we are ouerthrowers &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyers, we confesse we are so, of all false doctrine and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie. For the word of God is appoynted not only to teach truth, but also to ouerthrow error, not onely to build faith but to destroy falshood. But it is a proper co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit wherin he pleaseth him self, as other of his sect do, to tel vs that all our faith standeth vpon negatiues. I could frame the Papists as holsome a creede all vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirmatiues if they wil receiue it. This is more then boyish babling. All trueth is to be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, all falshood to be denyed. Therefore it is not to be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what is affirmatiue and what negatiue, but what is true or false that is affirmed or denyed. But to runne through the articles of that creede, which he hath framed for vs, we truely beleue that man after his fall hath not free will, no not aptnes of will, to thinke any thing that is good. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. we beleue truely, that a man is not iustified by workes, but by faith onely. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. And yet we beleue that good workes are necessary to be in euery man that is iustified. <hi>Iac.</hi> 2. we beleue that the Church is not alwayes knowne to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon earth, neither the vniuersall Church seene at all of men, because it is in heauen, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. we beleue that the catholicke Church hath no chiefe gouerner vppon earth but Christ vnto whom all power is giuen in heauen &amp; earth <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. we beleue there are but 2. Sacraments of the new testament, baptisme and the Lordes supper instituted by Christ, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. we beleue that they geue not grace of the worke wrought but after the faith of the receiuer, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the election of God. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Baptisme is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for all Christians to receiue, that are not by necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie excluded from it. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. Christ is present at his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but not after a grosse and caparnaiticall maner, but as he was present in Manna to the fathers. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. There is no sacrifice propitiatory for our sinnes, but onely the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christes death once offered for all. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. There is no priesthood to offer sacrifice propitiatory but only the priesthood of Christ according to the order of <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech Heb.</hi> 7. The spirituall priesthood is common to all Christian men and women. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. we haue an altar of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:2890:288"/>
which it is not lawfull for them to eate, which serue the tabernacle, and other beside we haue none. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. we call not vpon Sainctes, because we beleue not in them, for how shoulde we call vpon them, in whome we beleue not? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. There is no prayer for the deade nor purgatory after this life, because they that liue vnto Christ dye vnto him and being dissolued are with him. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 17. Christ descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into hell to redeeme vs out of hell, by suffering the wrath of God for our sinnes <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. There is no Lymbus, for the fathers were at rest with God, where they are now: whether we call the place <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, or paradise, or heauen <hi>Luke.</hi> 16. and 23. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. The rest which you adde, maye be the beginning of the Popish creede, which you maye as you list continue negatiuely or affirmatiuely after this maner. God a lone knoweth not the heartes of all men. God onely is not to be worshipped and serued, for Sainctes haue both the one and the other. God onely is not true, for the Pope can not erre. Christ is not our onely mediator and aduocate, for Marie and the Sainctes are also. Christes death is not a sufficient redemption for vs, for we must satisfie for our selues. Christes death hath not taken away both our sinnes and the punishment of them, but the Popes padon maye. Christ is not onely our high priest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> for euery hedge priest is of the same order. Christ hath not made them that are sanctified perfect by a sacrifice once offered for all. For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greatest part is lefte to the masse. Our sinnes are not freely forgeuen vs by Christ, for we must satisfie for them. A man is not iustified by fayth without the workes of the lawe, for euery man must merite for him selfe. The scriptures are not sufficient to teach vs all trueth, but we must haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written verities. The worde of God is not of soueraine authoritie, for the decrees of the Pope and generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells be equall with it. This is the Papistes creede both in the affirmatiue and in the negatiue. But in that you exhort the Papistes to reade <hi>Caluins</hi> institution, and there to see whether he teacheth any truth therein: I woulde to God that all Papistes in Englande woulde followe your counsell
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:2890:289"/>

This faith therefore of these pluckers downe, must needes vse a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient instrument to destroye, and not to builde: to plucke vp and not to plante, to improue and not to make proofe.

It helped the Anabaptistes against the baptisme of infantes, it was profitable to <hi>Heluidius</hi> against the perpetuall virginitie of Gods mother: and it helpeth all pluckers downe, but it neuer serueth a buylder. The vanity whereof is so well knowen, that I will not stande to talke thereof: namely, seeing it hath no place in our cause, for which we haue brought diuers scriptures, all construed by most learned fathers for that sense: and some so euident, that they droue our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to the open deniall of the holy canonicall scripture.</p>

But when as you saye we frame our argument, of the name of purgatory onely or prayers for the deade, you followe your customable course of lying and sclaundering. And yet we maye saye it is a greate preiudice against your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory and prayer, which you make so necessary, and about which no small parte of your religion is occupyed, that it is not so much as once named in the scriptures.

And therefore the Arians, or Anabaptistes haue no more helpe of this argument then you Papistes. As for the perpetuall virginitie of the mother of Christ, as we can thinke it is true, so because the scripture hath not reueled it, neither perteineth it vnto vs, we make no question of it. what scriptures you haue alleaged, and howe falsely you slaunder vs, for denying the canonicall scripture is set forth at large allready.</p>

                     </gap>. How Lorde like <hi>Maister Grindall</hi> made his Argument here? VVhere he shoulde plainely haue inferred the contrarie after this sorte. There was no sinne so small vnpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but there was some sacrifice of release or expiation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the olde lawe, <hi>ergo</hi> if any man were bounde with sinne, were it neuer so small, whether he were aliue or deade, there was some appointed purgation therefore. For there is no consequence nor any apparance of right deductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to inferre vpon the naming or rehearsall of all sinnes, the peculiar mentioning or plaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hersall of such persons as maye be burdened with those sinnes. There were sacrificies then in the olde lawe for wemen as well as men, for the Princies no lesse then for the poore, for the priest &amp; for the people, for the deade as well as for the liue. And where there was no difference nor respect of persons, in that point there was no peculiar mention to be made, for the distinction of states. The peculiar rehersall therefore, was onely made for the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of offensies, and not alwayes for the difference of persons. And nowe the departed in faith being but distincted by state of life, and not by bonde of sinne from those that be aliue, must needes in the case of like sinne, for the vnitie which he is in, haue the like remedie as the lieue hath for the same sinne. And therefore to helpe your ignorance some thing, thus you must learne:<note place="margin">

                     </note> that
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:2890:290"/>
there was no peculiar sacrifice for the deade, as though they were not of the common body with the liuing, but they had the same sacrifice done for them that the liuing in this worlde in the like case of sinne, or punishment for offensies, had. Doe you not see Gods Church, <hi>Maister Grindall,</hi> sacrifice for the deade? but not for them by a peculiar meanes of offeringe,<note place="margin">

                     </note> but the very selfe same oblation she euer vseth for her Children departed, that she practiseth for her faithfull flocke a liue. And in all other pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, there is a perfect communitie of all benefites betwixt the deceased and their brethern remayning yet in this worlde. And therefore when you seeke for sacrifice in the olde lawe, looke not for any distincte waye of handeling their offensies, which is not common with the lyuing. But consider what there was practised for the release of the smaller trespassies, and that was vsed for both the liue and dead, without distinction. Marke what sacrifice was for the abating of any paine due for great offensies, and the same shall be well vnderstande, to be with out difference practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for the liue and deade together. That therby we may by good reason conclude, seeing sacrifice was then offered for purgation of euery light offense, that it was done for all states of persons that were either in this life, or after their death to be perfectely clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the same. Although the facte of <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> be a plaine proofe that there was a common knowen ordre of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: for else howe coulde he haue conceyued any such sacrifice neuer hearde of before? howe coulde he limite the value of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement therof, by a certaine summe for euery soule deceased? howe coulde he gather in pretence of a thinge neuer vsed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the peoples almes with out their murmure or motion therein? VVhy woulde he haue sent mony to Hierusalem to procure that, which had no example in the lawe, or vse in the Church? was he so ignorant that he knew not their ordre herein, or so vnwise to haue sent his mony for nothing?<note place="margin">

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:2890:290"/>
VVhereby he plainely confesseth, that the lawe had a sacrifice for the deade: which, being vrged by that heretike, he might haue denied with good helpe of his cause, and aunswere to the aduersary: but that the contrary case was so cleare, not onely by that booke which he tooke for Canonicall scripture, as before is proued, but also by the full consent of all the Church of God, which both by plaine practise, and most graue ordinaunce, had from Christes time set forth and approued the vndoubted trueth thereof.</p>

               <p n="3">3 To passe ouer your saucines and scurrilitie being as agreeable to your profession and leuitie, as vnmeete for his grauitie and dignitie whom you name, the argument is of more force then you haue wit to vnderstand. But to beate it smaller, that it may enter into your head, or at least wise that they which haue any brayne in their heades, may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the strength of it, I will vse your owne figure and mode. All lawfull sacrifices were prescribed by the lawe, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the deade was not prescribed by the law, therfore it was no lawfull sacrifice. you aunswere that the rehersal of sinnes proueth not the peculiar persons that may be burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with those sinnes. And with this foolish distinction you thinke you haue broken out of prison. But you that so like a proud foole, take vpon you to help his ignorance, bewray your owne intollerable arrogancie and more then beastly blindnes. For if you had redde the law whereof you make your selfe such a Rabbine, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. you should haue seene the peculiar mentioning and playne rehersing of all such persons for whome sacrifice was to be offered, both men and women, the Princes and the priuate persons the Priest and the whole congregation, yea and speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the oblations of the poore. And in the perticular rehearsing of diuerse kind of persons, and the forme of the sacrifice, named according to euery perticular state, it is so farre of, that the deade shall be reckned that such thinges are enioyned euery of these perticular persons to doe, as it is playne that none but the liuing could offer, or haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offered for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What law was appoynted touching lamenting for the deade, you may reade <hi>Leuit.</hi> 21. how the
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:2890:291"/>
Priest was forbidden to lament for any, but speciall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, also <hi>Nu.</hi> 19. diuerse ordinances concerning the deade yet neuer any sacrifice or prayer for the deade. When <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were slayne, their father and brethren were forbidden to mourne for them, the people were permitted. By all which it appeareth, not only that no sacrifice for the deade, was offered, but that they were so separated from the liuing, that the Priestes might haue nothing to do with any of them, but in speciall cases. And as for your common shift of the common body of the liuing and the deade, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth you nothing, for although all the faithfull make one body in Christ, yet there is one state of them that worke, an other of them that are iudged according to their works, &amp; to put no diuersitie betwene them, is not to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion but a confusion. But of all other it is a clerkely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion that you send <hi>M. Grindall</hi> to looke vpon the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of your masse, whith is a sacrifice both for the quicke &amp; the deade, and thereof will proue that the olde lawe, had but one sacrifice for the liue and the deade. In deede there you were to good for him, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> practise of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popish church be a good president for <hi>Moyses</hi> to follow in his law, we will reason no longer. But the fact of <hi>Iudas Machabaeus</hi> putteth all out of doubt. Surely then the fact of euery man that transgressed the lawe, shall be sufficient to proue what the lawe was and not the booke of the lawe. <hi>For else how coulde he haue conceiued any sacrifice which he neuer hearde of?</hi> How did <hi>Dauid</hi> conceiue the cariage of the arke in a newe cart, which he neuer heard of? except it were of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that sent home the arke in a cart. And euen so it is like, that <hi>Iudas Machabaeus,</hi> if he deuised not that sacrifice of his owne head, yet tooke it by imitation of the Gentiles, whose studies and practises, your owne author confesseth were more frequented in those dayes among the Iewes, then the preaching or keeping of the law. Finally to all the other howes and whyes, I aunswere with one word, he had no warrant of his fact in the law of God. Neither doth <hi>S. Augustine</hi> sufficiently answere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heretike that would proue by that fact, that men dying in deadly sinne might be saued
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:2890:291"/>
by sacrifice. For though they were not vncircumcised for whom <hi>Iudas</hi> sent an offering, yet they dyed in deadly sinne, and such sinne, as for which they were iustly slayne, as your owne author confesseth, for the idolatrous iewells, that they had euery one in their bosomes. Concerning the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of that booke and how it was taken by <hi>Augustine,</hi> I haue aunswered enough before.</p>

The one is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden by the euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t testimony of holy scripture, the other main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth her traine by bolde deniall of scriptures: the one seeketh with humility the meaning at their mouthes, whome God hath vndoubtedly blessed with the gifte of vnderstanding and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, the other by singular pride foundeth her vnfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vpon the phantasies of light and lewde persons, that are pufte too and fro with euery blaste of doctrine. The one resteth vpon the practise of all nations, the vsage of all ages, and the holy workes both of God and man, the other holdeth wholy by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte of our elders, flatery of the present dayes and vnhappy waste of all workes of vertue, religion, and deuotion: the one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the gouernours and appointed pastours of our soules, whose names be blessed in heauen and earth, the other ioyneth to such, as for other horrible heresies &amp; wicked life, are condemned both a liue and deade, of the vertuous, and can not for shame be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their owne scholars. The one hath the warraunt of Gods whole Church, the other standeth on curse and excommunication by the grauest authority that euer was vnder God in earth. To be shorte, trueth is the Churches dearlinge, heresie must haue her maintenaunce abrode. This one, holy, Catholike, and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church is it, wherevnto we owe all duety and obedience both

There is no force of argument, no probability of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, no subtelty of witte, no deepe compasse of wordely wisedome, no eloquence of man, nor Angell, nor any other motion that can be wrought in the world, that shoulde make a man doubte of any article approued by her authority. And if thou yet feare to geue ouer thy whole sense, and thine owne selfe to so carefull a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in whome thou wast begotten in thy better birth, compare our Church with theirs, compare her authority and theirs, her maiesty and theirs.</p>

And as they see this pointe handeled, so let them iudge of the reste. The trueth is vpholden by euident testimony of scripture, the error, by custome, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, and iudgement of men. The trueth seeketh vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the scriptures, of the spirite of God in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, error at the mouthes of mortall men. The trueth resteth vpon the onely authority of God, error vpon the maintenaunce of carnall deuises. The trueth is founded vpon the doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, the other vpon Gentiles and heretikes. Trueth is embraced of the pure and primitiue Church of Christ, error is continued from a corrupt state of the Church of Christ, vnto a plaine departing awaye into the church of Antichrist. To be short, trueth is tryed by the worde of God, heresie by the inuention of men. The holy Catholicke and Apostolicke Church is that which humbly obeyeth the word of God, and the Synagoge of Satan is that which arrogantly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth authoritie aboue the worde. The true Church shall neuer decaye but alwaye reigne with Christ, the false Synagoge shall daily more and more decaye vntill it be vtterly destroyed with Antichrist the heade therof, and last of all be damned with the deuill and his angells. And who so woulde make choyse of a true mother Church, from a whorish Synagoge, let him compare our church with the church of Rome, the authoritie of our church which is the

authoritie of God in his word, with the authoritie of theirs which is the opinions of men, the maiesty and glory of our church which is spirituall, &amp; the whorish outward brauery of theirs which is carnall.
