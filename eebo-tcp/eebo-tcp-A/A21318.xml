         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tymes drunken, wherwith she beinge ashamed, and diuisinge by what meane she might cause hym to leue that horrible vice, at the laste whan he was a slepe, she caried hym vnto the charnell house, wherin were put the bones of deade men, and leuing him lyinge there, she made faste the dore, and departed. And whan she thought that he was wakynge, she takynge with her brede and meate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> retourned to the charnell house and knocked at the dore, her housband fayntly asked who
<pb facs="tcp:574:4"/>
knocked there, the good woman answered, I which haue brought meate with me for the dead men, peace sayd her husbande, thou increacest my payne in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of meate, bringe me some drinke I beseche the. That hering the good woman, alas sayd she that euer I was borne, for this vyce gotten by custome, my housbande hath made it a naturall habyte, which will neuer forsake hym.</p>
            <p>¶ This fable nedeth no declaration: for euery man may perceyue what it meneth. Moreouer many being ignorant of good letters, do vniuersally reproue all them that be studiouse in lerninge, alleginge this com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mune prouerbe, The grettest clarkes be not the wisest men: affirming, that they be founden negligent about their owne profit, and consequently vnapt to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of thinges of waighty importance. How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true their allegations be, &amp; on how feble a foundation they are buylded, it shall in this wise appere vnto wise men. First the sayd prouerb semeth by him which lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lerninge, to be deuised, sens that he preferrith ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance before kunninge: whiche arrogance declared hym to be a very foole, and vnwitty: consideringe that by knowlege most chiefly, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> excelleth al other mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall creatures, and therby is moste like vnto god. And lerninge is none other thinge, but an aggregation of many mens sentences &amp; actes to the augmentation of knowlege. And if som lerned men do neglect their tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poral commodities, it is for one of these causes: eyther by cause they haue ben so desirouse of knowlege, and in respect therof estemed so lytle all other pleasures, that they thought the tyme all to lytle, which they dyd spend in it, holdinge them selfes with that which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:574:5"/>
for natures necessitie right wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, or els like as the grehound that was sent to great Alexander by the king of Albania, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there were shewed vnto him seuerally a gret hart, a bore, &amp; a beare, he vouched not saulf to loke on them, but lay still wagging his tayle: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was there brought forth a great lyon, to whom he dyd arise softly, and setting vp his bristels, &amp; shewing his tethe, fleing to the lyon, lightly strangled him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde a puyssante olyfante beinge brought to the place, the grehounde semynge to reioyce at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the beste, roused him, and after two or thre questinges, he lept to the great olyphant, and after a long fight ouerthrew him and kylled him. So I dout not but that som men there be liuing, in whom is such courage, that in thinges of lytle importance may seme to be negligent, disdayninge as it were to spend their wittes or labours about the pelfry of riches: which be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge ones called to authority ioyned with liberty, wil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Albeit some writers suppose, that Seuerus, before he was emperour, was amorous of a woman in Siria, and by the arte of Astronomie fyndynge in her natiuitie, that she shuld be an emperours mother, he toke her to wyfe, and had issue by her, Uarius the father of Alexander: but fynally the progeny of this Emperour is very vncertayn: wherfore in myne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion his lyfe and actes be the more to be honored and meruayled at, consyderynge that beinge come of soo vncertayne a lynage, and borne so ferre from the citie of Rome, and in so barbarous a countrey, he could so well gouerne the empire of Rome, whiche before his tyme was with pryde and other detestable vyces ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely corrupted.</p>
            <p>¶The mother of Alexander was called Mammea, a woman of notable wysedome, as it shall hereafter appere by the bryngynge vp of her sonne, and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge of hym as well from the vyces, whervnto he was not onely prouoked, but also wel nygh constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by that moste beastely emperour Uarius Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus,

his cousyn germayne and predecessour, not withstandyng there was in that noble woman Mam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mea, a great spyce of auaryce in gatherynge and ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge of treasure, whiche fynally was the only cause of the deathe bothe of her and her sonne.

She had also two doughters, the one called Semiamira, the other Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mea. Semiamira had a sonne named Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus, which was of excellent beaultie. And bicause he was prelate in the temple of the sunne, whome the Phenices do calle Heliogabalus, he was semblablye called by that name, hauyng added thereto the name of Uarius, whiche is in englishe diuers, forasmoche as some men suppose, that he was conceyued of the sede of dyuers men, his mother Semiamira beynge incontinent, and as it were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune to many men, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge the tyme that she abode in the emperours court with her mother. Not withstanding her sonne Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabalus, by the crafty meanes of his grandame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, was declared to be the sonne of the emperour Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus, and by the fauour of the men of warre of the Romayns, who than murmured and had in hatrede the pryde and crueltie of Macrinus (who was empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

And therfore dyuerse tymes by his commandment, the professours of those sciences purposed openly questions.

He wrate the lyues of good princes in verses eloquently, and sange them vnto the harpe and organes, ryghte swetely, but that dyd he onely for recreatynge his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites, whan they were troubled with vehement study: as it often tymes hapned by incomparable laboure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

the great affayres of the weale publyke. He was of visage fayre, and well proporcioned in body: large and goodly of personage, and therwith was stronge and durable to susteyne peynes, as he that knewe his owne strength, and in the preseruyng therof was not founde negligente. Therto he was amiable, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde euery man gentyl, and easy to be spoken vnto. Also there was in hym so moche humanitie and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolence, that he wolde often tymes vysite not onelye the beste and the seconde of his frendes and seruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes beinge sicke, but also them that were inferiours and of base hauyour, desyryng them to tell to him fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they thought of hym, whom he wolde atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifely here. And whan he had herde them throughly, than as the thyng, which was spoken of, did require, he wold diligently amende and correcte it. And whan his mother wolde saye often tymes to hym, Sir ye be to familiar and easye, and therfore ye shall cause the imperiall astate to be the lasse sette by, he aunswered thus, But yet shall it be more sure, and contynue the longer. This was his disposition, procedyng as wel of the perfection of his moste gentylle nature, as of the education of his good and circumspect mother.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ACRINVS</hi> the emperour for his aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and tyrannye beinge abandoned (or rather betrayed) of his owne people, and slaine with his sonne Diadumenus, who in beaultie and goodly stature excelled al men of his tyme, Uarius Heliogabalus, of whom I late spake, was aduaunced vnto the empire, by the hole consent of the Senate and people of Rome, who gaue hasty credence to all reportes that were made to the honour and praise of their newe princis. (Such is the appetites of men, which be meued anon with cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie: for suche thynges as they desyre, they coucyte to here of, and do delite in new tydinges, though it be falsely reported.) But Heliogabalus as soone as he was come vnto Rome, out of the countrey of Siria, he immediately declared his beastely nature, by insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge vices moste abhomynable, and aduauncyng the fauourers and haunters of the same vices, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynge with all his study and puissance, to exterminate out of the citie of Rome all vertue and honestie, from whens a lyttell before, all the world receyued doctrine and example of honour, concernynge as well vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maners, as marciall prowesse.</p>
            <p>¶Fyrste in lechery this Heliogabalus was so insaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:574:12"/>
that not onely he exercysed that vyce openly, in common baynes and bordell houses, with sundry wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of diuerse degrees and countreys: but also he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned a senate of common harlattes, amonge whom were dyuerse noble matrones and damsels of Rome, theyr husbandes or parentes not beinge so hardye to let or rebuke them, vnto whom often tymes, after he and his ribauldes had saciate with them theyr leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous appetites, he made a solemne contio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, callynge them his companions, and exhortynge them to set al theyr study and wytte to induce al other women vnto the fourme of theyr lyuynge: declaring expressely, that he aboue all other thynges moste desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that all men and womenne of the citie of Rome shuld be semblably disposed as he was. I holde it not conuenient to be wrytten in any vulgare tunge, howe he transformed and abused his proper kynde, in such wyse, as I suppose the mooste vicious man nowe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge wolde be ashamed, not onely to beholde it, but also to here it, and that dyd he not onely secretely or in his house, but also openly, all men that wolde, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng and lokinge on hym. I omitte the residue, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che in myne opynion oughte neuer to haue ben wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for abomination therof, moch more neuer to haue ben of any man knowen.</p>
            <p>¶He also promoted to the greattest dignities of the publyke weale, common bawdes, notable ribauldes, solicitours and furtherers of dishonest appetites, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten tymes cokes and deuisats of lecherous confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and sawces: Semblably by such persons he sold dignities, auctorites and offices in the publike weale. He also elected into the Senate, and to the roumes of
<pb facs="tcp:574:13"/>
great capitaynes, dukes, and gouernoures of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys moste vyle personages, not hauynge regard to any age, gentylnesse of bloud, meryte, possessions or substaunce. He had of his priuye counsayle in all his actes, two Carters, the one named Protogenes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and the other Cordius. His glotonye was almoste equall vnto his lechery: in so moch as he therin vanquished Uitellius, of whom it is written, that at one supper he was serued with seuen thousande fysshes, and fyue thousande foules. Heliogabalus whan he soiourned nygh to the see, he wold neuer be seruid with sea fishe: but beinge in places far distante from the sea, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all his houshold to be serued with mooste delycate sea fyshe. It abhorreth me to expresse his beastely ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge, but to the intent that the excellent vertues of his moste noble successour shal be more apparant and commendable (lyke as al thyng that is vile or course, doth set forthe more pleasantly that thynge whiche is precious and fyne) it is requisite that I describe this monster in some parte as he was.

I omytte other lyght fantasyes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue written in my boke called the gouernour, where I treate of sobrietie. Fynally it is remembred, that he was neuer two days togyther serued with one meate, nor ware twyse one garmente, nor companyed twyse with one woman, excepte his wyse. As often as he remoued in progresse, there folowed hym .vi. C. cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riottes laded only with bandes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon harlottes, and rybauldes. This companye had he in stede of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saylours, and so delyted in this forme of lyuyng, that he sayd oftentymes, that if he had a sonne, he wolde ordeyne for hym maisters, that shulde compell hym to lyue in semblable facion. To these monstruous vices he added to crueltie, in puttyng to deathe dyuerse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble senatours. Also vsynge the counsayle of wytches and inchanters, he made his sacrifice with yong chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: And violently rauyshynge from the noble men and women of Italy, their yonge infantes, he caused in his presence their bodies to be opened they lyuyng, and most cruelly serched in their tender bowelles for his moste damnable desteny. He had in speciall fauor one named Zoticus, who for familarite vsed betwene them, was taken of all the chiefe officers for the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours husbande. This Zoticus vnder the colour of the sayd familiaritie, solde all the sayinges and doin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the emperour, intendyng to accumulate abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of rychesse, by promisynge fayre to many men, but fynally deceyuynge all men. for commynge out of the emperours priuy chamber, after that he had herd euery man speake, that suyd vnto him, to som he wold say, thus sayd I to themperour of you, vnto an other
<pb facs="tcp:574:14"/>
Of you I herde the emperour saye thus to daye. To dyuers he wold say, Your matter or request shal come this to passe. As is the facion of suche maner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones, whiche beinge from a base condicion admitted of princis into ouermoche familiaritie, they selle the fame and renome of their masters. Such as I haue rehersed were the counsaylours of Heliogabalus. for al wyse and vertuous men he deedly hated. Wherfore he banished the noble man Sabinus, vnto whom Ul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ably he put out of the citie the sayde Ulpian, onely bycause he was named a good manne, and caused Siluinus the noble oratour, whom he had made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to Alexander, to be put to dethe. And he ordeyned a tumbler to be great maister of his housholde, a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter named Gordius he made capitayne of his garde. An other tumbler he made chefe captayn of an army. The greattest rouines and affaires of the empyre, he commytted to mynstrels, players of enterludes and dysardes. To his bondmen and most vyle seruantes as they excelled in abhomination, so preferred he them to the gouernance of realmes and prouinces. Also of his rabell of brothelles, to some he gaue the rule and gouernance of the youth of the citie: som he made ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the senate, to other he gaue preeminence and souerayntie ouer al them that were gentilmen, finally he intended to distroy all vertue, and to constrayne all men to lyue beastely as he dyd. And for that cause he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that the noble Alexander his auntes sonne shulde be slayne, either violently or by some poyson: forasmoche as he perceyued hym to declyne from his appetite: but Alexander was alwaye preserued by the

And sodaynly apprehended his adherentes and familiars, and with sundry tormentes dyd put them to dethe. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally pursuyng Heliogabalus to a priuie or draught, wherevnto he fledde, there they slewe hym, and his mother Semiamira, and afterwarde his horrible ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayn being drawen throughout the citie with hookes, was of all the people defyled with ordure, and other matter foule and stynkyng, &amp; at the last was brought with all kyndes of reproche, to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon draughtes of the citie, wherinto they wolde haue throwen hym, but for as moch as the hole of the draught coulde not receyue hym, they tyed him to a stone of great weight, and threwe hym into the ryuer of Tyber, to the intent that he shulde neuer be buryed. This was the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and conuenient ende of this most beastly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clene monster, who with the emperors Nero, Caligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Domitian, and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modus, his predecessours, was a notable and commodius example to all princis suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedynge, to declare, that not withstandynge their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and puissance, they for their vices abhominable,

were fyrste hated, and afterwarde slayne, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by their propre subiectes.</p>
            <p>¶And in this hystorie it is to be specially noted, that not withstandynge that he not onely permytted, but also wylled his subiectes to lyue in a licence, and with out correction, for synne, moreouer vsed toward them suche lyberalitie, that he fedde them with moste dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and exquisite meates, gaue vnto theym money in habundance, and also to them, whiche dyned or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with hym, he gaue all the vessel and plate, were it of golde or syluer, wherwith he was serued, and made many other distributions to the hole people wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sumptuous: Yet the Romayns not withstanding abhorrynge in hym their owne propre vices, or rather beyng therwith saciate or tedious, they fynally slewe hym, as is before written, after that he hadde reygned syx yeres, &amp; being than but in the .xxi. yere of his age.</p>

Wherfore they contended amonge them selues, whiche of them moughte applye to hym moste titles and names of dignitie. wherfore he was the fyrste that receyued at one tyme all ornamentes and tokens of honour, aydynge therto the name of

Cesar, which a fewe yeres before he had receyued, but moche rather his honeste lyfe and vertuous maners, wherby he obteyned suche fauour of all menne, that whan Heliogabalus wold haue slayne hym, he could not brynge it to passe, the men of armes resisting, and the senate obstynatelye refusynge: but all these were but trifels in regarde that he approued him selfe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, whom the senate ought to saue harmelesse, whom the men of warre desyred to be in saufegarde, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by the sentence and opinion of all good men, was electe to be Emperour, beynge than but of the age of .xvi. yeres. Notwithstandynge he was than of suche a wonderfull sobernesse, that where the senate wolde haue gyuen to hym the surname of Antonine (which name for the incomparable vertues that were in Antoninus Pius, and Antoninus the philosopher late Emperours, was vsurped of other Emperours folowynge, for a pryncipall title of honour) he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly refused it: semblably dyd he the name of great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, sayinge openly vnto the senate.</p>

And who was more harmelesse than Uerus Antoninus? Noble fathers, these hyghe names of honour be bourdonous and to greuouse for my youthe to susteyne.

it is moche more incongruent, consydering that with better reason I moughte haue taken the name of Antonine, induced by colour either of affiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or els of equall astate in the imperial maiestie. but the name of great Alexander, wherfore shuld I haue it? What gret thinges haue I yet done to deserue that name, whiche Alexander the greke after great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, Pompei the Romayne after many triumphes, had gyuen vnto them?

            <p>¶This moderate and sobre aunswere of so yonge a prynce, inflamed immediately the hartes of the senate and people moche more to honour hym, than if he had receyued those straunge names: and from that tyme he had the renoume of Constance and grauitie. More ouer for his great Austeritie agayne the presumption and lightnesse of his souldiours and seruauntes, he was named of them Seuerus, which betokeneth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante or sharpe in punishemente. whiche name in his tyme gat hym moche reuerence, and afterward great fame and renoume amonge his successours.

His aparaile was wonderful cleane, but not to sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouse and after some mennes opinion, more meaner than to his astate apperteyned.

            <p>¶Fynally no daye passed, wherin he dydde not some thynge charitably, gentylly, or honorablye, but that

            <p>¶He wolde not suffer any of his courte to weare any garment myxte with golde, or other wyse preciouse or costely: nor he hym selfe delyted in ryche apparayle, saying, That gouernaunce was in vertue and not in beautie or costly apparayle.</p>

Wherfore on a tyme whan an ambassadour had gyuen to the empresse two orient perles of wonderful greatnesse, he commanded them to be solde.

therby declarynge, that such thynges eyther for the inestimable pryce was meter for goddes than for men, or for the vnprofytable beaultie therof, serued onely for persons of wanton appetites, whereof Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus was goddesse and patronesse.</p>

            <p>¶ In feastes or bankettynge he neuer wolde haue any wanton pastyme. His pleasure was to beholde birdes fyghtyng together.

had a boke by hym and radde therin oftentymes, but that was in greke, for the more part. In open feastes he vsed the same simplicitie that he did in his palaice.</p>
            <p>¶He so moche had flattery in hatred, that he wolde not here oratours or poetes speke any thynge to his prayse, callynge it folyshenesse: but he harde gladlye orations, perswadynge to vertue, and also the actes of other good pryncis, as wel Romayns as Grekes, specially the prayse of Alexander the greate, whiche conqueryd the more parte of the worlde.</p>
            <p>¶He went oftentimes openly to the common scholes to here rhetoriciens and poetes grekes and latynes. He harde also oratours recitynge causes, whiche they had prosecuted eyther before hym, or before the great offycers.</p>
            <p>¶Fynally he so moch estemed and fauoured lerning that he ordeyned greatte salaryes to be gyuen to rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torycians, teachers of grammar, phisitions, astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, geometricians, musiciens, deuisers of building and ingines.<note place="margin">Archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti.</note> And prouided for theym places to reade in, and scholars also, gyuynge to poore and honeste mennes chyldren that hard them, theyr commons fre. with lyke charitie he reteined aduocates in pore mens causes.

            <p>¶He also yerelye perused his lawes, and refourmed them accordynge as occasion changed or hapned. and he hym selfe diligently and rigorousely executed them in his owne personne and seruauntes. And therwith was of suche gentylnesse, that he wolde offer to gyue

He neuer dyd wronge to any person, semblably of wronges he was a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente and sharpe persecutour, sauinge, That in his owne wronge he was moche more tractable than in a straungers. If he laye not with his wyfe, he was in the mornynge betyme in his priuie closet, where were sette the ymage of Christe, also the pictures of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Socrates, Apollonius, and other uncient and vertuouse men, where, by the space of halfe an houre, he remayned in prayers.

            <p>¶<hi>NOBLE AND EXCELLENT</hi> prince, the fame of your aduauncement vnto the gouernaunce of the empire, was to me as it is vnto all the worlde, moste ioyfull tydynges, consyderyng the lamentable astate of our publyke weale, with the certayne hope that all men haue in you, being meued with your vertues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable, whiche dayly more and more ye do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feste by your moste honorable example in lyuyng, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to all that do beholde, not only your royal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone, but also your seruantes and familiar company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

But most noble prince, although for these qualities, ye deserue prayse and loue of your subiectes, yet in the imperiall maiesty requyreth to be a more straunge countenance, and a seld and difficult accesse vnto your person, consyderyng that by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie of hym that is a mayster or gouernour, as well euyll men as good, do receyue boldnes to speke, and they whiche be euyll, do busyly assaut hym, either

with flatterye, or with detractynge of other, wherby princis, although they be of good natures, and welle brought vp by their parentes, yet be they oftentymes transformed into monsters, that is to say, into beastly lyuers or rauenouse tyrantes. I omyt contempt, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che induced by familiaritie, bryngethe the subiecte to disobedience. Let it not displease you, that I seme to haue in your hyghnesse any suspition. Uerily as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hath a faire and honest wife, wherby he is meued to loue her entierly, wold not haue her gladly stand in the market place, and admytte without discrepance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery manne equally, and with lyke pleasaunt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, suffer euery man to speake to her what he lyste, although he knoweth her to be vertuous and consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: as welle foras moche as the naturall shamefastnesse that ought to be in a woman, may not admytte suche open resort and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, as also the eares that be often assaulted, can not euer escape, but be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so well fortified with wysedome, at the laste lyke a castell wall, they beinge sore shaken with many swete wordes and long enteruieu, they yeld at the last, yl cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome expellynge shamefastnes, and fynally all wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome being reiected, and nothyng set by.

<pb facs="tcp:574:21"/>
so we desyre to haue you resyst al occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that mought gyue neuer so lytel a pathe for flatterers, detractours, and promoters of vice, to entre into your counsayle or fauour. Who can aduaunte hym selfe to be well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from this nette of hypocrisie, whyche hath (as I mought say) sundry and dyuers meshes of flatteryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, whiche vneth any man can escape that wyll tary vntyll the nette be cast ouer hym? The remedye than is eyther with maiestie to repell it, or to cut it asunder with sharp rebukes: and that in the presence of other: or so greuousely to persecute alway those hypocrites, I do meane flatterers, with open punyshment, that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may knowe &amp; abhorre them. And that other therto by nature inclyned, may be euer aferde of lyke experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the fyrst way is most sure vndoutedly. For rebuke and punyshment commeth after the daunger, but maiestie precedeth, and therfore more profytteth. For suche persones rebuked or punyshed, perchaunce excusynge them selfe that they do it by to ardent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and desyre to please, or by their youth and lacke of experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or recognysing their foly, and promisyng amendment, may happen eftsones to crepe into fauor and than they worke their nette soo fynely, that it can not so sone be perceyued, and pytcheth it more couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applienge it aptly to their maisters conditions, soo that it shalbe almost impossible for hym to escape, but that in one meishe or other he shall be tangled. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise by maiestie (that is to saye, statelye counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and difficulte accesse) ioyned with wysedome. impresseth such reuerence, that men not only do feare to approche vnto their soueraygne lorde, oneles they be called, but also to speake any thynge, whereby they

Moreouer whan they hadde expelled hym out of the citie, to the intent they moughte haue more familiar accesse vnto theyr gouernours, and fynd in them more affabilitie, from thense forth vnto the tyme of Caius Cesar, they yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elected newe gouernours, callyng them Consules, as it were counsailours: supposyng that in theyr time of auctoritie, the remembraunce that they shoulde be priuate personnes the nexte yere folowynge, shulde cause them to vse the people the more famyliarly and also gentylly. And whan those officers beinge of long tyme chosen of the nobilitie onely, became in processe of tyme haulte mynded and sterne towardes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munaltie, the people with long sedition compelled the Senate to ioyne at the last, with a noble man in that office one of theyr company.</p>

            <p>¶There was aboute the sayde Emperour a man of great honour called Uetronius Turinus, whome for his great wytte and sagenes in apparance, the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had in syngular fauour, in so moche as he called hym to his priuye counsayle, and vsed to be with hym more famylyar than he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly with any other, whiche so moche blynded the inward eye of Turinus, that he coulde not se in hym selfe, whych he not longe before had condemned in other. suche incomparable swetenes is founde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the familiar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of princis. Wherfore lyke as whan the companions and seruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Ulysses had eaten abundantly of the herbe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Lotos, the taste therof was so pleasant and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylous, that all that eate therof, forgettynge their owne propre countrey, coueted to remayne styl in that region, where that herbe grewe, and but only by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb facs="tcp:574:33"/>
they coulde not be broughte to their shyppes, to retourne to their propre houses: semblably Turinus after that he had ben with the emperour in an inward and secrete familyaritie, he founde it so pleasant, that forgettyng from whense he was callyd, and takynge lyttell hede of any other parte of his offyce, he put his hole study and delectation to augment the opynion of men, that thought that the emperour wolde nothyng do, without his aduyse, wherby he shulde be magny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed and honoured aboue all other of the emperours counsaylours. And therfore he had contynuall suite made vnto hym, as well by them that had sutes to the Emperour in their particular causes, as others that loked for offyces or great promotions. To euery man a parte he wolde promyse his fauour, and therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued great rewardes &amp; presentes. but fynally whom he knewe that the emperour had preferred in offyce, or anye thynge determyned in his iuste cause.

Fynally by the colour of this familyar and secrete recourse that he had to the emperour, he gathered moche treasure: but at the last dyuers, and in great numbre, to whome he hadde

               </gap> as is also preserued, consyderyng that the publyke weale in estimation is to be preferred before the materiall citie, as moch as the lyfe of man and renoume of vertue be of more value than stone or timber, wherwith the wal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les and houses be buylded. And therfore Aristotle, in defynyng what is a Citie,<note place="margin">Citie.</note> doth not cal it a place buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with houses, &amp; enuironned with walles, but saith, that it is a company, which hath sufficiencie of liuing, and is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitute or assembled to the intent to lyue wel. Wherfore it is the people and the weale of theym that maketh the citie. And the destruction and subuersion therof, oughte with more rigour and vehemente pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishement, to be reuenged, if more sharpe punishment maye be than deathe, than brennynge and beatynge downe of materiall houses or walles.</p>
            <p>¶This well and deepelye consydered, it shall not be thought, that they that haue reafoned for the mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Turinus punishement, had before in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce and sufficiently examyned the greuousenesse of his offence, accordynge as I haue declared it, but only considered his bare act without any circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But yet the treason doone also to me, aggrieueth the trespace. Is it not treason, to conspire the destruction of thy soueraygne lorde? most of al, of whom thou art entierly fauoured, and put in great trust. Is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diuersitie betwene the stickyng of hym with a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or kyllyng hym with poyson, and by some circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stance to cause his people to rebelle agaynst him, &amp; in theyr furie to slee hym? who comparynge to gether the fourme and maner of these offences, wyll not suppose it reason, that the punishementes therfore, shulde be
<pb facs="tcp:574:36"/>
moche more vehement and sharpe than for any other transgression, sense iustice limitteth equall punisshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in proportion, accordyng to the importance, that is to saye, The greatnes or smalnesse of the offences.</p>
            <p>¶Nowe let vs consyder the qualitie or substance of Turinus mysdemeanour. In the tyme of the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Seuerus and Caracalla, he was in smalle esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but after that I was elect emperour, he craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily smellynge out my disposition, by lyttell and lytell acquaynted hym selfe with some of those, of whome for their vertues I had best opinion, and counterfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng their maners, he at the last so aptly set forth such grauitie, whiche he adourned also with a wonderfull sharpnes and promptitude of wytte, that he opteyned to be kyghly recommended vnto me by the wisest men of my counsayle, by whose aduyse fyrst I made hym one of my treasorers. Fynally I called hym nere me, and made hym of my pryuye counsayle, wherein we founde hym so necessary, that in our opinyon his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were equiualent, and sometyme surmounted them that had ben in moste estimation. And to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that he wold augment that opinion and credence that we had in hym, he euer vsed a great seueritie or straytenes in his sentences agayne flatterers, dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, and persones corrupted, namely suche as solde their endeuour or diligence in optaynyng our fauour in any matter or for any offyce. And by his industrye dyuerse were detected vnto me, and punysshed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their merites. For these causes I more &amp; more toke hym in fauour, and to incourage other to ensue his example, I dydde aduaunce hym as ye knowe, to the hyghest dignities within the citie, except the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:574:36"/>
&amp; haue participate with hym our most priuy secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, vsing him so familiarly, that dyuers other of our counsaylours haue partly disdayned. Nowe beholde what he hath done. Fyrste he hath deceyued and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vs with his hypocrisy, abusynge our symplicitie and wynnynge our fauour, and not our fauour only, but also our credence &amp; trust, wherby he mought final<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly worke to his priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, and to our confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For he being with vs in such familiaritie as none other was, he practised those thinges that we most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, that is to say extorcion, sellynge of ryghte and wrong, and marchandysyng of offyces and dignities. To whome is extorcion or brybes not greuous? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the gyuer receyueth great lucre. Is there any thyng to be more abhorred than sellynge of Iustyce, whiche knoweth no reward? Howe moche more intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable is the sellynge of iniustice or wronge, wherby the one part suffreth damage by sustaining of wrong, the other is more indamaged by lesynge of his good name and also his money, if it happen, as it hath done oftentymes, by a good &amp; rightuous gouernour, that he whiche hath done wrong, be compelled to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution: But pryncipally and aboue all other am I moste indamaged. For I vnwares &amp; innocent being brought into the hatrede of men, shulde be distroyed before that I mought knowe that I were in perylle. Now consyder ye the importance of Turinus offence, conferryng it with al that whyche I haue rehersed, &amp; by the way remember, that not only he that sleeth his prynce, or depopulateth his countreye, and maketh it desolate, but also he that conspireth to do it, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to endeuoreth hym selfe with al his puissance, though
<pb facs="tcp:574:37"/>
he be let by some occasion or study, deserueth to dye by the determynation of Iustyce dyst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>butife. By what meane he wolde do it, it is not material: except perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture some man mought suppose, that the acte were more odious of him that procurid the people to distroy their owne prince or countrey, whome they are bounde by allegiance &amp; duetie with al their power to defende, than of hym that do sollicite strangers or ancient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, to inuade his countrey. Fynally if any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon person, neuer receyuyng of me any benefite wolde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte in the eares of people, that I wente aboute to chaunge the astate of the weale publyke of this noble citie, to slee all the senatours, to withdrawe the people from their ancient lyberties, and fynally to bryng the maiestie of the empyre into a tyrannye, and by suche false information excyteth and styreth the senate and people to hate me, and couete my destruction: suche one proued at the last to haue sayd falsely, I beleue ye wolde not thynke onely worthye to dye, but ye wolde with your owne handes dysmembre hym, and plucke hym in pieces. Why shulde you not than thynke, that Turinus, whome I moste fauoured, and was about me moste secrete, not by reportynge euyll of me, (why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che perchaunce wolde not be beleued) but by actuall dedes and openlye, commyttynge iniustyce, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannye, in mayntaynynge, supportynge, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortynge wronges, extorcions, oppressyons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enormities agaynste the weale publyke, also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncyng euyll and vngratious personages to dyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities and offyces, wherby iustyce ought to be myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, and the publyke weale gouerned, and by these meanes quenchynge the good opinyon and loue that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:574:37"/>
all men had towarde me, and chaungynge it to a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent grutche &amp; hatred, they thynkynge that Turinus dyd al thyng by our apoyntment, styre the hartes of the people against me: why shuld ye not I say, think, that such one hath deserued to dye? And as he was with vs in syngular fauour and trust, and therin lyke to none other: so ought his dethe to be syngular and strange, that by the noueltie thereof it maye be more terryble, wherby other may feare from hensforthe to abuse in suche maner our affabilitie, which beinge in vs natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, without such a munition can not be sure and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preserued. And for this our sentence no man ought to deme vs cruell, or to lacke mercy, yf he consyder di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygently all that we haue spoken. And do also remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that to kepe an infinite numbre of men from the rygour of Iustyce, I spare not to execute the same ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour on hym, whom I specially fauoured.</p>
            <p>¶After that the emperour had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded in this wise his reson, there was no man offred to reply therto, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyuynge hym rather meued with zeale than with any particular displesure, and to say the truthe, whan they had pondered his consyderations, not fyndyng suffy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient argument to confound his opinion, fynally they all being in numbre fyfty wise and honourable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saylours, reioyced that they had soo wyse and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse an emperour, whyche preferred Iustyce and the weale of his people, before any pryuate affection or singular appetite. Than immediatly folowed the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Turinus, whyche was appoynted by the Emperour, in fourme as ye herde it declared in the laste Chapyter.</p>

depeached. This was the sayeng of Alexander.</p>
            <p>¶And therfore by the consent of the senate and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ordayned fyrst according to the counsel of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, certayne persons, whyche were named Conserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the weale publyke: to whose offyce it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned to se, that the chyldren of the Romaynes were well brought vp and instructed accordynge to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of their wyttes, frome the age of seuen yeres vnto syxtene, and that in theyr playes and recreation were nothynge dishonest. Also that at certayne tymes appoynted, they were exercysed in ryding, if they were sonnes of gentylmen. Also they and the resydue, were exercysed in swymmyng, runnyng, wrastlyng, and to occupye all weapons of warre. Semblablye that the maydens, durynge the sayde age, were brought vp in shamefastnes, humblenesse, and occupation necessary for a housewyfe. And that they were not seene out of their fathers houses, but only in the temples, vnto the which women only resorted, and that in the company of their mothers or such other as were in their places.</p>
            <p>¶Moreouer it pertayned to the sayd Conseruators, to controll euery householder, of what estate or degre so euer he were, yf there were founde any excesse in his fare, or that he had resort of riottous persons: or that he kept any mo seruauntes than had roumes in theyr howses, or in some necessary busynesse were contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally occupyed.</p>
            <p>¶Also that no man neyther in hym self, his wyfe, nor his seruantes shulde excede or in any part change the apparayle that by the lawes or the emperours ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces had ben prouyded.</p>

            <p>¶These Conseruatours were three score in numbre, that is to saye, For euery trybe two, Rome beinge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into .xxx. tribes. and twise in the wike they asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>¶The Pretores, Questores, and other lyke offyces and authorities he augmented in number, all be it he deuyded theyr iurisdictions, to some he appoynted onely contractes, in the whiche worde were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all thynges wherin bargayne or promyse was conteyned: and that he caused to be extremely examy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and discussed by the sayde officers, and in whome was founden to be any dysceipte or faythe broken, he withoute hope of any remyssyon or pardon, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately beaten with whyppes: which was also the punishement of them that had stolen pryuyly without any violence. The emperour saying, That it was but of fantasye and a thynge to laughe at, to make a dyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb facs="tcp:574:44"/>
betwene stealynge and disceit or breakyng his bargayne, where it appereth to be no dyuersitie, but onely that this hath truste and credence ioyned with it: and the other hath none, but is a syngle iniurye. Wherfore in reason it is the lyghter offence, where, by the other meanes, not onely the thyng is gotten with as moche iniustice as if it were stolen: but also faythe other wyse called truste, whiche is the foundation of Iustice, and consequently of the publike weale, is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued. And therfore it ought to be reuenged with no lasse punishment than symple theft.</p>
            <p>¶Puruayours for graine to the citie he made of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neste and diligent persones, and to theym he assigned particuler auditours, notwithstandynge at the ende of the yere, bothe the puruayours and auditours lefte theyr offices, and other were chosen.</p>
            <p>¶ To them that were his baylyffes receyuours sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyours and other that procured or gathered the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues of his crowne, he gaue competente salaries: but be fauoured them not, callynge them a necessarye euyll. Wherfore if he perceyued, that any of them had gathered moche rychesse, he wolde take al from them, sayinge, Let it suffise you, that ye haue taken so long pleasure with my goodes: and beware that ye take not from other men iniustely, leste ye make me more angry with you. All be it if he perceyued any of them afterwarde to lyue vpryghtly, and to haue good wyt and lernynge he aduaunced them to some other rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, wherwith they confessed theyr seruyce to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced.

            <p>¶To the prouoste he ioyned .xiiii. whiche had benne Consules, callyng them gouernours of the citie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundynge them to here with the prouoste, the affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the citie.

Therfore to suche practyse or mystery, he admytted onelye straungers. And also to brynge out of other countreys and to selle to the citezens all suche
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:574:45"/>
thynges as therof was none growynge in Italye, or not in sufficient quantitie, as wolles, mettall, &amp; sylke. Foreseene that none of it were wroughte in any place out of Italy. And of suche strangers it was lefull to the Romaynes, to bye in grosse, and retayle, All be it there shuld no mo retayle than were appoynted by the Senate: and those also shulde be examyned and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned by the Prouost of the citie, and suche as were to hym associate. And the sayde marchaunte straungers were by the Emperours commaundement very cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taisely entertayned, and so were all other straungers, whiche repayred to the citie to bye there any thyng, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles to practise any excellent kunnynge or crafte, and were exonerate of all charges for the warres, excepte it were onely for the defence of the citie. But of theym he suffred to be but a certayne number, whiche was not lauful for them to excede. And vnto them were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed of the Romaynes certayn iudges and officers, which yerely also were chaunged. But nowe to treate howe he kepte the people from idelnesse.</p>
            <p>¶Fyrste he prouyded, that where there was not any artifice or craft necessary, but that it mought be found within the citie, which he ordred in this wyse. He knew euery yere ones by the officers called <hi>Censores,</hi> howe moche people were dwellinge in the citie of euery age. Also by them whiche were called <hi>Ediles,</hi> howe many householdes there were of euery crafte. Than wolde he diligentely enserche, of what perfection theyr war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes were, wherin they were occupied. and if he found therin moche lacke, so that the byars shulde suffer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymente, than inioyned he the seller therof, that he shuld no more worke to sale, vntyll he were instructed
<pb facs="tcp:574:46"/>
more perfaitely. Not withstandynge that person was compelled to worke vnder an other man, whiche was more perfyte, vntyll his worke were commended.</p>
            <p>¶Moreouer he ordeyned, that after that the children of the communers could wryte and rede perfytly, they were set to some artifice or crafte. But if within one yere it appered, that they were vnapte therevnto, or that it were moche contraryouse vnto theyr nature: than the Conseruatours examyning as moch as they coulde, to what crafte or science necessary theyr wittes were moste apte, vnto that shulde they forthewith be sette, to lerne of theym whiche were good warkemen. And therfore he gatte oute of all partes of the empire the moste kunnynge and parfecte craftesmen in euery science to dwel in the citie, not onely compellyng them by his auctoritie, but allurynge them with yerely sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes of grayne, to the fyndynge of theyr househol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and also to be free frome all maner exactions in peace or warre, to instructe in theyr craftes perfectely the youthe of the citie.</p>
            <p>¶The craftes, whiche he wolde that the more parte of Romaynes shuld occupie, were those, wherin both the body and wytte moughte be exercysed, whiche he sayde perteyned to men that were free of condition: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occupations, wherin was bodely labour onelye, he sayde was for bondemen and beastes. And therfore within the territorye of the citie of Rome, and in the manours and serines of the gentylmen Romaynes, he ordeyned that bailyfes and surueyours of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry shuld be fre men and citezens, and that the plough men and laborars shulde be bondmen and strangers. In other cities besydes Rome, some of these thynges
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:574:46"/>
were chaunged after the necessitie and nature of the people, wherin this emperour alway had a maruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous consyderation.</p>
            <p>¶After this diligent prouision, if any one of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had ben found idell by the space of one hole day, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cept in feastfull days &amp; other tymes of solace appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he was forthwith examyned, and hauynge no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and approued excuse, he was fyrste whypped, and after by the Conseruatours commytted to one of the craftes, that he was of, and for euery day that he was openly sene to be idell, the persone vnto whom he was commytted, shuld for a moneth set hym to any labour that he lyst, as his slaue or bondman, gyuynge to him meate and drynke onely. And it was not to any other man lefull, durynge that tyme, to gyue hym meate or drynke, or to speake with hym, other wyfe than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke hym. And after the sayd correction, the said Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seruatours shulde see that he were bestowed where he moughte worke with a competent lyuynge.</p>
            <p>¶The semblable order was dilygentely, and (as I mought saye) exactly kepte by the Emperours straite commaundemente, bothe in Greece and Italye. And where execution anye tyme fayled, or was neglected, the officers were deposed with open reproche, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayture of the thyrde parte of theyr substaunce: which was employed immediately on grayne, and distrybu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted equally and freely amonge the people wel occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, within the citie or towne where suche thynge hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He made also many fayre houses and mancion places, whyche immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he gaue to his frendes, whome he perceyued to be moste trusty and honest.

And for the mortal hate and indignation that he bare to this losse of tyme (for so ought it rather to be called, than a play) He made a lawe, which was ratified by the authoritie of all the senate and people.

Frontine honorable father, what a pernyciouse neglygence was in our predecessours Emperours, besides the il example of diuerse of them, which haue like il tutours, suffred the people of Rome theyr pupilles so many yeres, dayly to consume them selues by licence in lyuynge, whiche hath brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the citie suche horrible sickenesse, whiche I wyl pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide to expell thense if it be possible.</p>
            <p>¶The nexte daye folowynge he assembled his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle,
<pb facs="tcp:574:53"/>
whiche as I sayde before was of fyfty reuerend personages, to whom he declared the communication betwene hym and Frontine, who at that tyme was pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sente, beinge one of the counsaylours, affyrmyng that he was fully determyned, as wel to prouyde for them, whiche eyther were attached with the sayde horryble syckenesses, and for those whiche were by warres for the weale publike mutulate in theyr membres, or mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as also to put cleane awaye, or at the leste waye to minyshe the originall occasyons of the sayde sycke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. Whiche noble entreprise beinge of al them that herde hym, commended: fynally it was thought expe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dient by the noble Emperour, and by all his sayd cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle approued, that within the citie of Rome there shulde be two fayre and large hospytalles builded, to receyue and kepe theym, whiche were soo mutulate or maymed in the warres, that they coulde not exercyse theym selues in manuell occupation (for all other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were done by captiues, bondemen, and slaues, and the Romaines were therof discharged) Also with out the citie in some village nygh to it, wherby passed some ryuer, shulde also be edified two other hospital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ample and necessary for fyue hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred sick persons, vnto whom shuld be appoynted fyue phisitions, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancially lerned in phisike, and well experienced. Also fyue expert surgeons, with two apoticaries, men of good credence and trust, whiche shulde be bounden to haue alway al necessary drouges, vigorous in their force and vertue, without sophistication or other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte in symples or compoundes. Also that they shuld burne or vtterly reiect all thynges, whiche were eyther corrupted, or so dryed, that it shulde seme to the phisy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:574:53"/>
(who shuld as oft as they list examin the wares) to be noyous, or to medicine vnprofytable. The meate whiche was ordeyned for these sicke persones, shulde be so lyttell in quantitie, that it was lesse than suffycy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for any hole person. And whan it was asked of the Emperour, why he wolde that they shulde haue so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell a pytaunce, he answered meryly, that he dyd it for thre speciall consyderations. The fyrste was, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> had red in the bokes of Galene, the most excellent phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that the more one nourisshed bodies vncleane, and not sufficyentely pourged, the more he dyd hurte them. Also if the meate were more than the sycke men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> coulde eate, the ministers about them wolde selle that whiche was lefte, and whan they had gathered therby moche money, eyther they wold lyue therwith riotous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and neglecte theyr dueties in attendynge the sicke folke, or elles with that gayne prouyde for them selues some more welthy and easy lyuynge, so that in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the sycke people shuld be destitute of conuenient ministers to awayte on them. The thyrde consydera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> was, that if the sycke men hadde abundaunce of good meate, many of them remembrynge, that whan they were hole, they shulde be constrayned to some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, and that they shulde not than eate so moche meate and so good, as they eate in the hospital, where they laye well and at reste. Wherfore perchance whan they were hole, they wolde fynde the meanes to fal eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones in theyr sayde syckenes or other lyke, that they moughte be brought agayne to the hospitall. Suche myserable nature r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:574:54"/>¶These allegations of the wyse emperour was than confyrmed, by dyuerse whiche had knowen it by long experience. Concernynge them whiche were mutulate or maymed in warres for the weale publik, they shuld haue a more plentiouse entertaynement, if he were in pouertie or lacked frendes. But they whiche were not in that necessitie, shulde haue appoynted by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and the Emperours consente, an honeste propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in corne and wyne, to spend in theyr owne houses, as a thankefull remembrance of the Senate and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for theyr good endeuour whyles they were able.</p>
            <p>¶Moreouer to prouyde for tyme to come, that is to saye, that the causes before remembred, whereof the sayde horrible sickenesses proceded, he affyrmed, that the beste and moste sure meane, was to pacifye the ire of god, and to make hym beneuolent vnto the people, whiche shulde be moste assuredly done, by excludinge horrible vices and abhominations out of the cite, and to honour god purely. As for the disposition of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bodies, made apte by surfettes and idelnesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue corruption, and consequently horrible sickenes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he determyned to make an Edict or imperyall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynaunce, confyrmed by an acte of the Senate, that no man shuld vse mo than two meales in one day, and that there shoulde be at the leaste .vi. houres betwene euery meale. Also that the Censores or correctours of maners, shulde take diligent hede, that if they founde or were informed, that any manne of the comminaltye wente to his meale, before he had wrought sufficiently in some occupation, that the same Censores shoulde cause hym to be apprehended and kepte in some pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by the space of three dayes, hauynge but ones in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:574:54"/>
the daye onely, one ounce of breade, and a lyttell wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without any other nourishement: the Emperour here rehersynge a prouerbe, wherof he had herde part of the chrysten men:
<q>Let hym eate that laboureth, for he that laboureth not, is not worth that thyng that he eateth.</q>
And suche as moughte not be withdrawen from ydel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, he wolde haue them sent into Spayne, to digge for gold: or into the iles called Cassiterides, to labour in tynne workes. And if within a whyle they laboured well without cohertion or grutchynge, those shulde be reuoked into the citie, there to apply diligentely theyr occupation.</p>
            <p>¶He wolde also that the common people shoulde not haue at one meale, but one kinde of fleshe or fyshe, and that shulde not be eyther delycate, or in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And if any man were founde doinge other wife, he shulde forfayte to the common treasory double the va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lue of the meate whiche he had for that meale prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And that no gentylman shuld haue mo than thre sundry dyshes at oone meale, besydes fruite: nor any senatour aboue .iiii. diuerse dishes, and one kynde of fruite if he lyste. Whiche number he hym selfe dyd not excede, although no lawe dyd therto compell hym. He wolde not that any citizen shuld resort to open tauern, but that euery man shoulde haue his prouision in his owne house. And that tauernes and common Cookes shuld serue onely for them, whiche dwelled out of the citie, and came thyther for some necessarye busynesse. And if any citezen were founde in tauerne, eatynge or drynkynge, he shulde be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

credence or possibilitie to any preferment. At the thyrd tyme he shulde be sent to the mynes, and there remain, vntyl he seemed to haue amended his maners. A gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylman shulde be at the fyrste tyme rebuked. at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond tyme, lose the name of a gentylman, and be reke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amonge the base people. the thyrde tyme his goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des shulde be commytted to a tutour, wherof he shuld haue no portion, vntyll it were well perceyued that he had vtterly lefte resortynge to tauernes. A Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour beinge founde in suche places, shuld incontinent be discharged out of the Senate, beinge durynge his lyfe without hope to be therto restored.</p>
            <p>¶Whan the emperour Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der had concluded these thynges with his owne counsaylours, he soone after came into the senate, and there recited in an eloquent and sobre oration, the sayde articles, declarynge what feruent desyre he had to saue the people of Rome, not onely agaynst outward hostilitie, but also agaynst in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde perylles and consumption of their bodyes by horrible syckenesses, whiche oration fynisshed, all the senate with teares in their eyes for gladnesse, in the name of them selues and the people, rendred most har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty thankes to the emperours maiestie. And forthwith without any exception or myslikyng of any one thing, they confirmed it by an act of the senate. And the next day the Tribunes assembled the people, and declared to them all that preceded: which they so ioyousely herd and receyued, that they ratified it with their common consentes with these acclamations. Noble Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we pray the goddis, that they haue no lasse care of your maiestie than ye haue for vs. Most happy be we that we haue you amonge vs. Noble Alexander, the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:574:55"/>
goddis preserue you, the goddis defende you, procede forth in your purpose. We oughte to loue you as our father, to honour you as our lorde, to meruayle at you as a god here lyuyng among vs. Therto they added: Noble Emperour, take what ye wylle of our treasure and substance, to accomplishe your purpose.</p>
            <p>¶The emperour heryng of this lyberal offer, caused to be answered in his behalfe, by Frontine his Pretor, The emperour thanketh you, but nothynge wyll he charge you with, touchyng the buyldyng and furnys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyng of the sayde .iiii. hospytalles, for he wyll doo it of his owne treasure: only two thynges he requireth of you, whiche shall not be burdeynous to you. Fyrst that ye ceasse not to pursue and obeye continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all the sayde statutes and ordynaunces. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, that ye wyll be content, that suche common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues, whyche seeme to hym vaynely employed and agaynste the weale publyke, maye without any grut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge of your parte be layde to the mayntenance of the said hospitals. Therat al the people eftsones with one voyce cryed: Do noble emperour what shall seme to you good. For your most blessid nature can not erre or do amysse any thyng that ye purpose. Hereat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour reioycing, and remembrynge that longe tyme before, he thought that the playes callyd <hi>Florales</hi> and <hi>Lupercales,</hi> and the abhomynable ceremonies of Isis (in the which were shewed by men and women naked, moste abhomynable motions and tokens of lecherye) were prouokers and nouryshers of beastely vice: he therfore by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the senate, abolyshed the said playes and ceremonies. And the reuenues, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the mayntenance of them being very great,
<pb facs="tcp:574:56"/>
he appoynted to lay them vnto the sayde hospitalles, with some part of his owne possessions, which he had purchased. Fynally the sayd foure hospitalles within the space of one yere were buylded on the ryuer of Ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bet in the moste ample and magnifike facion: so that all the chambers of the syck people were so made, that the floores of them were .x. fete aboue the ground, and distant one from an other .xx. feete, euery chamber ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng his bayne, and freshe water conuayed into eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them by a cundyte, their places of easement ouer the ryuer, the wyndowes lyeng north &amp; northest, the floores of great thyck plankes close ioyned, in the nether story were the sellers, larders, wardropes, and suche other offyces. At the south syde were lyke many chambers, the wyndowes opened towarde the north, the kytchyns and lodgynges of offycers &amp; minysters, whyche shulde serue the sycke men were at the weste ende. At the east ende hauing a prospect into the north was the ware houses, which serued for medicines, to theym were ioyned the lodgynges of the apoticaries, phisitions and surgeons, and they were ryghte fayre &amp; honestly furnyshed. Of no lasse magnificence were the two hospitals in the citie, but rather more costely, wherby the beaultie of Rome was moch augmented. These thynges being stablysshed, the senate toke on them the gouernance of them, appoyntyng euery yere by lotte ten senatours to be therof surueyors and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers of all the offycers and other mynysters. And the same senatours at the ende of theyr yere to make accompt openly to the Tribunes and people, of the im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ployment of euery parcell of the sayde reuenues. And yf any were founde in arrerage, he shulde be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:574:56"/>
immediately to pay to the treasory of the sayd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spytals foure tymes as moch as the arrerage amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Fynally so moche commoditie hapned vnto the citie of Rome by the sayde hospitalles and other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces before rehersed, that within very fewe yeres after, no fowle syckenes was perceiued to be in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nor ydell person, by occasion wherof a great parte of the chambers in the sayde hospitalles were vacant and moche of the reuenues were saued: whiche being brought to the common treasory, afterward eased the people of taxes in tyme of warre, to their no lytle com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fort and quietnes.</p>

And by the example of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus the emperour, he reported to the hole senate ones in a moneth, suche thynges whervpon they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, with the principall reasons whyche therto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, whiche if the more part of the senate sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably

And to the intent he wold not haue his labours &amp; the authoritie of the senate frustrate by the lacke of execution (Not withstandyng that he had many espialles as I sayd before, to awaite the defau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of officers) he vsed many tymes to dysguise him selfe in diuers strange facions, as somtyme in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of a scholer of philosophye, comen out of Grece, and speakyng nothing but Greke, which he dyd most exquisitely, oftentymes lyke a marchant, come out of Siria, or Persia, whiche had than but one language, and that spake themperour naturally, for as moch as he was borne in Siria. And hauinge with him one or two men of that countrey, which he dyd counterfaite, he lyke a scholer or seruant wolde one day haunte one parte of the citie, an other day an nother parte: And most politikely fynd occasion to se the state of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with the industry or negligence of them that were officers, whiche progresse he wolde neuer dyscouer to any man, but only to Ulpian, or one or two mo of his most secrete counsaylours or seruantes, neither before that he began it, nor after, and to them that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied hym, he commaunded, that they shoulde kepe it euer secrete, as they wolde auoyde his moste greuous displeasure. And in dede durynge his lyfe, it was by them neuer dyscouered. But sometyme he coulde not so escape vnknowen, but that he was sometyme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued. but dreadyng his seueritie, they that met with hym, and knewe hym, darste not salute hym, or make any sygne of knowledge vnto hym. But whan that they had dysclosed it, all they that herde it, examyned
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:574:57"/>
theyr owne actes, and al they, which at that tyme had done any thyng worthy to be reproued, liued in dreade lokynge to be therfore corrected, or at the leest wayes blamed.

            <p>¶After that he had reduced the citie to this honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state, he than by the aduise of his most discrete cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>saylours, ones or twyse in the weke, vsed to solace out of the citie, with a great company with hym of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable personages. for he neuer shewed hym self openly as Emperour, but with a greate and honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, aboue any other kyng of the worlde, albeit than he expressed a meruaylous familiaritie to all men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, that lyst to approche hym, without repulse to any man being in honest vesture, and not dyseased with infectiue syckenesse. In this solasyng he hunted the harte, the wylde bore, or suche as be callyd Alces, brought for the nones out of the great woddes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>many, whyche be in quantitie higher and longer than any oxe. He hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted also oftentymes the beare, but that neuer sauyng only whan he was in the partes where they were bredde, saying, that forasmoche as the beare was of his nature a deuourer of cattel, he desyred not to haue of that kynde in those places where cattell is nourished. In huntyng these beastes he sometyme on horsebacke proued his strength, sometymes shotyng, otherwhyles castyng at them iauelyns, whiche serued for that purpose. Oftentymes he onely behelde other
<pb facs="tcp:574:58"/>
yonge gentylmen huntynge, whyche he deuyded into sundry companies, and appoynted to theym a numbre certayne of arowes or iauelyns, to the intent that one shuld not be more exercised, or take more solace in hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyng than an other. The lyons, lybardes, tygres, pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and other lyke straunge and furyous beastes, he had in great numbres, whiche were kepte onely to thintent that at certayne tymes in the Amphiteatre, &amp; other lyke places in the citie ordeyned to the purpose, the people mought take plesure in beholdynge them, &amp; also seyng som such desperate persons, as wold auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their lyues, fyght with some of the sayd beastes, or one beast to fyght with an other. But neuer wolde he lette any gentylman Romayne to do any suche bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayl, sayeng, that he estemed none so lytel, that he wold put hym in daunger for suche a beast, whose body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge deade, was nothynge profytable.</p>
            <p>¶He toke also pleasure to hunte the falowe dere, the too, &amp; the hare with greyhoundes, inforeyng his horse (wherein he moche delyted) to gyue as many tournes to the game that he hunted, as the greyhoundes shuld do, And in that pastyme hauyng to euery beast of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery but two dogges at the moste, he contended with many other yonge gentyl men on horsebacke, whiche were by hym selfe onely appoynted, to shew hym selfe mooste delyuer and redye to incountre and checke the game at the moste aduauntage, wherin was a ryght pleasant and also profytable exercyse, shewynge a vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage or representation of a skyrmyshe in warres, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially whan he hunted the hart, and the bestes named Alces. For thanne there required to be shewed moche strength and hardynes, and in the pursuite labour &amp;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:574:58"/>
peynfulnes. And in this solace he vsed moche prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For they whiche one day hunted with hym, shulde not hunt the next day, but behold other hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyng, and mark diligently the lacke of theym that hunted in to moche haste or slownes, to thintent that they mought refrain such defaut. And they that dyd best were praysed. And by hym that was the prouost of hunting, it was rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in the emperours presence, howe many tymes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man was commended, to the intent that as rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of capytayns and petite capitaynes were voyde in any of the emperours garrisons, they which in the sayde huntynges were iudged mooste actife, yf other good maners were in them founden accordyng, shuld be preferred to suche roumes after theyr merites. But alway this good emperour had a vigilant respecte to the fourme of their lyuynges, and aduanced no man sodaynly, but with longe delyberation and good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uysement.</p>
            <p>¶Moreouer not withstanding his huntyng or other recreation, he neuer wolde let any day passe, withoute eyther consultyng some thynge for the weale publyke, or gyuyng some true sentence in iugement, or redyng som place in good authors, to augment his wysedom, or wrytyng some story or other thyng worthy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, he was suche a nygard of tyme, that he was meruaylously greued, yf he spente any daye in solace without doinge of any of those thynges that I haue reherced. Not withstandyng that in the meane tyme, all the affaires of the empire were treated and ordred by men assured good and faythfull, whome he knewe wel wolde not be corrupted. And whan nede required, he herd matters before it was day, and prolonged the
<pb facs="tcp:574:59"/>
tyme vntyl it were late &amp; within nyght. And not with standyng he neuer shewed countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of werynes, ne to be in any parte frowarde or angry: but had alwaye one maner of visage, and in all thynges semed merye and pleasant. Undoutedly he was of an excellent pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as in whom no man could fynde any lacke, and of so redy a wytte, that if any man merily wolde taste hym with a prety taunt, he shuld shortly perceyue that he vnderstode hym. After the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune affaires as well ciuile as marciall, he gaue the more parte of his study to the readyng of greke authors, redyng the bokes of Plato of a publyke weale. And whan he wolde reade any latin bokes, he rad specially the bokes of Tulli, of a publike weale, and also his offices. Sometymes he radde oratours and poetes: amonge whom was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus Ammonicus, whome he knewe and fauoured, and also Horace. He radde moche the lyfe of the great Alexander, whom specially he folowed, not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng he abhorred his drunkennes and crueltie.

But with great difficulty mought he perswade him to take that iourneye, he allegynge by dyuerse argumentes, that it shulde be more necessary, that he continued his preachynges and lessons, where a greate parte of the people were all redy informed in the chrystian faythe, and dayly increased, and waxed desirouse of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of diuine misteries, than goinge to the citie of Rome, where abounded al vice, pryde and tyranny, there to sowe preciouse sedes, as it were in the sand, or to gyue orient perles to swyne. Yet fynally whan the byshoppe and other sage personages had credybly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed hym of the moste excellent vertues of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour Alexander, and in what sorte he had reformed the state of the citie of Rome, he condescended to goo thyther. whiche beinge intimate vnto the Prouoste of
<pb facs="tcp:574:61"/>
Egypte, he accordynge to the Emperours commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, prouyded for hym a shyppe with all thynges necessary vnto his iourneye. And bycause he behelde hym symply apparayled, he ordeyned for hym sundry garmentes in the moste honest sort that philosophers than vsed: but Origene wolde not receyue any parte therof, not so moch as hosen or showes, but lyke as he alwaye accustomed to go from his chyldhode (that is to saye, in a syngle garmente of clothe and barefoted) so went he to Rome. And whan at his arriuayle there were brought vnto hym a mule and a chariote, to ride in the whiche he beste lyked, he answered, that he was moche lasse than his maister Chryste, which rode but one daye in his lyfe, and that was on a sely asse mare. Wherefore he wold not ryde, except he were sycke or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepite: so that his leggis mought not serue him to go.</p>
            <p>¶The Emperour and his mother herynge of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge of Origene, caused hym to be brought in their presence, where he accordyng to his duety ryght hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly saluted the emperour knelynge, but the emperour with mooste gentylle countenaunce imbraced hym, and inforced hym to stande on his feete.

            <p>¶And whan the emperour had beholden his natyue grauitie, and most assured countenance, he in his hart iudged hym to be a reuerend personage. Than deman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded he of hym, what thyng he professed. He answered, Ueritie. The emperour asked of hym, what he mente thereby. He sayde, It was the worde of the lyuynge god, whyche was infallyble. The Emperour asked, which was the lyuyng god, and why he so called hym.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:574:61"/>
Origene answered, That he dyd put that distinction for a difference from them, whome men beinge longe drowned in errour dyd calle their goddis, whome they confesse to be ones mortall, and to haue dyed. but the god, whom he preached, was euer lyuynge, and neuer dyed, and is the lyfe of all thynges that be, lyke as he was the creator of them.</p>
            <p>¶And whan the emperour had required hym to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the vnitie of God the creatour, he deuoutly lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng vp his eyes, after a short meditation, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable and mooste compendious eloquence, he forthwith opened that mystery in suche wyse, that as welle to the emperour and his mother, as to all other standyng about theym (of whom I Eucolpius moste happily was one) it semed that we were brought oute of a longe slepe, and than dyd we se thynges as they were in dede, and that whiche before we esteemed and honoured were but vain dreames and imaginations. Yet themperour after a lyttell pause, sayde vnto Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene, that he moch meruayled, why men of such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull knowlege, shulde honour for God, a man that was crucified: being but of a poore astate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.

And for this cause the Atheniensis, haue euer sens had the name of Codrus in reuerence, and as all men do think worthily and not without reason. Nowe than consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der most excellent prynce, howe moche more worthy, with what greatter reason and bounden duetie ought we and all men to honour Christe, being the sonne of god, and god, who not only to preserue mankynd from daunger of the deuyll, his auncient ennemye, but also to delyuer man out of his dark and stynkynge don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of errour, beinge sente by god the father frome the hyghest heuens, wyllingly toke on hym the seruile garment of a mortall body, and hydyng his maiestye, lyued vnder the vysage of pouertie, and finally not of his ennemyes immediately, but moche more agaynste reason, of his owne chosen people the Iewes, vnto whome he had extended benefites innumerable, and after his temporall natiuitie were his naturall people and subiectes, he quarellyng with them, by declaryng vnto them their abuses, and pryeking them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dygne rebukes, at the last he was not slayne with soo easy a death as Codrus was, but in most cruel facion was scourged vntyll no place in his bodye was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out woundes, and than had a crowne of long &amp; sharpe

And not withstandyng all this tourment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, he neuer grudged, but lyftyng vp his eyes vnto heuen, he prayed with a loude voyce, sayinge: <hi>Father forgyue them, for they knowe not what they do.</hi> This was the charitie moste inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable of the sonne of God, employed for the redemption of mankynde, who by the transgression of Adam the fyrste man that euer was created, was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prisoner by the deuyl, that is to say, kept in the bondage of errour &amp; synne, from the actuall vision of goddis maiesty, vntyl he were in this wyse redemed, accordynge as it was ordeyned at the begynnynge.</p>
            <p>¶At these wordes of Origene all they that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent were wonderfully astonyed, and therwith the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour with a sturdy countenance said vnto Origene: Ye haue wonderfully set forth a lamentable hystorye, but yet notwithstandyng therin be thynges dark and ambiguous, whiche do require a more playne decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For what maketh you bolde to affyrme, that Iesus, whyche in this wyse was crycyfyed, was the sonne of god &amp; god, as ye haue called hym?

The ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles &amp; answeres of them, whom ye vntruly cal goddis, do remayne in confirmyng this testimony. And whan Origene had sayde all this, he forthwith began there, and disclosed the aunsweres of Apollo made at Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos, affirmyng Iesus to be God. afterwarde he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyted and declared the prophecies as welle of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues as of the Sybilles and other.

Heliogabalus helde you in suche captiuitie, that partely to auoyde his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, partely to flatter hym and get somewhat of hym, ye not onely suffred hym to abuse your wyues &amp; your chyldren, suche as beste lyked hym, but also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaced your bordell houses, and with open eyes lette your wyues and your chyldren dayly and nyghtely to haunte them. And openly in the stretes (whiche I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre to reherce) to apprehende men, and prouoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lechery. I omytte for the shortenesse of tyme many suche other elections, whiche haue proceded of your grosse and presumptuouse wyttes, after that ye hadde transgressed the order, wherin Romulus left you, and exceded the termes of your offyce or duetie: whiche at the laste was perceyued by you (as I dydde suppose) whan ye beinge tediouse of that beastely lycence, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che that beaste Helyogabalus gaue freelye vnto you, had slayne hym, and toke me to be your emperour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe with all my power I refused that bourden, vntyll I was by the Senate and you constrayned to take it. And than desyred you me, to reduce the state of this citie vnto the fyrste order. Wherabout I haue trauayled these eyght yeres, with not a lyttell payne, study and labours: begynnynge at myne owne hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, to thintent that as well by the exaumple of my seruauntes and officers, ye and other being vnder my rule, mought the soner refourme your selues, as also
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:574:72"/>
that ye mought the better perceyue, and be lesse offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyd with my seuerytie. And bycause I dyd se moch til example procede of the Senate, also that ye were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with the pride and corruption of iuges and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, I vsyng moche diligence weeded them out, and discharged them of theyr authoritiesme they went not vnpunished accordynge vnto theyr merites.</p>
            <p>¶ I purged also the state of gentylmen of ribauldes and riottours, and aduancing thervnto other, I cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to be dayly exercised in actes of prowesse, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elles to here lessons in such maner of doctrine, as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they mought acquire more wisedome, to be officers or counsaylours in the weale publyke. Onely the state of the people I dyd not visite, sauynge in punishment of theues, for as moche as I iuged that ye had leaste lybertie to do any great yuell, beinge (as I sayde) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with tyranny. And that those vices which were amonge you, lyke as they were taken by the example of your superiours, so trusted I, that by theyr punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, the sayde yll maners shuld be forsaken, and by the vertuous example of suche honest men as I haue put in theyr places, good maners shulde be as glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbraced. But nowe I perceyue all hath hapened contrary to myne expectation. for the sparinge of you, and the correction of my seruauntes, with the sharpe reformation of the senate &amp; gentylmen, hath broughte you vnto suche a presumption and arrogance, that ye contend to be equal with gentilmen, vsing no fourme of reuerence vnto them, eyther that ye thynke, that I feare more your purssaunce, than I fauour theyr ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesties: or elles that your rychesse doo make you soo proude, which ye abusyng in excessiue vseries, ye ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with

deuoure the patrimonies of many yonge gentyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and haue made them beggars, or by the seuery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the auncient lawes of this citie, taken theym in bondage and slayne theym in irons. And by suche co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable rauine, ye haue bought great possessyons in Grecia, Sicile, and Spayne, wherby ye accumulate treasours and pleasures lyke to great prynces. If ye thynke me to be aferde of your puissaunce, your opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is false. for aboue all thynges I mooste desyre to dye for the defence of the weale publyke of this noble citie: and in dede rather wyll I dye, than see the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities whiche nedes muste ensue thervnto, if order be not kepte, as I before haue declared.</p>
            <p>¶At that worde all the people cryed with one voyce pouryng out teares from their eyes, Lyue most noble and gracious emperour, he that wolde your death, let hym dy, let hym be rent into pieces. our puissance shall not annoye you, but vnto dethe shall defende you. ye haue restored vs vnto lyfe that were deed, vnto liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that were in thraldom, vnto honour that were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured.

And than eftesones they cryed. Lyue mooste gentyll and ryghtwyse emperour.</p>
            <p>¶Hereat the emperour relented, and with moch peyn retayned the teares of his eyes: And after that he had settled his spyrites and countenaunce, he spake than
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:574:73"/>
vnto theym in this wyse: I am well contente that ye haue declared, that there is yet in you some porcion of vertue, whiche gyueth me hope, that neyther the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble renoume of this citie begunne by Romulus, and augmented by other honourable gouernours, nor my labours in restoryng therof, whan it was decayd, and lykely to perysshe, shall falle into ruyne. But yf ye be constant in this affection, I truste that ryght shortely the publyke weale shall flouryshe, and that this cytie and people, shalbe in as moche estymation as euer it was in the tyme of any of oure progenytours.

Remembre, that lyke as if the state of senatours do decay, of the gentil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men are elected into the senate suche as be vertuouse: so ye that shall be founde equal to them in vertue, (for your substance onely can not make you gentylle) shall

be aduaunced to the state of gentylmen accordyng to rayson. Than consyder yf ye wolde not than also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite to be preferred in reuerence. Nothing shall more cause a man wyllyngly to do his duetie, than to think what he wolde require of him that is inferyour vnto hym.

Nowe haue I no more to say to you, but applye your selfes with good wylles to restore this citie to the auncyent and moste laudable order, as I shal endeuour my self by example and diligence to brynge it eftsoones vnto his perfection.</p>
            <p>¶Thus ended the emperours oration, and therwith he arose and departed, all the people poursuynge hym with this acclamation: The goddis immortall keepe and defend you most noble emperour. ye ar the crown of our glory, of our welthe and prosperitie: hated be he of goddis and of men that wolde you displeasure.

After that the emperour had herd and wel considered the wordes of Frontinus, wherby was set forth the ancient stocke
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:574:84"/>
from whens Fabius descended, his greate possessions and substance, the grauite of his personage, his great experience in sundry auctorities: the emperour dydde caste on Frontine a dyspleasant countenaunce, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he ceassed to speake, the emperour made aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere in this wyse.</p>
            <p>¶Howe moche hath your iudgemente deceyued vs Frontine? howe could ye this longe dissemble with vs? I had thought that ye had euer estemed the stock by the fruite, and not the fruite by the stocke. No man commendeth the boughes or braunches, bycause the stemme of the tree is great, longe, or streighte: but yf they be well spreadyng, thycke of grene leaues, &amp; well sette with good fruite, than men saye that tree hath a fayre toppe, that tree bereth good fruit. And although the tree be neuer so mysseshapen or croked, the owner wyl digge about it, and vse al diligence for to preserue it: but yf the stocke be neuer so fayre, if the bowghes be rotten or seate, the owner wyll shrede them, &amp; throw them into the fyre. If the frutte be vnsauery or withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who taketh any great hede of the tree? who wyll gather the fruite? but rather let them rotte on the tree or fall downe, for he careth not for them. Who loueth rotten groundsyll or poste, bycause that it was part of an auncient house? Who setteth by a ragged a resty or yll fauoured colte, bycause that the harreyse, whereof that kynde is commen two hundred yeres passed, wan the price of runnyng at the game of Olympus? I con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse, that long continuance in any thing that is good addeth an admiration, but no prayse to the thyng: all be it the thynge founden good, prayseth the contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or longe endurynge therof. A good chylde rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
<pb facs="tcp:574:85"/>
and also augmenteth the prayse of his parentes: the yll chylde raseth out of mennes hartes the fathers honour and benefytes. Also great possessions or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, maketh vertue suspected, bycause they be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysters of pleasaunt affections, and also nouryces of wanton appetites. Moreouer the grauitie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage is not proued by stately countenaunce or dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynfull sylence, but by constance in vertue, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des alway apte for the tyme and purpose. And experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whiche is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended by laudable actes, doth deserue no more prayses, than the gate of a blynd hors aboute a wyde horsemyll, whiche gryndeth no corne. And that olde capitayn, whiche in many batayles and iourneys hath ben founde alway negligent, deserueth no garlande. Many authorities do require an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site tryall, forasmoch as authoritie doth abate feare, &amp; minister boldnes, boldnesse draweth in licence, licence is mother of myschiefe, whyche nedes must be suffred vntylle fauour relenteth. These thynges consydered Frontinus, eyther your iudgement is not so perfecte as I wold haue taken it to be, or els ye secretely win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng at the sayd faultes, haue dissembled longe with me, and kepte thynges from my knowlege, contrary to your allegiance and duetie.</p>
            <p>¶With these wordes Frontinus beinge aferde, kne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe, and besought the emperour to pardon him of his foly, confessyng that he had not perfyte know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and maners of the said Fabius. but forasmoch as he had ben fauourable toward him and his frendes in his ministrations, he mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syred his aduauncement.</p>
            <p>¶Thereat smyled the emperour and sayde: Shall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:574:85"/>
this plage neuer ceasse, which in royalmes and cities hath so longe raigned? that mutual beneficence blyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth mens iudgementes. And whiles power with ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures getteth great acquayntaunce, vertue is vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and in the courte frendles. I knowe, Frontinus, that pryde in Fabius Macrinus is a domestical vice. For in all the house of Fabius it hath ben excedyngly noted, and in some hystories remembred. And in this man as well the remembraunce of his auncient nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as his long continuance in authoritie, hath more increaced it, as I my selfe haue marked, and also herd other murmurynge at it, whan I haue secretely wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the cytie in a pryuate apparayle. Wherefore I wyll not that he be in our counsayle nor palayce, that either his pride shulde be of yonge men folowed, or of olde men dysdayned, or of vs suspected. His greatte possessions &amp; ryches declareth, that he can not be with a lyttell contented, sens the more parte therof he hath gathered vnder the colour of his authorities, beinge not lefte vnto hym by his owne parentes, nor receiued of our lyberalitie, nor by the gyfte of our predecessors. And very seldome where honour increceth auarice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth. I hate not Fabius in the state that he nowe is, although I fauour not in him the said notable vices: but if he were ner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r vnto vs, we coulde neyther su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyne them, nor suffre hym vnpunysshed, yf he than vsed them. Also in his longe experience I neuer herde hym for iustyce commended: but I haue herde his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, his longe delayeng of suiters, and his parci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie, of many dyspraysed. Truely such a man is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mete to be a nigh cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sailour, nor to say the truthe in any great office. These thynges consydered Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,
<pb facs="tcp:574:86"/>
speake no more of hym, but serche for some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in whome synceritie and temperaunce be ioyned with wysedome. Suche one, yf he be of an auncient house, shall brynge to our palayce an honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of his noble progenitours, and as welle to noble as vnnoble shalbe an excellent patern or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydent. If he be but late come to worshyppe, his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement shall ingender in noble men an honest en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, eyther to excede hym in vertue, or at the leste to be iudged equall vnto hym. to poore men it shall be an allectife and roote of good hope, that they be in the ranke, where the rewarde of vertue is dealyd.</p>
            <p>¶And thus cessed themperour to speake. And Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus departed, being both ashamed of his enterprise, and abashed at the wysedome of his noble mayster.</p>

            <p>¶There was dwellyng in a village by Rome a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylman called Sextilius Rufus, whiche was ryghte
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:574:86"/>
well lerned in all partes of philosophy, and also in the sciences lyberall. But forasmoch as he consydered the frequent alteration of the weale publyke, with the ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyfolde peryls &amp; troubles in the administration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he of purpose withdrewe hym therfro as moche as he mought, although his father had bene a senatour in his lyfe, and he amonge his neyghbours and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the nobilite was had in good reputation. Not withstandyng for the causes before rehersed, and that he desyred nothynge so moche as quietnesse of mynde, and to solace hym selfe in the moste pleasaunt herbar of science, and vysityng the moste dylectable warkes of auncient wryters, he seldom came to the emperors court. or resorted to playes or bankettes, ne dyd come to salute the great offycers nor men in authoritie, as the vse was at that tyme. And amonge the yonge ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes he was not beloued, bycause he fauoured not theyr ryottous pastymes. And the men of lawe hadde hym in dysdayne, bycause he repugned agaynst their subtyll gloses, and blamed their auaryce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fynally he being fully content with the golden mean, liued right honestly in a manour, whiche he had competently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshed with possessions sufficient for the prouisyon of his meane household, whiche was to his neyghbours more bounteous than sumptuous.</p>
            <p>¶After that the emperour had pourged his palayce and the senate of vnworthy persons, corrupted with detestable vices, and with moche difficultie founde o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to set in their places: It hapned, that some good man named to hym Sextilius Rufus, declarynge the common report, whiche he had herde of hym. The em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who knew all to be true that was spoken, held
<pb facs="tcp:574:87"/>
his peace not withstandyng, harkenyng what shulde be other mens sentences. The more parte of theym, whiche were present, affyrmed, that Rufus for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestye wysedome and lernynge was mete to be of the senate, but thre or foure sayd nothyng. At the laste Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phenus a great lawyer, and in good estimation with the Emperour, obiected, sayeng, that Rufus not with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standynge that he was lerned in dyuers sciences, yet was he neyther profoundly lerned in the lawes ciuile, nor moche experienced in affayres of the empire. And that his lyttell husbandry and small prouision about the increace of his lyuinge, declared hym to be a man of no great polycie, nor of any dexteritie about thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of importance. And that the aptitude of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was only in studious meditation of sundry sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and in wrytinge more than in doing. Addynge to that philosophers were neuer good practysers in a weale publyke, nor yet good men of warre. Wherfore in as moche as he that is a senatour, not only oughte to be a man mete for polytike gouernance, as welle in gyuyng counsayle in matters therto pertaynynge, as also beinge chosen to be Pretor, or to any other myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of Iustyce, not to be ignoraunt in gyuynge iudgement in causes brought before hym: but also he oughte to haue some experience in marciall affayres, that beinge chosen consul, or leader of the hoste of the Romaynes, he mought se the men of warre to be well instructed and exercysed. And that in all thynges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longyng to warre, the state of the citie be sufficientlye furnyshed. Moreouer, that in battayle ioyned eyther by his ignorance or basenes of courage, the Romayn army be not dystroyed. These thynges con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yered, it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:574:87"/>
semed to him, that it was not expedient to receiue Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus into the number of Senatours.</p>
            <p>¶The emperour heryng Alphenus, and beholdynge that no man proffred to speake after hym, except three or foure mo, whyche were lawyers, and one Omnius Camillus a noble man, who had some dysplesaure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde Rufus for one of his seruantes: these seemed by their countenaunces to approue the sayeng of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phenus. That perceyuyng the emperour, he lokynge on Alphenus spake in maner as hereafter foloweth.</p>
            <p>¶I see well Alphenus, that not onelye the vulgare and vnlettered people be angrely stered and do retain displeasure agaynste them, whiche withoute malyce, do rebuke in a generaltie the vices and faultes, which be founden amonge them: but also (whiche I doo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) men specially chosen for theyr wisedome and ler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nynge, do disdayn them that rebuke the abuse of that study or exercise, whiche these wyse men most chiefelye haue haunted. I knowe that Sextilius in one of his bokes hath sharpely noted the detrimente doone vnto iustice by couetouse lawyers, whiche by theyr subtyll wyttes haue inuolued the lawes ciuile into suche ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and ambiguouse sentences, that noo man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theyr declarations, may knowe howe to do or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister iustice in cases, for the whiche the sayde lawes haue prouided. Nor they that make lawes can expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d them afterwarde without a lawier, whiche perchance was not fyrste priuie to the lawe makynge. These and lyke annotations of Rufus do not a lyttell offend you that be lawyars, althoughe ye haue abandoned pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise. And that dyspleasure onely hath caused you to make this conclusion, that Rufus is not mete to be of

Fyrst the diuersitie of sciences, where in your selfe doo confesse, that he is well lerned, dothe not disable hym to be a Senatour, but maketh hym more conuenient and necessary for so noble a counsail. For to whom doth it more apperteine to vse wordes in theyr propre signification, and to set them in order, so that they make not the sentence peruerse or doubtfull, than to a senatour, or one hauing rule in a weale pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke, and that is the thyng whiche grammer teacheth?<note place="margin">

The same citie had neuer a more noble Capytayne, nor a more valyaunt than was Pericles: who with Anaxagoras contynuallye studyed phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophye.

Polybius the philosopher, and in vacant tymes from battayle he either herd him rede, or disputed with him. Semblably Lucullus was so studyous in all kyndes of lernyng (as Plutarche writeth) that where he herd that any great lerned men disputed togyther, thyther wolde he go, and studiousely here them: and (as the the same author saythe) he haunted and imbraced all kynde of philosophy, with mooste familiar acquayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce and custome, specially that whyche was called <hi>Academica,</hi> or the doctrine of Plato. And was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a more noble, a more polytike or more valyant ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitayne, and more estemed and drad of moste puissant pryncis than he was? Lord god what a senatour was Cato called Uticensis? whose vertue was wondered at throughe the worlde, whose magnanimitie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable seueritie more profyted vnto the publyke weale of the citie, than the vyctories of Pompey and Cesar. And was not he so studyous in philophy, that he could not temper hym selfe, but that he must nedes rede Greke bokes, whan he satte in the senate? What consul can ye compare to Marcus Tullius, who only by his diuyne and moste excellent wysedome preserued the publyke weale and citie of Rome frome vtter sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercion, whiche nedes must haue hapned by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy of Cataline and his confederates, if it had not ben by the incomparable witte of Tullius found out, and by his diuyne eloquence playnly conuynced, and by his wonderful wysedome suppressed and cleane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynguyshed?

sage and honorable senatours, whiche were not onely excellent philosophers, but also prudente coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saylours and valyant capitaynes. yet wylle I reherce some, whiche were in the tyme of your remembrance. The emperour Adriane was so profoundely lerned in all philosophye, that he dysputed openlye at Athenes with the chiefe phylosophers of all Grecia, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quysshed Phauorinus, who at that tyme was of all other moste famous: and to what prynce or capytayn gyueth he place, eyther in marciall prowesse, or ciuyle gouernance? What more honor euer hapned to Rome than that Marcus Aurelius Antoninus succeded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Adriane, whose lyfe was confessed to be the moste certayne lawe vnto al people to rule or be ruled: And he for his exquisyte knowlege in all philosophye, was most commonly called Antonine the philosopher, not by reproche as som wold suppose it: but for a most excellent and rare commendation. And what man dyd euer more encreace the weale publike, or better defend, it, than dyd this most noble and vertuouse emperour? And be it of you receyued without suspition of boste, as it shall be spoken of me without any vaynglorye: I whiche may not be compared with the moste inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of them before named, eyther in lernynge or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse, yet howe moche I haue amended the state of the weale publyke, ye all can beare wytnesse: And that I haue nothynge appaired the imperial maiestie, it hath bene of the Senate and people in your presence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. And this coulde I not so well haue doone, yf I had not instructed my wytte with the doctrine of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.

            <p>¶And nowe to make an ende of this matter, wherin I haue taryed the lenger, to the intente that I wolde extirpate this vayne opynyon, whiche men haue had agaynste philosophers and theym that be studyouse. Trewely that which ye do note in Sextilius to be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell husbandry and small prouision, procedeth not by lacke of good policie, as ye haue supposed, but he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly doth neglecte to be riche or to aspire to any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie by ambition or flattery, preferryng temperate and sure quietnes, before daungerouse and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labours, and more estemeth to be an honest lyuer, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a malapert crauer. Also by his study in philosophy it seemeth that he hath acquired a great magnanimy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or noble courage, not extentynge the force of his wyt and knowlege in thynges whiche are but of lyttel importaunce: wherin he fareth like to the puissaunte grehounde, whiche was sente to the great Alexander by the kynge of Albany: vnto whom whan there was brought a great bul, he therfore wold not ones meue, afterwarde a myghty and fierce lyon, was lyke wise shewed to hym, whiche he onelye behelde and moued his tayle, but he wolde not therfore aryse oute of his place. Finally there was brought forth a meruaylous great olyfant: than stode he on his feete, and dyd sette vp his brystelles, and shewed his teethe, and beinge
<pb facs="tcp:574:92"/>
comforted by Alexander, he lepte to the olyfant, and byt hym, and after a fewe assaultes kylled him. Like wise Sextilius beinge contente with his astate, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not his wytte to augmente it. but if he be fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably called to thynges of greatter importaunce, and therin well comforted, I doubte not but that he wyll shewe, that his study hath not ben vaynely employed. I meruayle that ye doo not consyder, that authoritie and fauour not onely sheweth a good wytte, but also doth polyshe that whiche is rude. Fullars, taylours, horsekepers, and marinars, were by the Emperour Commodus, and my predecessour Heliogabalus, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to be Consules, Pretores, and Tribunes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as I herde saye were so chaunged in their wyttes, that it semed vnto them which knew them before, that sauynge theyr visage, and personage, they were alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and made other men, so moch in theyr wordes and procedinges they excelled aboue their accustomed wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, all mennes expectation.

Orpheus doth call lyfe, you and your progenytours haue called Father, as it were by a specyall preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue aboue all other, which name is agreable vnto his propretie. For of lyfe all thynges haue being and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, whyche acte of creation, or (more naturally to speke it) generation, is incident to the name of father. lyke as also his office is to preserue and kepe safe that which he him selfe hath ingendred. Consyderyng how inestimable an office and dignitie are included in that diuine and moste reuerende name of father, makynge me therby the mortall ymage of the lyuyng god: howe circumspect ought I to be, that I do nothing vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy that name so lyberallye gyuen me? Ye knowe well Paulus, that in mens chyldren be dyuers and sundry dispositions, some be apt of their nature to vertue and towardnesse, some haue not nature so prompt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolent, wherfore they must be by education thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to formed: some be quycke of wytte, some dulle in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie. of sharpe wyttes, some moste do resplendyshe in actes that be honeste, other seme quyckest in malyce and shrewdnes. The good and diligent father of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryche of them is equally carefull, and assayeth fyrste by education to make them all conformable vnto his appetite. And therfore at the fyrste with swete meates and praty gyftes he allureth them all for to loue hym, and where they offende (as none or els verye fewe are perfyte in vertue) correctyng them with a lytel sharpe rodde, he maketh theym also to feare hym. And yf he beate a shrewde boy, it is done as well to put other in feare to offende, as to make hym amende. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme the father to restrayne the prompte dysposition that he seeth in his chyldern to vicious qualites, doth
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:574:98"/>
abdicate nowe and than oone, that is to saye, putteth theym out of his familye, and clerely excludeth theym from any hope of inheritaunce. somtyme perceyuyng their shrewdnes to ceasse, yf any transgresseth ageinst hym selfe onely, eyther he correcteth hym moderately, or by a wyse and gentyl perswasion, assayeth to induce hym to knowe wel his duetie, and to plucke from him opinion of a fals libertie. Nexte vnto god, who is so great a father, as he which is father of a hole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey? that is to say, father of them that be fathers, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and family. Howe moche than ought the care of hym, excede farre the cares of all other? the charitie of hym, the loue of all other? the wysedome of hym, the prudence of other? The studyous father more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth howe to brynge vp his childern in honestie, than howe to lyue pleasantly. The louing father hath more solicitude aboute his chylderns helth, than about his owne welthe. The wyse father more considereth, what his sonne shall be in the estimation of other men, than howe he maye content his syngular affection. I haue shewed to you the office of a priuate father. What wyl ye nowe say to me, that in offyce am the vnyuersall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the hole countrey?

Than take good hede what I saye. The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of Iustyce, whiche ye seeme to note in me, in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshyng offenders against the weale publike, is but a forme of discipline, conuenient and necessary, hauyng regarde to suche chyldren as I found in this citie, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with al kyndes of vyce, and hauing their myn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des and wyttes all dysposed to foly, whyche beinge a

            <p>¶In offences touchynge our onely persone, we haue discended in our mynde from the imperyall maiestye, and considered our fyrst astate left vs by nature, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in lokynge as in a myrrour, we beholde the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that other men be of, and therin the sedes of sundry affections. this causeth vs where we fynde hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, in lamentyng the mysery of mankynde, to be meued with a fatherlye pytie, and moche lasse este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge the daungier of our persone onely, than of the hole countrey.

Not with standynge yf he be so malicious and arrogant, that he wyll not ceasse to abuse our pacyence, we than refuse hym to be our chylde, and as an enmye vnto the weale publike (for so be all that intendeth hostilytie agaynst hym, whiche is heed and father thereof) we commytte hym to the senate and people, for his malyce and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be iustely condemned.

And than the gentilmen of Campania, lefte their ancient frugality and diligent gouernance, and dyd sette all their study, onely about thynges ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and dilectable, not being contented with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the same countray, ne with the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and quantity, whiche they before vsed, but with outragious expenses, sending into other countreyes far of, for other kyndes of thinges which they had not growynge, they vnsaciably fed therwith them selues and their seruantes, &amp; contemnyng the exercise of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, they negligently haue suffred their seruantes to be oppressed with gourmandise, and to reiecte their accustomed fare, and to haue it more delicate.

Herof haue we to many examples, as well in the tyme of Tyberius, Nero, and Domitiane, as in the tyme of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. Were not Dulius Sillanus, and Antius Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pus, men of great honesty, condemned to dethe by the Emperour Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modus, vpon the false complayntes of their lybertines? whiche grutched agaynst them, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Sillanus was a sterne man, and of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient seuerytie. Wherefore they moughte not susteyne hym, punyshyng them contynually for their ydell and ryottous lyuynge. Lupus bycause he wold not suffer his lybertines to incroche vpon his possessions, and to retayn certayn portions of lande, which after the deth of Petilius Rufus his mothers vnkle (whose heyre Lupus was) they had taken by stelthe, whiles he was
<pb facs="tcp:574:102"/>
in Asia. wherfore they appeched hym vnto themperor, sayeng that he was of familiar counsayle with Caius Regilius, whom a lyttell before. Commodus had put vnto deathe. Petronius in the tyme of Caracalla the emperour, was also put vnto dethe by a lyke occasion. And to speake of myne owne experience, by the space of .xl. yeres, so longe I continued in kepynge of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry in the countrey of Umbria, hauing therin mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che delectation. I found the rustical people my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours prompte to iniuryes, murmurynge at Iustyce, grutchyng at labours, desyrous of pleasures, ingrate ageynst benefytes. At the fyrst I was with them fami<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyar and homely, than founde I them alway carlyshe and sturdy. than agaynst myn owne nature I chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my copy, and became towarde them more strange in countenaunce, more rare in speakynge, more selde in pardonynge, more quycke in reuengynge suche in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries as they wyllyngely dyd me.

Than consydered I wel, that good dettours oftentymes spared, become yll payers, small iniuries oftentymes pardoned, maketh of neyghbors pernycious enemyes.

seruantes. And of a mayster sturdy and fierce, a lyttell wynke to his seruant is a fearefull commaundement. The nature of libertines is moch contrariouse to that whiche is gentyll. The gentylman, gentilly intreated is contente to do all thynge: The vyle nature, famy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyarly vsed, grudgeth at euery thyng. This is euerye day proued, but no witte can make streight which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made croked. Geminus is a gentylman of an old house of the latines, whose great graundefather Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius Geminus was consul in the late dayes of the emperour Tiberius. He hath his possessions in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania (as I haue herde say) by an auncetour of his mother called Pomponius Sura. Perchance his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie there may be disdayned, and the moueable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lackyng somwhat of their wylles, may be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by some of equall degree vnto Geminus, by their exclamations to brynge hym out of credence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently vnto some ieoperdy. Wherfore serueth the Pretor Triphonius, who is knowen to be a man very discrete, well lerned, and of a great iudgement? if they came to hym, why dyd he not here them? If he wolde not here them, why complayne they not of hym? If he dyd here them, why is Geminus left styl vnpunished? If he be punyshed, why is he eftsones accused? Myn aduyse is moste noble Emperour, that Marcus Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus be hastily sent for, that he haue no leysure to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the Pretor Triphonius: and that immediately afterward a letter be directed to the same Pretor, wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng him to aduertise your maiesty with al expedition, what may be proued in the ratification of suche arty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as bene obiected in the accusation of Geminus: whiche proues beinge sente vp vnto vs, yf Geminus

can not refell them, than let the lawes of the citie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede agaynst hym. If the suggestion be founde false and malicious, than shall your maiestie do lyke a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous gouernour, and father of the countreye, yf by your excellent wysedom and rule of iustice, ye prouide that the fals accusers and their abbettours may be so punyshed that they and other persons of lyke inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be aferde to abuse your clemency and moste gentyll nature.

With that Duillius and Cotta being moche comforted towarde their purpose, to aggrauate the complayntes agaynst Geminus, and seming to do well, dispraysed the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tyrany of Geminus, and commended the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of his lybertines, sayenge, that they wolde not so soone haue complayned on Geminus, yf they had not ben by them vehemently styrred and prouoked therto.</p>
            <p>¶After that the emperour had ben a while in a study, as it were to say some thyng against Geminus, at the last with a familiar visage, he sayde vnto theym: Ye haue knowen in how moch detestation I haue alway had the oppression of innocentes, the iniuryes doone with extreme malyce and violence: And yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng the sharpe corrections, whiche haue ben exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted agaynst suche malefactours, as well by ancient lawes of this citie as by our owne decrees and ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, yet as it semeth that pestylence in the weale publyke ceasseth not. Wherfore we nowe wolde, that some newe and straunge correction were deuysed for Geminus, whiche shulde be suche as to al men of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree, it mought be the mooste fearefull example to offende in lyke condicion.

Forasmoch as the Emperour had referred the offence committed againste his maiestie, to the iudgement of the lawes ciuile, (albeit that suche punysshement were insufficient for such a traitour as Geminus was) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge his oppression of innocentes, his correction mought be no lasse than that he being al naked, shuld by his lybertines be fyrst of all whipped throughoute the citie of Rome with whyppes full of ruelles called Scorpions, and afterward his nose &amp; eares being cut of, so with reproches to be conuayde vnto the towne of his habitation, and there to be eftesones whypped by all his lybertines: and from thens to be caryed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iles called Nebrides, and neuer to retourne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Italye: his chylderne also to be banysshed for euer out of that territory: restitution also to be made to the

Who being retourned to theyr lodgynges, and sendyng for the lybertines and other of their acquayntaunce: after that they had declared what they had spoken, and how nigh the confusion of Geminus dyd approche, and what truste they had to enioye his goodes and possessions, there was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge theym ioye without measure, with reuelle and bankettyng, so that the reporte therof came to the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the emperour, and of al the Senate, whiche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in a great expectation of themperours iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:574:107"/>
Afterwarde the emperour commanded his place of astate to be made redy in the Theatre of Pompey, and that the people of Rome shulde be summoned to be redy there the thirde day folowing, whiche was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complyshed. And the emperour being set with his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble counsaylors with him, he commanded that as wel the libertines, as Duillius and Cotta shulde prepare theym to the accusation of Geminus, who came into the place, bryngynge with them one Rutilius Lupus a subtylle Rhetorician, to be theyr aduocate. But Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus onely trustyng on his owne conscience, refused to haue any other patrone, than the true examination and iustyce of the emperour and other, whyche were his iudges. And the Emperour was therwith ryghte well contented, consyderyng that the tyme of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersye shulde be made therby the shorter.</p>
            <p>¶First Lupus began his oration with a great praise of the Emperours vertues, whiche the Emperour in no wyse sustaynynge, but being therwith offended, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpellyd Lupus, and commanded hym to enter into his narration, and to declare immediately the state of the matter conteyned in the complaynte of the lyberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Than Lupus being partly abashed, for as moch as his begynning was to make themperor &amp; herers be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neuolent toward the libertines, &amp; to make the cause a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst Geminus to seme more greuous, he coldly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the matter, &amp; generally obiectid ageinst Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cus Geminus his familiar resort vnto Omnius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus before that he was detected of treson. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vnto he brought in for witnessis Duilliꝰ &amp; Cotta, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he callid men of gret worship, Geminus speaking yet nothing, nor changinge his countenance. Duillius &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:574:108"/>
Cotta by to moch malice &amp; couetyse, forgettyng them selues, preased furth, and sayd, that they had oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes sene Geminus not only at souper with Oniniꝰ in the tyme of his conspiracy, but also talking familiarly &amp; secretly with him. Therwith themperour taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of them, what it was that Geminus spake to Oninius. They sayd, they wyst not. for they stode farre from theym, and mought not here theym. The Emperour demaunded, if they dyd se whan Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus came and departed. They aunswered, that for the more part they came before hym, and abode longe after hym. He asked more ouer, in what fourme Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus departed from Oninius. They sayde, for the more parte with no pleasunt countenance of the one or the other. The Emperoure asked, if Geminus were desired by Oninius to come, or if he came to hym vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for. They sayd, they could not remember, but that Oninius sent alway a seruaunt for Geminus. The Emperour demaunded, if he dyd likewyse with them. They aunswered, no. The Emperour immediately sent for Oninius, who being reconsiled to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure, was than in the Senate, and for Carnilius his seruaunt, who had detected his treason: and in the meane tyme the Emperour turned hym vnto Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus and sayd, that if he were the man, that he shewed to be, he wolde lasse esteme deth than the losse of hys credence, and that for his parte he more estemed the confession of truthe, than the auenging of his disple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Wherefore he charged hym vppon the faythe of an honest man, to tell playnely, whereof was the communication betwene hym and Oninius. Gemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus answered, that the first accesse that he had to hym
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:574:108"/>
was voluntary and vnsent for, onely to salute hym, bycause he was a Senatour, and in greate estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not knowing any thynge of his trayterouse affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But perceiuing his qualities, and natural appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites not to be agreable to his opinion and study, he cessed to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, vntil he was desired of Oninius, which as he after perceyued, was for his incommodity. For Oninius desired of hym a mantion place, whiche he had ioyning to the gardeins of Nero, from the which he wold in no wise departe. All be it often and sundry tymes Oninius sent for hym, and as well by offrynge greate summes of money and frendship, as sometime by menaces, he assayde to gette of hym the house. but last of all he thretned hym, that hauynge all thyng at commaundment, as he doubted not but that he shuld see it comme to passe shortly, he wolde leaue hym nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther house nor life. With the which wordes Geminus sayde, that he was astonyed, and so departed with his displeasure. But yet not thinkinge, that Oninius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any conspiracy, considering that he was alied vnto the Emperour, and was by hym aduaunced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to greate riches. Thus ceassed Geminus to speake any more. And by that tyme Carnilius was commen, who beyng demaunded, what acquayntance he hadde knowen to be betwene Oninius and Marcus Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus: he aunswered, that he knew none acquaintance betwene them, but that often tymes he had herde O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninius his mayster saye to his secrete frendes, after that he had a longe tyme talked with Geminus, that he was a sturdy and obstinate persone, and wold not confourme hym to his requestes, concernyng a house which he had nygh to the cyty, wherfore if he mought
<pb facs="tcp:574:109"/>
brynge his purposes to passe, he wolde leaue hym nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther house nor heed on his shoulders. The Emperour demaunded, yf Geminus were any of them that Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius counsailed with concerning his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spiracy. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at smilid Carnilius and said, that Oninius neuer had hym in so moch reputation, for he euer estemed him to be moste vnapte to any suche practyse. Than came in Oninius, and the Emperour commaundynge hym, sate downe by hym: And themperour asked hym if he knewe Marcus Geminus. And he fearynge that he had complayned of hym, blusshed, and sayde, that he coulde neuer fynde kyndnesse in hym, and that his na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture was ouerthwart and alway agaynst his desires. Wherfore he desyred the emperour not to gyue to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che credence vnto hym in such thinges as he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of hym, other than touchyng the request made for his house in the citie, whiche he confessed to haue desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red importunately, and for that cause onely had often tymes conuented him wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he repaired into that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray. The emperour with that answere was wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and demanded, if he had any better opinion of Duillius and Cotta. He sayde, that they were of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sorte, and more confourmable vnto his appetite. Therat the emperour laughed in his hart (as he after declared vnto his familyars) markynge the folye as wel of Duillius and Cotta, as of Oninius Camillus, whiche vnwares had disclosed their secrete affections, and declared the innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of Marcus Geminus. And lycencyng Oninius to returne to the Senate, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Lupus to resort to the resydue of the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Geminus: who partly beinge discoraged, with a weake eloquence alledged the iniurie and cruell op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:574:109"/>
of Geminus, extended vnto his tenantes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng from them their auncient possessions, and anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xynge them to his dominycall landes. Therwith Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus being somwhat meued, playnly denyed that it was their ancient possessiooio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but affirmed that it were his proper dominical landes, which betwene the deth of his vnkle and his entrie, they had vniustely vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and falsely concelyd. Wherfore not only he by the law mought iustly expulse them from that which they vnlefully occupied, but also by their ingratitude they had forfaited their manumissions, and consequentely the landes gyuen to them by his auncetours of good ryght ought to resorte eftsones to his possession. This heryng the emperour, he demaunded of the complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes of what state and condicion they were? They all confessed, to be the lybertines of Marcus Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, and that suche landes as they had, were seruile. as for the whiche they were bounden to certayn obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances. But they plainly denied, that they had forfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any thynge, and with great exclamations, and out of order cryed out on Geminus. Than commaunded the emperour, that the gentilmen and residue of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines and tenantes, sent by Triphonius, shulde be brought in, who being in likewise examined, declared openly the stealynge of Geminus dominicall landes, by the sayd lybertines, whiche were accusers, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration of them to the distruction of Geminus, their priuie solicitation of other, the malicious supportyng of Duillius and Cotta, with their secrete confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and all other thynges as before they had shewed to the Emperour at home in his palaice: which aswel the accusers as Duillius and Cotta heryng dysclosed
<pb facs="tcp:574:110"/>
contrary to their expectations, they all were confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; in theyr amased countenance sodein and silence, semed to the emperour and al that were prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse their vntruthe and malyce. And therwith Cotta fearyng the emperours seueritie, fel on his knees, and besought the emperour to pardon hym, and lykewyse desyred Geminus to forgyue hym his malyce, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge all to be trewe, whiche was nowe spoken on his behalfe. Herewith the emperour was feruently styred with displeasure towarde the accusers: after that he had spoken with the resydue of the iuges, he gaue sen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tence in this wyse.</p>
            <p>¶ For as moche as it appiereth vnto vs, that thou Marcus Geminus art innocent of that treason, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thy cruel libertines, with the supportation of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illius and Cotta haue falsly accused the of, we declare the to be a true gentylman, loyall to the weale publike and maiestly imperiall, and denounce vnto all menne, that none be so hardy to renew this suspicion, wherof thou arte purged. And for thy pacience, wysedom, and temperance, we deeme the worthy to be admitted into the college of Senatours. Than the emperour tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng hym to the lybertines sayd: Ye vyllayn genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, full of pestyferous malyce, rude and most bestial of nature, voyde of all courtesy, false and deceyptfull towarde your souerayne, cruel and vengeable ageinst iustyce and raison: For as moche as ye with all youre wyl and puissance haue indeuored your selfes by your fals accusation, not onely to haue brought to a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deathe Marcus Geminus your naturall lorde, a true and innocent gentylman, and a necessarye mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of the wele publyke, which if it had hapned, therof

shulde haue succeded vnto the weale publike, notable damage, &amp; to our person perpetual reproche, &amp; burden vnto our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science: We therfore iuge you al worthy no lesse to suffre tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Duillius one of your captayns gaue in his sentence at home in our palayce agaynst Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Geminus. that fyrste ye shalbe whypped through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the citie with Scorpions, and than your noses &amp; eares to be cut of, and so to be broughte into Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and there to be eftsones whipped in euery towne, and last of al, to be hanged in chaynes on high gybet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as ye be .xvi. in numbre, in .xvi. of the gretest tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that countrey, and that your chyldren shall lose the priuilege of the manumissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of you and your aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours: and that none of your bloud be from hens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth manumised by any Consul or Pretor. Moreouer all your possessions holly to remayne to Marcus Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, your moueables by the consente of Geminus, (whervnto we exhort hym) to be equally diuyded and gyuen to his other tenantes and lybertines, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to be consentyng or party to your procedynges.</p>
            <p>¶Than loked he on Duillius and Cotta, and firste sayd to Duillius: Thou detestable serpente of villain progeny, which nature in the, neither mought be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with authoritie, nor altered with riches, for as moche as by enuy onely thou hast maligned ageinste Marcus Geminus, and with all thy power hast sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his libertines, to accuse hym mooste falsely of treson: &amp; more ouer thy selfe hast in such wise appeched hym, that in thine owne wordes it appereth that thou were of a more familiar resorte vnto Oninius than Geminus was, and by Oninius confession more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable vnto his appetyte, and what is declared by
<pb facs="tcp:574:111"/>
those wordes, but thou and Cotta were consentynge vnto the conspyracy? Thou shalt therefore receyue thine own iugement, which thou woldest haue gyuen on Marcus Geminus, that is to saye, thou shalt be disgraded of al honour, and despoiled of thy garmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in the myddel of this cyty: And from thense whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with scorpions vnto the hygh way called <hi>Via Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia.</hi> and from thense thou shalte be caried vnto Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum, and being there eftsones whipped, thou shalt be rendred with thy children in seruytude to Marcus Geminus. And al thy possessions to remayne for euer to hym and his heires. And as to the Cotta, although that thou haste desyred pardon, yet for as moche as thou haste polluted the noble and aunciente bloude, wherof thou camest, imbracing villayne condicions, and chosinge rather to be confederate with villayns and maliciouse wretches, than to fauour vertue and iustyce, it were not expedient that thou sholdeste be so pardoned, that thou sholdest clerely eskape without punishement, specially considering, that thy nobility was a cause that Geminus was moche more suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than if thou haddest not ioyned thy selfe with his libertines. Thou shalt therfore susteine parte of thine owne iugement, whiche thou woldest haue gyuen on Geminus, that is to say, thou shalt forthwith lose all thy moueables, whiche also with the goodes of Duil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius shalbe equally parted, the one half to be brought in to the commune treasorye, the other halfe to be gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen indifferently amonge those gentylmenne, whiche honestly haue declared vnto vs the innocency of Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cus Geminus. And as for thy landes, duryng thy life to be confiscate, afterwarde to retourne to thyne hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.

Moreouer that thou thy selfe shalt neuer retorne in to Campania, but remayne stylle here in this citye, excepte we vppon other considerations hereafter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge vs, shall clerely pardon the.</p>
            <p>¶This was the ende of the Emperours sentence. Wherewith all the people reioyced and cried with one voyce: happy is Rome, that hath such a gouernour, happy is the world, that it hath, such an emperour, but moste happy be we that haue such a father.

            <p>¶With these and other moste ioyouse acclamations, the emperour issued out of the Theatre and departed towarde his palayce, hauing with hym Marcus Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, all the streetes beinge full of men women and children, castyng before hym imnumerable roses and other sweete floures. The nexte daye was the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours iudgement putte in executyon, and Geminus admitted in to the Senate.
