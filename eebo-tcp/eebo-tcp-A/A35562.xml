            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F it lie upon every Chriſtian, in general; but, upon them principally, whoſe profeſſion is, to teach others, <hi>to be ready at all times, to give a reaſon of their hope, to them that ask: (1 Pet. 3.15.)</hi> that is, as I conceive, of every thing they <hi>believe,</hi> as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith: how much more doth it concern all men, to be well ſatisfied in themſelves, that what they believe, and wherein they place their confidence; though they can give good <hi>reaſon</hi> for it, and juſtifie the <hi>truth</hi> of it; will, or can do them any good? Certain it is, and it is a caſe fully argued and defined by St. <hi>Paul (1 Cor. 13.)</hi> that if one thing be wanting, the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, or moſt Orthodox Faith will do no good: and as certain it is, that whoever is guilty of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> doth want that <hi>one thing,</hi> without which no ſalvation can be had. For <hi>Schiſm</hi> doth exclude from the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church; to which <hi>Catholick</hi> Church onely, as a jointure ſettled upon it, by the Goſpel of Chriſt; the benefit of Chriſts redemption, doth belong.</p>
            <p>A ſtrong apprehenſion of this truth, ever ſince I begun to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my ſelf to the reading of ancient Fathers; as them, from whom, after the Scriptures, I expected a certain reſolution of all doubts and differences: thoſe words of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> among others, eſpecially, <hi>Separationis immaniſſimum ſcelus;</hi> by which he doth ſet out <hi>Schiſme,</hi> as the moſt horrid of crimes that can be committed by the wickedeſt of men; made me very inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into the nature of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> and very ſedulous to collect ſuch things, as I met with in my reading, whereby I might through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfie both my ſelf, and others, if occaſion ſhould be, that
<pb facs="tcp:61006:3"/>
no ſuch thing as <hi>Schiſm,</hi> either as a Proteſtant, in general; or, as a member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (which may well be called the <hi>Paragon</hi> of all Reformed Churches:) could juſtly be laid to my charge. What I had collected to this purpoſe, I have kept by me (as many other things:) not with any certain inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make it publick, but as I ſhould ſee great cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt confeſs, that ſome books of this ſubject, ſet out by Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, within theſe few years, which came to my hands, did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what provoke me by their confidence, which <hi>I</hi> could not but admire. But then, as thoſe came to my hands, ſo ſome <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers</hi> alſo, and other books of the ſame ſubject; as particularly, what hath been written by a Reverend Biſhop, then of <hi>Derry:</hi> and ſince him, by a worthy Knight, of this very County, where I live; in <hi>Vindication</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> particularly: which made me think my ſilence would be no prejudice to the cauſe.</p>
            <p>I might have thought ſo ſtill; but for two Reaſons. Firſt, I did obſerve by ſome very late books, ſet out by ſome of that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; even ſince our late happy Reſtoration; that as it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſaid of the <hi>Sardi,</hi> proverbially, <hi>Alius alio nequior;</hi> ſo they did ſeem to me, to ſtrive how to outgo one another in bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and impudency; (I am ſorry I muſt ſpeak ſo plain:) and ſtill, the laſt, ſeemed worſe, then the former. I ſpeak of ſuch as I have ſeen. For, others, there may be, beſides them; which, perchance, may deſerve a better teſtimony.</p>
            <p>However, I might have conſidered longer, but that about laſt Chriſtmaſs, a book ſent from <hi>London,</hi> came to my hands, of which I had heard ſomewhat before, but had not ſeen it, till then. The title is, <hi>Labyrinthus Cantuarienſis—being an Anſwer</hi> (ſo the title doth promiſe) <hi>to the late Archbiſhop of Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburies Relation of a Conference: Paris: 1658.</hi> We
<pb facs="tcp:61006:3"/>
might expect ſomewhat extraordinary, from one that durſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſuch a work. What is performed, I am very willing the Reader ſhould ſuſpend his Judgment, till ſome tryal. And my hope is, That among ſo many, yet alive, whom that great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and bleſſed Martyr, hath ſo greatly obliged; ſome will be found, who will make it their buſineſs, to vindicate him fully. In the mean time, finding that the Author, whether following the example of others; or himſelf, an example to others; hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by much confidence, and vilifying language, (whereof he is very plentiful:) to abaſe the credit of that work, which by ſtrength of reaſon, he ſaw was not feaſable; my zeal for the truth, which in the wrong done to that excellent piece, muſt ſuffer much; and particular reſpects, to the memory of the Author, whom I alſo ſhall ever acknowledg a benefactor; made me very deſirous of an opportunity, to make his adverſary known unto the world, till a further diſcovery be made by others.</p>
            <p>This opportunity, (beſides, that it was my chance, at that very time; for divers weeks together, by ſome bodily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, to be confined to my houſe; ſo that thereby diſabled for other duties, I had the more leiſure at home:) that ſubject, which I had in my thoughts before, I did think would give me. Some things I ſaw, would offer themſelves without ſeeking; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would be brought in, without much digreſſing from the main purpoſe; and the Reader, I thought, where ſo much affinitie of matter is, might think my pains as well beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the one, as upon the other. As my Title, ſo my chiefeſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is, <hi>The neceſſity of Reformation:</hi> tending to this, to prove that our ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> upon that ſcore, cannot be charged with <hi>Schiſm</hi>: contrary to that the Author of the ſaid <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> doth maintain, <hi>That Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
<pb facs="tcp:61006:4"/>
are Schiſmaticks, and no part of the Catholick Church;</hi> Chap. <hi>xi, xiii, xiv.</hi> of his <hi>Labyrinth.</hi> To prove that <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> we muſt either ſuppoſe, or prove that Church to have notoriouſly ſwerved from the truth of the Goſpel and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, in matters of Faith, of great conſequence to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Now the particulars being many, wherein they are lyable to this charge; to go through which all would be a long work, and perchance not ſo needfull; I thought, if I pitched upon ſome one particular point, and plainly evinced it, in that one, it would ſerve my purpoſe very ſufficiently. That one, I have pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the buſineſs of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> which in a manner, doth comprehend all the reſt, and which is the point now, generally, moſt in agitation; as the Reader may be more fully ſatisfied, if he pleaſe to turn to the <hi>11, 12, 86, 87, 91, 92.</hi> pages of the Book.</p>
            <p>That was the only point, by me intended at the firſt: and that makes a great part of the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> (more rightly, <hi>Labyrinth:) to the Lord Archbiſhop of Canterbury</hi> his Book, as may appear by the <hi>Contents.</hi> However, accidentally, two other points are handled, The <hi>mutilation</hi> of the Sacrament: (and that too, handled by the ſaid Author:) and the mariage of Prieſts. So that the very Subject principally aimed at, hath given me opportunity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. If any thing be brought in otherwiſe, yet I have reaſon to hope it will be acceptable, even for his ſake, whoſe memory all true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are ſo much bound to honor. One thing I muſt profeſs, that I have been very careful, to do his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie no wrong, by miſtaking or miſreporting his Senſe; and to that end, I have ſometimes, where I thought it moſt convenient, exhibited his own words at large, to prevent all ſuſpition.</p>
            <p>Beſides the <hi>neceſſity;</hi> I have ſome conſiderations of the <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances</hi> of <hi>Reformation:</hi> and this brought us to a conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:61006:4"/>
of <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> not intended againſt Papiſts; but to ſatisfy (if poſſible) ſome men among us, whom ignorant people look upon, as moſt <hi>zealous Proteſtants;</hi> but wiſe Papiſts have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I am ſure, (and I think it will appear by our diſcourſe:) to account their <hi>beſt friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much of the <hi>acceſſory.</hi> Now concerning my chief ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, a juſtification of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> in general: ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, may ſay, or think; What need of this, which hath been done by ſo many already? I might anſwer; It is that which is done every day; in voluminous comments, eſpecially: what is new, beſides the dreſs, and ſome alteration of method? but that men are men ſtill, and will prefer that which is new, (as the Poet of a <hi>new Song</hi>;) before that which is old, be it better or worſe; which right palats only can diſtinguiſh. The ſame may be objected to the adverſaries. What have they, that hath not been objected and anſwered, over and over, even <hi>ad nauſeam</hi>? Yet if there be that read them, becauſe they muſt have ſomwhat, that is <hi>new:</hi> then, <hi>new</hi> anſwers, if not abſolutely neceſſary, may hope for the ſame favour.</p>
            <p>But I will not make uſe of that Plea. I am not of that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that people ſhould be humord in their folly. I will judg no other: but it is contrary to my judgment, to buſie myſelf in ſuch an imployment. Though therefore the ſubject be very ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; yet I am much deceived, if much be not here, that will not be found elſewhere, upon the ſame ſubject. Even there, where I inſiſt upon common inſtances, as objections out of Scripture, and Fathers; the diligent Reader, may obſerve ſome difference. If it be otherwiſe (for I will not undertake to have read all, even later books, of this argument:) I deſire the Reader to be ſo favourable, as to believe, (he may do it truly; though <hi>I</hi> ſhall acknowledg it a great favour:) that <hi>I</hi> had no intention to deceive him, but was deceived my ſelf. Farewell.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is not anything that our Adverſaries (ſo I muſt call them in this cauſe, though in Chriſt the common Saviour, whom we and they profeſs, fellow-members and brethren) have more frequent in their mouthes, or which they make more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of, when they have to do with ordinary people, then this common ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That no ſalvation can be had out of the Church.</hi> It is a true ſaying, and well worthy their ſerious conſideration, who account it their chief buſineſs whileſt they live, <hi>to make their Salvation ſure.</hi> We ſhall make good uſe of it: it ſhall appear in due place: willing therefore we are to lay it as a foundation, and to begin with it. The reaſon is given by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and is obvious enough upon Scripture grounds: <hi>Totus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, caput &amp; corpus eſt</hi>: Chriſt and his Church; Chriſt is the Head; the Church his Body; no man can have any intereſt in Chriſt, but as he is a Member of his Body, <hi>which is the Church,</hi> the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> therefore pithily and brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Habere non poteſt Deum patrem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cypr. De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nit: Eccleſ.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>qui Eccleſiam non habet matrem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſalvation then out of the Church ordinarily; I ſay ordinarily, leaving God to the priviledge of his Omnipotency; as Chriſt in the like caſe anſwered, <hi>Mar.</hi> x.27. So ſtill we keep to this main foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, <hi>That there is no other Name under heaven given among men, whereby they may be ſaved, but the Name of Chriſt:</hi> Act. iv.12. But what other way or ways God may have to bring men to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61006:7"/>
of Chriſt available to ſalvation, doth not become us to enquire, much leſs to determine: <hi>For the ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God; but thoſe things which are revealed belong unto us and to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> Deut. xxix.29. But this by the way onely.</p>
            <p>That by the <hi>Church,</hi> in this aſſertion the Catholick Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that alſo is generally acknowledged, ſince no particular Church can pretend unto Chriſt, but as it is a member of the <hi>Catholick</hi>; which Catholick Church our <hi>Creed</hi> doth oblige us to believe, as a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal point of Chriſtian Religion. But St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is very expreſs, when he ſaith, <hi>Extra Eccleſiam Catholicam totum poteſt (quivis,</hi> ſcil. though he ſpake there of one particular man; but it is the ſame reaſon of all:) <hi>habere,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>Out of the Catholick Church, all things beſides may be had. A man may have honor; (honorem:</hi> that is, promotion Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical; alluding to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v.17. and <hi>Heb.</hi> v.4.) <hi>a man may have the Sacraments; he may ſing Allelujah; anſwer Amen; be perfect in the Goſpect</hi>; (or perchance, <hi>perform the part of an Evangeliſt, or Goſpel reader in the Church:) have Faith in the Name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt; and preach it; but ſalvation he can find no where but in the Catholick Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the queſtion is, what title the Roman Church hath to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church,</hi> more then any particular Church? They will not ſay, That the Roman Church, as it is a particular Church (which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg) is the Catholick Church. No, they profeſs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and it would be too groſs an abſurdity if they ſhould ſay other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But as the Roman Church is the <hi>root,</hi> or <hi>center of Unity,</hi> as it <hi>doth infuſe Univerſality</hi> into other particular Churches; (a ſtrange ſpeech, and opinion!) and again, (<hi>Privilegio Dignitatis &amp; Dominationis, quia ſub ſe continet univerſas Eccleſias:</hi>) as God, ſaith one of the Popes, may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be called <hi>Univerſalis Dominus, quoniam omnia ſub ejus dominio continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur: Univerſal Lord, becauſe all things are under his dominion, (Decr.</hi> 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 99. a ſtrange ſpeech that too!) So the Romiſh Church is ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Univerſal,</hi> or <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Truly, I think it may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contradiction in the terms, be ſo ſtyled, if this be true, in all, or in part, that is alledged; but how truly or probably ſaid or alledged, beſides what by others, againſt it, fully, ſolidly, which can never be anſwered, hath been oppoſed, let the Reader judg, by what we ſhall have occaſion to ſay of it, though not intended purpoſely, but as it comes in our way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61006:7"/>But beſides this allegation, which hath been mentioned, (of the truth whereof, the Reader, as I ſaid before, may be able to judge by what we have to ſay;) I will acknowledge, and it may give ſome ſatisfaction to them that have not obſerved it, that the Roman Church may be called the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> (it is ſo by ſome ancients:) in another ſenſe, or reſpect, by a <hi>Catachreſis</hi> or <hi>Homonymia</hi> of the word <hi>Roman.</hi> Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, <hi>Romanus Orbis,</hi> or <hi>Romanum Imperium,</hi> becauſe of its great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and generality, was uſed by many in ordinary language as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding an <hi>Abſolute univerſality.</hi> Paſſages of ancient Heathen Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, are obvious to this purpoſe, which by learned Philologiſts, though upon another occaſion, have been obſerved. Nay the very word <hi>Romania,</hi> or <hi>Romanitas,</hi> hath been uſed for the whole World; that only, which they called <hi>Barbaria,</hi> or <hi>Barbaricum,</hi> excepted. <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na dominatio, id eſt, humani generis,</hi> ſaith the Epitomizer of the Roman ſtorie, <hi>Florus.</hi> Why not then <hi>Romana fides,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> in this ſenſe, for <hi>Catholica.</hi> Now as it would be impertinent, to inferre that all <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> were <hi>Greeks</hi> properly, and none but they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <hi>Graeci,</hi> is ſo uſed in the New Teſtament, and elſewhere; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Helleniſmus</hi> likewiſe: or that all Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are <hi>French-men,</hi> or <hi>Franci</hi> properly, and none but they, becauſe ſo called anciently by the Turks; as is well known, and hath been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by divers: ſo if in this ſenſe <hi>Romana fides,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> be uſed by ſome ancients for <hi>Catholica fides,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſia</hi>; to inferre upon it, that therefore he that is a true <hi>Catholick,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, how can it be leſs than a groſs and abſurd miſtake?</p>
            <p>The next thing which we ſhall ground upon, and will be granted on all hands, is, That one particular Church may have juſt cauſe of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in external Communion from another particular Church, and not be guilty of any Schiſm. The chief cauſe generally acknowledged, is, falſe Doctrine, in matters of Faith, not abſolutely fundamental; for that would make it no Church: but material in point of truth and ſoundneſs of doctrine, and not of an indifferent nature. But there may be other juſt cauſes too; as, unjuſt uſurpation upon rights and liberties: As alſo corrupted diſcipline and a ſcandalous life publickly maintained, and allowed by authority.</p>
            <p>And here I deſire to propoſe a Caſe to the Intelligent Reader. In
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61006:8"/>
the year of the Lord 795. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the VII. Son of <hi>Leo</hi> the IV. Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> having unhappily ſettled his affections upon one of the Ladies of the Court, was divorced from his lawful wife, and ſhut her up in a Monaſtery. He pretended, that his Wife had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to poyſon him, and otherwiſe too laid plots, to put him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the government. This he pretended, but nothing of it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; Neither indeed was there any thing of probability in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. However, he did what he could to get ſome of the Church on his ſide. He attempted the Patriarch, and others in dignity, but could not prevail. Yet, one <hi>Joſephus</hi> a Prieſt, an <hi>Oeconomus</hi> of the great Cathedral in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was found, who performed all ſolemnities and countenanced the buſineſs with ſuch credit as he had. All good men were much ſcandalized at the buſineſs. <hi>Tharaſius</hi> the Patriarch (though a man that had been promoted to that dignity contrary to the Canons of the Church, <hi>per ſaltum</hi>) particularly. But among the reſt, or indeed above the reſt, <hi>Theodorus Studita</hi> (a man of great fame in thoſe days, for his piety and learning; whom therefore the Emperour did endeavour to win to him, by all poſſible means;) appeared ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that he made bold, being no more in dignity then Guardian of a Covent, barely, to excommunicate the Emperour, and all that ſhould adhere to him in this cauſe. <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith, it was not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect excommunication, neither indeed was it at that time: but afterward it came to a direct excommunication: it was upon the ſame occaſion, though not of the ſame Emperour. But <hi>Baronius,</hi> who would have it the Popes peculiar priviledge, takes no notice of it; there were others that joyned in that action; as particularly one <hi>Plato</hi> of great fame, and piety, he alſo Guardian of another Monaſtery. <hi>Theodorus</hi> his own brother alſo, <hi>Joſephus</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> held with him; But by the progreſs of the ſtory, from the beginning to the end, it doth clearly appear that <hi>Theodorus</hi> was the principal actor and author who gave life and countenance to all that was done. This act gave great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to divers; who otherwiſe had ſufficiently declared their diſlike of the Emperors unlawful marriage. So that even among thoſe that were of one opinion in the main buſineſs, there became great diviſion, and indeed apparent, if not Schiſm, yet ſeparation. Great arguing there was (all which may be read in <hi>Baronius</hi>:) whether it were lawful to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate but for matters of Faith and Doctrine: how far number was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61006:8"/>
conſiderable to the conſtitution of a true Church (the paucity of them that adhered to <hi>Theodorus</hi> in this act, being that which gave moſt offence) and other like matters. But <hi>Theodorus,</hi> though he ſuffered very much in his body for it, as impriſonment, and ſtripes, and the like: yet he ſtood with an invincible courage to what he had done; and did not ſuffer in his body more conſtantly, than he did plead for himſelf with his pen, ſtoutly and reſolutely. I will not take upon me to juſtify, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his proceeding, nor all his reaſons, though much advantage may be made of ſome of his words: but that is not my aim, at this time. My obſervation is (and I ſhall make ſome uſe of it by and by:) that <hi>Baronius</hi> finds fault with nothing, neither proceedings, nor proofs; nay commends all, but that he would not have it a right <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> by no means, as I ſaid before; and that he is ſomewhat angry at thoſe words of <hi>Theodorus</hi> in a place,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baron. a. d.</hi> 808. §. 219.</note> 
               <hi>De papa autem quid ad nos, hoc agat an illud?</hi> But much more angry he would have been, had not the ſame <hi>Theodorus</hi> afterwards in his great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, and deplorable condition, with great humility, applyed himſelf to the Pope for ſuccour.</p>
            <p>This was the Caſe: upon which I have this conſideration: If the Pope and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by their own undeniable records, are convicted to have maintained among the Clergy, who ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of holineſs unto others, the practice of lewdneſs and fornication, ſuch as no heatheniſh Common-wealth can parallel, and ſuch as muſt in all probabillity tend to the confuſion of Chriſtianiſm, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and countenancing of Atheiſm and Heatheniſme, more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by far then any thing that can be done or deviſed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary for the advancing of the one, and ſuppreſſing of the other: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in that caſe all men or Churches, truly zealous of Gods glory, and of his truth, were not bound in conſcience to ſeparate from the ſaid Church, (and the head of it,) <hi>as the mother of Harlots and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Apoc.</hi> xvii.11.</p>
            <p>About the year of the Lord 1058. or 59. The cry of theſe fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and abominations of the Church, which had filled all the world, was ſo loud in the ears of Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> the II. (who certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended well, but took a very contrary courſe:) that he imployed one <hi>Petrus Damianus,</hi> a man wholly devoted to the Pope, and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but otherwiſe not unfit for ſuch an imployment, to inquire

and to apply ſome remedy. The account that <hi>Damianus</hi> returned unto the Pope was, that he found the evil gone ſo far, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, that he could do no good. <hi>Tentavi</hi> (ſaith he:) <hi>genitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſacerdotum (Biſhops,</hi> he doth call them ſo at the beginning:) <hi>fibu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las continentiae adhibere, ſed quia haec ſecta eſt</hi> (continentia ſcil.) <hi>cui ab omnibus contradicitur, &amp;c.</hi> As for all other commands and injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that come from your Majeſty (for ſo he writes) we may hope to give you a good account: But in this particular, all that we could extort, was but a bare promiſe made, (or uttered) with trembling lips. <hi>Si malum hoc eſſet occultum</hi> (ſaith he to the Pope:) <hi>fuerat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſſe utcunque ferendum: ſed heu ſcelus! omni pudore poſtpoſito, peſtis haec in tantam prorupit audaciam, ut per ora populi, volitent loca ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantium, nomina concubinarum, Socerum quoque vocabula, &amp; ſocruum; fratrum denique &amp; quorum libet propinquorum.

Now what was the reaſon? Two are there given by the ſaid Author; One is, becauſe they diſpaired that they could attain to <hi>faſtigium Caſtitatis</hi>: not <hi>perfection of Chaſtity</hi> (they were far enough from it:) but to live <hi>chaſtly</hi>; which they reckoned to be a <hi>faſtigium,</hi> or great <hi>perfection,</hi> not to be expected; Another is, becauſe they feared no puniſhment. Will you know the reaſon of that ſecurity? <hi>Damianus</hi> will informe you: Becauſe, ſaith he, (<hi>Noſtris quidem temporibus gemina quaedam Eccleſiae Romanae conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo ſervatur, ut de caeteris quidem, &amp;c.</hi>) In thoſe times, it was the uſe or cuſtome of the Roman Church, in other parts or heads of diſcipline to require performance: but in thoſe things that concern the incontinency of the Clergy, for fear of the inſultation of the Laicks and Seculars, <hi>diſpenſativè conticeſcere</hi>: he doth not ſay, abſolutely <hi>to diſpence</hi>; but (what is the difference?) <hi>by way of diſpenſation to take no notice at all.</hi> And how much leſs is this, then that they might do it by law? And can we think that where the Rulers gave ſuch examples, greater licentiouſneſs among the vulgar can be imagined, in a Commonwealth of miſcreants?

But it will be ſaid, The Pope was ſenſible of it, and did endeavour to remedy it. But how to remedy it except he had taken the right courſe,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.4.</note> which was (commended by the Apoſtle, <hi>Better to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then then to burn:</hi> and, <hi>Marriage is honourable in all</hi>:) to ſuffer Clergy men to marry, as in former times. Which he was ſo far from, that at the very ſame time, whereas the Clergy of the Church of <hi>Milan,</hi> were allowed wives (ever ſince <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his time, certainly and before:) he never left until by his agents he had brought an alteration; though all he could do, could not bring it to any perfection or ſettlement in his time.</p>
            <p>Now, if it were no better, in and before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, as there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion enough to ſuſpect, becauſe beſides the complaint of many of thoſe times, and of that ſide too: (not to ſpeak of <hi>Petrus Aloiſius, Paul</hi> the third, Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> his baſtard; what things, not to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, were laid to his charge; nor of <hi>Joannes Caſa,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Benovento</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which things cannot be ſpoken without horror, though both continued, as is affirmed by good authors, in great favour; nor yet to ſpeak of the ſtate of Monaſteries in <hi>England</hi> in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>^'<hi rend="sup">s</hi> time; if we may believe publick Records:) the cauſe ſtill continued, as it doth yet: I think it will be granted, there was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſt cauſe, had there been no other, for ſeparation from ſuch a Church, where ſuch things to the great ſcandal and detriment of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, are tolerated; and the remedy lawful marriage, (which to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>is doctrine of Devils</hi>;) ſo ſeverely interdicted. But be it ſo, that there is great amendment, (as I make no queſtion, ſome Popes ſince that time, have indeavoured it very really:) if it were ſo then with <hi>Rome</hi>; and that ſeparation from it, upon that account, was lawful; I have what I aim at, that in ſome caſes, beſides errors in doctrine, it may be lawful to ſeparate even from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without any peril of ſchiſm.

ſaid <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> It ſo fell out, that after ſome ſeven or eight years this Emperour, by the barbarous cruelty and treacherous rebellion of his own mother <hi>Irene,</hi> was craftily ſurpriſed, his eyes put out, and he ſoon after made away. <hi>Scelus plane execrandum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Baronius</hi>; ſo he begins:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baron. a. d.</hi> 796.8.</note> he thought it neceſſary to make ſome ſhew of diſlike, or <hi>execration</hi> ſince, that the heavens themſelves did ſo abhor the act, that immediately upon it, there enſued a long darkneſs (of many dayes continuance) in the land, that men could not ſee their way, and all men inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eted it, that it was Heavens reſentment. But notwithſtanding this judgment both of God and men; <hi>Baronius</hi> immediately after theſe words, <hi>Scelus plana execrandum,</hi> with a <hi>niſi,</hi> &amp;c. turnes it into an act of great piety, and worthy of all commendation: warranted by <hi>Moſes</hi> and by Chriſt: for which in very deed, he deſerves the deteſtation of all true Chriſtians: <hi>Niſi,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>(quod multi excuſant) juſtitiae zelus ad id faciendum excitaſſet:</hi> that is, <hi>An execrable act, had not (as many do excuſe it) a zeal of juſtice moved her, to do what ſhe did.</hi> And then again, <hi>Plurimum intereſt, quo quis animo agat, &amp;c.</hi> So that let an act be never ſo horrid in it ſelf, never ſo contrary to the revealed will of God, and rules of his holy word: yet if may be ſaid it was done <hi>ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo juſtitiae,</hi> and out of a good mind (and certainly it is that that moſt aſſaſſinats of princes eſpecially pretend unto:) by this rule it will become not only warrantable but laudable, and a worthy act.

For whereas he ſaith here without any author, that <hi>Irene</hi> did not give any order for the putting out of her ſons eyes, or death; but onely that he ſhould be made faſt or ſecured: his own author whom he doth produce (who alſo was preſent, as he profeſſeth) ſaith directly, <hi>Et circa horam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, crudeliter &amp; inſatiabiliter, oculos ejus evellunt, ita ut mors ſubſequens confeſtim extingueret, conſilio matris ſuae, &amp; conſiliariorum ejus.</hi> Then followeth that memorable change of the skies, which no ſtory can parallel:<note place="margin">

               <hi>orbatus eſt oculis à propria matre idem Conſtantinus.</hi> So far was <hi>Baronius</hi> tranſported with his blind zeal, that he knew not what he ſaid. But now for a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of <hi>Baronius</hi> his perfidious falſe dealing in this buſineſs, and to the end the Reader may the better know him, I ſhall oppoſe to this diſciple of <hi>Nereus,</hi> and a Cardinal, one of <hi>Loyolas</hi> diſciples, a very Jeſuit, even <hi>Petavius,</hi> whoſe account is very different, the more he to be commended for his love of truth and ingenuity. For firſt he tells us that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was forced by his mother much againſt his will to marry that wife which afterwards he put away, whereas ſhe had made him ſure to another before; then concerning that abominable act, <hi>Effoſſis oculis Conſtantinus paulo poſt expiraſſe dicitur.

               <hi>Sed quam inviſum Deo fuerit, Septendecim dierum horrenda caligo teſtata eſt, quae mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem illius conſequnta eſt</hi>: That is: <hi>His eyes being put out, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine is ſaid to have dyed ſoon after. This parricide ſome Graeculi would draw to the praiſe of Irene. But how hateful it was unto God, ſeventeen days horrible darkneſs which inſued upon it, did witneſs.</hi> So <hi>Petavius. Graeculi quidam</hi>: a notable and true cenſure: wherein <hi>Baronius,</hi> though not a <hi>Graeculus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf perſonally, is equally involved: For the matter is: thoſe <hi>Graeculi</hi> would perſwade the world, that this had happened unto <hi>Conſtantine</hi> juſtly at the hands of God; and that his mother did the act of a pious and religious woman in it, becauſe her ſon had cruelly intreated ſome Uncles of his and other kindred, which, ſome in power, had attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet in the throne, in his ſtead: put out the eyes of ſome, and cut off the tongues of others: which indeed was cruel, and abominable; but done, partly by the Counſel of his mother <hi>Irene,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> his own Authors teſtify: which <hi>Irene</hi> had executed little leſs her ſelf, upon others, who as loyal ſubjects did, or were ready to do their parts, to free her ſon from that bondage and ſubjection, againſt all law and equity; in favour of her ſelf and her dear favourite (<hi>Stauratius</hi> by name) even after perfect maturity, She kept him in. Her ſon therefore what he had done cruelly, he did it partly by her advice, and partly by her example: but her unnatural diſloyalty to him, even before this laſt act, (in favour of her ſelf and her favourite, as I ſaid before;) was without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61006:11"/>
What then ſhould make <hi>Baronius</hi> and thoſe <hi>Graeculi</hi> to ſpeak of her with ſuch reſpect? The true reaſon is, becauſe ſhe had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and was after this horrid parricid, a fierce promoter (or <hi>promotrix</hi>) of Image worſhip. Such friends that goodly cauſe hath had: and for being ſuch a friend to the cauſe (a <hi>Myſtery</hi> or <hi>Maxime</hi> our late Rebells and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicides learned of Popiſh zealots) <hi>Baronius</hi> is not willing to believe ſhe could be ſo wicked or cruel, though ſhe ſo cruelly killed her own natural Son; and which is more, her lawful King and Soveraign.</p>
            <p>Now to go on as we propoſe to our ſelves: That one Church may ſeparate from another for errors in doctrine, is not at all doubted: and upon this account it is, chiefly, that we juſtifie our ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The particulars are many, wherein we charge them to have ſwerved from the true doctrine, both of the ſcriptures and primitive fathers. There hath been ſo much written by men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent learning, ſince our firſt breach within the ſpace of 150 years, to make this charge good, as that it is very hard now for any man, be he never ſo diligent, to add ſomewhat to what hath already been done; or indeed to hope, after ſo much done and performed with no better ſucceſs, that any more writing can be to much purpoſe. They that are both wiſe and godly, may hope to do more by praying, then they can do (the confidence of men to maintain a bad cauſe, which doth diſcover it ſelf every day, more and more conſidered:) by arguing or writing. But in very deed it can be to little purpoſe to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout particular points with men who are poſſeſt or rather infatuated with a conceit of their Churches <hi>infallibility</hi>; which of all points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt abſurd and ridiculous, and moſt repugnant to antiquity, what hopes can any man have, that they that can ſwallow this, or have the confidence to preſs it upon others, as a main fundamentall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Religion without which nothing can be certain, or ſatisfactory, either to eaſon or to conſcience, as long as they continue in that mind, will regard any thing that can be alledged in any other point?</p>

                  <hi>p.</hi> 171.</note> 
               <hi>We have already proved the Roman Church (in the ſenſe we underſtand Roman) infallible; and therefore ſhe ought not to be accus'd, for teaching errors. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can ſhe ſubmit her ſelf to any Third, to be judged in this point; both becauſe there is no ſuch competent Third, to be found; as alſo becauſe it were in effect to give away her own right, yea, indeed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her ſelf, by ſuffering her authority to be queſtioned in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all certainty of Faith depends: for ſuch is the Catholick Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</hi> And not long after; <hi>The Church</hi> (Roman Scil.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>So he there, and elſewhere often, to the ſame purpoſe: So that in effect, all controverſies are reduced unto this one of the Popes <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> Which to make the more plauſible, being a point of it ſelf ſo contrary to reaſon, and (upon examination of evidences) to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt experience, that a rational man had need to ſhut his eyes very cloſe, before he can entertain it with any ſtability of aſſent: it is propoſed in many termes, and repreſented under ſeveral aſpects: ſomtimes under the notion of <hi>infallibility of tradition</hi>: ſometimes of <hi>Councils,</hi> ſometimes of the <hi>Church</hi>: all which in their dialect, come to one, as the author of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> doth tell us:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyrinth. p.</hi> 177.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore ſince the infallibility of the Church, Councils and Tradition depend ſo neceſſarily upon one another; whatever authorities prove the infallibility of any one, do in effect, and by good conſequence, prove the ſame of all the reſt.</hi> Now we alſo aſcribe much to <hi>tradition,</hi> in a right ſenſe: more to General Councils: but moſt of all to the Catholick Church, which we acknowledge infallible, in the main fundamentals of Chriſtianity, according to Chriſts promiſe,<note place="margin">

This would give us ſome hopes of ſome poſſible agreement in time. But upon a nearer view, or ſearch into the bottome of the buſineſs, all this is reſolved into the Popes Infallibility;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 33.</note> whatever elſe is pretended, vaniſhes into meer nothing, as will be ſhewed more at large in due place.</p>
            <p>My purpoſe therefore is, inſtead of other particular points, which I ſaid before are many, wherein we charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to have erred groſly and dangerouſly, to inſiſt upon this of <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>; which, though I know it hath been canvaſed and refuted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and by none more ſolidly and rationably, then by the late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop and Martyr, in that Book which the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> makes a ſhew to anſwer: yet becauſe ſome things did offer themſelves to me upon this ſubject, which I have not met with elſewhere; I thought it would not be amiſs to impart that alſo, ſince no diligence can be too great to diſcry a falſhood, where ſo much endeavour is uſed to cry it up to the credit of a Fundamental Truth.</p>
            <p>To uphold this Infallibility againſt all aſſailants, three forts have been raiſed: the one founded upon pretended <hi>Scripture</hi>; the other founded upon the authority of <hi>ancient Fathers</hi>; the third, upon the ſtrength of natural <hi>Reaſon.</hi> What is fetched from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> is ſo remote, that by their own confeſſion, (you ſhall hear them afterwards) little can be made of it: as little from what the teſtimonies of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity afford: but from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> there they triumph, and dare tell Chriſt, had not he ſo provided and ordered, as they would impoſe upon our belief, he had been (I have ſome horror to ſpeak it) neither good, nor wiſe: laying a neceſſity upon us (as much as in them lieth,) either to yield to their inferences, whether we ſee reaſon or no; or to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him in our thoughts, whom our faith doth oblige us to adore as a Saviour. We will therefore begin with that, becauſe they preſume ſo much up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n it; and the rather too, becauſe it hath been leaſt taken notice of by others, (ſo far as is come to our knowledg;) nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that kind of arguing, which may extend much further, if good and warrantable, by any that I know, fully conſidered of. Let
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61006:12"/>
us hear then, if we can hear with patience, what theſe men, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to zeal and conſcience, have made no ſcruple to utter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence it follows,</hi> (ſo one of them) <hi>that even our bleſſed Saviour, who is Wiſdom it ſelf, would have been eſteemed by all the world, not a wiſe Law-giver, but a meer Ignoramus, and Impoſtor. For had he not fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (think you) a ſtrange and chimerical Commonwealth, were it alone deſtitute of a full and abſolute power, (which all other well ordered Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques enjoy) to give an authentical and unqueſtionable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, which is the genuine and true Law?</hi>

                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 77.</note> So the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> whoſe plea for <hi>Infallibility</hi> generally is, becauſe it is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as he doth apprehend it. <hi>Deus non deficit in neceſſariis— This is neceſſary for the peace and unity of the Church: and therefore not to be denied, unleſs an impoſsibility can be ſhewed therein,</hi> p. 263.

For what man is he, that hath any true ſence of humanity, that would not rejoyce in peace, and unity, and concord among men, (and by conſequent in the true means of it;) as the chiefeſt of worldly goods, and the greateſt of heavens bleſsings? But if all that is plauſible to humane reaſon, and which right humanity may oblige a man to wiſh, muſt therefore be true, and paſs among men for good and ſound doctrine: what more plauſible, (to inſtance in one particular;) then that all ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and others, who before Chriſt, lived in the belief and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Deity, and in their lives and converſations (ſo far as their knowledg extended, and humane frailty afforded,) became examples of vertue, of juſtice, temperance, continency, contempt of the world, and the like, unto others; that ſuch ſhould not be excluded from the benefit of Chriſts Redemption?

            <p>Firſt then for Heatheniſme, or Paganiſme: this was the very way, whereby, chiefly, ancient Heathens, the moſt learned among them, did oppoſe Chriſtianity in the myſteries of our Faith.

               <hi>Paul</hi> to that purpoſe) <hi>I will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtanding of the prudent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This very thing, humane reaſon and ratiocination; (ſo conceived and apprehended by men that are ſelf-conceited, and think highly of their own wiſdom: for certainly right reaſon and wiſdom is in all ſuch things, ſo far above the reach of man, wholly to reſt upon divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, as ancient Fathers ſo often inculcate; and I have proved elſewhere, even from the teſtimony of wiſeſt Heathens:) but this very thing, made the Author of the Book, entitled <hi>De vero, veriſimili, &amp; falſo,</hi> upon the ſtrength of his own brain, to which he did very much aſcribe, to deviſe a way of ſalvation common to all men, and to all times: a way plauſible enough, had it any other ground but phanſie. The deſign was to ſhew, that there is no need of a Chriſt: (though he durſt not openly profeſs it;) and what opinion he had of the Goſpel, is not unknown to them that knew him.

            </p>
            <p>The ſame humane reaſon and ratiocination, hath cauſed the reviving of that fooliſh, heatheniſh conceit of the ſouls <hi>praeexiſtence</hi>; which with, or notwithſtanding all its plauſibility, even then ſet out, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61006:14"/>
contrived, to the utmoſt of humane wit and invention, (which the late revivers would make us believe is the light and happineſs of theſe late days:) was by the care of the then rulers and governors of the Church exploded, and caſt out, with ſhame and ignominy.</p>
            <p>Again, humane reaſon and ratiocination (ſo conceited as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) is the thing, that made ſome of theſe late times (pious other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as I have heard;) to fall upon a project of making all men wiſe, and religious, and of one mind; concerning which, (that we may not be thought to inſtance in things not worthy the mention:) ſome Books have been written, and many have been perſwaded to entertain the project, and contributions of money made towards it; though, I dare ſay, ſince that fabulous attempt of ſcaling the Heavens, by heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of mountains one upon another; (I have ſaid it elſewhere, and ſay it again:) never any thing entred into the heart of man, more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous: that I ſay not (though it may be ſaid as truly) more dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to the revealed wiſdom of God. So much for Heatheniſm, and Hereſies, or ſtrange opinions.</p>
            <p>I ſaid this way tended to Atheiſme: For if reaſon muſt be the judg; what advantage will an Atheiſt make of the proſperity of the wicked, in this world (ſo notorious, ſo generally obſerved, that even the godly have been troubled at it) againſt God and a Providence; eſpecially where and when no certain knowledg of the rewards in another world, is yet, or was by revelation?

vain ways, idolatry, and the like, by perſwaſion to the true God, and right manner of worſhip. But being that way did not take, that he ſent <hi>Mahomet</hi> to bring that to paſs by force of armes, which gentler means, reaſon and perſwaſion could not effect.

            <p>Laſtly, Is it likely, in point of reaſon, or agreeable to Providence, that God ſhould make a Pope <hi>miraculouſly infallible</hi> in his publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions and decrees, <hi>ex cathedra,</hi> as they ſay; leſt the Church ſhould receive hurt, and yet ſuffer him to be an <hi>Heretick</hi> in his ordinary life, and profeſsion, from which as much, or more hurt may juſtly be feared? But it will not be granted by all Roman Catholicks, (though by many it is, men of great credit among them, who never were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Hereticks for it) that any Popes have been Hereticks: <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> doth not grant it, nor <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I know; but he that ſhall with judgment and unpartiality, read their anſwers to the objections and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to the contrary, will find, I am confident, that they are put to ſuch ſhifts to find evaſions, that he will rather be confirmed by their anſwers that it is ſo as we ſay, then receive ſatisfaction that it is not. Let any man, to inſtance in one, ſee how <hi>Baronius</hi> is put to it, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit <hi>Honorius</hi> the Firſt, who was excommunicated, after his death, by the ſixth general Council, for a <hi>Monothelite,</hi> and the excommunication confirmed by <hi>Leo</hi> the Second; how miſerably he doth come off; and after many windings and turnings, is glad to betake himſelf to <hi>caligo temporum,</hi> (or, <hi>darkneſs of thoſe times</hi>) for an excuſe; I think he will ſay <hi>Baronius</hi> might have ſpared his pains; but that what ſhift ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he makes, he muſt hold to his concluſion, which was the chiefeſt deſign of all that great and voluminous work. We ſhall have another inſtance in <hi>Liberius</hi> before it be long, where <hi>Baronius</hi> is as much put to it. Now if it be ſaid that the Pope cannot be an Heretick, becauſe when he becomes an Heretick, he doth (<hi>ipſo facto,</hi> ſo ſome) ceaſe to be a Pope; if they mean by that, that at that very time, by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Providence, ſuch a Pope is always depoſed, or doth die: they ſay ſomewhat indeed, but that which is contrary to truth; neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is that their meaning. But to ſay, that he ceaſes to be a Pope <hi>de Jure,</hi> though he continue ſtill Pope, and in full authority <hi>de facto</hi>; the anſwer is altogether impertinent as to Providence: For if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his place without apparent oppoſition; how ſhall people judg him to be no Pope, for his falſe doctrine; and not rather believe his doctrine (upon their principles) good and true, becauſe he is in the Popes Chair? As well may they maintain that the Pope is <hi>impeccable,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61006:17"/>
upon pretence, that as often as he doth ſin, (ſcandalouſly at leaſt) he ceaſes to be Pope, although he return to his right afterwards. And the like may be ſaid of any Prieſt in general, that he is <hi>impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable</hi> upon that account, which ſheweth the impertinency of this evaſion.</p>
            <p>I will inſtance in one particular more, though I think I have already gone over all the particulars I promiſed. Not to ſpeak of the Eaſt Indies, of diſcoveries and opportunities in thoſe parts; when the New World (which may truly be called a New World, either for the extent of Land, found to be greater and greater every day; or for the number of Inhabitants;) was by Gods miraculous providence found out; a way opened for the converſion of innumerable multitudes of heathen people, to the ſaving knowledg of Chriſt, and of his Goſpel: what readier way, in the judgment of humane reaſon, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of ſo great a work, then ſigns and miracles; even as at the firſt plantation of Chriſtianity in the world, the reaſon in appearance being the ſame, and the number of men to be converted not leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable? This made one of the learnedeſt and moſt ingenious Papiſts, who by long experience was throughly acquainted with that buſineſs, to take it into ſerious conſideration, as doth appear by what he writeth of it in his Books <hi>De procuranda Indorum ſalute: lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. where he doth propoſe a queſtion in theſe words; <hi>Cur miracula in converſione gentium non fiant nunc, ut olim, à Chriſti praedicatoribus?</hi> He there tells us, that they were many that wondred at it, as well as he; for that it was (by approved experience) the readieſt way; and that they were <hi>innumerable nations</hi> (whoſe ſalvation they were bound to believe was dear unto God,) that would ſpeedily have been converted, if God had vouchſafed them the ſame means. He doth not abſolutely deny (truſting upon the relation of others) but that ſome miracles, or miraculous operations have been performed by ſome, in ſome places: <hi>verum cur tanta ſignorum parcitas ſit, cum videtur tam effuſa eſſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitas: (neceſsity</hi> the great argument for <hi>infallibility:) meritó: cruciat animum.</hi> It pierced his very ſoul, as he profeſſeth: It is well he was not of the temper of the defenders of Infallibility; God ſhould have heard of it in another manner, as you have heard before. But <hi>Acoſta</hi> it ſeems, had <hi>better learned Chriſt</hi>; and therefore, beſides what Gods holy Word did afford him, which he makes excellent uſe of, having
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61006:18"/>
conſulted with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> upon the matter, whoſe words he doth there produce, he doth reſolve the queſtion with much wiſdom and piety. The beſt reſolution is, (though indeed, he doth alſo, after that, very modeſtly attempt upon ſome other plauſible reaſons:) <hi>Quis novit ſenſum Domini, aut cum quo iniit conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 40.13.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath directed the ſpirit of the Lord; or being his Counſeller, hath taught him?</hi> Which alſo in that great queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the converſion of Nations, why God ſhould leave ſome in their ignorance ſo long, and not afford them the means which he doth unto others, is St. <hi>Auguſtins,</hi> and all wiſe mens that have conſidered of it, their reſolution.</p>
            <p>Hitherto it hath been our buſineſs to ſhew the danger and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency withall of that kind of arguing (in general) which is uſed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and wherein they put great confidence, to prove a neceſſity of the Popes <hi>Infallibility.</hi> But now what may be ſaid for Providence, in this very particular, to ſhew the <hi>unreaſonableneſs</hi> of their allegations, (or blaſpemies rather) as well as <hi>impiety</hi>; the reader, if he pleaſe, ſhall find at the end or concluſion (where I thought it more proper) of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if they ſhall quit that plea, and fly to <hi>Scripture,</hi> or true Primitive Antiquity to prove it, we cannot except againſt the way; and though we have no purpoſe to examine all places and allegations, which would require a large volume, and hath been done fully by more then one; yet I ſhall propoſe ſome things to be conſidered of, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance may ſave ſome men whoſe leiſure doth not ſerve them for long diſcourſes, the labour to ſee further; And though <hi>Infallibility</hi> be the thing that we propoſe to our ſelves chiefly to inſiſt upon, yet becauſe it doth often <hi>coincidere</hi> with <hi>Supremacy,</hi> in proofs and allegations, and hath ſome connexion with it in the Popes caſe, both, as is pretended, being grounded upon one thing, the welfare and unity of the Church; we ſhall not decline what offers it ſelf in the way, concerning that alſo.</p>
            <p>¶ The firſt queſtion then will be, whether it doth appear by Scripture, that ſuch Supremacy joyned with Infallibility, was promiſed to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>? The ſecond, whether to his Succeſſors? As for the firſt, what was granted to St. <hi>Peter</hi> perſonally, as an Apoſtle, will not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to inquire: Of his Succeſſors is all the queſtion. What is ſaid of the firſt therefore, ſhall onely be as it makes way for the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61006:18"/>
of the ſecond queſtion. Thoſe places that are produced to ſhew the Churches Infallibility, we meddle not with them; if any thing can be made of them, they concern not the Pope, but the Catholick Church; the Infallibility whereof, in Fundamentals, we maintain more truly then the Romaniſts do, as we ſhall ſee afterwards.</p>
            <p>But before we enter into the examination of particular places, I ſhall propoſe to the Readers conſideration, what I think he will not think unreaſonable: If it be ſo, as we are told by the abettors of it, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Infallibility</hi> no man can tell what to believe; that there can be no certainty of Faith; and by conſequent, no hope, no poſſibility of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to any: that therefore Chriſt, who in his <hi>goodneſs</hi> had founded a Church, was bound in his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> though by a continued miracle, to provide this infallibility for it, as that without which, his Church could not ſubſiſt; it will certainly follow, that the ſame God did alſo provide that this <hi>infallibility</hi> might <hi>infallibly</hi> come to the knowledg of men, that would not be willingly and obſtinately blind and ignorant. Of all men, I mean, who by their birth, as born of Chriſtian Parents; or, by their converſion afterwards, have, or ſhould have any intereſt in the Church. If they ſend us to the Scriptures, to find it there, we deſire no better aſſurance. But then, ſince it is well known and grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides, that the Scriptures are oftentimes obſcure, and of doubtful interpretation; as once St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> deſired of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> ſo muſt we of our Adverſaries, that they may not produce Scriptures which may admit of different interpretations: but clear, perſpicuous, unqueſtionable Scripture; ſuch as may be ſufficient to convince any reaſonable man that is but capable of common ſence,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Auguſt. De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nit. Eccl.</hi>
               </note> and is not wilfully croſs and refractory. Such Scripture St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> required of the Donatiſts, and ſuch did he produce againſt them himſelf very plentifully.</p>
            <p>The places alledged for the Popes <hi>Infallibility</hi> (into which all <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi> by their doctrine doth reſolve) are three. Firſt, <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>Simon, Simon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> behold Satan hath deſired,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted,</hi> &amp;c. What man, without a revelation, ſince Chriſt knew that <hi>Peter</hi> particularly, which no other Apoſtle did, would deny him, could imagine, that Chriſt intended any more by theſe words unto <hi>Peter,</hi> then this? Though I know, <hi>Peter,</hi> that thou wilt deny me through fear; yet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61006:19"/>
And truly this denial of <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe zeal had been ſo eminent above the reſt of the diſciples, after ſo glorious a confeſſion, might have troubled all the diſciples, had not Chriſt foretold it: by which fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling alſo, the Diſciples in this time of Chriſts apparent outwardly dereliction, were ſeaſonably confirmed, that Chriſt knew all things; and that nothing happened to him, or his, without a providence. But that any infallibility was promiſed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> peculiarly to him, or more then to the reſt of the Diſciples; and not to him onely, but to all his Succeſſors in that See; by which <hi>infallibility</hi> the Church ſhould continue ſound in the faith, and <hi>orthodox</hi>: muſt not he have the ſpirit of Propheſie, that could fetch all this <hi>infallibly</hi> out of theſe words? Beſides, divers ancient fathers have commented upon theſe words. I am not ſo well furniſhed at this time perchance, that I can have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto all. But neither in <hi>Maldonat,</hi> who uſeth to be very exact upon ſuch occaſions; nor in the Rhemiſh Annotations, do I find any Commentators alledged, that have any thing of infallibility. No nor in <hi>Bellarmin</hi>: who doth indeed (as the others alſo, ſome:) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the words of divers ancients, which apply upon occaſion, thoſe words to the Popes, as <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſors. But who are they? Some of them meer counterfeits, as <hi>Leo,</hi> the Firſt: <hi>Felix,</hi> the Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And then others but thoſe later Popes, in their own quarrel, no competent judges or witneſſes. <hi>Bernard</hi> his authority after the Popes were come to that highth, is not conſiderable. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith little, neither doth he quote thoſe words particularly, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth acknow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of thoſe words, <hi>and when thou art converted ſtrengthen thy Brethren,</hi> he bringeth two interpretations; the firſt in reference to the preſent; the ſecond extending to future times, and after-ages.

But the reader may obſerve by the way, how manifeſtly <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth contradict himſelf in this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61006:20"/>
matter. For whereas he ſaith in one place, <hi>Caeterum iſti Patres, (Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Chryſoſtom, Theophylact, Proſper</hi>; by him named before;) <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Though theſe Fathers make no mention of the other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg, which is,</hi> or <hi>was,</hi> (as he a little before doth expound it;) <hi>That as Biſhop, or Pope, he ſhould never teach any thing contrary to true faith —which priviledg did certainly deſcend to his poſteri</hi> (or <hi>ſucceſſors:) yet they deny it not, nor indeed could they, except they would contradict many other fathers.</hi> So here he confeſſeth, that thoſe Fathers, <hi>Theophylact</hi> for one, made no mention of this ſecond priviledg in their expoſitions upon this place, <hi>Luk.</hi> xxii. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the very next place he hath theſe words; <hi>Praeter hos Patres, non deſunt etiam alii authores, qui eodem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, (de ſecundo Privil.) exponunt. Theophylactus in caput</hi> 22. <hi>Lucae, apertè docet, dari Petro hoc privilegium, quia ipſe futurus erat princeps &amp; caput aliorum, &amp; perinde dari omnibus aliis qui illi in principatu ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derent.</hi> And then produceth <hi>Theophylact</hi> his words, (which we had before) <hi>Quia te habeo principem diſcipulorum, confirma caeteros. Hoc enim decet te, qui poſt me Eccleſiae Petra es, &amp; fundamentum.</hi> The ſame <hi>Theophylact</hi> in the ſame place, ſilent, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, a little before, and yet ſo expreſs concerning it, as he makes him here; is not this a manifeſt contradiction? If it be ſaid, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by theſe laſt words, intended onely that ſo much might be collected, or inferred from thoſe words of <hi>Theophylact</hi> he citeth afterwards. I anſwer, were it ſo; yet <hi>non meminiſſe,</hi> and <hi>aperte docere,</hi> is a contradiction however, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied. As for the inference, that that alſo is a falſe inference, doth appear by <hi>Theophylacts</hi> own words immediately following, when he doth expound what follows in the Text, <hi>And when thou art convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. Some may wonder at this kind of dealing; but not they that are verſed in <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and have examined his quotations; they will not wonder at it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond place of Scripture upon which they ground this <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> is that ſaying of Chriſt to <hi>Peter</hi> (concerning which ſo much hath been written on both ſides:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> xvi.18.</note>) <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church: and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> I muſt deſire the reader to bear in mind that we are upon an Article of Faith, (as our adverſaries would have us believe;) which is the <hi>Cardo Religionis</hi>; the main fundamental of Faith, upon which all depends, and without which, no certainty of any thing to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61006:20"/>
be had; no hopes of ſalvation left to any: which therefore (upon their own grounds of reaſon, upon which they build the neceſſity of <hi>Infallibility</hi>) had need to be written in capital letters in the Scripture, that all men may read it there, plainly and legibly; or elſe the Wiſdom and Providence of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reſt may be ſupplied from their own words; I make ſome conſcience, even to repeat them. Now this is the chief paſſage of Scripture, upon which both <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> are built. That much hath been aſcribed to St. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, by ſome ancients from thoſe words, we may, and will eaſily grant: what may be made of this grant, we ſhall conſider afterwards, in its proper place. All that we have to do here, is to conſider, whether there be ſuch a conſent of ancient fathers in the interpretation of theſe words, as may induce us to believe that we have in them plain and direct Scripture, for either abſolute <hi>Supremacy</hi> or <hi>Infallibility,</hi> it hath been the task of more then one, to examine all particular places: I think, if we can ſhew that ſome fathers of principal authority, have pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſence of the words, very different from that which the Romaniſts contend for, and which gives no advantage at all to either <hi>Supremacy</hi> or <hi>Infallibility,</hi> we ſhall have done as much to the full, as in purſuance of what we have undertaken, can reaſonably be expected. The main difference is thoſe words, <hi>Et ſuper hanc Petram,</hi> and upon this <hi>rock:</hi> whether Chriſt intended <hi>Peter</hi> his perſon by that <hi>rock</hi>; or himſelf; or as ſome, St. <hi>Peters Faith</hi>; or the <hi>Church.</hi> I know much endeavour is uſed by the chiefeſt abettors of the Popes cauſe, <hi>Maldonat, Baronius, Perron,</hi> to reconcile their interpretation that would have St. <hi>Peters Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Church,</hi> underſtood with theirs that underſtand St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf. But he that well weighs the places, let him be a friend to the cauſe as much as he will, let him but judg impartially, will commend their will more then their ſucceſs; however we may ſpare that labour. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his <hi>Retractations,</hi> which he wrote when his judgment was ripeſt, and his mind moſt diſengaged, he doth there acknowledg, and in a manner <hi>retract,</hi> that in one place he had followed that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which made St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf to be the <hi>rock</hi>; which, that he might not be thought to have done ſingularly, he doth alledg St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> his <hi>hymn,</hi> where that ſence is followed. But then, <hi>Sed ſcio me poſtea ſaepiſsime ſic expoſuiſſe, &amp;c. Though I did ſo there,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yet I am ſure I did in very many places, ſince that time,</hi> (upon better conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61006:21"/>
belike:) <hi>ſo expound it—ut (ſuper hanc) intelligeretur Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, quem confeſſus eſt Petrus, dicens, Tu es Chriſtus, filius Dei vivi: ac ſi Petrus ab hac Petra appellatus perſonam Eccleſiae figuraret, quae ſuper hanc Petram aedificaretur, &amp; accepit claves regni coelorum.</hi> It is true, he leaves it free to the Reader to follow either; he doth not condemn that former interpretation, expreſſed by St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in thoſe known verſes of his; but if we follow his judgment, it is clear, Chriſt himſelf, not St. <hi>Peter,</hi> is the <hi>rock.</hi> And what need we more? What can <hi>Baronius</hi> anſwer for himſelf, or any body for him, who layeth no leſs then <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to their charge (<hi>eo amentiae provecti ſunt</hi>) who would not have <hi>Peter</hi> underſtood, and by conſequent, nothing here intended to him by Chriſt, particularly? <hi>Baronius</hi> would make us believe, that which gave ground to this interpretation of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is, his ignorance of the Hebrew, or Syriac. True it is, that the difference obſerved by St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> between <hi>Petrus</hi> and <hi>Petra,</hi> will not hold in the Syriac, as to any difference of termination; but as to the difference of ſence, it is the ſame thing in the Syriac, and in the Latine. For <hi>Cephas</hi> for a proper name, and <hi>Cephas</hi> for a <hi>rock, (Tu es Cephas, &amp; ſuper hanc Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pham;)</hi> are quite different in the ſence: Beſides, thoſe that peruſe thoſe many places of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> where he doth aſſert that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Petra,</hi> for Chriſt himſelf, will find that he hath other reaſons for it, beſides that obſervation of the difference of the words; and there be other ancients beſides St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who follow the ſame ſence, and make no ſuch obſervation. And beſides ancients, I will name one of theſe later times, a man of great authority in <hi>Spain,</hi> whileſt he lived, <hi>Michael Medina,</hi> who in his Apology for <hi>Ferus</hi> (hereafter to be mentioned) doth treat of theſe words, and hath more interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then one, but not any that doth concern St. <hi>Peter</hi> particularly; much leſs the Pope, and his pretended Infallibility. We ſhall have occaſion again to ſpeak of the words, and give the Reader fuller ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: But by what we have ſaid, the Reader may judg whether it be probable, that theſe words were ever intended by the Holy Ghoſt, as an <hi>evidence</hi> for Infallibility.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt place of Scripture, is, <hi>Paſce oves meas.</hi> Joh. xxi.16. <hi>Feed my ſheep.</hi> But they themſelves that alledg this, can make nothing of it, but by remote conſequences; (and indeed, if there be any thing of Infallibility in theſe words, who doth not ſee, that every
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61006:21"/>
Shepherd muſt be <hi>Infallible</hi>?) which therefore we ſhall not need to inſiſt upon. But if any man deſire to be further ſatisfied, let him but read St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his 49 Homily upon St. <hi>John</hi>; where, treating of thoſe words, he makes the effect of them equally to concern all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Paſtors; that is, to be tender of their Flock, and not to enter into that charge otherwiſe, then by the right door, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that they were ſpoken to <hi>Peter</hi> particularly: Firſt, becauſe Chriſt (<hi>in Petro for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabat Eccleſiam:</hi>) in the perſon of <hi>Peter,</hi> did lay the platform of his Church; and ſecondly, becauſe <hi>Peter,</hi> having offended more then any other, would be obliged more then any other to the obſervation of this charge: but of any dominion, or peculiar priviledg granted unto <hi>Peter</hi> by thoſe words, not any word there, nor in the next Homily, where he treats of them again; where alſo he doth aſſert Chriſt the onely <hi>Maſter,</hi> and <hi>head Shepherd</hi>: all others without any diſtinction, to have equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now if this be all that the Scripture doth afford for <hi>Infallibility</hi> (for the example of a <hi>chief Prieſt,</hi> among the Jews alledged by <hi>Baronius</hi>; or the <hi>Urim and Thummim,</hi> which he did wear, by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> cannot be called <hi>arguments,</hi> much leſs <hi>evidences</hi>) let the reader judg, whether it have any ground in Scripture to be believed as an article of faith, by all men, as neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But now on the other ſide, it will not be amiſs to conſider, whether a man not pre-occupied or pre-poſſeſt with prejudice, reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es will not be rather inclined, by what he finds there, to believe the contrary. I ſaid before, that Supremacy and <hi>Infallibility</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had ſome connexion. For in very deed, Supremacy, ſuch abſolute Supremacy as the Pope challengeth, without Infallibility (in fundamentals at leaſt) will be very dangerous, and inconſiſtent with the welfare of the Church: and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as was ſaid before, without <hi>Supremacy,</hi> even ſuch as is contended for, to little purpoſe. We ſhall therefore take them here together into conſideration: I will but point at the places briefly, and leave them to the Readers further conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we are often told that Chriſt is the <hi>head</hi> of the Church; ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly called and ſtyled in divers places. As we read, ſo we believe and maintain; and we ſee and admire the effects of this headſhip of Chriſt, in Gods wonderful providences and diſpenſations for the preſervation of a Catholick Church, in all ages, hitherto, notwithſtanding all the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61006:22"/>
attempts of men, or devils, in all ages very viſible, to the contrary. It will not ſerve to ſay, the Pope is <hi>head</hi> under Chriſt; For in a large ſence the ſame may be ſaid of any Biſhop in his Dioceſs, or Paſtor in his Pariſh: and of temporal rulers alſo, more eminently. But the Pope challenging to himſelf ſuch power over the univerſal Church under that title; even as great, as would be due to Chriſt himſelf, if he ruled perſonally: is it not more then probable, that that title being given to Chriſt often, never to <hi>Peter,</hi> or any other; no other can pretend to it, and to the right of it, without manifeſt uſurpation and Sacriledge? St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf charges all Miniſters, <hi>paſcere gregem (paſce oves meas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v.2 4.</note> was Chriſt his charge to him; how much ſhort is this of that, in ordinary conſtruction?) <hi>to feed his flock</hi>: tells them of a <hi>chief Shepherd</hi> to whom they are accountable: ſaith nothing of himſelf: Lord, what other gueſs of language do we find in the Popes Epiſtles, and Decretals?</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul Epheſ.</hi> iv.11. doth ſet down the Hierarchy of the Church (we may ſo call it) in his days: he doth particulariſe the ſeveral char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and offices appointed and inſtituted by God in his Church: <hi>ſome Apoſtles,</hi> ſaith he: <hi>ſome Prophets: ſome Evangeliſts: ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, &amp;c.</hi> He doth it alſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii.28. In both Chapters he doth treat of the unity of the Church, and wherein it conſiſteth: the unity of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church: and the unity of the Catholick Church: Would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man admire, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew any thing of the Popes <hi>Supremacy,</hi> in order to his <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and the Churches <hi>infallibility</hi> (for that is the principal end:) as St. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor; that he ſhould make no mention, either of St. <hi>Peter</hi> particularly: nor of any ſuch charge, to be continued in the Church, ſo neceſſary as we are told to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it?</p>
            <p>And again, the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking of the diviſions among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> relates their words, and makes them ſay, <hi>I am of Paul; and I of Apollo; and I of Cephas; and I of Chriſt</hi>; and then adds, <hi>Is Chriſt divided? was Paul crucified for you?</hi> Which implies the ſame of the reſt alſo: as if he had ſaid: <hi>Was Apollo? Was Cephas?</hi> Would any man think St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have made ſo bold with <hi>Cephas,</hi> as to mention him among the reſt, without any diſtinction, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his ſuperiority, nay ſupremacy; which is now ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61006:22"/>
preſſed and contended for, as if all religion lay in that one Article?</p>
            <p>But above all, let a man calmly and ſoberly, (I mean without paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or prejudice;) read St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2. the whole chapter: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives an account of himſelf, and of his carriage in his charge; in reference (and partly oppoſition) to ſome others, who alſo were Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt: how he ſpeaks of them; firſt in general, <hi>who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſomewhat,</hi> in the ſixth verſe; aſſerting there the Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his charge and proceedings, in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is a very ſignificant word, and of great extent, <hi>In conference added nothing to me</hi>: ſo expreſſed in the Engliſh there; but others more generally, <hi>nihil addiderunt; auctoritatis, aut cognitionis, ſcil.</hi> that is, <hi>they added nothing to me, either of knowledge or authority.</hi> then v.9. naming them whom he intended: <hi>James; Cephas</hi>; and <hi>John; who ſeemed pillars.</hi> And then v. 11. of his conteſt with <hi>Peter,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly; that he <hi>withſtood him to the face</hi> (and v. 14. <hi>before all the company:) becauſe he was to be blamed.</hi> and v. 13. <hi>that he diſſembled.</hi> v. 14. <hi>that he</hi> (with the reſt) <hi>walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Goſpel:</hi> Would not a man think that St. <hi>Paul</hi> foreſaw ſomewhat, or that he was moved by the ſpirit of God, to write thoſe things of purpoſe, to prevent, or at leaſt, to convince the ſtrange attempts and <hi>extravagances</hi> (to uſe the title of one part of the Popes Law, or <hi>Decrees</hi>; which might well be ſo ſtiled) of after-ages? I cannot blame the Pope, if he would not have theſe things read publickly to the people, in a language they can underſtand.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Acts</hi> xv. Where we have the ſtory of the Apoſtles meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, to conſider of ſome doubtfull points; we find indeed that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake firſt; (which <hi>Baronius</hi> and ſome others would draw to an argument of his ſupremacy and preſidentſhip in this Councel; quite contrary to St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> his opinion, who directly makes St, <hi>James</hi> his ſpeaking laſt, or after <hi>Peter,</hi> an Argument of his authority, as Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who alſo doth obſerve, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake more roughly; St. <hi>James</hi> not onely more fully (to end the buſineſs) but alſo more mildly; <hi>as became him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to whom <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt upon the weight of this obſervation, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of it, in this place. All I obſerve upon it is, that if St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> had believed St. <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy, a great part whereof muſt be to preſide in all Councils, he had never written ſo: But we are not yet come to that; (the opinion of the Fathers in general) but that this offered it ſelf in the way. But to return to the Text: Doth not St. <hi>James</hi> ſeem to ſpeak more diſtinctly, not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of ſome things, which <hi>Peter</hi> had not mentioned; (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which determination, the letter was framed:) but alſo in thoſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, (is there not ſome <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in the <hi>pronoune</hi>; which though the Engliſh cannot be without; in the Greek, it is ordinary) <hi>My ſentence is</hi>? <gap reason="foreign">

Thoſe things are direct and pat againſt St. <hi>Peters</hi> Supremacy: ſuch at leaſt, as is contended for: which is the onely ground on which by way of Scripture authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty his ſucceſſors build.</p>
            <p>But when our adverſaries have done all that they can, to bring toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome places that may ſeem to aſcribe to <hi>Peter</hi> ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reſt of the Apoſtles; yet ſtill a ſecond queſtion, they are to prove, wherein they confeſs the Scripture is ſilent: that, what was granted to <hi>Peter</hi> peculiarly, in this kind; was with equal right and infallibility, to deſcend to his ſucceſſors, without which they do nothing. That nothing in the Scripture is to be found, that doth evidently concern the Popes as <hi>St. Peters</hi> ſucceſſor; is the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61006:23"/>I know it is not for men, peremptorily to judge of the heart; yet if we conſider all things, and may judge at any time, by outward appearances, their judgment we may ſay, is not without great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, who think (as divers have profeſſed) that none are further from the belief of this ſtrange <hi>Paradox</hi> of <hi>infallibility,</hi> then they that are moſt earneſt, and apparently zealous, to make others believe it. The reaſon may be; becauſe many, upon the authority of great names, and ſome plauſible allegations; and eſpecially by the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the aſſertors; may probably be induced to believe it, truly and really: but that they that have taken the pains (as they muſt that defend it:) to look neatly into it, to ſee what can be ſaid for it or againſt it; ſhould not diſcerne the falſehood of it, the manifold contradictions and abſurdities; is indeed very hard to believe.</p>
            <p>And becauſe they ſend us to the Old Teſtament, ſometimes; and would make ſome advantage of ſome things there; I ſhall onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Reader to conſider: What difference ſoever we find of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations and diſpenſations; of ordinances and commands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the times before and ſince Chriſt; without further inquiring into the reaſons, we think our ſelves bound with all humility to ſubmit to the wiſdom of God, and verily to believe, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God did appoint in Church or State, for the government, or well being of it preſent and future, was abſolutely beſt, ſo as God had appointed. In thoſe things, where Gods will and authority reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us in his word, hath not interpoſed; there we leave ſome liberty to human ratiocination. Whereas the Church (viſible) was formerly confined by Gods own order and decree (what reaſon of man can penetrate into the cauſes?) to one particular Nation; we believe ſince Chriſt, a <hi>Catholick</hi> Church: that is, Congregations of Chriſtians in all places of the world, united in and by the main fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Chriſtianity: and by their head CHRIST JESUS: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which Catholick Church (becauſe it is ſo revealed unto us and promiſed by Chriſt himſelf:) we verily believe the <hi>Gates of hell ſhall not prevail.</hi> But of any particular Church; that it ſhall be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> it ſelf, and the means of <hi>infallibility</hi> unto others, having no ground from ſcripture, we ſee nothing in the courſe of Gods Providence in former times, that ſhould induce us to believe. For certainly, God was then the ſame God, under the law in himſelf,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61006:24"/>
and in his own nature, (if we may ſo ſpeak) as he hath been ſince the Goſpel. He had a Church then, which Church had an intereſt in Chriſt, as it hath had ſince Chriſt. The people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were his choſen peculiar people, whom he did cheriſh, and protect miraculouſly, from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me to time, more then he did ever any other Nation. What care he took alſo for their inſtruction, that they might continue in his Fear, and true Worſhip, is abundantly recorded in the Scripture. Yet for all this, and thoſe miraculous operations, ſo frequent among them, God did not provide for their <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Both they, and their Prieſts, did frequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntly apoſtatize in matters of Faith; and embrace falſe Doctrines: and they had ſchiſms, and diviſions among themſelves: and yet ſtill, God had a Church; a company of faithfull people, which though not without errours perchance, more or leſs, ſtuck ſtill to the main foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
            <p>So much of the Scripture; which I think I may conclude, doth not oblige us, neither Old nor New, to believe this <hi>Infallibility</hi> which our Adverſaries lay upon us, as the grand fundamental point of Faith. And to ſay, That Chriſt was bound in his honour to order it ſo, as they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke bold; doth imply certainly, (we have already ſaid it, and here repeat it purpoſely, becauſe much depends of it) that he did alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide, how all men (pretending to Chriſtianity) might come to the knowledge, and be aſſured of it; without which notification, or declaration, publick and obvious unto all men, learned and unlearned, it would do but little good. How then a Fundamental, if not in the Scripture?</p>
            <p>But if all primitive Chriſtians did agree upon it, in the opinion and practice, it would be ſome argument, I confeſs, that it was at firſt grounded, if not upon direct Scripture, yet upon Apoſtolical Tradition, or Inſtitution. In the next place therefore, we ſhall ſee, what can be alledged for it from the conſent of Antiquity. For ſtill we muſt ſtand upon that, that being ſuch an Article of Faith, as without it all other belief is bootleſs, or inſufficient to ſalvation: the evidences of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and general practice, had need to be very clear, and irrefragable, elſe the matter will be leſt very doubtfull, and not to be received, or preſſed, as an Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, I ask: Might it not (upon grounds of reaſon and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility) have been expected, that an Article of that conſequence (as is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61006:24"/>
pretended) wherein every ſouls future happineſs, and the preſent wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, yea, very being of the Catholick Church, is ſo much concerned; ſhould have been thought of, if not in the firſt (which we call <hi>the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed</hi>; as the moſt ancient, ſo the moſt compendious of all the Creeds) yet in ſome one of the reſt, that have been made and received ſince, upon emergent occaſions: ſome of them profeſſing to contain the whole (not <hi>preciſely</hi> ſo, we grant; but the moſt Fundamental) Catholick Faith? Well: nothing of it in the <hi>Creeds.</hi> What in the <hi>Councels</hi>? thoſe that are generally received, as moſt ancient, and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical: the firſt four General Councils? Have they any thing of it? Somewhat, I know, may be alledged out of the Acts of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; for it, and againſt it. As much againſt it, I dare undertake, upon accurate examination, and more, then for it: But that requires long time; I hope there will be no need. Beſides, we may take that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Baronius</hi> doth, to queſtion the integrity of ſuch Acts of Councils, where they do not make for him. And indeed, it doth require good judgment and great diligence, to know what is ſincere, and what is not, in the generality of thoſe Acts; that cannot be denied. But <hi>Baroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> for the moſt part, goes by one Rule: as things make for the Pope, or againſt, ſo he doth own, or reject.</p>
            <p>For example: in <hi>Honorius</hi> his caſe (whom we ſpake of before) the Acts, he ſaith, of the Sixth General Councel are not to be truſted. In <hi>Liberius</hi> his caſe, whom St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and ſo many others do witneſs, to have ſided with the <hi>Arians,</hi> and to have ſubſcribed to their Confeſſions; ſo many evaſions, with great Art, and ſubtilty of wit, have been devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as may perchance prevail with ſome to a belief, that he was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, as to matter of Hereſie: but with more, I doubt, that ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the objections and evidences, with the anſwers and evaſions, that there is no ſuch thing, as <hi>truth,</hi> really: and that men trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in vain, in their inquiries after it. But yet at laſt, ſo God would have it, that certain <hi>Fragments</hi> of Hiſtory, concerning what paſſed at the Councel of <hi>Ariminum</hi> where the <hi>Arians</hi> did eſtabliſh their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; written by that renowned ancient Father, <hi>Hilarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> in <hi>France</hi>; with other records of antiquity of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; were found and ſet out in <hi>France,</hi> out of the Library of <hi>Pet. Piſhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> one of the famouſeſt Philologiſts of that Countrey; but ſet out by <hi>Nicolaus Faber,</hi> who, beſides other learning in general, and exemplary

Piety, for which he was made choiſe of, and truſted with <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. King of <hi>France</hi> his education, and learning; had the name and reputation generally, to be beſt ſeen in Ecleſiaſtical Hiſtories and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, of any in that Countrey (to go no further) without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Baronius</hi> was beholding to him, and doth acknowledge it, in more then one place. <hi>Faber</hi> did ſet them out with a large and learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. Now by thoſe <hi>Fragments,</hi> &amp;c. it doth clearly appear, that <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> did ſubſcribe to (and thereby authorized, ſo far as his Papal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority could go) that peſtilent <hi>Regula,</hi> or <hi>Formula Fidei,</hi> (ſo called) ſet out by the <hi>Arians</hi> at S. <hi>Sirmium,</hi> ſo much deteſted and anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by the Orthodox party: for which act, <hi>Anathema's</hi> are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt him by that Godly Biſhop <hi>(Hilarius.) Anathema tibi à me dictum Liberi, &amp; ſociis tuis. Iterum, tibi anathema, &amp; tertiò, praevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator Liberi.</hi> And <hi>Faber</hi> takes notice of it, in his Preface, in theſe words; <hi>Hoc unum addere ſufficiat, ex verbis Hilarii,</hi>&amp;c. Beſides that, the ſame <hi>Liberius,</hi> as ſoon as he was Pope, charged <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and condemned him, as by his own Letter, there ſet out, doth appear: which Letter, though <hi>Faber</hi> makes no queſtion at all of the truth and <hi>genuineſs</hi> of it; (<hi>falſam, aut ſubdititiam eſſe, ſtylus negat; &amp; praete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea, cui bono?</hi>) yet he doth acknowledge, that ſome objections may be made againſt it: and therefore we will not build upon it. But for the reſt, as <hi>Faber</hi> is very confident, ſo may any body elſe be, even upon the judgment of that learned man, if himſelf be not ſo able to judge. But what ſaith <hi>Baronius</hi> to this? There was no way to avoid,<note place="margin">

Yet in this particular, he had a hard task, when he muſt oppoſe the judgment of ſuch a one, as <hi>Faber</hi> was. But what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, ſince it was ſo reſolved in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; though ſo many <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> being forced by the light of ſo many evidences, have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the contrary; that a Pope can not be an Heretick?</p>
            <p>Let the Reader judge by this, how far Proteſtants, in reaſon, may think themſelves bound to ſubmit to thoſe Acts (of Councels, I mean) when objected to them by <hi>Romaniſts</hi>; which <hi>Romaniſts</hi> can ſo freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, when they make againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:61006:25"/>But to leave them: The Canons of thoſe Councels is that which we may ſafely truſt to; and the onely thing indeed, (with their <hi>Creeds</hi>) which can be be called their doctrine or determination. What is there in any of theſe Councels, concerning this main article of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Even nothing; nothing at all for it: but ſomewhat againſt it there is in the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> where the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> his <hi>pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency</hi> is derived, not from Scriptures, but meer Cuſtom; confirmed alſo ſince that by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperor.</p>
            <p>Now for the particular Fathers, and other Writers of thoſe times, if we do not much rely upon the teſtimonies that are produced out of them in this particular; not as undervaluing their authority, but as having juſt cauſe to ſuſpect the <hi>genuineſs</hi> of all thoſe teſtimonies that are obtruded in their names, I think no body can juſtly blame us. For firſt, who knows not how many things, even anciently, have been forged in the behalf of that cauſe? All the <hi>Decretals</hi> of the firſt Popes (moſt of whom were Martyrs, and ſhould therefore be of greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;) are of that nature: all deſtinated to that end, to inſinuate a <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Infallibility</hi>; but all, though received into the body of the Canon Law for good, and to be of equal authority with Scripture it ſelf, forged, adulterous, ſuppoſititious ware; and this, after much conteſt, acknowledged by <hi>Baronius,</hi> by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> by all men that are not very ignorant, or much blinded with partiality. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the matter of many of them, ridiculous, or falſe; and the falſe <hi>dates,</hi> and the like: the language is ſuch of moſt of them, as he that can believe it is the language of thoſe primitive Popes, may as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Engliſh which is now ſpoken, and was ſpoken three or four hundred years ago, is all one, and not to be diſtinguiſhed the one from the other. We may ſee therefore of what judgment, or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (ſhall I ſay) the author of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> is; who,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 208. <hi>&amp;</hi> 334.</note> notwithſtanding ſo many of his own ſide, who have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the impoſture, doth alledg them, as unqueſtionable; and elſewhere doth take upon him to defend them, but comes off very ſadly, and needs no other confutation then their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, <hi>Baronius</hi> eſpecially,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baron. v Blond. p</hi> 114. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 112.</note> whom I think the Reader will believe the abler of the two, to judg of ſuch things. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> though he had done what he could, to uphold their credit, (though even there, <hi>indubitatas eſſe, affirmare non audeo,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61006:26"/>
is his confeſſion;) yet afterwards, he gave it over, having left moſt of them quite out in his Catalogue, <hi>De Scriptoribus Eccleſiaſticis</hi>: and if he mention any (as he doth thoſe that are aſcribed to <hi>Clemens</hi>;) he doth give reaſons why they ſhould be rejected rather then approved. If any deſire further ſatisfaction about them, let them read learned <hi>Blon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dellus</hi> his <hi>Pſeudo-Iſidorus.</hi> He will admire: I will ſay no more.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide; whether it may not as juſtly be ſuſpected, that many pregnant evidences of that truth, which we aſſert, have been ſuppreſſed, and pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>poſely deſtroyed, let the reader judg by this one particular. Two Epiſtles there be above the reſt; the one of St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians,</hi> the other of a contemporary Biſhop, of great fame, in thoſe days, who joyned with <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the cauſe; both, in St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> works, which do not pleaſe the Zelots of the Roman Cauſe. The reaſon is manifeſt: For I dare ſay it, and maintain it; were there no other writings extant of antiquity to help us; thoſe two Epiſtles (if the authors of them were not <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks, eo nomine,</hi> for that very conſideration, for oppoſing Pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> as they did, which they never were accounted, but holy men; <hi>Cyprian</hi> eſpecially, not inferior to any, the moſt renouned Fathers:) are very ſufficient to juſtifie us, and to confound the aſſertors of either <hi>Supremacy</hi> or <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi> They charge him there (Pope <hi>Steven</hi>) of <hi>pride, impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, contradictions, breach of Eccleſiaſtical unity, boldneſs, perverſneſs, folly, hard obſtinacy, preſumption, contumacy</hi>; this is the language throughout the firſt Epiſtle: and in the ſecond, beſides repetition of the ſame, or great part of it; they compare him to <hi>Judas,</hi> (in ſome things) upbraid him with ſiding with Hereticks: <hi>quinimo tu haereticis omnibus pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor es:</hi> make him worſe then the worſt Hereticks; animoſity and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for want of wit; ſchiſme and apoſtacy: (the words are, <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum verò quam magnum tibi exaggeraſti, quando te à tot gregibus ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſti! Excidiſti enim te ipſum; noli te fallere. Siquidem ille eſt verè ſchiſmaticus, qui ſe à communione Eccleſiaſticae unitatis apoſtatam fecerit. Dum enim putas omnes à te abſtinere poſſe; ſolum te ab omnibus abſtinuiſti</hi>:) Again, That he did <hi>contra ſacramentum, &amp; fidem, contumacis furore diſcordiae rebellare</hi>: and in concluſion, whereas <hi>Stephen</hi> had ſtyled <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> (for this kind of language, it ſeems, begun from him) <hi>a falſe Chriſt, falſe Apoſtle, and deceitful workman: Firmilianus</hi> ſaith, it was done falſely, (<hi>per mendacium:</hi>) and that he <hi>(ex merito,) deſervedly,</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:61006:26"/>
might be ſo called. I know well enough, St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did not like theſe things ſhould be revived, but forgotten, for the honor of both <hi>Steven</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi>: yet St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth nowhere except (though he do againſt the opinion it ſelf of rebaptization, which was the cauſe of the quarrel;) againſt St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as though he had misbehaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in point of duty, or tranſgreſſed againſt canonical obedience for ſo writing to the Pope, which is the main buſineſs: And I am very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, had St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> been put to it, as we are; charged with ſchiſme and hereſie; yea, impiety, in the higheſt degree, for not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> which the Pope doth challenge unto himſelf as an article of Faith, he would have been the firſt man that would have made uſe of St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> authority, and example; (he had him in ſuch veneration) as we do.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Epiſtles therefore, the latter being the ſharper, and beſides that, affording us ſome notable paſſages, (which we ſhall make good uſe of in due place:) in ſome editions (one at <hi>Rome</hi>) was quite left out, for this very reaſon, becauſe ſo prejudicial to the Pope, as <hi>Pamelius</hi> doth gueſs; who alſo doth as good as profeſs (<hi>conſultius foret nunquam fuiſſe hanc epiſtolam editam, &amp;c.</hi>) that he would have ſuppreſſed it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had it been in his power. The Reader may conſider what op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity the friends and Patrons of the Roman cauſe had, to forge, and to ſuppreſs what they would themſelves, when the world through the ſuperſtition and ignorance of thoſe times (before Printing) was ready to receive any thing; and all Manuſcripts almoſt, in the hands, and by the hands of Monks and Fryers, who wholly depended on the Pope.</p>
            <p>But now for Antiquity, and conſent of Fathers, before we come to particular teſtimonies; I would gladly know, if any ſuch thing were known to Antiquity, (ſtill I muſt add, as fundamental, and neceſſary, which doth much aggravate the caſe:) how comes it to paſs, that neither <hi>Clemens</hi> in his <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> (what antiquity ſoever you allow them, ancient enough for this purpoſe;) who doth ſo largely write of Eccleſiaſtical orders; Biſhops, eſpecially: Nor <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita</hi> (whom our adverſaries make ſuch reckoning of, and will have him to be the right <hi>Dionyſius</hi> mentioned in the New Teſtament, which we believe not; but ancient enough, he alſo, to ſerve our turn in this place:) in three books of his, of the <hi>Church Hierarchy,</hi> eſpecially when
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61006:27"/>
he treats of the unity of the Church in many places; that neither of theſe takes notice of this great myſtery of Religion (though myſterious enough, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> eſpecially:) <hi>Supremacy</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi>? I cannot imagine what the moſt zealous for the cauſe can ſay to this; or can do leſs, at leaſt, then wonder. If it be ſaid, it needed not, becauſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known: if that were granted, yet in ſuch a proper place, to take no notice of ſuch a fundamental point, ſo neceſſary to peace and unity, how can it be leſs then wilful perfidiouſneſs, or ſacrilegious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication? It is true, that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> makes honourable mention, in one place, of <hi>Peter,</hi> as chiefeſt of the Apoſtles: but that is of <hi>Peter</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and meerly by the way; not by way of obſervation of any neceſsity or divine providence in it. Certainly then, they knew it not: no ſuch article of Faith was then heard of.</p>
            <p>Again: <hi>Gennadius Muſsilienſis,</hi> who lived before the ſixth Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, firſt a <hi>Prieſt</hi> onely, (as in the title:) but afterwards, as <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirm, made Biſhop; hath written a Book, <hi>De dogmatibus: Eccleſiae.</hi> He begins with the moſt fundamental points, the ſubject of the <hi>Creeds</hi>; and ſo goes on: and though <hi>dogmata fidei</hi> be his proper aim, and ſubject: yet he doth intermix many things that belong to diſcipline and government alſo: as particularly, he hath one Chapter, what men are incapable of holy orders: where this particularly (I wiſh all men took good notice:) <hi>Neque illum, qui uſuras accepiſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincitur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 72.</note> (ſo I find it in the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Church of <hi>Geneva</hi> too:) <hi>aut in ſcenâ luſiſſe dignoſcitur:</hi> among others is to be found. Yet I will not ſay, he doth comprehend all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely that may be reduced unto that head. However, it is hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if either <hi>Supremacy</hi> or <hi>Infallibility</hi> had been ſuch an article of Faith, ſo neceſſary, (we muſt often repeat it:) ſo fundamental: no mention of it, would have been made. In the 26. Chapter, occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, Pope <hi>Zozimus (beat a recordationis Papae Zozimi regularis au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas:)</hi> is mentioned, and that is all.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt acknowledg, that the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> begun betimes to arrogate unto themſelves: there be Epiſtles of <hi>Innocentius</hi> and <hi>Zozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> that go very far, (and they began the fifth Century:) in point of ſpiritual power and juriſdiction. But of all ſuch, and to all, we have one general anſwer, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: it is their own cauſe that they plead for: no wonder if they be ſo zealous for it. St. <hi>Peters</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61006:27"/>
(ſuch as it was) was ſome ground; and it is the infirmity of many; they think they are bound in conſcience, or at leaſt in point of reputation, to advance the credit of their place, as much as they can. So one, after another; and every predeceſſors example, is an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſucceſſor: Neither let the Reader wonder, if we ſpeak of them, though pious otherwiſe, as men. What <hi>Ammianus Marcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a Heathen Hiſtorian of thoſe times, writeth of the pomp, pride, and luxury of the Biſhops of that See, I will not inſiſt upon; he was a Heathen: But what <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> a holy man, whoſe memory is ſacred, commended by divers ancient fathers, doth write and teſtifie, (he lived about the ſame time when thoſe Popes lived) is obſervable. In one place, he noteth the wicked ambition; in another, the ſtrange covetouſneſs of the then Rulers and Governors (whom he calls <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtros Eccleſiae</hi>:) of the Church: but in general, <hi>temporum noſtrorum piget, taedetque:</hi> which includeth much. Many ſuch complaints of their times, we have in the writings of the Fathers; ſome more ancient; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that lived ſince: not to ſpeak of the very Diſciples of Chriſt, and their contentions, who ſhould be greateſt; for which they were rebuked by Chriſt. What therefore the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> did challenge as their due, is not much to our purpoſe to enquire: but what was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and generally believed by others of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>There is not any Writer, that the Patrons of that cauſe make more boaſt of, then St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>: he indeed, as conſiderable as any, both for antiquity and perſonal merits. The words that are produced with much oſtentation out of him, are, that <hi>Super Petro fundata eſt Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia:</hi> which words, or to that purpoſe, <hi>Cyprian</hi> uſeth in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Words indeed, which of themſelves (eſpecially were it as certain, that they extended to his ſucceſſors:) might ſeem to import very much: whereas, if we look into the meaning, as he himſelf doth explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it will clearly appear, that little or nothing can be made of them. The ground of this expreſſion, doth appear by his Book or Treatiſe <hi>De unitate Eccleſiae</hi>: where endeavouring to prove the Unity of the Church by Scripture, he hath divers arguments; ſome whereof are more direct and concluding; others, more remote; from bare ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, and typical alluſions. One argument is (often preſſed by him and others:) <hi>Unum corpus, &amp; unus Spiritus, una ſpes vocationis, una fides, unum baptiſma, unus Deus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. lv.4, 5, 6.</note> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61006:28"/>
is, from thoſe words, <hi>I and the Father, are one: and thoſe three are one.</hi> Another is, from Chriſt his ſeamleſs coat: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother from thoſe words of <hi>Joſuah</hi> unto <hi>Rahab,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 1 Joh. 5. Joſh. 2.19.</note> 
               <hi>And it ſhall be, that whoſoever ſhall go out of the doors of his houſe, into the ſtreet, his blood ſhall be upon his head; —and whoſoever ſhall be with thee within this houſe, his blood ſhall be upon our head, if any hurt be upon him.</hi> Others there be, which I omit. But the firſt argument, or proof of <hi>unity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. xvi.18</note> are thoſe words of Chriſt to <hi>Peter, I ſay unto thee that thou art Petet, and upon this rock, I will build my Church,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which words he doth deſcant thus: <hi>Super illum unum aedificat Eccleſiam ſuam, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Upon him alone he doth build his Church, and gives him charge to feed his ſheep. And though,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>after his reſurrection, he gave the ſame power to all the Apoſtles;— nevertheleſs to declare this unity, he appointed, unam Cathedram,</hi> (one Chair) <hi>and by his authority eſtabliſhed this original of unity, which ſhould begin from one.</hi> So then, from thoſe words of Chriſt, he fetches a myſtery of unity; in that, though Chriſt gave the ſame power unto the reſt, yet he firſt uttered it, of one. <hi>Super illum unum aedificat Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiam ſuam:</hi> that is, in addreſs of ſpeech, to commend unity to us, in a myſtery: but upon the reſt, as well, in truth, or reality of deed. That he intended it ſo, and ſo barely; his words immediatiatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are very expreſs, when he ſaith: <hi>The reſt of the Apoſtles were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily what Peter was, having obtained</hi> (or, indowed with:) <hi>equal ſhare of honour, and of power: ſed exordium ab unitate proficiſcitur:</hi> that is, <hi>but the beginning of this honor and power, muſt be in, or from unity</hi>: (to wit, when it was at firſt given to one alone; when Chriſt ſpake thoſe words unto <hi>Peter;) Primacy was given unto Peter, that one Church, and one Chair might thereby be teſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This might be illuſtrated, by what others ſay of it, to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had juſt ſuch a conceit (be it underſtood with reſpect) upon thoſe words of Chriſt: <hi>Ego ſum Paſtor bonus; Paſtor ergo bonus Chriſtus.</hi> That is: <hi>I am the good Shepherd; Christ then is the good Shepherd.</hi> It follows: <hi>Quid Petrus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What was</hi> Peter? <hi>was not he alſo a good Shepherd? Did not he alſo lay down his life for the ſheep? What was</hi> Paul? <hi>What the reſt of the Apoſtles? What thoſe Biſhops and bleſſed Martyrs, who ſucceeded after thoſe times? were they not all good Shepherds?</hi> &amp;c. and then after a long <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> concerning falſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61006:28"/>
Martyrs and mercenaries, he returns to his former ſpeech; of <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and the reſt, that they were all good Paſtors. He ſtands upon <hi>Peter,</hi> to prove it of him more particularly, that he was a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and a <hi>good Shepherd.</hi> Both <hi>theſe,</hi> from thoſe words that paſſed between Chriſt and him: <hi>John</hi> xxi.15, 16, 17. and then concludes, <hi>Ergo Paſtor</hi> (Petrus ſcil.) <hi>&amp; bonus Paſtor (nihil quidem ad poteſtatem &amp; bonitatem Paſtoris Paſtorum:) ſed tamen ipſe &amp; paſtor bonus, &amp; caeteri tales paſtores boni.</hi> That is: Why then <hi>Peter</hi> he was a ſhepherd too, and a good ſhepherd (though not to be compared for power nor for goodneſs to the Shepherd of ſhepherds:) yet even he a good ſhepherd too, and all that were like him, they alſo good ſhepherds. Then he addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Chriſt: <hi>Quid eſt ergo, quod paſtoribus bonis commendas unum paſtorem</hi> (he doth mean Chriſt himſelf) &amp;c. that is, What is it that to good Paſtors, thou (Chriſt) doeſt commend one good Paſtor? What, but in that one thou doeſt teach them unity? He hath more to the ſame purpoſe: ſo glad were they of any thing, that had but the ſhew of an argument for <hi>Unity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> therefore, as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> of thoſe we have ſpoken, makes a <hi>myſtery</hi> of the words, not a <hi>grant</hi> of any power or juriſdiction. Can any thing be more plain then theſe words, <hi>Pari conſortio praediti, &amp; honoris &amp; poteſtatis?</hi> And ſo S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> that <hi>Epiſcopus, ſive Romae, ſive, Eugubii, &amp;c. ejuſdem meriti, ejuſdem eſt &amp; Sacerdotii.</hi> Which words (as others before him) the Author of the <hi>Labyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inth,</hi> doth endeavour to elude,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 222.</note> by ſaying that it is ſpoken of <hi>the office and power Epiſcopal, in it ſelf</hi>; which is alike in all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: but not of the Popes power, as he is Pope; an additional, and ſupereminent power, given him, by Chriſt. But how little to the purpoſe this is, may eaſily appear, by the context of St. <hi>Jerome's</hi> words, and by the occaſion: and I deſire the reader to take notice of it, that is not yet fully acquainted with their manner of dealing.</p>
            <p>Two things St. <hi>Jerome</hi> did propoſe to himſelf in that Epiſtle. Firſt, to aſſert the right of Prieſts above Deacons (which gave occaſion to the Epiſtle) by their inſtitution: and ſecondly, to juſtifie the cuſtoms of other Churches and Countreys, againſt that pretended cuſtom of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> After he hath done with the firſt, he falls upon the ſecond. Now, the queſtion was not, of <hi>the power of Biſhops,</hi> by vertue of their ordination or conſecration; which every man muſt in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61006:29"/>
reaſon underſtand, to be the ſame in all, if it be the ſame order or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: but in general, whether any Biſhop by his See, or otherwiſe, had any more power or authority, then another: and particularly, whether the cuſtoms and orders of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before other Churches cuſtoms, (for the Biſhops ſake:) and obliged men to imitation and conformity. <hi>Nec altera Romanae urbis Eccleſia</hi>; (there he begins:) <hi>altera totius orbis exiſtimanda eſt.

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:61006:29"/>
where he doth ſo fully expreſs himſelf for the Pope of <hi>Rome's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as he doth here againſt both. If he doth in ſome places ſpeak honourably of that Biſhop, and aſcribe ſomewhat to him, as St. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor; we ſay (and it is moſt true) both he and others, were many times, put to it by adverſaries (ſchiſmaticks and hereticks) and glad were they to ſtrengthen themſelves and their cauſe, with the authority of that See; which indeed, to do it right, did for a long time continue very orthodox in all things; (that one of <hi>uſurpation,</hi> or <hi>ſupremacy,</hi> tenderly firſt attempted, then by degreees obtained and practiſed; excepted:) and a great ſupport to them that were ſo in all parts of the World. Which was the greateſt occaſion, through other Churches compliance, upon this conſideration, of her greatneſs and ſuper-eminent authority. They that are well verſed in antiquity, and will judg rightly, will obſerve it, and acknowledg it. But why ſhould not we interpret (as others) St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> by St. <hi>Hierome?</hi> thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in him that are more doubtful and obſcure, by thoſe that are more full and expreſs?</p>
            <p>But we return to St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> our chiefeſt aim at this time. I take it to be a very conſiderable matter, as any in the whole controverſie; in what ſenſe St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (and others after him) affirmed, <hi>that the Church was founded upon</hi> St <hi>Peter</hi>: whether by that ſpeech, he did intend any <hi>Supremacy,</hi> or <hi>Infallibility</hi>: yea, or no. For that indeed, as I ſaid before, is a ſpeech that ſeemeth, of all alledged in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to import moſt, though nothing that extends to his Succeſſors. Beſides what hath been ſaid already, I further argue: If <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Collegues in this cauſe, even then, when they withſtood <hi>Stephen,</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> with that liberty, as we have ſeen; condemned his opinion, deſpiſed his authority; (as they begun, ſo they continued, reſolute and conſtant, as long as they lived, in their oppoſition, of which more afterwards:) but, if even then, whileſt they pleaded their cauſe againſt him; they did put him, or others, intereſſed in the ſame buſineſs, in mind of thoſe words of Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> thereby to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his cauſe, or crime, as <hi>violator,</hi> or breaker <hi>of the unity of the Church</hi>: ſurely, it muſt be granted, (deny it who can, and reconcile them to reaſon, and common ſence, in the act:) that they had no thought of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> or <hi>Infallibility</hi> (for elſe, had they not ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, ridiculouſly prevaricated, in their own cauſe?) granted to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61006:30"/>
Pope or Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by thoſe words of Chriſt unto <hi>Peter.</hi> But ſo they did: <hi>Cyprianus,</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Quintus,</hi> concerning rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization: <hi>Nam nec Petrus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>quem primum Dominus elegit, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>For neither Peter, whom the Lord choſe firſt, and upon whom he built his Church: when Paul did contend with him about the circumciſion, did upon that, inſolently vindicate, or arrogantly aſſume any thing unto himſelf, that Primacy did belong unto him; and that he ought to be obeyed by them, that were but newly choſen,</hi> (St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he meaneth;) <hi>and came after.</hi> If any ſhould anſwer, that St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> intention by theſe words, is to commend St. <hi>Peters</hi> humility, not to queſtion his right: grant the words in themſelves, will bear that ſence; how can it be his ſence, whileſt his practice was openly, profeſſedly contrary? That is it that I urge, and aim at, by theſe words.</p>
            <p>But for the ſence of the words, (without this conſideration) let us take another paſſage of the ſaid <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and I think there will be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle queſtion. They are words (thoſe I intend) that were ſpoken by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> at a meeting of the African Biſhops, about this buſineſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization, which had cauſed the breach with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt, ut de hac ipſa re, quid ſinguli ſentiamus, &amp;c.

Whereas, of them that he ſpake unto, he had not the

            <p>Well, we have heard what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did write to <hi>Quintus</hi> his friend. Now let us hear what <hi>Firmillianus,</hi> a man of grear renown for parts and piety, Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> and Metropolitan, highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Baronius,</hi> did write unto him about the ſaid buſineſs. <hi>At<expan>

                  </expan> ego in hac parte, juſtè indignor ad hanc tam apertam, &amp;c. And here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I can do no leſs then profeſs my juſt indignation, for the open and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt folly of Stephen,</hi> (Pope <hi>Stephen,</hi> he would have ſaid:) <hi>that he, who doth ſo boaſt of his See, and doth pretend to</hi> Peters <hi>Succeſsion, upon whom the Church is founded, doth bring in many rocks, and ſet up new ſtructures of many Churches, whileſt he doth avouch by his authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> right baptiſme to be there.</hi> They that ſo freely yielded to the Pope at that very time when they ſtood upon terms of defiance, as it were, with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>; that the Church was founded upon <hi>Peter</hi>; certainly, they did not think they did yield any great matter unto him, when they yielded ſo much. And ſince <hi>Cyprian</hi> had ſo many who joyned with him in that diviſion: and that none of them were accounted ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks or hereticks for it: it muſt needs follow, that no ſuch article of Faith was then known, as either <hi>Supremacy,</hi> or <hi>Infallibility.</hi> The like may be obſerved concerning the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops, who were excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by <hi>Victor,</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>: who for all that, neither living, nor dead, were ever accounted Schiſmaticks, or the worſe Chriſtians; but Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> generally, much condemned (it is a known hiſtory:) for his raſhneſs, and want of charity.</p>
            <p>But here again, I muſt deſire the Reader to take notice of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries way of dealing; let him give it the right name, as he ſhall ſee occaſion. I ſaid a little before, that <hi>Cyprian</hi> continued in his oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to his lives end: and a little before that, that though St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> excepted againſt <hi>Cyprians</hi> opinion of rebaptization, which was the occaſion of the quarrel; yet I did not find any where, that he did except againſt him, that he durſt (though otherwiſe of himſelf, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth obſerve of him, a very meek, humble, and charitable man:) ſo freely reject Pope <hi>Stephens</hi> judgment, with ſuch language, as you have heard: this certainly, is a great argument, that not <hi>Cyprian</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:61006:31"/>
onely, but St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> were ignorant of any duty that other Biſhops did owe unto him, more then to any other. This <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> it ſeems, was very ſenſible of; and therefore to prevent the uſe that might be made of it, ſomewhat he thought muſt be done. In his fourth Book therefore <hi>De Rom. Pontifice,</hi> Ch. 7. he doth propoſe, <hi>An peccaverit Cyprianus mortaliter, non obediendo Pontifici</hi>: that is, <hi>Whether</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian <hi>did ſin mortally, in not obeying the Pope.</hi> A very ſeaſonable que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, certainly: For elſe, what becomes of the Popes Authority, if ſuch as <hi>Cyprian</hi> might withſtand him, and without ſin, deal with him as he did? Now he doth reſolve the queſtion out of two places of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> two ways. Firſt, out of his Book <hi>De Bapt. c. Don. c.</hi> 18, and 19. That <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſinned <hi>venially</hi> onely; and that it was a ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in a fair ſoul; which he did expiate by his martyrdome. But <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> is not ſatisfied with that anſwer; but argues againſt it, that it is more likely, he did ſin mortally: in that he did ſo little regard the Popes <hi>judgment,</hi> (though not <hi>definition</hi>:) and not onely ſo, but oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him ſo <hi>contumeliouſly.</hi> And therefore for a ſecond reſolution, he doth produce another paſſage out of the ſame <hi>Auguſtine (Epiſt.</hi> 48.) where the Father ſaith, ſome doubted whether thoſe Epiſtles, (of that argument) were right <hi>Cyprians</hi>: But ſecondly, that it is poſſible St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> might repent before his death, and be of another opinion, though no record of it be extant. Who would not ſay, that doth look no further then <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that he hath acquitted himſelf very well, and done the Pope great right? But if you look the places by him quoted in St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it is quite another thing. For there, in neither place, doth St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeak of the Pope, or of St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> manner of dealing with him, whether good, or bad, not one word, or ſyllable: but onely of the opinion (<hi>rebaptization</hi>) which St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> maintained, which he ſaith was a <hi>naevus</hi> in him, ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated (by his other excellent parts, <hi>humility, charity,</hi> &amp;c. he had ſaid before:) by his <hi>martyrdome.</hi> So that in very truth, <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> inſtead of anſwering, hath made the objection much ſtronger. For if the <hi>opinion</hi> was a fault in <hi>Cyprian</hi>; (though truly, before the <hi>definition</hi> of a general Councel, no very great <hi>fault,</hi> or <hi>error:</hi> as may appear by what St. <hi>Baſil</hi> writes of it in his <hi>Canons</hi>:) yet an <hi>error,</hi> or <hi>fault,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo pertinacious in the defence of it:) acknowledged by St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> (a great admirer of that Saint:) much more would he have
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61006:31"/>
thought himſelf bound, to take notice of his ſo manifeſt diſobedience to the commands, and contempt of the authority (that grand ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle as we are now told, of our Faith;) of Pope <hi>Stephen</hi>: had he apprehended him guilty of any ſuch thing. And though St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> had ſaid, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was more bitter and right down, in ſome expreſſions, then he needed to have been: that had not helped the Popes cauſe: he might have ſaid ſo perchance, though <hi>Cyprian</hi> had written to his inferior. But even ſo much he doth not: not in thoſe places (neither is there any errors in the citations) to which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth refer us. What kind of dealing this is, I leave to the reader to conſider. It was worth the while, even ſo: but it makes for us too, and that we are now upon, not a little.</p>
            <p>I have done with St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>; but before I leave him, I muſt not omit to let the Reader know (or put him in mind at leaſt) that in thoſe words we have conſidered of, and began with, there is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble variety in the Editions of <hi>Cyprian.</hi> For thoſe words, <hi>ſuper illum unum aedificat Eccleſiam ſuam: &amp; illi paſcendas man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

I have one at preſent printed at <hi>Paris, A. D.</hi> 1512. <hi>ſumptibus Magiſtri Bartholdi Rembolt</hi>; dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Robertus Fortunatus,</hi> to <hi>L. Ruricio Bleſenſi:</hi> in which none of thoſe things are to be found: And they that have ſeen <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his Editions, ſay as much of thoſe: and which is moſt obſervable, <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi> alſo doth ſo exhibite them in the body of the Canon Law. Since therefore this variety doth proceed from ancient <hi>Manuſcripts</hi>; nor cannot be conceived caſual (as often it happens) but intended and wilful: we have great reaſon to believe, that ſome to favour the Pope, did add thoſe words of purpoſe; but that any ſhould leave them out, of purpoſe, ſince thoſe <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> were neither written, by, nor in the hands of Proteſtants, we have no reaſon at all. However, for my part, as to <hi>Cyprians</hi> opinion in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of St. <hi>Peters</hi> primacy; or, of the Church being founded upon him; I confeſs ingenuouſly, I can make no great advantage of this diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61006:32"/>
becauſe, <hi>primatus</hi> is acknowledged by others; and granted by Proteſtants: and, <hi>that the Church is founded upon Peter,</hi> in that ſence we have ſhewed, is St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> aſſertion in other places that are not queſtioned. But this uſe at leaſt, we may make of it, that ſince it doth plainly appear that ſuch tampering and adulterating hath been uſed; we may ſuſpect it hath been done, where it is not ſuſpected; or at leaſt, not diſcoverable by ſuch evidences.</p>
            <p>This book of St. <hi>Cyprian, de unitate</hi>: (that is the right title: for it hath another too in ſome Editions:) which hath given us ſo much occaſion: happily puts me in mind of a book of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> bearing the ſame title,<note place="margin">To. 7. <hi>p.</hi> 621.</note> 
               <hi>de unitate Eccleſiae.</hi> Now that which our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries chiefly ground the neceſſity of <hi>ſupremacy</hi> upon (on which <hi>infallibity</hi> doth depend:) is <hi>unity</hi>: no Catholick Church without unity; no unity without a Pope, ſo inſtated and impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as they maintain. And this is their continual Plea. I ask therefore; if without the Pope, ſo and ſo qualified, abſolute, univerſal &amp;c. there can be no unity; how comes it to paſs; nay, how poſſible, that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſhould write a book of <hi>Unity (Unity</hi> of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Chuch) of purpoſe with much accuracy (as indeed it is) and in all that book not ſo much as mention the Pope, or Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>; no one word of <hi>Univerſality,</hi> or <hi>ſupremacy,</hi> or <hi>infallibility</hi> in all that book?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Uni. V. Card. Perron. p</hi> 50. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> True it is, unity, at large, is a large ſubject. For there is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of communion, internal, and external: unity of doctrine, of diſcipline and government: unity of rites, and ceremonies; and the like: and beſides all theſe (though it comprehendeth all theſe in ſome degree:) there is that, which we may call <hi>Catholick Unity</hi>; proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed to <hi>ſchiſme</hi> and ſeparation. I call Catholick unity, the acknowledgment of a Catholick Church, with actual communion with it, and all the members of it, under one and the ſame head, Chriſt; which doth include unity of Faith, or ſoundneſs of Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, in the main fundamentals, neceſſary to ſalvation, according to St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> his declaration in that book ch. 4. which I wiſh the Reader, if he be at leiſure, to peruſe. This is the unity, of the breach whereof, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were guilty, who did not acknowledge a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, or which in effect doth amount to it, did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no other true Catholick Church, but their own. So that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writing againſt them in that book, his buſineſs was to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61006:32"/>
prove, that there was a Catholick Church, diffuſed throughout the whole world (or the greateſt part) according to the promiſes of God by his Prophets in all ages: which he doth fully and copiouſly, by clear and manifeſt places, and teſtimonies of Scripture. His occaſion therefore I confeſs, did not oblige him to treat of all kind of Unity in that book: No: but if all true <hi>Catholick Unity</hi> depend of ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Pope, and communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as we are told, and that this was the Faith of the ancient Church: Why ſhould not St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> have gone that way rather, to prove them ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which of the two (if it were indeed the Faith of the ancient Church, and that Faith grounded upon clear Scripture:) would have been the moſt compendious and ready way? But is it not ſtrange, and indeed if that had been St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Faith, and the Faith of thoſe times, as we ſaid before, incredible; that in all the book, not any mention is made of Pope, or Roman Church? I might ſay, and that would be ſufficient, of either Pope, as univerſal Biſhop; or Roman Church, as the Catholick Church. But indeed which doth adde to the wonder, of either Pope in general; or Roman Church, in general: as if he had avoided it purpoſely; for ſome cauſe beſt known to himſelf; but probably if for any cauſe, becauſe he ſaw how ready both Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were, even then, to take to themſelves: to uſurp and to arrogate <hi>in leges Eccleſiae</hi> (as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> before:) againſt the rights of the Catholick Church. In the tenth Chapter of that book, St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth very particularly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerate all the Chriſtian Churches, mentioned in the Scripture; he doth begin with the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi>: at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi>; item at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Iconium</hi> and <hi>Liſtra</hi>; the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi, Theſſalonica, Coloſſus, Pontus, Galatia, Capadocia, Aſia, Bithynia; Smyrna, Bergamus, Sardis, Thyatira, Philadelphia, Laodicea:</hi> beſides the Churches of <hi>Achaia</hi>; of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and between <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyricum,</hi> and the like not particularly expreſſed (as he doth obſerve) but included in thoſe general words. Had he added the <hi>Roman</hi> to theſe, it would not have taken away any thing of the weight of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation we chiefly aim at, but that he ſhould not mention it, I think may juſtly be wondred at; though I will not be very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but that my eyes, or memory, (though I have read the book more then once, and ſince that looked over him again of purpoſe:)
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61006:33"/>
or my Edition (which is that in 8<hi rend="sup">vo</hi>. <hi>Lugduni apud Sebaſt. Honorat.</hi> 1562. as moſt commodious for uſe:) do not deceive me. For that St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth quote ſome words out of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Epiſtle, or ſome out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi>; that I hope will not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as an expreſs mention of the Pope or <hi>Roman</hi> Church. In the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, he doth mention <hi>Eccleſias fundatas per Apoſtolorum la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bores</hi>; and again, <hi>Apoſtolice labore fundatas,</hi> in the ſame Chapter: in general: and Chapter 16, he doth make particular mention of <hi>Optatus Milevitanus,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſius Mediolanenſis</hi>: as men whoſe credit and authority was very eminent in the Catholick Church, beſides <hi>innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merabiles noſtrae communionis Epiſcopos,</hi> including doubtleſs in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> among the reſt: but not any ſpecial mention of him. Moreover, it is obſervable, that in this very book, Chap. 18, and 19. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> doth upon occaſion, inſiſt upon thoſe words of Chriſt to <hi>Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church</hi>: and doth expound that <hi>rock,</hi> by that mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 7 24. <hi>I will liken him unto a wiſe man which built his houſe upon a rock</hi>; that <hi>rock</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are they which hear the word of God, and do it.</hi> So little did he think of St <hi>Peters</hi> prerogative, at that time; as granted unto him by thoſe or any other words of Chriſt.</p>

            <p>I have mentioned divers books (beſides this laſt of St. <hi>Auguſtin. De Unitate Eccleſiae</hi>:) which becauſe when there was occaſion, and the ſubject was proper, they make no mention of the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, or infallibility; I conceive it may be inferred from their ſilence, that they knew it not; (it was a thing unknown in their time:) or at leaſt, believed it not, I have one more, and he ſhall be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61006:33"/>
the laſt of my authors, to this effect; of whom I ſhall ſay before hand (becauſe I would have the reader to judge, as well as I:) that if my judgment fail me not extreamly, he alone might have been ſufficient, to have done the deed abundantly.</p>
            <p>The author I intend, is, <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis:</hi> who lived about the beginning, or before the middle of the fift Centurie. To whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth give this teſtimony. <hi>Scripſit opuſculum, parvum mole, ſed virtute maximum; de profanis vocum novitatibus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De ſcript. Eccl. p.</hi> 149.</note> 
               <hi>Libellus extat, &amp; utiliſſimè legitur.</hi> The ſubject of the book is, as himſelf doth propoſe it, and ſet it down at the beginning; how a man <hi>certa quadam, &amp; quaſi generall ac regulari via Catholicae fidei veritatem, ab haereticae pravitatis falſitate, diſcernere:) by a certain, and as it were general, and regular way (or method) may diſcern the truth (or verity) of the Catholique faith, from the falſehood of heretical depravation</hi> (or <hi>adulteration.</hi>) Is not this the great controverſie, between us and the Romaniſts? And which I am now upon? Is not this the chief ſubject of the late Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop (of bleſſed memory) his book; and of the anſwer to it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Labyrinthus Cantuarienſis</hi>? Let us hear then, what this ſo much approved and commended author, not only by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> but by many others, of that ſide beſides, doth deliver; and, what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, not as his own ſence only, but as the ſenſe of the ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and worthieſt of thoſe times, whom he profeſſeth that he ſought unto for their advice, as many as he could have acceſs unto. Nay in his third and laſt ſummary or recapitulation, he doth affirm; <hi>(fuiſſe ſemper, &amp; eſſe hodieque Catholicorum conſuetudinem) that it had ever been, and was then, the Cuſtome of the Catholicks, ſo to do</hi>; or to go the ſame way, which he doth here propoſe, and commend.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then, <hi>Vincentius</hi> layeth down theſe two grounds; <hi>Dovinae legis authoritatem: tum deinde Eccleſiae Catholicae traditionem:</hi> that is, the authority of the Divine Law (or Gods Word) and then, the tradition of the Catholick Church. Not but that the Scripture is of it ſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſufficient: (as he doth acknowledg:) but becauſe men are very apt to vary in the expoſition of it. Well: <hi>Tradition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi>; What is that? That is, ſaith he, the <hi>intelligentia,</hi> or <hi>ſenſus,</hi> (his own words) <hi>the ſence, or expoſition of the Catholick Church.</hi> But what <hi>Catholick Church?</hi> The preſent Church, or Roman Church?
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61006:34"/>
No ſuch matter. <hi>In ipſa Catholica Eccleſia, &amp;c. In this Catholick Church,</hi> ſaith he; we muſt follow, <hi>Univerſality, Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</hi> Firſt, it muſt be the ſence of the whole Catholick Church, all the world over. Secondly, it muſt be the ſence of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church: and Thirdly, there muſt be a conſent of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers. <hi>Vincentius</hi> goes on: What ſhall a Catholick Chriſtian do, if ſome one particular Church do forſake the communion of the general, (or univerſal) Faith? What, but prefer the ſoundneſs of the whole, before the contagion of a part. But what if the contagion attempt the whole? (he ſaith of the hereſie of the Arrians afterwards: <hi>pene totum orbem contaminaverat, &amp;c.</hi>) Then he muſt have recourſe to <hi>Antiquity.</hi> What if Antiquity it ſelf hath been tainted? (It ſeems he did ſuppoſe it poſſible:) not onely two, or three particular men; but a whole Town or Province? Then he muſt ſtick to the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of general Councels: (<hi>Si qua ſunt univerſaliter antiquitùs, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalis Concilii decreta:</hi>) and in his third recapitulation: <hi>Si quid eſſet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitùs ab omnibus Eccleſiae Catholicae Sacerdotibus, univerſalis Concilii auctoritate decretum:</hi> a hard matter this: and therefore he ſpeaks of it doubtfully, <hi>Si quid, &amp; Si qua</hi>: But what if the matter is ſuch, as hath not been defined by any ſuch Councel? Why then, the conſent of ancient Fathers, (<hi>recurrendum ad ſanctorum Patrum ſententias,</hi> in his third recapitulation:) of ſeveral ages, and places, who have always been reputed orthodox; that muſt be our refuge and remedy in ſuch a caſe. And here <hi>Vincentius</hi> his <hi>Rule,</hi> or direction, doth end: which, becauſe he would not be miſtaken, in a buſineſs of ſuch weight; he doth ſet down the ſummary of it three ſeveral times, with ſome variety of words, but not any at all of the matter: In the beginning, about the middle, and at the end of this book: which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> told us before, is of no great bulk; neither indeed is it. His diligence therefore, is the more obſervable. All the reſt of the Book, is but an explication, or expoſition of all the particulars contained in this <hi>Rule.</hi> In all thoſe three <hi>recapitulations,</hi> or <hi>ſummaries,</hi> his laſt reſolution after Scripture, is, the ſence, and conſent of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>Let us hear, I pray, before we proceed, how this doth agree with the doctrine of the late Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury. And for the Rule,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Relat. p</hi> 336.</note> 
               <hi>which governs me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if I cannot be confident for my ſoul upon the Scripture, and the Primitive Church expounding
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61006:34"/>
and declaring it, I will be confident upon no other. I have all the reaſon in the world, to be confident upon this rule, for it can never deceive me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now to <hi>Vincentius</hi> again: I ask in the firſt place, Did <hi>Vincentius,</hi> or thoſe he had conſulted with, know any thing of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Pope, or any particular Church: (or of the greater part of the <hi>preſent Church,</hi> I might add: but we are not upon that now:) was any ſuch thing known or believed generally, or by many, in thoſe days? Certainly, he that will ſay ſo, muſt alſo believe, though <hi>Vincentius</hi> for ſome reaſons, ſpared the name of the Pope, or to ſet down the opinion in expreſs terms; yet his intention was to confute it, by this book; his <hi>Rule</hi> here delivered, being ſo diametrically, repugnant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. If any ſhould reply, that all he had written of this ſubject, is not extant: true it is indeed, that the greateſt part of the ſecond Book (the whole conſiſted of two) is not extant, nor hath been theſe many ages. But what is wanting (as doth cleerly appear by his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) was but a further proſecution, or confirmation of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars by him delivered, by ſome examples; as particularly of the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian general Councel againſt <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> which Councel was held in his time. The particulars of that Councel, was the whole ſubject of the ſecond Book: and he gives us a particular account of thoſe particulars, (what they were, and how proſecuted:) in that which remaineth of it. So that this evaſion is ſufficiently prevented. Thoſe three reiterated <hi>recapitulations,</hi> or <hi>ſummaries</hi> we ſpake of before, the like whereof I do not remember in ſo ſmall a book; may not one ſay, there was a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it?</p>
            <p>Now let us go on with <hi>Vincentius</hi> his <hi>method,</hi> or ſome particulars of it rather, not before ſpoken of; for his <hi>Rule,</hi> I ſaid before, was ended. But theſe definitions, (ſaith he) of general Councels (if ſuch have been, or can be had:) or this conſent of ancient fathers (our laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge) muſt it be expected, or ſought, for every thing that we believe in all doubtful points?</p>
            <p>So the Romaniſts tell us, and it is an article of Faith with them, that whatſoever is propoſed unto us by the preſent Church, or Pope; funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, or not fundamental; muſt be believed with equal certainty of Faith: elſe, that all that we believe (a horrible,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Laby. p.</hi> 15.</note> damnable doctrine) will do us no good. <hi>All points defined by the Church</hi> (the preſent Church) <hi>as matters of Faith,</hi> (ſaith the Author of the <hi>Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth:)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61006:35"/>
are fundamental; that is, neceſſary to ſalvation to be believed by all thoſe to whom they are ſufficiently propounded to be ſo defined.</hi> And again, <hi>It is manifeſt, that all points defined by the Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>are fundamental, by reaſon of that formal object, or infallible authority propounding them, though not always by the matter, which they contain.</hi> And again: <hi>It is manifeſt, that if the Church be disbelieved in any one point, there can be no infallible faith of any thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſaith <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis? Quae tamen antiqua ſancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Patrum conſentio, non in omnibus divinae Legis quaeſtionibus, ſed ſolum certè praecipuè in fidei regula:</hi> (what the ancient Fathers call <hi>fidei regulam</hi>: and even the Council of <hi>Trent, principium illud, in quo omnes qui fidem Chriſti profitentur, neceſsariò conveniunt:</hi> The Reader, I hope need not to be told, that is not a ſtranger to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity:) <hi>magno nobis ſtudio inveſtiganda eſt, &amp; ſequenda.</hi> And again: <hi>Ut ad unam Eccleſiaſtici ſenſus regulam ſcripturae caeleſtis intelligentia dirigatur; in ijs duntaxat praecipuè quaeſtionibus, quibus to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius catholici dogmatis fundamenta nituntur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is plain and expreſs; This conſent muſt be expected in fundamentals onely. And ſo the Reverend Arch-biſhop; That the whole Church cannot univerſally erre in the doctrine of Faith (<hi>fidei regula,</hi> in <hi>Vincentius:) is moſt true, and is granted by moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants: ſo you will but underſtand its not erring in abſolute fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental doctrines.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 139.</note> And elſewhere: <hi>Now therein there can be no neceſſity of an infallible certainty in the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi>

               <hi>and much leſs in a general Councell, of things not abſolutely neceſſary in themſelves. For Chriſt did not intend to leave an infallible certainty in his Church, to ſatisfy either contentious, or curious, or preſumptuous ſpirits.</hi> Let the Reader judge who come neareſt to the faith of the ancients, in this main funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.

            <p>
               <hi>Vincentius</hi> doth ſuppoſe (a ſuppoſition though ſomewhat ſtrange, yet not without all ground, as may appear by what hath been ſaid before of the corruption of ancient books; and others, forged and ſuppoſititious) that an hereſie may ſpread and prevail; and by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, attain to preſcription of age and antiquity: in a word ſo far prevail, that it may have the opportunity, to corrupt and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate ancient books; to ſuppreſs ſome and forge others: What now? Surely now (in ſuch a ſtreight: ſuch a pinch as this:) or never, we ſhall hear of an <hi>infallible</hi> Pope or Church: now, or never; who will not ſay as much? Alas poor man! neither he, nor any of his time, that he adviſed with; nor any before them, were ſo happy; they knew of no ſuch thing. What a ready ſatisfactory anſwer had he had, had he known of it, or any body that he knew? For want of this knowledge (the happineſs, or happy diſcovery of latter ages) he is forced for a Remedy, to ſend us to Scriptures; or to the decrees, (if any be to be had) of general Councels, and there to leave us. But that he doth adviſe, to prevent this ſtreight, not to give errors or hereſies this advantage of time or growth; but as ſoon as they begin to appear, preſently fly to the Scriptures and the conſent of Fathers, in their expoſitions. But the Reader probably may deſire (in a matter of ſuch moment) <hi>Vincentius</hi> his own words, which therefore I have ſet down whole; out of a very good edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I conceive; ſet out in <hi>Paris</hi> (I gueſs <hi>Petrus Pithaeus</hi> might have a hand in it:) in Quarto, <hi>apud Sebuſtianum Pinellum: A.D.</hi>

            <p>I think we may conclude (which is all can be made of it, for ought I know) that he that ſo ſpake of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (as many others did in thoſe days with all civil reſpect:) had no quarrel to him, no intention to do him wrong, to deny him his cue: not his <hi>Supremacy</hi> then, or <hi>infallibility</hi>; had he known or believed any ſuch thing: which doth not a little confirm what we concluded before upon thoſe pregnant evidences, that he knew no ſuch thing belonging unto him.</p>

Eſpecially, if it be conſidered withall, that before any mention of thoſe teſtimonies, (of <hi>Felix,</hi> or <hi>Julius,</hi> or <hi>Syſtus,</hi> or <hi>Celeſtin.</hi>) he doth argue from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 28. <hi>And God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, Secondly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, thirdly teachers,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>This comes very near to St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> cenſure of <hi>Stephanus</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> before ſpoken of. So that for concluſion, I ſhall repeat what I ſaid before, (and I ſpeak it from my heart, according to thar meaſure of judgement wherewith God hath endued me:) that if the Author had intended purpoſely, to write againſt the opinions of theſe times, (ſome beginnings whereof he might have ſeen in his days, and fear the progreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) I do not know (but that he did forbear openly to profeſs it:) how he might have written more pertinently, more pregnantly.</p>

Secondly, from the uncertainty of the perſons. And laſtly, from the different opinion of other Roman Catholicks (generally, ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, notwithſtanding their diſſent:) about it.</p>
            <p>Firſt then we ſay; this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ſo earneſtly contended for, which if certain and evident, would prevent, or ſoon allay all diſtractions, and diſturbances of thoughts; is a thing ſo perplex, and <hi>intricate</hi> in it ſelf; ſo full of confuſion, and uncertainty; that he had need to be a right <hi>Oedipus</hi>; (if he look into the nature of it, and do not take it upon meer truſt:) that can tell what to make of it, to receive any comfort, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from it. Firſt, we obſerve the variety of terms, wherewith, the better to comply with variety of opinions, and to conceal their own differences; yea diviſions; they ſet out this aſſertion, (or article of Faith, as they make it) unto the world. Sometimes it is called the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Church: ſometimes of <hi>Councels,</hi> and ſometimes of <hi>Tradition:</hi> though under that variety, one thing by moſt, be intended; and that is the Popes <hi>Infallibility.</hi> The Infallibility of the <hi>Church Catholick</hi> (with due reſtriction) even Proteſtants do maintain: of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,</hi> many Romaniſts, that cannot endure to hear of the Popes: and <hi>Tradition</hi> is a very ambiguous word, in the writings of ancient Fathers; being taken ſometimes for the doctrine of the Goſpel, and moſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental points of our Chriſtian Faith. Specious words therefore; but that we may ſay of them—<hi>atrum Deſinit in piſcem (Annulus Piſcato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>; I need ſay no more:) <hi>mulier formoſa ſuperne.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> firſt, (the Catholick Church:) <hi>mulier formoſa ſuperne,</hi> we may ſay of it:<note place="margin">

The Author of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth,</hi> doth many times profeſs, that no more is required of any Proteſtant, but that he ſhould believe the Popes infallibility when he hath the aſſiſtance or concurrence of a General Council: whereby he ſeems to grant ſomewhat towards peace, and accommodation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences: but in effect, as he doth explain himſelf, he grants nothing at all. For beſides what he writes in ſome places, where he ſeems more directly to contradict himſelf, as where he hath theſe words: <hi>Hence alſo it follows in proportion</hi> (upon allegation of Chriſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as in the former times:) <hi>that the Biſhop of Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 103.</note> 
               <hi>being Paſtor of the whole Church, and intending to oblige the whole Church by his definition, cannot (in the common opinion) erre for the ſame reaſon:</hi> beſides this, I ſay, which is more direct; the opinion which he with others, maintain <hi>of infallibility, in the concluſion,</hi> though not in the <hi>means</hi> or <hi>premiſſes,</hi> (which neither he, nor any body elſe doth pretend to reconcile to ſence, but are glad to fly to Gods omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency for it: doth altogether void the uſe, or expedience of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Councels,</hi> or indeed of any <hi>counſel</hi> at all: ſo that they may be thought to deal far more ingenuouſly, who plainly write and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that whether the Pope uſe any endeavour or no (to find out the truth) it is not at all material, let him but <hi>define,</hi> he will be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> as ſome of them have openly profeſſed. So that a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of general Councells, is but a meer mockery; but no ſmall argument to us, or to any that will judge indifferently, that they that are put to ſuch ſhifts, are not unſenſible of the badneſs of their cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now if that be the <hi>common opinion,</hi> both of them who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſs it, and of many others who cunningly rather inſinuate, then abſolutely declare, that the Pope in his <hi>definitions</hi> (laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the concurrence of Councels) is <hi>infallible</hi>: it will be ſome work
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61006:39"/>
to find out, what it is, that he doth <hi>define as Paſtor of the whole Church, by his definition</hi>: (as the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it:) and what he doth <hi>define</hi> and avouch as a privat perſon,<note place="margin">p. 242.</note> if the ſubject be matters of Faith. A Pope may be an <hi>heretick</hi>; (it is granted by divers, who nevertheleſs maintain his <hi>infallibility.</hi>) Liberius <hi>in perſecution might yield</hi>: Marcellinus <hi>for fear, might commit adultery</hi>; Honorius <hi>might fall into hereſie, and more then all this,</hi> &amp;c. So the <hi>Rhemiſh Annot.</hi> upon <hi>Luke</hi> 22. v. 31. and yet continue in actual poſſeſſion of his chair. May not he probably, write, and write peremptorily like a Pope, to maintain his errors? And though he do not write, will not his private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and opinion, he being a publick Perſon, and the Oracle of the world by his place, be looked upon by moſt men, who do not underſtand the niceneſs, and punctilios <hi>of Pope as a private Doctor</hi>; and, <hi>Pope as Paſtor of the Church</hi>: or, <hi>Pope in the Chair, and out of the Chair,</hi> as others expreſs it; and <hi>intending to oblige the whole Church</hi>: and the like to be looked upon I ſay as publick <hi>defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what are the <hi>Decrees</hi> of Popes, and <hi>Decretals?</hi> The chiefeſt part of the Canon-Law: are they not to be looked upon as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>definitions?</hi> Yes, certainly: <hi>Conſiſtories, Courts, Councels, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi>: So we are told, and in reaſon it ought to be ſo. Now it will be proved by and by, that thoſe <hi>Decrees,</hi> and <hi>Decretals,</hi> contain abominable falſe doctrine, rejected and condemned for ſuch; by a great part, if not greater part of Roman Catholicks: which the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> and other late Engliſh writers of that ſide, do profeſs to diſclaim and abhor. But firſt of repugnancies and contradictions.</p>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>Decrees,</hi> (we ſay) have many irreconciliable contradictions, where what one Pope had <hi>decreed,</hi> is repealed by another, as falſe and erroneous:<note place="margin">p. 472.</note> So that of neceſſity one of the Popes muſt be acknowledged to have erred. Learned <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. v. 39. (<hi>liberata eſt à lege: cui autem vult, vubat:</hi>) hath many pregnant inſtances, to which not a few more might be added if there were any need of it here. But we have enough beſides, if I be not much miſtaken. I will inſtance in one particular, where thoſe <hi>Decrees</hi> are contrary to the doctrine of theſe

times, maintained and aſſerted by other Popes. The adminiſtration of the <hi>Communion</hi> or holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> under two kinds, as inſtituted by our Saviour; our adverſaries hold it, to be a matter of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in it ſelf; and he that ſhall hold otherwiſe, will be acounted an heretick; and if he will not conforme to the practice of theſe days, eſtabliſhed by the Popes order and authority, he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for a ſchiſmatick. <hi>Nor do we grant poſſibility of Salvation to any</hi> (horrible words:) <hi>that out of privat heretical perſuaſions, hold it ought to be received by all: or out of contempt of the Churches order to the contrary,</hi>

            <p>Here, firſt it is apparent, that <hi>Gelaſius</hi> pronounces the receiving under one kind, to be receiving of a portion onely: and ſecondly that the Sacrament is not intire, or perfect, if either kind, (Bread or Wine) be omitted. Thirdly, and laſtly, that the diviſion of this myſtery (by receiving in one kind onely:) is <hi>grande ſacrilogium: great</hi> (or <hi>intolerable) ſacriledge.</hi> Is this plain, or no? Or if it be not, what words can be deviſed by the wit of man, that can be thought plain to a prepoſſeſſed mind, or reſolute obſtinacy? But let us hear. <hi>Bellarmines</hi> firſt evaſion, which he ſticks too, in his books <hi>De Rom.

But let any man ſoberly conſider with himſelf, whether it be probable, if <hi>Gelaſius</hi> wrote this of Prieſts particularly, whether he would have uſed ſuch an indefinite, unlimited word (<hi>quidam,</hi> and no more) as would in all probability, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61006:40"/>
otherwiſe, then he intended; eſpecially when this miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſence, muſt of neceſſity give great offence. But whether Prieſt, or people be intended; if that be yielded; what then? Doth not he ſay plainly, that they that receive in one kind, receive but a <hi>portion</hi>? That the <hi>Sacrament</hi> (not <hi>Sacrifice</hi>:) is not whole and entire; except it be received in both kinds? And laſtly, that this diviſion of it, is <hi>grande ſacrilegium</hi>? Are not his words abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and general, without any reſtriction, or limitation; as any can be deviſed or imagined? But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath another anſwer beſides, in his books <hi>De Euchariſtia:</hi> and that is <hi>Baronius</hi> his anſwer,<note place="margin">

            <p>But to return to <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> and his words: ſhould any now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the cup, out of any ſuch ſuperſtitious conceit; becauſe all uſe of wine, upon any occaſion, is vicious: what would his puniſhment be, to force him to take it under both kinds (the high priviledge of Prieſts and ſome Kings, if I be not miſtaken:) or to deny him the communion altogether, until he had renounced his ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition?</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, to make this matter more clear and evident: (though I think greater evidence then what hath already been produced, no man can reaſonably require: In the ſame <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> (as called) <hi>c.</hi> 7. there is a <hi>Decretum,</hi> or <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> as the title doth bear.

One is, that ſome had a cuſtom to dip the Bread in Wine, and ſo to give both kinds thus contrived in one, for the whole Euchariſt, which they called <hi>Intinctam Euchariſtiam. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> tells them, (<hi>Probatum in Evangelio teſtimonium non recipit:) It was contrary,</hi> or <hi>not agreeable to Chriſts Inſtitution: (ſeorſum enim panis, &amp; ſeorſum calicis commendatio memoratur:</hi>

            <p>May not we now, with all the confidence that cleareſt evidences and unqueſtionable records can breed in any man, conclude that Popes have contradicted one another in this point?

            <p>The Reverend Archbiſhop, and now bleſſed Martyr, had objected that by Chriſts Inſtitution, the Sacrament was adminiſtred in both kinds, and that his inſtitution and example had the force of a precept.

               <hi>To ſhew that the practices of the Church were contrary to Chriſts inſtitution, the Biſhop ſhould have made it appear, that Chriſt did ſo inſtitute this ſacrament of his laſt ſupper, that he would not have one part to be ſacrament, without the other: or, that he would not have one part to be taken without the other.</hi> What; though both kinds be acknowledged Chriſts <hi>inſtitution</hi>; and that <hi>inſtitution</hi> hath the force of a <hi>command,</hi> or <hi>precept</hi>; yet is all this nothing, except Chriſt have ſaid expreſly, <hi>that he would not have one part to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament without the other</hi>; or, <hi>that he would not have one part to be taken without the other?</hi> Why then, if I ſay to a thief, making profeſſion of Chriſtianity, it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal</hi>: may not he anſwer as well: yea, but ſhew me where it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal for thy need</hi>; or, <hi>when opportunity doth offer it ſelf:</hi> and ſo the adulterer, where it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, though thou haſt no wife of thine own</hi>; or, <hi>though the woman make ſome advantage of her adultery, which ſhe and her Children ſtand in need of</hi>; and the like.

expect in thoſe Fathers here quoted, to find ſomewhat expreſly, concerning communion in one kind? But if you look, not one word in any of them will you find, concerning one kind, or two: but this only, that thoſe Fathers are of opinion, that by thoſe words, <hi>breaking of bread,</hi> the Communion is intended. Now <hi>breaking of bread</hi> in common ſpeech among the Hebrews, implying <hi>drink</hi> alſo, as no man ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, or doubted, (as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in the Greek doth imply <hi>meat</hi> alſo, and the like in other languages:) to bring them for witneſſes, and to make them ſay peremptorily, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was adminiſtred in one kind by Chriſt; becauſe by <hi>breaking of bread,</hi> the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is intended: what kind of dealing is this? let the Reader judge. I ſhall add onely, that <hi>Maldonat,</hi> who doth earneſtly contend for this ſence, that by <hi>breaking of bread,</hi> the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is intended in this place, urging many reaſons, and alledging the very ſame Fathers their authority for it; yet of the Sacrament adminiſtred in one kind (which, had he ſeen any ground for it, he had not omitted, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly:) he hath not one word. Nay, thoſe words of his, <hi>fractionem pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, non ipſam actionem frangendi, ſed totum illum actum conficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, adminiſtrandique Euchariſtiam appellari:</hi> may be thought not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably, to imply the contrary, and to aime at ſome confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But why do I ſay, not improbably? For certain it is, that he could intend it no otherwiſe; and as certain, that the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> did not well underſtand what did belong unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Prieſt; if, as probably, he be a Prieſt. For though the Romaniſts do adminiſter unto the people under one kind: yet they do not hold that right conſecration of the Elements, that is not made under both. And therefore (as is well obſerved by a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Romaniſt, whom we ſhall name afterwards, who hath written a learned diſcourſe of this very ſubject;) Neither the Councel of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> nor that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> nor of <hi>Trent,</hi> by which Councels, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration under one kind was eſtabliſhed (or confirmed;) would make uſe of this place of Scripture to confirm their doctrine, or decree; as, wiſely foreſeeing what would be objected.

Eccleſiae privilegium—hic procul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubio in haereſin labitur:—hic est proculdubio dicendus haereticus.</hi> Now it is certain, that it is the Doctrine of the ancient Fathers (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally:) that nothing was given to St. <hi>Peter</hi> by theſe words, (but onely that it was given to him firſt, for <hi>unities</hi> ſake: in <hi>which ſence</hi> ſome ſay, <hi>ſoli Petro:</hi>) but was given to the reſt of the Apoſtles.

Proteſtants, it is propoſed as an Article of Faith; this may well go for one inſtance.</p>
            <p>But in the next place; What ſhall we ſay to <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII. who doth decree and declare, that if a Prince, or King be excommunicated, all his Subjects are diſcharged of their Oath; and not onely, ſo, but doth ſtrictly forbid, that any <hi>fidelity</hi> (or obedience) ſhall be performed unto them? His words are; <hi>Nos ſanctorum Praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſorum noſtrorum ſtatuta tenentes, eos qui excommunicatis, fidelitate aut ſacramento conſtricti ſunt; Apostolicâ auctoritate, a Sacramento abſolvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus; &amp; ne iis fidelitatem obſervent, omnibus modis prohibemus; quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque ipſi ad ſatisfactionem veniant.</hi> This is ſo punctual, that it will admit, (I think:) of no evaſion: And that this Doctrine is impious, heretical, deſtructive to all Kings, and Princes, hath been declared by divers Edicts of Kings and Princes, with the joynt concurrence of their Clergie, Biſhops, Archbiſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which is moſt horrible, beyond which profeſſed Atheiſme, and Infidelity cannot go; is that of <hi>Urban</hi> the Second, whereby he doth declare them to be no <hi>homicides,</hi> who <hi>through zeal</hi> for the Church, ſhall murther any man, (<hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> you may be ſure; who are moſt ſubject to thoſe Excommunications:) that ſtands excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.

as I told the Reader, at the beginning. Though therefore it be ſome digreſſion from the preſent matter; yet it is not beſides my firſt intention, and purpoſe. The queſtion is, about a place of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> where he doth uſe the word <hi>arbitramur</hi>; in what ſence there to be taken. Before we reſolve the queſtion, and produce <hi>Jeroms</hi> words; let us hear, what the ſaid Author of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> doth make of it, which may ſtand us in ſome ſtead upon this particular occaſion of Pope <hi>Urbanus</hi> his words.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 364.</note> [As for the word <hi>arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> (ſaith he) which the Relator catches at, as if S. <hi>Jerom</hi> thereby delivered onely his own private, and but conjectural opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and not any matter of Chriſtian belief; we anſwer, <hi>Arbitramur</hi> doth not alwayes ſignifie opinion, or doubts, but ſimply a mans ſence, and judgment, in whatſoever matter or queſtion propounded, as every common Lexicon might have informed him. Doth the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie no more then meer opinion, in that Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2. <hi>Non rapinam arbitratus eſt, eſſe ſe aequalem Deo?</hi> &amp;c. And would not the Biſhop (think you,) have been ſhrewdly put to it, to find a proof for juſtification by Faith onely, ſhould that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. have been wreſted from him in that manner: St. <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>here onely at his arbitramur,</hi> we think that a man is juſtified by Faith, without the works of the Law? He delivers not a point of Faith, but onely his private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>Thus he; and that this interpretation of the word <hi>arbitramur,</hi> doth very well agree to <hi>Urbanus,</hi> as Pope, that is, as ſupreme Judge, (ſo they would have it) in all ſuch cauſes; no man can doubt. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, what conſtruction ſoever we make of this <hi>arbitramur,</hi> is not much material, ſince his order and appointment how they ſhall be uſed, that have, or ſhall commit ſuch a thing; not as execrable murtherers, or parricides; but as men, who perchance in this act of Zeal, might have ſome other conſideration (as happily ſome private revenge, or expectation of reward, and the like,) beſides Zeal; and therefore ſome arbitrary petty penance, to be enjoyned them; and no more: this doth abſolutely pronounce them no murtherers, no parricides. And this is the Doctrine, all, or moſt that of late have attempted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſons of Kings, and Princes, have gone upon, and acted by.

            <p>In the year of our Lord 1524. or thereabouts, <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſaith <hi>Thuanus, (Charles</hi> the V.

            </p>
            <p>What the matter was in <hi>France,</hi> about the year 1640. others may know better then I, that were then in the Countrey, eye-witneſſes of what paſſed. Sure I am, that by Books then printed, it doth appear, that there was much talk of a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> then to be conſtituted: and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61006:48"/>
that it was verily believed, by many, that it would be ſo. Which gave occaſion to a Book, intituled, <hi>Apotrepticus, adverſus inanem Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati Galli ad Illuſtriſſ. &amp; Reverendiſſ. Eccleſiae Gallicanae Primates, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiep. Epiſcopos, Paraeneticam.</hi> A. D. 1640. written of purpoſe, and as I conceive, by authority; to allay the jealouſies of men; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent diſorders, that might probably enſue upon it. In that Book, among other things, you ſhall find notable inſtances, <hi>quantum diſtet a piâ Francorum erga R. Sedem obſervantiâ, faſtus &amp; contemptus Ibericus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Long before that, in the year 1626. was printed a Book or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in Paris, under this title; <hi>Cardinalium, Archiepiſcoporum, Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum, caeterorumque, qui ex univerſis Regni Provinciis, Eccleſiaſticis Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiis interfuerunt, de anonymis quibuſdam, &amp; famoſis libellis, ſententia. Lut. Paris. apud Anton. Steph.</hi> A. D. 1626. <hi>Cum privilegio Regis.</hi> In which, among other things, I find this clauſe, ſo contrary to the Popes, and Jeſuits doctrine, rhat nothing can be more: <hi>At injuſtam eſt, quod ad reſtituendam haereticum Principem (adde etiam infidelem:</hi> the Prince Palatine, that then was, is intended:) <hi>bellum ſuſceptum ſit. Infidelis ſit, ſed a Deo conſtitutus, a quo poteſtas omnis data eſt:</hi> &amp;c. This whole Book, or judgment, was inſerted (it had ſuch approbation:) in the <hi>Mercurius</hi> of thoſe times, and in a Book conſiſting of four Tomes, then printed, and intituled, <hi>Des affaires du Clergé de France:</hi> 1626. nay, it was inrolled in the publick Records, or Regiſters of the Kingdome. But the Jeſuitical party prevailing, this Book or <hi>Sentence</hi> was diſavow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and diſclaimed by a great part of the Clergie; and a large Book ſet out againſt it, <hi>Par Francois, Cardinal de la Rochefoucaut, Grand Auſmonier de France.</hi> However, it may eaſily appear by theſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, upon what doubtfull terms, the Popes authority ſtands in that Countrey; and how many enemies it hath. So that in very truth, this buſineſs of <hi>Infallibility</hi> aſcribed unto the Pope, is looked upon by the generality, rather as a device to amuſe the ſimple and credulous; then as a thing ſeriouſly to be entertained, by any that know how the world goes, and can diſcern between the inſide and outſide of things.</p>
            <p>If all this we have ſaid hitherto, be not enough to ſatisfie the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that it is ſo indeed, I will propoſe one inſtance more to his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; and, if that will not do it, I ſhall leave him, peaceably, to the liberty of his own judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61006:48"/>As we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (as many as go under that name) by the Sentence of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> partly for falſe doctrine, which they charge us with, in matters of Faith; but eſpecially, for not acknowledging the Pope our head, nor yielding obedience unto his commands; are proclaimed <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and ſolemnly <hi>anathematized,</hi> at certain times, in <hi>Rome,</hi> (as I take it:) So are the modern <hi>Grecians,</hi> though not for the ſame points of Doctrine, yet for others, and particularly, for not acknowledging the Supremacy of the Pope. And whereas the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Archbiſhop doth endeavour to free them from ſuch errours, ſo fundamental, as ſhould make them no Church;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>p</hi> 233.8.</note> 
               <hi>We have proved</hi> (ſaith he long after:) <hi>that the</hi> Greeks <hi>Errour in that point, is fundamental, and ſufficient to unchurch them.</hi> I make not any great wonder at it; for ordinarily they dare ſpeak of them no otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Popes ſentence. I ſaid ordinarily: but they dare when they pleaſe. Witneſs he (no obſcure man, <hi>Jacobus Goar, ordinis Fr. praedicat. S. Th. Lector; &amp; in Oriente Miſſus Apoſtolicus:</hi>) who hath ſet out in <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Euchologium,</hi> in Greek and Latin, with <hi>Annotations.</hi> In his Epiſtle to the Reader, he ſpeaks of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, in theſe words: <hi>Una eſt Orientalis Eccleſia; una eſt Occidentalis: unum Deum authorem omnium ſuſpicit, ac veneratur: pones externos venerationis ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, haec ab illa diſcrepat, quia unus ac idem operatur in ea Spiritus: Deus ergò Opt. Max. cum ſit omnium, quem utraque Eccleſia profitetur, objectum,</hi> &amp;c. I think this is plain language; it needs no Comment: a free and cleer vindication of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. Yet I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the Author, in the beginning of his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> was ſo wary, as to provide himſelf (if occaſion ſhould be:) a refuge, or evaſion; by a cautious <hi>Parentheſis; de primaeva illius aetate; vel de ſana, quae tempore hoc reſtat, heu modicâ licet, loquor:</hi> but it is apparent, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> he ſpeaks afterwards of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church in general; viſible, and conſpicuous, and commonly known, under that name. No other conſtruction (to make ſence of them:) can be made of his words. Yet for further evidence of the matter, and the better to prevent the ſubterfuges of brazen confidence; I referr the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61006:49"/>
Reader to the <hi>Approbations,</hi> (the two laſt of the three:) there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where the ſame thing is averred, without any limitation or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: <hi>Ut in Eccleſia Catholica (Eccleſia Orientalis, &amp; Occidentalis,</hi> the two Churches before mentioned:) <hi>cum rituum diverſitate, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum ſocietatem, vel potius unitatem eſſe, omnes intelligant.</hi> But the other, more cleerly, and fully; <hi>Ut omnes ſciant, Eccleſiam Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem &amp; Graecam, ſuos adhuc primaevos ritus, fideliter aſſervaſſe, nec ad ejus ſplendorem aliud deeſſe, quam Romanae fidei unitatem, &amp; cum Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano capite, adeò peroptatam unionem; quod annuente Ieſu Chriſto, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite Romanae, ſeu Graecae; praeſtabit iſtud opus,</hi> &amp;c. Here the <hi>Greek</hi> Church is acknowledged <hi>a Church,</hi> wanting nothing to full perfection or <hi>ſplendor,</hi> but unity with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> and under the ſame <hi>Head</hi>; but acknowledged a Church nevertheleſs, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one, and the ſame Head, Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this ſtrange Doctrine? Can any thing be more contrary to the <hi>definitions</hi> of Popes, and Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; then that any Church ſhould be acknowledged a <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which hath no dependance from the Pope? Is not this the very Doctrine of Proteſtants, ſo rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly condemned in them, and for which, more then any other point, they are branded as Hereticks, and Schiſmaticks? Now let the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſpeak, what reckoning thoſe men make of the Popes <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and his <hi>Definitions,</hi> that do ſo point-blank oppoſe them, and reject them, when they pleaſe. What the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this, were worth the knowing; if he be not one of them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who would have us to believe that; and that too, (to terrifie us, ſilly people, into a belief,) under pain of eternal damnation; which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thinks himſelf too wiſe to do, truly and really. The Book to which thoſe Approbations (made both by <hi>Readers,</hi> and <hi>Profeſsors in Divinity</hi>:) was printed in <hi>Paris,</hi> A. D. 1647.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer upon this point of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and made choice of that (as was partly ſaid already, in the <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader,</hi>) to inſiſt upon it before any other: or indeed, in this, inſtead of all the reſt: becauſe it is the point (of late years, eſpecially) moſt preſſed, as the Point of Points, and Article of Articles, by the Patrons of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Cauſe. As therefore the Reverend and bleſſed Archbiſhop ſaid well, ſpeaking of them of that party, <hi>If this be true</hi>; (that the Pope is <hi>infallible:) why do you not lay all your ſtrength together, all of your
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61006:49"/>
whole Society, and make this one Propoſition evident?</hi>

                  <hi>Relat. p</hi> 266.</note> 
               <hi>For all controverſies about matters of Faith are ended, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great trouble to the Chriſtian world; if you can but make this one Propoſition good, That the Pope is an infallible Judge:</hi> So, the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will hold with us Proteſtants alſo, why as many as deal in <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies,</hi> we ſhould make it our chief buſineſs, to make it <hi>good and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> that he is not.</p>
            <p>Now truly, I think they have done what they can, they have ſo applied themſelves to it, of late: and becauſe (it ſeems) upon accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate peruſal of former grounds and arguments, they begin, (as we may gueſs probably:) to miſtruſt, or to deſpair: ſome of them have deviſed new ways, new props and fences to uphold this tottering building, which were not thought of before: or at leaſt, diſuſed and laid aſide. Witneſs a Book entituled, <hi>Schiſme Diſpatcht: or a rejoynder to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes of Dr.</hi> Hammon, <hi>and the Lord of</hi> Derry, 1657. This man hath a way by himſelf, of his own deviſing; or reviving, at leaſt: though he ſend us to the <hi>Dialogues</hi> of one <hi>Ruſworth,</hi>

This I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: I never heard of ſuch an author: and it is poſſible, the better to cry himſelf up, (which is the artifice of ſome:) he might borrow ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name. But be they two, or one: if they go one way, we may ſpeak of them, as one, without wronging them. This author then; Popes, and Prelates, their teſtimonies he makes nothing of; nay, diſclaims them; as inſufficient proofs and evidences; (<hi>the bare words of a few particular men,</hi> ſo he ſpeaks of them:) <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Councels</hi> (in this buſineſs) he ſlights, as much:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 42.</note>
calls them in ſcorn, <hi>wordiſh teſtimonies</hi>; and gives you his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why he doth not account them good evidences: <hi>But I ſtand not upon this</hi> (ſaith he, ſuch kind of evidences:) <hi>having a far better game to play,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> and the teſtimonies of <hi>Fathers of Families</hi>; is the onely thing wherein he placeth <hi>Infallibility:</hi> which to make good, he hath ſo many chimerical ſuppoſitions, and doth ſo pleaſe himſelf in his impertinencies, as muſt needs beget wonder, in caſe the man (as probably) be of any account, and reputation in the world. For my part, by this extravagant kind of dealing, I cannot but ſuſpect of him, that he is one of the fraternity of the new (pretended) <hi>lights</hi>: no friend to ancient Books, or Learning. Woe to Colledges, and Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61006:50"/>
if they ſhould prevail: <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> and <hi>Mahometiſme</hi> will get well by it. Others, of approved worth and abilities, have met with this man; who I think have done him more credit, then he deſerved. I do not judg his parts: but I account his way ſo ridiculous, that I ſhould hardly have thought it worthy of an anſwer, or ſo much as notice.</p>
            <p>But ſince I have taken notice of this man, who doth leſs concern us; I muſt not omit to acquaint the Reader, what is done by the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> upon the ſame occaſion: who, though not in the ſame way, yet he alſo (upon the ſame occaſion) doth bewray not leſs diffidence and difficulty. For, being put to it by the Reverend Archbiſhop, he hath no remedy, but he muſt quit all thoſe pleas of <hi>Scripture</hi> and the reſt; (as neceſſary;) and wholly betakes himſelf to <hi>Motives of Credibility.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 55.</note> He ſaith plainly, other Arguments are but <hi>ad hominem ex principiis conceſſis,</hi> againſt Sectaries: and that the Church, <hi>without the help of the ſame, is ſufficiently proved to be infallible.</hi> Where the Reader may obſerve, how he confounds <hi>the Church,</hi> referring us to <hi>Bellarmine, de notis Eccleſiae</hi>; with the Churches <hi>Infallibility:</hi> it being one thing, to believe the being of a Church, upon ſome <hi>Motives of Credibility</hi> (in part:) and to believe, that the Church is abſolutely <hi>infallible.</hi> And again, one thing, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Catholick Church, in fundamentals neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, and to the conſtitution of a Church: (which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do generally grant and believe:) and to believe the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Pope, as Head of the Church; the onely thing, (as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before) all theſe goodly words and pretenſions drive at. A mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and well worthy the firſt place among the Articles of Faith; which to maintain, the aſſertors of it are put to ſo much ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and confuſion.</p>
            <p>Now ſhould a man go about to examine his <hi>motives of probability,</hi> as he doth marſhal them; <hi>ſanctity of life,</hi> and <hi>miracles</hi> in the front; <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy,</hi> &amp;c. I do admire, with what face, he durſt mention <hi>ſanctity of life,</hi> when ſo many of their own Authors have made known unto the world, the Epicurean, Atheiſtical lives of ſo many Popes, ſcarce to be parallel'd by any heatheniſh Hiſtory: whoſe examples (as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Paſtors, and Governors of the Church upon Earth, according to their opinion:) muſt needs be more conſiderable, and of more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61006:50"/>
to do good, or evil; generally: then the lives and ſanctities of thouſands, yea millions, which may not ſo eaſily be judged of: and if believed, of little conſideration, in compariſon. Beſides I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Reader to what hath already been ſaid, and ſhall be yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, of the atheiſtical life of their Clergy, by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>miracles:</hi> what will he anſwer to ſo many Fathers, who ſo often diſclaim them: and particularly, to St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>: as when he ſaith: <hi>Romoveantur iſta &amp;c.</hi> that is: <hi>Let theſe, either fictions of lying men, or prodigies of deceiving Spirits, be removed.</hi>

               <hi>For all thoſe things that are reported of that nature</hi> (by the Donatiſts and others who indeavoured to juſtifie their cauſe, by ſuch proofes) <hi>either they are not true; or if in very deed, ſome wonders have been done by ſome hereticks, we ought to take heed of them the more; ſince our Saviour, after he had warned us &amp;c.</hi> And a little after, <hi>What ſignes ſoever of that nature, are done in the Catholick Church, therefore they are (approbanda:) to be approved:</hi> (to be liked, and well thought of:) <hi>becauſe they are done in the Catholick Church: but the Church is not thereby proved,</hi> (or <hi>manifeſted) to be Catholick</hi> (or, a true Church) <hi>becauſe ſuch things are done in her.</hi> This muſt be underſtood of miracles, ſince miracles generally ceaſed. For of the miracles of the Old Teſtament, or done by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it is quite another caſe. And truly by what I have read; (who have been ſomwhat curious to ſatisfie my ſelf in this point: whereof I may perchance, give a further account to the world, at another time:) and by what I have learned by the relation of others, I am clear of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the pretended miracles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they make one good Chriſtian (and it muſt be ſome of the meaneſt ſort; or ſuch at leaſt, who naturally, are very credulous:) they make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more atheiſts. I will not ſay, of the better ſort of men; but, of the more rational, and intelligent, among them. I juſtifie them not; for their be other motives and conſiderations, to keep them in the Faith of Chriſt, if they made that their buſineſs. But we conſider men, as men. For when they ſee ſo much impoſture (though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable now, to what it was, before the <hi>reformation</hi>; men are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more wary, now:) ſo much fraud and juggling; (witneſs many of their own books and Authors:) on the one ſide: ſo much creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61006:51"/>
ſimplicity of others, who are ready to embrace any thing in that kind; who alſo build ſome kind of faith, and devotion upon ſuch things, without further examination: it muſt needs make them who look no further into the true grounds of Religion, and hear <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> (even of theſe times:) cried up, as a great Argument, or <hi>motive</hi> (as our Author would have it) of <hi>credibility</hi>; to think of Religion accordingly.</p>
            <p>Yet, for all this, I do not deny; nay, I verily believe, that in all places, at all times, (more, or leſs) ſome ſtrange things do happen from ſtrange cauſes; which may be called <hi>miraculous,</hi> or <hi>ſupernatural</hi> events, or <hi>operations</hi>; for which no reaſon from the ordinary courſe of nature, can be given: which <hi>ſupernatural operations</hi> having been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, not onely by the wiſeſt, and moſt religious of former times; but by the beſt, and moſt learned naturaliſts of this learned age (even ſince the reſtoration of learning:) whoſe profeſſion hath given them greateſt advantage and opportunity, to underſtand the truth of theſe things: I muſt look upon it, as an argument of great <hi>ignorance,</hi> or <hi>ſenſuality (Plato,</hi> the Philoſpher, will give the reaſon, why <hi>ſenſuality</hi>:) in any man to make a queſtion. So much for mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
            <p>I might proceed to his third motive: <hi>efficacie, puritie,</hi> and <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of Doctrine</hi>; (as he expreſſeth it:) and ſo to the reſt; were it not too much beſides my purpoſe. I ſhall only, in diſcharge of my conſcience, ſuch an opportunity offering it ſelf, declare the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions (not without much grief) of my mind, and moſt retired thoughts: that this one point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>worſhiping Images,</hi> as it is taught and practiſed (though practiſed much worſe, then taught: yet, even taught:) in moſt places, where Popery is eſtabliſhed; I verily believe, not in its ſelf onely, damnable; but the great and abominable ſcandal of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: for which, they that pretend to antiquity, may with as much colour, or reaſon pretend, that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was the work of ſome one of the ancient fathers; or, an abſtract of their Doctrine. By anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, I underſtand the firſt ſix hundred years. And my opinion is (by what I have found, at leaſt) that they, Proteſtants I mean, that read <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, (if men of any judgement:) upon this point, will rather be confirmed in their opinion, if they doubted before; then otherwiſe. Nay it is able to make a man a <hi>Protestant,</hi> that is not;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61006:51"/>
to ſee what wayes they go, what ſhifts they are put to, to maintain ſo wretched a cauſe.</p>
            <p>I have ſaid to his <hi>Motives,</hi> as much as I mean: that which I aim at, is to make the Reader ſenſible, what a ſad thing this <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> is, which by their Doctrine ſhould be the chiefeſt Pillar of the Church; the ground, and foundation whereof, is ſo full of uncertainty and contradiction. But yet I muſt not paſs by a manifeſt blaſphemy (as I apprehend it) of this ſubtil Architect of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi>; (a right Title to his Book, had he but left out <hi>Cantuarienſis:</hi>) where he ſaith: <hi>As therefore</hi> Moſes, <hi>our bleſſed Saviour, and his Apoſtles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr.</hi> p. 57.</note> 
               <hi>were proved infallible by their works, ſigns, and miracles, without Scripture: ſo is the Church</hi> (the preſent Church; for of the <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>primitive,</hi> there is no queſtion made) <hi>without help of the ſame, ſufficiently proved infallible, by the motives of credibility:</hi> doth not he thereby aſcribe as much to the <hi>miracles</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church (the <hi>Roman,</hi> as he names it:) as to the <hi>miracles</hi> and <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? If this can be excuſed, I am well content: I would not make him worſe, then he is; I profeſs, I do not ſee, how it can.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ſuch as is avouched by the more ſober: Of all points of Popery, which we believe erroneous; this we have reaſon to account the moſt odious, and intolerable; becauſe by it, we are put off from all hopes of peace and reconciliation, in Religion: which they that do not wiſh heartily, and daily, privatly, publickly; according to their places and profeſſions, pray for fervently; they know as yet but little of true Chriſtianity. For what grief of heart muſt it be to a true Chriſtian, to ſee the Church of Chriſt, the body of Chriſt, ſo divided, and ſet againſt it ſelf; Church, againſt Church; member, againſt member; with all fierceneſs, and animoſity: whereby ſo much advantage is given to <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> abroad; to Atheiſme and profaneneſs, even where Chriſt is profeſſed?</p>
            <p>Truly, my judgment is: He that looks into many of our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, not as they are ſtated, and aggravated by too many, on both ſides: but into the true nature of the differences, as ſtated by the more ſober and moderate: he will not apprehend ſuch an impoſſibility of reconciliation, as the prejudice of ſome, and the intereſt of others, would make us believe: but confeſs, that in ſome points of greateſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61006:52"/>
conſequence, the difference is more in words, and ſpeeches; then in reality of matter: for which I appeal to the <hi>Acta Ratisbon.</hi> A. D. 1541. and what <hi>Phil. Melanchton, Bucer,</hi> and other <hi>German</hi> Divines, have written of the ſame ſubject. However, if not a perfect <hi>reconciliation</hi>; yet a charitable, and brotherly <hi>toleration,</hi> (ſo far as may ſtand with the peace and ſafety of every place:) though in a different external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, would be comfortable. But as long as this Doctrine of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> under the pretence whereof, groſſeſt untruths and abuſes are, and muſt be countenanced; what hopes? what poſſibility? Great reaſon therefore, that we ſhould apply our ſelves moſt to that, and bend all our ſtrength and forces againſt it, to make all men ſenſible, (if poſſible) how little there is of truth, or probability, in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at large: but to make it an Article of Faith, a Fundamental of Chriſtian Religion, neceſſary to ſalvation, without which, all other Faith, or belief, is but Infidelity; how much of horror, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety!</p>
            <p>But what then? if no <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the Church; (I would not leave any thing unanſwered, that I think fit to be taken notice of:) what becomes of Chriſts promiſe, that he would build his Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Rock,</hi> againſt which the <hi>gates of Hell</hi> ſhould not prevail:) Is there nothing of <hi>Infallibility</hi> in this? Yes, ſurely, as long as there is a Church, a Catholick Church, there muſt be ſome <hi>infallibility:</hi> For if the Church fail, in the main fundamentals, it ceaſeth to be a Church. The <hi>Rock</hi> upon which Chriſt promiſed to build his Church, according to the interpretation of moſt Ancients, is <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; or which is equivalent,<note place="margin">Matth. xvj.16.</note> 
               <hi>Peter's</hi> Confeſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he was <hi>Chriſt</hi> (the Meſſias:) <hi>the Son of the living God.</hi> This we ſay, is the <hi>Rock</hi> eſpecially, and preciſely, againſt which Chriſt hath promiſed, <hi>the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail:</hi> which hath been proved before, by many teſtimonies. And do not we ſee the accompliſhment of it, in all parts of the world, where Chriſt is profeſſed, with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Is it not ſtrange, and (but through the mighty power of God,) incredible, that the Catholick Church, being ſo divided into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny factions, and profeſſions; ſo many different opinions, maintained with ſo much eagerneſs and animoſity, as greater between greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies can hardly be conceived; yet all agree (ſome very few excepted, if any:) in this main Fundamental; as here delivered by St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:61006:52"/>
and all the neceſſary conſequences of it. The ſame Goſpel every where; the ſame Creeds; and the ſame Canons of the four firſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councels; which Councels, (the firſt, third, and fourth at leaſt) were chiefly called upon this very occaſion, to ſettle the right belief (though ſufficiently declared in the Scripture, in the ſubſtance of it, neceſſary to ſalvation:) of this Article of Chriſts perſon, againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; ſo that it is not poſſible to deviſe any thing againſt the true Faith in that point, but may eaſily be found and convicted by what hath been determined by thoſe Councels, and their Creeds. And I cannot look upon it otherwiſe, then as a Providence, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and their adherents, are ſo vehemently ſet for the maintenance of their opinions; whereof the chiefeſt, is the Popes Supremacy, and Infallibility, as grounded chiefly upon thoſe words of Chriſt (before cited) <hi>Upon this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it:</hi> they ſhould never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs (as already intimated) with many ancient Fathers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, apply them to the Creed and the contents of it. <hi>Quare Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolum fidei, quo ſancta Rom.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61006:53"/>
and intire: and in the profeſſion of this Doctrine, and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Catholick Church, under one Head Chriſt Jeſus, the true unity of the Church chiefly conſiſteth. That of <hi>Campegius,</hi> whom we have mentioned once or twice already; (he was one of their own Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops:) <hi>Tria ſunt, quibus non praeeſt, ſed ſubeſt Papa: credenda; ſcilicet, articuli fidei: agenda, praecepta moralia; medicamenta, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta: His ſtantibus, quae tollere non poteſt Papa, non labitur fides, nec Eccleſia, licet ipſe labatur.</hi> This is the ſummary (made by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) of what is more largely delivered by him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. §. 18. of his Treatiſe, <hi>De poteſtate Romani Pontificis:</hi> wherein he ſhews himſelf very zealous for the Pope and his authority. But if it be ſo, as he ſaith, (as indeed it is:) what need is there of this <hi>Infallibility,</hi> ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for? But we have ſaid enough of that before. All we intend here, is this onely, what <hi>Infallibility</hi> it is, that we maintain, well wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the notice, and obſervation, (and of Gods providence therein, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Church:) of all men; grounding it with antiquity upon the texts of Scripture, upon which they would ground the Popes <hi>Infallibility.</hi>

This hath ſome appearance of plauſibility, or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, at firſt hearing; but upon further ſearch and inquiry, it hath nothing in it, but bare appearance.

               </gap>ned by his Apoſtles, <hi>Oportet eſſe haereſes: There muſt be Hereſies.</hi> Might we be as bold with God Almighty, as our Adverſaries, (whoſe words have been produced at the beginning:) we might perchance reaſon with him, whether it were ſo ſuitable to his Wiſdom, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, and Providence, to permit it. But God forbid we ſhould take that liberty. We acknowledge his Goodneſs, yea and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he would warn us ſo long before, that we might not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or be diſmayed at it: We think our ſelves bound to do what lieth in us, according to our places, and callings, to hinder it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it: but withal, as much our duty, to ſubmit with humility, when it doth ſo happen. Do not we ſee, how it fared in the beginning with Chriſts Church; in thoſe infant-days of it, when, if ever, a man would have thought it ſhould have been moſt ſecure? Neither
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61006:53"/>
indeed, was <hi>infallibility,</hi> then, wanting; certain <hi>infallibility,</hi> as long as any of the Apoſtles lived; which was for a long time: yet for all that, when were there more diviſions, more hereſies; either for the fervency of the abettors, or for the quality of the Doctrine more ſcandalous and offenſive? And at the ſame time, the perſecutions of Infidels, as hot, and deſtructive: thoſe, in the bowels of the Church; theſe, round about; raging, and ſpoiling; and every day threatning utmoſt ruine and deſtruction. And this, not for a ſhort time, but for ſome hundred of years after Chriſt. Where was then Providence? if we ſhould go upon the ſame grounds our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries do; we might ſay. But providence we acknowledg; great providence; thoſe very hereſies, did conduce to the ſettlement of the Doctrine of faith; and the Church Catholick was enlarged by thoſe perſecutions and devaſtations: <hi>The blood of Martyrs was the ſeed of the Church</hi>: (as of old well obſerved:) and was not this a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous providence, and an effect of Gods mighty power, and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency? Why then may not we truſt the ſame power, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? Why muſt <hi>infallibility</hi> be granted; or all yeilded to be loſt? But ſure enough it is; peace and unity (goodly pretences to work upon them, that wiſh well; but had rather believe, then take the pains to ſearch:) may be alledged; but they that have eyes and will make uſe of them, ſee well enough what it is, that is aimed at. Let <hi>ſupremacy</hi> be but granted (ſuch as is required, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged:) I dare ſay, the Plea of infallibility, will ſoon be quitted; if the quitting of the one will conduce, to the obtaining of the other.</p>
            <p>This of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> I, a little before, took notice of; puts me in mind, of ſomwhat I obſerved long ago; and becauſe I have the books by me; (which I wiſh I could ſay, of all I have had) at preſent, I will acquaint the Reader with it. It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, but ſome may be affected with it, as I was. I have a French Bible, in two volumns in 8<hi rend="sup">vo</hi>. printed at <hi>Rouen,</hi> in <hi>France, par Jean Crevel, au Portail des Labraires</hi>:) <hi>A. D.</hi> 1611. It is a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, as the title page doth bear, of the Latin Bible ſet out by the <hi>Theologues,</hi> or Divines of <hi>Lovain,</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi> In this edition of the ſaid French tranſlation, after the licenſe, or approbation; and a Latin Epiſtle of one <hi>Jacobus de Bay</hi>; who in the firſt lines doth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Sacri Concilij Tridentini Patres</hi>; and doth alſo give the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61006:54"/>
an account, that this tranſlation out of the Latine was made, or at leaſt, reviſed by ſome <hi>Theologues</hi> of <hi>Lovain:</hi> and after St. <hi>Jerome</hi> his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to <hi>Paulinus,</hi> concerning the books of the Bible, which is uſally ſet out before all Bibles of the Vulgar edition: there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſmall parcel, not conſiſting of above three or four pages (but in a ſmall Print) entituled, <hi>A Summary of all, contained in the Old and New Teſtament.</hi> The contents of the Old, as there compriſed, are not many: but of the New, they are long enough, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain many particulars, beſides thoſe that concern Chriſts perſon and his office. It concludes in theſe words: <hi>Other foundation then this, no man can lay in the Church of Jeſus Chriſt, upon whom</hi> (or, <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which:) it is founded: ſo that St.</hi> Paul, <hi>doth wiſh him loſt, ſunk, and caſt away by God</hi> (or, <hi>from God,) yea, though it were an Angel of Heaven, who ſhall preach any other Faith, or ſalvation, then by Jeſus Chriſt, in the Catholick Church.</hi> There is not one word there, but a Proteſtant may ſubſcribe unto, with a good conſcience: Nay, had any Proteſtant Doctor been to make ſuch a Summary, (as I doubt not, but ſome have had occaſions) I do not know how he could do it more pertinently, more ſubſtantially, to ſatisfie the moſt judicious and intelligent of that profeſſion. A ſtrange thing, that for all this, we muſt be thought no better, then miſcreants and infidels. But then comes in this new diviſed <hi>article,</hi> which certainly was hatcht in hell, and foſtered by the ſuries of hell; by men, who care not how many they ſend to hell (according to that horrid ſpeech of one of the Popes Vaſſals, entered into the body of the Canon Law, <hi>That though the Pope ſhould be never ſo wicked and by his wicked example,</hi>

otherwiſe advantage the dead: and other like points propoſed unto us by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be believed as matters of Faith; with like aſſurance, as we believe that Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners; though otherwiſe never ſo orthodox, and in our lives, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo upright and innocent (as men:) yet all this will do no good: to hell we muſt: the Pope who is infallible, hath ſo decreed it. But do all Romaniſts think themſelves bound to believe it really?</p>
            <p>What <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> did aim at, or who ſet him at work, or whether he himſelf (as moſt likely:) more then can be gathered by any man, from his own profeſſion and manner of dealing, I know not. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this advantage we may make of his book, intituled <hi>Deus, Natura, Gratia</hi>: as the third edition <hi>Lugduni, A. D,</hi> 1631. which hath the approbation of ſo many Doctors of that ſide, doth repreſent it: We may learn by it, if we knew it not before, that it is not the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all the Roman Catholicks, that there is no ſalvation to be had in the faith and communion of Proteſtants: which is ſo confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed by the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth.</hi> Yet to do him, and others of that confederacy no wrong, though ſometimes they are very peremptory, and make great uſe of their confidence among women eſpecially, and other illiterate people, when they maintain without exception, that there is no ſalvation for Proteſtants,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 301.302.</note> that live and die in that belief: yet they can mince them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when they pleaſe, and change it into <hi>few,</hi> or <hi>none</hi>; as our Author ſpeaks; and again, <hi>except in caſe of invincible ignorance</hi>: which doth much alter the caſe, and gives hopes to every Proteſtant, that is verily perſwaded, nor ever made any queſtion (though ever willing to be better informed, and in caſe of error, to embrace the truth;) of his being in the right way; that he may be one of thoſe <hi>few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſince we are upon a conſiderable point, whereof, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Romaniſts uſe to make great advantage; I deſire to pauſe upon it a while, and take a view of thoſe reaſons given by the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lab. p.</hi> 301 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> why the Roman Church and Religion, muſt upon our own grounds, be the <hi>ſafer way to heaven.</hi> I am very confident the Reader will acknowledg, it was well worth the while, if not give me thanks, when I have done. Firſt then, for the ſalvation <hi>of many,</hi> in their communion, upon our
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61006:55"/>
grounds, he doth thus argue: <hi>In the Catholick Church, 'tis evident, that many being to depart out of this life, do receive the Sacrament of Pennance. Theſe, according to che Doctrine of the Roman Church, are ſaved; becauſe by vertue of this Sacrament they receive the grace of juſtification, whereby of Sinners, they are made the Sons of God, and Heirs of Eternal life: nor can they be denyed to be ſav'd according to the Doctrine of Proteſtants, ſeeing they believe in Chriſt their Redeemer, they confide in Gods goodneſs and mercie, for the pardon of their ſins; they truly repent of them, and truly purpoſe for the future, to amend their lives: which is all that Proteſtant Doctrine requires, to make men partakers of Chriſts ſanctifying grace: and is alſo neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Catholicks, to make them fit ſubjects for the Sacrament of Pennance. Who can therefore doubt, but all ſuch perſons are ſaved, both according to the Doctrine of Catholicks and Proteſtants too? I ſay who can rationally, and with charity doubt, but that Catholiques (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking) being taught, that Faith, Hope, true Repentance for ſins paſt, and a Purpoſe of amendment, are neceſſary to the due receiving of the Sacrament of Pennance; do not omit to exerciſe thoſe acts, with all neceſſary diligence and ſincerity, eſpecially, when they are to prepare themſelves, againſt the dreadful paſſage of eternity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſet down the paſſage at large, that the Reader might be the better ſatisfied. Now, if I be not miſtaken, here is not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous onely, but horrible Doctrine delivered; giving ſuch vertue to the <hi>opus operatum</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament of Pennance</hi> (as they call it) that whoever are made partakers of it, at the point of death, though they ſpend all their life, in all manner of debauchery, and villany: in open defiance of almighty God, and all laws of men, as long as they live; and by their example, and allurements, undoe never ſo many: Yet, if they receive but the <hi>Sacrament of Pennance,</hi> before they die; they are ſure of <hi>juſtification,</hi> and life eternal: what encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, may this be to the wickedeſt of men, to continue in wickedneſs? that I ſay not, to the beſt of men, to become wicked. I do not make any queſtion, but Gods mercies may extend even to ſuch; (God forbid, I ſhould:) even at the laſt, if they repent them truly: but to promiſe them, to warrant them before hand, that by the bare (if all the reſt doth infallibly follow) performance of the outward act, they may be ſure, and ſecure, that God will
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61006:55"/>
give them grace, truly, and effectually to repent: (for he doth not propoſe it conditionally, <hi>in caſe they truly reptnt,</hi> &amp;c. but abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, theſe; without any exception:) I would not willingly believe that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would countenance ſuch wretched Doctrine: Sure I am, it is very contrary to the Doctrine of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. We do not think that, <hi>to believe</hi>; or, <hi>to repent</hi>; truly, and really; is a meer voluntary thing; which a man, by any outward performance, hath at his command, when he will. We have not ſo learned the Scriptures. And I am ſure it is contrary, (this of <hi>Pennance</hi> particularly, as always accompanied with <hi>true repentance, and juſtification</hi>; and conſequently, <hi>ſalvation</hi>:) to the Doctrine of the ancients. Witneſs for one <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi>: (or whoever is the Author:) <hi>Si quis autem poſitus in ultima neceſſitate aegritudinis ſuae, voluerit accipere poenitentiam, &amp; accipit, &amp; mox reconciliabitur, &amp; hinc vadit; fateor vobis, non illi negamus quod petit; ſed non praeſumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, quia bene hinc exit.

Agens poenitentiam ad ultimum, &amp; recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliatus; ſi ſecurus hinc exit, ego non ſum ſocurus — poenitentiam dare poſſum, ſecuritatem dare non poſſum. — Numquid dico, dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabitur? Non dico. Sed dico etiam liberabitur? Non. Et quid dices mihi? Non praeſumo: non promitto: neſcio.</hi> What can be more contrary then this is, to the Doctrine of the <hi>Labyrinth?</hi> He ſaith plainly, and repeats it again, and again (to make men the more ſenſible) that a man at his death, if he deſire it, may obtain <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>; and may be <hi>reconciled,</hi> by the outward act: but whether really, effectually; he knows not, he doubts it; Yea, though the party be ſecure, he cannot be ſecure. So in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> if any before death, upon confeſſion, and profeſſion of true ſorrow, and repentance, receive abſolution; we hope well, in the judgment of charity: nay, we make no queſtion, if their repentance before God was true, and ſincere: their truſt and confidence in God, through Chriſt, and in Chriſt; by right application of his merits, and ſatisfaction; ſound and perfect: no queſtion, but all is well. But to paſs an abſolute judgment; we leave that to the judg and ſearcher of hearts: and have too much occaſion to believe, that many; very many, (through Gods juſt judgment, for their long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61006:56"/>
of the means, and his grace:) are deluded at that time, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading themſelves that they repent, (it is likely, moſt do, after a ſort, when they ſee they muſt die) and that they have made their peace with God; when God knows there is no ſuch thing. The Author therefore of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> doth much wrong the Reverend Archbiſhop, when he would put it upon him, that he was of the ſame mind, for ſaying that a <hi>Donatiſt (an honeſt plain Donatiſt</hi>; thoſe are the Biſhops words; by which he means certainly, one that hath lived in the fear of God:) if he repent truly of his ſins, &amp;c. might be ſaved. This he might ſay; but the inference very falſe, that therefore he believed, a man might repent truly, when he liſted. If this be the Romaniſts, their readieſt way to ſalvation, becauſe they truſt to their <hi>pennance,</hi> at the point of death; when they can ſin no longer; there is no occaſion we ſhould envy them: but rather wiſh heartily, God would make them more ſenſible of their errors and danger.</p>
            <p>But now let us ſee (which indeed I did chiefly intend:) how he doth prove, <hi>very few</hi>; or <hi>no Proteſtants,</hi> living and dying in that faith, can be ſaved. And firſt of all (for which we muſt commend his moderation) he doth wave that part of our charge, or indictment,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 302.303.</note> upon which moſt others go; that we are <hi>hereticks: Not that this is a point of our belief</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that many Proteſtants ſhall be damned preciſely, upon the account of being hereticks; becauſe hereſie is an obſtinate, and wilfull error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt faith, which we cannot eaſily, much leſs infallibly determine, whoſe errors are wilfull: but, becauſe there are none, or ſurely very few among them, but are guilty of mortal ſin, againſt Gods commandements; and becauſe the ordinary means they uſe and preſcribe, is not according to our Principles, ſufficient to expiate, and blot out ſuch ſin. 'Tis well known, that though Proteſtants to obtain ſalvation, believe in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> truſt in his merits, and repent of their ſin</hi>; (God be thanked ſo much is acknowledged:) <hi>yet they do it not purely out of a perfect love to God, ſo as to hate ſin above all evils, meerly as it is an offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Divine Majeſty, and to prefer God and his holy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, before our ſelves, and all other creatures (for this is a very hard and rare act, even among the beſt of Chriſtians) but at beſt, upon inferior and lower motives (as the manner of moſt men is to do)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:61006:56"/>
viz. in conſideration of the Beatitude of Heaven, as it is their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular good; or, for the avoiding of the pains of Hell, as it is their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and chiefeſt harm. Now according to our Doctrine, ſuch kind of repentance as this, is no ſufficient remedy, to blot out ſin, unleſs it be joyn'd with the Sacrament of Pennance, viz. Confeſſion, and Prieſtly Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which Proteſtants reject. I ſay, without the Sacrament of Pennance, actually and duely received, all Catholicks hold, that neither Faith, nor Hope, nor any Repentance, or ſorrow for ſin, can ſave us, but that onely, which is joyned with a perfect love of God, whereby we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to loſe all, and ſuffer all that can be imagin'd, rather then to offend God; yea, though there were indeed, neither Heaven to reward us, nor Hell to puniſh us; which being a thing ſo hard to be found; eſpecially amongſt ſuch as believe a man is juſtified by Faith onely; it follows evidently, that in our Doctrine, very few, or no Proteſtants are ſaved. The concluſion therefore is undeniable, that our Church is a ſafer way to ſalvation, then that of Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could not tell how to expreſs him better, then in his own words; and my deſire is, that he may be perfectly underſtood; that ſo the Reader may judge the better of what I have to anſwer. The matter we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is of great weight; and the reaſon here uſed, not ordinary. The ſubſtance of all he ſaith, as I take it, is this: That which muſt bring us to Heaven, muſt be, either a <hi>perfect Love of God:</hi> &amp;c. or the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Pennance:</hi> viz. <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Prieſtly Abſolution,</hi> &amp;c. but neither of theſe, (or very rarely:) is found amongſt Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Here again, in the firſt place, I muſt ſay, If it be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>opus operatum</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> (ſo called) which they that have lived in perpetual contempt of God, and all Religion, may have before they die, if they deſire it; is equivalent to that perfect kind of Love of God, by him deſcribed, which few in this world (he ſaith himſelf) attain unto; and equally available to ſalvation: it is a horrible Doctrine, tending to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all piety and godlineſs among men. I will not further diſpute it now: let the ſober Reader conſider.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is falſe, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> (and I believe it may be ſaid of moſt other Proteſtant Churches:) hath not the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (take the word in a large ſence, we ſhould not contend about it:) <hi>of Pennance:</hi> viz. <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Abſolution.</hi> Witneſs that excellent

Rubrick of the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> Book, in <hi>the Viſit. of the Sick: Here ſhall the ſick perſon be moved to make a ſpecial confeſſion of his ſins, if he feel his conſcience troubled with any weighty matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After which confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Prieſt ſhall abſolve him (if he humbly and heartily deſire it) after this ſort.</hi> So, now; and ſo, before, in the former Books; with very little alteration of words.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whereas he layeth it to the charge of all Proteſtants in general, that what they do, they do it not out of <hi>a perfect love of God,</hi> &amp;c. had he ſaid no more then <hi>perfect Love of God</hi>; we ſhould not much oppoſe it; for who is it, that dares affirm of himſelf, or of any other, that he <hi>loveth God perfectly?</hi> There is indeed a new kind of Divinity, lately much cried up by ſome, commonly known by the name of <hi>Theologia Myſtica:</hi> which doth pretend to great perfection. But of that Divinity; the original, and qualities of it, (as having more of deluſion in it, then perfection:) we have had occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider elſewhere: whither I ſhall referr the Reader, if he pleaſe.<note place="margin">Treatiſe of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſme,</hi> ch. 3.</note> But for ſuch perfection of love, as he doth here deſcribe, and doth appropriate to his own party; is it not a ſpeech both preſumptuous, and uncharitable in a high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſo peremptory to make Proteſtants incapable of it? Doth he not thereby arrogate unto himſelf, what is proper to God onely, to judge of the hearts of men?</p>
            <p>But is it not ſtrange, that he that could ſee the very thoughts and hearts of Proteſtants, whom he was leſs acquainted with: ſhould be a ſtranger to the publiſhed ſpeeches and declarations of his own friends, and fellows, in this buſineſs? For firſt, <hi>Cor. Janſenius,</hi> a man (were it but by the hatred, and oppoſition of the Jeſuits:) well known: he layeth it to the charge of Proteſtants, this very thing, (the want whereof, is here objected unto them:) that by their Doctrine, they do not allow of any acts of juſtice, or piety, to be acceptable to God; which are grounded upon the conſideration of a <hi>reward</hi>: (that is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which do not proceed from <hi>pure love</hi>:) to which he doth oppoſe the exhortations of Chriſt, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.12. <hi>for great is your reward:</hi> and elſewhere. And the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning <hi>Moſes,</hi> Hebr. xj.26. <hi>for he had a reſpect unto the recompence of the reward.</hi> And of <hi>David, I have inclined my heart to perform thy ſtatutes always:</hi> It is in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">

Muis,</hi> the late learned Profeſſor of the Tongues in <hi>Paris,</hi> likes it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo: <hi>propter retributionem</hi>; ſo the Vulgar; which is not amiſs; (<hi>Pſal.</hi> xix.12. <hi>for in keeping of them, there is great reward:</hi> rhe ſame word in both places:) but that is not our buſineſs. As <hi>Janſenius,</hi> ſo <hi>Ludovicus Tena,</hi> a very famous man, upon <hi>Hebr.</hi> xij.2. <hi>Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Jeſus — who for the joy that was ſet before him,</hi> &amp;c. he alſo chargeth the Lutherans with the ſame, as contrary to ſound Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But again, <hi>Bellarmin, de Poenit.</hi> lib. 2. c. 17. <hi>Contritionem imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectam, ſive attritionem ex timore poenae ortam, bonam atque utilem eſſe:</hi> (that is the argument of the Chapter:) he layeth it to the charge of <hi>Luther,</hi> and other <hi>Lutherans</hi>; that they did once teach that contrition, which ariſeth from a <hi>ſervile fear,</hi> made men but hypocrites; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added to their guilt, then took away. Himſelf, both by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſundry teſtimonies of the Fathers; doth prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>By this that hath been ſaid, let the Reader judge, whether this man had any reaſon to deny Proteſtants, a poſſibility of Salvation, becauſe they ſerve God onely with a <hi>ſervile fear:</hi> for that is the effect of his words. As for that he doth add, <hi>That without the Sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, actually and duely received, all Catholicks hold, that neither Faith, nor Hope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yea, though there were indeed neither Heaven to reward us, nor Hell to puniſh us:</hi> &amp;c. how this doth agree with <hi>Bellarmine; Contritionem charitate formatam, reconciliare hominem, etiam antequam actu Sacramentum ſuſcipiatur:</hi> and again, <hi>Extra Sacramentum facile fieri poſſe, at ſine confeſſione &amp; ſatisfactione, per internam cordis poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam quis juſtificetur:</hi> but eſpecially with that <hi>De Poenit.</hi> l. 2. c. 17. where ſpeaking of divers kinds of <hi>fears,</hi> he hath theſe words: <hi>Tertius eſt timor poenae, quem Deus ipſe peccatoribus comminatur, ſed cum timore offenſionis divinae, ita conjunctus, ut licet homo vehementer poenam ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat; magis tamen offenſionem Dei, quam poenam illam timeat. Atque hic timor ſervilis dici ſolet, ſecundum ſubſtantiam, ſed abſque ſervitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> &amp;c. and this he proves to have been the fear of holy men, and Saints.</p>
            <p>And it is the ſame reaſon of that, which they call <hi>amor ſervilis,</hi> or <hi>mercedis intuitu</hi>; which many call ſcornfully, but fooliſhly, <hi>mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry love.</hi> What our Author thinks of it, he hath told us. But how

will he reconcile himſelf to the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> (could he be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it?) which peremptorily doth define this Doctrine, to be contrary to true Religion; and doth anathematize them, that make it ſinfull for a juſtified man to have a reſpect, in what he doth well, unto the reward? Hear their own words: <hi>Unde conſtat eos orthodoxae religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis doctrinae adverſari—qui ſtatuunt in omnibus operibus juſtos pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, ſi in illis ſuam ipſorum ſocordiam excitando—cum hoc, ut im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primis glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Truly, my opinion is, and this opportunity being given me, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it; they that will not allow us to have a <hi>reſpect unto the reward,</hi> (whether Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſts, or Proteſtants: for I cannot but acknowledge, that I have heard ſuch things delivered out of Pulpits, more then once:) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that they muſt forbid us the reading of the Scriptures, where it is ſo often recommended: they would do well to take it into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that this one ſpeech of one of the ancient Maſters of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as it is recorded in their Talmud, <hi>Be not ye as hired ſervants, that ſerve their Maſters for a reward,</hi> &amp;c. was that which firſt gave ground, to the Sect of the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who made that conſtruction of their Maſters words, that if no reward muſt be looked for, or aimed at; then none to be believed, to either good, or bad; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no reſurrection, no immortality. Such Doctrine, I doubt, is more likely to produce ſuch fruits, then to advance true piety, and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. As for ſome ſayings of ancient Fathers, that may ſeem to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance it, they may eaſily be anſwered; and it will appear a great miſtake, if the matter be throughly examined, and the <hi>homonymie,</hi> or ambiguity of words cleared. I have done it elſwhere: but that is not our buſineſs here.</p>
            <p>I did think it well worth the Readers notice, and conſideration, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what account (chiefly) the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> whom we muſt ſuppoſe to be no mean man by his undertaking (if he were not ſet on, and made choice of by others; as is very probable) againſt ſuch a work; doth maintain the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, to be the ſafeſt way; the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61006:58"/>
plea of <hi>hereſie</hi> againſt Proteſtants, being laid aſide, and in his judgment, not pleadable, or juſtifiable: in which account, if our Author (as I think he is:) be groſly, and fouly miſtaken; then I hope they will be more wary hereafter, how they deny Proteſtants heaven, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs it to themſelves, and their party.</p>
            <p>As for his ſecond Argument, whereby he doth undertake to prove, that <hi>Proteſtants ſtanding to their own Principles, neither have, nor can have any thing neceſſary for ſalvation</hi>; and this upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their <hi>faith is not firme, ſure, and without doubt, or heſitation</hi>; or in a word <hi>infallibly ſure:</hi> becauſe it hath been the cheifeſt ſubject of all our debate hitherto, to prove their <hi>infallibility,</hi> a meer ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that we ſtand upon the ſame ground, as antiquity hath done: it will be needleſs further to inſiſt upon it. When they have anſwered what is oppoſed againſt them, and alledged for us, out of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi> (which one Author having had that approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their ſide, generally, as it hath had; they cannot in reaſon refuſe, to be tried by him:) and others; we ſhall think our ſelves bound to give them a further anſwer.</p>
            <p>Theſe two arguments, in caſe it be not yeilded, (as he ſaith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Proteſtants will not) that ſalvation may be had in the Roman Communion, our Author thinks <hi>ſufficient,</hi> to prove the Roman faith, <hi>the ſafer</hi> of the two. But in caſe it be yielded by Proteſtants, that ſalvation (which they will not yield to us in ours:) may be had in their Church, then without any more adoe, he thinks that, a very clear, and undeniable proof, that theirs is the ſafeſt way. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am one of them, who verily believe, and think it very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, (as afterwards we ſhall have more occaſion to argue:) to be believed by all men, who build their faith upon certain grounds: that the Roman Church, is yet, a true Church,<note place="margin">

as to the eſſence of a Church; and conſequently, that it is poſſible for them, who erre ignorantly, with other limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations fully declared by the Reverend Archbiſhop; to attain ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſaid Church: I think fit to ſay ſomewhat to that too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave this argument, which to them that content themſelves with a meer ſuperficial view (whether for want of parts, or care:) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth moſt plauſible; and which our adverſaries, make moſt uſe of, as their beſt weapon.</p>

                  <hi>Relat. p.</hi> 285. <hi>&amp;</hi> 296.</note>Now firſt of all, to take away much of the plauſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, the Reverend Archbiſhop, as divers had done before, doth well repreſent by a clear teſtimony out of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that this very way, thoſe notorious ſchiſmaticks, the Donatiſts of old, did go. <hi>Come to us, come</hi> (ſaid the Donatiſts:) <hi>all ye that will not periſh for ever, with your falſe teachers. Would you be ſure, that we are in the right, and they in the wrong? Behold, they acknowledg our Baptiſm, to be a true Baptiſme: we deny theirs to be ſo. How ſacred and holy muſt that be, the holineſs whereof is acknowledged, even by ſacrilegious enemies?</hi> Is not this the very argument, and the ſame ground of plauſibleneſs? The Donatiſts denied the Baptiſme of Catholicks to be a true baptiſme; and did actully rebaptize them, that came to them from the Catholicks: the Catholicks did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Baptiſm of the Donatiſts to be true baptiſm; and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptize them that came from them: upon this, the Donatiſts ground their advantage, that their communion muſt be the ſafeſt way to heaven. Let any body tell me, where the difference is; or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, the advantage they make of our grant, is of no more force then was the grant of the Catholicks, which thoſe Schiſmaticks made ſuch boaſt of. If any ſhall except, that it is not the ſame caſe, becauſe, what is granted by us to the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> (a poſſibility of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in their Church:) and that which was then granted to the Donatiſts (the truth, or validity of their baptiſm, which they denied to the Catholicks) is not the ſame thing: I muſt anſwer, that it is a very frivolous exception. For though it be not altogether the ſame thing in expreſs termes: yet in ſubſtance of matter, they are reducible to one thing; in this queſtion eſpecially: and there is as much ground of advantage, or plauſibleneſs in the one, as there is in the other. The ground is the ſame; and the way of arguing the ſame. The queſtion between the Donatiſts, and Catholicks of that time, was, whether it were a ſufficient proof, that the Baptiſm of the Donatiſts was the trueſt of the two, and the <hi>ſafeſt way to heaven,</hi> becauſe theirs was acknowledged true by the Catholicks; not, the Catholicks true, by them. Now the anſwer to this, was; that the argument did not hold, becauſe there were other things in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Catholicks and Donatiſts, of great conſequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce to ſalvation, beſides <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> wherein if the Donatiſts were convicted, or ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:61006:59"/>
proved to be out of the way, their Baptiſm (except upon plea of ignorance:) could do them no good. The queſtion between the Romaniſts, and us, is about poſſibility of ſalvation, in either Church. We grant a poſſibility in theirs; they not in ours. Therefore theirs the <hi>ſafer way,</hi> by our grant? No: For as we grant a poſſibility in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; ſo we limit it, to ſuch and ſuch; and in ſuch a caſe onely: ſo that we make it a matter of great hazard, and peril, at the leaſt, not therefore the <hi>ſafeſt way,</hi> (certainly;) by our grant, and according to our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> would infer: nor, at all the ſafeſt way, (let them make the moſt of it:) except they can prove, that our limitations, and reſtrictions, are groundleſs; which is the main original buſineſs; to wit, which Church is orthodox; and which guilty of ſchiſm and hereſie.</p>
            <p>Now to this parallel of the Donatiſts, and Romaniſts in this buſineſs of ſalvation; which takes away much of the plauſibleneſs of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in their hands; and turnes the advantage on our ſide rather; (though they that are wiſe men, will not much rely upon ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing:) becauſe we may ſay, they imitate the Donatiſts (thoſe arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchiſmaticks:) therein: to this parallel, I ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 306.</note> the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> taking occaſion of ſome other uſe the Archbiſhop makes of the Donatiſts words, and arguments, doth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſomewhat, and will needs prove, that the orthodox Catholicks, for all that, (notwithſtanding that plea of the Donatiſts:) might not embrace the baptiſm of the Donatiſts, and their communion with it; (that is, in effect, forſake the Catholick Church:) without ſinning. This I think he might very well have omitted; there was no need at all of it. Yet to make ſomewhat of it, <hi>We ſuppoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Proteſtants grant, a man may live and die in the Roman Church; and that none of his errors ſhall hinder his ſalvation, whatſoever motives he may know to the contrary.</hi> Now upon ſtrange ſuppoſitions, ſtrange things may be built: but as the ſuppoſitions are but imaginary, ſo the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. What ground, I pray, could he have for ſuch a ſuppoſition, ſo contrary to all that is delivered by the Archbiſhop, in this buſineſs of ſalvation? himſelf doth afterwards acknowledg the impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his proceedings, (<hi>You will ſay perhaps &amp;c.</hi>) and hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to help himſelf, but by referring us to his firſt argument, (the impertinency, and invalidity whereof, I hope we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61006:60"/>
proved) as not to be anſwered or doubted of. But afterwards, when the Reverend Archbiſhop doth again inſiſt upon it, and quote their very words, our Author, or <hi>Labyrinth</hi> architect, doth endeavour a more direct anſwer, but cannot tell how, not here neither, except he may take it for granted, that the Proteſtants; <hi>at leaſt, the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 315</note> 
               <hi>moſt wiſe, and moſt conſiderable among them, do grant them poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of ſalvation, notwithſtanding any thing that we believe, or do:</hi> which, as he doth here deliver it, is moſt notoriouſly falſe. For this doth amount to an abſolute general grant: whereas, that which is granted, is but to <hi>ſome,</hi> and with <hi>danger,</hi> and <hi>peril.</hi> So that the parallel, ſtands firm, and in full force, to what it was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>And now we have done with their arguments, whereby they would prove their communion the <hi>ſafer way</hi>; becauſe many have been much taken with this kind of arguing; I will ſee how we can requite them, with ſomewhat of that nature. But I will be but ſhort; rather hint, then argue.</p>
            <p>That which is leaſt doubted of, may (plauſibly) be thought the ſafeſt. All that Proteſtants do poſitively believe as neceſſary to ſalvation, is granted and believed by the Romaniſts. But the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts do believe many things as neceſſary to ſalvation, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do believe to be falſe, and inconſiſtent (of themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out divers ſuppoſitions) with ſalvation: Therefore &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again: Without baptiſm, (ordinarily) there is no ſalvation. Want of the Sacrament alſo of the body and blood of Chriſt (in them that are capable:) is a great want, to ſay no more. But by the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning the <hi>intention of the Prieſt,</hi> no Romaniſt can be ſure, that he is baptized; or ever received the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Therefore &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again: Proteſtants do wholly rely for ſalvation, upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt, and mercy of God: The Romaniſts (Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> &amp;c.) adſcribe much to the merits of good works: But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> their great Champion, doth confeſs, that it is ſafeſt to truſt wholly to Gods mercy: if therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> be in the right, the Proteſtants, (at leaſt in this one point of higheſt conſequenee:) is the ſafeſt way.</p>
            <p>Again; charity is the chiefeſt of Chriſtian vertues, without which

no man can be ſaved. But there is more charity, apparently, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they that worſhip Chriſt as a Saviour; believe of him and other myſteries of faith, what is written in the Goſpels, or in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Creeds; and apply themſelves in ſincerity of heart, according to their powers, to keep his holy commandements, &amp;c. may through his merits, be ſaved: then to deny (no article of Faith obliging:) a poſſibility of ſalvation to ſuch; which, probably, may proceed from want of charity. Therefore &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again: By the Roman faith, when a man hath done all that he can, yet ſtill he is left uncertain, whether he ſhall be ſaved, or no: but by the Doctrine of moſt Proteſtants (though I will not juſtifie all that hath been written by ſome Proteſtants, in this point:) a man that liveth in the true faith, and ſerveth God, with an upright heart, to his power; may be ſure of his ſalvation. Therefore &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Divers other things of the ſame nature may be found, which may plauſibly be alledged, and with as much truth; as, that ordinary plea, ſo much inſiſted upon, that the Roman communion muſt be <hi>the ſafer way,</hi> becauſe a poſſibility of ſalvation is granted in it, by Proteſtants: which poſſibility, rightly underſtood, with all its limitations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions; doth in very deed evince the contrary; that it is not the <hi>ſafer way.</hi> I have been in a <hi>Labyrinth</hi>; yet I hope, not erred much from the main purpoſe. But I am now got out.</p>
            <p>What I had to ſay concerning <hi>infallibility,</hi> is now at an end. If it doth appear clearly, by what hath been ſaid, that it is not, neither directly, nor indirectly, by any neceſſary conſequence, grounded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reaſon, or Scripture, or conſent of antiquity: but rather the contrary: which nevertheleſs is propoſed unto us by our adverſaries (and that too, ſufficiently cleared:) as a main fundamental article of religion: then, upon this, we may ground certainly, that they that have erred in this main point, of all other, moſt inconſiſtent with <hi>reformation</hi> of Doctrine; might erre as well in divers other points, of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is it my intention, to give a particular account of at this time: the point of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> (as already ſaid) if ſo groſly miſtaken, and rigidly obt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uded, as we pretend to have clearly proved, is enough (that done) to ſhew the <hi>neceſſity of a reformation,</hi> as our
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61006:61"/>
title doth promiſe. Neither did we intend any more, at the firſt. Yet ſince it is ſo fallen out that two particulars; the forbidding of marriage to men in orders; and mutilation of the ſacrament; though I had no deſign to inſiſt upon thoſe particularly, more then any others; yet ſince it is ſo fallen out, occaſion offering it ſelf, that ſo much hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been ſaid of them; for the better ſatisfaction of the Reader; I ſhall be willing to make up here, before I proceed to other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what may be wanting to either; and that is, to the firſt, the forbidding of Marriage; of which ſomewhat was ſaid at the beginning. Of this later, the <hi>mutilation</hi> of the Sacrament, though there will be occaſion again, before we have done, and much more might be added to that; yet I am clear of opinion, that they that will not acknowledg by what hath been ſaid, that the forbidding of the Cup, in the judgment of Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> is <hi>à ſacrilegious</hi> mangling and abuſing of that Sacrament; if an Angel from heaven; or the preſent Pope now ſitting, ſhould averre it to their faces, and upbraid them for their obſtinacy; they would ſtudy ſome eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, the marriage of Prieſts, and Clergy men; becauſe I did not think fit, to ſtay the Reader ſo long, upon a ſubject that came in by the by, onely, and as it were, accidentally, in that place: I ſhall here adde ſomwhat, though but very little, in compariſon of what the ſubject will bear; Yet more I am confident, then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> or any other, that will deal plainly (let them try it, when they will) ſhall ever anſwer. I will not fetch the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs ſo high, as from the Scriptures, what was the Doctrine, or practice of the Apoſtles, ſo far as may be gathered by their writings: I ſhall content my ſelf, with what is granted by Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> and others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reſp. an R.P.</hi> 711.712.</note> that in the time of the Apoſtles, Biſhops might be married, or married men might be Biſhops (ſo they did not marry after they were Biſhops:) and uſe their wives freely. Whether this continued in the Primitive times and divers ages after; or no; ſhall be my inquiry. Secondly; whether the forbidding of marriage to Clergy men, hath not been the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of far greater evils, (ſo judged of by antiquity) which have been wickedly and irreligiouſly countenanced; or at leaſt, tolerated, by the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61006:61"/>To our purpoſe then: there is no body, but hath heard of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Nice,</hi> the firſt General Councel, and that of moſt authority with all men: what was done there, or rather forborn to be done (for it was then propoſed, and followed by ſome, that it might be made a law, that no married men ſhould be admitted to holy orders:) upon the advice, and grave remonſtrance of <hi>Paphnutius</hi>; (a man of great fame, for his holineſs of life, and ſufferings for the faith; who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was never married:) ancient Hiſtorians are very particular, in the relation of it, and all agree in their relation: and the relation is entred into the body of the Canon law, with many other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar records, and atteſtations of the ſame nature: ſo little doubt was then made of the truth of the ſtory. But this was ſuch a dead blow to the cauſe, which muſt be maintained, what ſhift ſoever is made: that <hi>Turrianus,</hi> firſt, as I take it; then after him, <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>; and others ſince, have made bold to queſtion it, and to deny it to be a true ſtory. Let no man wonder at it. There were a ſort of men anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, whoſe profeſſion was, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (in their own words:) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and on the contrary: that is, in the Poets expreſſion, <hi>Qui facere aſſuevit, Patriae non degener artis, Candida de nigris, &amp; de candentibus atra:) to make white to appear black; and black, to appear white.</hi> It was objected to <hi>Socrates</hi> the Philoſopher, by his enemies; but moſt wrongfully: It is moſt true of thoſe men, then, and ſince that, called <hi>Sophiſts,</hi> who made it their ſtudy (and it is almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, to what perfection many attained) to diſcourſe of any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſuddainly; to maintain any cauſe; good, or bad; true, or falſe; it was indifferent to them: they would undertake, if you would have them, to commend <hi>Therſites</hi> for the moſt accompliſhed man, even for thoſe things, that <hi>Homer</hi> made him infamous, that ever was: that ſnow, was black; and fire, cold: and ſuch things have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by latter wits too; but, I doubt, meanly performed, in compariſon. <hi>Julian</hi> his commendation of <hi>baldneſs,</hi> though full of excellent learning otherwiſe, hath much of that ſtrain. Let us not therefore make a wonder of it, if <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who were ſworn to the cauſe, and made it their ſtudy a long time; have ventured upon things of the ſame nature. But truth, is truth for all that: and <hi>Sophiſtry</hi> (to ſay no more) is <hi>ſophiſtry.</hi> And they that will take pains (with ſome help, if they want it;) may be ſatisfied,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61006:62"/>
and plainly diſcern the falſe play and juggling, that is uſed in the buſineſs, by thoſe great Champions of the Pope. He that will be fully ſatisfied (in this particular we are upon:) let him read <hi>Geor. Calixti, De conjugio ſacerdotum, tractatum.</hi> He ſhall find there all their arguments (if they deſerve the name) with candor, and ingenuity, as well as diligence, particularly ſifted, and ſolidly anſwered. He was (he will find him, if I be not much miſtaken) a learned, judicious, moderate man, as any that of late, hath meddled with controverſies: That is my judgment of him. I ſhall not therefore need to ſay much of this buſineſs: that which I chiefly intend, I do not find in him. But yet ſomwhat (though it may be found elſewhere) for their ſakes, that have not all books, at command; or perchance not the leiſure, to make uſe of them they have.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>relation</hi> then, we have ſpoken of, may be blaſted and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, if poſſible; <hi>Socrates</hi> the Hiſtorian (who they ſay, is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal avoucher of it:) his credit is called in queſtion. Divers things are laid to his charge, wherein it is pretended, he is willfully falſe, or ignorantly miſtaken. This indeed, is the way to perſwade men, there is no truth in the World. For if this be enough, becauſe ſome things may be objected, to queſtion all; whom ſhall we believe? And ſuppoſe he were the firſt; they were not babies, nor fools (ſo many after him:) that truſted him: but men whom we truſt (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and Papiſts) in very great matters. But ſee the blindneſs of prejudice, and partiality. In other things, that are not contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, but eſpecially, where ſome advantage (plauſibly) may be made of his words; I know no Author more frequently alledged: and then his authority is good, and current. I know there be other objections too, againſt the <hi>relation</hi> in <hi>Socrates</hi>: but they are all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: I ſhall not here take notice of them: What need we, though they were not? <hi>Gelaſius Cyzicenus</hi> of whom <hi>Perron</hi> in a place, where he doth make ſome uſe of his authority, for the Pope, doth obſerve, that he lived (when the Cardinal wrote) above eleven hundred years ago, and the very next age after the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi>: this man hath written an <hi>abſtract</hi> of the acts of the ſaid Councel: I know not of any exception, againſt his fidelity: we are beholding to the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican Library,</hi> for the Copy; printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Paris:</hi> this man hath the very ſame <hi>relation</hi>; with little alteration of words:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61006:62"/>
which is a clear argument, that <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> (who wrote at the ſame time almoſt) had it, whence he had it: and he profeſſeth, he had collected his <hi>abſtract,</hi> from the very <hi>Acts,</hi> then extant: and what can be more certain? Or muſt we prove, that the ſun is up in our hemiſphere, at noon day?</p>
            <p>I ſaid, they deliver it, <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> who lived together: and <hi>Gelaſius Cyzicenus</hi>; the next age after: (not to mention <hi>Caſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> who lived about the ſame time, or a little after: nor <hi>Suidas</hi> whoſe age is not certainly known: nor <hi>Niceph. Calliſtus,</hi> who lived not much above 300 years ago:) with little, or no alteration of words. Yet the diligent Reader may obſerve: that ſome things are expreſſed more fully, and clearly, by <hi>Gelaſius</hi> and others, then by <hi>Socrates:</hi> as that particularly, he ſhould ſay, he feared, that by that law, chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be violated, (for that he accounted, the lawful company of man and wife, Chaſtity:) ſo <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi>; but <hi>Gelaſius</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> &amp;c. <hi>good and commendable chaſtity: not onely by men only, but by women alſo, if they ſhould be bereaved of their husbands.</hi> Which (if nothing elſe) doth make it improbable, that they had it from <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi> But we have <hi>Gabriel Vazquez,</hi> for learning and judgment, not inferiour to the beſt of that ſide; who doth not onely acknowledg the truth and ſincerity of the <hi>relation,</hi> queſtioned by <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi>: yea, and <hi>Perron,</hi> three Cardinals; but doth very freely and ingenuouſly aſſert it, and vindicate it, anſwering the objections (or rather cavils:) made againſt it, by others: for which he is deſervedly commended, by him, whom I commended but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Georgius Calixtus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the buſineſs in agitation at the Councel, was plainly this, Not whether married men, in general, ſhould be allowed to be Prieſts or Biſhops: (for then we had been told, that ſuch were allowed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition they would forbear their wives, from that time; and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was in the Latin Church afterwards:) but, Whether they that had wives, ſhould be allowed to live with them, <hi>to lye with them,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>:) and the Councel of <hi>Gangres</hi> (a Councel of great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and authority:) doth pronounce <hi>Anathema,</hi> to them, that refuſed to receive the Communion at the hands of ſuch: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>conjugati</hi>: is their words. But here again our Sophiſters play their parts. They tell us, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is a <hi>praeterit,</hi> not a <hi>preſent</hi>: which
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61006:63"/>
therefore muſt be tranſlated, <hi>qui uxores habuit</hi>; not, <hi>habet: he that had wives</hi>; not; <hi>he that now hath.</hi> Could we preſume that all, that may read this, have ſome knowledg of the Greek; it would be very needleſs, if not ridiculous, to make any anſwer. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the contrary is more probable; it is well, that this very word is in the New Teſtament, and there tranſlated (as of neceſſity it muſt:) by the preſent, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>iis autem qui matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio juncti ſunt, praecipio:</hi> So the vulgar: which is ſacred with them: yet I doubt, whether that would ſerve the turn; did not that which follows of neceſſity require a preſent: <hi>And unto the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried (<gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>yet not I, but the Lord: Let not the wife depart from her husband.</hi> But beſides, if there were any ambiguity in the word; yet the matter of the Canon doth require a preſent tenſe, or ſignification. For the Canon was made againſt men of that age, who generally would not allow husband and wife to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and avoided the company of ſuch; but not of thoſe who had been married and continued widdowers. Beſides, <hi>Socrates</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the matter by the preſent <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. and <hi>Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> upon the place <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. As for the Latin tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations, ſome follow the preſent tenſe; and ſo it is entred into the body of the Canon Law, by <hi>Gratian:</hi> ſome render them by the <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit,</hi> through ignorance, or of purpoſe, to fit it to the Roman cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat: though even in the Latin ſome <hi>praeterits</hi> include the preſent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: as they that tranſlate <hi>uxorem duxit</hi>: which is as proper of them whoſe wives are alive, as of them whoſe wives are dead.</p>
            <p>After theſe, (to paſs-by many things between) let us ſee, Whether they come off better with the Canons of the Councel of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in <hi>Trullo</hi>: which was an <hi>Apendix</hi> or ſecond part, of the ſixth Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumenical Councel. The Graecians called it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Balſamon</hi> gives the reaſon. It hath always been of as great authority with them, as any other (for ſo they maintain it) General Councel: and many Canons of it, are received into the body of the Canon Law, by <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</hi> And certain it is, though generally it was not received by the Roman Church; that Pope <hi>Hadrianus,</hi> the firſt of that name, did high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approve of it; or egregiouſly diſſemble with <hi>Theraſius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> (and indeed <hi>Baronius</hi> ſaith little leſs, if you will believe him) in a letter to him, where he ſpeaks very honourably of ſome
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61006:63"/>
Canons of it. Beſides that, the ſeventh Oecumenical Councel, (in ſo great eſteem, with all worſhippers of images) did allow it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, both <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> do what they can to undermine the authority of it. Now by thoſe Canons, Biſhops indeed were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred from their wives, if they had any; Prieſts, Deacons, Sub-Deacons, were allowed to marry? if they pleaſed, before ordination; and after ordination, if then married, they are ſo far from being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred from their wives, that if upon pretence of piety, they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to live with them, or would put them away, they were ſuſpended from their charge for a time; and if they perſiſted, to be depoſed. So were thoſe (Biſhops or Patriarchs) who ſhould attempt (<hi>conjunctione cum legitima uxore, &amp; conſuetudine privare,</hi> as the words are tranſlated in the <hi>Paris</hi> edition of <hi>Balſamon</hi>) to bereave them (Prieſts, or Deacons) of the ſociety, or company of their lawfull wives; they alſo to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. By the ſame Canon the Roman Church is noted, as having a contrary order, not agreeable to Apoſtolical conſtitutions. And this very Canon, is in the body of the Canon Law: <hi>Diſt.</hi> 31. <hi>Cap.</hi> 13. But, however the Councel had ſo ordered it, as we have ſaid: yet it was not conſtantly obſerved. For in the days of <hi>Leo,</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, (ſo ſurnamed:) Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who reigned ſome two hundred years after; Prieſts, and Deacons uſually, as doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by a <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the ſaid Emperor againſt it, had two years liberty after ordination, to conſider, whether they would marry or no.</p>
            <p>That which I have more to ſay of this buſineſs in general, is: <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus</hi> doth cite divers Authors, who wrote before the Reformation, but of no ſmall credit to this day among the Romaniſts; and among others, <hi>Thom. Aquinas</hi>; who all agree, that this Prohibition of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to men in holy Orders, is meerly <hi>juris poſitivi,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi> which therefore may be aboliſhed, or repealed, by the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by which it was enacted. But even ſince the Reformation he doth name ſome, who have made bold to maintain the ſame. To thoſe I adde, <hi>Tho. Compegius Bononienſis Epiſcopus Feltrenſis,</hi> who hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a book <hi>De caelibatu ſacerdotum non abrogando:</hi> and very earneſt he is for it, that it ought not. Yet even he, doth confeſs, that for the firſt four hundred years, there was no ſuch law, that obliged any in ſacred orders: that <hi>Syricius,</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> (which hath been the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61006:64"/>
conſtant and common opinion, before this late breach:) was the firſt Author of it, and that it may be repealed. Beſides, he quotes <hi>Abbas Siculus (inſignem Canonum interpretem,</hi> as he ſtiles him: <hi>Panormitanus,</hi> he means;) whoſe judgment is: <hi>That it were very expedient for the ſaving of ſouls, that they that would contain and merit</hi> (by works of ſupererogation, he means:) <hi>might be left to their liberty: but they that would not, might marry: ſince that experience hath made it apparent, that the contrary of what was intended by the law of Continence, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; for that they do not live ſpiritually, or purely; but, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of their ſouls, are contaminated</hi> (or, <hi>defiled) with unlawful copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; whereas they might live chaſtly with a wife,</hi> Beſides, he doth put a caſe in law, how it may fall out, according to the rules and Maximes of the Canon Law, and definitions of Popes upon it; that a Prieſt may be married, and compelled to live with his wife.</p>
            <p>Now I ask; if the marriage of Prieſts and others of the Clergy be not unlawful, in it ſelf; which is generally granted: and the prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of it be the occaſion of ſo much ſcandal and wickedneſs, as even among heathens would be abominable: and this too, certain and acknowledged; witneſs the account we had before, from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus Damianus</hi>; the complaints of ſo many others; Zealous Papiſts, otherwiſe; in all ages: for this ſeven or eight hundred years, at leaſt; beſides daily experience: is not this prohibition, a ſin, a wickedneſs not to be excuſed, but by them that care not what becomes of the world, and all religion; ſo they have their wills and ends? But what if Popes, even by their laws and definitions, make that, which in its own nature, and by the law of God, is horrid and abominable; leſſe criminous, and more tolerable, then that which by the law of God is acknowledged lawful? Yea, we might ſay, <hi>honourable?</hi> Is not fornication in its own nature, and in any man, a great and ſcandalous ſin; and if notorious, and without bounds, able, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to draw the curſe of God, and his ſevereſt judgments, upon any nation? How much then more horrid and intolerable, and of more dangerous conſequence in Clergy-men, whoſe function is holy; whoſe perſons are in ſome degree ſacred; and their lives to be a rule and example unto others? What is horrible, and abominable, if this be not?</p>
            <p>By the Canon of the <hi>Concilium Neocaſarienſe,</hi> a Prieſt, if he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61006:64"/>
(after Ordination) he is to be depoſed. Well, be it ſo. It is enough for us to know, that in the time of the Apoſtles, there was no ſuch Law: and that Popes have diſpenſed, even with Biſhops, that were married, and had children: whereof we have a notable example: <hi>Diſt.</hi> 28. <hi>c.</hi> 13. <hi>De Syracuſana:</hi> by the tenor of which Diſpenſation, it doth not appear,<note place="margin">

               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61006:65"/>That was the Religion of thoſe dayes: how is it now? How the Church of <hi>Rome diſpenſed,</hi> or <hi>connived</hi> in moſt ſcandalous times; (and where ſuch <hi>diſpenſation</hi> or <hi>connivance</hi> is, how can it be expected other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, at any time?) we heard before from <hi>Petrus Damianus,</hi> the Popes Agent. A further account we might have had of the ſtate of thoſe times from the ſaid <hi>Damianus,</hi> had it not been ſuppreſſed by the Pope, as we read at large in <hi>Baronius</hi>: and yet by that account which is in <hi>Baronius,</hi> I do not know it could be much worſe in <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi> Now let us hear another caſe from authentick Records; and then tell me in good earneſt, what account the Pope makes of <hi>Fornication,</hi> and by conſequent of the Scriptures; and what we may think of them, that maintain ſuch Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> Legat to the Pope in thoſe places; asks counſel of <hi>Innocentius</hi> the Third, what courſe he ſhould take with thoſe Prieſts, that had more <hi>concubines</hi> then one. A queſtion of hard reſolution in thoſe times it ſeems; we may gueſs what times they were. But that the Archbiſhop ſtruck at, was this: Who they were, that were anciently called <hi>digami,</hi> or <hi>bigami</hi>; is not certain, or generally yet agreed upon, among the Learned. There be three Interpretations of the word, (nay, no leſs then ſeven, reckoned by the Civil Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers:) but two opinions onely that are much queſtioned: whether they, that had married two, or more Wives ſucceſſively; or, they, that had divorced from one, and married another. Both opinions have very learned abettors; and it is not eaſie, abſolutely to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which is the trueſt. Hard indeed it is to believe, that they ſhould be made incapable of holy Orders by the ancient Church, who had married two Wives lawfully, one after another: or to believe, that that was S. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. But it will not much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to know, as to our preſent occaſion. Whoever they were, that were intended; it is certain they were declared <hi>irregular,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of ordination. Now, the Archbiſhop, it ſeems, had ſome thoughts, that Prieſts (or <hi>Biſhops</hi> perchance: but they muſt not be named: yet <hi>Pet. Damianus,</hi> in his Letter to the Pope, upon the like occaſion, made no ſcruple to name them: neither is the unworthineſs of men, any juſt exception againſt the holineſs of any place, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence that is due unto it; whereof we have many examples in the Scriptures:) who kept divers Concubines at one time, might be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61006:65"/>
brought within the compaſs of <hi>irregularity,</hi> under the notion and title of the <hi>Bigami.</hi> This he propoſeth to the Pope; without whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it was in vain to think he could bring any ſuch thing to paſs: witneſs <hi>Petrus Damianus,</hi> and what oppoſition he found, when he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, though authorized by the Pope, to apply ſome remedy to the exorbitancie of thoſe times. But the Pope was not of that mind. His reſolution of the caſe, therefore, is, that he ſhall proceed with ſuch, as guilty onely of <hi>ſimple Fornication.</hi> Now they that know, what a petty buſineſs, this matter of <hi>ſimple Fornication,</hi> is made by divers Canoniſts; will eaſily believe, that no great puniſhment was intended to thoſe notorious whoremaſters, or fornicators.

            <p>There is an account, or <hi>report</hi> ſomewhere extant, of the ſtate of Monaſteries in <hi>England,</hi> in the year of the Lord 1538. delivered by the Viſitors, under this title: <hi>Breviarium compertorium in Monaſteriis,</hi> &amp;c. a ſhort abſtract whereof hath been ſet out in <hi>Latin,</hi> which I have.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61006:66"/>
I have looked upon it often, with great indignation (ſuch a Prior, by name; or, ſuch a Friar; one, or two Concubines: ſome, eight, nine, ten, twelve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or thirteen; and beſides, a <hi>Sodomite,</hi> &amp;c.) as ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that matters might be made worſe then they were found, to pleaſe the King; or out of ſpight to the profeſſion: and I would much rather think ſo ſtill. But I muſt needs ſay, ſince I read <hi>Petrus Damiani</hi> (ſo irrefragable a witneſs) and compared him with the report of others, who themſelves were of the ſame profeſſion: but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, what a light account was made of ſuch abominations, by thoſe that ſhould have withſtood them by their authority: and laſtly, how averſe they were (thoſe in power, and moſt account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) from the onely true effectual remedy; my charity is much put to it; I cannot tell what to think. And theſe are the fruits of Pope <hi>Syricius</hi> (according to the common opinion) his <hi>Definition:</hi> record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Decr. diſt.</hi> 83. which, whoſoever reads, if he be not a ſtranger to the Scriptures, may juſtly ſuſpect, it was made in oppoſition to the Scriptures, and S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, particularly: as ſpeaking of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, with all manner of ſcorn, and contempt; whereas the Authors of thoſe Canons, of the Sixth General Councel, by which they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid a Biſhop to live with his Wife, they uſe much tenderneſs, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all ſuſpicion, as though they did it in contempt of <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (whether holy Scriptures, or thoſe <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> that were then called <hi>Apoſtolicae Conſtitutiones</hi>; as <hi>Balſamon</hi> doth interpret them:) whereas it was done by them (ſo they profeſs) upon a ſuppoſition, that men of that eminency might do more good in the reputation of a <hi>continent</hi> life; diſengaged from the luſts and cares of the world; and leſs ſubject to ſlanders and reproaches, which Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren do often occaſion; then yoked and charged with Wife and Children.</p>
            <p>Now after all this, whether we may not conclude, that ſince the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would not; it was lawful for others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves in this one point (had there been but this one:) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the marriage of Clergy-men; let the Reader judge: for that is it, which we did propoſe to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Having now gone over three particulars; that, of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as the chiefeſt, and which alone might have done the buſineſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, chiefly intended, and proſecuted; but beſides that, two others,

               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> whoſe piety, prudence, magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity (to which ſome add zeal and conſtancy for the Catholick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: meaning that, which he was born, and brought up in:) is acknowledged by Hiſtorians of both ſides: after the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> was ended, and he ſaw that little, or nothing was done by it to ſatisfie the expectation of ſo many in all Countreys in point of <hi>reformation,</hi> and to reconcile differences; but rather to the contrary; ſenſible alſo, how he had been from time to time dallyed with, by vain promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; being much troubled at it; and at the ſad conſequences of it: he begun, not without the advice of his moſt faithful, and wiſeſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors; to caſt about, and finally did reſolve, upon another way, how he might come to the knowledg of the truth, in all thoſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed points. The way was to find out a man, (if the Chriſtian world afforded ſuch a one) one of their own communion, a profeſſed and acknowledged Roman Catholick, but of approved integrity and piety, and for his parts and abilities, in this kind of learning, eſpecially (the knowledge of antiquity, and all controverſies of Religion:) not inferiour, if poſſible unto any, in any part of the world. Upon inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a man was found. What ſhall I ſay? Let any man in his private thoughts, form to himſelf the <hi>idea</hi> of a man, ſuch a one as he could have wiſhed, or his fancy can repreſent unto him; I dare almoſt ſay, that this man went beyond it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So many particulars did concur, to compleat him for ſuch a work; that if I ſay leſs then a <hi>miracle,</hi> I think I ſay too little (all things well conſidered:) and he that doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg a <hi>providence</hi> in it, I know not how to ſay leſs, but that he is, or hath much of an Infidel in him. For his integrity, and the exemplarineſs of his converſation, all the country, where he lived, would have born him witneſs; it was ſo publickly, and notoriouſly known unto all; but moſt admired of them, that knew him beſt. His learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowledg of antiquity, inſight in controverſies, had made him famous: but affection and reverence, to ancient rites and ceremonies that did ſavour of true Primitive Piety, he had given ſuch proofs, and teſtimonies of, both by his practice, and by his writings, his <hi>Liturgica,</hi> his <hi>Hymni Eccleſiaſtici, preces Eccleſiaſticae</hi>; (all extant) as greater could not be expected from any man. Yet in thoſe things, I will ſuppoſe that ſome (not many, truly:) might equal him: which is as much as I can ſay. But then, let us conſider the reſt, and let any man tell me, whether he
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61006:67"/>
thinks, I have exceeded in my expreſſions. Firſt, he was at that time, when the Emperor did addreſs himſelf to him by his Letters, and to ſome Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> about it, (the Emperors Letters, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, are extant, and to be ſeen:) a bed-rid man, brought ſo low with the Gout, and what other infirmities; that <hi>affidavit</hi> was made unto the Emperor, ſhould he attempt to go to him, as was deſired, he would in all probability die by the way, and not hold out. Indeed, he did not live many years after, though he did out-live <hi>Ferdinand</hi>; and gave his account to <hi>Maximilian,</hi> who ſucceeded, and proſecuted the buſineſs with as much eagerneſs, as <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had done. Here firſt we may (who can do leſs?) obſerve the Providence of God; that whereas <hi>Caſſander</hi> (for that was his name:) was firſt appointed to come, and give an account unto the Emperor, by word of mouth: he was afterwards appointed to do it in writing, that ſo all poſterity might reap the benefit of it. Then ſecondly; whereas it might be ſaid, (there was no great probability, if he were ſuch a pious honeſt man; but what will not men ſay, when they are put to it?) that he might have ſome worldly ends, to gratifie others, or to advance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as we know, that ſuch and ſuch were made Cardinals, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Popes cauſe, with all their might, and power: How can that be ſuſpected of one in <hi>Caſſanders</hi> condition, which daily put him in mind of another world and made him utterly incapable of enjoying any thing, that this world could afford, as a temptation? But that which, as I take it, conſidering how much he had to ſay for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and their cauſe, and againſt his own party; is moſt obſervable; is; that this very man, had been very unkindly uſed, by ſome chiefeſt Proteſtants, who ſuſpecting him, by ſome writings of his, (they knew nothing of his perſon:) to have been a certain ſcandalous Proteſtant, inclining to Popery, and ready to leave them; fell upon him foully, with all bitterneſs and virulency; to their own ſhame, and the no leſs grief and ſcandal of many others. Was not this ſomewhat to try a man, whether he would be provoked, or no; and ſuffer his judgment (as moſt men) to be corrupted by his Intereſt? But <hi>Caſſander</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf paſſion proof. He did anſwer them, who ſo bitterly had provoked him, with all meekneſs and moderation: and as for the Proteſtants, and their cauſe in general, it did appear to all the world in general, that what he had written before of them, he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61006:68"/>
not to gratifie any, great, or ſmall; but to ſatisfie his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>But yet for all this: ſome will be ready to ſay (I know:) they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue not what <hi>Caſſander</hi> ſaith, becauſe they account him not a ſound Catholick.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Labyr. p.</hi> 144.296.</note> So indeed the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> doth except againſt him, as many others have done before him. But why not a ſound Catholick? Could they charge him with any particular opinion which anciently hath been accounted He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical; they would ſay ſomewhat. Or could they ſay, though never ſo pious, or learned; yet he was a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> he did favour his own party, (as moſt men are too apt:) that were ſomewhat too. But a man, againſt whoſe learning and integrity there can be no exception: who lived, and died in the Communion of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; round about in the Countrey where he lived, in high credit, and eſteem: bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried honourably by <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, in one of their Churches; with an <hi>Inſcription,</hi> or monument, now extant, and to be ſeen by all that go to thoſe parts; which monument doth contain an ample teſtimony of his integrity, piety, learning; his fame and reputation, whileſt he lived, with all men, farr, and near; and yet he not a ſound Catholick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath freely reproved or charged the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny groſs errors, and abuſes, in matters of Faith, and otherwiſe: is not this wiſe arguing? For apparently, either it ſignifies nothing: or it doth ground upon this, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church cannot erre: he is therefore an Heretick, who doth charge it with errors, or maintain opinions, contrary to what it teacheth. But is not this a meer <hi>petitio principii</hi>: a moſt ſenſeleſs and ridiculous kind of arguing? If therefore it doth not follow, that he muſt be an Heretick, becauſe he excepted againſt the errors of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: how much more probable, becauſe he was a judicious able man, as any thoſe times afforded; a pious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious man, ſo acknowledged by all men: a man bred and born in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: (and certainly, accuſtomance and education hath ſome influence upon the wiſeſt of men:) who lived and died in the communion of it: in all likelihood, therefore, well-affected, and more likely to extenuate, then to aggravate: upon theſe grounds, I ſay, how much more likely, that he had good reaſon for what he doth except againſt; and that his judgment and authority, ſhould be of great weight with all ſober judicious <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks? For as for the Proteſtants,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61006:68"/>
though truly his great learning, approved piety, and integrity muſt make his judgment in all things very conſiderable, even to them; yet the ſame obligation doth not lie upon them: they may ſay, as was intimated before; long accuſtomance, education, affection, might make him, as a man, unſenſibly partial; or at leaſt, leſs ſenſible, (in ſome things) then otherwiſe he might have been. For the further ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Reader, but of all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, eſpecially; I ſhall add, that his Works were not onely printed by <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, when he firſt ſet them out ſingly; but long after his death, all reprinted in <hi>Paris,</hi> in one Volume, by <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks: in a fair Character (more then is uſual, for the largeneſs of it:) <hi>Pariſiis, apud Hieronymum Dro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Two Books there be of his, of this argument chiefly: <hi>De officio pii, publicae tranquillitatis verè amantis viri, in hoc religionis diſſidio.</hi> In that Book (to begin with that, becauſe firſt written:) after ſome reaſons given, why the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is ſtill a true Church: (<hi>Eccleſiae Catholicae non contemnendum membram:</hi> in his own expreſſion: that is: <hi>a member of the Catholick Church, not to be contemned:</hi> or if you will poſitively, becauſe the words will bear it: <hi>a conſiderable member of the Catholick Church:</hi>) and that there is no neceſsity of ſeparating, though corruption be acknowledged; he doth add: <hi>Interim tamen, eos damnare non poſſum,</hi> &amp;c. that is: <hi>But nevertheleſs I cannot condemn them, who perſiſting in the fundamentals of the Apoſtolick Doctrine, out of love of a pure</hi> (or ſincere) <hi>Religion, upon good information from them that are both pious and learned, that ſome-things ought to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; Supreme Authority leading, and the common conſent of the Church concurring, in ſome part of the Church (Catholick) have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſome things in the Doctrine, and aboliſhed ſome Ceremonies, though ancient, great utility, and even neceſſity compelling them for the good of the people: and in lieu of them, have eſtabliſhed others, better agreeing with piety and diſcipline: provided that this be done, with as little ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and diſturbance, as is poſſible: and that communion of ſpirit, and the bonds of peace, be ſtill preſerved with the reſt of the Body. For who can blame that member, which when the reſt of the body is ſick, and will not be cured; doth take care of it ſelf, that it may be cured? Not to inſult upon the reſt, but to give it an example, and to invite it to do the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61006:69"/>
like.</hi> (All this, how appliable to the Engliſh Reformation; let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge.) <hi>Theſe — though by ſome, who through an immoderate zeal, or particular diſeaſe of their mind, abhor all reſtoration, or reformation of the Church; they are traduced and condemned as hereticks, and ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and enemies of the Church: yet I know not how to ſeparate, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them either from Chriſt the Head</hi> (of the Church:) <hi>or from the body,</hi> (of Chriſt:) <hi>which is the Church.</hi>

               <note place="margin">1. <hi>p</hi> 789</note>This, he repeats again, not long after: <hi>Quare ut ante quoque dixi, qui recta ſententia de Chriſto, &amp;c.</hi> where indeed, he doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that he knows not how to acquit them of <hi>ſchiſm</hi> who rejoice in this <hi>ſeparation</hi>; will not acknowledg them from whom they have ſeparated a true Church; have no love, no charity, for them: but abhor all manner of Communion with them, as very limbs of Satan, or Antichriſt. Of which kind of men, we ſhall have occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider afterwards; and how right his judgment may be in this. What will our Zelots of the Roman party ſay to this? The furious abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of thoſe mad Tenets, That he that doth not in all things, believe as the Roman Church doth believe; is an Infidel and (ordinarily) damned? What will they ſay? Why then this good man, whoſe memory is ſo precious with many Roman Catholicks, he muſt be damned too. For though he lived and died in the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; yet you ſee, what he maintained; ſo contrary to that, which is maintained by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>: at leaſt, if it muſt be ſo, that Jeſuites and Jeſuited Zealots, muſt be accounted the beſt, and trueſt members of that Church; which I doubt many will not grant. But what ſhew ſoever, ſuch men make before others; yet I believe there be but few of the number, who (if really they believe a heaven and hell:) in their private thoughts, will not rather, (when dead) wiſh their ſouls, where this mans is; then where they can hope, that ſuch furious courſes, and Tenets, will bring them.</p>

may be, at ſome other time, when they have better conſidered of it, how much it doth concern them; we ſhall be told of ſomewhat elſe: ſome reaſons perchance, why one ſhould believe it: or ſome pretended evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, to prove it. For we know, they are good at it; we have had ſome experience; when they think the cauſe doth need it. But this I hope we ſhall ſufficiently prevent; there will be occaſion by and by: till then, the Reader may think of it, as he pleaſeth. In the mean time, God be thanked, that he hath provided ſcrupulous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, (as ſome may be) that comfort, that they may be out of all fear of <hi>ſchiſm</hi> in the judgment of this pious learned Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, ſo that they want no charity for them, who do not yet think themſelves bound to follow their example. And I hope that they that wiſhed ſo well to his works, as to cauſe them to be ſo fairly reprinted in <hi>Paris</hi>; may probably be thought to have been of the ſame opinion.</p>
            <p>Now after this general judgment of <hi>Caſſander,</hi> concerning Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants: we ſhall in the next place, produce his opinion concerning ſome particular points, which his <hi>Conſultatio</hi> muſt afford us. Yet himſelf doth acknowledg, that he did but in part, acquit himſelf of that charge; his infirmities giving him but little reſpit for ſuch thoughts; as he doth excuſe himſelf to the Emperour, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. But that he did paſs by many things, doth appear by theſe words, in the 26<hi>th</hi> Article, <hi>De poteſtate Eccleſiaſtica: Ad haec con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedimus,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>We do grant moreover, that they that have the government of the Church, muſt earneſtly be intreated, that by their care, thoſe known and manifeſt abuſes (ſome of which have been ſpoken of before) which have been the occaſion of theſe troubles, and commotions, wherewith the Church at this day is very dangerouſly toſſed, and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (thoſe that concern the Maſs, and other parts of Divine Service, eſpecially:) may be taken away and aboliſhed.</hi> Now this being written ſince the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> it doth plainly appear what he thought of that Councel, and their performances. And to this purpoſe, though where he treats <hi>De Pontifice Romano,</hi> he doth yield unto him ſome kind of Supremacy, by the grant, or conſent of the ancient Church: yet doth he immediately before, roundly charge him; to have been the chiefeſt cauſe of thoſe ſad calamities, and diſtractions in the Church; which did ſo grievouſly affect him; for that puffed

up with a vain conceit of his Eccleſiaſtical power, he did proudly and faſtidiouſly deſpiſe, and reject them, who rightfully and modeſtly, made their addreſſes, or remonſtrances: His words are: <hi>Non negarim tamen—praecipuam cauſſam hujus calamitatis &amp; diſtractionis Eccleſiae, illis aſſignandam, qui inani quodam faſtu Eccleſiaſticae poteſtatis inflati, rectè &amp; modestè admonentes ſuperbè &amp; faſtidiosè contempſerunt, &amp; repule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi>

have recalled ſome of his <hi>conceſſions</hi>; if occaſion had offered it ſelf: then to have repented (as the Author of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> doth charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hope:) before he died, that he had ſpoken ſo freely of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the errors, and corruptions of that Church.</p>
            <p>Of Prieſts being forbidden to marry, he ſaith among other things; <hi>Videmus hoc decreto,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We ſee, that by that decree,</hi> (or, <hi>ordinance) Chriſtian chaſtity and continence, is ſo far from being confirmed; that by it, a door to all manner of luſt and flagitiouſneſs, is rather opened</hi>: and again, to the ſame purpoſe; afterwards he quotes <hi>Panormitanus</hi> (that oracle of the Canon law, as once accounted:) whoſe words we had before out of <hi>Campegius</hi>: and ſuch an apprehenſion he had of the horror of it, and how much Chriſtianity did ſuffer by it; that it made him venture upon a ſtrange ſpeech, as it may ſeem to ſome; That though this <hi>caelibatus,</hi> or ordinance of Prieſts forbearance, were granted to be of Apoſtolick inſtitution (which he knew it is not:) there was reaſon enough why it ſhould be diſpenſed with. Neither would he have onely married Prieſts allowed, as anciently: but that it might be lawful for Prieſts, to marry after ordination alſo; which was not wont to be: and yet, good man, when he wrote thoſe things, ſuch was his condition, as to the world; that auſterity might have been feared, rather then too much indulgence, had not he ſeen a great neceſſity,</p>
            <p>In his Chapter, <hi>De miſſis ſolitarijs,</hi> he doth avouch <hi>Hofmeiſterus's</hi> ſaying, that it was manifeſt, that the faſhion both of the Greek, and Roman Church was, that not only the Prieſt, who did officiat (he ſaith <hi>ſacrifice</hi>:) but other Prieſts and Deacons alſo then preſent, and the reſt of the people, or part of it, at leaſt, did communicate: and that it is a wonder how it came to be left off; and that men ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to recall that good cuſtome into practice.</p>
            <p>But it is time to make an end: though I hope the Reader that doth apprehend the caſe rightly, will not think this labour ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. Sure it is, that the Emperour who ſet him on work, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good aſſurance of his abilities, in every reſpect, for ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; had ſuch an expectation of it, that he intended it for a <hi>rule</hi> to all Pariſhes within his Dominion: as doth appear by his letter to <hi>Caſſander</hi> himſelf, in the end of the Second Letter: <hi>Ita ut tale ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marium,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61006:71"/>
ſit quaſi methodus quaedam,</hi> &amp;c. They are very remarkable words: let the Reader well peruſe them, and he will ſay, had ſo much been written to the Pope, he would have had a very pregnant teſtimony for his <hi>Infallibility:</hi> but what reckoning in the mean time the Emperor made of the Popes <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or abſolute Supremacy over the Church, the Reader may gueſs, by thoſe words.</p>
            <p>I hope by this, thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, that ſhall happen to read this, if not ſworn to the cauſe in deſpight of all truth; will have a better opinion of <hi>Reformation,</hi> then they had before, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a worſe opinion of thoſe men, who bear them in hand, that all was well, when <hi>Luther</hi> began to ſtir. And though I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that they, who (adhering to that blind Maxime, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſpeaks againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though never ſo good a Catholick otherwiſe, and generally ſo accounted; cannot be <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, eo nomine,</hi> becauſe he ſpeaketh againſt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; which is a ridiculous <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> as before ſhewed:) are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by the judgment of ſuch a one as <hi>Caſſander</hi>; will be much moved by any other Authority, of the ſame nature: Yet becauſe we have better hopes of the ingenuity of many of that ſide; and that he may not be thought the onely man that hath ſo thought, or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: I will joyn another with him; who for the opinion men had generally of his worth and piety; in <hi>Spain,</hi> eſpecially, where his works have been among all Preachers, in marvellous eſteem, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any other mans; comes very near to <hi>Caſſander</hi>; even <hi>Joh. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> by name. Yet for all that, there wanted not a Zealot of that ſide, that durſt charge him publickly, with no leſs then ſeventy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Lutheran errors, and opinions; whereof, one is, as I take it, that <hi>we are juſtified by faith onely.</hi> But <hi>Ferus</hi> wanted not ſtout and able champions; more, it may be; but one, I am ſure; <hi>Michael Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina, Bellarenſis, Franciſcanus:</hi> who with great applauſe of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that ſide, vindicated him, and laid it home to his adverſary, as a malicious and ignorant Sycophant, or ſlanderer. The Book was firſt publiſhed at <hi>Complutum,</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>; (that part of <hi>Spain</hi> which is called <hi>Hiſpania Tarraconenſis:</hi>) famous for an Univerſity. There, firſt; and ſoon after, <hi>Moguntiae,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> A. D. 1572. Let any man read that <hi>Apologie</hi> (ſo it is ſtyled:) and he moſt of neceſſity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquit <hi>Ferus,</hi> nay, acknowledge him <hi>Virum Catholiciſſimum,</hi> as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61006:72"/>
there ſtyled; or charge all <hi>Spain</hi> as Lutherans; or favourers of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, at leaſt. Now all I intend by this naming of him, is but to tell my Reader, that this <hi>Johannes Ferus, vir catholiciſſimus</hi>; this eminent <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick; hath written of the depravation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, amongſt Papiſts; and of the neceſſity of a Reformation (our Subject:) as roundly, and freely, as almoſt any Proteſtant. For which I appeal to his <hi>Preface,</hi> to his Comments upon the <hi>Acts.</hi> And <hi>Ferus</hi> alſo, wrote ſince the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> which is to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>I think the ingenuous Reader, is ſufficiently convicted by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of two ſuch witneſſes, and that he will acknowledge it. Yet to ſtop the mouth of impudency it ſelf (if it be a thing poſſible:) or at leaſt, that all men that are not paſt all ſenſe, and have been made to believe, that there was no ſuch <hi>need,</hi> as we pretend; may by the light of ſo many evidences, be forced to acknowledge they have been groſsly abuſed; and if in this particular, apparently; then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, in divers others; I will yet produce the teſtimony of one more, a man of very different temper from <hi>Caſſander,</hi> or <hi>Ferus</hi>; yet truly, a learned man; but a rigid Romaniſt, as doth appear by a ſpeech he made in the name of <hi>Philip</hi> the II. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> uttered at the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi>; whereby he doth bitterly inveigh againſt the Proteſtants, as unworthy of all compliance or condeſcenſion: from which he doth earneſtly diſſwade the Councel. That ſpeech of his, is extant, with three Orations, uttered before <hi>Pius</hi> V. and ſome Sermons of his before the ſaid Councel of <hi>Trent</hi>: printed by <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Plantin,</hi> A.

In that Dedication, he doth inveigh againſt <hi>Luther</hi>'s proceedings, ſufficiently: yet ſo, that he doth acknowledg <hi>bona ex malis orta; &amp; ex ipſis morbis, medicàmenta</hi>; as he ſpeaketh.

I think here is plain acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, that there <hi>was not any corner of the world left, where both manners, and doctrine</hi> (among Chriſtians) <hi>had not ſuffered great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and detriment:</hi> and I think, the reſtoring of Gods Word to its credit, and authority, with the Writings of the ancient Fathers; (the acknowledged effects or conſequences of the then <hi>Reformation</hi> of Religion:) deſerve to be looked upon as a ſingular bleſsing, and happineſs of the times. True it is, he ſaith afterwards, that the evils which came along, were greater. But what he, as an Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, doth lay to our charge; we are not bound to acknowledge true, becauſe he ſaith it: but what he doth grant to us, not out of any good will, but being forced by the evidence of things; I think we may ſafely build upon, as unqueſtionable truth: and they that will
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61006:73"/>
not yield to ſuch evidence; what reaſon have they to expect, that they ſhould ever be believed in any thing? We do not deny, but many evils enſued upon thoſe alterations, (all alterations are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous:) to which <hi>Luther</hi> gave occaſion. But we know that the ſame thing was objected by heathens to the Goſpel of Chriſt: and what was anſwered by the godly Fathers of thoſe times, we know. We deny not alſo, but that diviſion, and ſeparation, is in it ſelf the greateſt of evils, that can happen in the Church: but whether <hi>Luther</hi> or the Pope, was the occaſion of the ſeparation that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, is a great queſtion: Or rather, no queſtion at all, with us Proteſtants, but that it happened through the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their wicked obſtinacy, who would not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to good counſel, nor yield to any real reformation which from all parts was ſo much deſired.</p>
            <p>We have heard <hi>Caſſander</hi> ſay as much, that the Pope was the cauſe. Though <hi>Caſſander,</hi> with all truly judicious and wiſe, may be inſtead of a thouſand, for a witneſs, in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:<note place="margin">

            <p>The ſame <hi>Fontindonius</hi> (a man more conſiderable to us, by far) in that very Oration to the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,<note place="margin">

he. And for that he faith of the <hi>Legati</hi> of ſeveral Countreys; they that have read a Book intituled <hi>Inſtructions &amp; Miſſives des Roys Tres-Chriſtiens de Fr.</hi> &amp;c. printed 1608. containing the ſeveral ſpeeches, and Orations made by the King of <hi>France,</hi> his ſeveral Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and others authorized by him; in the Councell of <hi>Trent:</hi> their account given to their King, and his Letters and replyes and other things of that nature; will ſay, that he had good reaſon for what he ſaid,</p>
            <p>For beſides many ſuch places, where they mention the <hi>wounds and ſores</hi> of the Church; they ſay in one place, after the peruſal of ſome papers of that ſubject; that their reformation was not like to prove like to <hi>Eſays healing plaiſters (Eſ.</hi> 38.) made of figgs; ſuch as the Church wanted, and deſired: but to <hi>Ezekiels</hi> (ch. 10.) his <hi>untempered morter,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>In another place they tell the Councel, that they came to the Pope, craving of him that Spiritual bread, which ſhould be the food of their ſouls: whereof all the Chriſtian world over, there was ſuch ſcarcity, as was ſcarce known in any age ſince Chriſt: but that inſtead of that bread they deſired; he had given them a <hi>Scorpion,</hi> at one time, to ſting both King and Church of <hi>France</hi>: that it was not then with the world as ſome years before (that is before <hi>Luther</hi> appeared:) for that now men believed in Chriſt, not for the womens Teſtimony, (<hi>Joh.</hi> iv.42.) but becauſe they believed the Scriptures, which now they were, but before had not been acquainted with. And that is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, what <hi>Fontindonius</hi> had told us before. If therefore ſuch, even ſuch, as <hi>Fontindonius,</hi> ſo zealous a Romaniſt, ſuch an enemy to Proteſtants; (not to ſpeak here of that famous <hi>Conſilium Delectorum Cardinalium,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>de emendandâ Eccleſia: A. D.</hi> 1538. Printed in divers places; even in ſome editions of Councels to be ſound; though prohibited afterwards, and concealed with all poſſible care) have acknowledged the miſerable condition of the Church before Luther began to ſtir: was there not great need of <hi>Reformation?</hi> What may we think of them, that will not acknowledge it themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:61006:74"/>
and do what they can, to keep others from the knowledge of it?</p>
            <p>I Have now done with the firſt part of this my preſent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, That, before, and at that time, when <hi>Luther</hi> firſt appeared, the Church ſtood in great need of <hi>Reformation</hi>; not in matter of Diſcipline and manners only, which is not denied, though little hath been done to redreſs it: but of Doctrine, and matters of faith, as much as in any thing. This brought us to the buſineſs of <hi>infallibility,</hi> the prime controverſie of theſe times; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we have been the longer, the variety of matter offering it ſelf, partly becauſe of the conſequence; and partly, becauſe of the obſtinate oppoſition of adverſaries who are very ſenſible of the conſequence. What remaineth, a conſideration of the <hi>hindrances,</hi> will be no hard or long work; nor ſubject, as I conceive, to much oppoſition; but of great uſe, if my judgment fail me not, and at this time, not unſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>How it comes to paſs, that after ſo many endeavours, in ſo many years, the <hi>hereticks of theſe times,</hi> (they mean <hi>Proteſtants:</hi>) are not yet converted, or perſwaded, to return to the unity of the Church; that (to uſe ſome of their own words) <hi>nihil adhuc profectum eſt, &amp; de inanibus Catholicorum conatibus haereſes triumphant:</hi> that is, <hi>they that have laboured hitherto, have reaped no benefit of their labours, but hereſies triumph of the vain attempts of the Catholicks</hi>; Some Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts have been curious to inquire into the reaſons. One of them I am ſure, an eminent writer among them; whoſe thoſe words are, I have quoted. Whether it be ſo or no; and whether they have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make a wonder of it; I will not now ſtand to diſpute. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I am that we who certainly believe this <hi>Reformation,</hi> which after ſo many wiſhes and attempts in former ages, begun to take effect not full 150 years ago; was the work of God, and for which all truly ſenſible of piety, and well acquainted with primitive times, are bound to praiſe God heartily; have much more reaſon to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that in few years, having had ſo miraculous a ſucceſſe, it hath made no greater progreſſe ſince: and ſince that, of late years, hath rather loſt, then gained, though there have not wanted at no time, from the firſt beginning, multitudes of able champions to juſtifie
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61006:74"/>
the cauſe (though not to juſtifie the proceedings, in all places) by their writings. A thing it is, I confeſs, which may cauſe ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: eſpecially where the motives, or engagements, are apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as clear and viſible; as they are, certainly, in themſelves ponderous, and of higheſt conſequence.</p>
            <p>But if any be ſcandalized at it, let him conſider the ſeveral ebbings and flowings of Chriſtianity in general, in ſeveral places of the world ſince the firſt beginning of it; in thoſe eſpecially, where it was once moſt flouriſhing, and is now either quite extinct (as in one fourth part of the world:) or brought very low, and under cruel bondage; as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places of great extent: and if he be forced, (as I think he will) to ſay, that theſe be ſecrets of Gods providence, or juſt judgments, which the reaſon of man cannot penetrate into; I think there is in this particular alſo of reformation, as much reaſon, why he ſhould ſubmit, if not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome wondering, or juſt indignation which can hardly be avoided; yet without ſuch ſcandal, as ſhould make him think worſe of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>Laying therefore that aſide, the conſideration of hidden cauſes, which doth not belong unto us; nor of ſuch Politick cauſes, as may be given perchance, by men well acquainted with the State, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the ſeveral Kingdoms, and Commonwealths of <hi>Europe:</hi> we ſhall only take notice of ſuch, which no queſtion can be made of, but that then concurred more or leſs; the knowledg &amp; conſideration of which, may be uſeful, and of ſome conſequence, towards the peace of this Church, which it is our happineſs to be members of. To this purpoſe, that which I ſhall chiefly inſiſt upon, is, to ſhew, that raſh, rigid ſpeeches, opinions, and judgments, pretending to zeal and purity, but for the moſt part, the effects of groſs ignorance, or damnable hypocriſie, or natural fierceneſs (ſuch is the temper of ſome) and precipitancy; have been the moſt <hi>viſible hindrances.</hi> By this, ſome may think, that I intend <hi>Puritaniſme</hi>; which certainly doth always proceed, from ſome one, if not more of thoſe cauſes. If therefore we diſtinguiſh, between the accidentals of <hi>Puritaniſm,</hi> particular objects, and opinions, which may differ according to difference of times, and places; (for even in <hi>England,</hi> the particulars of <hi>Puritaniſme,</hi> have not been always the ſame:) and the eſſentials, or <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of it from which thoſe accidentals uſually flow and proceed; ſo we may call it <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaniſm,</hi> that was the greateſt, or one of the apparent obſtacles, in this bleſſed work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:61006:75"/>But it will not be amiſſe, I think, firſt of all to take ſome notice of him, who was the moſt viſible inſtrument of this great alteration; even <hi>Martin Luther</hi>; who did much pleaſe himſelf, that he was parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly propheſied of by <hi>John Hus,</hi> who had begun the work, and made a good progreſs in it, in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> about a hundred years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther</hi> appeared in <hi>Saxony.</hi> Some words indeed of <hi>John Hus,</hi> are mentioned by many, very expreſs to that purpoſe: who alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verre, that a coin, or medal was ſtamped by the <hi>Bohemians</hi> about that time, containing part of thoſe prophetical words; which medal, I ſuppoſe, hath been ſeen by many. <hi>Ulembergius,</hi> a learned Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt, who hath written <hi>Luthers</hi> life very particularly; and for the moſt part out of <hi>Luthers</hi> own works; where he doth ſet down <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> words, he doth not contradict it, nay doth ſeem rather to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it, by his marginal note: <hi>Vaticinium Hus, de Luthero.</hi> Certainly, ſuch a propheſie well atteſted, and ſtrongly apprehended, as it ſeems it was by <hi>Luther</hi>; muſt needs add much to his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which indeed was extraordinary, and little leſs, without the help of that propheſie, then miraculous. But of this propheſie, and how far <hi>Luther</hi> might rely upon it, as belonging to him, let every man judge, as he thinks fit.</p>
            <p>However, the mention of it, hath given me the opportunity to tell the Reader, if he knew it not, of a very clear propheſie of St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's,</hi> concerning the <hi>Reformation</hi> of religion, then begun in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and the principal (though mute) inſtrument of it, <hi>the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> (whom alſo I find in part, cited by learned <hi>Jewel,</hi> in his <hi>Apologia Eccl. Anglic.</hi>) in his Comments upon the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. chap. of the Prophet <hi>Nahum,</hi> doth tell us firſt, how <hi>perverſa dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi> and <hi>perverſae doctrinae,</hi> through the baits and allurements of the Devill, ſhal prevail in the world; ſo that both Teachers and people ſhall be caſt into a deep ſleep: <hi>non habente ſermone Dei, ubi caput reclinet, cum perverſa dogmata cuncta poſſideant:</hi>) and the word of God ſhall be turn'd out of doors, nor find any reſting place. But, that at the end of the world, before Chriſts coming, the people of God, (<hi>qui ſub magiſtris antea fuerat conſopitus)</hi> who before was kept aſleep by its maſters, or teachers; ſhall then fly to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> (for ſafety:) <hi>and apply themſelves to the reading of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Jerom</hi> wrote this above a thouſand years, before <hi>Luther</hi>; he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:61006:75"/>
might very well think the world would be towards an end, by that time; and beſides, we may hope yet for a further accompliſhment. But whether we have not ſeen the fulfilling of it, in part, ever ſince the <hi>Reformation</hi> began, if any be ſo ignorant or wilfully blind, as not to acknowledg it, I deſire them to conſider once again of <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tindonius,</hi> the <hi>Trent</hi> Orator, his words before ſet down; and with them, of thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> Orators, the then King of <hi>France</hi> his Agent; uttered before the ſaid Councel. I will ſay no more of it; this is more then I intended, but that <hi>John Hus</hi> his propheſie, concerning <hi>Luther,</hi> gave us the occaſion.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Luthers</hi> good parts were, natural and acquired, by which the <hi>Reformation</hi> by him begun, was happily promoted; is not our buſineſs here to inquire: It is certain, he had ſome that did not a little hinder it. He had a great courage: that did well: but he was very paſſionate, and in his paſſion, and anger, what he ſaid, he had no regard at all. He could not indure to be contradicted by any who pretended to reformation: or that any (in <hi>Germany,</hi> at leaſt) ſhould ſhare with him, in the credit of that great work. He was naturally very free to ſpeak any thing that was in his thoughts, without any diſguiſe, or diſſimulation: and ſuch an opinion he had of his calling (being much animated by the ſucceſs:) that inſtead of ſtriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, he uſed this liberty with all ſecurity, as a priviledg of his authority. As reaſon, or paſſion led him, ſo he ſpake, and wrote, with all manner of indifferency; which made ſuch notable contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in his writings, (which have been obſerved by more then one) not to be reconciled, but by the knowledge, and acknowledgment of his infirmities as well as excellencies.</p>
            <p>In his firſt <hi>Auguſtan Confeſſion,</hi> which only the rigid <hi>Lutherans</hi> to this day, acknowledg, and embrace, as genuine; how indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, and moderately, (and yet not with leſs truth, for the moſt part, then moderation: being in ſubſtance the ſame with the ſecond, which <hi>Calvin</hi> did approve and ſubſcribe) did he ſtate all manner of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences? But how differently, ſince that, he wrote when he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge to his paſſion, or was ſet upon aggravation; there be that have made it their buſineſs, to take notice, and to make known: among the reſt, <hi>Bellarmine</hi>; who both in ſome <hi>Orations</hi>; and elſewhere in his <hi>Controverſies,</hi> doth make great uſe of it, to advantage his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:61006:76"/>
cauſe thereby, (which I believe he did; as much, as by any thing:) and to make <hi>Reformation</hi> odious, and deteſtable unto all men, that did not wiſely conſider of it.</p>
            <p>For I ask, Would it not confirm a Proteſtant in his Religion, who is not a ſtranger to the <hi>Articles,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſions</hi> of Faith, ſet out by Proteſtants, concerning the neceſſity of good works: heareth the ſame preached, and preſſed every day, in Sermons: the ſame, in ordinary books of <hi>Devotion</hi> in beſt credit; beſides the known pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, of all accounted pious and religious, among them: to hear a Papiſt, pretending to the knowledg of <hi>Differences,</hi> and <hi>Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> object unto Proteſtants generally; that they maintain the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of faith unto ſalvation; (to <hi>juſtification</hi> indeed, we do: and ſo divers Roman Catholicks:) without works? Or that, to follow <hi>Calvin,</hi> we deny the reality of the body and blood of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, which ſo many Proteſtant Confeſſions profeſs to believe; and <hi>Calvin,</hi> of all Proteſtants, doth in ſo many places, ſo vigorouſly aſſert? Witneſs among others, thoſe words of his: <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiam veri corporis &amp; ſanguinis Jeſu Chriſti, uti ex utero virginis illam ſemel accepit, praeſentem eſſe in Coena, tam fidelibus, quam infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delibus</hi>; who alſo doth acknowledg a great miracle (though no <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi>:) in the buſineſs, and effect of Gods omnipotency, not comprehenſible to man. His whole book againſt <hi>Weſtphalus,</hi> is of that ſubject, to vindicate himſelf and his Doctrine, of that ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Yet theſe be objections made by a late Romaniſt, a great pretender to peace and charity. But when the ſame author, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Engliſh Reformation, doth tell us, ſeriouſly, <hi>that inſtead of the Crucifix upon the rood, a naked Unicorn, to content Luther and Catherine Bore,</hi> was placed; and that marriage was allowed to Prieſts <hi>to ſatisfie</hi> Calvin, <hi>who without ſcruple of irregularity, married a Taylors widdow</hi>: what can a ſober Proteſtant think of ſuch men, who pretending to ſobriety and moderation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fiat lux. p.</hi> 250.251.</note> are not aſhamed, to our faces, ſo baſely, ſo unworthily, to traduce, and calumniate: how can he believe them in any thing?</p>
            <p>When therefore Papiſts have been told by ſome Proteſtants (to inſtance in one particular:) that before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> they had no knowledg of Chriſt nor of the benefit of his Croſs;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:61006:76"/>
the free remiſſion of ſins, and juſtification, through faith: ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their ordinary <hi>Rituals</hi> (as by divers Papiſts and Proteſtants, hath been aſſerted and objected:) and ſo contrary to ſo many books of <hi>Devotion,</hi> in uſe and credit among them: muſt they not in all probability, ſuſpect every thing to be of the ſame nature, and have a worſe opininion of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and all Proteſtants, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall?</p>
            <p>But of all things in this kind, wherein the inconſiderate zeal, or ignorant, uncharitable raſhneſs of ſome Proteſtants, hath been to blame, my opinion is, that nothing hath done more hurt to the cauſe, to hinder the progreſs of <hi>Reformation,</hi> and to advantage the adverſaries of it, then the denying of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be a true Church. <hi>Quin &amp; eò ventum eſt, &amp;c.</hi> that is, <hi>Nay it is come to that,</hi> (ſaith learned judicious <hi>Caſſander) that ſome (which is the propriety of ſchiſme) have made bold to bereave this Church</hi> (the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) <hi>of the title and poſſeſſion of a true Catholick Church; and to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate it unto themſelves, as their own peculiar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed, is a matter of higheſt moment, on which as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the ſtanding or falling of Chriſtianity, in general, doth not a little depend. For ſince it is well known, that moſt errors of Popery, began to prevail over all Chriſtianity, or the greateſt part; (in <hi>Europe,</hi> at leaſt:) a thouſand years before <hi>Luther</hi>; (though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very age did afford ſome, that did vigorouſly oppoſe them:) and that Chriſtianity, in other parts of the world, hath ſuffered, though not ſo much perchance, nor in the ſame kind; yet ſuffered not a little: if all this while, Chriſt hath had no viſible Church in the world, but here, and there in ſome corners; I know not what to make of all the propheſies of the Old Teſtament: and if ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny propheſies, ſo plain, ſo full, ſo direct (as by <hi>St. Auguſtine</hi> in his books, <hi>De veritate Eccleſiae,</hi> is diſputed, and proved, at large:) come to nothing; truly I know not, what we may truſt to. To me, it doth appear no leſs, then, if not a direct, yet an implicit (if the conſequence be rightly weighed;) abjuration of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And were it ſo indeed, that Proteſtants generally, did require any ſuch profeſſion, or ſubſcription; I think that were ground e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for any conſcientious man, to avoid their communion: as on the other ſide, were there nothing elſe to be objected to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61006:77"/>
but this one thing; their uncharitable proſcribing, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating of all Chriſtians, in all parts of the world, who are not of their communion; and obliging all that adhere unto them, to profeſs the ſame; I ſhould think that one thing, a juſt ground of Separation, or forſaking of their communion. And I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg when I conſider with grief of the calamities, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, Chriſtianity in general, hath received, by the increaſe of Mahometiſme: though I am ſorry, that ſo much ſuperſtition is gone along; yet it is no ſmall comfort, to think of the converſion of the <hi>Americans.</hi> And though my comfort would be greater, if, as I ſaid, leſs ſuperſtition had gone along; yet even in that, I receive no ſmall ſatisfaction, when I read the ſpeeches made to ſome Indians, concerning Chriſtianity, wherein I find nothing, that can give juſt offence; but true and pure Chriſtianity delivered: as particularly in a book intituled, <hi>The Hiſtory of the Miſſion of three Capuchins to the Iſle of</hi> Maragnan, &amp;c. <hi>by the R.

            <p>This therefore I conceive, was a great hinderance, to the progreſs of <hi>Reformation</hi>; when many (through miſinformation) apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that inſtead of <hi>Reformation,</hi> a new Religion was intended, not known, or heard of, (but here and there in ſome corners:) for the ſpace of a thouſand years: whereupon muſt follow (which many were ready to infer, and to exaggerate:) that as many (Fathers, and Forefathers) as were dead in the mean time, though otherwiſe never ſo pious in ſight; were dead in their ſins, as Heathens, and Infidels. Now, though this never was the Doctrine of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, in general; as will appear by and by: yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but ſome Proteſtants in very deed (if I may call them <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> whom I know not how to account Chriſtians; except ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and not want of <hi>charity</hi> be their plea:) have been of that opinion; and even before our late confuſions, by which true Chriſtianity did ſuffer ſuch an Ecclipſe in this Land; a learned and pious Biſhop was much put to it, by the Puritanical party, for this very thing, becauſe he had ſaid, The Roman Church was, or is, a true Church. Though his credit, and deſervingly, was great; yet, no leſs then an expreſs Apology; and after that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (which are extant:) would ſerve the turn, to acquit him

And even ſince that, in this late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal interruption of government, one of that worſhipful company, that were appointed <hi>Examiners</hi> of them that were to be ordained, or beneficed; whereof <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> (a very fit man for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for by the queſtions they were wont to ask, a man cannot tell what they aimed at, except it was to advance <hi>Quakiſme,</hi> or make way for <hi>Mahometiſm</hi>:) was the head: but one of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful company, did publickly, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:61006:78"/>That which hath made many wary and ſcrupulous how they ſpeak, in this particular; is, the advantage the Papiſts make of our conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with ordinary ſimple people; when they inferr upon it, that therefore their communion muſt be the ſafeſt way, becauſe we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them a Church; and by conſequent, a poſſibility of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in it: they, (that is, the hot-headed or ignorant Zealots, of their ſide:) not ours ſo: whereas in very truth, (and they will acknowledge it, who are well acquainted with the Doctrine of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity:) it is one main advantage of our cauſe, that though we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from them in many things; nay, charge rhem with many groſs, peſtilent errors, and abuſes: yet becauſe they ſtill keep to the main fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, we do not exclude them from the Catholick Church; though by their hard and rigid cenſures, and excommunications of us, and all others that do not hold with them; they do very much hazard their right and title, to the ſaid Catholick Church; as much, as by any thing.</p>
            <p>But this hath been conſidered of before, and their Arguments for this pretended advantage fully diſcuſſed: whether, (if he have not been there already) I referr the Reader, who doth deſire further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this point. Our occaſion here, is onely to obſerve, that this one thing; the denying the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the being of a Church, in the communion of which, they that have lived and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; or do yet; wanting the means, ignorantly; by the advantage of the main fundamentals, and a godly life, may poſſibly be ſaved: which ſome Proteſtants raſhly, and ignorantly; or rigidly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably, too much yielding to their own tempers, and humors, have done: hath been a great <hi>hinderance</hi> of <hi>Reformation.</hi> And I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe, the opinion moſt Papiſts are kept in, that the Religion of Proteſtants, is a <hi>new</hi> Religion; is not of little force, to make them averſe from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this day.</p>
            <p>It is well known, how bitterly rigid <hi>Lutherans</hi> judge generally, of the Proteſtants, that are not of their opinion. Papiſts (ordinary Papiſts) may be thought charitable, in compariſon. Yet no provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation could make other Proteſtants, far more in number, and every way much more conſiderable, to requite them, or to imitate their uncharitableneſs, and virulency: though they make great boaſt of it, and make no ſmall advantage of it among themſelves, to maintain
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61006:79"/>
their own party; by their inſultation. Yet for all that, they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Brethren,</hi> whether they will, or no: the <hi>French</hi> Churches, even lately, in a Synode of theirs at <hi>Charanton</hi>; have declared them ſo. I wiſh we had no greater differences with the Papiſts: however, if moderation and charity towards the one, be commendable; (as who would not commend it?) notwithſtanding their uncharitable provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: why ſhould not we be as charitable (ſo farr as the cauſe will bear:) towards the Papiſts, in our judgments, and deſerve commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for it; though they judge of us no better (for worſe they can not:) then the <hi>Lutherans?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another great <hi>hinderance,</hi> noted and acknowledged by all men, and concerning which divers Books have been written, which give an Hiſtorical account of all actions and proceedings, private, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, in that buſineſs; is the difference that did ariſe among Proteſtants concerning the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt. So much hath been written of it, and of the ſad effects and conſequences, that I ſhall onely name it here, and no more.</p>
            <p>Other particulars there be, of the ſame nature; which I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon; if I intended a perfect ſearch, and diſquiſition. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my chiefeſt intent, is, to inſiſt upon thoſe things, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſideration whereof, may be of ſome concernment to us, of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; I ſhall confine my ſelf to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of one particular, of <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> which as it was at firſt, a great <hi>hinderance</hi> to the progreſs of <hi>Reformation,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and elſewhere: So hath it been the occaſion of great troubles and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, to the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and ſometimes hazarded the beauty and glory of its <hi>Reformation,</hi> (by all Proteſtants, that have any knowledge of former times, and do not unchriſtianly contract the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> to preſent and particular <hi>Congregations,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged:) by baſe, unworthy compliances with the <hi>defects,</hi> (that I ſay not, <hi>deformity:</hi>) of ſome other Churches.</p>
            <p>Whileſt the chief Reformers were buſie about material points, wherein true Chriſtian-Faith had ſuffered great detriment; which every day appeared more and more, and begun ſo far to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged every where, that all States and places, did even thirſt for a ſound and ſubſtantial <hi>Reformation:</hi> the Devil, who had tried many ways, to hinder and oppoſe what he could, and yet ſaw himſelf in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61006:79"/>
great danger: (God for other ſecret cauſes, but apparent infirmities of ſome chief actors, and unworthineſs of others, who ſhould have reaped the benefit; permitting, or not hindering:) this great Enemy of incorrupted Truth and Religion, ſtirred up a Sect of men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Flaccius Illyricus,</hi> and one <hi>Joach. Weſtphalus,</hi> were chief leaders, and abettors; who under colour of <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> deſpiſed, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted all Authority; preached rebellion, and ſedition, as lawfull, for that which they called <hi>Religion</hi>; charged the moſt eminent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, with Idolatry, Apoſtacy, Infidelity, and the like, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſome ancient <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> ſome, for themſelves, as ancient, and uſefull: others, for peace and unities ſake, as things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. Like ſo many Furies of Hell, or <hi>Bedlams,</hi> that had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their bonds, by Preſs and Pulpit, and all manner of ways, they filled the world, with their out-cries, and reproaches; by which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were not a little terrified; but many more, who before had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great inclination to it, ſcandalized, even to a hatred and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all <hi>Reformation.</hi> In the mean time, the Zelots for the Popes power, and great Patrons of all inveterated Superſtitions; made great advantage of it, to countenance their rigour and obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, on the other ſide; and wholly bent themſelves (which was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly proſecuted by the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi>) to make the breach as irreconcileable, as they could poſſibly make it, even unto all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: placing henceforth the greateſt ſtrength of their own ſafety and ſecurity, in the proſcribing, and anathematizing of all diſſenters, as damned Apoſtates, and Infidels. This is the grand myſtery of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitiſme, and politick Popery, at this day: to look upon all mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate counſels, as pernicious and deſtructive; to fear nothing more, and to hinder as much as they can, leſt any man with calmneſs and indifferency (that is, not preoccupied and prepoſſeſſed with opinion and prejudice) ſhould enquire into the occaſion of this unhappy breach, and the true ſtate of <hi>Reformation.</hi> It is their advantage, and that which they earneſtly labour for, that every difference may be made a Hereſie; yea, flat Idolatry, or Apoſtacy: whether they impeach us, or we impeach them, in that kind, it matters not; the advantage they make of it is the ſame. So that in very truth, Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites and Puritans, by two contrary extremities, are the great props, and intereſt of Popery: and though particular Papiſts, may ſuffer in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61006:80"/>
ſome places, by the fierceneſs of <hi>Puritans</hi>; and <hi>Puritans,</hi> in other, by the fierceneſs of ſuch Papiſts: yet that is not conſiderable, in compariſon of what the cauſe doth get in general, by thoſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, on both ſides.</p>
            <p>What were the particular <hi>Rites,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that were ſo fiercely impugned, and the occaſion of ſuch diviſion; I ſhall not now make any inquiry: of <hi>rites</hi> and <hi>ceremonies</hi> in general, the queſtion was, that is certain, whether in their own nature <hi>indifferent,</hi> (whence the name, or crimination of <hi>adiaphoriſtae,</hi> ſo frequent in that Hiſtory, ſprung:) and whether any might be retained, that had been abuſed, the abuſe being taken away: the one (the ſober and moderate) maintaining the affirmative: the pretended zealots, as peremptorily charging them with Popery, Idolatry, Apoſtacy, and I know not what, for the opinion. The <hi>Surplice,</hi> I remember, was one great particular, concerning which ſtrange things were delivered by that Fanatick crew; as though whole Chriſtianity had been hazarded, nay loſt, by the uſing of it. But I will refer my Reader, if he deſire a further account, to the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of thoſe times: eſpecially to them that have written the life of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Melanchthon</hi>: which incomparable man, as he excelled in piety and learning; ſo he was the principal object of their revilings, and threatnings.</p>
            <p>This is all I intended of the <hi>viſible hinderances</hi> of Reformation; the obſervation whereof, I thought, would be of ſome uſe, to thoſe that have any intereſt in this particular (of all reformed, the moſt eminent) Church of <hi>England.</hi> I ſhall yet before I end, commend ſome things to the Readers conſideration; which upon the ſame ſubject of <hi>ceremonies,</hi> as I was writing what hath been written before; did offer themſelves; and I have done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to the Papiſts: Great braggs they make of their <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and their antiquity. We cannot deny, but many of them are ancient: now laid aſide for good reaſons, by the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But firſt; Can they make it appear that the ſubſtance of Faith which doth Conſtitute a Catholick Church, was ever thought by the ancients, to conſiſt in part, or in whole, in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies? Who doth not know, what ancient fathers have ſaid and determined, concerning this matter of <hi>Ceremonies?</hi> What no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61006:80"/>
variety, and in ſome things, contrariety hath been obſerved by ancient Eccleſiaſtical writers, in divers parts of the world; where one faith was acknowledged and profeſſed.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly: they have retained many; ancient, we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; which we have not: but withall, they have many articles of faith; never heard of in the primitive times; which we have not, we praiſe God for it. They will not acknowledg it, I confeſs; except ſome here, or there, that are more ingenuous then the reſt: but it hath been proved, and will be proved yet, if need be, and made as manifeſt and viſible, as the light of the Sun at noon day may be to them that have eyes, and will not ſhut them of purpoſe, leſt they ſhould ſee.</p>
            <p>But again, (a <hi>third</hi> anſwer, or obſervation:) They have many that are ancient; which we have not: we grant it. But have they all, or near all; of that nature? I will undertake, let all their rites, and cuſtoms, that are truly ancient, be put together: we will give an account, when it ſhall be required, of ſo many more, at leaſt, ancient alſo, which are now, and have been, theſe many years, antiquated, and out of uſe. The reader may be better ſatisfied that the thing is very feaſable, who ſhall but peruſe thoſe that have written <hi>de antiquis Baptiſmi, &amp; Miſſae ritibus; Joſephus Vicecomes,</hi> particularly; who hath taken greateſt pains: in two tomes, in 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi>; Printed at <hi>Milan,</hi> 1620.</p>

Well, if it be not; all I ſhall ſay of it, they were to blame; were it but for antiquity ſake, that firſt left it out.

               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:61006:81"/>Thirdly, and laſtly, we ſay: The Church of <hi>England,</hi> though for the abuſe and other good conſiderations, it hath laid aſide divers Ceremonies, that are acknowledged ancient: yet it doth not condemn any, that have been anciently and univerſally uſed, (as then uſed:) as impious, or idolatrous: nor doth think that, a juſt cauſe of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, from any other Church, that uſeth them, as then uſed: whereby it doth fully acquit it ſelf of all imputation of ſchiſme, or breach of Communion with the ancient Church; upon that ſcore: which they that do, that raſhly and furiouſly cenſure all they do not like (the right <hi>Puritanical</hi> humor:) for Popiſh, impious, idolatrous and the like; are guilty of: and by that means, though they do not all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed perchance to that degree of madneſs, as to deny the ancient Church, to have been a true Church, therefore: yet truly, they do it great wrong; and give the Papiſts great advantage (which they make great uſe of) by making Popery to be ſo ancient: more ancient, by ſome hundred of years, then ſound Proteſtants can, or will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it. For it is not the uſing, or not uſing of ſuch, or ſuch a <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi>; (where the duty of obedience to ſuperiors, doth not oblige the conſcience) that is ſo conſiderable in it ſelf: but raſh, uncharitable cenſuring, and condemning of others, or ſeparating from them for ſuch things, which of their own nature are indifferent: which muſt needs proceed from great ignorance, (as we would charitably hope, of moſt:) or a worſe cauſe. The Papiſt the refore have no reaſon at all to be offended; nor can take any advantage at all, of the doctrine or practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in this point; which hath uſed ſuch moderation, ſuch wonderfull caution, to prevent all juſt offence: but what they can ſay for themſelves, for retaining ſo many idle, ſuperſtitious (to ſay no more as now uſed:) ceremonies, by which the conſciences of men are intolerably burdened; and Religion it ſelf the ſubſtance of it, clouded, oppreſſed, and very much indangered: as by many moderate Papiſts (by Kings and Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others; witneſs the Letters of <hi>Charles</hi> the II.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exemplar. liter</hi> &amp;c. Paris 1557 &amp; p. 204. &amp; 212.</note> King of <hi>France,</hi> to the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi>:) hath been in part, if not altogether acknowledged, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained; I know not, nor they neither, I believe, if they would deal truly, and ingenuouſly.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe among us, who have been, or are yet guilty of ſuch
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61006:82"/>
raſh, and uncharitable cenſures, in this matter of <hi>Ceremonies</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they have cauſed, (beſides the advantage given to Papiſts) great troubles in this Church, and are yet ready, many of them, to ſet all on fire again, upon this very ſcore of Popiſh, Idolatrous Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: which they have ever found their readieſt <hi>Incentivum</hi> to work upon ignorant or diſaffected people; and therefore, as a neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to themſelves, againſt any good occaſion, are ſo loth to part with: I have but little to add, to what hath been ſaid by others, and whether poſſible to light upon any thing, that hath not been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled, I make a queſtion. But I ſhall adventure upon ſomewhat, I do not remember to have met with elſewhere: which I will commend to their conſideration, whoſe ſenſes, proper ends and Intereſt, or reſolved and obſtinate partiality, hath not obſtructed.</p>
            <p>In civil worldly things, that outward viſible Signs and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have great power and influence upon men, ordinarily, to beget affection, or reverence; is acknowledged by wiſeſt men and Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth obſerve (and ſome have made uſe, I know, of the obſervation, but upon another occaſion) that <hi>Cato,</hi> though he was a man of great integrity, in his ordinary converſation, and very incorrupt in his judgments, as a Magiſtrate: yet did more hurt to the Commonweal of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the contempt he brought upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and higheſt Courts, by his contempt of outward apparel, and carriage, in his place: then he did good by his exemplary innocency of life, and approved uprightneſs, in adminiſtration of juſtice. I will not deny, but true Religion may ſuffer by too much, and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed formality: but the contempt of all Ceremonies, muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to be the high-way to Atheiſme; or no Religion at all: which is the worſe of the two.</p>
            <p>I remember I have read in <hi>Calvin,</hi> of a certain <hi>Staff,</hi> which was the <hi>Inſigne</hi> or proper badge of Supreme Authority, in that Town where he lived. He calleth it <hi>ſacrum baculum; a ſacred ſtaff</hi>; and ſaith plainly, that the people generally gave ſo much reſpect to it, that the very ſight of it (when the authority of the perſons did not, or could not: ſo I underſtand him:) did appeaſe tumults, and prevent ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: ſo that the breaking of that <hi>ſtaff,</hi> in a tumult, which at other times did uſe to appeaſe tumults, was looked upon, as higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and rebellion. How ſhould that <hi>Staff,</hi> I wonder, become
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61006:82"/>
ſo <hi>ſacred,</hi> and of ſuch authority in the eyes of the people; but as it was an outward ſign (confirmed by long uſe and time) of power and authority? The perſons, to whom the reverence was properly due, often changed; but the Staff ſtill continuing the ſame, long time, and accuſtomance, was of that force, that it added reverence to the perſons, and contributed not a little to the maintenance of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which was due unto them. If this be the nature of men, in point of <hi>Signs,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> civil: why ſhould not Religious <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> (uſed with moderation, and diſcretion) be a help to devotion, and a preſervation to reverence, as well? We have had ſad experience in our late confuſions, when the very Prayers of men, firſt brought into contempt, by their unmannerly ſitting, and other misbehaviour in the Church; were heard by many, as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ballads, in the ſtreets; and indeed, were not better (many times;) by their affected non-ſenſe, (though I believe, many could not help it:) and familiarity with Almighty God. Was this <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation according to the beſt,</hi> or worſt Reformed Churches? But we may eaſily gueſs, what was intended by the contrivers of that horrid Oath; and the contempt of God, and all holy <hi>Rites,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> was a viſible effect of it.</p>
            <p>It is true, when a Rite or Ceremony, though never ſo good and warrantable, hath been diſuſed in a place, or never uſed; it may ſeem ſtrange at firſt; as apparel, that a man hath not been uſed unto, though never ſo comely of it ſelf; by children, and fools, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: (ſuch I mean, that know little of the world, beſides the place of their birth, and uſual abode) is looked upon with admiration, if not deriſion. But wiſer men, who judge of what they ſee, by the nature of things, and not by vulgar apprehenſions; they will ſoon be ſatisfied, if their reaſon be ſatisfied. Yet ſome men, though wiſe and prudent enough, otherwiſe, (too much auſterity, perchance, may be ſome cauſe:) have naturally ſuch an antipathy to <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> that Nature (if they look not to it carefully) will ſooner overcome their Reaſon; then Reaſon, their Nature. But there is danger in it: not onely becauſe raſh cenſures, in this kind, may give juſt offence, and cauſe diviſions amongſt Brethren: but becauſe, by yielding too much to nature, we may condemn them ſometimes unwarily, to whom we acknowledge all ſubmiſſion and reverence to be due; and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61006:83"/>
ſo condemn our ſelves, at the ſame time, though againſt our wills, that we condemn them. But I ſhall be better underſtood, by giving an example.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. among other arguments, by which he doth prove the Reſurrection of the Dead; or rather doth reprove their inconſtancy in the Faith, that denied it: one is, in theſe words, <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>What ſhall they do, that are baptized for the dead, if the dead riſe not, why are they then baptized for the dead?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many wayes, theſe words by ſeveral Expoſitors, and other learned men, are interpreted, and what I my ſelf think moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, I will not take upon me to give the Reader an account, not for the difficulty, but becauſe it would not be much to our purpoſe. The moſt obvious, and literal Interpretation, certainly; much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the obſervation of a very learned Philologiſt, of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> by theſe words, doth allude to the cuſtome of ſome of that time, and Church; which was, if any converted to the Chriſtian Faith, died unbaptized, to ſubſtitute another to be baptized for him, though dead. That this was done really, by divers in the Primitive times, we have the clear teſtimony of ſome ancient Fathers, and others: as <hi>Tertullian, Chryſoſtome, Epiphanius</hi>; whom learned <hi>Juſtellus,</hi> in his Notes upon the <hi>Codicem Can. Eccleſ. Univerſ.</hi> doth cite. But thoſe they ſpeak of, the <hi>Cerinthians</hi> and <hi>Marcioniſts,</hi> beſides that they were Hereticks, were not then in being, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote. And whether they were the firſt inſtitutors of it, (which is poſſible; grounding upon thoſe very words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as they underſtood them; as <hi>Theophylact</hi> doth intimate:) or whether they received it from ſome that lived when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote; doth not appear by thoſe teſtimonies. However, as I ſaid before; the moſt obvious and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral ſenſe, that can be made of the words, is, to underſtand them as ſpoken of ſuch a cuſtome or practice, by ſome of that Church, to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> did write. And it doth appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both by the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Canon of <hi>Codex Eccleſiae Afric.</hi> and by the 83. Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in <hi>Trullo,</hi> that it continued a cuſtome a long time, in divers Churches, among them that were no Hereticks. Thoſe firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, certainly, did by it, innocently teſtifie their Faith, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> belief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerning the Reſurrection of the Dead; their charity
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61006:83"/>
alſo prompting them, to uſe all means imaginable, though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or at all neceſſary, to ſecure them that were dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> St. <hi>Paul</hi> (it muſt be gtanted, if it were his meaning, as there is great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility:) ſaw no hurt in it; and therefore doth mention it, without reproof. But <hi>Calvin,</hi> a rigid man naturally, againſt <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and ever ſuſpicious of the worſt, he calls it, <hi>a profanation of Baptiſm: a wicked heatheniſh ſuperſtition; a ſacrilegious, and Magical abuſe of Baptiſm:</hi> and will by no means allow, though he grant it the <hi>moſt rceceived</hi> interpretation, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be ſo underſtood. It is well, he would not have St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be a Patron of Magick. But what if <hi>Calvin's</hi> interpretation of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> words, be thought by others, forced, violent, not at all probable: and that other, which he doth ſo reject, as countenancing thoſe <hi>abominations,</hi> (as he would have it:) be thought the onely true, or that hath any probability and this, by Proteſtants of good credit, who lived in <hi>Geneva,</hi> ſince <hi>Calvin?</hi> Was not <hi>Diodat</hi> a man of ſome credit, in <hi>Geneva</hi>; and his <hi>Annotations</hi> upon the Scripture, in great eſteem? Well; what ſaith he upon theſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in his third and laſt Editions of his <hi>Annotations</hi>; as he is expreſſed, (for I have not the Original <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> at this time:) by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlator? <hi>Which are baptized for the dead:</hi> ſo St. <hi>Paul: From this manner of ſpeech</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>it appears, that the Apoſtle means not an ordinary Rite of the Church, but a particular cuſtome of ſome Chriſtians; of whom Antiquity makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and it ſhould ſeem, that the beginning thereof, was, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether good, and laudable; yet, at leaſt, tolerable. Which was, that when any one died in the confeſſion of Chriſts Faith, before he could receive Baptiſm; ſome of his kindred or friends,</hi> &amp;c. And again: <hi>The end of this particular Ceremony was, the profeſſion of the expectation of the bleſſed Reſurrection of Believers. In following Ages, this thing came to be an abuſe, and ſuperſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame Interpretation is followed by learned <hi>Hugo Grotius.</hi> And the <hi>Jews</hi> have a cuſtome to this day, (when it began, I know not:) if a child die before he be circumciſed; that is, before the eighth day; he is circumciſed nevertheleſs, and a name given him over his grave: as <hi>Buxtorfius,</hi> and others teſtifie. Certainly, beſides pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Faith; there was ſomewhat in this cuſtome very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, to keep people in the opinion of the uſe, and neceſſity
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:61006:84"/>
(ordinarily) of Baptiſm: which was much better, then that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible contempt of it (and of Chriſt himſelf, in it:) which among <hi>Preciſians</hi> and <hi>Puritans</hi>; as in our late confuſions, to the great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage (as to the ordinary means:) of innocent ſouls, and as great ſcandal of true Orthodox Chriſtians, did appear unto all men; is uſual and ordinary: and not of Baptiſm onely, but of the Euchariſt alſo: which <hi>Calvin</hi> (this contempt of it, I mean) did ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Now if this were St. <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, for which there is ſo much probability; and is ſo poſitively and peremptorily maintained, where <hi>Calvins</hi> name is yet in greateſt credit: what ſhall we ſay, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was much to blame, for his apparant countenancing of ſo <hi>heatheniſh, magical, an abuſe and ſuperſtition</hi>; as <hi>Calvin</hi> doth cenſure this cuſtome? or that <hi>Calvin</hi> was much to blame, to judge ſo raſhly and rigidly of a cuſtome, which if not altogether <hi>good and laudable</hi>; (to uſe <hi>Diodate's</hi> words) yet was <hi>tolerable:</hi> and, as a bare profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Faith, (as then uſed:) and due reſpect unto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm, we might ſay, very commendable; but it will ſerve, (if St. <hi>Paul</hi> were in the right:) to ſay, not to be excepted againſt.</p>
            <p>But for <hi>Calvin,</hi> though he was a rigid man, naturally; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in point of <hi>Ceremonies</hi>; and might over-ſhoot himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in his cenſures and opinions; yet he was a godly pious man, otherwiſe; a man of great worth, and parts; and by what he writes of ſome particular Ceremonies; in ſome places, very moderately; but eſpecially, of the neceſſity, or expediency, at leaſt, of a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Liturgie</hi>; we may probably gueſs, had he lived in <hi>England,</hi> and been better acquainted with the true ſtate of buſineſſes, he would have been of another mind, in many things. But what ſhall we ſay of them, who (to paſs by what they have done, when the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the times gave them the opportunity; which, I wiſh hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their preſent carriage would ſuffer us altogether to forget:) are yet ready to cry out againſt whatſoever they allow not, (a <hi>Surplice,</hi> perchance, or <hi>the ſign of the Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm; and the like:) as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, Antichriſtian, Idolatrous; and would have the world believe, that Conſcience is the cauſe of theſe out-cries: what ſhall we ſay of them? That theſe be <hi>the Saints; the beloved of the Lord,</hi>

with him for ever?</hi> Doth he not mean, the only true Chriſtians of the world? I know not what other ſence to make of the words. O horror! O infatuation! O deluded people!</p>
            <p>Deluded? They that are ſo againſt their wills, they may be pitied. But with the Readers leave, <hi>I</hi> will for concluſion, give the world an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (<hi>I</hi> know not any now living, that can do it better) of a buſineſs which once in the days of King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory occaſioned much talk; whereby it will appear clearly, that theſe men, theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <hi>anticeremonial, antiprelatical</hi> men, generally; (or many of them, at leaſt:) are willing to be deluded, and wilfully delude others: being perſwaded, it ſeems (which we noted of Popiſh zealots, before) that no means are unlawfull, whereby the cauſe may be advanced.</p>
            <p>In the year of the Lord 1624<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a book was ſet out, intituled: <hi>The original of idolatries; or, The birth of Hereſies. Firſt faithfully gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of ſundry Greek and Latine Authors; as alſo out of divers learned Fathers: By that famous and learned</hi> Iſaac Caſaubon, <hi>and by him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in French, for the good of Gods Church: And was tranſlated in Engliſh for the benefit of this Monarchy: By ABRAHAM DARCIE.</hi> I was then a young Student in <hi>Oxford.</hi> I heard of the book, and great commendations of it, before I ſaw it. When I had ſeen it, and read ſome part; I know not whether more ſenſible of the ignorance, that poſſeſſeth ordinary men; or of the wrong that was done to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particularly; but troubled I was, I am ſure, very much: and that which moſt troubled me, was the report of the acceptation the book had found at the hands, as of many others; generally; ſo of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and learned King, particularly, whom I knew very able, as moſt men in the Realm, to judge of ſuch ware. The cheif end, and ſubject of the book, I found, was to prove, that the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> (a word of great extent and antiquity; which made the Authors of the <hi>Auguſtane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> ſubſcribed by <hi>Calvin,</hi> ſay, <hi>Falſò accuſantur Eccleſiae noſtrae, quod miſſam aboleant: retinetur enim miſſa apud nos, &amp; ſummâ rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiâ celebratur.)</hi> or rather indeed the whole <hi>Liturgy</hi>; ancient and late; and every part of it; was derived from ancient Heathens, <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> and I know not whom: ſome part alſo taken out of the <hi>Alcoran</hi>: which to prove, his Authors, for the moſt part, are ſome late collectors of Roman Antiquities, as <hi>Blondus, Alexander ab Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andro,</hi> and the like; who ſay no ſuch thing: but from what they ſay
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:61006:85"/>
of the Romans, he makes his inferences and applications, as he liſt himſelf; more like the dreams of a diſtempered man, then the words of a man endowed with ordinary ſence and reaſon. Truly, I could as ſoon have been perſwaded, that all the ballads that were ſung in <hi>London,</hi> thoſe four years my Father lived there, were of his making, as to believe he had any hand in that book: and I further believe, that himſelf, had he been alive, had as eaſily digeſted, to have been thought the Author of the one, as of the other. But a fierce book it is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ceremonies</hi>: againſt <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Popery:</hi> that is enough to ſatisfie thoſe, who are ſuch friends to <hi>zeal,</hi> that they ſtand not at all, upon <hi>truth,</hi> or <hi>knowledg</hi>; the proper character of a <hi>Puritan</hi> or a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well: though <hi>Nathaniel Butter,</hi> the Bookſeller, that vented them; had told me before-hand, when he ſaw I did not like the buſineſs, he was ſure, I ſhould have no thanks, if I did queſtion the book; and bid me earneſtly, to conſider of it: yet I was reſolved, whatever came of it to do my utmoſt, to do the truth, and my Father right. I firſt addreſſed my ſelf to ſome, to whom by their place, as I conceived, the cogniſance of ſuch things, did moſt properly belong, but there indeed, though otherwiſe, and upon other occaſions, looked upon with favour enough, I had little thanks, it was far from it. After that, I had no hopes, but in the King; to whom <hi>I</hi> was well known; as my Father had been before, much more. The King was then at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> remember: <hi>I</hi> addreſſed my ſelf to one of thoſe Reverend Biſhops, who uſually waited upon the King. By whoſe means a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mine being ſhewed unto the King; (who indeed had received the book, becauſe it bare my Fathers name, with much gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation; but had not yet had the leiſure to look into it:) after he had pawſed a while, and as <hi>I</hi> was told, examined ſome places; grew into a great paſſion, that ſuch a cheat was put upon him, and others. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that ſome were put to it, to make their peace, whom the King apprehended acceſſories by their neglect, or the neglect of thoſe, whom they truſted: and ſuddenly after, <hi>Nathaniel Butter,</hi> the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller; and <hi>Abraham Darcy,</hi> the Tranſlater, were committed. This <hi>Darcy</hi> was a man of a very bad life, generally; and lived, or made uſe, at leaſt (as <hi>I</hi> was told by one of the Miniſters of the French <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> who ſaid he had been charged by their <hi>Conſiſtory</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:61006:85"/>
about it:) towards his living, of an imployment ſo baſe, and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, that the very name is baſe, and offenſive to modeſt ears. Upon this, the noiſe was all <hi>London</hi> over, (and <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe it went further:) that the Popiſh Biſhops, at the Court, by their calumnies and miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, had ſet on the King againſt a godly book, and ſome god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, by whoſe means it had been publiſhed. I am very ſure, that liberal ſupplies of mony were ſent from ſome, that were very near the King, to the Tranſlator; whilſt he was in priſon: who (ſome others having, at laſt, with much importunity, mitigated the King to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment:) thereby inſtead of puniſhment, made a benefit of his impriſonment. Yet before this, (which is the thing I would have the Reader take good notice of) a French book, the original of the Engliſh tranſlation; being produced; it had been found out, that an old title page, had been, by art, and cunning, transformed; the years altered, and the name of <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon</hi> inſerted; and thus the world for meer gain and lucre, (for I do not believe, that there was any further myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it, at the firſt:) ſhamefully abuſed. Other editions, or copies of the ſame book, were found, and ſhewed to the King; yea tranſlations of it, that had been made, when my father was yet ſcarce born. Beſides ſomwhat had been written and publiſhed by me, in the Latin tongue, in <hi>Vindication</hi> of my Father; which by the Kings command, had been tranſlated into French, and Engliſh: all this, whilſt the buſineſs was yet freſh, and in frequent debate; or ſoon after.</p>
            <p>A man would think, there had been enough done (beſides the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the book it ſelf, before ſpoken of:) to ſatisfie the world; if apparent truth and viſible evidences, would have done it. Yet for all this, ſome years after, the ſame book, or Engliſh tranſlation, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain (we may gueſs by whoſe procurement) reprinted; where, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell certainly; but at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> I gueſs: with this title: <hi>The Original of Popiſh Idolatry: or, The birth of hereſies. Publiſhed under the name of</hi> Caſaubon; <hi>and called in the ſame year, upon miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. But now upon better conſideration, reprinted with allowance, Being a true and exact deſcription &amp;c. Printed</hi>—1630. A preface alſo was added, in juſtification of the book, and firſt editors of it: where among others of the ſame ſtuffe, theſe words are: <hi>that they that did ſuppreſs it, were either Papiſts in their hearts; or ſuch as hold with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that ignorance is the mother of devotion: that the Goſpel of our Lord
<pb facs="tcp:61006:86"/>
Jeſus Chrſt, was departing from the land,</hi> &amp;c. and the like. And ſince that, a baſe Pamphlet came out, <hi>I</hi> know not where Printed, much to the ſame purpoſe; in the very front whereof, theſe goodly words are; by way of approbation: <hi>D.

Quod ego Caſauboni pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſum judico digniſſimum, quod typographiae beneficio, ad manus plurium perveniat.</hi> It is but ſhort, but all of the ſame ſtrain, and ſpirit, as the former book, to which it doth referr.</p>
            <p>Evidences <hi>I</hi> know are obvious enough; and we needed not have looked back ſo far; (later times have afforded ſtore;) how much thoſe men (<hi>I</hi> ſpeak it of the generality:) regard <hi>truth,</hi> or <hi>ſincerity,</hi> when lying and juggling will advantage the cauſe. But becauſe <hi>I</hi> was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly intereſted, in this account, <hi>I</hi> hope the Reader will accept of it, and make good uſe, (my chiefeſt aim:) as occaſion ſhall offer it ſelf.</p>
