         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I had this of an ingenious Gentleman, telling me
he came by it from the Clerk of <hi>Crail,</hi> who informed,
that ſeveral ſucceeding Clerks there, have, for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time, engroſt this as a true Copy in their Books,
to preſerve it from utter periſhing, for it is now quite
worn off the ſtone, at leaſt altogether illegible. But be it ſo recorded
in <hi>Crail, Newburgh</hi> or elſewhere, yet with their good favour, ſcarcely
can I judge this a true and exact Copy; whether the fault has lyen in
the firſt Copiator from the ſtone, or from the Engraver, or partly
both: For, none who knows the Hiſtory of <hi>Mackbeth, Malcom Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
and <hi>Mackduff,</hi> will, I hope ſuppoſe, that ſuch a King as <hi>Malcom
Canmore,</hi> when he intended to witneſs a favour for <hi>Mackdaff</hi>'s ſervices,
and ſuch a ſubject as <hi>Mackduff,</hi> when he was willing to publiſh the royal
Bounty of his Maſter, would upon the Croſs of ſo famous a Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
(as this was) have inſcribed but non-ſenſe. And though the true
meaning and purport of the words be dark and abſtruſe to us, who now
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56670:3"/>
live at ſuch a diſtance; yet I wonder why the learned <hi>Skeen</hi> ſhould
brand them as barbarous (I hope he only means unintelligible, and
not nonſenſical) For queſtionleſs they are (for what I have ſaid) ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificative,
and I doubt not but to purpoſe; and moſt probably they
were written, either to ſignifie the Priviledges given by King <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

to <hi>Mackduff,</hi> with the benefits he enjoyed by virtue thereof, or the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
Freedoms and Pardons indulged by, and conferred upon,
that Girth, if not in a complicated ſenſe, all of theſe together. So
then, allowing them to ſignifie ſenſe, which few men in a ſober charity
can well refuſe; lets ſee (as far as we may) to what Language the words
are beſt reducible, for to any ſingle one they cannot: for, albeit the
termination, flexion and conſtruction I take to be moſt after the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
and that there be ſome Latine words intermixed, yet none will
aver it all to be Latine; ſo to ſome other Language we muſt go, which
is but one of two. Our old <hi>High-land</hi> or <hi>Iriſh</hi> tongue, or the <hi>Saxon:</hi>
And as I hardly think it the <hi>High-land</hi> or <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as well, becauſe I never,
heard that brought under <hi>Roman</hi> Terminations, Conſtructions, or
Declinations; So even thoſe that would wreſt it to that Language
in ſome words, cannot follow it out in all, although they be ſeen
in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tongue. And it is ſtrange, none of our <hi>Highlanders,</hi> tho
Scholars ever interprets it; therefore I much rather incline to deduce
it (at leaſt moſt of it) from the <hi>Saxon,</hi> which I hope will not ſeem
ſtrange to the Intelligent when he remembers what footing the <hi>Saxons</hi>
had in this Iſle, and how <hi>Malcome Canmore</hi> was not onely long an
Exile at an <hi>Engliſh Saxon</hi> Court, but that he had intereſt in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,
Cumberland,</hi> and <hi>Weſtmorland,</hi> which was but ſometimes a
Province of the Weſt <hi>Saxons</hi> And as there came 10000 <hi>Engliſh Saxons</hi>
then in with <hi>Sibardus</hi> the Kings Grand-father, ſo they muſt be but No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
in our Language, who do not find <hi>Veſtiges</hi> of the <hi>Saxon</hi> in it

by reaſon of the abundance of Normands therein, became moſt to

Engliſh that came with her, began to ſpeak Engliſh, I underſtand the
Engliſh Saxon, the which language it would ſeem, King <hi>Malcome</hi>

the more affect it; thus far he, where if I might be allowed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
perhaps this Sanctuary was granted at that pious Queens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty,
and here inſcribed with her native tongue for her greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and the rather under a Latine Vizorn, to invite the Scots (of
no language more ſtudious then Latine) to ſome love and knowledge
of the Saxon. And ſo let us now with allowance, to rectifie what
Eſcapes may be in the Orthography, modeſtly examine the Words
themſelves; but leſt I be thought to be too peremptory to impoſe
my naked Conjectures, in a matter of ſuch Antiquity, I ſhall

judged unreaſonable to think theſe Lines, as I got them, might be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
in their Orthography, whether from the miſunderſtanding of
the Saxon Character, if they were ſo ingraved, or (after ſo many
Centuries) even of any other in which it might have been cut, ſince
none who knows any thing, but knows it wants not its own difficulty
to read but the Characters of an Age or two from our ſelves, be
they written in Parchment, or ingraven in Braſs or Stone: as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
I ſhall not ſtick to ſay they be no ſmall Clerks, whom I could

Leave to offer mine, which to the intelligent will not appear very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
from the Coppy I have already here tranſcribed, and the leſs

in whole Syllabications, as in the Lettering, Writing, and

having already been ſo full upon every Word, I hope a cloſs interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

too much to burden the Memory of the Reader, may <hi>I</hi> briefly para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe
it; for a verbatim Expoſition here, as in all the old Tongues (and

<hi>Twiſco</hi> from <hi>Babel</hi>) would ſound a little harſh, as well in reſpect of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56670:8"/>
the idiotiſms of the two languages, as that moſt of the Words are
legal Terms, or relating thereto, and ſo will hardly allow a narrow
and preciſe Expoſition: and although the ground work be Saxon,
yet appears it under a Latine Mask; therefore as I ſaid, I crave pardon
to Paraphraſe it under one View thus,</p>
            <q>Ye Earl of <hi>Fyfe,</hi> receive for your Services, as my Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant

            <p>And thus have I adventured to read and explain this Old Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>quae molta tenet anteiqua ſepolta;</hi> and which, with <hi>Skeen</hi>'s
good Leave, I can no otherwiſe condemn for Barbarous, then that
it is Saxon under a Latine Cover; where it would be remembred, that
after the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> came into <hi>Italy,</hi> the Purity of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Tongue was at a loſs, untill ſomewhat revived in the laſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turie,
and that the Poets about <hi>Malcome Canmore</hi>'s time, were ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
the Prieſts, and thoſe of no great Reading, and for the moſt
part no great and exact Linguiſts, or ſo neat and cloſs in their Poeſie;
as witneſs that Compoſition of the Carmelite Frier's upon the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of <hi>Bannockburn,</hi> ſome hundreds of years after the ſetting up of this
Croſs: And as this was one of, if not the oldeſt Regality in this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56670:9"/>
Countrey, ſo by the Priviledges hereby granted, it will to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
man appear to be very great; whence belike we have that
common Phraſe, <hi>The Kingdom of Fife,</hi> (an Epithet given to no other
Shire) as if <hi>Mackduff</hi> had enjoyed his Eſtate much after the way of
<hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> (or more properly <hi>de Abrincis</hi>) in his Earldom of <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
of whom it is ſaid, he enjoyed that Earldom from his Uncle the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,
<hi>Adeo libere ad gladium, ſicut ipſe Rex tenebat totam</hi> Angliam <hi>ad
Coronam;</hi> and yet I cannot affirm that <hi>Fife</hi> was ever a Palatinate;
But ſure the Priviledges of this Regality and Sanctuary were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more then ordinary. And this our <hi>Mackduffs</hi> poſterity continued
in a line male till the dayes of King <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Bruce:</hi> for one of them
I find Governour of <hi>Perth</hi> for the ſecond <hi>Baliol,</hi> after the Battel of
<hi>Duplin,</hi> for which, whether he was forfaulted, or that his Eſtate and
Honours, through want of iſſue-male, went with a Daughter, <hi>I</hi> cannot
poſitively averr: For, one <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Fife I</hi> find a witneſs in a
Charter, granted by King <hi>David</hi> 2d, to the <hi>Scrimzeour</hi> of <hi>Didupe,</hi> in
the 29. year of his Reign, whom <hi>I</hi> conceive to be that <hi>William Ramſay</hi>
ſaid by <hi>Skeen</hi> to have been made Earl of <hi>Fife</hi> by King <hi>David,</hi> withall
Priviledges, <hi>&amp; cum Lege quae vocatur Clanmackduff,</hi> who might have
married a Daughter of Earl <hi>Duncans,</hi> as well becauſe he got all the old
Priviledges confirmed to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that in the <hi>Scrimzeours</hi> Charter, he is
placed before the Earle of <hi>March; It</hi> not being ſo probable that the
King would have given the priviledges, and precedencie of the old
Earles of <hi>Fyfe</hi> to a new Stranger, if he had not had an intereſt of bloud.
And why ſhould we too raſhly conclude that noble Familie, whoſe
predeceſſors had deſerved ſo well of the Crown, extinct upon a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faultour
for holding the Town of <hi>Perth</hi> for the ſecond <hi>Baliol:</hi> Since our
Hiſtorian ſayes no more, But that he was ſent Priſoner to the Caſtle
of <hi>Kildrummie,</hi> and that he makes him alſo a priſoner to the <hi>Baliol,</hi>
with the Earles of <hi>Murray, Monteth,</hi> and others; who, as he ſayes,
after the battel of <hi>Duplin,</hi> were <hi>Rebus deſperatis coacti jurare in verba
Balioli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither were the <hi>Bruce's</hi> too ſtrick and ſevere in their forefaultours,
(but upon great and ſingular provocations) ſtudying rather to gain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56670:9"/>
and reconcile the Subject by Indemnities, and Oblivions, then to exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
them by too ſharp puniſhments (eſpecially when the <hi>Baliols</hi> had
ſome pretence and ſhadow of Right) But what became of this <hi>William
Ramſay, I</hi> cannot ſay; whether he was forefaulted, or whether through
want of iſſue, the Earledom of <hi>Fyfe</hi> returned to the Crown, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had a daughter who was married to <hi>Robert</hi> the Governour, who
enjoyed the Eſtate and Honours of <hi>Fyfe:</hi> But if as full in its priviledges
as the old <hi>Mackduffs,</hi> or <hi>William Ramſay, I</hi> dare not determine. But
<hi>Skeen</hi> does poſitively tell us, that one <hi>Spence</hi> of <hi>Wormeſton</hi> laid claim to,
and enjoyed the priviledge of the Sanctuarie, upon his killing of one
<hi>Kinninmonth,</hi> as being within the degrees of kindred to <hi>Mackduffe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Earle of <hi>Weems,</hi> and the Laird of <hi>Mackintoſh</hi> ſpeak themſelves
truely deſcended in a line Male from this our <hi>Mackduffe,</hi> by two of his

<hi>I</hi> hope, it ſhall give no offence, though <hi>I</hi> glance at what I have from

to repeat them with my anſwers: which (ſeing I leave every man to

            <p>Firſt then, Was it alledged, That neither <hi>Mackintoſh,</hi> nor <hi>Weems,</hi>

yea, even by a line Male But (not here to debate, whether at that time any
other Surnames, then <hi>Patronymicks,</hi> were fixed to a Family or Progeny)
Can there be a clearer deduction then <hi>Duffe, Mackduffe</hi> (who was

conſequently, before the return of <hi>Malcolm Canmore,</hi> with whom (ſome
ſay) firſt came in as well that order of Honour, as the cuſtomes of our
ſurnames. And ſeing <hi>Weems</hi> was <hi>Mackintoſh</hi>'s Brother, might not he
have been (and if elder ſurely, and even though the younger belike) in
the ſame condition, begot before his father went to <hi>England,</hi> ſeing <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi>

But what if I ſhould ſay, as <hi>Boetius</hi> obſerveth upon the <hi>Stuarts</hi> in a

Yet ſhall I not eſcape without a ſecond Attacque, managed
with I know not what confidence: To wit, That <hi>Mackduffes</hi> race, ſave
in <hi>Mackintoſh</hi> and <hi>Weems,</hi> continued not above a generation or two:
Sure then, has our <hi>Buchanan</hi> exceedingly abuſ'd us; who all alongſt,
even down to the battel of <hi>Duplin,</hi> and the ſiege of <hi>Perth</hi> thereupon,
writes them ſtill <hi>Mackduff;</hi> his words in his ninth book, being, <hi>Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duffus,

before that above-cited place, yet more particularly, <hi>Duncanus Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duffus,
Fifenſis Comes</hi> (with others) <hi>apud Hoſtem captivus.</hi> And as all our
Writers do unanimouſly rank this <hi>Duncan,</hi> the firſt Secular of the ſix
Governours, after the death of K. <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, ſo have I my
ſelf read him, in a letter from the Parliament at <hi>Abirbrothock</hi> to the
Pope, <hi>anno</hi> 1320. Firſt of all named, and ſigning as Earle <hi>Primier</hi> of
the Kingdom, where his ſeal yet appends freſh, four times bigger then
any of the reſt, with the Impreſſe as they Record the Armes in the
books of Herauldrie for the old Earles of <hi>Fyfe,</hi> and as yet they are quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by <hi>Mackintoſh</hi> and <hi>Weems.</hi> But thirdly, it is retorted upon me, that
if the Earle of <hi>Weems,</hi> and Laird of <hi>Mackintoſh,</hi> had been true Cadets
in a line Male, then if the <hi>Mackduff</hi> of <hi>Fyfe</hi> had not been forefaulted,
one or other of them would undoubtedly, as the neareſt Heir Male,
have faln to, and enjoy'd, if not the Eſtate, at leaſt the Honours of <hi>Fyfe.</hi>
But the ſtarters of this doubt, would be pleaſed to remember the ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perineſs
of its grounds; For are not Feudal Tailzies, and ſecluſive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
to Heirs Male, of a far later date with us: And ſo might that
Earledom as well in its Honours, as Fortune, have gone with a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as heir of line) to <hi>William Ramſay,</hi> and by a grand, child to <hi>Robert
Stuart:</hi> Yea, and who well knows in what terms our grants of honour,
(if then in <hi>Malcom Canmor's</hi> dayes conſigned to writ) were conceived,
or if they reached Collaterals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Predeceſſors of the Earle of
<hi>Weems</hi> and Laird of <hi>Mackintoſh,</hi> having come off many generations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Familie failed in the iſſue Male, the Honours might (the
relation being remote) the more readily have been conveyed by a new
