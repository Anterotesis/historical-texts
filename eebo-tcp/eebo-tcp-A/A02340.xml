         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶The Demaunde or questyon.</head>
            <p>WHat is Cyrurgery? The responce or answere. Cyrurgery is scyence that teacheth the maner and qua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lyte to worke / principally in knyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge / in cuttyng / and exercysyng other workes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hande. In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge of man, as moche as it is possyble. And here scyence is put for kynde. And albeit that Cyrurge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry is of it selfe proprely by arte and no scyence / yet for the bonde and affynytie that arte and scyence haue eche with other / somtyme vnproprely that which is arte is called scyence / and that which is scyence is called arte. It is otherwyse sayde (and better) that Cyrurgery is in two maners. One is that sheweth onely so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by it we can do nothynge as touchynge the operacion / and that proprely is called scyence / as we say in physycke that there be .vi. maners of symple appostumes / that is to wyt .iiij. humeralles / one aignous / &amp; the other ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tous. The other maner of cyrurgery is vsaunce / that is to saye / that it teacheth to vse / that he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knoweth it maye helpe hym selfe therwith as many tymes and as often as he wyll as touchyng Cyrurgycall operacions / so that by it he is gouerned and ruled whan he wyll vse it / as by the Cyrurgery that he hath in his vnderstandynge / that teacheth hym that in all hote appostumes he oughte to put and laye to it repercutyues / saufe vnto them that ben in the sumuytones / and to such as be venymous / 
<pb facs="tcp:6227:3"/>
This Cyrurgery or arte that thou haste in thyne vnderstandynge / teacheth the to worke &amp; vse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in medecynes / and is proprely called arte and nat scyence. And in the ende of thy dyffynicion besyde the particulers that are put for differences that are set vnto that whiche is possyble / for it is nat possyble to all Cyrurgyens to heale all theym that are dyseased and sore. ¶Demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. In what case oughte a Cyrurgyen to vse very cure? And in what cases is he permytted to vse onely palliatiue cures. Answere. In all cases ought he to vse very cure / excepte in thre cases / where as alonely he is permitted the cure palliatyue. The fyrste is whan the disease of them selfes are vncurable as lazary. The seconde for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inobedyence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pacient to suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fre the paynes that he ought / bycause his myght can nat suffre it / as is the Canker in a pertyculer me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre. The thyrde / yf by the cure of such a disease there foloweth a greater inconuenyent / as in to euyll inueterate sores / or in to olde emeroides / yf there be nat alway lefte an yssue there as any dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger is / for drede to fall in to ydropsy or manyake / as Ipocras sayth in his Aphorysmes. ¶Demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de. Wherof is named Cyrurgery? Answere. It is so named of chyr / that is a hande / and of Gow / that is operacion / for it is a scyence that teacheth to worke by hande y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is manually. ¶Demaunde. What is the subiect of cyrurgery? Answere. The subiecte of Cyrurgery is the body of man that is diseased &amp; sore able to be healed, for it is therabout
<pb facs="tcp:6227:3"/>
that the Cyrurgyen worketh. ¶Demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. what is theffecte of Cyrurgery? Answere. Theffect ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of is to take away the dysease of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes body / and to kepe it in healthe as moche as it is possyble.</p>
            <p>¶Demaunde. In howe many kyndes or partyes is Cyrurgery deuysed? Answere. Ioha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nyce sayeth that generally it is deuysed in two, that is to wyt to worke in soft membres / as in the flesshe. And to worke in the harde me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres as the bones. And par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyculerly Cyrurgery is deuyded in .v. That is to wit to worke in wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des / in appostumes / in sores / and in restoracyons / and in other thynges belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynge to handy operacyon. ¶Demaunde. What dyuers operacions exerciseth the Cyrurgyen? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. In thre dyuers operacions. That is to wyt dysolue the thynge contynued / knyt the thynge se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perated / and put out the superflue thynge. To dys<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solue the thynge contynued is by incysynge / cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge / or scaturysyng. To reioyne the seperate as in consolydynge the woundes and redusynge the lyppes. And to put out the superflue thinges, as in curyng appostumes to clense them and put away the coores. ¶Demaunde. Howe many and what yrens ought a Cyrurgyen to bere in his case with hym? Answere. He oughte to haue .v. as Cysers / Nyppers / Launcettes / Rasoures / and Nedelles. ¶Demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. Howe many and what oyntementꝭ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly oughte the Cyrurgyen bere with hym? Answere .v. That is to wyt / an oyntement Basy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycon for to rype / Apostolorum to clense / Aureum
<pb facs="tcp:6227:4"/>
to encrease flesshe. And the whyte oyntement for to drye and bynde. And de Althea for to sowple.</p>
            <p>¶Demaunde. Of howe many thyngꝭ / and what thynges the Cyrurgyen taketh his entencions for to heale sore folkes? Answere. That after Galyen in his terapentyc they ben taken of thre thynges. That is of thynges agaynst nature / of naturall thynges / and of vnnaturall thynges / and also of theyr annexes. And fyrste he taketh this indyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon of thynges agaynst nature / that is to wyt to the knowledge of the malady in his nature after Galyen in the seconde of his terapentic. And than come vnto the naturalles / and after to the vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalles and theyr annexes. And so after his indy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacyons taken he ought to procede to the healyng of the pacyent in all that may lye in hym possyble. And let the Cyrurgyen note that it is sayde / in all that may lye possyble in hym / bycause it is nat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way possyble. And with what thynges, and howe. For as galyen sayth towarde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende of his thyrde boke / and in the seauenth of his sayd terapentyc / <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:6227:4"/>
remayne) in suche case he ought to begyn his cure at the moste daungerous / &amp; where there is moste peryll in the remaynynge of it / and oftentymes more sooner in the accydentes that happeneth in a sore / then in the sore selfe.

But for one generall intencyon / and for .xi. partyculers. The intencyon general is for to drawe, and the particulers do vary after the places that they be applyed to. The fyrste place is vpon the ypocondres to reduce &amp; dyuert the blode of the nosethrylles after Galyen in the fyfth of his Terapentyke sayenge that whan the ryght nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thryll doth blede, for to staunche it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ventose must be applyed vpon the lyuer / and whan one bledeth at the left nosethryll it must be applyed on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mylt.

The thyrde place where they ought to be applyed is on the interyour parte of the heade for to reyse the euela / &amp; to staunche the rewme. For to drawe the depe mater outwarde as Galyen declareth in the xiij. boke of his Terapentycke / and for that cause they be often applyed vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> appostumes that be in the clensyng places / the which Auycen hyddeth to be drawen out as moche as maye be. Lykewyse they be applyed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same cause vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thyghes / 
<pb facs="tcp:6227:53"/>
for to prouoke floures in women. And also nyghe to the appostumes of the ioyntes / to w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drawe &amp; deffende that the sayde appostumes do nat brede / and to put ferof the humours fro y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayde ioyntes. The fourth place to apply them is vpon the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of synewes, in palsy, for to heat them as Auy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cen sayeth in the thyrde boke of his Canon in the Chaptour of palsy.

The fyfth place to apply ventoses is vpon the bely in colyke passyon, for to resolue and vnuapen the ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tosire, and cease the payne. The .vj. place is vpon the matryce, and vpon the bowelles for to reduce and withdrawe them to theyr places, as Auycen sayth in his thyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de canon. The .vij. place is vpon the rybbes &amp; lyke bones for to reduce and retourne them in to theyr places, whan they are broken or dysioynted. The. viij. place is vpon the wayes and poores wherby the vryne passeth from the reynes to the bladder / as Auycen sayth in the thyrde boke of his Canon. The .ix. place is vpon the eares &amp; gappes of depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> woundes, for to drawe out the fylth or other noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce yf there were any. The .x. place is vpon the necke for to enlarge the wayes of the breth and of the meate. The .xj. place to apply ventoses is vpon venymous bytyngꝭ and blaynes to drawe out the thycke venym. ¶Demaunde. Howe ought they to gouerned that must be ventosed before &amp; after it?
<pb facs="tcp:6227:53"/>
Answere. To the fyrste answereth Galyen in the thyrde boke of the cretyke dayes, and the same pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth Albumazer i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his great introductory that the chosen dayes for to applye ventoses is whan the moone is ful &amp; nat in the wane. For as the moone encreaseth in lyghte / lykewyse encreaseth the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours within the body / and as it waneth so des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humours &amp; withdrawe them inwarde. And therwith it ought to be an australl day / that is to say hote and moyste / and the ventoses ought to be plyed fro two of the clocke vnto thre. And af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intencyons of doctours / fyrste y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place ought to be bathed and fomented (whiche shulde be ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosed) with warme water yf the blode be thycke / but yf it be thynne it is nat nede at all, for it shuld be daunger of to moche resolucyon / and that the strength shuld weyken. And it is to note / that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer scaryfieng ought to be made but fyrst ye must put to the ventose drye, bycause the blode must be drawen or it be voyded. As to the seconde question it is to be noted as is afore spoken that there be two maners of ventoses. Some be of horne / and some of glas. They of horne are applied in suckyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge. They of glas with towe put in to the ventose / and fyre in the twoe and layde on the flesshe / than the fyre quencheth where the ventose taketh. Or after Albucrasis / take a lytell candell of waxe and gyue it a lytel stey belowe that it may holde ryght vpon the flesshe, and lyght it, than set on the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tose, and the candell wyll quenche and the ventose

take holde. And the Cyrurgyen oughte with his handes to rubbe all aboute the place to moue the blode to it. As to the thyrde questyon after that ye haue applyed and set to the said ventose by two or thre tymes yf it be nede whan it is taken away ye ought to make certayne scaryfycacyons very depe with the rasour / and than wype and drye the blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy place / and than ones agayne set to the ventose as ye dyd before / and kepe it on halfe an houre tyll it be halfe full of blode, and then take it away and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the case is such that I haue no sygne wherby I do vnderstande that the body is hurte of a scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyon.

Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if the things therein conteyned be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly and wisely studied and applied, according to the true meaning of the Author, we haue to tell you hereof, that therein is great perrill, because through ignorant practitioners, not knowing the Anatomie, commonly doth ensue death, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of soule and bodie. Furthermore, whereas many good and learned men in these our daies, do cease to publish abroade in the English tongue</p>
