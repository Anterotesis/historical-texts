            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Abſtract of the Preſent State
OF THE
Proteſtants in France.</head>
            <p>HIS Majeſtie having earneſtly recommended
the calamitous condition of the French
Proteſtants, to the Charity of his Subjects;
it will be reaſonable that ſome account
ſhould be given of the Perſecution and Severities
uſed towards thoſe unhappy People, which have
driven them from their Eſtates and Country, and
cauſed them in ſo great numbers to ſeek for refuge
amongſt Strangers.</p>
            <p>The aforeſaid preſſures are of two ſorts; one
from <hi>the iniquity of the Laws,</hi> the other from <hi>the
violence of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt, Whereas the Proteſtants of
<hi>France,</hi> as a reward for their eminent Services
to the Government and Crown; were ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the memorable <hi>Edict of Nantes</hi> bearing date
<hi>April</hi> 1598. ratified thro the ſucceſſion of ſeveral
Kings, and in particular by him who now reigns:
yet of late without any pretence of forfeiture, or
ill demerit on their part, they have been ſubjected
to many ſeverities directly contrary to the conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the ſaid Edict; and indeed that humanity
which is due to all Men, even from Heathen Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and profeſſed Enemies.</p>
            <p>An inſtance whereof will be <hi>firſt,</hi> the Edict of <hi>Feb.</hi>
28. 1680. whereby, in imitation of the Egyptians
dealing with the Iſraelites, it is ordered, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Women ſhall not be delivered in Child-birth, but
by Midwives and Surgeons who are Papiſts;</hi> and they
are commanded to <hi>Baptize the Children new born,</hi>
who are thenceforth eſteemed to be members of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and if when they come to
age they ſhall profeſs the Proteſtant Religion, will
be liable to be puniſht as Apoſtates, and their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
obnoxious for perverting them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The Edict of <hi>June</hi> 17. 1681. whereby it is
ordered <hi>that the Children of Proteſtants ſhall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to abjure the Religion of their Parents, as ſoon as
they ſhall attain the age of ſeven Years:</hi> And it is then
put into the choice of the Children whether they
will continue with them, and be there maintain'd
with large allowances ſuch as the Papiſt Magiſtrate
ſhall appoint; or have the like proviſion made at
the charge of the Parents elſewhere. By which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of licence the Children are not only encourag'd
to diſobedience and debauchery; but rendred the
Maſters, nay Perſecutors of their Parents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> The Edict of <hi>Novem.</hi> 19. 1680. which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains
that <hi>when any Proteſtant ſhall happen to be ſick,
he ſhall ſuffer himſelf to be viſited</hi> by the Papiſt Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Prieſts; who at their coming remove
from him his Friends, Relations and Attendants,
and among themſelves interrogate him according
to their pleaſure; and his anſwers are uſually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
to be a reconciliation of himſelf to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
and an abjuring of the Proteſtant Religion:
So that if he die, the Family are eſteem'd the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of a <hi>Papiſt Father,</hi> and ſo to be bred in that
Religion: If he ſurvives and continues in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, he is to be treated as a <hi>relapſed
Heretic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> The Edicts of July 9. &amp; 31. 1681. which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
<hi>the Proteſtants from having Schoolmaſters to
teach their Children who are of their Religion,</hi> more
than bearly <hi>to Write</hi> and <hi>Read:</hi> and only <hi>one is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in a whole City:</hi> and beſides this <hi>they only
may teach who are licenc'd by Papiſt Officers:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
alſo their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities are ſuppreſt:</hi> which was the
very courſe formerly taken by <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate
for the extirpating of Chriſtianity; And was the
method of the Ammonites, to put out <hi>the right
eyes of the Iſraelites, as a reproach</hi> upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> The Edicts of Novem. 6. 1679. Jun. 11. Aug.
17. 1680, and June 28. 1681. which order the <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Proteſtants out of civil and military employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the diſabling trades-men from keeping ſhops
or exerciſing their Profeſſions.</hi> Which is in effect to
command them and their families to ſteal or be
ſtarv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> The Edict of Nov. 19. 1680. which <hi>Grants
to all Proteſtants who change their Religion, a reſpit
for three years of paying their depts,</hi> laying a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
upon their creditors <hi>to bring any action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them:</hi> Which as it is a violent temptation
to ill men to change their Religion, ſo it abſolut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruins the credit of others, who are no longer
truſted, the Creditor being inſecure of being
paid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> The Edict of June 1680. which orders that
<hi>no ſubject of France of what quality, condition, age or
ſex ſoever, now making profeſſion of the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
may ever forſake it to go over to the Reformed,
for what cauſe, reaſon, pretence, or conſideration
ſoever: And whoſoever ſhall act to the contrary ſhall
be condemned to make</hi> Amendehonourable, <hi>to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
baniſhment, and confiſcation of goods. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
all Miniſters of the Reform'd Religion are forbid
to receive any Proſelyte coming to them from</hi> Popery,
<hi>or ſuffer in their Churches or Aſſemblies any ſuch, under
penalty that the Miniſter ſhall be depriv'd from ever
exerciſing his function, and of the ſuppreſſion of the
Place or Church for ever after.</hi> Upon which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and others as unreaſonable. (for how is it
poſſible for any Congregation to provide that no
perſon formerly of another perſwaſion, ſhould
come among them:) an <hi>almoſt infinite number of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102019:2"/>
Churches have bin demoliſh'd.</hi> They are the words
of the provincial Aſſembly of the province of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
held in the months of March and May 1681.
alledg'd as a teſtimony of the piety of the King.
So that at this preſent, the Proteſtants are fain to
go to many places 30. or 40. Miles, to get their
Children Baptiz'd, or perform any public act of
religious worſhip. And if it happen in caſe of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
Children to be Baptiz'd, that the Papiſt mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
hath done that office before, then the Parent
is accuſed as Sacrilegious; and of rebaptizing a
Catholic Infant into hereſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>8ly.</hi> But ſince mention is made of <hi>Amendehonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
as a part of the puniſhment of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
to the reformed Religion, it may not be
amiſs to give ſome account of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>9ly.</hi> The perſon condemn'd to this puniſhment is
to go into ſome public place in his Shirt, with a
Torch in his hand, and a Rope about his neck,
followed by the common Hangman; and in this
equipage, as if he were the moſt Infamous Malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
he is to ask pardon of God, the King and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
for what he has done. That is for leaving a
Religion which he believed to be Heretical, and
Idolatrous; and for imbracing the truth, and
deſiring to ſave his ſoul, he is to be made a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to God, Angels, and Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>10ly.</hi> But over and above all this <hi>ſeverity of the
Laws;</hi> there is added, the <hi>cruelty of Magiſtrates,</hi>
and <hi>violence of Souldiers.</hi> Againſt a proteſtant,
any accuſation is greedily received, and ſeverely
proſecuted; and if after long vexation, expence
and impriſonment, the innocence of the Perſon
accus'd ſhall be ſo manifeſt as not to be diſſembled,
he can hope for no reparation againſt the Papiſt
falſe accuſer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>11ly.</hi> Nor is the condition of the Proteſtants in
<hi>civil cauſes</hi> better than in <hi>criminal.</hi> If any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſues a Papiſt for the Intereſt of an eſtate, or
debt: or complains of being over-rated in Taxes;
whereas he ſhould be heard in ſeveral parts of
France, according to the Edict of <hi>Nantes;</hi> by
<hi>Chambres Miparties,</hi> where are Counſellors and
Judges who are Proteſtants as well as Papiſts;
now they are entirely expoſed to their mortal and
profeſt enemies, and what the ſuceſs of ſuch trials
is likely to be, twill be needleſs to declare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>12ly.</hi> But as if this hardſhip were not enough;
in thoſe Countries where Proteſtants moſt abound,
Souldiers are ſent among them to live at free quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
call'd by them <hi>diſcretion,</hi> and do that executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and barbarity, which they have practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
conquer'd enemies. Where what they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
devour, or make advantage of by ſale, they
ſpoil and trample under feet: Beat with cudgels
the men, clap ſwords and piſtols to their breaſts;
abuſe and raviſh the women: and when they have
pillagd their houſes, tie the Poſſeſſors to their horſe
tails, and drag them to Maſs: where having
thrown holy water into their faces, they ſay they
are Catholics; and if thy diſown it, ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
againſt as <hi>Relapſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>13ly.</hi> When Perſons weary of this uſage, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to fly into forreign parts, being diſcoverd
they are clapt into priſons and dungeons, there to
be ſtarv'd to death, or periſh by noiſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes:
And thoſe miſerable Perſons who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to bear theſe Extremities renounce their
Religion, are at the ſame time forc'd to give
it under their hands that they have abjur'd
<hi>without conſtraint, and of their own free choice.</hi>
And all this uſage is ſtill pretended to be, <hi>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and innocent means made uſe of, to bring Heretics
to the boſome of the Church, becoming the bounty and
goodneſs of the King, and conformable to the mind of
the Divine Paſtor, who alwayes retains bowels of mercy
for theſe ſtrayed Sheep; and wills they ſhould be brought
back, and not hunted away, becauſe he deſires their
Salvation and regrets their loſs. Which conduct is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
far from the rigor wherewith the Catholiks are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Neighbouring Kingdoms which are infected
with Hereſy; by which it appears, what difference there
is between Reaſon and Paſſion, between the meekneſs of
Truth, and rage of Impoſture, between the Zeal of the
Houſe of</hi> God, <hi>and the fury of Babylon.</hi> They
are the words of the Biſhop of <hi>Claudiopolis,</hi> to the
King, in the head of the Deputies of the Clergy of
<hi>France,</hi> and are intended as a reproach to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>England</hi> and the Government thereof.</p>
            <p>And may not now the deſolate Church of <hi>France</hi>
take up her Lamentation and ſay? <hi>Is it nothing to
you all ye that paſs by, behold and ſee, if there be any
Sorrow like unto my Sorrow which is done unto me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Lord hath afflicted me, in the day of his fierce
Anger.</hi> Lam. 1. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Bleſſed are the Merciful for they ſhall obtain
Mercy. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
            <p>Let Brotherly love continue. Be not forgetful to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
Strangers: for thereby ſome have entertain'd
Angels unawares. Remember them that are in bonds, as
bound with them, and them which ſuffer adverſity, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your ſelves in the body. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>When the Son of Man ſhall come in his Glory and all
the Holy Angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the
Throne of his Glory. And before him ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
all Nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from
another, as a Shepherd divideth the Sheep from the
Goats; and he ſhall ſet the Sheep on his Right Hand, but
the Goats on the Left. Then ſhall the King ſay unto
them on his Right Hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father
inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World. For I was an hungred and ye gave
me Meat, I was thirſty and ye gave me Drink: I was
a Stranger and ye took me in: Naked and ye Clothed
me, I was ſick and ye viſited me, I was in Priſon and
ye came unto me, <hi>&amp;c. Matth. 25. 31. &amp;c.</hi>
