            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There is no such schoole as yours, to teach the conquest of corruption and iniustice; which euery man must first subdue, before hee conquer their conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.

houses; are so many defiances, which Death sends to mortall men, to summon them to the Combat. All men must vndergoe it, of necessitie, no man can free himselfe by flight; there is onely one remedie which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it selfe vnto vs, that speedily and without delay wee make a fayned Combat against death, to haue some happy presage of victory: As</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>the Great did, from a duell performed at pleasure, conceiuing that he should get the victory of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius; <hi>for that the souldier which acted his person did vanquish him of</hi> Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. <hi>In like sort let vs trie; at the least this triall will teach vs what wee can d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e, or rather what wee cannot; to the end that after the knowledge thereof, we may haue recourse to him who makes perfect his power in our weakenesse; to the Eternall, who alone can rescue vs out of the pawes of death. Hee will teach vs moreouer, how much many are to be blamed at this day, which liue in the light of the Sunne of Iustice, to bee so fearefull at the time of death, when as poore
<pb facs="tcp:3718:6"/>
Pagans were so resolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you will say vnto mee, What doctrine can wee expect from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans? by whom mans life is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed but ruined, as saith</hi> Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius; <hi>and who are the Patriarkes of Heretickes, as</hi> Tertullian <hi>doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. I answere, that if wee had put on Christ after the perfect stature of a Christian man, this labour were in vaine: But for this we may not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemne all humane Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, but the truth which it hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, must be pulled away as from an vniust detayner, saith S.</hi> Augustine. <hi>Moreouer, long since the maximes of</hi> Aristotle <hi>and other Philosophers, were allowed in the schoole of Christ, namely, in that which concernes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, in which ranke natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death is Humane Philosophie in so much as she hath yeelded herselfe a seruant to diuine truth, hath not beene reiected but imbraced of the first &amp; most cleere sighted fathers; of</hi> Lactantius <hi>I say, who hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that Philosophie doth not hurt when as the spirit is seasoned with
<pb facs="tcp:3718:7"/>
religion: Of</hi> Clemens Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, <hi>who saith learnedly, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Doctrine of our Sauiour be of it selfe sufficient, seeing it is the power and wisedome of God; yet by the doctrine of the Grecians, if it bee not more fortified, it is yet vnable to repell the insulting of Sophisters, and to discouer their ambushes; It is the bedge and rampar of the Lords vine. These great spirits, (saith he, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place) being free from passions, are accustomed to ayme point blanke and hit the marko of trueth: Thus he speakes, and therefore</hi> Lipsius <hi>did not forbeare to call it the meanes</hi>

The plague of the soules, the damned doctrine of her death, is propounded and refuted by sollide reasons, who will repine at it? The second is taken from the thing it selfe, which is, the immortalitie of the soule. Truth will not be flattered nor disguised, shee contents her selfe with her owne constancie, and her naturall Ornaments; shee is like the Palme tree which the more it is prest downe, the higher it growes: It is like gold, the more it is tried the brighter it shines.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3718:13"/>
to enter into that shippe which alone can bring vs thither, were to mocke at himselfe. Let vs proceed and come to the proofe of the 2. proposition, for thereon is grownded the force of our Syllogisme: That Death is the onely meanes to attaine vnto the perfection of life, is manifest, in that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of euery thing is the enioying of the ends; all the lines of our dessignes, all the proiects of our enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, all our sweating and toyle tend, and aime at the end.</p>

This life is a very way, as soone as thou doest enter into it, and makest but one step, it is the first pace towards the end of the way, towards the end of life, which is death: for the going out of the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is the beginning of the entry to the graue, whether

<q>
                     <l>Death hath degrees, yet that is not the first,</l>

why that wise <hi>Tekohite</hi> sayd vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> in the present <note place="margin">2. Sam. 2, 14.</note> time: For certaine we die, and slide away as the waters which returne no more. So many degrees as there are in life, so many deaths, so many beginnings of another life: Let vs examine them, and take speciall note of the first death, to iudge of the latter; for herein as in all the other workes of wise Nature, the end is answerable to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
               <p>The first degree of mans life is, when being fashioned and framed, hee liues in the wombe of his mother; this is a vegetatiue life, a life proper to plants only, wherein hee may receiue nourishment &amp; grow; in this life he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues commonly but nine
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3718:15"/>
moneths, at the end of which time hee dies, but a happy death whereby he gaines the vse of the goodly sences of nature, that is to say, of sight, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching: behold then the first death when as the Infant by the force of nature is driuen out of that fleshie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, comming from which place he striues and stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out himselfe; hee is angry with nature, and cries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly, but he is ill aduised; it is his good, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his perfection. Now followeth the infantiue life, not differing from that of beasts, which extends vnto seuen yeares compleate; of this life child-hood is the death, which begins at eight yeares, and retaines nothing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3718:16"/>
of the Infancy. As for the exterior of man, which is the body, not the flesh, nor bones; not the foure principall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, if that bee true which the Phisitions hold for a Maxime, that our bodies change all their substance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery seuen yeares. And in truth how could our sliding nature so long subsist? if it were not maintained by drinke and meate, the which by a certaine vertue infused into all the members of the body, digested, purged, and applied, doth transubstantiat it selfe into our very bodies proportionably as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance decayes: as appeares by the words in the booke of Wisedome, cap. 5. Being borne wee suddenly desist from that being wherein wee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3718:16"/>
were borne. It is no more the first body which wee brought into the world, that is dead; wee haue an other in our child-hood the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of life, which extends vnto 18. yeares, at the end wherof his death encounters him; in the which beginnes the 4. degree of life, which goes vnto 22. and then dies: but from this death riseth youth, the 5. degree which florisheth vnto 30. yeares, &amp; then his flower falls and his youth is lost; but a rich losse, seeing, thereby man-hood the perfect age is gotten, which being strong and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous climbes vnto 50. yeares, and this is the 6. degree of life. Then comes age the 7. degree of life, and the death of man-hood, at what time
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3718:17"/>
the spirit is fortified, and growes more ripe in good Counsell, and wiser in his actions; this life ascends vnto the decrepit age as they call it, which begins at 70. yeares, where rests the death of age, and so runnes on vnto the graue all the remainder of his life: and this is the 8. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of life. In the end suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in his turne the last, principall, and most to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired death; I say the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, for that it makes an end of all the other deathes that went before, and feares no more the miseries of life: I say to be desired; for she alone doth crowne the actions of mortal life with glorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality; it is the hand which sets vpon our heads the flourishing Diadem of

eternall life.</p>

Poore man thou tremblest at the shadow of death, thou doest crie and howle when she layes hold on thee, euen so thou diddest when thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers strength cast thee out of her wombe: if then thou haddest had thy iudgement neate as now thou hast, thou wouldest haue held thy selfe happy to haue left a most fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy prison within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite

of that round Citty: In like sort if now, thou hadst thy vnderstanding and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 2.</note> transformed and renewed (as the Apostle speakes) thou shouldest see plainely that what doth terrifie thee, is that which should assure thee.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Epist. 24. &amp; 103.</note> vnto thee, who had but the eyes of a man, and consider what he sayth; thou shalt find that in it are no ambushes nor constraint, it is onely pure and simple nature, which speakes by reason; it is an vndoubted <hi>Maxime,</hi> that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alwayes tends and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines for the most part to the perfection of her worke.

Man is her Master peece, all other Creatures are made for him, the perfection of man is his perpetuity in a most happy life, nature leads man by degrees to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

Answer. I said not that death was the finall cause of life, but the way; yea, the onely
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3718:20"/>
way which leades vs vnto it, and that for the loue of that great and foueraigne good, which is ioyning to the gate of death, we should desire it, and not bee amazed at it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of S. <hi>Paule,</hi> who writing to the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians,</hi> desired to be dissolued, <note place="margin">c. 1. v. 23.</note> and to be with Christ, the which was farre better for him, that he might bee crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a crowne of Iustice, <note place="margin">2.

Thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest ascend ioyfully, so must come downe againe with the like content, if in the last steppe or in the midst thou beest not carried away acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially by some violent death; but to returne to the place where thou hast beene taken, thy nature doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort thee, yea it forceth thee.

                  <p>But who doth not see that it is not properly death which causeth this inclination to pietie, but the iudgement of God, which wee discerne through death as through a glasse? that it is the worme of Conscience which doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken vs by the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Death, and stirres vp sinners to iustice &amp; sanctitie?

spinne it out till such a time, they will doe it, feare it not: and in the danger of death, will rather shew a miracle to preserue thee, as to the Poet <hi>Simonides,</hi> who supping with <hi>Scopas,</hi> in a Towne of <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,</hi> word was brought him, that two young men were at the dore to speake with him: the Poet went forth, but found no body at the doore, but hee heard a great noyse of the chamber which sunke downe, and smothered <hi>Scopas</hi> and al his guests in the ruins.</p>
               <p>We reade that <hi>Gelon</hi> then a young Infant, but appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to liue longer, to gouern <hi>Sicile,</hi> was drawne out of the like, but a stranger danger: for as hee was at schoole in the presence of his master and many of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3718:44"/>
behold, a great Wolfe enters into the school, comes to <hi>Gelon,</hi> layes hold of his booke, and drawes it by the one end: <hi>Gelon</hi> without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement holds fast, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffers himselfe to bee drawne forth by the Woolfe then to let goe his hold; and in the meane time the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding happened to sinke, and ouerwhelmed both Master and schollers.</p>
               <p>Thus God shewes his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, preseruing by his Angels those whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from present and most eminent dangers.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3718:44"/>
that the Angell executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, to shew the force of prouidence, told <hi>Lot,</hi> that he could not doe any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee were retired into a towne adioyning, which was afterwards called <hi>Zohar;</hi> into the which he was no sooner entred, but the Eternall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red downe fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone vpon <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We reade of <hi>Titus Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> that two famous knights had conspired to kill him, whereof he was aduertised; but making no shew thereof, he tooke them by the hands, led them forth to walke, and hauing called for two swords he gaue to eyther of them one, as prouoking them to that which they had resolued but being amazed both of

the manner and of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours courage. You see (sayth he) that destinie doth iustly hold the principalitie of the world, and that in vaine men practise murthers against it, be it through hope to purchase greatnesse, or for feare to lose it.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it is not of vs, but of the word of destinie, which God hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the lengthening, or shortning of our liues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.

pursued by the Iudgement of God, as he often cried out <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 13.</note> that his punishment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable, and therefore hee should wander vpon the face of the earth, and that whosoeuer should finde him would kill him: but God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, setting a brand vpon his fore-head, to the end no man should slay him.

Answere, I denie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of the maior, for that the position of the first and principall cause, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not the remotion of the instrumentall: the reason is, that God to bring to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his decrees, would also haue the second meanes and causes imployed; hee doth witnesse it in his word, and in the gouernement of the world, and he hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to vse them.

                     </gap> grace and vertue which casts vs into diseases. It is finally hee, who is the powerfull and soueraigne arbitrator of the length or shortnesse of our life: The reason is, that God who by his absolute will and pleasure hath predestinated these ends, hath withall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the meanes and wayes tending to the said ends; so as it appeareth, it is not our intention to take from man all care of his life, but onely to put away the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie, the immoderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3718:57"/>
and particularly the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame feare of death, for that it is vnprofitable, yea, hurtfull vnto him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a wise man will willingly obey the aduertisement of S. <hi>Basile,</hi> which he directs to all Christians: Submit thy selfe, saith he, to the will of God; if thou doest march freely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, it will guide thee; if thou goest backe thou doest offend it, and yet she will not leaue thee, to draw thee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoeuer she pleaseth.</p>
                  <p>Be it the place, the time, or the kinde of thy death, these three things are vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto thee, &amp; out of thy disposition; &amp; therefore thou shouldest rely vpon him who <note place="margin">Eccles. 3. 2.

                  <p>It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the liuing God. Moreouer, it is an vnspeakeable paine to be burnt with the sore, to bee strangled with the plague, &amp;c. Thirdly, it is a sorrow which exceeds all extreames, to bee abandoned of wife, Father, mother, children, friends, and kinsfolkes. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is a perpetuall griefe to die, and haue no meanes to settle his estate.</p>
                  <p>Answer. These reasons are but goodly shewes to shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow the feare they haue of death, and the shame which lies lurking in their hearts;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3718:60"/>
for seeing they must leaue this life, what doth it import them, whether it be by water, or by land, or by any other, meanes? As for the first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Dauid</hi> wil answere for vs, that we must not iudge rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the poore man in his torment: His son will adde, that none can discerne whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be worthy of loue or hatred by that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens exteriorly: The Apostle will say, The iudgements of God beginne by his owne house: <hi>Iob,</hi> the Apostles, the Martyrs will manifest by their examples, that they whom God loues are most chastized in this world.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Iesus Christ will teach vs, That in the blind man so borne, neither his <note place="margin">Iohn 9.</note> sinne, nor the sinne of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3718:60"/>
and mother, was the cause that hee was borne blind: that neither the <hi>Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> so cruelly intreated by <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> nor the <hi>Iewes</hi> smothered in the ruines of the Tower which was in <hi>Silo,</hi> were more guilty then those which had escaped this disaster. A faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man is not tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his strength, if afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on abounds, consolation will superabound. He dies happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which layes downe his soule with a setled spirit, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in himselfe the peace &amp; grace of God through Iesus Christ, in the remission of his sinnes. And it is a thousand times better to be quickned by the light affliction of the plague, and to carry away an inestimable weight of glory, then to be smothered in the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3718:61"/>
delights of sinne, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a finall ruine both of body and soule.</p>
                  <p>The example produced of <hi>Dauid</hi> makes for this against the Obiector. Who sinned? <hi>Dauid</hi> in ambitiously num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his people: who is puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed? the people: the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are plagued for the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <note place="margin">Horat Quicquid dearant Reges, &amp;c.</note> resolutions of their Kings, sayd the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe. But where is the duty of Iustice, will you say? God knowes it; his will is the rule of equitie, it is iust seeing God will haue it so: And on the other side, it was not the wil of God for that it is not right. But we commonly see that the plague layes hold of the poorer sort (whereupon <hi>Galen</hi> calls it <hi>Epidemique,</hi> that is to say, popular; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3718:61"/>
the baites are famine, slut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishnesse and stinkes,) rather then the chiefe of the Towne infected, who notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be found much more faulty before God.</p>
                  <p>Looke vpon that long plague which vnder the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Gallus,</hi> and <hi>Volusian</hi> continued 15. whole yeares, and which comming out of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> vnpeopled all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> prouinces; reade it and <note place="margin">Zonaras Tom. 2.</note> iudge of it.</p>
                  <p>As for that pretended paine, wee must not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it to be greater then in simple swellings and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumes, or in Cauteries; the poison rather mollifying then increasing the paine.

as the spirits onely are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a venemous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious ayre, which hath bin suckt in by the mouth, or the nose, or that hath gotten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly into the body by the pores of the skinne, so as a man shal be stroken that shal not feele any thing: it may be, he shall be more faint and heauy then of custome, but with very little heate and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration; so as hee shall bee sometimes smothered vp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he feeles any paine. The other is a compound, when as the Contagion seazing the spirits, doth communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his poyson with the foure humours, infects them, and alters them, but without paine, for these humours are incapable: yet these humours beeing infected and altered,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3718:62"/>
infect and alter the parts of the body, in the which they reside, as in the head, the heart, and elsewhere; and there growes the paine, but no greater then in Feauers and swoundings; yea, lesse by reason of the putrid vapour, which doth dull and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the members, so as the paine is no more then a small incision; yea, lesse then the pricking of a pinne. The greatest is a certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation in the hypocon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driake parts, in the bowells which enuiron the heart: for as poyson is the capitall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of life, so this enemy of life strikes furiously at the heart. The worst is a certaine heate whereof the Patient complaines: as <hi>Thucidides</hi> obserues in the plague which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3718:63"/>
happened at <hi>Athens,</hi> but what paine in this heat, that is not greater in the burning of a little finger, or in a Tertian Ague? But if your opinion will not yeelde to these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, inquire of them which haue beene toucht with this infection; they will answer that feare hath beene their greatest paine, and if they had been assured of recouery, they had felt no paine. I know you will reply, that there is a difference betwixt them that recouer, and them that die. But I will answer you, that the paine is equall, yea grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them that recouer, then in them that dye: they that recouer are more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and the vicious humour stings them, and is more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible then in them that are
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3718:63"/>
weaker, when the parts lesse able to resist, are sooner got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and lost. As a Leper, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his flesh infected with Leprosie and rottennesse, feeles little or no paine, in the most sensible pricking: euen so a weake woman hath lesse torment in her deliuerie, although the throwes bee more dangerous; wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares the admirable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Nature, which doth not afflict the afflicted.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth the third reason obiected, the abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of wife, kinsfolkes, and friends. <hi>Answer.</hi> It is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which happens sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or not at all this day: hardly can that which life hath vnited by marriage, consanguinity and friendship be dissolued in death. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3718:64"/>
a wise man, who should haue learned to bee content <note place="margin">Plato 3. de Repub.</note> with himselfe in life, should not be discontented if he die alone. It was a constant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinein the resolute Stoicks, that he is happy that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with himselfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not vpon any other man, nor vpon any thing in the world; but like <hi>Iupiter,</hi> liues and moues of himselfe, rests in himselfe, gouernes himself, &amp; enioies his worthy thoughts, as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith. And how can hee bee happy, who (beeing subiect to anothers <note place="margin">Epist. 9.</note> command) is not master of himselfe? Let him drag after him fetters of gold, yet hee shall stil be in fetters. We wil not heere commend the <hi>Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons, Timons,</hi> and other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which like wolues,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3718:64"/>
fled from all company; but those that offering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to company, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their friendship, are wretchedly chased away, and being forsaken of others, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire themselues into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, lose nothing, but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their felicity. So, as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> said rightly, thinke and <note place="margin">Epist. 20.</note> desire this thing aboue all the prayers which thou shalt make vnto God, to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with thy selfe, and with those things that may spring from thy selfe: What felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, saith he, can be neerer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? Whereunto Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> subscribeth, In what Desart, saith hee, is not that man accompanied, that doth enioy a happy life?</p>
                  <p>He then that can liue alone, wil neuer grieue to be aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3718:65"/>
by men in death, being accompanied by Angels, &amp; by his Sauiour the true God. Thirdly, Physitions, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions and other expert men imploy themselues for thee, are about they to assist thee, and to restore thee to thy health. Thy wife, thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thy friends, with their teares would bathe thy bed, increase thy sorrow, and be infected with thy disease; It this then better both for thee and them that they be absent. Thou hast proued their affection in liuing, why wouldst thou try it in dying? thou doest leaue thy worldly friends in death, but thou goest to purchase more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and better in heauen, euen <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the Angells and the Saints: whereat then
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3718:65"/>
doest thou complaine? thou a Christian, whereas a Pagan reioyceth? <hi>Mercurius Trisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislus</hi> (by the report of <hi>Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius)</hi> sayd when he dyed, that he returned into his countrie where his kinsfolkes and best friends were. Finally thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusest thy disease, for that it takes from thee means to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of thy affayres. A wise man should not forbeare to settle his estate vntill the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamitie of an in curable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; for he hath then other matters to thinke of then worldly affayres: he should haue foreseene it, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in time; a good souldier when the trompet sounds to battaile, doth not begin to discourse of his house, and to thinke of some peece of ground, but prepares to fight
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3718:66"/>
for his life is in question. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so a wise man at the point of death should not once thinke of the world, but of the conflict which he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Diuell and sinne; there is question of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, of the life of his soule of the inheritance of heauen, which he loseth if he be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished: our life is vncertain, many other diseases besides the plague, may cut it off so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly; the Apoplexie, Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, Catarre, Squinancie, and many others, when they come leaue no place for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres. Therefore during the time of health let vs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound our quarrells with our neighbors, and dispose of our estates with our children &amp; kinsfolks, that we may bee ready at the first sommons of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3718:66"/>
our God, prepared at the first signe of that spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Combate which shalbe giuen vs, to fight well, to liue or to dye, as it shall please the Lord. Watch and pray, <note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> sayd Iesus Christ to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for you know not when that time shall be.

               <p>THe first proposition of this Argument can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee denyed after the experience which wee haue seene, after the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison which God makes of himselfe with a mother, who cannot forget her child, nor
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3718:71"/>
he his people: After that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ had said, No man giues a stone instead of bread nor a Scorpion for fish, to him that he loues: And how then can nature the liuely spring of so liuely a loue, giue any thing that is very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and fayle at neede and in the principall, hauing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fayled vs in all the course of our life? Now to proue that the second proposition is true, and that nature hath ordayned death for her children, <hi>Seneca</hi> doth teach <note place="margin">Ad Polib. 3</note> vs, saying, That death is a Law of nature, yea, that our whole life is but a way vnto it. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> also doth affirme that it is a decree intimated vnto the world, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is borne should haue an end: and from whom is this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3718:71"/>
decree? from God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of nature, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of this decree: but it is a fauourable decree to such as Heauen fauours.</p>
               <p>It is a generall Law, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store that which is lent vs; this life is but a loane, wee must restore it at the end of the time: it is a tribute wee owe, for we entred vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to depart when it shall please the master. Moreouer what is this life, but a harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rising from the mixture of the foure elements, which are the foure ingredients of our bodie? and what is death by the censure of Hippocrates, but a diuorce of marriage of these foure Elements? This diuorce is as naturall to man as it is naturall that fire should be contrarie to water,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3718:72"/>
and ayre to earth; for their contrarietie is the cause of this diuorce, which is death. I know that it is not sufficient for humane life to haue a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy well tempered with his Organes, and to haue the power of life, but he must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so haue a fist Effence; as a Lute well strung and well tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is not sufficient to make it sound, vnlesse there bee a hand to play vpon it. And I also maintayne that as the Musitian ceaseth to play when the Instrument is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strung, so the soule ceaseth to giue life vnto the body, yea, flyes out, when it is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but this destruction is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and by consequence death; and to that end Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath planted this body vpon pyles which take vent,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3718:72"/>
vpon boanes not very solide, caulkt ouer with soft flesh, glued with a viscous humour, which may easily melt with heate or dissolue with rayne; full of transparent veines ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to pierce; watered with vnholesome water, tempered with contrarie qualities, which a certaine temperature keepes at quiet for a season: but when euery one desires to command his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and time in the end pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the occasion, the common right being forced, the body sodainely falls. And this force is of nature, who must needes effect the words of the Lord, spoken vnto man: Thou art dust, and shalt returne to dust; Sonnes of men returne, but whither? From whence you came, to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3718:73"/>
the earth, to death; death then is of nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Milesian</hi> said, <note place="margin">Laert. lib. 1 Binson li. 7.</note> that there was no difference betwixt life and death, for that they are both equally according vnto Nature; and as one demanded of him, why he was in life and dyed not?

The answere of <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3718:73"/>
more vertuous, who being aduertised of the death of his deere and onely Sonne, sayd; O Messenger, thou bringest me no vnexpected newes, I know well I had begotten a Sonne that was mortall: hee was not insensible like a stone but he considered that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had chanced to his sonne but what he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene from his birth; his long foresight and his sodaine con sideration of the condition of all men for to die, had te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered all sorow in him, and brought him to reason, which should alwaies holde the helme of this little world man.

But this death brought in by Sathan, by sin, by man, hath no power ouer the children of God, &amp; good men (to whom this discourse is onely directed) since that it was subdued, bound and confined into hell by Iesus Christ our Sauiour (as <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> hath wel obserued) that as the waspe strikes violently against a stone, but hurts it not by her incursion, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>Moreouer for a more cleare solution of the argument, we must distinguish the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall nature from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: vniuersall nature is that vertue that admirable &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestigable proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> infused by God into the Vniuerse, the proper Instrument of the principall agent of this soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne essence, which hauing insinuated into this <hi>Chaos</hi> the first matter, hath brought it in six dayes too this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ornament, and hath preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it many thousand of yeares: of this nature, we de

As for particular nature (the very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plexion of euery one) to whom death is so terrible, I say it is an ill ordered feare. The Order is preposterous when as the particular doth not follow the Law of the generall; and it is the ruine

The king saw him among the rest and admired him, and obseruing his pale colour he inquired of him, the cause of his palenes, and was informed of his disease; the king thinking that by his cure his force and valour

Where fore we must therfore thinke of death, know, it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it. To this end the ancients did set dead bodies at the doores of their houses to be seene of passengers; for the same reason the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did cause an image of death to be carried about in their bankets and set vpon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not to strike terror into them, but rather a disdaine by the frequent beholding of what it is.

them that shall honour their parents. I answer, That God doth promise prolongation of a happy life to them that shall obey him. This happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is not in this world, it is onely to bee found in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; it is therefore of heauen, whither his speech tends: And although the literall sense be of the land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> yet was it a figure of the mysticall and chiefe abode; that is to say, of he auenly Paradise, which was the mould of this land, flowing with milke and honey, and all sorts of blessings. And if any one against this probable reason, will vnderstand the promise to be generall of the whole earth, we may answer, that God (like vnto Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) grants vnto men that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3718:97"/>
haue sicke spirits, not what is most profitable, but what they importunatly and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly desire.

It is the onely cause why it pleased the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall to take iust <hi>Abel</hi> vnto him by death, and would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer cursed <hi>Caine</hi> to languish long.

touching and doth stupefie and takes from it his sensitiue vertue: the thunderclap dulls the hearing, troubles the braine, and by a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a great noise makes him deafe, and so of the other sences.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if the reason of life consisted in the sences, who would beleeue that man were the more perfect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, seeing that many exceed him in sence? for the spider in the subtiltie of touching, the Ape in the bountie of tast, the Vulture in the force of smelling, the Boare in the ventue of hearing, and lastly the Linx in the seeing facultie exceeds him farre.</p>

life, that is to say, either for the preseruation of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiduum, by eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or of the Species by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. It is true that man applyes them also to other ends then we haue obserued: but those Creatures which haue nothing but the two first degrees of life, whereof we treat, imploy their sences to no other end, but to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themselues, or for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.

not whither: the <hi>Quaile</hi> by example wilbe moued at the singing of the masle, not for any delight shee takes, but from the motion to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which she feels kindled in her selfe. The Dog will faune and leape vpon his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, whom he had lost; and yet this doth not proceed from any naturall instinct, &amp; tends to no other end but to be kept, defended and fed by his sayd master. Finally hee that will duly obserue it, shal finde that all the sences of vnreasonable creatures haue no other end, but preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; generation an end inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the vegetatiue life; a life (we saw) had no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reason to moue our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; how then shall the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue haue?

Then comes the sight so piercing and passionate after the faire faces of women, and stayes not there onely, but (O shamefull sight) it will see the bodies naked, the which is condemned both by God and man: <hi>Romulus</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that man to death which suffered himselfe to bee seene naked by a woman; how much more is that woman to bee condemned, which layes aside all modestie with her smocke, as <hi>Giges</hi> said in <hi>Herodotus?</hi> The Emperours <note place="margin">Lib. 1.</note>

Here certainely should the true good of man bee found, if hee could attaine to the knowledge of the souereigne and first truth, seeing (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto Iesus Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life) That is eternall life to know one true and onely <note place="margin">Ioh. 17. c</note> God, and Iesus Christ whom he hath sent: But who can do it of himselfe? seeing that the onely meanes to attaine vnto it is folly vnto the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and scandall vnto the <hi>Iewes,</hi> as the Apostle saith. No man can doe it of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, no more then flye to heauen: hee alone obtaines this knowledge, who illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from aboue, hath made his reason captiue to his faith.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> Wee deny the Minor of the Argument; for it is not true that death is of it selfe to bee beloued: if it appeares so, it is but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of some extreame misery, which we apprehend in leauing it; for the liuing are (as we haue said) like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them which are carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way violently with a stream, who (to saue themselues) lay hold of that which comes first to hand, yea if it were a barre of burning Iron. If you will then aske them how

pleasing that estate is, you may easily ghesse what they will say, That if they were as certaine (as it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) that there were no harme in death (as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) they would not breake out into such complaints.

is made here, and whereof our question is, cannot bee without death: to desire to be a man, and not be willing to die, is not to desire to liue; for it is one of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, as shall appeare in the following Argument. Moreouer I adde, that what incertainty of the future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state soeuer you pretend, doubtlesse it cannot bee so miserable (except the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate) as that of this life.

                  <p>A Poet speaking of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary life sayd, That if there be not so great ioy, without doubt there is not so great paine: If death haue not the ioyes of this world, it hath not: the torments of life which are farre greater. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it for a certaine Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, that there are three things here below, which march equally with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant pace: the estate of the aire which they call time; life, and the opinion of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:3718:128"/>
man. And that which is worse, there are more cloudy dayes then cleere, more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable dayes for man then happy, and more changes to bad then good.</p>
                  <p>But that which should fully assure vs going out of this life, is Iesus Christ, who protests That no man shall pull his sheepe out of his hands, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.

This is certaine; but admit that it were not so, there is no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the world, be it neuer so short, but it leaues behind a venimous sting of serious repentance. I see thy large possessions, thy stately hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the amiable aspect of thy children, thy treasure, the greatnesse of thine honors, finally all the pompe in the world, raise thee vp with their goodly shewes; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, these things are not so happy as thou doest hold them: for proofe, looke vpon them that haue them in a higher degree then thy selfe, if notwithstanding they bee not miserable, they be transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory things; if thou leauest not them first, they will leaue thee; if thou doest affect them
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3718:129"/>
more then as an exercise for thy spirit, thou hast neither witt nor iudgement. This vnderstanding which makes the man, should not crouch vnder these carnall things: it must rayse vp him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to those which are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, to the beauties, bounties &amp; exquisite workmanship of this vniuers.

                  <hi>Homer</hi> faith, that sleepe &amp; death are brother and sister twinnes. Let vs obserue with <hi>Plutarque</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> shewes their similitude, terming them twinnes, for they that are so doe most commonly resemble. And in truth wee cannot denie but there is betwixt them great affinitie. It is one of the causes of death, the cold vapour, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested, and quenching the naturall heate, a vapor which appeares vpon the superficies
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3718:138"/>
of the bodie, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so call the sweat of death. Sleepe proceedes from the fume which the meat digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; causeth: this fume moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp and thickned by the coldnes of the braine, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends againe and disperseth it selfe ouer all, enters into the nerues, by the which both sence and motion is distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted throughout the whole body: so as death makes all the actions of the body to cease, euen so sleepe doth all the feeling of the sinnewes, of the senses, and all motion of the exterior members: For as wee doe often finde children lying asleepe vpon the ground, thinking they were dead; so man dying doth ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deceiue them that stand by, being not able to

iudge whether he be dead or sleepes. Man cannot alwayes watch, he must sleepe; neither can he liue for euer, he must dye: and as he growes idle that can take no rest, so hee is madd that thinkes, not to die.</p>
               <p>As he that stooping to his worke doth stemm with traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke Boate along the shore the streame, and pouring out himselfe in watrie sweate breakes all the bancks in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore: In retreate made to his Cottage, from the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring light, strecht on the straw sleepes soundlie all the night.</p>

And as he that hath eaten and drunke freely feels in his stomacke a gnawing and cruditie which hinders his rest; so hee that hath busied himself too much with worldly affayers, feels vpon the approching of rest a remorse of conscience, and an irresolution, which will not suffer him to imbrace death quietly, sleepe seazeth vpon m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Secondly, the losse of fight, of sences, of the habit of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

is grieuous to a liuing man, who hath enioyed them for a time, for that he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of sorrow: but to make it a conclusion to a dead man, who should be more grieued to haue lost all this, and life it selfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for that death is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of sorrow and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; wherein the Prouerbe of <hi>Hesiodus</hi> may be verrified; The moitie is more then the whole, the losse of sences and reason are more grieuous, and more to bee lamented then the priuation of life.</p>

                  <p>Finally, I maintayne, that the depth and horrour is as great to reason, to liue perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually here without end, the same life which wee now breathe; (for our discourse is of this life) as great I say and greater then to bee dead. depth; for who can perfectly comprehend a life without end? horrour, for who would alwayes liue with the feare of a hundred millions of horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

BY <hi>Syncope.</hi> I vnderstand the strongest and most extended swounding, not that which is gentle, which happeneth sometimes at the opening of a veine, in the which the patient neither loseth feeling nor speech, but that which carries away all the forces of a man, his natural (I say) and principally his vitall. Sleepe is nothing to represent death in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of this symptome, for it is death it selfe; only there is in this sometimes a retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to life, and there none. I haue seene it and obserued it in my father being an old man. I haue conferred it with some that were apparantly dead, yet could I not finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difference; he lay without

And that in this accident there is not any paine, experience doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and the report of such as reuiue is to bee credited, and serue for as good a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and will depose, that in the incursion of this death, there is nothing but quiet rest, so sound a sleepe, as the naturall is nothing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of this.

Be ing demanded if hee had felt no paine, he answered, No, &amp; did not remember that hee had any accident; so as all the time betwixt the first accesse of his disease and his separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was without his fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or memory. Thus if the

body becomes so insensible, that the soule (although it be present) suspends her action and agitation, what shall it then be in death, when being separated, shee shall haue no communion with it, how much more shall it bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paine? As for the bodies shaddow, there are none but litle children that are afraid, being not able for the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their iudgement to know what it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But they that haue any vnderstanding; and take a little leasure to obserue this obscure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Image; moouing at the shaking of their bodies, finde that it is only a priuation of the light; in the ayre opposed to their bodyes: for the Sun, the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or any other thing that shines, not able by his beams

of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> writes, that nature may say vnto vs, as the Philosopher did vnto his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, What I present vnto you with the right hand, you take with the left, your choice tends alwayes to the worst, you leaue what is good, and imbrace the bad; Let vs take things by the good end, wee shall finde that there is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of loue in that which we hate. For there is not any thing in the world, but is for the good of man; As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, you haue a sute with your neighbour, when you thinke of him, your sute coms to minde, and then you curse him and are disquieted: the reason is, you take it by the bad end; but take it by the other, and represent vnto your selfe that he is a man like

                  <p>Finally, the <hi>Stoicks</hi> hold for a Maxime, that a wise man is exempt from iniurie, either to giue or receiue: he cannot doe any, being borne onely to ayde; &amp; hee receiues none, for that being grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vertue, hee valiantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes all reproch &amp; wrong, so as hee is inuulnerable, as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith; not for that hee is not strooke, but for that, as hee saith, hee cannot bee hurt.</p>

                     <hi>Answer:</hi> I know that the Stoicks (with whose fethers our obiector decks himselfe) haue sought to frame their wise man of that fashion, that he should not be capable of any ill, but continually pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of a sollide ioy: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they haue purtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was but a vaine picture, without effect or truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like vnto the <hi>Chimeres</hi> and <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taures.</hi> Who wil beleeue that a wise man put vpon the racke, feeles no paine!

Finally, that a wise man beeing burnt, tormented and put in <hi>Phalaris</hi> burning bull, will notwithstanding say, O what a sweete life is this! Let them do what they list, I care not. These and such like are the Paradoxes of these Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who (as <hi>Cicero</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.

to the reasons obiected: The Sarazin <hi>Abdala</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands, that by some excellent relickes of thesoule, man is admirable to the world; but hee doth not touch his felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for hee hath nothing of that remayning; since his transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he is continually here below, miserable in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree: He had the gift of free will, to haue enioyed his owne happynesse if hee had would; but for that hee abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, he lost himselfe and his liberty, saith S. <hi>Augustine.</hi> He rules ouer all creatures, but a miserable domination, in the which the meanest sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect exceeds his Lord in feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie; and twise miserable, in the which the Lord suffers more miserie then the most wretched of his subiects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:3718:157"/>
Reade <hi>Plutarke,</hi> and then <hi>Homer,</hi> but aboue all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in the holy writ, who knowes what wee are, and qualifies man with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther titles, but of darkenesse, <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> and foolishnesse to thinke a good thought of himselfe; a brutish man, who compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends not the things which are of the Spirit, and cannot <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.</note> vnderstand them, for they are spiritually discerned.</p>
                  <p>Finally, hee shewes him to <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. Coloss. 2.

                  <p>Moreouer, if <hi>Seneca</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to retayne men in life,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:3718:158"/>
teach them what they ought to doe, it is no argument that they diuert them from death when shee shall present her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto them: but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise, <hi>Seneca</hi> doth in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <note place="margin">Epist. 36. Epist. 24. 31.</note> generally protest, That death hath no discommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that it is not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ill, but without the feare of ill, and that it is a foolish thing to feare it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As for life hee calls it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful and vicious, for that it is alwayes imperfect. But see how vpon this question hee opens his heart to sorrowfull <hi>Martia</hi> for the death of her <note place="margin">De consol. ad Mart. 32. Epist. 202. ad Mart. c. 20.</note> sonne; O ignorant men, saith he, of their owne miseries, which doe not commend death, as the goodlyest inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature! For whether that she holds felicitie inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3718:158"/>
or excludes calamitie; be it that shee ends the satie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and wearinesse of old age, or that shee carries away youth in his flower, in the hope of better things; be it that shee calls vnto her the most vigorous age, before that it hath mounted the roughest steps, yet is she to all men their end, to some a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, to some a vow; and those are more bound vnto her, to whom she coms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling. He goes on, but he cuts off his discourse to come to the end of his life which was cut off: for being commanded by <hi>Nero</hi> to dye, without any delay hee willed his Surgeon to open a veine in his foote, holding it in a bason of warme water, and saw with drie eyes his life fade
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:3718:159"/>
away. But S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> assures, that a good conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce makes the life happy; Be it so, but forgets to adde, That in the death of the faithfull this happynesse is doubled, for it is pretious before God: And in the end I deny that those men, in whom a melancholy humour doth most abound, suffer themselues to bee so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused in their iudgements: for this humour is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised then all the rest, hauing some diuine matter in it, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith; and therefore more to be credited then the rest, and particularly more then the Iouiall sanguine.</p>
                  <p>As for the admonition of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> it was easie for them to speake it, but vertue consists in action: and I know not whether <hi>Epictetus</hi> did
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3718:159"/>
that himself which he taught to others; otherwise (as the prouerbe saith) I hate the Philosopher which is not wise but for others, and not for himselfe. You will that I take the most troublesome things on the best fide; yea, but I see no end of that side: it is like vnto occasion, which hath long haire before, and bald behinde. Where is that end then? I cannot see it, and admit I should, I cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it, being borne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the planet of <hi>Saturne,</hi> &amp; alwaies taking things on that side which is sadde.

                  <p>Finally, the pleasure of this world is very small, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt with many displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: It is a Myne where there is gold, but it is so fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the stones, as to draw one crowne it will cost 12.

which being prouoked came forth, assaile him and sting him on the throate, backe, in the eyes, and generally all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And it auailes him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pierce the ayre with his homes, to beate the earth with his feete, to whippe his flankes with his strong tayle, to roare &amp; make a noyse; yee his stingings sticke still-to him, and do not leaue him: So man since that in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures garden, in the earthly Paradise, he durst presume to ouerthrow and transgresse his Masters commandments, there is no part of him from the head to the foote, which is not toucht and pierced e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the marrow of his bones with many calamities: his head is subiect to infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Phrensies, which make
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3718:161"/>
him madd; to the <hi>Apoplexie,</hi> which like Lightening de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priues him of all motion; his eyes are toucht with the <hi>Opthalmie</hi> or infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation: the Squinancie takes him by the throate, which making the Muscles to swell with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed bloud, stoppe the passage of respiration: the inflamed Pleurisie stabs him in the sides; the Feauer burns him, the swelled Dropsie drownes him: the Iaundise makes war against his Liuer, powring forth gall for pure bloud; the vngentle Cholike wrings his bowells, straitens the passages, and makes of his mouth a stinking Iakes; the bloudy flux excoriates his gutts: the hardened grauell staying his vrine in the blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, pricks him most horribly:
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:3718:162"/>
the Goute knits his sinnews faster then bonds of Iron: the Canker burnes his flesh more then fire it selfe; the filthie and lousie Phtiriasis eats his skin: Finally, there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny member either within or without the body, that is not subiect to many infirmities; Who can comprehend them all, seing the eyes alone by exact search of Physitions is assayled with 113. diseases? And who doth not see here that the estate of man is very wretched? And that which doth aggrauate this, is, that euen those helps wherewith they think to ease themselues the medicins are conuerted into worse torments then thé disease: the strict dyets, the bitter potions, the cutting and burning of members,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3718:162"/>
which they vse in Cankers and other vlcers; that tubbe wherein they boyle the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of such as are infected with the venerian scab, or the French poxe; with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand other deuices to restore health and life to man: what torments, what agonies, and what cryes do they not cause vnto the poore patients? These miseries are great, but those of the minde are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which seemed for her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extraction not to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any. Come and let vs runne ouer her faculties: the vnderstanding holds the chiefe place; at the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of life we see in infants a greater ignorance then in brute beasts: Fawns as soone as they are borne know their. dammes, and without helpe
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3718:163"/>
of any, goe into the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret places to seeke the dug and sucke; whereas children new borne know not where they are, and being neere the breast, will crie and perish with hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger rather then suck, as S, <hi>Augustine</hi> writes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth teach: This ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance <note place="margin">Lib 1. de pec. mer. &amp; remis. c. 38.</note> hath taken such deepe roote in the spirit os man; as to roote it out, and passe vnto the sciences, there is found such difficultie, as most men had rather liue perpetually in darkenes, then to take so much paines to learne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, (and that is most lamentable) man knowes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his last end, in the getting of which knowledge consists his soueraigne good; hee goes alwayes astray, if
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:3718:163"/>
God doth not inspire him from aboue. Let all the sects of Philosophers be witnesse, who by so many diuers waies haue sought it, yet could not finde it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the ignorance in man of his Essence, is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble misery: the Angels know themselues perfectly. The soule knowes nothing lesse then it selfe: and the body which was giuen it for an Organ of the Sciences, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it, that she neither knows her selfe, nor any other thing; for the body which corrupts, makes the soule heauie, and <note place="margin">Wis. 6.</note> this earthly habitation puls downe the spirit, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not raise it selfe to thinke of many things. For a fift point there is a curiositie or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall itching, to obserue the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:3718:164"/>
actions &amp; errours of others, more willingly and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then his owne; this misery is great: for to know his owne faults is alwayes profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and many times neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; to examine other mens actions, is seldome good, and many times pernicious.</p>
               <p>There is for the 6. place, and for the deepest degree of the calamitie of man, the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his will: he wils not that which hee should, and wils that which hee should not: that which hee should do is conformable to nature; to reason, &amp; to vertue; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Law is written in his heart, and the seed cast in his spirit. Other creatures moue speedily and easily, to that which is proper vnto them and seemely, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:3718:164"/>
they go vnwillingly and by force, to that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to their nature. But men, they reioyce when they haue done euill, they take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in their impious works, saith wife <hi>Salomon:</hi> Man <note place="margin">Prou. 2.</note> drinkes sinne as the fish doth water, saith <hi>Iob.</hi> Yea the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is so generall, as it is become a prouerb, It is a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane thing to erre: he thoght so, who to excuse his sinne of adultery, said, The night, loue, wine and my yong age, perswaded me vnto it, &amp;c. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, wil you see a great signe of great misery in the spirit of man, which is, that he is neuer content with his condition, an other pleaseth him better. Other creatures apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues easily to the course that is offered vnto them, &amp;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:3718:165"/>
seeke no change: it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of sicke persons to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sometimes one thing, sometimes an other, to change beds hourely, as if in the bed only consisted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of their griefe; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire one kind of meate, and are presently distasted.

               <p>In man that facultie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which was giuen him as a strong man at armes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse all that outwardly should offer to trouble him; behold how it seeks to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere ouer reason, how it treads it vnder foote, and turnes man into a madd dog to bite, and into a Scorpion to flatter and sting, and into worse then that Let vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, and leauing those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall infirmities, Let vs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the accidentall; How many haue endured an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable torment by thirst, which hath forced them to

Then hunger, which could not abstaine from humaine bloud, but hath fallon vpon dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses, and liuing men; not onely vpon strangers, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mothers vpon their own children, deuowring them cruelly and greedily, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">Lament. 4. 10.</note> the sacred historie and Pagan is full.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is so great paine to maintaine this dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, that man in this world hath lesse rest then a Mill Asse; Man is borne to labour as a bird to flie, sayth the holy writ: and the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cries from heauen; Thou shalt eate thy bread with the sweate of thy browes. Doe not tell me that this is no generall Law: it is; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3718:167"/>
exception, hee that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells not with his bodio, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels in minde: thinke you that ambitious and voluptuous men, yea theeues, are not more troubled and vexed then handy-crafts men? If you reply, that at the least stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are happie; yea, in com parison of them that are more miserable: but being considered absolutely, they haue their part of miserie by their sitting life, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to meditation; they haue sooner filled their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with diseases, then their soules with knowledge. Moreouer, he that adds know ledge, adds torment, sayth the wise man; and yet most part of students haue no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner learned the tongues, the instruments of sciences, nor
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:3718:167"/>
the principles, but they must leaue all, eyther through death, which cutsthem off; or through age, which tends vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, &amp; which depriues them of all ablenes, memorie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie, sight &amp;c. Wherefore one dying complaynes, that when he began to know ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things and to gouerne his life well, he was called out of life. Another beginnes his booke with these words: <note place="margin">Hippoc. Aph. 1.</note> Life is short, the arte long, the occasion hasty, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience dangerous, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment difficult: as if he would say, Miserable man, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly for his short con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, for his weeke iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the slownesse of his flesh, for the slippery estate of the world, attaine vnto that knowledge which is so
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3718:168"/>
necessary for him. But this is not all, we haue yet but light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runne ouer the miseries which man hatcheth in his bosome; they which assayle him without are more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: Hee hath his God and Lord interessed and angry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, wee are all borne the children of wrath, the whole world makes warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; and what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, seeing that hee that rules it is his enemy? he is infe sted with the incursions of spiritual malices, which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the most cloudy ayer, are alwayes ready like carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on kites to fall vpon the prey of man. Man is alwayes to man, &amp; in al places a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some enemy, and the ancient prouerbe sayeth, That man is a wolfe to man, and the more
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:3718:168"/>
meanes he hath to hurt, the more dangerous hee is; and in truth neuer Tigers, Onces, or Lyons, haue so torne men in pieces, as the <hi>Phelares;</hi> the <hi>Busines,</hi> the first Emperors, the <hi>Massachiers,</hi> &amp; <note place="margin">Benz. l. 3. c. 5.</note> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at the <hi>West In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, there is not any little Creature which doth not shoote out the darts of his poore splene against man, being grieued to see such a Tyrant reigne vpon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

drowne him, they burne him. If thou thinkest in fayre weather to walke into thy Garden, to recreate thy selfe, the Aspike attends thee in ambush vnder ome flower or herbe which thou doest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to gather.

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:3718:179"/>
foolishnesse, &amp; thus he speaks It is the part of a coward, and not of a valiant man, to dye by reason of pouerty, of loue, <note place="margin">Ethie. ad Eud. lib. 3.</note> or for any other thing that is troublesome; it is a faintnesse to flie difficult things; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, He suffers not death as a good thing, but flying the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</p>
                  <p>Finally, he that murthers himselfe, wipes himselfe for euer out of the booke of life; for that he dies impenitent, in the act of sinne, neuer to haue remission after this life, nor (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth) any indulgence of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

But for the present, support couragiously, inhabite this region in the which he hath placed you; this habitation is short, easie, not burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, &amp;c. The 1. reason in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, that life and death are indifferent, is false; for it is to teare in pieces the sacred communion of the soule with the body, of man with his neighbour, to kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Man is not borne for himselfe, but after God for his Country, which hee depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth of a good son, such as he ought to bee. <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath <note place="margin">Ethic. l. 5. c. vlt.</note> seene it, and hath written it, saying, That he that kils him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe doth wrong vnto the Comonalty; but to doe wrong is no indifferent thing:

The 2. reason which speakes so much of li berty, is friuolous and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; for what liberty is there in a dead man? who hath neither the power nor the will to chase away a fly that stings him; who is made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to all sorts of wormes, rottennes, and stench what is liberty, but a power to do what we list? but death nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath will, action, nor my power: it a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>As for the third, poysons
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:3718:180"/>
are giuen by the earth rather to preserue life, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to destroy it, to make antidotes &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiues against malignant and venimous diseases, and a thousand vnexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, by the biting of mad or venimous beasts: omitting the true cause of diuines, that the sinne of man hath infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all, powring forth his poyson vpon the Creatures which e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Finally, examples binde vs not, but rules; wee liue not according vnto others, but as we ought: the Law of God is plaine, sealed in the particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of euery one, Thou shalt not kill, by the which we are forbidden the simple homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:3718:181"/>
of our neighbor, for that he is of humaine blood; next the parricide of father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for we are their blood; which doth much augment the hainousnes of the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: 3. The murthering of our selues, which exceeds parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide in a degree of horror. To this we must haue regard, not vnto what <hi>Zeno,</hi> or <hi>Cleanthes</hi> haue done. And the <hi>Stoickes</hi> who in all other places so much recommend vnto their Disciples, seemelines, honesty and duty, seeme to me in this point forgetfull, blind &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaricators: what shal we then do? That which a wise <hi>Pagan</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Curt. l. 5.</note> did aduise vs; It is for valiant men, sayd he, rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne death, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hate life. Many times faint hearted me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are driuen to a base co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:3718:181"/>
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, throgh the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of labor, but vertue will trie al things: Seeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that death is the end of all things, it is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to go ioyfully vn to it. To his words we adde, That our inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is not to take away life, but the terror of death when it comes: a wise man wil liue ioyfully, so long as it shall please the Lord of life: He wil die also more ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully when it shall please the same Lord. This is that he ought to do, and doubtlesse man may without sin desire, yea pray vnto the Lord that hee may liue long for many reasons, but especially for 2. The one concernes the glory of God, in the administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the charge which hee hath committed vnto vs; therefore the Son of God in
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3718:182"/>
dying would saue his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by that voice full of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which he vsed to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine</hi> souldiers and <hi>Iewes,</hi> If you seeke me, let them go: the which preserued them long, especially his well-beloued S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> whom he retained in life vnto ninety yeares. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respects our children, parents, and friends, of whom <note place="margin">Iohn 18. 8.</note> we may and ought in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue a care, seeing that (by the censure of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) hee which hath not a care of his family, hath deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">1.

                  </p>
                  <p>But besides these reasons and some others which doe simbolize, I say that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to liue were not fit, if there were no other reason; sor there is no ceasing from

                     </gap>lpable we are before God: So as I maintaine, that the feare to vndergo death, I meane death simply, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vicious, foolish and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
                  <p>But to be a Murtherer of himselfe, without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it is much more execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the Lawes of euery well gouerned Common-weale haue thundred against it: yea the Grecians: in the midst of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

through the streets of the Citie: and in such cases God doth vsually shew visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble signes of his reuenging wrath: So in Parthenay a towne in Poitou, a certaine woman in the absence of her husband, was taken with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilish despaire; she tooke the little children, when shee had smothered them and hanged them, then she came vnto her selfe, went vp on a stoole and hung her selfe, and and thrust awaie the stoole with her foote; but the rope brake, and she falling downe halfe dead, found a knife, (the Diuell is a readie officer to furnish instruments to doe euill) which she takes and thrusts into her bosome; The next day, the matter being knowne, all the world ranne

thither with the iudges, who caused her bodie to be cast out vpon a dunghill neere vnto the towne wall.

It seemes that most of those crier sout for death, make that their refuge, when she appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth neere them. <hi>Esope</hi> in the Apologue hath naturally described it by that old man, who being laden with a great burthen, and falling into a Ditch, he grew to despaire; and calling for death, death came, and commands him to follow him; O no, said he, I call thee to helpe me vp with my burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I may returne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> I know well that many feare death much, not for any desire to liue, nor for the pleasures they haue in life (for the two examples ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected shew the contrarie) but for that they know not what death is.

I therefore persist in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; that it is nothing but the feare, which man hath to fall into some greater miserie (as we haue shewed) doth make him so much apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d death.

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:3718:192"/>
that death is very euill, when it is a priuation from all euil, hee is amazed with a false a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme: So women and weake spirits dare not remaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in their Chambers, for that they imagine they shal see spirits and apparitions; little children are afraid to see their parents masked, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianax</hi> could not endure the sight of <hi>Hector</hi> armed: but lay aside these armes; take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the maske, &amp; you shall conuert their feare into assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and their cries into ioy: So pull away these false maskes of hideous lookes, and the trembling cries of them that die, they are but fained, or sorrowes grownded in the aire of an imaginary euill.

Wil you haue an apparent signe, that in this horrible apprehension of death mans iudgement is troubled, and therefore sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to bee false? The strongest and most vigorous, the yongest and most iust, do least feare the losse of life; who in reason should appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it most, if it were to be feared, hauing more interest in it; but old men and such as are subiect to the cholike &amp; stone, and malefactors, feare it without measure. <hi>Maecenas</hi>

               <p>How many <hi>Messales</hi> offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders would liue in torture, or broken vpon the wheele, so as they might not end their liues: What is the reason of this? but that his iudgement is peruerted, beleeuing that all the paine he feeles shall be doubled in death. If he be a reprobate, and vnderstands it of the second death, and not of the first whereof wee now discourse, his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is right; but for a good man to thinke that there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great paine in a naturall death, hee erres much. It is not the death (said <hi>Aeschines)</hi> but the violent passion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:3718:193"/>
death, which is horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If they thinke there bee any discomodity in death (sayd the old man <hi>Bassus,)</hi> let <note place="margin">Sen. epi. 30.</note> them know, it comes from them that die, not from death, which frees them of all paine.</p>

May a man paint a voice, the which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be inuisible, yet it falls vnder the sence of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? but death in what sence so euer you take it, is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all sence; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, not to bee drawne by any pencel. What is death then? it is a word of few let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which hath no subsista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce but in imagination; nothing

               <p>So <hi>Epictetus</hi> spake to the men of this time.

Aristonimus</hi> sayd, that the life <note place="margin">Max. in serm. 67.</note> of man was like a Theater, on the which the most wicked held the first rankes. <hi>Aeneas Syluius</hi> writes, that our life is a comedy, whereof the last <note place="margin">Leg. coment de reb. gest.

THIS Argument is grounded vpon the Diuine Oracle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to <hi>Adam:</hi> That day thou shalt eate of the fruite of the tree of knowledge of good and euill, thou shalt die the death; &amp; the Apostle saies that Death is the reward of sin. As for men, in Cities wel gouerned, their lawes impose the punishment of death for theeues, murtherers, sedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp;c. <hi>I answer:</hi> That death in her beginning is bad, but not in her deriuation; but it is good, in respect of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and wisedome, who drawes light from darkenes, good from euill, &amp; life from death; for now by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, death serues as a ladder to the faithfull to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vp into heauen. So the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:3718:209"/>
diuersity of tongs sent at the building of the Tower of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> proceeded from the fury of God kindled against the builders, to frustrate their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize: Yet the same tongs haue bene since imparted to the Apostles, vpon <hi>White-son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> by the fauour of God, thereby to haue the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Lord declared. So garments were inuented in token of the losse of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Innocency; and yet in continuance they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an honorable orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our bodies, as wee see Euen so in the beginning God sent death in his fury; and since he sent it in fauour to <hi>Enoch,</hi> to <hi>Iosias,</hi> and to all them, hee loues. The holy Ghost speaking by the penne of <hi>Salomon,</hi> sayth, that
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:3718:210"/>
hee more esteemes the dead which are already dead, then the liuing which are yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. As for malefactors, death is not inflicted vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it is simply death, but for two reasons adiace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; the one is, that depriuing them of all motion, it makes them cease to commit any more euill, &amp; frees the Country of such vermine. The other, that it is imposed for a publike infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and therefore they are set vpon scaffolds and gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets in publike place; &amp; this deserued infamy is the true torment of the punishment, death is but an accident: and do wee not see many delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents desire an honorable graue more then life? the which they would not do, if they held death to bee the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:3718:210"/>
worst of euills, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an extreame dishonor, in which they feele their soules to suruine. <hi>Bias</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did answere wittily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded which of all kind of death was the worst, That, sayth hee, which the Lawes haue ordained: infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereby, that a naturall death is not euill, but that which crimes haue deserued, the which is not giuen by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by a hangman: and yet not so much by the execu tioner, who is but the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as by a villanie perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, which is the true cause.

in the nature of man, the which not able to do in him without his totall ruine, hee hath done in his surety, in Iesus Christ his Son, whom to that end hee sent into the world to take humaine flesh in the Virgins wombe: It is he that was wounded for our offences, broken for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, <note place="margin">Esay 53. 5.</note> censured to bring vs peace, and slaine to cure vs, as the Prophet speakes, and the Apostles testifie.

                  <p>And these are the reasons why Iesus Christ was terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in death, feeling the wrath of God vpon him for our sinnes: But the death of the faithfull is nothing like; for in the greatest torments which Tyrants can inflict vpon them, it mortifies the sence and takes away all paine, by the abundance of his conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> writes of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and as our <hi>Annales</hi>

and drinke, inward sicknesse, and old age. These foure kinds of death may happen to al men, yea to wise men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by iniustice touching the first; by some rare acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as touching the second; concerning the third, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary corruption of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; and by an infallible defect of nature touching the fourth. Paine (according to the definition of learned Phisitions,) is the feeling of some thing that is offensiue and troublesome to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the body, for that it is contrary to the health thereof; the which happens either by the dissoluing and cutting of his continued sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; or by the alteration thereof, which alteration proceeds from the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:3718:224"/>
heate or cold: for as for humidity and drinesse, they are rather passiue qualities then actiue, whose operation is very slow, and the paine in the member that is altered, is suddaine not gentle; as if you be exceeding cold and come to a very sensible paine, cold settles his paine in disioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; heate in burning: and it is to bee noted, that any sence may be wounded, yet little or nothing is his paine, in comparison of that of touching, the which is disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ouer the whole body, &amp; from which no other vessell of the sences is exempt; which is the cause that wee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times feele prickings in the eyes, and shootings in the eares, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now come to the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:3718:225"/>
application, Death which comes to man by extreame age, can be no cause of paine; there being nothing in him that tortures his body, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that doth suddainely alter and change him by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame cold, or heate; but his life goes out presently (like vnto a Candle that wants tallow) by the losse of his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall humour, deuoured by little and little since his birth by his naturall heate: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this heate doth yet striue as it hath formerly done, to conuert the meate which is familiar and fit for the body, into radicall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, to repaire his losse, yet she can worke no more, her vertue failes her; euery agent hath his vertue limited, what soeuer doth act, suffers in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting:
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:3718:225"/>
through vse and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time this heate decayes, dissolues, is lost, and death ensues: So as it hath bene disputed in vaine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life might bee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this radicall humor being restored by some fit nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for that humor being at the first a certaine ayery &amp; onely portion of that seede which doth reside in all the sollide parts, it is impossible that such an humour, and so much as is needefull, should be supplied in it's place. The only fruite of the tree of life which was in <hi>Eden,</hi> had this secret vertue, by the diuine ordinance, to make man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal that shold eate ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and therefore according to the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Fathers, God suddenly after the sin,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:3718:226"/>
chased <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> out of <hi>Eden,</hi> least they should lay hold of that fruite, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">Irenae. Hilarie. Greg. Naz. Theodoret. Chrysosto. and others.</note> immortally miserable with the diuells. In processe of time there happens two notable changes to this radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call humour; the one in the quality, for that it degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates by little and little, &amp; of naturall becomes strange: the other in the quantity, for that it is wholy wasted; whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man being once reduced, he can suffer no paine: if hee complaines, it is rather for griefe that hee must dye, or some other distemperature, and not the death, which doth cause some troublesome alteration in his sinewes &amp; sensible parts.</p>
                  <p>As for death which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from diseases, there are
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:3718:226"/>
some long, others short. If they be long, the paine is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for that nature doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome it selfe to that which comes by degrees; it turnes to a habite, and hee feares no griefe, or very little, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but the suddain alteration which nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure: that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth pain is that which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the good temperature, the which in very long languishing diseases comes slowly and insensibly. As for example, in an Hectick feuer they grow leane, and consume away by little and little, and dye with paine, which is in a manner imperceptible; there is nothing but an heauinesse of the spirits, but in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes feele no paine. It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so of the paine of the
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:3718:227"/>
Lights, whereon the rheume distilling, it doth consume them by little and little, as a spout of water doth a stone, so as in the end this infirmity brings the patient insensibly to death.</p>
                  <p>As for short diseases, the paine is short: What great pain can there be in a swoun ding? in an Appoplexie that happens by the sudaine dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the spirits? What great paine can a moment of time bring to man? But you wil reply, that there are disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses wonderfully sharpe: It is true; but if you will obserue them, they are least dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for death, whereof our discourse is. Nature giuing death, knowes how to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the members so wel, and to weaken the vertue of the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:3718:227"/>
sinewes, as man cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne when death seazeth on him, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when sleep surprizeth him. It is an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorisme</hi> of <hi>Hipocrates,</hi> When a sicke body (saith he) feeles no paine, playes with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of his bed, and pulls off the wooll, it is a signe of death, and no likelihood of life &amp; what paine then, when as hoping to recouer, and feeling ease of his paine, hee shall dye? As for famine and thirst, which quench the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life, that happens very seldome, and the <hi>Annales</hi> in 16. ages haue scarce obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued two, the one vnder the Empire of <hi>Honorius,</hi> at what time in the Theater at <hi>Rome</hi> there was this strange voyce heard, You must set a price <note place="margin">Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Here in truth is great horror, but little paine, neither can I beleeue (whatsoeuer they say) that he which dies of hun ger feeles no great torment: examine it by your selfe; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue fasted long, you shall feele a great debility, &amp; a great appetite, or a great heate in all your members, but no great paine: it is in the sinewes to feele where the paine lies, which sinewes do not suffer any thing in the extreamity of hunger or thirst, but the principal parts which receiue the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore in this most pittifull; and pitty is here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the paine. Let the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:3718:228"/>
death of <hi>Charles</hi> 7. the French King, be an example vnto vs, who being full of suspition and way wardnesse, &amp; enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that humor by the dayly reports of his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold flatterers, that they would attempt against his person; yea a Captaine in whom he trusted most, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him that they meant to poyson him; he gaue such cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to this aduice, as he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued neither to eate nor drinke in which capricious humor hee continued seuen dayes. But in the end being prest not with paine but by his Phisitions, and house hold seruants; who laid before him the danger of life, whereinto he did voluntarily bring his person when hee would haue eaten he could not, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:3718:229"/>
(sayth the History) the passages of the stomake were shrunke. Let vs weigh these last words, and acknowledge, that this naturall fire in vs wherewith the lampe, of our life is kindled, is like vnto the Elementary, alwayes actiue; wherefore wanting his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary nutriment, hee turnes himselfe violently vpon that which beares it, vpon the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall humidity, the which it doth waste and consume in a short time; and this humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being consumed, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers remaine dry, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vigour; so as when they offer them the accustomed remedy, hauing lost their vsuall vertue, they disgest it not, but cast it vp againe.</p>
                  <p>It is the same reason why such as obserue a certaine
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:3718:229"/>
houre for their meales, when this houre is come they feele certaine motions of an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite in their stomacke, which requires meate: But if they passe this houre, either by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting or by diets, they lose their appetites, for that this heate being frustrated of his ordinary repast, falls either vpon the peccant humor, or that failing, vpon the vitall humour; and as we suffer it to do more or lesse, so we receiue more or lesse preiudice. Now if in the first and most sensible touches of this natural heate, we feele no great torment, as euery man may try in the religious fasts of the Church, which passe the ordinary time of eating three or foure houres: I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude necessarily, that the longer they abstaine
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:3718:230"/>
from meate, the lesse they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; for the heate decaying still, by the want of nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the actiue vertue also decreaseth, and his subiect the body, suffereth lesse by such a languishing acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; also the body which for his part decayes in force, is daily lesse susceptible of paine, vntill that all his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor being exhausted, and his heate euaporated, hee must die.</p>
                  <p>Last in ranke come good men, who are vniustly put to death by Tyrants, to whom the paine is sensible according to the horror of the punishment. But I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: First, that it happens seldome, God holding in his power the Tyrannous resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of great men; that they
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:3718:230"/>
may not execute their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked designes against his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: wickednesse shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer preuaile so much, she shal neuer conspire so strongly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vertue, but the name of wisedome shall alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine sacred and venerable. <note place="margin">Sen. epi. 14.</note> Secondly, God who suffers it, giues them ease in their torments, &amp; knowes how to restraine and suspend their paines; (as hee did to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, <hi>Sidrac, Mizac,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bednego</hi> in the burning fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace:) as they go ioyfully to death, and sing the praises of the Lord cheerefully in the middest of the fire, as hath bene seene in the Martyrs: And thus much for this point. But if after all these reasons they persist still in a fantasticall apprehension of
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:3718:231"/>
some great paine in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of death, wee will adde, that it is not fitting to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse death; it is life, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders whereof cause the paine, and death is the end. Wherefore <hi>Diogenes</hi> being demanded if death were euil, How can it be (sayd hee) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we neuer feele it present? and that which is absent can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee hurtfull to any man; whilest that man hath fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he hath life, but if he bee dead, hee hath no feeling, and that which is not felt, is not hurtfull.</p>
                  <p>And therefore hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that it was not death which was euill, but the way to death, which was misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; which if we feare, what is all the life (said he) but a path tending vnto death? And

Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> confirmes this, when he <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de li. arb. c. 13,</note> attributes the disdain of life, and the contempt of death, to the force of the minde: The greater and more despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the danger is, the more doth magnanimity increase in a generous minde, to free all difficulties, that hee shall encounter. And seeing that the end is better and more excellent then that which tends vnto it, hee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:3718:232"/>
with reason, That hee were better to lose his life then vertue. But Fortitude, one of the foure cardinall vertues, besides the generall, hath a particular reason, why man should seeke to preserue it in her greatest perfection; for by it hee enioyes the true tranquility of the minde, the which (as <hi>Cicero</hi> reports) is nothing else but a quiet, sweete, and pleasing disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the soule, in all the euents of life: Which carries two Crownes; patience in paine, &amp; resolution in death. By which the confirmation of the Minor is inferred, there beeing nothing that doth more oppugne, and in the end ouerthrow all force and resolution, then the extreame
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:3718:233"/>
feare of death. Feare, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that of death, beeing destitute of reason &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wounds the soule with amazement, alienates his right sense, makes it idle and without action; it doth waste him, vndermine him, and consume him as rust doth I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and the worme an apple. A man alwayes shaking with feare, is without heart and courage, but halfe a man; such as histories report <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Caesar,</hi> the 5. Emperour to haue beene, whom nature had begun, but not finished, for that hee was base and faint-hearted.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, feare by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible obiect of death, causeth the heate which is the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot of force, to retire into the bottome of the belly, in stead
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:3718:233"/>
of drawing it about the heart as courage doth, so as the heart is alwayes panting: and which is worse, whereas it should extend it selfe by dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in his natural motion, hee shrinkes himselfe vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst nature, whereby there followes a great debility in all the members of the body, and sometimes death, as it happened to <hi>Lycas;</hi> who vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the very report of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> force, was so terrified, as beeing retired into the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of an Altar, dyed there. But a generous man resolute to death, will not feare any thing that shall present it selfe to crosse him in the course of his duty; like vnto <hi>Anaxarchus,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> threatning to hang, he said, Threaten thy Courteours,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:3718:234"/>
who feare death; for my part I care not whether I rot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue or vnder the earth. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> also beeing blamed by one, for that hee did a thing which would cause his death, he answered, My friend, thou art not well informed, if thou thinkest that a man of honor shold apprehend danger, yea, death in his actions; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consider whether they bee iust or vniust, good or bad. Such was the courage of the Prophet <hi>Micheas,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted King <hi>Achas,</hi> and told <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of his sinnes; being filled with vertue by the Spirit of the Eternal, with iudgement and with force, as he himselfe <note place="margin">Mic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Thirdly, feare not onely hurts it selfe, causing his arms to fall out of his hands, and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:3718:234"/>
laying him open to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies darts; but like vnto the plague it infects others. And therefore King <hi>Agamemnon</hi> would not that a rich man and a fearefull should goe to the warres of <hi>Troy;</hi> but to stay him, he would haue sent him a distaffe, if he would not eouer his shame honestly. But on the other side, a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant man finds meanes to free himselfe in the greatest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. So <hi>Aristomenes</hi> a <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian,</hi> being taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and deliuered bound to two souldiers, hee found meanes to burne his bonds and his flesh to the quicke; then falling couragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon his guardes, hee slue them, and so escaped. It is a common saying among men, That vertue hath no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:3718:235"/>
if it be not in paine: and the greatest paine in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of man, is when hee is at the point of death; then should a valiant heart shew his inuincible courage, to va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quish this terror of death. It is this courage which made Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That if he did serue for an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 18.</note> vpon the sacrifice &amp; seruice of faith, hee was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. It is the same Spirit that made <hi>Ignatius</hi> to say, beeing condemned by Infidels to be cast to wild beasts: I am the wheate of God, I shall bee <note place="margin">Iren. lib. 5.</note> ground in the teeth of beasts, to bee made pure and cleane bread.</p>
               <p>If the Trumpet which sounds an alarme, be pleasing to a valiant Souldier, what shall death bee to a vertuous
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:3718:235"/>

They that haue the chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and the gout, are not so much terrified with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of their paine; and can vertuous men so much feare death, which hath not so much paine, no none at all? seeing that what we feel whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death approcheth, is of the re mainder of life, not of death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to what end serues this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly feare? Fly an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable death of the one side, and a shamefull end will find thee of the other. So <hi>Sisera</hi> left his Armie and fled into <note place="margin">Iudg. 4.</note> the house of <hi>Iahel;</hi> but when
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:3718:236"/>
he thought to take his rest, <hi>Iahel</hi> came and draue a nayle of the Tabernacle into the temples of his head, and slue him.</p>
               <p>But to haue this courage and resolution to resist the terror of death, it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to speake in the time of health, as Souldiers do of their valour at the table: lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned discourses (sayth <hi>Seneca)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Epist, 26.</note> make no demonstrations of true magnanimity; the most feareful will sometimes speak more boldly then they shold.

               <p>We ought to do it, for Christ is a gaine to vs both <note place="margin">Philip. 1.</note> in life and death; for that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we change the drosse of the world, for the gold of heauen; we going out of life, as out of a deepe pit of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and ignorance: and wee ascend vp into the heauenly

enioy all that can bee desired in a happy and contented life, who can now interrupt our quiet, and trouble our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity? and not deferre it to vncertaine dayes, and lay it vpon dangerous hazards.

Goe you Princes, propound vnto your selues these haughty hopes of glory, but expect nothing but smoake: flatter not your selues in your fortunes, she is treacherous; the more shee smiles, the more she is to bee feared. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:3718:284"/>

                  <p>Also the glory of the Sunne is one, the glory of the Moon <note place="margin">1.

These are wonderfull things, but what assurance? the Spirit of God doth assure thee, if
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:3718:285"/>
thou beest of God; for God doth seale vp an earnest pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 22</note> of his holy Spirit in their hearts that are his, as the Apostle teacheth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the soule be immortall, the body must one day rise immortall, to the end, that this soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created for the body, may giue it life againe being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united. Moreouer (as Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> teacheth) it is the order and cause of Iustice; <note place="margin">De fid. resur rect, c. 19</note> seeing that the work of man is common to the body and soule, and what the soule doth fore-thinke, the body effects; and therefore it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that both should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in iudgement, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue either punishment or glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Iesus Christ is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:3718:285"/>
for vs, and to assure vs that by the same diuine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer that hath drawne him out of the graue, we also shal be raised. I proue the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent by aboue 500. witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 6</note> which at one time haue seene Iesus Christ, liuing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had beene crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Iewes, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sheweth: and <hi>Ioseph</hi> also who was a Iew, doth witnesse it, <hi>lib.</hi> 18. c. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities. He was seene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely by women, beleeued by the incredulous: and for a ful assurance thereof, hee would (contrary to the nature of his body, which aspired nothing but heauen) conuerse forty dayes vpon earth: Heere is reason sufficient in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith, whereas reason should yeeld her selfe priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:3718:286"/>
and yet to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare visibly, and to free all doubt, God would both in the ancient and new alliance raise vp some that were seene and admired of the people. So <hi>Lazarus</hi> being called out of his graue, was beheld of all men, and the malicious Pharisies tooke counsell to put him to death as well as Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>The same God would ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest a plot of the future Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection to his Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel,</hi> when as he had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him into a field full of <note place="margin">Ezech. 37.</note> drye bones; which when hee had seene, and prophesied o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>As for this point which concernes an article of our faith, the Resurrection of the flesh, the Obiector dares not deny, but there is matter suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in this world to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish for the restoring of all the dead bodies; not since an imaginary Eternity, (for we are now vpon tearmes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, whereof wee must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the principles, and not question them,) but from the first man vnto the last that shall be: Herein there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that inuolues contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                  <p>The other point was, that
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:3718:287"/>
suppose the eternity of the world, after the reuolution of all things, and the encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the same order in all points that is at this present, there shall bee the same Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, the same creatures, and the same men that are at this present: this also hath no implicity, seeing we affirm not, that all things, the same creatures, which haue bin &amp; shalbe for euer, shalbe restor'd together at one instant, but by degrees, and euery one in his turne. Behold how this first matter perisheth not, and is not reduced to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but flowes dayly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der new formes. This matter is bounded, the starres and the heauen which roule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, make it to bring forth creatures continually,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:3718:287"/>
and man sometimes; but by some rare constellation, as the Naturallists speake. The heauens, I say, are bounded, and their motions limited: Wherefore I maintaine, it is not impossible, that in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of time, that which is limited and bounded, and hath once met and is ioyned, may yet againe meete and be reioyned: if we consider that it is not by chance, but by fatall necessity: that this Vniuerse roules without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; as al they among the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> which haue had any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: Yea one of them said, that who so would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande proofes thereof; must be answered with a whip: but behold a most certaine proof; all creatures, euen those that
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:3718:288"/>
haue no vnderstanding, tend alwayes to their ends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and all encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in one vniuersall end: If there were not a certaine prouidence in the world, which prescribes to euery creature that end which it knoweth not, and makes it containe it selfe; the world should not be a world, that is to say, a most excellent and well ordained composition, but the greatest confusion that could be imagined. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that the heauens in their motions, the starres in their coniunctions, the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in their order, euen vnto the last, may encounter toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so those things which wholly de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="545" facs="tcp:3718:288"/>
in Physicks, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Agent haue such power after the death, and destruction of the creature, as they had during his life: what then can hinder it but by the position of the same causes, and the same circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of time concurring, the same effect may be repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, the thing which is no more, is no farther from being then that which hath not bene; and there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility but that which hath had no being, may come to light; neither is ther any repugnancy but that which hath bene once liuing, may come againe to life; yea, and who knowes whether that which is now, hath not beene often heretofore? I
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:3718:289"/>
should beleeue it, if I did giue credit to the eternity of the world. As for the similitude of clay, which the Obiect or (not vnderstanding me) doth presse so strongly, it is very fit in this matter: for the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which hath made a man, and then hath wrought it to make a horse, and then confounded it to make an ape, and in the end an Eagle; may if hee please, returne and make the same man which he had made first; and hauing vndone it, may make a horse, and so consequently one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an other <hi>in infinitum,</hi> not that hee can make them all foure subsisting at one time, therein the Obiector fights with his shadow, and not with my saying.</p>
                  <p>And to demonstrate the
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:3718:289"/>
power of Nature turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her circle, &amp; returning backe to the point where she had begun, and passing ouer all the circumference of the circle, to repaire that in place and time which she had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued; shee would leaue for an earnest penny, the Phenix, the only bird of his kinde, which is seene in <hi>Arabia;</hi> and which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in their Hierogliphicall letters pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to describe by his long continuance, the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the soule. This goodly birde after many ages past, to renew himselfe, casts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon a pile of stickes layd together, the which hee doth so beate with his wings, and with the helpe of the Sun, which hangs perpedicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ouer him, as it takes fire,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:3718:290"/>
and consumes the body: out of which springs a little worme, and of that a little birde; which being couered with feathers, in the end flies away, and becomes the same Phenix. You will question the truth hereof, if the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not as much or more in the silke-worme, whose egge is no bigger then a graine of millet; it discouers a little woolly worme, the which without dying trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes it selfe into a moth, &amp; that changeth into a flie which hath scales, and this becomes a butterflie, which beating it selfe continually layes egges; of these egges come little wormes, and so consequently by an infinite circulation.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore these diuerse

The soule is a plant transported from heauen into a strange soyle, into a body of earth, where it sighs, pines away, and desires to depart.</p>
               <p>The greatest thing in the world (sayth <hi>Periander)</hi> is contayned in a litle space: <hi>Socrates</hi> maintained, that the true man was that within, which is lodged in the body as in an Inne.

But S. <hi>Paul</hi> shewes it better then all these; If this earthly lodging be destroied, if this bodie returne to ashes, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.</note> we haue a mansion with God. And the body is the clothing of the soule, the which <hi>Esop</hi> obiected to one who abused the beautie of his body: He are my friend, sayd he, thou hast <note place="margin">Max. ser. 44.</note> a faire garment: but thou put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test it off ill.

<pb n="554" facs="tcp:3718:293"/>
is the rider: if the horse be lame, blind orresty, sayth one, the rider is not in fault. The bodie is a ship, the spirit the Pilot, the ship suffers wracke, but the Pilote saues himselfe by swimming, or vpon some boarde, the body dies, the soule saues it selfe vpon the table of faith and repentance. The bodie is a Lanterne, the soule the Candle; if the glasse be cleare and transparent, the light is the greater: so by the disposition of the body, the soule is knowne more or lesse. Man is a bird shut vp in the shell of the egge, expecting vntill the shell breake of it selfe that he may come forth; so doth, the soule that the body my be broken, to the ende shee may flie to heauen.</p>
               <p>There are three places
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:3718:293"/>
assigned to man, the first is the matrix, the second is this world, &amp; the third is heauen; the first is short, the second a litle longer, and the third is without ende: In the first he cries at the comming forth, for that he is ignorant of the goodly spectacle of the world which God (as a table coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with all sorts of meate in a great Hall) hath prepared for him: In the second, hee apprehends and desperatly feares his departure, for that he knowes not this third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the seate of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> of the Angells, and of the blessed, which is prepared for him, infinitely more excellent then this base earth; where he shall remaine euerlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perfectly happy. And these are the liuely simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:3718:294"/>
with many other like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, which are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the mouthes and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of such as treate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly thereof; whereby man may see that he hath no subiect to feare death, seeing that by it his soule, his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part, and by which hee is man, receiues so great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifit: And what shall it bee when the holy Ghost shall assure his Spirit, that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being layd in the ground, as in a sacred pawne, shalbe restored to him immortall, in the great and last day?</p>
               <p>But attending this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable good, let vs proue this immortality byreason; &amp; first of all: The soule reuiues, and fortifies it selfe in the greatest agonies of death. So Testators witnesse, that
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:3718:294"/>
they are sound in minde, though very sicke in body: so the disposition of a man at the point of death is of more weight, for that hee hath a better conscience, &amp; a more liuely feeling of his soule. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> giues aduice <note place="margin">Lib. 1. de prognost.</note> to obserue, if in diseases there appeare nothing that is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine: meaning that we should obserue the sighes, and the gestures of the sicke patient; for if they be vnaccustomed of heauen, or of God, it is a signe that the soule begins to discouer it selfe, seeing it thinkes of heauen her proper mansion. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> (being in the bed of death) caused his children to approach vnto him; to whom hee gaue <note place="margin">Xenoph. lib. 8.</note> goodly admonitions; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others hee told them,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:3718:295"/>
that hee could neuer bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that the soule lying in the body did remaine after the death of the mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as if he would say, that vntill then he had studied to assure himself, but now he did not doubt of it. Nay, we shall sometimes see ignorant Countrimen, discourse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well at the point of death; as wee reade of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine labourer altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, being nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The 2. is taken from reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and from the homage which man doth owe vnto God for the immortality of his soule; not in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try but in all; not in one age, but for euer; not in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but generally in all by some adoration, prayer, of sacrifice, in what fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on soeuer, man will sooner forget his King, his father, yea himselfe, then his God; yet hee makes no doubt but there is a King, he sees him, he knowes him, he honours him: and that he hath a father, of whom hee holds his life, and with whom he doth conuerse dayly, and whom he is bound to loue; finally, he tries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:3718:296"/>
growes conceited, and many times abuseth himselfe with the great loue of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and yet hee holds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe more bound to God, then to all these: hee will not feare to displease them, if he can no otherwise please God; and will hold for Maximes, That it is beter to obey God then men: that he which doth not renounce father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the loue of God, is not worthy of him: hee that doth not renounce himselfe, and take vp the Crosse of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction for the seruice of God, deserues to bee renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of him. The vnciuill wars which haue swallowed vp so many men in Christendome, within these 50. yeares, had no other pretexts then these sentences; and they had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Let vs obserue it in some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, but great in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, being incensed for that the Iewes had denied him suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors, marcht with his Army to ruine them, if the high Priest <hi>Iaddus</hi> with his orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his holy troupe, had not gone out to meete with <hi>Alexander:</hi> Who when he saw the high Priest, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired him, and fell downe at his feete; whereat his people were amazed, and troubled, and his most confident <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio</hi> came vnto him: How comes it, sayth he, since that
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:3718:297"/>
you worship a man, you whom althe earth is ready to acknowledge for a God? It is not hee (answered <hi>Alexander)</hi> but God in him, whom I worship, who appeared to me in vision in the like habit in <hi>Macedon.</hi> Whence came this suddaine forgetfulnesse of his owne reuenge, &amp; from whence this acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Immortall? but from an immortall soule. As <hi>Antiochus</hi> held <hi>Ierusalem</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged, the feast of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles drew neere, &amp; the Iewes being resolued to celebrate it, they sent an Embassage vnto him, to demaunde a truce for seuen dayes, that they might attend the holy worship of their great God. The soule of this great King being toucht with religion,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:3718:297"/>
not only yeelded to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but also hee himselfe turned to this homage, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed oxen with gilded hornes to bee conducted to the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie gates, with great store of Indense, and sweet smells to be sacrificed. In which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whether should we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire most, either the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this great King, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and deuoutly hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ready victory?

               <p>And what doth not this confused apprehension of God worke in the immortall spirit of man? <hi>Cybels</hi> Priests wil geld themselues, thinking to please their goddesse; the

Hath she planted a vehement desire of immortality, the chiefe point of her excellency? hath shee giuen her a taste in this miserable life, to leaue her altered for euer?</p>
               <p>The fourth is from the continual action of the soule which neuer takes rest day nor night, like vnto the Sun: sleepe doth not shut her eies as it doth the bodyes, neither by consequence, death.

his rest, when as the vapours of his disgestion fuming vp into the braine, trouble it; but after mid-night, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at the point of day:

               <p>The fifth.

               <p>The sixth complaint of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> (of nature as of a step-mother) seemes most iust, to haue giuen a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g life to no end, to certain creatures; and to haue denied it vnto man, who might therby haue attained vnto wisedome, the greatest good in this world, if the soule dyed with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for then onely we beginne to be wise when wee dye, and many times were preuented by death: But nature hath done nothing but most wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and therefore shee hath satisfied this complaint ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

way.</p>
               <p>The seuenth is drawne from mans conscience, which being good makes Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to lift vp her head by the feeling of another life; and to looke down for an offence by the apprehension of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture iudgement.</p>
               <p>There is no light so cleere, nor testimony so glorious, as when truth shines in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the spirit is seene in truth, saith Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi>

               <p>On the other side, there is nothing that doth more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and torment then a bad conscience. Let the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute wretch that is, come, and I will make him confesse in some sort howsoeuer;

                  <p>Hitherto <hi>Huart,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth confirme; for we see that as a man doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance in age, he growes in wisedome; and Iesus himselfe made true man, aduanced in wisedome and stature. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, age declining, the

                  <p>To the 3. If the soule bee mortall, it followeth not that nature hath made any thing in vaine; if she hath hope or feare to be immortall, it is to encourage it to vertue, that

is to say, to the preseruation of that goodly order, and to terrifie it from the infraction thereof, if she dies, her alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the immortality dries away.

                  <p>The life is long if it be full, and it is full when the spirit affects her good, and tranfers her power to her selfe.

And moreouer

If he think that the immortalitie of the soule cannot be grownded sollidly vpon any humaine argument, let him also thinke that there cannot instance be giuen to the contrarie, which is not easily ouerthrowne, so as he bring a spirit that is tractable &amp; not preiudicate. And aboue all, that hee doe not perswade him-selfe that he may see it or feele it, as the smoake or heate going out of the fire, so the soule going out of the bodie; for it is a spirit, and therefore not possible to be comprehended but by reason and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,

                  <p>It seemes the Obiector takes an ill presage of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallitie of the soule; for that she is fauourable: as if it were not the nature of man (if he be not brutish) to court those things which are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy &amp; excellent, as the soule of man is aboue al the world. All men applaude men in great authoritie; we esteeme pretious things, as siluergold Pearle: what a sot or rather a madd man is he, that will haue a concoit that the thing is not excellent, because it is respected? As for the 400. Prophets, they spake vnto the King according to humaine sence, and were found false; <hi>Micheas</hi> according to the

He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires in the end (or makes a shew to desire it) that wee should ballance our reasons. I am content, and I protest it will be to his confusion; for the Father of light will not suffer Satan the father of lies to triumph ouer the truth. For the first instance then we say, that <hi>Huart</hi> doth not meane the soule by the vnder standing, but the intellectual spirits, whereof she hath need to argue and to vnderstand the things of this world, and to write worthily; and these

thousand; it proceeds, say you from nature and institution. I answer, it is from nature only that she takes her beginning; education doth manure it &amp; better it; but what doe you vnderstand by nature? For the Philosophers haue beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to signifie 4. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct things by the same name, which yet symbolize together; the lowest is the temperature of the 4. humors in the body of man: The 2. is the soule which giues motion vnto the body; The 3. is the ordinance and rule which God hath established in the world: The 4. is God himself, called by some in that regard nature naturant.

As for the principall
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:3718:313"/>
foundation, it is common to men and women; the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are diuers: Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is greater in men, and feare in women. Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth stirre vp the will to the seruice of God by two considerations; the one is of the diuine power &amp; bounty, to haue had wil and power to giue life, when as wee dreamt not of it; to haue drawne vs out of endlesse dangers, and to haue continued the course of his graces, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding our ingratitude. The other consideration is, from the basenesse, and weakenesse of man, which makes him to feele his imperfections, and to repaire vnto the fountaine of all good: feare doth stirre vp to humilitie, to contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, to confession of
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:3718:313"/>
mouth, and to satisfaction by works. The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedom, sayth the wise man. Man then being raysed a degree higher then woman in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, if he doth vse his knowledge rightly, submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himselfe wholy to God, hee shall be much more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to his seruice, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Disciple which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> loued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the rest: but for that they are ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> puft vp they abuse it, for pride is a spiritual poyson which spoyles all, as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Belzebub;</hi> &amp; therefore most of our learned men are not so religious as women &amp; ignorant people, who being gouerned by a moderat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, doe husband with all humilitie their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:3718:314"/>
knowledge of God; &amp; the affection in this feminine sexe is commonly more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous then in the other.</p>
                  <p>Finally, by the reuerence which is stronger in him, this sexe feares to offend God, and to make the holy Ghost heauy, by whom he is sealed vntill the day of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speakes: it is not feare onely then that begets religion, for then Deere, Conies, and other fearefull Creatures should bee more religious.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, it is no generall rule that women are more religious, if it bee not at this time, which is as barren in deuout men, as it is fertill in many religions: for wee shall finde as many men recorded for Martyrs as women; and

And if the Elephant doth therein seeme to imitate man, they are but shewes and gesticulations, hauing no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion in the heart, which is the essence of religion: and what hee doth, is by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of his owne temper, which approcheth neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of man; And what doth <hi>Aelian</hi> &amp; others report so memorable of him, but that hee turnes vp his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>To the 3. The impostor sayth, that the soule is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a desire of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, to the end it may bee stirred vp to vortue: it is well spoken, for true vertue in this world, is the sole and true good of man, which makes him worthy of the heauenly beatitude, which layes hold of a vertuous soule; but this vertue without this immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is a poison to man, keeping him from running headlong to all carnall and vicious pleasures, so as they be delightfull; and as many Philosophers and men of God, as shall crie out against the riots of the flesh, they are so many tormenters: but the soule is immortal, and vertue

                  <p>Some beasts of pleasure, some birds for delight, are cunningly taken by men, to bee nourished daintily; the which in their taking will torment themselues more,

                  <p>The obiection to the 5. is his confirmation; for if man abused by his imagination, seeking the good encounters that which is bad, he is twise miserable in his dessignes &amp; in his euents.

<pb n="607" facs="tcp:3718:319"/>
hard to be performed. If ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue were not difficult to learne, to what end doth S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speake of so many Schoolemasters, so much se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity, rods, whips, and so much discipline? and why doth the holy Scripture say, that we must often whip the well-beloued child, lest hee should become stubborne? and then it will be hard, yea, impossible to tame him.</p>
                  <p>And farther, what signifie those notable punishments inuented by our Elders, the Scaffolds, gibbets, strapados, wheeles, fires, and others, but that such seuerity is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to suppresse the sury of man to vice?</p>
                  <p>Finally, there is nothing so difficult as vertue, saith <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2, Ethi. e. 3</note> But that which is worst
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:3718:320"/>
of all, when we thinke after a thousand crosses to haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to this throne of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, what a combate doe wee feele in our selues, seeking to put it in execution? now wee will, and instantly wee will not the same thing. What a monster is this, saith S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> and whence comes it? <note place="margin">Consess. l. 8. c. 9</note> If the spirit commands the body, it presently obeyes: but if he commands himself, hee findes nothing but resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: and in the chapter following, I had disposed my selfe, saith hee, after a good resolution to serue my God and Lord; it was I that wold, and I that would not: I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had an absolute will, nor a full power to resist; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had a battaile within me, and was diuided within
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:3718:320"/>
my selfe, and this diuision happened in despite of me. Hitherto S. <hi>Augustine:</hi> that good man so fashioned to vertue, confesseth to be in a continuall warre, and where there is war there is no peace nor rest.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer wee must not wonder at these rodomonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does of the <hi>Stoicks;</hi> they haue spoken others more strange, but more vnsauory.

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:3718:321"/>
the fulnesse of folly: There is something, saith <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Epist. 53.</note> wherein a wise man sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth God; he is wise by the benefit of nature, not by his owne: a strange case, to haue the imbecility of man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the assurance of God. So <hi>Crysippus</hi> both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently and flatteringly, compared <hi>Dion</hi> of <hi>Syracusa</hi> to <hi>Iupiter</hi> his soueraigne God, and maintained that he was not inferiour vnto him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in knowledge nor in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p>These are goodly fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, or rather frenzies, I will aduise such people not to take <hi>Elleborum,</hi> nor to purge, or neuer to awake out of their doting dreames: for being in health or awake, they shall finde themselues naked and
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:3718:321"/>
miserable; like vnto the mad page, who thought himselfe to be the greatest Emperour in the world, &amp; that all Kings were his vassalls, and did him hommage: but beeing cured, he found himselfe to be only but a poore Page, and bound the next day to serue him whom hee would not haue accepted (beeing sicke) for his lacquay.</p>
                  <p>In the sixth obiection hee auerres, that <hi>Solon</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined how hard it was to please all.</p>
                  <p>I answer. That <hi>Solons</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was to speake of man to man, whereas the defectiue worke is often censured by a weake braine: but of God it is otherwise, his worke is so excellent, as there is not any thing but is admirably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:3718:322"/>
and not to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured in any point, but by fooles; And if man had not in his soule another life, then this terrestriall, the most resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned brains would be to seek, for that man the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Creatures, is of no more continuance; but hee doubts of this proposition. Hee doubts of that which all the world hold for certaine: if the Phenix in his first bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and in his sole <hi>Indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum</hi> be strange, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes not but that there may be such a bird, most rare, and very long liued. Moreouer, the Stagge found in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of <hi>Senlis,</hi> during the reigne of <hi>Charles</hi> 6. whereof <hi>Belle forrest</hi> makes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Admit wee should take the computation, from the

time that the Emperors reig ned in France, yet should we finde fiue hundred yeares, which is the age they giue vnto a Stagge. As for the Ralien, <hi>Virgil</hi> assignes him <note place="margin">Alipicem Cervum ter vincit Corvus.</note> much more age. He thinkes hee hath well satisfied when hee saith, that it is natures sport to make exception in generall rules: For as true as it is in matters indifferent, of small donse quence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is found excepted from the generality; so is it as false in matters of great consequence, and which turne to great harme.</p>
                  <p>I will then that the diuine prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce be obserued, spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it selfe to make Lawes, and to giue exemptions, that all beasts haue the ends of

their haire bending towards the taile, and that the Origes is exempt, hauing it towards the head: that all beasts can moue their eares, and not man: that whatsoeuer flies hath feathers, but the Batte hath none. Finally, that all things in the world are in perpetuall motion, the earth not.</p>
                  <p>But what doth this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? But for the last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which God would haue for the great good of the earth:

                  </p>
                  <p>As it is in the 104. <hi>Psalme.</hi> But man if hee haue nothing
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:3718:323"/>
but this life, he hath need of a very long life: Who shall see and iudge of this goodly frame, this goodly order of the world, but man the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest workmanship of nature? and how can he doe it but by along life? he doth not equall nor exceede the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the celestiall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, before they bee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their first point; moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which giue life to euery thing by their diuers cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

How can he in his soule get wisedome, so necessary for the conduct of life, seeing that vse engenders it, and memory brings it forth, as <hi>Afranius</hi> saith, if by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of yeeres hee gets not the vse and experience of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affaires inuolued in this world?

preserue his bodily heath, or restore it beeing decayed, if he haue not the knowledge of Phisicke, seeing it is a long arte, and life is short? saith <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, he lightly passeth ouer the last and strongest reason of conscience, for that I assure my selfe his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did bely, his pen; and therefore hee will entertaine vs with a certaine instinct of the vnreasonable creatures, which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludes in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be Conscience.</p>

                     <hi>Answer.</hi> Creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason and without tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, are skilfull from their first being, in that which is profitable vnto them, to affect it, seeke it, and finde it; and to abhorre and flye from that which is hurtfull: and in

But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is a diuine vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in the soule (which S. <hi>Paule</hi> calls the spirit of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.) which applyes the knowledge of our spirit to the worke, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing <note place="margin">To. 1. quaest, 79. art. 13.</note> for vs, or against vs, of that which wee know wee haue done, or not done; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of growes the prouerbe, That

<pb n="653" facs="tcp:3718:342"/>
that among the <hi>Pagans,</hi> such as held the soule to bee mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, caused the doores to bee hanged close shut vpon their graues, and of this sort there are many noted.</p>
                  <p>The Philosopher <hi>Aristoxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> (by the report of <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius)</hi> durst maintaine that the <note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 13.</note> soule of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was nothing, yea, during the time shee was in the body; but as the strings of an instrument being tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned make an accord, so in mans body, the gathering together of the bowells, and the vigour of the members, produce all that harmonie which appeares in man.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Saduces</hi> in the Church of God, haue denied the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the foule. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara</hi> wife to the Emperour <hi>Sigismond,</hi> in the yeare 1400.
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:3718:343"/>
derided her women for that they praied and fasted, saying, that they must liue merily, and imbrace all pleasures, for that after death the soule did perish with the body; And many at this day shew by their liues, that only for ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and outward honesty, they must confesse the soule to be immortall.</p>
                  <p>And what a great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is it to beleeue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inwardly? <hi>Du Bartas</hi> in his Triumph of faith speakes of one:</p>

                     <l>I meane that Monster Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus hight,</l>

And he addes that this killing of-spring hath past to <hi>Rome,</hi> from thence into <hi>France,</hi> and that it buddes forth in the Courts of Kings, in seates of Iustice, and in the Church; finally, there are scarce any other impes that put forth at this day: to haue no God, and the soules to be mortall, are held equall things.</p>

<pb n="656" facs="tcp:3718:344"/>
full: But to answere cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically, I deny the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the proposition: It is true, there hath beene such a one, who hath doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether hee were a man; witnesse the Philosopher <hi>Pyrrhon,</hi> who makes professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to doubt all, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that whatsoeuer wee thinke to be, say, or do, is but by an vncertaine opinion. Moreouer, you shall finde some one so wounded in the imagination, by the force of some deepe melancholy, as he hath thought himselfe to be transformed into a wolfe, and also hath gone out of his house by night, howling and imitating the actions of <note place="margin">Vuierus l. 4. c. 23.</note> a wolfe; the which bred the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of becoming wolues. In like manner I say, that the
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:3718:344"/>
darke fumes of voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the depraued humours of wickednesse, may also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow the vnderstanding of some men, and make them doubt of that which they would not vnderstand, the immortality of the soule; least that the apprehension of an eternall iudgement, should trouble their carnall pleasures.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> hee hath also doubted whether he were a man, since that hee tooke vpon him a womans habit among his Courtisans, and handled a distaffe with them. For my part I beleeue that he had the humour and spirit of a beast; as <hi>Tully</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> hauing <note place="margin">Lib. 5. Tus.</note> read this Epitaphe, sayd that they should haue written it
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:3718:345"/>
vpon the pit of a beast, not on the graue of a King: The same answere shall serue for the like thing pretended at <hi>Brescia.</hi> As for the third, their ignorance and malice would force a beleefe of mortality of soules; what others more honest and more wise haue done, shall serue to confute them: For the same antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries write, that many caused to bee drawne vpon their tombes, doores halfe open, shewing thereby that their soules escaped from the tombe. If one Philosopher would dispute of it, there are others, who to get fame haue questioned matters more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent; as <hi>Cardan,</hi> the fourth Element of fire; <hi>Copernicus:</hi> the motion of heauen, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by the illusion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:3718:345"/>
that it is the earth &amp; not the heauen that moues: There haue beene alwayes and shall be such fantasticke humors, who would make themselues famous, with the preiudice of the truth.</p>
                  <p>As for the Empresse <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bara,</hi> hee should haue added that shee was an insatiable Letcher; &amp; therefore she had great interest, (not to giue an accoumpt of her dissolute life,) to perswade her self that al was extinguished in death. Now followeth this depra ued age, into the which as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottome of a sinke, al the filth of precedent ages haue seemed to run; yet there are (God bee thanked) who beleeue it in their hearts, and deliuer it with ther mouthes, that their spirit is immortal,
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:3718:346"/>
and they that speake it only with their mouthes, it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that naturall shame will not suffer them to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the villany of thier hearts; and this bashfulnesse (an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of God) is sufficient to make them inexcusable in the great day of the Lord. Moreouer, they that with a furious impudency haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued that the soule died with the body, haue for the most part in their miserable ends made knowne the iudgements of God, who pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished them for their frantike opinion; as <hi>Lucian,</hi> who was torne in pieces by dogs; <hi>Lucre tius</hi> who grown mad, cast him selfe downe a precipice: <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula</hi> who was cruelly slaine; with infinite others: Or else they haue shewed it in their
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:3718:346"/>
confused and irresolute car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the distemperature and trouble of their soules im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning their damnable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; As for <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> and the swarme of his disciples, who in a manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone hold the chaires in all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, I will suffer them to be led in Triumph before the triumphant chariot of faith: that which <hi>Du Bartas</hi> sayth in the beginning of the second song, is sufficient to confound them.</p>

               <p>They may againe obiect, That God with his owne hands had moulded and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoned the first man, who not with standing is dead. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that God was the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and immediate cause of
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:3718:348"/>
man, but not the formall nor the materiall; his substance was the slime of the earth, which might be dissolued; his forme was his soule, which might be separated: But in the soule, and of the soule of man, God holds immediatly the foure kinds of causes; the efficient, for he hath made it of himselfe, without any help; the materiall, not that it is of his essence, but that hee hath created it of nothing, as hee did the world: the formall in like manner, his continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration retaines it, as his continuall prouidence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues the world from ruine; and therefore <hi>Christ</hi> sayd, my Father works hitherto, and I with him. Finally, he is the finall cause for man liues to know and serue God. If they

reply againe, that God being a voluntarie cause in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, should not be numbred among the naturall causes, which necessarily produce their effects, if there be not some let: that is most certen; but where the word of God is euident, we must not doubt of his will; but it is apparent in the passages alledged, that the soule is immortall. And therefore we may profitably and safely conclude, That if from the sufficient and neere cause the effect doth necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie flow, and that this effect doth continue as long as the cause, if there happen no lets: that vndoubtedly the soule is immortal, seeing that God her most sufficient cause, and who feares no disturbance, is immortall; so as to denie this

                  <p>Fifthly, the soules are prest at the departure from their bodyes, to yeeld an account of their administration in this life, vndergoing a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular iudgement.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS the soule of man is the Image of God, so the face is the Image of the soule, and therefore the Eternall creating the soule of man, did breathe it <note place="margin">Genes. 2,</note> in his face, which the holy Ghost cals respiration of life: so the property of man is to paint in his face by his diuers colours, the diuers affections of his soule. Wisedome, saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> cleeres the face of man, and his fierce and sowre <note place="margin">Eccles. 8.</note> aspect is changed. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines haue called it <hi>vultus,</hi> for that the will is read in the forehead: the manners of the soule follow the humours of the body, saith <hi>Gallen;</hi> and if some one belies his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is a maske which hee
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:3718:354"/>
puts on, and therefore <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> did vniustly blame God, for that hee had not made man with an open heart. Thereon is all the Art of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siognomie grounded, an Art (which without this faining) euery man would learn with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out teaching.</p>
               <p>By the face that <hi>Diuiner Egyptian,</hi> familiar to <hi>Marc. Anthony,</hi> did know the diuers dispositions of men. These markes of the face, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed with the seale of the soule: and hee that will not iudge by such markes ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, of the brightnesse and immortality of the soule, is without iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Homer</hi> writes that <hi>Vlisses</hi> hauing escaped from ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, was graciously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and reuerenced by

the <hi>Pheagues,</hi> hauing no orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then, but this vertue &amp; generous disposition, the beauty &amp; excellency where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appeared in his fore-head. Man in like sort carries on his fore-head the markes of his immortal soule: Wherof the first is the carrying his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance straight vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, proper to man, at all times, to him alone, and to all the generation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde; which shewes his be ginning to bee celestiall and immortall: for that onely is perishable which is vnder the region of the Moone, &amp; whatsoeuer is aboue it, is not subiect vnto destinie.</p>
               <p>The 2. is that foresight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off, those beames, I say, cast farre and wide by the piercing sight, without stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

vpon that which doth touch it, or enuiron it neere; which shewes that the flight of the soule must go farre. If any one say, that certaine birds, &amp; foure footed beasts see farre; but it is not to the same end, for man doth it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the pleasure of the sight, &amp; to obserue the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his celestial habitation: whereas other creatures are sharpe sighted either to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue their enemies, &amp; to flie from them; or to looke after their prey, to deuour it: not to heauen, to obserue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and to send vp thither by the beames of their sight, their most ardent vowes, as man alone doth.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this farre fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sight of man, is a noble signe of his spirituall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:3718:355"/>
which vniting the time past to the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, doth alwayes casts her goodly thoughts vpon the future.

him the diuine character, the breathing of the mouth of God, the liuely Image of the liuing God, who giues him a royalty ouer all creatures; who terrifies them with his onely looke, puts them to flight by his bare words, and makes them obey and serue by his commandement: And if at any time they make shew to reuenge themselues, they are either prest on by famine, or thrust on by feare to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their liues; or else God would haue it so by reason of the sinnes of man.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IT seemes that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the preaching of the soule in her exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption from the graue, flowes originaly for that she vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds immortal things, &amp; that by the ioyning of time past with the present she infers the future; wherein she is chiefely distinguished from beasts which are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: but this ground-worke is not sollid. Some one spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the soule, to shew her immortalitie, saith, that they
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:3718:359"/>
did not iudge her eternall, for that no man could compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Eternitie, that is to say, that long terme past without beginning: If this be admitted, the question is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, and the soule will be found mortall, seeing that she cannot perfectly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the immortalitie; for it is as difficult to conceaue a continuitie to come without end, as it is of that which is past without beginning. More ouer the difference of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable man, hath no aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by his continuance ouer beasts, seeing that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is but an accident, and beasts are not longer liued then trees, yea shorter, yet are they are as much aboue trees, as men are aboue beasts. Thirdly they whom
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:3718:359"/>
we wholy follow, as <hi>Aristotle,</hi> (that myracle of the world) <hi>Gallen</hi> the first fauorite of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> surnamed the diuine, and others, haue spoken doubtfully, or denyed it flatly; <hi>Gallen, Aristoxenus</hi> and <hi>Dicearchus Aristotles</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples, yea and <hi>Plutarke</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe do witnesse, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> denyed it: <hi>Hippocrates</hi> sayd, that the soule went alwayes on vnto death.</p>
                  <p>Finally, if she be of heauen and immortall, why doth she not participate of heauen &amp; immortalitie? why are her thoughts fixt vpon earth and perishable things? The plant retaines something of the soyle, what hath the soule of heauen?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> Mans vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding comprehends in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

fashion a continuance without end, and for proofe, giue him a terme of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Millions of yeares: hee will extend his spiritual sight an hundred Millions beyond that; and if you will, as farre beyond it, for that this visible force cannot be in any sort limited by time. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens and starres in their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance shall continue without end, yet in their quallities they must change; but the soule doth well comprehend this continaunce. Moreouer it is no good consequence to say, Bulls feele not the vigour of their force, therefore they haue none. A man being borne and bred in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of a darke caue, thinks that he hath no facultie to see, is he the therefore blinde?
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:3718:360"/>
the soule being buried in the darkenesse of a mortall body as in a graue, sees not her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, hath she therfore none? Thirdly, we doe not say that man is immortall, for that he differs from beasts, but for many reasons deliuered &amp; to be deliuered. Fourthly, the Philosophers aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned would see and touch the soule in her immortalitie, &amp; she is not subiect to any sence S. <hi>Basile</hi> hath seene it in spirit <note place="margin">Lib. 2. de anima.</note> &amp; written it with his hand: The soule, sayth he, cannot be seene with eyes, for that she is not illuminated by any colour, nor hath any figure or corporal character. <hi>Aristotle</hi> knew it whengoing out of the fabrike of corporall nature, hee sayd that it was not the charge of a Physition to treat
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:3718:361"/>
of all sorts of soules, as is the intellectuall, which hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth to differ from the sensitiue &amp; vegetatiue, from which, he sayth, shee may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate her selfe, as the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall from the corruptible. <hi>Gallen</hi> had his eyes fixed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon the body (the subiect of Phisick) and therefore hee sayd freely, that it did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him in his arte, if hee were ignorant how the soules were sent into the bodyes, or whether they past from one to an other; But if it please <hi>Gallen,</hi> leauing the limites of his arte, to take the fresh ayre of diuine Philosophy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently his goodly conception is followed with these words The soule is distilling from the vniuerfall Spirit, descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from heauen, &amp;c.</p>

Which hauing left the earth, recouers heauen, and dwells with the Moderator of all things in the Celestiall places. As for <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> his words sound more of the immortalitie, then of the death of the soule, hauing this sence, That the soule goes alwayes increasing vntil the death of the bodie. But if you desire effects and not words, what conceit could <hi>Aristotle, Gallen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> haue of the soule to bee mortall, who by an immortall labour haue purchased such great same throughout the world? and whose authoritie is the cause that they are now produced, and maintained?</p>
                  <p>Finally, that which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of the soules thoughts, fixed for the most part on
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:3718:362"/>
the fraile things of this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing world, it is no smal signe of the corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but no argument, that the soule is perishable, seeing she retaines still the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal seale which God hath set vpon her in her first creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                  <p>As for the Maxime, that there is no returning againe to the habite, it is abusiue not only to God, who can do all, but euen to nature, and to

Wherefore if corruption did
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:3718:369"/>
not generally possesse al men, she would suppresse this fear, reuerence her Creator, and do her duty vnto him; and then she should see that by that respectiue feare to offend her God, she should be fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from all other feare: shee should see, that fearing onely the death of the soule, (which is onely to be feared) shee should not feare that of the body, which is to be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

It is euen so of the soule; it is nourished in this corruptible life, by a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall meanes, and in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly by another, which is spirituall. But you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that the soule is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into the body; and not the infant into the wombe.

                  <p>Moreouer, it is not likely that in the Resurrection, the body which shall bee spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,

of the soule is the word of God: so they which haue had more feeling of this word, haue better acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it; as <hi>Zoroastres, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Trismegistes, Pithago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> surnamed the Diuine for that effect: but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle, Gallen,</hi> and others, who would measure all by humaine reason, haue won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully deceiued themselues in matters which exceeded this measure, as in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>If then the Obiector will beleeue this witnesse, of whom he cites a passage, the question will be soone ended: the holy Scripture sayth, that the Eternall breathed the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life into the nosestrills of <hi>Adam,</hi> he being framed of the slime of the earth; the
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:3718:380"/>
which is not spoken of any other creature: In <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes</hi> it is said, that the spirit returnes to God that gaue it: <hi>Iesus</hi> dying cryed out, Father into thy hands I commit my soule. Hee promiseth to the beleeuing theefe, that he shal be that day with him in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise;</hi> finally, S. <hi>Stephen</hi> dying made this prayer, Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> receiue my soule; with a thousand other passages.

<pb n="729" facs="tcp:3718:380"/>
And for this cause the infant is sayd to be the true sonne of his father and mother, from whom the bodie with his Organes proceeded; to make which perfect God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the spirit, so as this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is made for this bodie, and not the body for this spirit simply. Moreouer, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not ended, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the production of the forme or of the matter onely, but of all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed: therfore he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth or that ioynes the matter with the forme, the flesh with the soule, he doth truly ingender man.

Finally, that which made S. <hi>Augustin</hi> doubt of the generation of the soule, was, that hee could not comprehend how the sin which dwells in the soule of the father, doth pasfe vnto the sonne: But that is so plainely fet downe by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines at this day, as it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to speake of here, neither were it to the pourpose: It sufficeth that the Pagans themselues haue acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that the soule came into man otherwise then from

                  <p>IF the soule at the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the body, had her flight towards heauen, she would giue some signe of it to the body, stirring it with some speciall motion. Simple Creatures mooue themselues in all sorts of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, differing from plants, which without mouing from
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:3718:389"/>
their place, doe but grow vp and spread abroad, for that their soules are diuers: and why should not man, who hath a speciall soule, haue a speciall motion? As for that he bounds and skips, therein a goate or a cat hath more then hee; neither is that the reasonable soule that doth it, but rather the vegetatiue, the mixture of the naturall fire which raiseth him: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as soone as a man breathes and exhales: this fire, hee falls from his leape; but of any proper or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion of this flying soule, hee feeleth nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answere: Seruius</hi> vpon the 6. of <hi>Virgil</hi> will answer, That the soule in the body is like vnto a Lyon shut vp in a streight cage, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:3718:390"/>
loseth nothing of his force, although he cannot shew it; but if he once escape, you shal see him as strong as before, so as a man would thinke his force had bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in his prison. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, some haue bene so actiue as they haue flowne; as at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> in the yeare 1551. there was one vndertooke to flie from the Tower of <hi>Nefle</hi> vnto the <hi>Louure,</hi> the riuer being betwixt both, the King ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting him: and although hee could not get to the end of his enterprise, yet hee got vp into the aire after such an admirable manner, as hee came to the mid-way. But the flying of the Creature doth not proue his essence immortall, for then birds should be immortall. And
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:3718:390"/>
how then can the soules mount vp to heauen going out of the bodies? If thou doest beleeue the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Angells sent to serue them louingly which shall receiue the inheritance <note place="margin">Hebr. 1, 14</note> of saluation, will carry them as the Angell did poore <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus.</hi>

                  <p>Hereunto that good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Macarius</hi> had regard: There is a great Mistery, saith <note place="margin">Hom, 22, of the estate of them that die.</note> hee, accomplished in soules going out of the bodies; for if they bee guilty of sinne; troopes of diuells and bad angells flocking about them, seaze vpon those soules, as their slaues, and carry them away &amp;c. But if they bee in good estate, the companies of good Angells carrying them to a better life, present
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:3718:391"/>
them vnto the Lord; yet wee will not deny but in the soule there is an intrinsecall vertue to climbe vp to heauen, with a swiftnesse equall to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: if that fire hath a secret force to mount vp to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, being a dead Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what then shall the soule separated do, being so actiue, and so quicke, and whose proper Country is Heauen? And although that heauen, especially that which is the mansion of happy soules, bee so many leagues distant, as Astrologers which haue sought to take the height, haue found millions, &amp; being much amazed haue mounted neere to two thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d millions of leagues; yet we must not beleeue that the soule is long in passing
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:3718:391"/>
this great distance; for that her motion, not being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but diuided like to that of spirits, departing out of the body she is presently in heauen, euen as in this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible bodie, in a moment shee sends the beames of her sight and thoughts vp to heauen. But wholy to stoppe the mouth of our aduersarie, we say that the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the soule in her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie, is no humaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention, but a diuine reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Iustine Martyr</hi> sayth; and that since shee is fallen <note place="margin">Dial. cont Triph.</note> from her first integritie, which fall hath so amazed &amp; dulled her, as she knowes not truely what she hath beene, what she is, or where shee is, nor whither she shall goe, of whosesinne she is the subiect,
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:3718:392"/>
as Iron is of rust; it hath who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie spoyled her, dulled her quicknesse, and weakned her vigour; which is the cause that she stumbles in the way of health, is blynde in the knowledge of the least things &amp; is interrupted in the course of her brauest discourses by a flye or any toye: To conclude, shee is so troubled, as shee dreames of a thousand fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, &amp; in a manner mistakes euery thing.</p>
