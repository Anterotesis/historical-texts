            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

bene found that some disloyall and vnnaturall subiects haue
vntruely spread abroad sundry rumours and reportes, and
haue published diuers slaunderous pamphlets and seditious
libels, as well in this Realme as in foraine partes, in sundry
strange languages, in excuse and iustification of the sayde
Traytours so iustly executed, with purpose to defame her
Maiesties honourable course of iustice, so much as lyeth in
them, setting out those condemned persons as men of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
vertue and holines, and as her highnesse true, loyal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uote,

it very expedient, that as well certaine confessions taken of

certaine answeres lately made to certaine articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to those that were at that same time condemned
of high treason, but yet spared from execution, should bee
published truely &amp; sincerely, in such precise forme of words,
as the same haue bene acknowledged and subscribed, not
onely with the proper hands of certaine persons of publique
calling and credite that were present at their examination
&amp; haue subscribed thereunto, but also with the proper hands
of the offenders themselues, (Hart onely excepted) as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the Originals extant to be shewed, wherby it may be
most euidently seene, euen by them selues still persisting in
their most Trayterous affection, howe vntruely the said per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are reported to haue bene and to bee true and faithfull
subiects in matter of her Maiesties estate and Crowne, and
howe iustly they were condemned for treason and not for
points of religion, being those, that hauing bene by her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
clemencie so long spared vpon hope of repentance,
continue yet still in such Trayterous disposition of heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her highnes, two of them only nowe acknowledging
their true duetie of allegiance, though in pointes of religion
not reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled, as also one other named Edward Rishton, that
did before, openly at the barre at the time of the arraignment
(varying from Campion and the rest of his fellowes therin)
acknowledge his said duetie &amp; alleagiance to her Maiestie:
towards whom (to thend it may appeare vnto the worlde
that the said Campion &amp; the rest that were executed, were
not put to death for points that concerned matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
but for treason:) Her Maiestie doth meane to extend
her grace &amp; mercie, hoping that as it hath pleased God to
frame their consciences to acknowledge towards her that
<pb facs="tcp:7920:3"/>
duetie of allegiance that by the lawes of God and man they
owe vnto her as their most lawful prince and Soueraigne: so
hee will hereafter open their eyes to see, howe dangerously
they haue bene hitherto through false and erronious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
seduced, as well in matters concerning their dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
God, as in their alleagiance towards their Prince.
It is also looked for, that all such as make profession to bee
dutifull and well affected subiects, howsoeuer they be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in religion, seeing the most dangerous and pernicious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions

question, whether the Pope may for
any cause depose a prince: wherein his opinion
is, that for some causes he may lawfully depose a
prince, and that such a sentence ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed.</p>
               <p>To the second, he thinketh that in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
(as infidelitie or such like,) her Maiestie
is not to be obeyed against the Popes Bul and
sentence, for so hee saith he hath read, that the
Pope hath so done, <hi>de facto,</hi> against other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

hath such power, as is mentioned in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.</p>

<hi>Saunders,</hi> and Doctour <hi>Bristowe,</hi> might bee
deceiued in these poynts of their bookes, but
whether they were deceiued or not, he referreth
to God.</p>
