            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

doe giue their attendance, and lay before

little Casket of Iuorie, couered with an <hi>Agnus

or wounds with that knife, ſhal (by that act) releaſe
as many ſoules out of the fire of Purgatory.</p>
            <p>Then, deliuering it into the hand of the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer;
they vtter theſe words: Goe thou forth like
<hi>Iephtah;</hi> the ſword of <hi>Sampſon;</hi> the ſword wherby
<hi>Dauid</hi> did cut off the head of <hi>Goliah;</hi> the ſword of

of Setuſa, Imola, Fayenza, Furlie, Bologna, and
many other Citties: Goe thou forth (I ſay) be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
and God will ſtrengthen thine arme.</p>
            <p>After this, the helliſh company doe all fall
downe vpon their knees, and the moſt renouned
among them, or he that is the cheefe Prieſt, makes
the coniuration, ſaying theſe words that follow:
come Cherubins, come Seraphins, Thrones and
Dominations; come moſt bleſſed Angels, Angels
of charity; come and fill this holy vessell of glorie
and eternity, &amp; carry him forthwith to the crown
of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of Patriarkes and of Martyrs:
for he is no more one of ours, but he is yours.</p>
            <p>And thou, O great and powerfull God, that
haſt reuealed vnto him, in his prayer and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he muſt (of neceſſity) be the murtherer
of a Tyrant and Heretique, to giue his crowne to
a Catholique King, and he being (by vs) made apt
<pb facs="tcp:9320:5"/>
and diſpoſed vnto this murder: do thou fortefie his
ſenſes, and make bolde his courage, to the end,
that he may accompliſh thy will. Arme him with
a compleat Armour of thy prouidence, to eſcape
from them that would apprehend him. Giue him
winges, that the foule hands of the barbarous may
not touch his sanctified members. Spreade the
beams of thy ioyes vpon his ſoule, to the end that
thereby his body may bee ſo encouraged, that
cheerefully he may diſpoſe himſelfe to this fight,
without any feare.</p>
            <p>This coniuration being thus ended, they bring
him before an Altar, and there they ſhew him a
goodly picture, wherein the Angels doe beare
the body of <hi>Iames Clement</hi> the Iacobine Frier,

the doctrine whereof hath beene (by good right) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
by the Court of Parliament: some main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
that the doctrine contained in that booke,
was common to al the Ieſuites: Others, that it was
in ſuch ſort particuler to the Authour, as that many of
the ſelfe ſame company had written to the contrary,
and altogether had condemned it, in the body of the
Prouinciall congregation, ſome few yeares ſince.
A difference, which the leaſt paſſionate might deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
concluding, that diſallowance ſhould be the
reaſon, and that it muſt be attended, what we ſhould
ſay thereof.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, I hauing beene named in particuler,
this is the cauſe, Madame, that inſtantly made mée
ſet hand to pen, to repreſent vnto you, (as to her that
is equally affected to the true Religion, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed
in the good of this State, and the very ſafeſt
Sanctuarie that innocence can haue) that which the
Doctors of our company haue written vpon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.
Knowing, that the greatneſſe of affaires wil not
eaſily permit you, to looke into this caſe your ſelfe,
nor the little loue which thoſe detractors doe beare
vs, make any true report vnto you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9320:7"/>
After all this, I wil declare with the ſelfe ſame bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity,
what is the common ſenſe, and what is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of our Societie, diſperſed through the world
concerning the matter whereof queſtion is made.
They all preſuppoſing one verity, which cannot bée
called into controuerſie, no, not euen by the hatefull
and enuious of this flouriſhing Crowne: To wit,
that the ſubiect which was debated in the Councell
of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and which (ſince then) hath beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
more amply by our Catholique Doctors, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the expulſion of Tyrants: doth not any way
touch the happy renowne and moſt honourable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
of him whoſe death we deepely deplore, his
life hauing beene ſo farre from the detection of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
as it hath beene, and for euer ſhall bee to all the
Monarches in the world: the model of Piety, Iuſtice,
Clemency, Valour, Debonaritie, and Fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
towardes all his Subiects.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, the moſt Illuſtrous Cardinall
<hi>Tolet</hi> preſents himſelfe to our eyes, a perſonage of
rare knowledge, a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by Nation, and a <hi>French</hi>-man
in affection. In the firſt Booke of his Summe,
the ſixt Chapter, there he teacheth in expreſſe tearmes
that it is not lawful to attempt on the life of a Prince
although he doe abuſe his power. And addeth, that to
maintaine the contrary, is an heretical doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in the Councell of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt Illuſtrous and moſt learned <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
anſwering to the ſelfe ſame obiection, in the third
Chapter of his Apologeticall anſwere to the booke of
the King of great Brittaine ſpeaketh thus. I haue
neuer read, nor heard it ſaid, that eternall life ſhould
bee promiſed, to them that attempt on the life of
Kinges. But contrariwiſe I haue read, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
which ſaith: <hi>Euery Tyrant may and ought lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:9320:8"/>
bee ſlaine:</hi> was long ſince condemned in the firſt
Seſſion of the Councell of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> Very true it is,
that <hi>Iohn Wickliffe</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, hee whom the
Proteſtants doe praiſe ſo much, and of whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
they haue made a Placarde in the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpice
of their Hiſtories, teacheth: That he is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
a Lord, either Eccleſiaſticall or Ciuill, after the
one or other is fallen into any deadly ſinne. An er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
which the ſaid Councell condemned in the eight
Seſſion.</p>

and conforming himſelfe to the Doctrine of other

citeth the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and declareth the
fact of <hi>Aod</hi> on <hi>Eglon</hi> King of the <hi>Moabites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Or Ehud.</note> by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

               <hi>Sebaſtian Heiſſius,</hi> in his Apologeticall declaration
of Aphoriſmes, attributed to the Ieſuites doctrine,

<pb facs="tcp:9320:8"/>
out of his owne head, and that he himſelfe, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that he had exceeded the limites of the common
doctrine, did acknowledge, that he was ſubiect to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and he ſhould be ſubmitted to the cenſure of
whomſoeuer would accept it, immediatly after, his
opinion was brought, and the common cenſure of all

of the Prince of the Apoſtles, <hi>Seruants, be

               <hi>Nicholas Serier,</hi> writing on the third Chapter of

that the Act of <hi>Aod,</hi> neither can, or ought to ſerue, for
fore-iudging or example to deteſtable Aſſaſſinates,
<pb facs="tcp:9320:9"/>
Parricides, and murtherers of their Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Azor,</hi> in the ſecond part of his morall Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
the firſt booke, fift Chapter, and tenth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
ſhewes himſelfe a much greater enemie of the
audacious and ſacrilegious attentates, of ſuch as ſhal
enterpriſe vpon the liues of Princes, Inſtructing, that
it is not lawfull, to attempt on the liues of them that
doe vniuſtly poſſeſſe themſelues of ane State, Groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his ſaying principally vpon this; that no man
ought to be condemned, before he be heard, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowledge of the cauſe, in which caſe, any one
particular is no competent Iudge.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Lewes Richeome,</hi> his Apologies doe make
peremptory proofe of the vnreconcilable hatred, which
he beares to the doctrine of ſuch, as dogmatiſe againſt
the authority of Kings, And that in ſuch maner, as the
Lord <hi>Paſquire</hi> himſelfe, a criticke cenſurer of his
workes, after he hath reported his words in the third
booke and firſt Chapter, hee commendeth him, and
ſaith, that he cannot chuſe but loue him, adding theſe
words, <hi>I cannot chuſe but honor thee, beholding thee,
to portraite the Idea of obedience, which the Subiect
oweth to his King.</hi> A praiſe which hee might giue to
many other of the ſame Societie, who, after they had
examined this matter with Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> and the
whole Schoole, concluded all conformably to the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi>
and to that which hath béene determined in the
Councell of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such then being the ſenſe, and ſuch the ſentences
of theſe Doctors, very graue and ſignall men of our
company, what preiudice can the particular opinion
of <hi>Mariana</hi> bring to the reputation of a whole Order?
which Order being (according to her Inſtitution) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
iealous, for the manutention of thoſe holy
ordinances of the Church, and reſpecting the power
<pb facs="tcp:9320:9"/>
and authority of Kings, who, for their temporall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
doe depend onely vpon God: haue (of long time)
diſallowed the legertie of a drie penne, and namely
in the Prouinciall congregation of Fraunce, helde in
this Citie of Paris the yéere 1606. where moreouer,
the reuerend Father <hi>Claudius Aquanina,</hi> Generall of
our Company, was required, that ſuch as had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to the preiudice of the Crowne of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> might
be reprooued, and their Bookes ſuppreſſed, which the
ſaide Reuerend Father (afterward) did very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and exactly: being very ſorie, that by ouer-ſight
or negligence in his abſence, and without ſight of the
worke; any one ſhould preſume vpon his admittance.
The words which he vſeth in his anſwere, are theſe.
<q>We haue approued the iudgment and care of your
congregation, and haue béene greatly gréeued, that
no man will looke after the impreſſions of ſuch
Bookes: which Bookes neuertheleſſe, wée haue
ſuddainly commaunded to be corrected, and shall
haue moſt exact care hence-forwarde, that ſuch
things ſhall not happen any more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that very hardly now is to be found one onely
Copy of <hi>Mariana,</hi> except it be by the pernitious libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
of the inheritours of <hi>Wechell,</hi> who are knowne
to be of the pretended reformed Religion: and haue
cauſed the ſaid Booke to be imprinted at their owne
proper charges, not ſo much excited (as is eaſie to be
preſumed) by deſire to the publique ſeruice, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to hurt our Company. Some are of the mind,
that they haue added thereto ſomewhat of their own:
Others ſay, that thoſe Bookes of the firſt impreſſion
were much worſe, a controuerſie ſeruing to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
for albeit it were ſo, and that no man had lent
any charity, to this ill-handled penne: yet is there no
reaſon why it ſhould rather incommodate the body
<pb facs="tcp:9320:10"/>
of our Societie; then the writings of <hi>Iohn Petit,</hi> and
others, the Uniuerſities and Orders whereof they
were Schollers, Batchelers, Maiſters, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch, Madame, as I made promiſe in
the beginning, to expoſe clearely and diſtinctly what
our opinion and credence is, touching the matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
I come now to the point, which ſhall make vp
the laſt part of this declaration.</p>
            <p>1. All the Ieſuites in generall and particural, will
ſigne, yea, euen with their proper blood; that they do
not hold, either in this matter, or any other whatſoeuer,
any other faith, doctrine, or opinion, then that
of the whole vniuerſall Church.</p>
            <p>2. In the ſecond place, that among all the kindes
of gouernment, and publicke adminiſtration, Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
only is the beſt.</p>
            <p>3. That ſuch is the ſpirituall gouernement of the
Church, as it came to the Vicar of Ieſus Chriſt the
ſucceſſor of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſuch the temporall of the
State and Kingdome of Fraunce, as it holdeth in
the perſon of the King, her soueraigne Lord and
Maiſter.</p>
            <p>4. That Kings are, as <hi>Homer</hi> calls them, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and darlings of God, or rather his ſoules image,
as <hi>Meander</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>5. That they are annointed, and thereby ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Chriſtes of the Lord, to the end, ſaith <hi>Simon</hi>
Archbiſhop of Theſſalonica, that each one may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that they are inuiolable, and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected,
as things holy and ſacred.</p>
            <p>6. That it is a damnable hereſie (euen as Saint
<hi>Ireneus</hi> noted it fourtéene hundred yéeres agoe) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue,
that Kings are giuen to men by chaunce or hap,<note place="margin">S. Iren lib. 5. Cap 24.</note>
conſidering that all power commeth of God. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb facs="tcp:9320:10"/>
ſaith Saint <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Damieta,</hi> in the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
paintings, wée behold a hand comming out of
heauen, that ſets a Crowne vpon their head.</p>
            <p>7. That whoſoeuer reſiſteth Kings, or rebelleth
againſt them,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 2.</note> begetteth his owne damnation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the doc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rine of the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>8. That obedience is due vnto them, not because
they are vertuous, wiſe, potent, or endued with other
commendable qualities: but becauſe they are Kings,
eſtabliſhed by God.</p>
            <p>9. That our Kings in Fraunce, are the eldeſt in
the Church, endowed with rare and ſignall priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
aboue the common condition of other Kings in
the world.</p>
            <p>10. That it is not lawfull to denie them obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
much leſſe then to reuolt or turne againſt them:
although they were vicious, hard to endure, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
according as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaketh.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>11. That in ſuch caſe, we ought to pray for them,
as the Prophet willed it to be done, for the proſperity
of <hi>Nabuchodonozer,</hi> and <hi>Balthazar</hi> his ſonne. And
that afflictions, loſſe of goods, perſecutions, and other
diſcommodities, are to be endured patiently: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
rebelling (for any of theſe) againſt ſuperiours,
becauſe ſuch things are moſt acceptable to God, and
conformable to the praiſe, which (in the like caſe) S.
<hi>Paule</hi> gaue to the Hebrewes, and to the ordinance
which he had publiſhed in the Church,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 34.</note> ſaying, <hi>Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
ſoule be ſubiect to the ſuperiour powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. And therefore, that not only it is vnlawfull, to
attempt vpon their perſons; but alſo, that it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable
paricide, a prodigious offence, and a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſacriledge.</p>
            <p>13. That the Decrée in the Councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi>
in the fiftéenth Seſſion, ought to bée receiued of all
<pb facs="tcp:9320:11"/>
men, and alſo to be maintained inuiolably.</p>
            <p>14. That the declaration of <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> in the yéere
141<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. and that of Iune this preſent yéere, is good, holy
and wholſome.</p>
            <p>15. What euery one is to be aduertiſed, to take
héede of diuers Bookes, which goe againſt the Edicts,
the reading whereof is not only in this matter great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dangerous: but much more to be feared, that their
Authors being (to our extreame gréef) themſelues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
from the Catholique Church, doe hold (as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)
the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> all Catholique cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and the Doctors before mentioned: but that
which is to be deplored, they doe fortifie themſelues
the ſtronger in their opinions, by their oppoſition,
and ſéeme to render themſelues ſo much the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable
vnto their admirers.</p>
            <p>I would note downe the places, ſpecifie the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and alledge the very words: were it not, that it
is much better, they ſhould remaine buried in the
bottomleſſe depth of obliuion: and fitteth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently,
to make knowne, that innocencie hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
arms, then this recrimination.</p>
            <p>And for this reaſon alſo, I could wholly haue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
from this aduertiſement, had it not béene my
deſire to ſhew, that the body of our company, can no
more bee infected by the opinion of one man, then
thoſe of the pretended reformed Religion, doe finde
themſelues any way intereſſed, by the erronious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of ſome of their owne ranke: whom they reiect,
diſallowe, and condemne, as willing to liue (with vs)
vnder the lawes of the Kingdome, and with the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and voluntarie ſubmiſſion, which wée render
to the Scepter of our Kings. And I am perſwaded,
that if they had the penne in hand, as I haue, they
would ſay with vs, and thunder out a curſe (euen
<pb facs="tcp:9320:11"/>
in common voyce) againſt ſuch infamous Authors.</p>
            <p>Which being maturely and wiſely conſidered, as
well by the Court of Parliament, as by the ſacred
College of <hi>Sorbonne:</hi> they haue made no mention at
all in their Arreſt and Decree, of the doctrine of the
Ieſuites. Knowing very well, like iuſt Iudges and
Doctors, that faults are perſonall; that there would
bee no innocencie in the world, if the offence of one
man ſhould be imputed to another, and that it hath
beene a deplorable and incommunicable property of
ſinne, which was committed by the firſt man, to haue
his extendure ouer others, becauſe his poſterity was
repreſented in his perſon. Knowing alſo elſe-where,
by the reiterated diſpoſition of the wicked, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi>
had not in any thing contributed to this execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parricide, neither could he doe it: conſidering,
that the villaine had not ſufficient intelligence, of the
tongue, wherein the ſaid booke was written.</p>
            <p>Wherein is diſcouered, the ſcarſe charitable inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch as ſticke not to ſay, that he had it all by
hart, to the end, to throw the publique hatred of this
miſhappe, on others, then on the culpable himſelfe. It
is then in this caſe, Madame, that you are moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
intreated, to imploy your ſupreame authority,
and to ordaine, that all thoſe writings, which, in the
beginning are ſmall glimpſes of rebellion, and (in
few houres) will become flaming Beacons of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
may bee taken from the inſtant view of the
French: you are our Soueraigne Lady, endued by
God, with a high vnderſtanding, and with vertues
no way to be equalled, you can clearely diſcerne, how
much it importeth, that we ſhould liue vnited, which
ſéeing it cannot be, in one and the ſame faith, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the iniquity of time, at leaſt let it be in fidelity,
obedience and mutuall affection, for conſeruation of
our peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:9320:12"/>
We haue a King, who in his young age repreſents
to vs, the ſpirit and ſubſtance of great <hi>Henry,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
your huſband, and who with the increaſing of
his yeares, will haue, (while it pleaſeth God to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
vpon him his benigne influences) his valour, his
wiſedome, his good fortune, and his experience. It is
for vs, to cheriſh this treaſure, to ſerue (with good
hearts) this great and little Maſter: And willingly
to obey you his moſt-honoured Mother, our Regent
and Miſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>And to the end, that nothing may trouble the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which onely can (next vnder God) preſerue this
puiſſant Monarchy, and render it euermore dreadfull
to her enimies, how much were it to be deſired, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
that (among vs) there could no falſe ſpeakers be
found? If the impoſture were baniſhed, his fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſhould receiue the wages due to their calumny;
rancours would be rooted vp, and when any ſiniſter
report is brought vs, then iudgement would be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended:
And in a word, according to the Councell of
the Apoſtle, each one would maintaine inuiolably the
band of charity.</p>
            <p>Thoſe <hi>Otaconſtes</hi> and <hi>Proſagogides</hi> of theſe times,
are greatly to be feared, and ſome doe holde aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that if it ſo liked your Maieſty, ſuch tongues ſhould
receiue the recompence of the auncient <hi>Quadrupla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores.</hi>
But if they haue it not from men, let them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the ineuitable iuſtice of him, who is the Author,
protector, and (in the end) the rewarder of innocence.</p>
            <p>Our ſmall company is entred, and (aboue al other
Religious families) moſt expoſed to the hatred and
calumny of ſuch, as will not take the paines to know
them. And you doe know, Madam, how many times
the deceaſed King our good Maſter, did himſelfe doe
vs the fauour, to defend and make vs knowne: you
<pb facs="tcp:9320:12"/>
can witneſſe it, and no body knowes it better then
you, that whereſoeuer that great Prince was, we had
in him a King, a Father, and a Defender. But alas,
it can no more be ſo, great <hi>Henry</hi> is taken away from
vs.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the eye of Chriſtendome, Roſe of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
and Pearle of the world, how great is this loſſe
for thée, and how horrible this ſhip-wracke? <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
the fauorite of heauen, and welbeloued of God; who
hath taken away the Mantle of glory, that couered
thée, and the crowne of honour, that exalted it ſelfe ſo
highly vpon thy head? who hath dealt with thée ſo,
thou choſen of God? who hath thus afflicted thée?</p>
            <p>But thou poore ſociety, that couldeſt not ſubſiſt, but
by the bleſſings of that Monarch, who hath made thée
ſo deſolate? ſo deplorably abaſed, and ſo miſerably
enthralled? the miſfortune is common to all, but it is
ſingularly particular to thée, this blow hath ſmitten
the whole body of the Kingdom, but it hath wounded
thee (almoſt) mortally. O how approuedly is it
true, and how ſenſibly doſt thou féele it; that griefe if
it had a tongue, could not call it ſelfe griefe? And I,
that write theſe things, how iuſt reaſon haue I, yea,
more then all others, to leaue my ſelfe to the ſadde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
of a teares-drowned voyce, and to ſay, Adiew
O thou wonder of Kings, Adiew thou ornament of
this age, our ioy, our glory, and our honour, Adiew
thou father of the weale publick, reſtorer of the ſtate,
ſecond founder and chéefeſt benefactor of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
            <p>Adiew my King, my Prince and my defender, thou
haſt giuen vs in this vale of teares, the reſt that is
here to be had: reſt thée then in peace, liue for euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Lillies and the Roſes, deliuered from the
thorny charge of this Monarchy, and enioy the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:9320:13"/>
not of earth, but of heauen. Here thou haſt
bin the moſt eminent ſubiect of the grace of God, be
there now on high, and for euer ſo continue, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of his mercies. The laurels of this baſe earth,
doe wither very eaſily, let thy head weare them that
are alwaies verdant: Thoſe victories, triumphs,
and Empires, which thou beheldeſt here below; are
now changed into a more eminent glory, liue then for
euer reioycing in that poſſeſſion (of all men) moſt
deſired.</p>
            <p>Thy happineſſe giues vs leaue to reſpire, thy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
iuſtly compels vs to ſuſpire, and the place
where we make no doubt thou art, makes vs thither
to aſpire: for leaning on the mercy of God, the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful
circumſtances of thy deceaſe, cannot depriue
vs of hope, to méete thée in the goodly great day, euen
there, where we ſhall finde thy principall, and the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
arriuall, after ſo gréeuous a diuorce.</p>
            <p>And during the ſadneſſe of this expectation, you
Madam, with the King his liuely Image, ſhall wipe
away part of our teares. We doe acknowledge his
perſon in your perſons, his Crown, in your Crowns,
and his authority Royall, in yours: and though all
your ſubiects are bound thereto, by all kindes of
dueties; yet our company, being thereto extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
obliged: haue charged me to preſent at the
feet of your Maieſty, the moſt ſincereſt vowes of their
fidelity, and affectuous offers of their moſt humble
ſeruice, which I doe, Madam, and ſo much the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>more

taſte of grace,</p>
