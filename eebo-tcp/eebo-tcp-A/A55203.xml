            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>ARchidamus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Zeuxidamus,</hi> having reigned gloriouſly over the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> left behind him two Sons: <hi>Agis</hi> the elder was begotten of <hi>Lamprido,</hi> a very Noble and Illuſtrious Lady. <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> much the<note place="margin">

Agis</hi> being Heir appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the Crown, was bred ſuitably to his Birth. <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> the younger Brother, was educated according to the uſual Diſcipline of the Country, which was very hard and ſevere, but ſuch as taught young Men how
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33760:6"/>
to obey their Superiors. Whence it was that (Men ſay) <hi>Simonides</hi> called <hi>Sparta</hi> the Tamer of Men, becauſe by a cuſtomary ſtrictneſs of Education, they inured the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to Obedience, and patient Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Horſes are broke to the Saddle: The Law did not hold ſo ſtrict a Rein on the Heirs apparent of the Crown. But <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> whoſe good Fortune it was to be born a younger Brother, was conſequently bred to all the <hi>Laconick</hi> Arts of Obedience, and thereby fitted for the Management of the Government, when it fell to his ſhare: Hence it was that he became the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings, having learned how to temper the Grandeur of a Royal Condition, with the Sweetneſs and Debou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nairneſs of familiar Condeſcenſions.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was yet a Boy, bred up in one of the Schools or Colledges of Youth, he contracted an Intimacy with <hi>Lyſander,</hi> (a<note place="margin">His Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>Lyſander.</hi>
               </note> great Man afterwards in <hi>Lacedaemon</hi>) who much admired a generous Modeſty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Shame he found in him: For tho<note place="margin">And his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> he was one of the higheſt Spirits, and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Bravery of any of his Companions, always ambitious of Preheminence above them, towards which the impetuous Vigour and invincible Fervour of his Mind irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtibly carried him, maugre all Oppoſition or Difficulty he could meet with; yet on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33760:6"/>
the other ſide he was ſo eaſie and gentle in his Nature, and ſo apt to hearken to all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and friendly Propoſals, that a good Word wrought more upon him than the greateſt Dint of Force; he being ready to do any thing upon ingenuous Motives, but nothing upon Compulſion.</p>
            <p>He had one Leg ſhorter than another; which Deformity he eaſily hid by a good meen and briskneſs in his Behaviour, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt alway to paſs a Jeſt upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And indeed it was a great Argument of his Love to Glory and great Actions, that his Lameneſs was no Diſcouragement to him in the purſuit of them. Neither his Statue nor Picture are extant, he never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them in his Life, and utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them to be made after his Death: He is ſaid to have been a little Man, of a contemptible Preſence; but the goodneſs of his Humour, and his conſtant Chearfulneſs, and agreeable Converſation, alway free from any thing of Moroſeneſs or Haughtineſs, made him more amiable (even to his old Age) than the moſt beautiful Men of the Nation.</p>

ſoon betook themſelves to <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> his Party, being thereto induced by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they had of his Gallantry, of which they themſelves had been Spectators, in the time that he had been bred up among them. Yet was not his way ſo ſmooth as to be free from Rubs: one he met with very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable from a Fortune-teller named <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithes,</hi> who was of great Eſteem among them for his Skill in Divination; he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That it was unlawful to make a lame Man King of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> citing to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the following Oracle:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Great is thy Empire, <hi>Sparta,</hi> yet beware</l>

            <p>But <hi>Lyſander</hi> was not wanting of an Evaſion, alledging, That if the <hi>Spartans</hi> made any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Oracle, they muſt have a care of <hi>Leotychides;</hi> for it was not the limping Foot of a King that the Gods were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, but the baſtardizing of the <hi>Herculean</hi> Family, into whoſe Rights if a ſpurious Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue were admitted, it would make the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to Halt indeed. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> made <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptune</hi> alſo a Witneſs of the Baſtardy of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychides,</hi> proving that <hi>Agis</hi> was thrown out of Bed from his Wife by a violent Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,

But whereas <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi> ſaith of him, That by complying with,<note place="margin">His Policy.</note> and as it were being ruled by his Country, he grew into ſo great Power with them, that he could do what he pleaſed. This was by the Power he got with the <hi>Ephori</hi> and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: theſe were of great Authority in the State; the former were Officers annually choſen; the Senators held their Places du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Life, both inſtituted as Bridles to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Licentiouſneſs of the Kings, as it is already more fully diſcourſed in the Life of <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> Hence it was that there was alway a Feud and Contention between them and the Kings. But <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother courſe; inſtead of contending with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33760:8"/>
them, he courted them: he alway acted by their Advice, was alway ready to go, nay almoſt to run, when they called him: If he were upon his Throne hearing of Cauſes, and the <hi>Ephori</hi> came in, he aroſe to them; whenever any Man was elected into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, he did alway preſent him with a Gown and an Ox. Thus whilſt he craftily made ſhew of Reverence to them, and a Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their Power, he ſecretly advanced his own Wealth, and enlarged the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Crown, by ſeveral Liberties which their Friendſhip to his Perſon did grant him, or at leaſt did wink at. To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Citizens he ſo behaved himſelf, as to be leſs blameable in his Enmities than in his Friendſhips: for towards his Enemy he behaved himſelf generouſly, ſcorning to take any unjuſt Advantage againſt him; but to his Friends he was partial, even in things manifeſtly unjuſt. If an Enemy had done any thing praiſe-worthy, he ſcorned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any thing from his due Praiſes; but his Friends he knew not how to reprove when they did ill; nay, he glory'd in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them off when they were obnoxious: He thought all Offices of Friendſhip com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, let the Matter wherein they were employ'd be what it will. Again, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Adverſaries was overtaken in a Fault, he would pity them, and be ſoon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33760:9"/>
to Pardon them, and ſhew them Kindneſs, by which means he allured the hearts of all Men: inſomuch that his Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity grew at laſt ſuſpected by the <hi>Ephori,</hi> who fined him as a Monopolizer of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, who ought to be the common Goods of the Republick. For as it is the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Philoſophers, that if you take away Strife and Oppoſition out of the Univerſe, all the Bodies of it will ſtand ſtill, Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Motion will ceaſe, by reaſon of the mutual Conſent and Agreement of all things. So the <hi>Spartan</hi> Legiſlator did ſeem to have mingled Ambition and Emulation, among the Ingredients of his Commonwealth, as the Incentives of Vertue, as thinking that mutual Compliance, in winking at one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, in Caſes that deſerved Rebuke, was but a falſe ſort of Concord, no way uſeful to the Publick, but rather a Corruption of it. This ſome Men think <hi>Homer</hi> to have had an eye to, when he introduceth <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon</hi> well pleaſed with the Jars of <hi>Ulyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Achilles,</hi> and with the hard Words that paſſed between them; which he would never have done, unleſs he had thought that Diſſentions and Factions of great Men had been of uſe to the State. Yet this Maxim is not ſimply to be granted him without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, for if the Heats grow too big, they are very dangerous to Cities, and of moſt pernicious conſequence.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33760:10"/>
than that of preferring him to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Army was drawing to the Rendezvous at <hi>Geraſtus, Ageſilaus</hi> went with ſome of his Friends to <hi>Aulis,</hi> where in a Dream he ſaw a Man approach him, and ſpeak to him after this manner: <hi>O King of</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Dream.</note> 
               <hi>the</hi> Lacedaemonians, <hi>you cannot but know that (before yourſelf) there hath been but one General Captain of the</hi> Greeks, viz. Agamemnon; <hi>now that you ſucceed him in the ſame Office and Command of the ſame Men, leading them out of the ſame Country to the War, you ought alſo to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch a Sacrifice, as he made before he weighed Anchor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſoon remembred that the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which <hi>Agamemnon</hi> offered was a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, he being ſo directed by the Oracle: Yet was he not at all diſturbed at it, but as ſoon as he aroſe, he telleth his Dream to his Friends, adding withal, That he would worſhip the Goddeſs with ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices as would be acceptable to her, and not imitate the rude Barbarity of that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. He therefore ordered an Hind to be crowned with Chaplets; and delivered to his own Southſayer, not to him whom the <hi>Baeotians</hi> did of courſe delegate to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. When the <hi>Baeotian</hi> Governours under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood<note place="margin">The <hi>Baeoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel about the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> it, they were very much moved, and ſent Officers to <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> to forbid his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:33760:10"/>
contrary to the Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Theſe having deliver'd their Meſſage to him, immediately went to the Altar, and threw down the Quarters of the Hind that lay upon it. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> took this very ill, and without further Sacrifice, immediately hoiſed Sail, being ever after a great Enemy to the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> and much diſcouraged in his Mind at the bad Omen, boading to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an unſucceſsful Voyage, and a bad iſſue of the whole Expedition.</p>
            <p>When he came to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he found the Power of <hi>Lyſander</hi> grow very great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious, all Applications made to him, great Crowds of Suitors alway attending at his Door, all Men following and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of him at ſo high a rate, as if nothing but the Name of Empire was left to <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> the whole Power of it being devolved<note place="margin">The Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander.</hi>
               </note> upon <hi>Lyſander.</hi> None of all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that were ſent this Voyage into <hi>Aſia,</hi> was either ſo powerful or ſo formidable; no one rewarded his Friends better, or was more ſevere againſt his Enemies. Which things made the greater Impreſſion in Mens Minds, becauſe they obſerved the debon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nair and popular Behaviour of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> whereas that of <hi>Lyſander</hi> was high and rigid. He took Men up ſhort, and by that fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Carriage ſo ſubdued the Spirits of Men, that they wholly ſubmitted to him,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33760:11"/>
giving little Regard to <hi>Ageſilaus.</hi> This was firſt ſtomached by the other Captains, who with Indignation reſented it, that they ſhould be rather the Followers of <hi>Lyſander,</hi> than the Counſellors of <hi>Ageſilaus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> himſelf, though no envious Man in his Nature, nor apt to be troubled at the Honours redounding upon other Men, yet being highly jealous of his own Glory, began to apprehend that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſander</hi>'s Greatneſs would ſoon eclipſe his,<note place="margin">It reſented by <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus.</hi>
               </note> and carry away from him the Reputation of whatever great Action ſhould happen. He therefore went this way to work: He firſt oppoſed him in all his Counſels; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever<note place="margin">And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</note> 
               <hi>Lyſander</hi> adviſed, was rejected, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Propoſals followed. Then whoever made any Addreſs to him, if he found him a Retainer to <hi>Lyſander,</hi> certainly loſt his Suit. Whoever was proſecuted by him in Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Matters, was ſure to get off with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and whoever was viſibly favoured by him, was uſed with all Severity and Rigor. Theſe things being not done by Chance, but conſtantly and on ſet purpoſe, <hi>Lyſander</hi> was ſoon ſenſible of them, and ſtuck not to tell his Friends, that they ſuffered for his ſake, bidding them apply themſelves to the King, and ſuch as were more powerful with him than he was. Which Sayings of his, when they ſeemed to be deſigned purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:33760:11"/>
to procure Envy to <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> he ſtuck not to affront <hi>Lyſander</hi> at a higher rate, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon him the Office of dividing the Fleſh among the Souldiers, and would in publick Companies ſpeak ſcornfully of him, bidding them go and pay their Obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Suttler of the Camp. <hi>Lyſander</hi> no longer able to brook theſe things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained at laſt to <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> himſelf, telling him, That he knew very well how to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Friends. To which <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, <hi>I know who they be that pretend to more Power than myſelf. That,</hi> replied <hi>Lyſander, is rather ſaid by you, than done by me; I deſire one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Favour of you, that you will aſſign me ſome Office and Place, in which I may ſerve you without incurring Envy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſent him to the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpont</hi> on an Embaſſy, whence he procured <hi>Mithridates,</hi> a <hi>Perſian</hi> of the Province of <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabazus,</hi> to come to the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Greeks</hi> with 200 Horſe, and a great Supply of Money. Yet did not his Stomach ſo come down, but he fell to forming a Deſign of wreſting the Kingdom out of the Hands of the two Families which then enjoy'd it, and make it wholly Elective: and it is thought that he would have made a great Commotion in <hi>Sparta,</hi> if he had not died in the <hi>Baeotian</hi> War. Thus ambitious Spirits are apt to grow troubleſom in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33760:12"/>
and when they tranſgreſs their Bounds, do more harm than good. Of this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Reflection upon both.</note> this Quarrel between two ſuch great Men is an Example: for though <hi>Lyſander</hi>'s Pride was unſufferable, and his ambitious Projects very inconvenient to <hi>Ageſilaus</hi>'s Affairs, yet might the King have found out many ways of taming him, leſs reproachful to a Man of his Quality, and ambitious Deſigns. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in my opinion they were both equally Guilty, both blinded with the ſame Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo as one not to know the Power of his Prince, the other not to bear with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of his Friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tiſaphernes</hi> being at firſt afraid of <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> ſoon treated with him about ſetting the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities at Liberty, which was agreed on. But ſoon after finding a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tiſaphernes</hi> his Falſhood.</note> Force drawn together, he reſolved upon War, for which <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was not ſorry. For the Expectation of this Expedition was great, and he did not think it for his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that <hi>Xenophon,</hi> with 10000 Men, ſhould march through the heart of <hi>Aſia</hi> to the Sea, beating the King's Forces when and how he pleaſed, and that <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> in the Head of a <hi>Spartan</hi> Army, (ſo terrible both by Sea and Land,) ſhould make ſo great a Voyage, and raiſe no Monument of his Fame by any great Action: Therefore to be even with <hi>Tiſaphernes,</hi> he revengeth his<note place="margin">Revenged.</note>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:33760:12"/>
Perjury by a Stratagem: he pretends to go to <hi>Caria,</hi> whither when he had drawn <hi>Tiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phernes</hi> and his Army, he ſuddenly turneth back, and falleth upon <hi>Phrygia,</hi> taking ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Cities, and carrying away great Booty. He took this occaſion of ſhewing, that for Friends to break their Solemn Leagues, and betray their Faith, was a downright Contempt of the Gods; but the Circumvention of an Enemy in War, is not only Juſt but Honourable, and of great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Author of it.</p>
            <p>Being weak in Horſe, and withal terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome ill Omen in the Sacrifices, (<hi>viz.</hi> a Calf's Liver wanted that little Lobe which the Southſayers call the Head) he retired to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and there raiſed them: He obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged<note place="margin">

He profeſſed in this to imitate the laudable Example of <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> who took the Preſent of an excellent Mare, to diſmiſs a rich Coward from the Army.</p>
            <p>

He alſo found out ways of diſcovering the Avarice and the Injuſtice of many of them in their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet, when they were by others brought into Queſtion, he made it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to bring them off, obliging them by that means, of Enemies to become his Friends, and ſo by degrees wore out the Faction.</p>

According to the Cuſtom of <hi>Sparta,</hi> the Kings, if they were in Town, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Dined together.

well as himſelf. He therefore alway diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed him about handſome Boys, egging him forward that way, and himſelf aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, ſo far as to become the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the Amour.

            <p>Having thus eſtabliſhed his Power in the City, he eaſily obtained that his half Brother <hi>Teleutias</hi> might be choſen Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;<note place="margin">His Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi>

This he refuſed, but gave them leave to carry on the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, if they pleaſed, and he in the mean time ſtaid and guarded them. When <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> marched off, the <hi>Argives</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Sports again, with this variety of Fortune, that ſome who were Victors

            <p>When he brought back his Army from <hi>Baeotia</hi> through <hi>Megara,</hi> as he was going up to the Town-Hall, in the Caſtle of that Town, he was ſuddenly taken with Pain,<note place="margin">Falleth lame of his better Leg.</note> and convulſive Motions on his better Leg, upon which a great Tumour and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſoon aroſe.

               <hi>Sparta</hi> had grown great by War, to the great Grievance of all her Neighbours.

Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas</hi> briskly returned the Queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were ſit that</hi> Sparta <hi>ſhould live by hers?

               <hi>him ſet forth what ground he had for pleading ſuch Immunity for</hi> Baeotia. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain asked him, <hi>What grounds he had for demanding liberty for</hi> Sparta? <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was ſo enraged at this, that he immediately ſtruck the <hi>Thebans</hi> out of the League, and declared War againſt them. With the reſt of the <hi>Greeks</hi> he made a Peace, and diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them with this Saying, <hi>That what could be peaceably adjuſted, ſhould; what was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe incurable, muſt be committed to the Succeſs of War, it being a thing of too great difficulty to provide for all things by Treaty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Ephori</hi> did hereupon diſpatch their Orders to <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi> who was at that time in <hi>Phocis,</hi> to march directly into <hi>Baeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and at the ſame time ſent to their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies for Help.

He thought the preſent Juncture of Affairs very advantageous to it, the reſt of <hi>Greece</hi> being wholly free, and in League with them, the <hi>Thebans</hi> only exempted. But that this War was undertaken more
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33760:30"/>
upon Paſſion than Judgment, the Event did prove: for the Treaty was finiſhed but the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> and the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> receiv'd their great Overthrow at <hi>Leuctrae</hi>

               </note> the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> within 20 days.

            <p>This unexpected Blow, which fell ſo heavy upon the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> brought greater Glory to <hi>Thebes,</hi> than ever was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by any other of the <hi>Grecian</hi>-Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, in their Civil Wars againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <hi>Spartans</hi> were Celebrating a ſolemn Feaſt, at which many Strangers were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſent from other Countries, and the Town full of them, when this News of the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw came. The <hi>Ephori,</hi> though they were ſufficiently aware, that this Blow had quite ruined the <hi>Spartan</hi> Grandeur, and its Primacy over the reſt of <hi>Greece,</hi> yet gave Orders that the Dancing ſhould not break off, nor any of the Ceremonies of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival abate. The next Morning, when they had full Intelligence concerning it, and every body knew who were ſlain, and who ſurvived, the Fathers of the ſlain came out rejoycing in the Market-place, ſaluting each other with a kind of Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; on the contrary, the Fathers of the Survivors hid themſelves at home among the Women, as wholly aſhamed of their Children. If Neceſſity drove any of them abroad, they went very dejectedly, with down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Looks, and ſorrowful Countenances. The Women out-did the Men in it: Such whoſe Sons were Slain, openly rejoycing, and meeting triumphantly in the Temples; they who expected their Children home, being very ſilent, and much troubled.</p>
            <p>But the common People being awaken'd by this Calamity, and withal terrified with the News of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> his Deſign of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> began to think of the

either upon it, or within the Limits of it, that might raiſe him a Trophy there, he could not tempt <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> out of his Hold, but was fain to march off again, waſting the Country as he went.</p>

               <hi>Strabo,</hi> the Father of <hi>Pompey.</hi> All his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, 'tis true, they ſtood in awe of his Martial Proweſs and Power, (for indeed he was a mighty Warriour) but immediately upon his Death, (which happened by a Stroke of Thunder) they Treated him Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly, dragging his very Corps from the Hearſe, as it was carried in Pomp at his Funeral, with Villany and Diſgrace. On<note place="margin">Their Love to him.</note> the other ſide, in Favour of <hi>Pompey,</hi> never had any <hi>Roman</hi> the Peoples Good-will and Devotion more zealous throughout all the Changes of Fortune, either ſpringing up earlier, and aſpiring together with him in Proſperity, or ſo conſtantly Loyal in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, as <hi>Pompey</hi> had. In <hi>Strabo,</hi> there was one great cauſe of Hatred, his unſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Covetouſneſs; but in <hi>Pompey</hi> there were many, whereby he became the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Love; his Temperance of Life,<note place="margin">His Vertues</note> Skill, and Exerciſe in Martial Diſcipline, Eloquence of Speech, Integrity of Mind, and Affability in Converſation and Addreſs; inſomuch as no Man ever made his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes with leſſer Trouble, or gratifi'd an Addreſſor with more Delight: For in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, when he gave, 'twas without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; when he receiv'd, 'twas with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Honour.</p>
            <p>In his Youth, he had a Grace in his<note place="margin">His Favour.</note> Countenance extremely taking, ſeeming
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33760:43"/>
to anticipate his Eloquence, and win upon the Affections of the People before he ſpoke; for in his Air there was a Majeſtick Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, temper'd with no leſs Candor and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: And when as yet he was but in the Flower and Dawn of his Manhood, there appear'd in his Deportment a ſage and princely Genius, even in its Meridian. His Hair ſate ſomewhat hollow or riſing a little: and the languiſhing motion of his Eyes, ſeem'd to form a reſemblance in his Face, (though perhaps more through the ſpeech of People, than real likeneſs) to the Statues of King <hi>Alexander:</hi> Now becauſe many call'd him by that Name in his Youth, <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf did not decline it, inſomuch that ſome in deriſion call'd him ſo; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Lucius Philippus,</hi> a Man of Conſular Dignity, when he was pleading in favour of him, thought it not unfit to ſay, <hi>That there was nothing abſurd or unexpected in this, that he himſelf being</hi> Philip, <hi>ſhould be a Lover of</hi> Alexander.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33760:44"/>
fell in Love with her, and made his Court with all the Arts imaginable; but ſhe refuſing, and telling him, Howe're her Inclinations were, yet ſhe could not grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Deſires for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ſake: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mov'd <hi>Pompey</hi> in it, and <hi>Pompey</hi> frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave his Conſent, but never afterwards would touch her, or have any Converſe with her, notwithſtanding he ſeem'd to have a great Paſſion for her; which <hi>Flora</hi> reſented, not with the Levity of a Strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, for that ſhe languiſh'd afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a tedious Sickneſs, through Grief and Deſire. Now, 'twas ſaid, That this <hi>Flora</hi> became ſuch a celebrated Beauty, that <hi>Cecilius Metellus,</hi> when he adorn'd the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> with divers rare Pictures and Images; among the reſt, he dedicated hers for her ſingular Beauty. But <hi>Pompey</hi> was quite beſides his natural Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in his Deportment towards the Wife of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> his Franchis'd Servant (who had a great Influence upon him in his Life-time, and left an Eſtate of 4000 Talents) where he demean'd himſelf neither gentilely nor ingeniouſly, fearing leſt he ſhould fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the common Cenſure of being ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd and charm'd with her Beauty, which was incomparable, and became famous every where. Thus though herein he ſeem'd to be providently circumſpect and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:33760:44"/>
Cautious, yet even in Scandals of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he could not avoid the Calumnies of his Enemies, but that upon the ſcore of Women, his Wives at leaſt, they play'd the Sycophants with him, and accus'd him, as if he had Conniv'd at many Things, and Imbezil'd the publick Revenue to gratifie their Luxury.</p>
            <p>Then for his Sobriety, and Temperance<note place="margin">His Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> in Diet, there was one remarkable paſſage in his Sickneſs; when his Stomach nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeated common Meats, his Phyſician pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd him a <hi>Thruſh</hi> to Eat; but upon ſearch there was none to be bought, (for they were not then in Seaſon) and one telling him, They were to be had at <hi>Lucullus</hi>'s, who kept them all the year round, <hi>Why then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if it were not for</hi> Lucullus's <hi>Luxury, ſhould not</hi> Pompey <hi>live?</hi> Thereupon wiſhing Health to his Phyſician, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd him, and accepted of what was in Seaſon. But of that hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Pompey</hi> being as yet a very young Man, and upon an Expedition, (in which his Father was appointed General againſt <hi>Cinna</hi>) had in his Tent with him one <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Terentius,</hi> his Companion and Comrade, who, being corrupted by <hi>Cinna,</hi> enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Engagement to kill <hi>Pompey,</hi> as others had done to ſet the Generals Tent on Fire. This Conſpiracy being diſcovered to <hi>Pompey</hi>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:33760:45"/>
at Supper, he ſeem'd no ways diſcompos'd at it, but drank more liberally than uſual, and expreſs'd an extraordinary Kindneſs to <hi>Terentius;</hi> then about Bed-Time (pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go to his Repoſe) he ſtole away ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly out of his own Tent, and ſetting a Guard about his Father, went to his Reſt: <hi>Terentius</hi> now thinking his Enterprize ripe for Execution, roſe with his naked Sword, and coming to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Bed-ſide, ſtabb'd ſeveral Strokes through the Bed-Cloaths, as if he were lying there. Immediately upon this there was a great Uproar through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Camp, ariſing from the Hatred they bore to the General, and an Univerſal Inclination of the Soldiers to Mutiny, all tearing down their Tents, and betaking themſelves to their Arms; the General himſelf all this while durſt not venture out becauſe of the Tumult, but <hi>Pompey</hi> running into the midſt of them, beſeech'd them with Tears, and at laſt threw himſelf proſtrate upon his Face before the door of the Trench, and lay there in the paſſage, as a Bar at their Feet, bewailing his Fate, and bidding thoſe that were marching off, if they would go, to trample upon him; whereupon every Man began to retreat, and all, except 800, either through Shame or Compaſſion, repented of their Folly, and were Reconcil'd to the General.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:33760:45"/>Immediately upon the Death of <hi>Strabo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actio pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus.</note> there was an Action commenc'd againſt <hi>Pompey</hi> as his Heir, for that his Father had imbezil'd the publick Treaſure; But <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> having well trac'd the Thief, charg'd it upon one <hi>Alexander,</hi> a franchis'd Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Slave of his Fathers, and made an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Evidence before the Judges, that he had purloin'd and converted it to his own Uſe. Afterwards he himſelf was Arraign'd, for that he had ſeiz'd upon the Toils, or Hunting Tackle, and Books, that were taken at <hi>Aſculum.</hi> To this he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd thus far, That he receiv'd them from his Father, when he took <hi>Aſculum,</hi> but Pleaded farther, That he had loſt them ſince, which happen'd upon <hi>Cinna</hi>'s Return to <hi>Rome,</hi> when his Houſe was broke open and plunder'd by thoſe of his Guards. This Cauſe was notably managed with his Adverſary in the Preparatories of Judgment, in which he appearing ſtrangely ſubtile and induſtrious beyond his years, gain'd great Reputation and Favour; inſomuch, that <hi>Antiſtius</hi> the Praetor, and Judge of that Cauſe, took a great Liking to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and offer'd him his Daughter in Marriage, having had ſome Treaties and Communications with his Friends about it. <hi>Pompey</hi> accepted of the Conditions, and they were privately<note place="margin">He Marrie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

this Matter was not ſo cloſely convey'd, as to eſcape the Multitude, but it was diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible enough, from the Favours that were ſhewn to him by <hi>Antiſtius</hi> in his Cauſe. Whereupon at laſt, when <hi>Antiſtius</hi> pronounc'd the abſolutory Sentence of the Judges, the People (as if it had been upon a Signal given) made the ſame Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as was anciently us'd at Marriages, <hi>Talaſſio;</hi> the Original of which Cuſtom is Reported to be this: Upon a time, when the Daughters of the <hi>Sabines</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee the Shews and Sports there, and were violently ſeiz'd upon by the Nobles for Wives, it happen'd that ſome Goatſwains and Herdſmen of the meaner Rank, were carrying off a beautiful and proper Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and leſt any of the Nobles ſhould meet them, and take her away, therefore as they ran, they cry'd out with one Voice, <hi>Talaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio:</hi> Now <hi>Talaſſius</hi> was an eminent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Perſon among them, inſomuch, as all that heard the Name, clapp'd their Hands for Joy, and joyn'd with them in the Shout, as applauding and congratulating the Choice; Now, ſay they, (becauſe that prov'd a fortunate Match to <hi>Talaſſius</hi>) hence 'tis that this Acclamation is jocularly us'd as a Nuptial Song at all Weddings. And this is the moſt credible Story that I can meet with touching what is related of <hi>Talaſſio.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:33760:46"/>Some few days after this Judgment, <hi>Pompey</hi> Married <hi>Antiſtia,</hi> and after that went to <hi>Cinna</hi>'s Camp, where finding ſome falſe Suggeſtions and Calumnies forg'd againſt him, he began to be afraid, and preſently withdrew himſelf in diſguiſe from the Camp; this ſudden diſappearance occaſion'd great Jealouſies, and there went a Rumour and Speech throughout all the Camp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if <hi>Cinna</hi> had Murder'd the young Man; whereupon all that had been any ways diſoblig'd, and bore any Malice to him, reſolv'd to make an Aſſault upon him: But he endeavouring to make his Eſcape, was apprehended by a <hi>Centurian,</hi> that purſu'd him with his naked<note place="margin">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33760:48"/>
breaking the Ranks of their own Foot, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that it preſently caus'd a total Rout; whereupon the Commanders fell out among themſelves, and every one march'd off, ſteering their courſe ſome one way, ſome another, as their Fortunes led them: The Towns likewiſe round about came in, and ſurrendred themſelves to <hi>Pompey,</hi> concluding that the Enemy was diſpers'd for fear. Next after theſe came <hi>Scipio</hi> the Conſul to attack him, and with as little Succeſs; for before the Armies could joyn, or be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Throw of their Darts, <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſaluted <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, and came over to them, but <hi>Scipio</hi> made his Eſcape by Flight. Laſt of all, <hi>Carbo</hi> himſelf ſent down divers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Horſe by the River <hi>Arſis,</hi> which <hi>Pompey</hi> aſſail'd with the ſame Courage and Succeſs as thoſe before; for having routed and put them to Flight, he forc'd them in the purſuit upon mooriſh and boggy Places, altogether unpaſſable for Horſe, where ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hopes of Eſcape, they cry'd out Quarter, yielding themſelves, Horſe and Armour, all to his Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylla</hi> was hitherto unacquainted with all this Action; but as ſoon as he had Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his Engagements, he ſeem'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely concern'd, fearing leſt <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould be circumvented and oppreſs'd by ſo many and ſuch experienc'd Commanders of the

Enemy, whereupon he march'd with all ſpeed to his Aid.

            <p>Now when <hi>Sylla</hi> had brought all <hi>Italy</hi> under his Dominion, and was proclaim'd Dictator, he began to reward the reſt of his Followers, (enriching all his Captains and other Officers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) whereof ſome he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to Honour, others to Places of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Profit in the Common-wealth, largely and liberally gratifying every Man according to his Talent and Deſire.

            <p>About this time an Expreſs came to <hi>Sylla,</hi>
               <note place="margin">§ 3.</note> That <hi>Perpenna</hi> had poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Sicily,</hi> whereby that Iſle was now become a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33760:51"/>
and Receptacle for the Reliques of the adverſe Party: That <hi>Carbo</hi> was hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about thoſe Seas with a Navy; That <hi>Domitius</hi> was fallen in upon <hi>Africa;</hi> and that many other likewiſe of the Nobles and great Men in Exile, thinking to avoid his Proſcriptions or Outlawries by Flight, were daily flocking into thoſe Parts. Againſt theſe therefore was <hi>Pompey</hi> ſent with a great Army; and no ſooner was he arrived in <hi>Sicily,</hi> but <hi>Perpenna</hi> departed thence, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Iſland to him. Wherefore <hi>Pompey</hi> received the diſtreſſed Cities into Favour, and treated all with great Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, except that of the <hi>Mamertines</hi> in <hi>Meſſene;</hi> for when they proteſted againſt his Court and Juriſdiction, alledging their Privilege and Exemption founded upon an ancient Charter or Grant of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he replied as ſharply, <hi>What! will you ne'r leave prating of Laws to us that have Swords by our ſides?</hi> 'Tis thought likewiſe, That he ſhewed but little Humanity to <hi>Carbo,</hi> ſeeming rather to inſult over his Misfortunes, than to chaſtize his Crime; for if there had been a neceſſity, (as perhaps there was) that he ſhould be taken off, that might have been done at firſt, as ſoon as he was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, for then it would have been the Act of him that commanded it, and imputed to his Malice; but here <hi>Pompey</hi> commands a Man
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33760:51"/>
(that had been thrice Conſul of <hi>Rome</hi>) to be be brought in Fetters to the Bar, he himſelf ſitting upon the Bench in Judgment, examining the Cauſe throughout all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of Law, and pronouncing Sentence of Death, as upon a common Malefactor, to the Grief and Indignation of all that were preſent; and afterwards he ordered him to be taken away and put to Death. Now, 'tis reported of <hi>Carbo,</hi> That as ſoon as he was brought to the Scaffold, and ſaw the Sword drawn for Execution, it wrought ſo with him, that immediately he had a looſeneſs or pain in his Belly, inſomuch that he deſired a little reſpite of the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and a convenient place to eaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But yet farther, <hi>C. Oppius,</hi> a great Friend of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, tells us, That <hi>Pompey</hi> dealt as barbarouſly with <hi>Q. Valerius,</hi> a Man of ſingular Learning, eſpecially in Philology and Mathematicks few like him; for when he was brought to him, he walk'd aſide and diſcours'd with him, and after a long Conference and full Reſolution of all his Queſtions, having learned what he could, he ordered his Officers to take him away, and put him to Death. But we muſt not be too credulous in all the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives of <hi>Oppius,</hi> eſpecially when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to relate any thing touching the Friends or Foes of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> This is certain,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:33760:52"/>
That there lay a neceſſity upon <hi>Pompey</hi> to be ſevere upon many of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Enemies, thoſe at leaſtwiſe that were eminent Perſons in themſelves, and notoriouſly known to be taken; but for the reſt, he dealt with them after his own natural Temper, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving at the Concealment of ſome, and himſelf being the Inſtrument in the Eſcape of others. And the like Argument of his Clemency was ſhewn in the <hi>Himeraeans;</hi> for when <hi>Pompey</hi> had determined a ſharp Revenge upon their City, for that they had been ſtubborn Abettors of the Enemy, there ſtept out one <hi>Sthenes,</hi> a great Leader of the People there, and craving audience of <hi>Pompey,</hi> told him, <hi>That what he was about to do, was not at all conſiſtent with Juſtice; for that he would paſs by the Guilty, and deſtroy the Innocent: Pompey</hi> demanding, <hi>Who that guilty Perſon was that would father the Offences of them all? Sthenes</hi> replied, <hi>'Twas himſelf who had wrought upon and engaged his Friends by Perſwaſions, and his Enemies by Force:</hi> whereupon <hi>Pompey</hi> being much taken with the frank Speech and Boldneſs of the Man, firſt forgave him his Crime, and then par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all the reſt of the <hi>Himeraeans. Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> likewiſe hearing, That his Soldiers were very diſorderly in their March, doing Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence upon the Roads, he ordered their Swords to be ſealed up in their Scabbards,

In this Equipage he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with his Fleet, part at the Port of <hi>Utica,</hi> part at <hi>Carthage;</hi> and no ſooner was he landed there, but that 7000 of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy revolted and came over to him, which beſides his own Forces that he brought with him (conſiſting of 6 entire Legions) made up an Army of 43000 Fighting-men. Here they tell us of a pleaſant Paſſage that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him at his firſt Arrival; for that ſome of his Soldiers having by accident ſtumbled upon a Treaſure, whereby they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33760:53"/>
got a good Maſs of Money: The reſt of the Army hearing this, began to fancy that the Field was full of Gold and Silver, which had been hid there of old by the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in the time of their Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thereupon fell to work; ſo that the Army was uſeleſs to <hi>Pompey</hi> for many days, being totally engaged in the Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mines, he himſelf all the while walking up and down only, and laughing to ſee ſo many Thouſands together, digging and turning up the Earth in a fruitleſs Harveſt: But at laſt growing weary and hopeleſs, they came to themſelves, and returned to their General, begging him to lead them where he pleaſed, for that they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reaped the juſt Reward of their Folly. By this time <hi>Domitius</hi> had prepared himſelf, and drawn out his Army in Battel-array againſt <hi>Pompey;</hi> but there happened to be a rapid Torrent in the Valley betwixt them, craggy and difficult to paſs over, which, together with the great Storm of Wind and Rain pouring down even from break of Day, ſeemed to ſhew but little poſſibility of their coming together: Inſomuch that <hi>Domitius</hi> not expecting any Engagement that day, commanded his Forces to draw off and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the Camp. Now <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was watchful upon every Occaſion, taking this time to be appointed by Fortune as his own,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33760:53"/>
ordered a March forthwith, and having paſſed over the Torrent, they fell in imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon their Quarters. The Enemy was in a great Diſorder and Tumult, and in that Confuſion attempted a Reſiſtance; but they neither were all there, nor yet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; beſides, the Wind having veered about, lay beating the Rain full in their Faces. Neither indeed was the Storm leſs troubleſom to the <hi>Romans,</hi> for that they could not clearly diſcern one another, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that even <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, eſcaped but narrowly; for when one of his Soldiers demanded of him the Word of Battel, it happened that he was ſomewhat ſlow in his Anſwer, which might have coſt him his Life.</p>

               <hi>once upon</hi> Sylla's <hi>Government and</hi> Pompey's <hi>Honour?</hi> Theſe were the Arguments <hi>Sylla</hi> us'd againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſhewing that he ſhould not by any means yield to his Requeſt; but if he would perſiſt in his Ambition, that he was reſolved to interpoſe his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and lay a Prohibition upon him, as a Lover of Contention and Diſobedience; <hi>Pompey</hi> was no ways daunted at this, but wiſhed <hi>Sylla</hi> to recollect with himſelf, <hi>That more worſhipped the Riſing, than the Setting Sun:</hi> intimating thereby, That his Power was increaſing, and <hi>Sylla</hi>'s in the wain; <hi>Sylla</hi> did not perfectly hear the words, but obſerving a ſort of Amazement and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Looks and Geſtures of thoſe that did hear them, he asked, What it was that he ſaid? When it was told him, he ſeemed to be very much ſurprized with the Boldneſs of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and cried out twice together, <hi>E'ne let him Triumph.</hi> But when others began to ſhew their Stomach and Diſdain, <hi>Pompey,</hi> as <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>tis ſaid, to gall and vex them the more, deſigned to have his triumphant Chariot drawn with four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, (having brought over ſeveral from the Spoils of thoſe <hi>African</hi> Kings) but the Gates of the City being too narrow, he was forced to deſiſt from that Project, and make uſe of Horſes; in the next place, ſome of his Soldiers (who failed of ſome
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:33760:56"/>
Rewards, or been ſome way or other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed) began to clamour and interrupt the Triumph, but <hi>Pompey</hi> regarded theſe as little as the reſt, and plainly told them, <hi>That he had rather loſe the Honour of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, than flatter them.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> (a Perſon of great Quality, and at firſt one of the chiefeſt Oppoſers of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Triumph) ſaid openly, <hi>Now I perceive that</hi> Pompey <hi>is truly Great, and worthy of Triumph; 'tis clearly manifeſt, that he might eaſily have been a Senator if he would, yet he did not ſue for that, eſteeming Honour as a Paradox, and hunting after it, (as 'tis ſaid) not in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Road, but even there where no Man elſe ever did: For what wonder had it been for</hi> Pompey <hi>in his nonage, to ſit in the Senate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time? but to triumph before he was of the Senate, that was the exceſs of Glory to a Miracle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conteſt of his with <hi>Sylla</hi> for Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph did not a little ingratiate him in the good Will of the People; for it could not but be extremely grateful for them to ſee one of their own Order in Triumph and then to return to them again and take his Place among the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights; on the other ſide, 'twas no leſs ungrateful to <hi>Sylla</hi> to ſee how faſt he came on, and to what a height of Glory and Power he was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, yet being aſhamed to hinder him, he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:33760:57"/>
ſmothered his Grief and lay quiet; but when by plain force, and in ſpite of him, <hi>Pompey</hi> procured the Conſulſhip for <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> having by his own Intereſt reconciled him to the Favour of the People, <hi>Sylla</hi> could not contain himſelf any longer, but ſpying him after the Election, as he was croſſing the Market-place with a great Train after him, cried out to him, <hi>Well, Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Man!

Succeſs, for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s was a ſlight Wound only, whereas he lopt off the others Hand: however it hapned ſo that many falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Pompey</hi> together, and his own Forces there being put to the Rout, he made his Eſcape beyond expectation, by quitting his Horſe and turning him up among the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; for the Horſe being richly adorned with golden Trappings, and having a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of great value, the Soldiers quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled among themſelves for the Booty, ſo that while they were fighting with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and dividing the Spoyl, <hi>Pompey</hi> made his Eſcape. By break of Day next morning, each drew out his Forces into the Field to confirm the Victory; but <hi>Metellus</hi> coming up to them, <hi>Sertorius</hi> vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, having broken up and diſperſed his Army; for in ſuch a manner did he uſe to raiſe and disband his Armies, ſo that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would be wandring up and down all alone, and at other times again he would come powring into the Field at the head of a puiſſant Army, no leſs than 150000 fighting Men, ſwelling of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den like a mighty Torrent or Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flood.</p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Pompey</hi> was going after the Battel to meet and welcome <hi>Metellus,</hi> and when they were near one another, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Serjeants to bow down their

            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> having made uſe of and expended the greateſt part of his own Revenue upon the War, ſent and demanded Monies of the Senate, adding, That in caſe they did not furniſh him ſpeedily, he ſhould be forced to return into <hi>Italy</hi> with his Army. <hi>Lucullus</hi> being Conſul at that time, (though indeed he was an Enemy to <hi>Pompey,</hi> yet) in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation that he himſelf was a Candidate

            <p>After this <hi>Pompey</hi> tarried and ſpent ſo<note place="margin">§ 6.</note> much time in <hi>Spain,</hi> as was neceſſary for the ſuppreſſion of thoſe greater Tumults in that Province; and as ſoon as he had qualified and allayed the violent Heats of Affairs there, he returned with his Army<note place="margin">His Aid to <hi>Craſſus</hi> in the Servile War.</note> into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he arrived very luckily in the height of the Servile War; wherefore upon his Arrival, <hi>Craſſus</hi> the General in that

was ſeen afar off to come into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, adorned in all things elſe with all the Marks and Enſigns of a Conſul, but himſelf leading his Horſe in his hand: as he drew near, he commanded the Vergers to make way, and ſo he led his Horſe to the Bench; the People were all this while in a ſort of Amaze, and all in Silence, and the Cenſors themſelves ſhewed him great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, expreſſing a Modeſty together with Joy in their Countenance: Then the Senior Cenſor examined him, Pompey <hi>the Great, I demand of thee, whether thou hast ſerved out all that time in the Wars that is preſcribed by the Law of Arms?

the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. There were of theſe <hi>Corſairs</hi> above 1000 Sail, and they had taken no leſs than 400 Cities; committing Sacriledge upon the Temples of the Gods, and enriching themſelves with the Spoils of divers, undefiled before, ſuch as were thoſe of <hi>Claros, Didyme,</hi> and <hi>Samothrace;</hi> and the Temple of <hi>Tellus,</hi> or the Earth in <hi>Hermione,</hi> and that of <hi>Aeſeulapius</hi> in <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daurium;</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Neptune,</hi> in <hi>Iſthmus, Tae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narus,</hi> and <hi>Calauria;</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Apollo,</hi> in <hi>Actium,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Leucades;</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Juno,</hi> in <hi>Samos, Argos,</hi> and <hi>Leucania.</hi> They offered likewiſe ſtrange Sacrifices up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> and performed certain ſecret Rites or Religious Myſteries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that to the Sun (which they called by the Name of <hi>Mithres</hi>) was preſerved down to our Age, having its Original and firſt Inſtitution from them. But beſides theſe Piracies and Inſolencies by Sea, they were yet more injurious to the <hi>Romans</hi> by Land; for they would often go aſhore and Rob up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the High-ways; plundring and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Villages and Country-Houſes near the Sea: And once they ſeized upon two <hi>Roman</hi> Praetors, <hi>Sextilius</hi> and <hi>Bellinus,</hi> in their Purple Robes, and carried them off, together with their Serjeants and Vergers: The Daughter alſo of <hi>Antonius,</hi> (a Man that had the Honour of Triumph) taking a Journey into the Country, was ſeized

upon, and Redeemed afterwards with an exceſſive Ranſom. But this was the moſt ſpiteful and abuſive of all, That when any of the Captives declared himſelf to be a <hi>Roman,</hi> and told his Name, they ſeemed to be ſurprized, and ſtraightway feigning a Fear, ſmote their Thighs, and fell down at his Feet, humbly beſeeching him to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and forgive them: The credulous Captive, ſeeing them ſo humble and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, believed them to be in earneſt; for ſome were ſo officious as to put on his Shooes, others helpt him on with his Gown, leſt his Quality ſhould be miſtaken again: After all this Pageantry, when they had thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded and mockt him long enough, at laſt caſting out a Ships Ladder, when they were even in the midſt of the Sea, they bid him march off and farewel; if he refuſed, they threw him over-board and drowned him.

The <hi>Romans</hi> therefore, finding themſelves to be extreamly ſtraitned in their Markets, and conſidering that if this ſcarcity of Corn ſhould continue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there would be a Dearth and Famine in the Land, determined to ſend out <hi>Pompey</hi> to recover their Seigniory of the Seas from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:33760:67"/>
the Pirates: Wherefore <hi>Gabinius</hi> (a great Creature of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s) preferred a Law, whereby there was granted to him, not only the Government of the Seas as Admiral, but even the Monarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> as Soveraign, having an Arbitrary and Unlimited Power over all Men; The ſum of that Decree gave him the abſolute Power and Authority of all the Seas, even from the <hi>Streights-Mouth</hi> or <hi>Hercules-Pillars;</hi> together with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent or Mainland, all along for the ſpace of 400 Furlongs, or 50 Miles from the Sea: Now there were but few Regions in the World under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire of a larger Extent, and in that compaſs too there were comprehended great Nations and mighty Kings. Moreover by this Decree he had a Power of electing fifteen Lieutenants out of the Senate, and of aſſigning to each his Province in Charge; Then he might take likewiſe out of the Treaſury, and of the <hi>Publicans,</hi> what Monies he pleas'd, as alſo 200 Sail of Ships, with a Power to Preſs and Levy what Soldiers and Seamen he thought fit, together with Galliots of Oars and Mariners: When this Law was Read, the common People approved of it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, but the chiefeſt and moſt powerful of the Senate looked upon it as an exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Power, even beyond the reach of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and was now become worthy of their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:33760:67"/>
Fears; therefore concluding with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that ſuch an infinite and boundleſs Authority was dangerous, they agreed una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly to oppoſe the Bill, and all were againſt it, except <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who gave his Vote for the Law, not ſo much to gratifie <hi>Pompey,</hi> as the People, whoſe Favour he had cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under-hand from the beginning, and hoped thereby to compaſs ſuch a Power for himſelf: The reſt inveighed bitterly againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> inſomuch as one of the <hi>Conſuls,</hi> told him ſharply, <hi>That if he followed the Footſteps of</hi> Romulus, <hi>he would ſcarce avoid his End,</hi> but he was in danger of being torn in pieces by the Multitude for his Speech: Yet when <hi>Catulus</hi> ſtood up to ſpeak againſt the Law, the People in Reverence to him were very ſilent and attentive; He therefore, after he had, without the leaſt ſhew of Envy, made large Harangues in Honour of <hi>Pompey,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to adviſe the People in kindneſs to ſpare him, and not to expoſe a Man of his Value to ſuch a Chain of Dangers and Wars; For ſaid he, <hi>Where could you find out another</hi> Pompey, <hi>or whom would you have in caſe you ſhould chance to loſe him?</hi> They all cry'd out with one Voice, <hi>Your ſelf;</hi> wherefore <hi>Catu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> finding all his Rhetorick ineffectual, deſiſted: Then <hi>Roſcius</hi> attempted to ſpeak, but could have no Audience, wherefore he made Signs with his Fingers, intimating,

               <hi>Not him alone,</hi> but <hi>that there might be a ſecond</hi> Pompey <hi>or Colleague in Authority with him:</hi> Upon this, 'tis ſaid, the Multitude being extreamly incens'd, made ſuch an horrid Exclamation, that a Crow flying over the Market-Place at that inſtant was ſtruck blind, and dropt down among the Rabble; whereby it appears, That the Cauſe of Birds falling down to the Ground, is not by any rupture or diviſion of the Air when it has received any ſuch Impreſſion or Force; but purely by the very ſtroak of the Voice, which, being ſhot up by a Multitude with great Violence, raiſes a ſort of Tempeſt and Billows in the Air. The Aſſembly therefore broke up for that day: And when the day was come, wherein the Bill was to paſs by Suffrage into a Decree, <hi>Pompey</hi> went pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately into the Country; but hearing that it was paſſed and confirmed, he returned again into the City by Night, to avoid the Envy that might ariſe from that Concourſe of People that would meet and congratulate him: The next Morning he came abroad, and ſacrificed to the Gods, and having Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience at an open Aſſembly, he handled the Matter ſo, as that they enlarged his Power, giving him many Things beſides what was already granted, and almoſt doubling the Preparation appointed in the former Decree: For there were compleately 500 Sail of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33760:69"/>
Ships fitted out, and he had an Army of 120000 Foot, and 5000 Horſe, aſſigned for his Muſter: There were choſen likewiſe for his Lieutenants, or Vice-Admirals, 24 Senators that had been Conſuls, Praetors, or Generals of Armies, and to theſe were added two of the general Treaſurers. Now it happened within this time, that the Prizes of Proviſions were much abated, which gave an occaſion to the joyful People of ſaying, <hi>That the very Name of</hi> Pompey <hi>had e'en ended the War.</hi> However <hi>Pompey</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of his Charge divided all the Sea, with each diſtance between the Lands, into thirteen Parts, allotting a Squadron to each, under the Command of his Vice-Admirals; And having thus diſpers'd his Power into all Quarters, and encompaſſed the Pirats every where, they began to fall into his Draggs by whole Shoals, which he ſeiz'd and brought into his Harbours; As for thoſe that withdrew themſelves betimes, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eſcap'd his general Chace, they all made to <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where they hid themſelves as in their Hives; againſt whom <hi>Pompey</hi> deſign'd to go in Perſon with Sixty of his beſt Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats: But firſt he reſolv'd to ſcour and clear all the Seas thereabout, as that of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> together with the Coaſts of <hi>Africa, Sardinia, Corſica,</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> All which he perform'd in the ſpace of Forty days by his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:33760:70"/>
own indefatigable Induſtry, and the Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his Vice-Admirals. Now <hi>Pompey</hi> met with ſome Diverſion in <hi>Rome,</hi> through the Malice and Envy of <hi>Piſo</hi> the Conſul, who had put ſome ſtop to his Affairs, by waſting his Stores, and diſcharging his Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; whereupon he ſent his Fleet round to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> himſelf going the next way by Land through <hi>Tuſcany</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> which as ſoon as it came to be known by the People, they all flock'd out to meet him upon the way, as if they had not ſent him out but a little before; But that which chiefly rais'd their Joy, was the ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected change in the Markets, abounding now with exceeding Plenty; So that <hi>Piſo</hi> was in great danger to have been depriv'd of his Conſulſhip, <hi>Gabinius</hi> having a Law ready Penn'd for that purpoſe; but <hi>Pompey</hi> forbid it, behaving himſelf as in that, ſo in all Things elſe, with great Moderation, whereby having brought to paſs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd all that he wanted or deſir'd, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted for <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> whence he ſet Sail in purſuit of the Pirats: Now though he was ſtraitned in time, and his haſty Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age forc'd him to Sail by ſeveral famous Cities without touching, yet he would not paſs by the City of <hi>Athens</hi> unſaluted, but landing there, after he had ſacrificed to the Gods, and made an Oration to the People,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:33760:70"/>
as he was returning out of the City, he Read at the Gates two Monoſticks or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Epigrams writ in his own Praiſe.</p>

            <p>Now becauſe that <hi>Pompey</hi> had ſhew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf merciful to ſome of that Swarm of Thieves, that were yet roving in Bodies about the Seas, (having upon their Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ordered a Seizure of their Ships and Perſons only, without any farther Proceſs or Severity;) therefore the reſt of their Camrades in Hopes of Mercy too, made their Eſcape from his other Commanders, and ſurrender'd themſelves with their Wives and Children into his Protection; So tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Pompey</hi> pardon'd all that came in, and the rather becauſe by them he might make a diſcovery of thoſe who fled from his Juſtice, as conſcious that their Crimes were beyond an Act of Indemnity: Whereof the greateſt and chiefeſt part conveyed their Families and Treaſures (with all beſides that were unfit for War) into Caſtles and ſtrong Forts
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:33760:71"/>
about Mount <hi>Taurus;</hi> but they themſelves having well Mann'd their Gallies, imbark'd for <hi>Coraceſium</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where they receiv'd <hi>Pompey,</hi> and gave him Battel; Here they had a fatal Overthrow, and thereupon they retir'd to their Cities, where they were Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd; At laſt, having diſpatch'd their Heralds to him with a Submiſſion, they deliver'd up to his mercy themſelves, their Towns, Iſlands, and ſtrong Holds, all which they had fortified with Bulwarks and Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers, whereby they became impregnable, and almoſt inacceſſible.</p>
            <p>Thus was this War ended, and the whole Power of the Pirats at Sea diſſolved every where in the ſpace of three Months: Wherein beſides a great number of other Veſſels, he took Ninety Men of War with brazen Beaks; and likewiſe Priſoners of War to the number of no leſs than 20000 Souls.</p>
            <p>Touching the diſpoſal of theſe Priſoners, he conſider'd on one Hand, that it would be barbarous to deſtroy them all; and yet it might be no leſs dangerous on the other to diſperſe them, for that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite and make Head again. being nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, poor, and warlike: Therefore well and wiſely weighing with himſelf, That Man by Nature is not a wild or ſavage Creature, neither was he Born ſo, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

their Reſolutions, when the day came wherein it was to paſs into a Decree, their Hearts fail'd them, for fear of the People, and all the reſt were ſilent except <hi>Catulus,</hi> who boldly inveigh'd againſt the Law, and charg'd the People home, but all in vain; for when he found that he had not brought over one Man among the People, he turn'd and directed his Speech to the Senate in great Paſſion, often crying out, and bidding them to <hi>ſeek out ſome Mountain as their Forefathers had done, and fly to the Rocks where they might preſerve their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> But all his Rhetorick was inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, for the Law paſs'd into a Decree, as 'tis ſaid, by the Suffrages of all the Tribes; And now was <hi>Pompey</hi> even in his abſence made Lord of almoſt all that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that <hi>Sylla</hi> made himſelf Maſter of by Conqueſt, when by force of Arms and War he had brought even <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf under his Dominion: Now when <hi>Pompey</hi> had Advice by Letters of the Decree, 'tis ſaid, That, in the preſence of his Friends who came to rejoyce and give him Joy of his Honour, he ſeem'd extremely diſpleas'd, frowning and ſmiting his Thigh, and at laſt, as one overladen already, and weary of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he broke out in great paſſion, <hi>Good Gods!

of <hi>Lucullus</hi> might know how that all his Power and Authority was now at an end, and he no longer Lord of this Province.

great Ceremony and Complaiſance, magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying each others Actions, and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating their Succeſs: but when they came to the Matter of their Conference or Treaty, there they obſerv'd neither Decency nor Moderation, but fell down-right a railing at each other; <hi>Pompey</hi> upbraiding <hi>Lucullus</hi> of Avarice, and <hi>Lucullus</hi> again retorting Ambition upon <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſo that their Friends could hardly part them. Now <hi>Lucullus</hi> had made a Diſtribution of all the Lands in <hi>Galatia</hi> within his Conqueſt, and gave other Largeſſes to whom he pleas'd; But <hi>Pompey</hi> encamping not far diſtant from him, ſent out his Prohibitions, whereby he forbid that any Man ſhould yield Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Lucullus;</hi> He likewiſe commanded away all his Soldiers, except only 1600, which he found were likely to be as unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to him, as they were ill-affected to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> being Proud and Mutinous. And to theſe Acts <hi>Pompey</hi> added ſome Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrical Speeches and Invectives againſt him, detracting openly from the Glory of his Actions, and giving out, That the Battels of <hi>Lucullus</hi> were but imaginary, ſuch as are repreſented in Landskips, or at beſt upon the Stage, with Kings perſonated in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies and Farces, where there was no more danger than in painted Fire, whereas the real part or brunt of the War againſt a

true and well-inſtructed Army was reſerv'd to him, for that <hi>Mithridates</hi> began now to be in earneſt, and had betaken himſelf to his Shields, Swords, and Horſes: <hi>Lucullus</hi> on the other ſide, to be even with him in ſpite, replied, That <hi>Pompey</hi> came to fight with the Image and Shadow of War, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his uſual practice, like a lazy Bird of Prey, to quarry upon Carcaſſes already ſlain, and tear in pieces the reliques of a War; For thus did he entitle and attribute to himſelf the Conqueſt of <hi>Sertorius, Lepidus,</hi> and the Accomplices of <hi>Spartacus;</hi> whereas this was the Glory of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> that of <hi>Catulus,</hi> and the firſt was to be aſcrib'd to the Prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Metellus:</hi> And therefore 'tis no great wonder, if the Glory of the <hi>Pontick</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> War, prove ſuppoſititious too, and be uſurp'd by a Man, who, by ſuch ſubtil Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices could inſinuate and work himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Honour of Triumph for a few run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agate Slaves.</p>

almoſt impregnable, which he forſook not long after as a Place deſtitute of Water; Now, no ſooner was he decamp'd, but that <hi>Pompey</hi> in the firſt place made himſelf Maſter of that Mountain, and obſerving well the nature and thriving of the Plants there, together with the hollow Beds which he found in ſeveral places, conjectur'd that ſuch a Plot could not be without Springs, and therefore he order'd them to ſink Wells in every Corner; whereby there was great plenty of Water throughout all the Camp in a little time; Inſomuch that he admir'd how it was poſſible for <hi>Mithridates</hi> to be ignorant of this, during all that time of his Encampment there. After this, <hi>Pompey</hi> purſued him to his next Camp, and there drawing a Line round about him, encamp'd himſelf, and work'd up his Trenches with Baſtions and Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers, whereby he wall'd up <hi>Mithridates</hi> within his own Camp. But he having endur'd a Siege of 45 days, made his Eſcape pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, and fled away with all the Choice of his Army, having firſt diſpatch'd all the ſick and unſerviceable Perſons in his Camp.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33760:76"/>
too, he drew up his Army in Battalia a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him at Midnight: Now, 'tis ſaid, that at that very time <hi>Mithridates</hi> ſaw a Viſion in his Dream, that did prognoſticate and foreſhew what ſhould come to paſs; for he ſeem'd to be under Sail in the <hi>Pontick</hi> Sea with a proſperous Gale, and juſt in view of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> diſcourſing pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Ships Company, as one over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd for his paſt Danger and preſent Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; when lo! of a ſudden he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſerted of all, and floating upon a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle broken Plank of the Ship in the mercy of Sea and Wind. Whilſt he was thus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under theſe Paſſions and Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms, ſome of his Friends came into his Tent, and awak'd him with the dreadful News of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s approach, telling him, that he was ſo near at hand, that now the Fight muſt be for the Camp it ſelf: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Commanders drew up all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Battel-array; <hi>Pompey</hi> perceiving how ready they were, and prepar'd for Defence, began to doubt with himſelf, whether he ſhould put it to the hazard of a Fight in the dark, judging it more conſiſtent with Policy to encompaſs them only at preſent, (leſt they ſhould fly) and give them Battel the next day, becauſe his Men were far the better Soldiers; But his ancient Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were of another opinion, and by great

Entreaties and Encouragements wrought upon him, and obtain'd that they might charge them immediately. Neither was the Night ſo very dark, but that (though the Moon was declining, yet) it gave light enough to diſcern a Body: But this rather deluded and put a Blind upon the Eye-ſight of the King's Army, for the <hi>Romans</hi> coming upon them with the Moon on their Backs, the Moon (being very low and juſt upon ſetting) caſt the Shadows a long way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bodies, and reach'd e'ne almoſt to the Enemy: This dazl'd their Eyes ſo, that they (not exactly diſcerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but imagining them to be near at hand) threw their Darts at the Shadows, without the leaſt Execution upon any one body: The <hi>Romans</hi> therefore perceiving this, ran in upon them with a great Shout; but the barbarous People, all in Amaze, being unable to endure the Charge, were fearfully routed, and put to Flight with a great Slaughter, inſomuch that above 10000 were ſlain there, and the Camp taken, As for <hi>Mithridates</hi> himſelf, he, at the beginning<note place="margin">

Among whom was his Concubine or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, <hi>Hypſicratia,</hi> a Girl always of Manly<note place="margin">Hypſicratia.</note> and daring Spirit, (and therefore the King call'd her <hi>Hypſicrates:</hi>) She being attired and mounted like a <hi>Perſian</hi> Chevalier, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compani'd the King in all his Flight, never weary even in the longeſt Journey, nor ever fail'd to attend the King in Perſon, and look after his Horſe too; until they came to <hi>Inora,</hi> a Palace or Caſtle of the King's, well ſtor'd with Gold and Jewels, and the King's chiefeſt Treaſure.

took occaſion to tell him, That as to the reſt of his Loſſes, they were chargeable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Lucullus,</hi> for that by <hi>Lucullus</hi> he had been diſpoſſeſs'd of <hi>Syria, Phaenicia, Cilicia, Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Sophene,</hi> but all that he had preſerv'd to himſelf entire till that time, he ſhould peaceably enjoy, paying the Sum of 6000 Talents as a Fine or Penalty for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that his Son ſhould have the Kingdom of <hi>Sophene.

Now this purſuit of <hi>Mithridates</hi> ſeem'd to carry great Difficulties in it, for that he had conceal'd himſelf among the Nations that inhabit about the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> and the Lake of <hi>Maeotis;</hi> and beſides, News was brought to <hi>Pompey</hi> that the <hi>Albanians</hi> had revolted again: This made him divert his Courſe, and bend his Forces againſt them with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions full of Wrath and Revenge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that he paſſed back again over the <hi>Cyrnus</hi> with great Difficulty and Danger, for that the barbarous People had fortifi'd it a great way down the Banks with Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers and Paliſado's; After this having a tedious long March to make through a thirſty and rough Country, he order'd 10000 Bottles to be fill'd with Water, and ſo advanced towards the Enemy; whom he found drawn up in order of Battel near the River <hi>Abas,</hi> to the number of 60000 Horſe and 12000 Foot, ill arm'd generally, and many of them cover'd only with the Skins of wild Beaſts: Their General was <hi>Coſis</hi> the King's Brother, who as ſoon as the Battel was begun, ſingled out <hi>Pompey,</hi> and ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon him, darted his Javelin into the Joynts of his Breaſt-plate; which <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> receiv'd, and in return, ſtruck him thro' the Body with his Launce, and ſlew him.

upon it all as a piece of Pageantry, and thinking himſelf mock'd and abus'd in it, attempted to have ſlip'd out of doors and run away; but the Servants laying hold upon him, and informing him really, that the King had beſtow'd on him the Houſe and Furniture of a rich Nobleman lately Deceaſed, and that theſe were but the firſt Fruits or ſmall Earneſts of greater Riches and Poſſeſſions that were to come, he was perſwaded at laſt with much difficulty to believe them; Thereupon putting on his Purple Robes, and mounting his Horſe, he rode through the City, crying out, <hi>All this is mine;</hi> And to thoſe that laugh'd at him, he ſaid, <hi>There was no ſuch wonder in this, but rather that he did not throw Stones at all he met, he was ſo tranſported with Joy:</hi> Such was the Parentage and Blood of <hi>Stratonice.</hi> Now ſhe deliver'd up this Caſtle into the hands of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and offer'd him many Preſents of great Value, whereof he receiv'd only ſuch as he thought might ſerve to adorn the Temples of the Gods, and add to the Splendor of his Triumph; the reſt he left to <hi>Stratonice</hi>'s Diſpoſal, bidding her to pleaſe her ſelf in the enjoyment of them.

            <p>Moreover he had a great Deſire and<note place="margin">§ II.

               <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, extending its bounds to the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea; Then thirdly, in his late purſuit of the <hi>Albanians,</hi> he wanted but little of reaching the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Sea: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he rais'd his Camp, deſigning to bring the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> within the Circuit of his Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, eſpecially for that he ſaw how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult it was to hunt after <hi>Mithridates</hi> with an Army, and that he would prove a worſe Enemy flying than fighting; But yet he declar'd, <hi>That he would leave a ſharper Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my behind him than himſelf,</hi> to wit, <hi>Famine,</hi> and therefore he appointed a Guard of Ships to lye in wait for the Merchants that ſail'd to the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> having prohibited all upon pain of Death that ſhould attempt to carry Proviſions or Merchandizes thither.</p>
            <p>Then he ſet forward with the greateſt part of his Army, and in his March he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually happen'd upon ſeveral dead Bodies of the <hi>Romans</hi> uninterr'd, which were of thoſe Soldiers that were unfortunately ſlain with <hi>Triarius</hi> in the Wars againſt <hi>Mithridates,</hi> theſe he buried all ſplendidly and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably; The neglect whereof, 'tis thought, caus'd the firſt Hatred againſt <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and alienated the Affections of the Soldiers from him. <hi>Pompey</hi> having now by his Forces<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The greateſt time that he ſpent there was in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, deciding the Controverſies of Kings and States, and where he himſelf could not be preſent in Perſon, he gave Commiſſion to his Friends and ſent them: Thus when there aroſe a Difference betwixt the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Parthians,</hi> touching the Title of a Country, and the Judgment was referr'd to him, he gave a Power by Commiſſion to three Judges and Arbiters to hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Queſtion: For the Name of his Power indeed was great; Neither were<note place="margin">His mild Temper.</note> the Vertues of his Juſtice and Clemency in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to that of his Power, whereby he cover'd a multitude of Crimes committed by his Friends and Familiars about him; for although it was not in his Nature to check or chaſtiſe an Offender, yet he would demean himſelf ſo to thoſe that addreſſed with Complaints againſt them, that the Party griev'd went always away contented, forgetting the Injuries, and patiently bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

any other Anſwer: Now, 'tis clear, that <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf render'd <hi>Demetrius</hi> leſs odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to others, by enduring his Sawcineſs and Inſolence againſt himſelf: For, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported how that <hi>Pompey,</hi> when he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited his Friends to an Entertainment, would be very Ceremonious in attending till they came and were all plac'd, whereas <hi>Demetrius</hi> would rudely ſeat himſelf at the Table with his Head cover'd even to his Ears, before any one elſe could ſit down: Moreover before his return into <hi>Italy,</hi> he had purchaſed the pleaſanteſt <hi>Villa</hi> or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Seat about <hi>Rome,</hi> with the faireſt Walks and Places for Exerciſe, and the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Gardens, call'd by the Name of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi> notwithſtanding that <hi>Pompey</hi> his Maſter was contented with a mean and thrifty Habitation till his third Conſulſhip. Afterwards, 'tis true, when he had erected that famous and ſtately Theater for the People of <hi>Rome</hi> he built (as an Appendix to it) an Houſe for himſelf much more ſplendid than his former, and yet as much beneath the ſtroke of Envy; Inſomuch as he that came to be Maſter of that Houſe after <hi>Pompey,</hi> could not but admire at it, and ſeem very Inquiſitive, <hi>Where</hi> Pompey <hi>the Great us'd to Sup?</hi> Thus are theſe things reported.</p>

            <p>Now there were various Rumours ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered<note place="margin">Disbands his Army.</note> abroad touching <hi>Pompey,</hi> and were carried to <hi>Rome</hi> before him; ſo that there was a great Tumult and Stir, as if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd forthwith to march with his Army directly into the City, and eſtabliſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Monarchy; Thereupon <hi>Craſſus</hi> withdrew himſelf, together with his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Fortunes, out of the City, either that he was really afraid, or that he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited rather (as was moſt probable) to give credit to the Calumny, and exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the malice of the People. <hi>Pompey</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as ſoon as he enter'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> called a general Muſter of the Army, and having made an Oration ſuitable to the Genius of the Time and his Soldiers, and rewarded them liberally, he commanded them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:33760:87"/>
every Man to his Country, and place of Habitation, only with this Memento, that they would not fail to meet again at his Triumph. Thus the Army being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, and the News of it commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, there happened out an admirable Paſſage; For when the Cities ſaw <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great unarm'd, and with a ſmall Train of Familiar Friends only, (as if he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from a Journey of Pleaſure, not from his Conqueſts) they came pouring in upon him out of pure Affection and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, attending and conducting him to <hi>Rome,</hi> with far greater Forces than he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, inſomuch that if he had deſign'd any Stirs or Innovation in the State, he might have done it without the Aſſiſtance of his Army. Now, becauſe the Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no Man to enter into the City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Triumph, therefore he ſent to the Senate, entreating them to prorogue the Election of Conſuls, and grant him the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that with his preſence he might coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance <hi>Piſo,</hi> one of the Candidates at that time; but this was ſharply oppos'd by <hi>Cato,</hi> whereby he fail'd of his Deſign; However, <hi>Pompey</hi> could not but admire that liberty and boldneſs of Speech in <hi>Cato,</hi> wherewith he alone above all others, durſt openly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the maintenance of Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; he therefore had a great deſire to win
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:33760:88"/>
him over, and purchaſe his Friendſhip at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rate; and to that end, <hi>Cato</hi> having two Neeces (Daughters of his Siſter) <hi>Pompey</hi> propos'd one in Marriage for himſelf, the other for his Son; But <hi>Cato</hi> ſuſpected the Motion as a colourable deſign of corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bribing his Juſtice by Alliance, and therefore would not hearken to it; which was hainouſly reſented by his Wife and Siſter, that he ſhould reject an Affinity with <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great; About that time <hi>Pompey</hi> having a deſign of ſetting up <hi>Afra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> for the Conſulſhip, gave a Sum of Money among the Tribes for their Voices, ſome whereof was receiv'd even in his own Gardens, inſomuch that when this Practice came to be bruited abroad, <hi>Pompey</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill ſpoken of, for that he who had had the Honour of that Government as a juſt Reward of his greater Merits, ſhould now make Merchandize of that very Honour, for one that had neither Vertue or Courage to deſerve it; Whereupon <hi>Cato</hi> took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to tell the Ladies, <hi>Now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>had we contracted an Alliance with</hi> Pompey, <hi>we had been allied to this Diſhonour too;</hi> which when they heard, they could not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and ſubſcribe to him, as one of a more piercing Judgment in Matters of Prudence and Morality than themſelves.</p>

But in the firſt place, there were Tables carried, wherein were written the Names and Titles of all thoſe Nations over whom he triumph'd, ſuch as were, The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Pontus, Armenia, Cappadocia, Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagonia, Media, Colchis, Iberia, Albania, Syria, Cilicia,</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> together with the Countries about <hi>Phaenicia</hi> and <hi>Palaeſtine, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea, Arabia,</hi> and all the Power of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſubdued by Sea and Land: And in theſe Countries there appeared the taking of no leſs than 1000 Caſtles, nor much leſs than 900 Cities, together with 800 Ships of the Pirates, and the Peopling of 39 Towns that lay deſolate and depopulated: Beſides, there was ſet forth in theſe Tables, an account of all the Tributes throughout the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and how that before theſe Conqueſts, the Revenue amounted but to 5000 Myriads, whereas by his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, 'twas advanced to 8500, and withal that for Advance at preſent he brought into the common Treaſury of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Money, Gold and Silver, Plate and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,

to the value of 20000 Talents, over and above that which had been diſtributed among the Soldiers, whereof he that had leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had 1500 Drachma's for his ſhare, The Priſoners of War that were led in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, beſides the Arch-Pirates, were the Son of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> with his Wife and Daughter; as alſo <hi>Zoſime,</hi> the Wife of King <hi>Tigranes</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Ariſtobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> King of <hi>Judaea.</hi> The Siſter of King <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and her five Sons; and ſome Ladies of <hi>Scythia.</hi> There were likewiſe the Hoſtages of the <hi>Albanians</hi> and <hi>Iberians;</hi> and the King of <hi>Comagena;</hi> beſides a vaſt number of Trophies, anſwering directly and deciphering out each particular Battel, in which he was Conqueror either himſelf in Perſon, or by his Lieutenants. But that that ſeem'd to be his greateſt Glory, and that no other <hi>Roman</hi> ever attain'd to, was this, That he made his third Triumph over the third part of the World; For many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans</hi> had the Honour of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing thrice; but his firſt Triumph, was over <hi>Africa,</hi> his ſecond, over <hi>Europe,</hi> and this laſt, over <hi>Aſia;</hi> ſo that he ſeem'd in theſe three Triumphs, to have led the whole World in Chains.</p>

not allow him to be quite 34, whereas in truth, at that time he was near 40: Oh that he had crowned his days, and breath'd out his laſt, even then when with <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s Age he had his Fortune too! But all the remainder of his Life-time was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unfortunate, wherein his Proſperity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came odious, and his Adverſity incurable;<note place="margin">His Change of Fortune.</note> For that great Power and Authority which he had gain'd in the City by his greater Merits, even that was made uſe of only in Patronizing the Iniquities of others, ſo that by advancing their Fortunes, he detracted from his own Glory, till at laſt he was daſhed in pieces by the force and greatneſs of his own Power: And as the ſtrongeſt Citadel or Fort in a Town, when it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd and taken by an Enemy, does then afford the ſame Strength to the Foe, as it had done to Friends before; ſo <hi>Caeſar</hi> being exalted in the State by the Power of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> overthrew and ruin'd him by the ſame Force and Arts by which he had trampled down others: And thus it came to paſs.</p>

Myſteries and Concerns both of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and Husbandman: Which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to that malicious Charge of <hi>Clodius, That the Law was not made becauſe of the Dearth or ſcarcity of Corn, but the Dearth or ſcarcity of Corn was made, that they might make a Law, whereby that Power of his, which was now grown Feeble and Conſumptive, might be reviv'd again, and</hi> Pompey <hi>reinſtated in a new Empire:</hi> Others look'd upon it as a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Device of <hi>Spinther</hi> the Couſul, whoſe Deſign it was to oblige <hi>Pompey</hi> with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority, that he himſelf might be ſent in Aſſiſtance to King <hi>Ptolomy:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this is undoubtedly true, That <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> the Tribune preferr'd a Law to diſpatch <hi>Pompey</hi> in the Nature of an Ambaſſador, without an Army, attended only with two Lictors or Vergers, as a Mediator betwixt the King and his Subjects of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Neither did this Law ſeem ungrateful to <hi>Pompey,</hi> though indeed the Senate caſt it out upon a ſpecious Pretence, That they were unwilling to hazard the Perſon of ſo brave a Man: However, there were found ſeveral Pamphlets ſcattered about the Market Place and Senate-Houſe, intimating how grateful it would be to <hi>Ptolemy</hi> to have <hi>Pompey</hi> appointed for his General inſtead of <hi>Spinther:</hi> But <hi>Timagenes</hi> relates it otherwiſe, as if <hi>Ptolomy</hi> went away and left <hi>Egypt</hi> not

            <p>Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> being appointed chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedore, and having within his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Management all the Corn Trade, ſent abroad his Factors and Agents into all Quarters, and he himſelf ſailing into <hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> made up vaſt Stores of Corn. And now being juſt ready to ſet Sail upon his Voyage homeward bound, there aroſe a mighty Storm of Wind upon the Sea, which raiſed a Doubt even among the Commanders themſelves, whether it were ſafe to break Ground or no; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf went firſt aboard, and commanded the Mariners to weigh Anchor, declaring with a loud Voice, <hi>That there was a neceſſity for them to Sail, but no neceſſity to Live:</hi> So that he by his Spirit and Courage (having met with that Fortune which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the Bold) made a proſperous Return, whereby his Granaries were ſtor'd, the

Markets all filled with Corn, and the Sea with Ships; Inſomuch that this great plenty and abundance of Proviſions yielded a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Supply, not only to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> but even Foreigners too, diſperſing it ſelf, like a lively Fountain, through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rivulets, into all Quarters of <hi>Italy.</hi>

As for the reſt of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſors, he ſent them all away full fraught with Hopes and Money; but for <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> he enter'd into private Covenants and Articles of Agreement with them, That they ſhould ſtand Candidates for the Conſulſhip next Year: That <hi>Caeſar</hi> on his part ſhould ſend a good Company of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to give their Votes at the Election: That as ſoon as they were Elected, they ſhould uſe their Intereſt to have the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of ſome Provinces and Legions aſſigned to themſelves, and that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould have his Charge now in being confirmed to him for five Years more: But afterwards when theſe Deſigns came to be diſcovered and noiſed abroad, the Matter was hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly reſented by many Perſons of the greateſt Quality in <hi>Rome;</hi> and therefore <hi>Marcellinus</hi> once in an open Aſſembly of the People, demanded of them both, <hi>Whether</hi>

               <hi>they deſigned to Sue for the Conſulſhip or no?</hi> And being urged by the People for their Anſwer, <hi>Pompey</hi> ſpake firſt and told them, <hi>Perhaps he would Sue for it, perhaps he would not;</hi> But <hi>Craſſus</hi> was ſomewhat more poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and ſaid, <hi>That for his part he would be ready to do what ſhould be judg'd moſt agreeable with the Intereſt of the Commonwealth:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Marcellinus</hi> ſtill inveighing againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> and ſeeming to reflect upon him more bitterly, <hi>Pompey</hi> replied as ſharply, <hi>That this</hi> Marcellinus <hi>was a moſt ungodly Wretch, without either Gratitude or Honour, for that by him he was made an Orator of a Mute, and of a poor Starvling, one glutted even to a Vomit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now notwithſtanding divers fell off from their Pretences, and forſook their Canvas for the Conſulſhip, yet <hi>Cato</hi> perſwaded and encouraged <hi>Lucius Domitius</hi> not to deſiſt, <hi>For that,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Conteſt now is not for Government, but for liberty againſt Tyrants and Uſurpers.</hi> Wherefore thoſe of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fearing that inflexible Conſtancy in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> (whereby he ruled and governed the whole Senate) leſt by that likewiſe he ſhould pervert and draw after him all the well-affected part of the Commonalty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to withſtand <hi>Domitius</hi> at firſt, and prevent his entrance into the Market-place; To this end therefore they ſent in a Band of

armed Men, who, at the firſt Onſet, ſlew the Torch-bearer of <hi>Domitius,</hi> as he was leading the way before him, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put all the reſt to Flight; laſt of all <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf retired, having received a Wound upon his right Arm in defence of <hi>Domitius.</hi> Thus, by theſe means and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices they obtained the Government, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed did they behave themſelves with more decency throughout all the reſt of their Actions; But in the firſt place, when the People were chooſing <hi>Cato</hi> Praetor, and juſt ready with their Votes for the Poll, <hi>Pompey</hi> broke up the Aſſembly, charging his Reaſons upon the Augury, as if there had appeared ſomething inauſpicious in the Heavens; and thereupon having corrupted the Tribes, they publickly proclaimed <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias</hi> and <hi>Vatinius,</hi> Praetors: Then in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Covenants with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> they publiſhed ſeveral Edicts by <hi>Trebonian</hi> the Tribune, whereby they made an Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Commiſſion according to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, meaſuring out another five years Charge to his former Province; To <hi>Craſſus</hi> there was appointed <hi>Syria,</hi> and the <hi>Parthian</hi> War; And to <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf all <hi>Africa,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with both <hi>Spains,</hi> and four Legions of Soldiers, whereof two he lent to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> upon his requeſt for the Wars in <hi>Gaul.</hi>

               <hi>Craſſus</hi> upon the expiration of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip, departed forthwith into his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; But <hi>Pompey</hi> ſpent ſome time in <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the opening or dedication of his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater,<note place="margin">

            <p>Theſe noble Entertainments brought him in great Eſteem with the People, whereby he was highly admired and beloved; but on the other ſide he created no leſs Envy to himſelf, in that he committed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Provinces and Legions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of Friends, as his Lieutenants, whilſt he himſelf was wantonly rambling up and down, and careſſing his Wife through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Delicacies of <hi>Italy;</hi> whether he doated upon her as a real Lover, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could not find in his Heart to leave her, who was ſuch a Lover of him? is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what<note place="margin">

            <p>From hence, the City began to waver,<note place="margin">Cauſes of the Civil War.</note> and feel new Commotions; for all things grew Tumultuous, and every Body's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe tended to Sedition, as ſoon as Death had put an end to that Relation, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had been a Diſguiſe rather than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to the Ambition of theſe Men: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, not long after came an Expreſs from <hi>Parthia</hi> with Intelligence of the Death of <hi>Craſſus</hi> there, whereby another manifeſt Obſtacle of a Civil War was taken away; for they had both an Eye thither, and that awe of him kept them together in a fair Correſpondence all his Life-time; but when Fortune had taken away this Second, whoſe Province it was to revenge the Quarrel of the Conquered, you might then ſay with the Comedian,</p>

            <p>Yet they thought the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire not ſufficient to contain them, though they were but Two.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Pompey,</hi> in an Oration to the People told them plainly, that he ever came into Office before he expected he ſhould, and that he always left it ſooner than they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he would; and indeed the disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all his Armies always witneſſed as much: Yet when he perceived that <hi>Caeſar</hi> would not ſo willingly diſcharge his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he then endeavour'd to ſtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt him by Offices and Commands in the City; neither indeed did he attempt any other Innovation; and yet all this while he would not ſeem to diſtruſt, but rather to deſpiſe and contemn him; But when he ſaw how they beſtowed the Places of Government quite contrary to his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:33760:99"/>
becauſe the Citizens were brib'd in their Elections, he left the City without any Government at all.

            <p>Afterwards when there was another A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy or Vacancy in the Government, and the Diſcourſes of a <hi>Dictator</hi> were much hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than before, thoſe of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Party fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt they ſhould make <hi>Pompey,</hi> thought it Policy to keep him from that Arbitrary and Tyrannical Power, by giving him an Office of more legal Authority; Nay, even <hi>Bibulus</hi> himſelf, who was <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Enemy, firſt gave his Vote that <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould be

Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo was very conſiderable, as well in the Honour of his Family, as that of his own Vertues; however, theſe unequal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were not very pleaſing to ſome ſort of People; for <hi>Cornelia</hi>'s Age was more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with that of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Son than his own: But the wiſer ſort thought the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns

of the City quite neglected, when he (to whom alone they had committed their broken Fortunes, and from whom alone, as from their Phyſician, they expected a cure to theſe Diſtractions) went crown'd with Garlands, and was revelling in his Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Feaſts: never conſidering, that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhip was a publick Calamity, which would never have been given him, contrary to the Rules of Law, had his Country been in a flouriſhing State. Yet afterwards he took cognizance of thoſe that got into Offices by Gifts and Bribery, and enacted Laws and Ordinances, ſetting forth the Rules and Judgment by which they ſhould be arraign'd and impleaded; thus he regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating all things with Gravity and Juſtice, gave Security, Order, and Silence to their Courts of Judicature, himſelf giving his preſence there with a Band of Soldiers.

            <p>This gave occaſion to ſome of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Friends to think it reaſonable, That ſome Conſideration ſhould be had of him too,

that prudent Conduct and Caution which had hitherto ſecured and crowned all his Actions with good Succeſs) he entertained a moſt extravagant Confidence of his own, and Contempt of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Power; inſomuch that he thought neither Force nor Care ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary againſt him, but that he could pull him down much eaſier than he had ſet him up: Beſides this, there was <hi>Appius</hi> (under whoſe Command, thoſe Legions which <hi>Pompey</hi> lent to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were returned) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lately out of <hi>Gaul,</hi> very much vilified <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Actions there, and gave out ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Reports in derogation of his Honour, telling <hi>Pompey, That he was unacquainted with his own Strength and Reputation, if he made uſe of any other Forces againſt</hi> Caeſar <hi>than his own, for ſuch was the Soldiers Hatred to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>and their Love to</hi> Pompey <hi>ſo great, that they would all come over to him upon his firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Appearance.</hi> By theſe Flatteries was <hi>Pompey</hi> ſtrangely pufft up, and his Confidence had wrought him into ſuch a careleſs Security, that he could not chooſe but laugh at thoſe who ſeem'd to fear a War: And when ſome were ſaying, That if <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould bend his Forces againſt the City, they could not ſee what Power was able to reſiſt him, he reply'd with a ſcornful Smile, bidding them take no care of that, for, ſaid he, <hi>Whene'er I ſtamp with my Foot in any part of</hi> Italy, <hi>there will</hi>

he bid <hi>Pompey ſtamp upon the ground, and call forth the Forces he had promis'd.</hi> But <hi>Pompey</hi> very patiently bore with all this unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Railery; ſo that <hi>Cato</hi> putting him in mind of what he had foretold from the very beginning touching <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he made this Anſwer only, <hi>That</hi> Cato <hi>indeed had ſpoke more like a Prophet, but he had acted more like a Friend.

Sea and Land, that he was forc'd to deſire Battel, daily provoking the Enemy, and aſſailing them in their very Forts; and in theſe light Skirmiſhes for the moſt part had the better, only once he was dangerouſly overthrown, and likely to have loſt his whole Army: For <hi>Pompey</hi> having valiantly re-inforced the Battel, made a deſperate Charge upon him, even to a total Rout of all his Army, and the Slaughter of 2000 upon the Place; but either he was not able to force their Camp, or he was afraid to fall in pell-mell together with them: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as <hi>Caeſar</hi> told ſome of his Friends, <hi>How that day had given an abſolute Conqueſt to the Enemy, if they had had but a Man that knew how to Conquer.

               <hi>Pompey</hi> had all along hitherto by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, pretty well quieted his Soldiers; but after this laſt Engagement, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> for want of Proviſions was forc'd to raiſe his Camp, and had paſſed through <hi>Athama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> it was impoſſible to curb or allay the heat of their Spirits any longer; For all crying out with a general Voice, <hi>That</hi> Caeſar <hi>is fled,</hi> ſome were for purſuing and preſſing upon him; others for return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Italy;</hi> ſome there were that ſent their Friends and Servants before hand to <hi>Rome,</hi> to hire Houſes near the <hi>Forum</hi> or Market-place, whereby they might be in a readineſs to ſue for Offices and Places in the Government: But ſeveral were ſo vain as to ſail for <hi>Lesbos,</hi> in a Compliment to <hi>Cornelia,</hi> with this joyful News, <hi>That the War was brought to an end;</hi> (for <hi>Pompey</hi> had privately convey'd her thither from the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults in <hi>Rome.</hi>) Hereupon a Council of War was call'd, and the Matter being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate, <hi>Afranius</hi> was of Opinion, <hi>That</hi> Italy <hi>ſhould firſt be regain'd, for that it was the grand Prize and Crown of all the War;</hi> and withal they who were Maſters of that,

Charge, or make any longer Reſiſtance, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when they ſaw themſelves out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted in their own Stratagem, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvented in that Ambuſh, by which they deſign'd to have inveſted the Enemy: Thus theſe being likewiſe routed and put to flight, when <hi>Pompey</hi> ſaw it, and by the Duſt flying in the Air, conjectur'd the ſame Fate of his Horſe too, it were very hard to expreſs his thoughts at that time, but he look'd more like one diſtracted and beſides himſelf, than one that ſhould have call'd to mind that he was <hi>Pompey the Great;</hi> and therefore he retired ſlowly towards his Camp, without ſpeaking a word to any Man, behaving himſelf exactly according to the deſcription in theſe Verſes,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>When <hi>Jove</hi> from Heav'n ſtrook <hi>Ajax</hi> with a fear,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ajax</hi> the bold, he ſtood aſtoniſh'd there,</l>
               <l>And trembling gaz'd about without a Shield or Spear.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>In this ſtate and condition he went into his own Tent, and ſate him down ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtill, until ſome of the Enemies fell in together with his Men that were flying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Camp, and then he let fall only this one word, <hi>What? into the very Camp?</hi> and ſaid no more, but roſe up, and putting on a Garment ſuitable to his preſent Fortune, departed ſecretly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:33760:116"/>By this time the reſt of the Army was put to flight, and there was a great Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Camp among the Servants, and thoſe that guarded the Tents; but of the Soldiers themſelves, there were not above 6000 ſlain, as 'tis reported by <hi>Aſinius Pollio,</hi> who was himſelf a Voluntier in this Fight of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Party. When <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Soldiers had taken the Camp, they ſaw clearly the Folly and Vanity of the Enemy; for all their Tents and Pavilions were richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with Garlands of Myrtle, painted Carpets and Hangings, their Couches ſtrow'd with Flowers, and their Tables ſet full of Bowls and Glaſſes, and thoſe even crown'd with Wine; nay, their fooliſh hopes had puff'd them up with ſuch vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that their whole Preparation and Furniture was of People going to Feaſt and Sacrifice, rather than of Men well-arm'd and appointed for the Battel.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pompey</hi> had got a little way from the Camp, he diſmounted and forſook his Horſe, having but a ſmall Retinue with him, and finding that no Man purſu'd him, walk'd on ſoftly a foot, taken up altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with thoughts, ſuch as probably might poſſeſs any Man of his Quality and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, a Man that for the ſpace of 34 Years together, had been accuſtomed to Conqueſt and Victory, and was then at
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:33760:117"/>
laſt in his old Age beginning to know the Calamities of War in Slaughter and Flight: And it was no ſmall Affliction to conſider, that he had loſt in one hour all that Glory and Power which he had been getting in ſo many Wars and bloody Battels, and that he, who but a little before was guarded with ſuch an Army of Foot, ſo many Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Horſe, and ſuch a mighty Fleet, was now flying in ſo mean a condition, and with ſuch a ſlender Retinue, that his very Enemies who ſought him could not know him. Thus when he had paſſed by the City of <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> and came into the Fields of <hi>Tempe,</hi> he being very thirſty, kneel'd down and drank out of the River; then riſing up again, he paſſed through thoſe Valleys, until he came to the Sea-ſide, and there he betook himſelf to a poor Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Cottage, where he lodg'd all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Night: The next Morning about break of day he went into a little Boat upon the River, and taking his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men along with him, diſmiſſed the reſt of his Servants, adviſing them to go boldly to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and not be afraid: As he was rowing up and down near the Shore, he chanc'd to ſpy a great Ship of Burthen riding at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and juſt ready to ſet Sail; the Maſter whereof was call'd by the Name of <hi>Petitius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, who, though he was not
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:33760:117"/>
familiary acquainted with <hi>Pompey,</hi> yet he knew him very well by ſight: Now it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that this <hi>Petitius</hi> dream'd the Night before that he ſaw <hi>Pompey,</hi> not like the Man he had often ſeen him, but in a deſpicable condition, and diſconſolate, and in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture was diſcourſing with him: He was then telling his Dream to the Paſſengers, (as Men commonly do that are at leiſure, and eſpecially Dreams of that conſequence) when of a ſudden one of the Mariners told him, he ſaw a little Boat with Oars putting off from Shore, and that ſome of the Men there ſhook their Garments, and held out their Hands, with Signs to take them in: Thereupon <hi>Petitius</hi> ſtanding up, knew him immediately, ſeeing him in the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe as he appear'd in his Dream, and ſmiting his Hand on his Head, order'd the Mariners to let down the Ships Boat, he himſelf lending his Hand, and calling him by the Name of <hi>Pompey;</hi> in that he was already aſſur'd of his Change, and the change of his Fortune, by that of his Garb: So that without any farther Entreaty or Diſcourſe, he took him into his Ship, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch of his Company as he thought fit, and hois'd Sail: There were with him, the two <hi>Len<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uli</hi> and <hi>Favonius;</hi> and a little after they ſpy'd King <hi>Deiotarus</hi> making up towards them from a-ſhore, ſo they ſtayed
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:33760:118"/>
and took him in along with them: At Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time, the Maſter of the Ship having made ready<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch Proviſions as he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, <hi>Pompey,</hi> for want of his Servants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> began to waſh himſelf, which when <hi>Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> perceiv'd, he ran to him, waſh'd and anointed him; and always after continu'd to wait upon, and attend him in all things, as Servants do their Maſters, even to the waſhing of his Feet, and providing of his Supper. Inſomuch that one there preſent, obſerving that free and unaffected Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in his Services, broke out into theſe words,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Lord! in the noble and the fair,</l>
               <l>How graceful all things do appear!</l>
            </lg>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> ſailing by the City of <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> coaſted over from thence to <hi>Mitylene,</hi> with a deſign to take in <hi>Cornelia</hi> and his Son; as<note place="margin">Lesbos.</note> ſoon as he arriv'd at the Port in that Iſland, he diſpatch'd a Meſſenger into the City, with News very different from <hi>Cornelia</hi>'s Expectation; for ſhe, by all the former Meſſengers and Letters ſent to pleaſe her, had been put in hopes that the War was ended at <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> and that there was nothing more remaining for <hi>Pompey,</hi> but the Chace of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> The Meſſenger find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in the ſame Hopes ſtill, was not
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:33760:118"/>
able to ſalute or ſpeak to her, but declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatneſs of her Misfortune by his Tears rather than by his words, deſir'd her to make haſte if ſhe would ſee <hi>Pompey,</hi> with one Ship only, and that none of his own: The young Lady hearing this, fell down all along in a Swoon, and continu'd ſo a long time ſenſleſs and ſpeechleſs; ſhe was ſcarce well recover'd of her Senſes again, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious to her ſelf that this was no time for Lamentation and Tears ſhe ſtarted up and ran through the City towards the Sea-ſide, where <hi>Pompey</hi> meeting and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing her in his Arms, (as ſhe was juſt fainting away and falling into a Swoon) ſhe vented her paſſion in this manner: <hi>This is the effect of my Fortune, dear Sir, not of yours, that I ſee you thus dejected and reduced to one poor Veſſel, who, before your Marriage with the unfortunate</hi> Cornelia, <hi>was wont to ride Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of theſe Seas, with a Fleet of 500 Sail; why therefore ſhould you come to ſee me, or why not rather have left her to a ſeverer Fate, who has been the Cauſe and Author of all your Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes? How happy a Woman had I been, if I had breath'd out my laſt before that fatal News from</hi> Parthia, <hi>of the Death of</hi> Publius, <hi>to whom I was wedded in my Virginity? and how pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if I had follow'd his Deſtiny, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd? But I was reſerv'd for a greater Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, even the ruine of</hi> Pompey the Great.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:33760:119"/>
Thus, they ſay, <hi>Cornelia</hi> ſpoke to him, and this was <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Reply: <hi>Dear</hi> Cornelia, <hi>Thou haſt hitherto known only one kind Fortune, which perhaps has deceiv'd thee in this, that ſhe has been conſtant to me beyond her uſual Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom; but it behoves us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are Mortals born, to bear with theſe Afflictions, and try our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune once again; neither ought we to deſpond, and reſt hopeleſs, for that 'tis as poſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve our former Happineſs from this unlucky ſtate, as it was to fall from that, into this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Calamity.</hi> Thereupon ſhe ſent for her Goods and Servants out of the City; the Citizens alſo of <hi>Mitylene</hi> came out to ſalute and invite <hi>Pompey</hi> into the City; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, adviſing them to be obedient to the Conqueror, and fear not, for that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was a Man of great Goodneſs and Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: Then turning to <hi>Cratippus</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, (who came among the reſt out of the City to viſit him) he began to repine, and argue ſomewhat with him touching the Diſpenſations of Providence; but <hi>Cratippus</hi> very modeſtly declin'd the Diſpute, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in better Hopes only, leſt by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, he might ſeem too ſharp or unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable: For when <hi>Pompey</hi> had put him a certain Queſtion touching Providence, and demonſtrated how neceſſary it was, that the Commonwealth ſhould be turn'd into a Monarchy, becauſe of their ill Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:33760:119"/>
in the State; he return'd the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>But how, oh</hi> Pompey! <hi>and by what to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or aſſurance may we be induc'd to believe, that if the Victory had been thine, thou wouldſt have us'd thy Fortune better than</hi> Caeſar? But Providence is a point of Divinity belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gods, and ought to be let alone to act after its own method.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> having taken his Wife and<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> Friends aboard, ſet Sail, making no Port, nor touching any where, but when he was neceſſitated to take in Proviſions, or freſh Water: The firſt Place he arriv'd at was <hi>Attalia,</hi> a City in <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> and whilſt he was there, there came ſome Gallies thither to him out of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> together with a few Bands of Soldiers, and there he had almoſt 60 Senators with him again: Then hearing that his Navy was ſafe too, and that <hi>Cato</hi> had rallied a conſiderable Body of Soldiers after their Overthrow, and paſs'd with them over into <hi>Africa,</hi> he began to complain and blame himſelf and his Friends too, in that they had forc'd him to engage by Land, without making uſe of his other Forces, (in which he was undoubtedly the ſtronger) and had not kept near enough to his Fleet, that failing by Land, he might have rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced his Troops from the Sea, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drawn out a Power equal and able enough to encounter the Enemy; ſo that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:33760:120"/>
in truth, neither did <hi>Pompey</hi> during all the War commit a greater Overſight, nor <hi>Caeſar</hi> uſe a more ſubtil Stratagem, than by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fight ſo far off from their Naval Forces.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Pompey</hi> being at preſent conſtrain'd to attempt and act ſomewhat according to his ſmall Ability, he diſpatch'd his Agents as Ambaſſadors to ſome of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cities, and himſelf ſail'd about in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to others, requiring their Aid in Money and Soldiers to Victual and Man out his Ships; however, fearing leſt the ſudden Approach of the Enemy might prevent his Preparations, he began to conſider what Place would yield him the ſafeſt Refuge and Retreat at preſent: Thereupon a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult being held, it was generally agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That no Province of the <hi>Romans</hi> was ſecure enough; and touching Foreign King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, he himſelf was of opinion, That <hi>Parthia</hi> muſt needs be the fitteſt both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and defend them in their preſent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, as well as to aid and furniſh them with the greateſt Forces: Others of the Council were for going into <hi>Africa,</hi> and to King <hi>Juba;</hi> but <hi>Theophanes,</hi> the <hi>Lesbian,</hi> thought it madneſs to leave <hi>Aegypt</hi> (that was but a Voyage of three days Sailing) and forſake <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (who was juſt come of Age, and highly oblig'd to him for that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:33760:120"/>
Friendſhip and Favour which he had lately ſhewn to his Father) only to put himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Parthian,</hi> and truſt the moſt Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nation in the World: Or what is worſe, to ſubject himſelf to the Tyranny of <hi>Arſaces</hi> the King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> and make him his Lord (a Power which he was not able to compaſs in the Life-time of <hi>Craſſus</hi>) rather than try the Clemency of a Generous <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and one that had been his Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Law, to whom, if he would but yield to be Second, he might aſſure himſelf to be the firſt and chief over all the reſt: Beſides, he thought it would be great Cruelty to expoſe a young Lady, deſcended from the Noble Family of the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, among ſuch a barbarous People, who govern by their Luſts, and meaſure their Greatneſs by their Power, to commit Affronts and Inſolencies; from whom, though ſhe ſuffer no Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet it would be thought ſhe did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Hands of thoſe who had the power to do it: This Argument alone, they ſay, was ſo perſwaſive, as to divert his Courſe, that was deſign'd towards <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> if it were ſo indeed that any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, and not his own Fate, made him take this other way. As ſoon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as 'twas reſolv'd upon, that he ſhould fly into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he ſetting Sail from <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in a Galley of <hi>Seleucia,</hi> together with <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia,</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:33760:121"/>
(and the reſt of his Company, ſome in Long-Boats, and others in Ships of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſailing by) paſs'd over the Sea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger. But when he underſtood that King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was ſate down with his Army in the City of <hi>Peluſium,</hi> making War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Siſter, he ſteer'd his Courſe that way, and ſent a Meſſenger before to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King with his Arrival, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave his Protection: <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himſelf was a very young Man; and therefore <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinus,</hi> the principal Miniſter of State, (having the ſole Adminiſtration of all Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in the Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) call'd a Council of the chiefeſt Men at Court (thoſe being the greateſt whom he pleas'd to make ſo) and commanded them every Man to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Opinion touching the Reception of <hi>Pompey:</hi> Now, 'twas a horrid thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That the Fate of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great ſhould be determin'd by ſuch a Crew, as <hi>Pothinus</hi> an Eunuch, <hi>Theodotus</hi> of <hi>Chios,</hi> a mercenary Rhetorician, that taught Oratory, as a Schoolmaſter, for Reward, and <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> an <hi>Aegyptian;</hi> for theſe, with others of his Bed-Chamber, and ſome of thoſe who had a ſhare in his Education, were the chief and leading Men in the Council; <hi>Pompey</hi> (who thought it diſhonourable to owe his Safety to <hi>Caeſar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>) riding at Anchor a great way diſtant from Shore, was forc'd to wait
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:33760:121"/>
the Reſult of this honourable Council: It ſeems they were different in their Opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some were for ſending the Man away, and others again for calling and receiving him; but <hi>Theodotus,</hi> to ſhew the power of his Eloquence and Rhetorick, undertook to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, That neither the one nor the other was ſafe in that Juncture of Affairs; for if they entertain'd him, they would be ſure to make <hi>Caeſar</hi> their Enemy, and <hi>Pompey</hi> their Maſter; Or if they diſmiſs'd him, they might render themſelves hereafter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to <hi>Pompey</hi> for that inhoſpitable Expulſion, and to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for the Eſcape; ſo that the moſt expedient Advice would be to ſend and take away his Life, for by that means they would ingratiate themſelves with the one, and have no reaſon to fear the other; adding, as 'tis reported, with a Smile, <hi>That a dead Man cannot bite.</hi> This Advice being approv'd of, they committed the execution of it to <hi>Achillas:</hi> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking with him as his Accomplices, one <hi>Septimius,</hi> a Man that had formerly commanded a Brigade under <hi>Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Salvius,</hi> another Centurion, with three or four Officers more, made up towards <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s Galley; in the mean time, all the chiefeſt of thoſe who accompanied <hi>Pompey</hi> in this Voyage, were come into his Ship to ſee the event of their Embaſſie: But when
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:33760:122"/>
they ſaw the manner of their Reception, that in appearance it was neither Princely, nor Honourable, nor indeed any ways an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Hopes of <hi>Theophanes,</hi> or their Expectation (for there came but a few Men in a Fiſherman's Boat to meet them) they began to ſuſpect the meaneſs of their Entertainment, and gave warning to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> that he ſhould turn back, whilſt he was out of their reach, and launch out into the main Sea: By this time the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Boat drew near, and <hi>Septimius</hi> ſtanding up firſt, ſaluted <hi>Pompey</hi> in the Latin Tongue, by the Title of <hi>Imperator,</hi> or General: Then <hi>Achillas</hi> ſaluting him in the Greek Language, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd him to come aboard his Veſſel, telling him, That the Sea was very ſhallow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Shore, and that a Galley of that Burthen could not avoid ſtriking upon ſome Shelve or Quick-ſand: At the ſame time they ſaw ſeveral of the King's Galleys well mann'd, and all the Shore cover'd with Soldiers; ſo that if they had chang'd their Minds, it ſeem'd impoſſible for them to eſcape; and beſides, their Diſtruſt would have giv'n the Aſſaſſinates a colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for their Cruelty. <hi>Pompey</hi> therefore taking his leave of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> who lamented his Death before-hand, bid two Centurions, (<hi>Philip,</hi> one of his Free-men, and a Slave call'd <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:33760:122"/>
Boat before him; and as ſome of the Ships Crew belonging to <hi>Achillas,</hi> were reaching out their Hands to help him, he turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout towards his Wife and Son, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Iambicks of <hi>Sophocles.</hi>

            </lg>
            <p>Theſe were the laſt words he ſpoke to his Friends, and ſo he went aboard. When <hi>Pompey</hi> perceiv'd that, (notwithſtanding there was a conſiderable diſtance betwixt his Galley and the Shore, and yet none of the Ships Company had ſpoke a kind word to him all the way, he look'd earneſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Septimius,</hi> and ſpoke to him, <hi>Methinks I ſhould know thee, Friend, have not we been formerly Fellow-Soldiers, and ſerv'd together in the Wars?</hi> But he only nodded with his Head, making no Reply at all, nor ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other manner of Civility: Since therefore they continu'd ſilent, <hi>Pompey</hi> took a little Book in his Hand (wherein was written a Greek Oration, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for King <hi>Ptolomy</hi>) and began to read it; Afterwards, when they drew near to the Shore, <hi>Cornelia,</hi> (together with the reſt of her Friends in the Galley, was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to ſee the Event, and began to take Courage at laſt, when ſhe ſaw ſeveral of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:33760:123"/>
the Court coming to meet him, imagining that it might be for a more honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; but, in the mean time, as <hi>Pompey</hi> took <hi>Philip</hi> by the hand, to riſe up more eaſily, <hi>Septimius</hi> came firſt of all behind<note place="margin">His Death.</note> with his Sword, and run him thorow; next after him likewiſe <hi>Salvius</hi> and <hi>Achillas</hi> drew out their Swords. Wherefore <hi>Pompey</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Gown with both Hands, hid his Face, and neither ſaying nor doing any thing unworthy of himſelf (only groaning a little) manfully endur'd the Wounds they gave him; and ſo ended his Life in the <hi>59th</hi> Year of his Age, the very next day after the day of his Birth. <hi>Cornelia,</hi> with her Company from the Gallies, ſeeing him Murder'd, gave ſuch a Shriek, that it was heard to the Shore, and weighing Anchor with all ſpeed, they hoiſted Sail, and fled: The Wind ſerv'd them favourably from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, and aſſiſted their Flight with a brisk Gale, whereby they preſently got the main Sea, ſo that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> failing of their aim, deſiſted from purſuing them.

and having nothing elſe, he wrapt it up in one of his own Shirts for a Winding-ſheet; then ſeeking up and down about the Sands, at laſt he found ſome rotten Planks of a little Fiſher-Boat, not much, but yet enough to make up a Funeral Pile for a naked Body, and that not quite entire: As <hi>Philip</hi> was buſie in gathering and putting theſe old Planks together, an old <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, who from his Youth had ſerv'd in the Wars under <hi>Pompey,</hi> came to him and demanded, <hi>Who he was that was preparing the Funerals of</hi> Pompey the Great?

The next day <hi>Lucius Lentulus</hi> not knowing what had paſs'd, came ſailing from <hi>Cyprus</hi> along the Shore of that Coaſt, and ſeeing a Funeral Pile, and <hi>Philip</hi> (whom he did not know at firſt) ſtanding by, ask'd him, <hi>Who it was that was dead and buried there?</hi> But pauſing a little with himſelf, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a deep Sigh, <hi>Perhaps,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>even thou O</hi> Pompey <hi>the Great,!</hi> and ſo going aſhore, he was preſently apprehended and Slain; This was the unfortunate End of <hi>Pompey the Great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>Caeſar</hi> coming into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (that was then in very great Troubles) ſhew'd a great abhorrence of the Perſon that preſented him with <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Head, turning away from him as a moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſaſſinate; but when he receiv'd his Seal, (whereon was Engraven a Lyon hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sword in his Paw) he burſt out into Tears. <hi>Achillas</hi> and <hi>Pothinus</hi> he put to Death; and King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himſelf being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown in Battel upon the Banks of <hi>Nilus,</hi> fled away in diſguiſe, and was never heard of afterwards. <hi>Theodotus,</hi> the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rician, flying out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> eſcap'd the hands of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Juſtice, but liv'd a Vagabond in Baniſhment, wandring up and down, deſpis'd and hated of all Men, till at laſt <hi>Marcus Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (after he had kill'd <hi>Caeſar</hi>) finding him in his Province of <hi>Aſia,</hi> put him to Death, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt made him ſuffer the moſt exquiſite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Torments he could invent.

               <head>THE PARALLEL OF POMPEY WITH AGESILAUS,</head>
               <p>THus having drawn out the Hiſtory or Lives of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> the next thing is to compare them, and in order to the Parallel wherein they agree, we'll take a curſory View, and touch upon ſome few Paſſages that make the difference, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherein they chiefly diſagree; which are theſe: In the firſt place, <hi>Pompey</hi> attain'd to all his Greatneſs and Glory by the juſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his own Integrity, and ſo was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd by himſelf; having often and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately engag'd together with <hi>Sylla,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering <hi>Italy,</hi> from the Uſurpation of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants:
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:33760:125"/>
But <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> appears to have uſurp'd a Kingdom, not without offence to the Laws, both of Gods and Men; Of theſe, by giving Judgment of Baſtardy againſt <hi>Leoty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chides,</hi> the natural and lawful Son of his Brother, as appear'd by undoubted Evidence; Of thoſe, by putting a falſe Gloſs upon the Oracle of the Gods, and eluding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in the point of Lameneſs. Secondly, <hi>Pompey</hi> had a perpetual Veneration for <hi>Sylla</hi> all his Life-time, and expreſs'd as much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Death, by making an honourable Inrerment of his Corps in deſpight of <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and giving his Daughter in Marriage to his Son <hi>Fauſtus:</hi> But <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> upon a ſlight pretence caſt off <hi>Lyſander</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Diſhonour. So that in point of gratitude, <hi>Sylla</hi> receiv'd in return from <hi>Pompey</hi> no leſs than he gave him, whereas <hi>Lyſander</hi> made <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and General of all <hi>Greece:</hi> Thirdly, Thoſe Tranſgreſſions of <hi>Pompey</hi> againſt the State and Laws, were occaſion'd chiefly by his Relations (for that moſt of his Errors had ſome Affinity, as well as himſelf, to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> they being both his Fathers-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law:) But <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> to gratifie the Amours or Luſt of his Son, ſav'd the Life of <hi>Spho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> by Violence, when he deſerv'd Death for thoſe injuries he had done to the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> and 'tis manifeſt that he was openly
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:33760:125"/>
and cordially an Abettor to <hi>Phaebida,</hi> (in the breach of the League with the <hi>Thebans</hi>) barely for the Iniquity of the Act it ſelf. In ſhort, what Miſchief ſoever might be charg'd upon <hi>Pompey,</hi> as done through Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty or Inadvertency againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, the very ſame were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> againſt the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> out of Obſtinacy and Malice, he himſelf being the Incendiary of the <hi>Baeotian</hi> War: And if by chance there was any thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Offences of theſe two, that of <hi>Pompey</hi> was unexpected to the <hi>Romans;</hi> whereas <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> would not ſuffer the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi> to avoid what they foreſaw and heard muſt attend a lame or decrepit King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; For had <hi>Leotychides</hi> been chargeable ten thouſand times as foreign and ſpurious, yet the Race of the <hi>Eurityontidae</hi> was ſtill in being, and there never could have been wanting one deſcended from that Line, to furniſh <hi>Sparta</hi> with a natural and lawful King, and one that was entire in his Limbs too, had not <hi>Lyſander</hi> darkned and diſguis'd the true ſence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then I muſt needs commend this as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Act of civil Vertue and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> That immediately upon the receipt of the <hi>Scytala</hi> (or ſcrowl of Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a Countermand from the <hi>Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi>) he left the Wars in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and return'd into his Country; for that he did not act generally, as <hi>Pompey</hi> did, (in thoſe things by which he made himſelf Great) for the intereſt and benefit of the Commonwealth; who, for his Countries ſake, laid aſide as great Authority and Honour, as ever any Man had before or ſince, except <hi>Alexander the Great:</hi> But now for ſome other Head.</p>
               <p>And if well take a view of <hi>Pompey</hi> in his Military Expeditions and Exploits of War,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:33760:126"/>
in the number of Trophies, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Armies which he Commanded, together with the multitude of Battels in which he triumph'd as a Conqueror, I am perſwaded even <hi>Xenophon</hi> himſelf would not put the Victories of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> in Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with his, though he has this Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge allow'd him, (as a ſingular Reward for all his other Vertues) that he may write and ſpeak in favour of his Hero what-e're he pleaſes. Methinks too there is a great deal of difference betwixt theſe Men in their Clemency and Moderation towards their Enemies; For whilſt <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conqueſt of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Meſſene,</hi> (this being the entire Lot of his own <note n="*" place="margin">Sicily.</note> Country, and that the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of <hi>Baeotia</hi>) he had almoſt loſt <hi>Sparta</hi> it ſelf, but did really loſe the Government of <hi>Greece;</hi> whereas <hi>Pompey</hi> gave Cities to thoſe of the Pirates who were willing to change their manner of Life; And when 'twas in his power to have led <hi>Tigranes,</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> in Triumph, he choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make him a Confederate of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That he preferr'd an eternal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour before the Glories of one day.</hi> But if the Preheminence, in that which chiefly relates to the Office of a General, (conſiſting of a ſteady reſolution upon the wiſeſt Acts and Counſels of War) might be given to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:33760:127"/>
of the beſt Conduct, the <hi>Lacedaemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> would not a little exceed the <hi>Roman</hi> in that; for <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> never deſerted his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though it was Beſieg'd by an Army of 70000 Men, when there were very few Soldiers within to defend it, and thoſe had been baffled too but a little before at the Battel of <hi>Leuctra:</hi> But <hi>Pompey</hi> (when <hi>Caeſar</hi> with a Body only of 5300 Men, had taken but one Town in <hi>Italy</hi>) departed timorouſly out of <hi>Rome,</hi> either through Cowardice, when they were ſo few, or at leaſt through a vain imagination, that there were more; and having convey'd away his Wife and Children, he left all the reſt of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens defenceleſs, and fled; whereas he ought either to have conquer'd in Fight for the defence of his Country, or yielded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on terms to the Conqueror, for he was his Fellow-Citizen, and Ally'd to him: But now to that ſame Man, (to whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd an Enlargement in the term of his Government, and thought it intolerable to grant another Couſulſhip) even to him he gave a Power, (by letting him take the City) to tell <hi>Metellus</hi> the Tribune, together with all the reſt, <hi>That they were his Priſoners.</hi> That therefore, which is chiefly the Office of a General, to put the Enemy upon a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Fight, when he finds himſelf the the ſtronger, and to avoid it when he is the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:33760:127"/>
weaker; that Property being ſingular in <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> he always kept himſelf Invincible: And this was <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Talent too, that when he was the weaker, he could at any time by fencing with <hi>Pompey,</hi> decline the Danger; and when he was the ſtronger, he forc'd him to Battel by Land, even to the hazard of all, whereby he became the Maſter of the Treaſury, Stores, and the Sea too, which were all in his Enemies hands, and by which he had his conſtant Supplies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fighting. Now, that which is alledg'd as an Apology, in vindication of <hi>Pompey,</hi> is the greateſt Crime in ſo great a General; for 'tis a true, for a young Commander by Tumults and Noiſe to be wrought into a Fear and Eaſineſs, whereby he may forſake the ſafeſt Counſels, is neither ſtrange, nor altogether unpardonable; But for <hi>Pompey the Great,</hi> whoſe Camp the <hi>Romans</hi> call'd their Country, and his Tent the Senate, ſtyling the Conſuls, Praetors, and all other Magiſtrates, (that had taken upon them the Adminiſtration of the Government at <hi>Rome</hi>) by no better Title than that of Rebels and Traytors; for him, I ſay, whom they well knew, never to have been under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of any but himſelf, (having nobly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd his courſe of Warfare under himſelf, as ſole General in all the Wars he made) who could excuſe him, that upon ſo ſmall
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:33760:128"/>
a Provocation (as the Scoffs of <hi>Favonius</hi> and <hi>Domitius,</hi> and leſt he ſhould bare the Nickname of <hi>Agamemnon</hi>) ſhould be wrought upon, and even forc'd to hazard the whole Empire and Liberty of <hi>Rome</hi> upon the caſt of a Dye? In him, I ſay, 'twas intolerable, who, if he had ſo much regarded a preſent Infamy, ſhould have guarded the City at firſt with his Arms, and fought valiantly in defence of <hi>Rome,</hi> not have left it as he did, colouring his Flight over with the Stratagem of <hi>Themiſtocles;</hi> and yet after all this, to imagine that there could be any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach in a wary Delay before the Battel in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> was as inexcuſable: For neither did God appoint the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> Fields, to be the Stage and Theater upon which they ſhould contend for the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither was he ſummon'd thither by any Herald upon Challenge, with intimation, that he muſt either undergo the Combat, or ſurrender the Crown to another; But there were many other Fields, thouſands of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and even the whole Earth, that he might have had by the Advantage of his Fleet, and Forces at Sea, if he would but have follow'd the Examples of <hi>Maximus, Marius, Lucullus,</hi> and even <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> himſelf; who endur'd no leſs Tumults within the City of <hi>Sparta,</hi> when the <hi>Thebans</hi> provok'd him to Battel for the reſidue of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:33760:128"/>
He endur'd likewiſe many Calumnies and Accuſations in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> through the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence of the King there, entreating his patience conſtantly; but following always what he had determined in his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon mature Advice, he did by that means, not only preſerve the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills, not only keep <hi>Sparta</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon its Legs, even in thoſe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Convulſions, but ſet up Trophies likewiſe in the City againſt the <hi>Thebans,</hi> giving them afterwards an occaſion of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, in that he did not at that time lead them out, as they would have forc'd him, to their deſtruction; inſomuch, that at laſt <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was highly commended, even of thoſe who provok'd their own Ruine, after they found he had ſav'd their Lives againſt their wills: Whereas <hi>Pompey</hi> (whoſe Errors had always ſome other Authors) found thoſe to be his Accuſers, upon whom he had plac'd his chiefeſt confidence; and ſome ſay, that he was deceiv'd by his Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law <hi>Scipio,</hi> for that he, (deſigning to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal and keep to himſelf the greateſt part of that Treaſure, which he had brought out of <hi>Aſia</hi>) did preſs <hi>Pompey</hi> to Battel, upon this pretence, that there would be a want of Money; however, admitting this to be true, yet ſuch a General ought not to have been ſo eaſily deluded, and led into an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:33760:129"/>
even to the hazard of all the greateſt Concerns in the Common-wealth: And thus we have taken a view of each, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them together in their Conduct and Actions in War. As to their Voyages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aegypt:</hi> One ſteer'd his Courſe thither out of neceſſity in Flight; the other nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honourably, nor of neceſſity, but as a Mercenary Soldier, having liſted himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Service of a barbarous Nation for Pay, that he might be able to wage War upon the <hi>Graecians:</hi> Laſtly, That which we charge upon the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in the Name of <hi>Pompey,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> return again in an Accuſation againſt <hi>Ageſilaus;</hi> For one was barbarouſly betray'd and murder'd by thoſe whom he truſted: The other betray'd his Truſt, and deſerted them, having upon his Revolt gone over to the Enemy, (that was now making War upon <hi>Aegypt</hi>) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he came at firſt, as an Auxiliary to the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>

But afterwards having ſome miſtruſt of him, yet not ſo far as to do him any Prejudice, his Familiarity and friendly Kindneſs to him abated ſo much, as to make it evident he was very indifferent to him.

But he rejected this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel as weak and timorous, and look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to be more Prudence to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Reſolution and Magnanimity, than by ſeeming to truckle to any, hazard the bringing all his Enemies upon him at once. In purſuit of this opinion, he kept the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> quiet, by making a ſudden Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into their Country, as far as the River<note place="margin">He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the <hi>Triballians.</hi>

From hence he advanced into <hi>Paphlagonia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> both which Countries he ſoon reduc'd to his obedience, and then hearing of the Death of <hi>Memnon,</hi> one of <hi>Darius</hi> his beſt Sea-Commanders, who, if he had lived, might have put a great ſtop to the progreſs of his Arms, he was the rather induc'd to carry the War into the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Provinces of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius</hi> was by this time upon his March<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> marches to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards him.</note> from <hi>Suſa,</hi> very confident, not only in the number of his Men, which amounted to fix hundred thouſand, but likewiſe in a dream which the Magicians interpreted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in flattery to him, than with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of Truth. He dream'd that he ſaw the <hi>Macedonian Phalanx</hi> all on fire, and <hi>Alexander</hi> waiting on him, clad in the ſame Robe which he uſed to wear when he was <hi>Aſgandes</hi> to the late King;<note place="margin">A Meſſenger.</note> after which going into the Temple of <hi>Belus,</hi> he vaniſh'd out of his ſight. By this dream it was manifeſt in my opinion, that the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> his Dream in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted.</note> Gods deſign'd to ſhew him the illuſtrious Actions the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were to perform, that as he from an <hi>Aſgandes</hi> had arriv'd at
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:33760:146"/>
the Crown, ſo <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould come to be Maſter of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and not long ſurviving his Conqueſts, conclude his Life with great Glory and Reputation. <hi>Darius</hi> his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence increas'd the more, becauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> ſpent ſo much time in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to his Cowardice: But it was ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that detain'd him there, which ſome ſay<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> falls ſick.</note> he contracted by taking too much pains, others by Bathing in the River <hi>Cydnus,</hi> whoſe Waters were exceeding cold. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it hapned, none of his Phyſicians would venture to give him any Remedies, they thought his caſe ſo deſperate, and were ſo afraid of the cenſure and ill will of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi> if they ſhould fail in the Cure; till <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Acarnanian</hi> conſidering his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream danger, and confiding in his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, reſolved to try the utmoſt efforts of his Art, and rather hazard his own Credit and Life, than ſuffer him to periſh for want of Phyſick, which he confidently admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to him, encouraging him to take it boldly, if he deſired a ſpeedy Recovery, in order to proſecute the War. At this very time <hi>Parmenio</hi> wrote to <hi>Alexander</hi> from the Camp, bidding him have a care of <hi>Philip,</hi> as one who was brib'd by <hi>Darius</hi> to kill him, with great ſums of Money, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his Daughter in Marriage. When he had perus'd the Letter, he put it under
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:33760:147"/>
his Pillow, without ſhewing it ſo much as to any of his moſt intimate Friends, and when <hi>Philip</hi> came in with the Potion, he took it with great chearfulneſs and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, withal giving him the Letter to read. This was an encounter well worth being preſent at, to ſee <hi>Alexander</hi> take the draught,<note place="margin">His confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Phyſician <hi>Philip.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Philip</hi> read the Letter at the ſame time, looking earneſtly upon one another, but with different Sentiments; for <hi>Alexander</hi>'s looks were chearful and open, a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his kindneſs to, and confidence in his Phyſician, while the others were full of ſurpriſe at the accuſation, appealing to the Gods to witneſs his Innocence, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lifting up his hands to Heaven, and then throwing himſelf down by the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and beſeeching <hi>Alexander</hi> to lay aſide all fear, and rely on his Fidelity. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine at firſt wrought ſo ſtrongly with him, that it overcame his Spirits, and brought him ſo low that he loſt his ſpeech, and falling into a Swoon, had ſcarce any ſenſe or pulſe left; but ſoon after, by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>'s<note place="margin">By whom he is Cur'd.</note> means, his Health and Strength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and he ſhewed himſelf in publick to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> who were in continual fear and dejection till they ſaw him abroad again.</p>
            <p>There was at this time in <hi>Darius</hi> his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my a <hi>Macedonian</hi> Fugitive, named <hi>Amyntas,</hi>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:33760:147"/>
one who was pretty well acquainted with <hi>Alexander</hi>'s deſigns, This Man, when he<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects good Counſel.</note> ſaw <hi>Darius,</hi> intended to fall upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the <hi>Straits</hi> of an incloſed Country, adviſed him rather to keep where he was, it being the advantage of a numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to have Field room enough, when it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages with a leſſer Force. <hi>Darius</hi> inſtead of taking his Counſel, told him, he was afraid the Enemy would endeavour to run away, and ſo <hi>Alexander</hi> would eſcape out of his hands. <hi>That Fear,</hi> replied <hi>Amyntas, is needleſs, for aſſure your ſelf that far from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding you, he will make all the ſpeed he can to meet you, and is now queſtionleſs on his March towards you.</hi> But <hi>Amyntas</hi> his Counſel was to no purpoſe, for <hi>Darius</hi> immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, marched into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> at the ſame time that <hi>Alexander</hi> advanced into <hi>Syria</hi> to meet him, but miſſing one another in the Night, they both came back again. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> mightily pleaſed with the Accident, made all the haſte he could to fight in the <hi>Straits,</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> to recover his former ground, and draw his Army out of ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous a place. For now he began to perceive his error in engaging too far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Country, which, by reaſon of the Sea, the Mountains, and the River <hi>Pindarus</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the midſt of it, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate him to divide his Forces, render
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:33760:148"/>
his Horſe almoſt unſerviceable, and only cover and ſupply the weakneſs of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Fortune was not kinder to <hi>Alexander</hi> in the ſituation of the place, than he was carefull to improve it to his advantage: For being much inferiour in numbers, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being incloſed, he ſtretched his Right<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Iſſus.</hi>
               </note> Wing much further out than his Left, and Fighting there himſelf in the very foremoſt Ranks, put the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to flight. In this Battel he was wounded in the Thigh by <hi>Darius</hi> (as <hi>Chares</hi> ſays) with whom he fought hand to hand. But in the account which he gave <hi>Antipater</hi> of the Battel, though indeed he owns he was run through the Thigh with a Sword, though not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, yet he takes no notice who it was that wounded him.</p>
            <p>Nothing was wanting to complete this glorious Victory, which he gain'd at the expence of above an Hundred and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of his Enemies lives, but the taking the Perſon of <hi>Darius,</hi> who eſcaped very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Darius</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcapes.</note> by flight. However, having taken his Chariot, and his Bow, he returned from purſuing him, and found his own Men buſie in pillaging the <hi>Barbarians</hi> Camp, which, though to disburden themſelves, they had left moſt of their Baggage at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> was exceeding rich. But <hi>Darius</hi> his Tent, in which were abundance of Officers, a
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:33760:148"/>
great deal of noble Furniture, and vaſt quantities of Gold and Silver, they reſerved for <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, who after he had put off his Arms, as he was going to Bathe himſelf, <hi>Let us now,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>cleanſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh our ſelves after the toils of war, in</hi> Darius <hi>his own Bath. Not ſo,</hi> replied one of his followers, <hi>but in</hi> Alexander's <hi>rather, for the Goods of the Vanquiſh'd are, and always ought to be, reputed the Conquerors.</hi> Here, when he beheld the Bathing Veſſels, the Water Pots, Vials, and Oyntment Boxes all of Gold, curiouſly wrought, and ſmelt the fragrant odours with which the whole place was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely perfumed, and from thence paſſed into another Apartment, large and well pitched, where the Bed, the Table, and the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> taken with the <hi>Perſian</hi> Luxury and Riches.</note> Entertainment were perfectly magnificent, he turned to thoſe about him, and in a kind of tranſport told them, <hi>This is to be a King indeed.</hi> But as he was going to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, word was brought him that <hi>Darius</hi> his Mother, and Wife, and two unmarried Daughters, being taken among the reſt of the Priſoners, upon the ſight of his Chariot and Bow, were all in tears and ſorrow, imagining him to be dead. After a little pauſe, more touched with their affliction than with his own ſucceſs, he ſent <hi>Leonatus</hi> to them, to let them know <hi>Darius</hi> was not Dead, and that they need not apprehend
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:33760:149"/>
any ill uſage from <hi>Alexander,</hi> who made War upon him only for Dominion; and that they ſhould find themſelves as well provided for, as ever they were in <hi>Darius</hi> his moſt flouriſhing condition, when his Empire was entire. This kind meſſage could not but be very welcom to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ladies, eſpecially being made good by Actions no leſs humane and generous: For he gave them leave to bury whom they pleaſed of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and to make uſe of what Garments and Furniture they thought<note place="margin">His gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous uſage of <hi>Darius</hi> his Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> fit out of the Booty. He diminiſhed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their Equipage, or of the reſpect formerly paid them, and allowed larger Penſions for their maintenance, than ever they had before. But the braveſt and moſt Royal Part of their uſage, was, that he treated theſe Illuſtrious Priſoners according to their Vertue and their Quality, not ſuffering them to hear, or receive, or ſo much as to apprehend any thing that was indecent, or to the prejudice of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. So that they ſeemed rather lodg'd in ſome Temple, or holy Virgin Cloyſter, where they enjoyed their Privicy ſacred and uninterrupted; than in the Camp of an Enemy. Not that he wanted temptation, for <hi>Darius</hi> his Wife was accounted the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulleſt Princeſs then living, as her Husband the handſomeſt and propereſt man of his
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:33760:149"/>
time, and the Daughters were no leſs charming than their Parents: But <hi>Alexander</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.</note> eſteeming it more glorious to govern himſelf than to conquer his Enemies, touch'd none of them, nor any other Woman before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, except <hi>Barſina, Memnon</hi>'s Widow, who was taken Priſoner at <hi>Damaſcus.</hi> She was very knowing in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Learning, of a ſweet temper, and by her Father <hi>Artaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus,</hi> Royally deſcended. Which good qualities added to the ſollicitations, and incouragement of <hi>Parmenio</hi> (as <hi>Ariſtobulus</hi> tells us) made him the more willing to enjoy ſo agreable and illuſtrious a Woman. Of the reſt of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Captives, tho' handſom and well proportion'd enough, he took no farther notice than to ſay mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that they were great eye-ſores. His Temperance and Chaſtity ſo much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the effects of their Charms, that they mov'd him no more than ſo many liveleſs Statues. And when <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> his Lieutenant on the Sea coaſt, wrote to him to know if he would buy two very fine Boys, which one <hi>Theodorus</hi> a <hi>Tarentine</hi> had to ſell: He was ſo offended, that he often<note place="margin">He is angry with thoſe who would have Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him.</note> expoſtulated with his Friends, what baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>Philoxenus</hi> had ever obſerv'd in him, that he ſhould preſume to make him ſuch a reproachful offer? And immediately wrote him a very ſharp Letter, commanding him
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:33760:150"/>
to diſmiſs <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and his vile Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize with diſgrace. Nor was he leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to <hi>Agnon,</hi> who ſent him word, he would buy a pretty <hi>Corinthian</hi> Youth nam'd <hi>Crobylus,</hi> to preſent him with. And hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> two of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio</hi>'s Soldiers, had abus'd the Wives of ſome Strangers who were in his Pay, he wrote to <hi>Parmenio,</hi> charging him ſtrictly, if he found them guilty, to put them to Death, as Beaſts that were good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to corrupt and ruine Mankind. In the ſame Letter he added, that he had not ſo much as ſeen, or deſir'd to ſee the Wife of <hi>Darius,</hi> no, nor ſuffer'd any body to ſpeak of her Beauty before him. He was wont to ſay, that Sleep, and the Act of Generation chiefly made him ſenſible that he was Mortal, withal affirming, that Pain and Pleaſure proceeded both from the ſame Frailty and Imbecillity of humane Nature.</p>
            <p>In his Diet he was moſt temperate, as<note place="margin">His Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> appears, omitting many other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by what he ſaid to <hi>Ada,</hi> whom he adopted to be his Mother, and afterwards created Queen of <hi>Caria.</hi> For when ſhe out of Kindneſs ſent him every day many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Diſhes and Sweet-meats, and would have furniſh'd him with ſuch Cooks and Paſtry-men as were excellent in their kind: he told her, He wanted none of them, his
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:33760:150"/>
Praeceptor <hi>Leonidas</hi> having already given him the beſt, which were Night-marches to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him for his Dinner, and moderate Dinners to create an Appetite for Supper. And that he us'd to open and ſearch the Furniture of his Chamber, and his Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, to ſee if his Mother had left him any thing that was nice or ſuperfluous. He was much leſs addicted to Wine than was generally believ'd; that which gave People occaſion to think ſo of him, was, that when he had nothing elſe to do, he lov'd to ſit long and diſcourſe, rather than drink, and tell long Stories between every Glaſs. For when his Affairs call'd upon him, he would not be detain'd as other Generals often were, either by Wine, or Sleep, Nuptial Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, Spectacles, or any other Diverſion whatſoever: A convincing Argument of which is, that in the ſhort time he liv'd, he accompliſh'd ſo many and ſo great Actions. When he was free from Employment, after he was up, and had Sacrifi'd to the Gods, he us'd to ſit down to Dinner, and then ſpend the reſt of the day either in Hunting,<note place="margin">And man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Life deſcrib'd.</note> or writing Memoirs, or compoſing Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among his Soldiers, or Reading. In Marches that requir'd no great haſte, he would practiſe Shooting as he went along, or to mount a Chariot, and alight from it in full ſpeed. Sometimes for Sports ſake,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:33760:151"/>
his Journals tell us, he would go a Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hunting, and Fowling, and when he came home, after he had Bath'd, and was anointed, he would call for his Bakers, and chief Cooks, to know if they had got his Supper ready in good order. He never car'd to Sup till it was pretty late, and was wonderful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect at Meals, that every one who ſate with him ſhould be ſerv'd alike. His talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative Humour, as I noted before, made him delight to ſit long at Table, and then, though otherwiſe no Princes Converſation was ever ſo agreeable, he would fall into ſuch a vein of Oſtentation, and Soldierly Bragging, as<note place="margin">He is given to bragging.</note> gave his Flatterers a great advantage to ride him, and made his beſt Friends and Servants very uneaſie. For though they thought it too baſe to ſtrive who ſhould Flatter him moſt, yet they found it hazardous not to<note place="margin">And ſubject to Flattery.</note> do it; ſo that between the Shame and the Danger, they were in a great ſtrait how to behave themſelves. After ſuch an Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, he was wont to Bath, and then perhaps he would Sleep till Noon, and ſometimes all day long. He was ſo very Temperate in his Diet, that when any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Fiſh or Fruits were ſent him, he would diſtribute them among his Friends, and hardly reſerve any for his own Eating. His Table however was always Magnificent, the Expence of it ſtill increaſing with his
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:33760:151"/>
good Fortune, till it amounted to 10000<note place="margin">The Expence of his Table.</note> Drachmas a day, to which Sum he limited it; and beyond this, he would ſuffer none to lay out in an Entertainment, though he himſelf were the Gueſt.</p>
            <p>After the Battel of <hi>Iſſus,</hi> he ſent to <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> to ſeize upon the Money and Baggage, the Wives and Children of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> of which the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> Horſemen had the greateſt ſhare; for he had taken particular notice of their Gallantry in the Fight, and ſent them thither on purpoſe to make their Reward ſuitable to their Courage: Not but that the reſt of the Army had ſo conſiderable part of the Booty, as was ſufficient to make the Fortune of every private Soldier. This firſt gave the <hi>Macedonians</hi> ſuch a taſte of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Wealth, Women, and manner of Living, that they purſued and trac'd it with the ſame eagerneſs and ardour, that Hounds do when they are upon a Scent. <hi>Alexander</hi> before he proceeded any farther, thought<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia</hi> yielded to him.</note> it neceſſary to aſſure himſelf of the Sea-Coaſt. Thoſe who Govern'd in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> put that Iſland into his Poſſeſſion, and all <hi>Phoenicia</hi> except <hi>Tyre</hi> was Surrendred to him without a ſtroke. During the Siege of this City, which with Mounts of Earth caſt up, and<note place="margin">He Beſieges <hi>Tyre.</hi>
               </note> battering Engines, and 200 Gallies by Sea, was carried on with all imaginable vigour for ſeven Months together, he chanc'd to
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:33760:152"/>
Dream, that he ſaw <hi>Hercules</hi> upon the Walls, reaching out his Hand, and calling to him. And many of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> in their Sleep, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied that <hi>Apollo</hi> told them, he was diſpleas'd with their Actions, and was about to leave them, and go over to <hi>Alexander.</hi> Upon which, as if the God were a Fugitive, they took him in the Fact, chaining his Statue, and nailing it to the Pedeſtal, withal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him, that he was an <hi>Alexandriſt,</hi> or a Favourer of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Party. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time <hi>Alexander</hi> Dream'd, He ſaw a Satyr mocking him at a diſtance, and when he endeavour'd to catch him, he ſtill eſcap'd from him, till at laſt, with much perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and running about after him, he got him into his Power. The Soothſayers making two words of <hi>Satyros,</hi> aſſur'd him,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>While the Body of the Army lay before <hi>Tyre,</hi> he made a ſhort Excurſion againſt the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who inhabit Mount <hi>Antilibanus,</hi> in which he hazarded his Life extreamly, to bring off his Maſter <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> who would needs go along with him, bragging he was neither older, nor inferior in Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to <hi>Phoenix Achilles,</hi> his Tutor, whoſe Name he affected to bear. For when quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:33760:152"/>
their Horſes, they march'd up the Hill on foot, the reſt of the Soldiers out-went them a great deal, ſo that Night drawing on, and the Enemy near, <hi>Alexander</hi> was<note place="margin">His care of his old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> fain to ſtay behind ſo long, to encourage and help up the lagging, tir'd old Man, that before he was aware, he was gotten a great way from his Army with a ſlender atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and forc'd to paſs an extream cold Night in the dark, and in a very ill place. Till ſeeing a great many ſcattered Fires of the Enemy at ſome diſtance, and truſting to his Agility of Body, and conſtant Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigableneſs, with which he was wont to relieve and ſupport the <hi>Macedonians</hi> in their Diſtreſs, he ran ſtrait to one of the neareſt<note place="margin">and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Valour, in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of danger</note> Fires, and with his Dagger diſpatching two of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> that ſate by it, ſnatch'd up a lighted Brand, and return'd with it to his own Men, who immediately made a great Fire, which ſo terrified the Enemy, that moſt of them fled, and thoſe that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted them were ſoon routed, by which means they lodg'd ſecurely the reſt of the Night. Thus <hi>Chares</hi> gives an account of this Action.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Siege, it had this Iſſue: <hi>Alexander</hi> that he might refreſh his Army, haraſs'd with many former Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, drew out a ſmall Party, rather to keep the Enemy upon Duty, than with any
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:33760:153"/>
proſpect of much Advantage. It happen'd at this time, that <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> after he had ſacrific'd, upon view of the Intrails, affirm'd confidently to thoſe who ſtood by, that the City ſhould be certainly taken that very Month, which made them laugh at, and mock him exceedingly, becauſe that was the laſt day of it. But the King taking notice of his Perplexity, and emulous Zeal, ever ambitious to have his Predictions take place, commanded they ſhould not account that the <hi>30th,</hi> but the <hi>3d</hi> day of the expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Month, and ordering the Trumpets to ſound, attack'd the Walls with more Fury<note place="margin">He takes <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Gaza.</hi>
               </note> than he at firſt intended. The briskneſs of the Aſſault ſo inflam'd the reſt of his Forces who were left in the Camp, that they could not hold from advancing to ſecond it, which they perform'd with ſo much Vigour, that the <hi>Tyrians</hi> retir'd, and the Town was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried that very day. The next Place he ſate down before was <hi>Gaza,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Syria,</hi> where this Accident befel him, A great Fowl flying over him, let a Clod of Earth fall upon his Soulder, and then ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling upon one of the battering Engines, was ſuddenly intangled and caught in the<note place="margin">Where he is wounded by a ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:33760:153"/>

            <p>From hence he ſent great part of the Spoils to <hi>Olympias, Cleopatra,</hi> and the reſt of his Friends, not omitting his <hi>Praeceptor Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas,</hi> on whom he beſtowed five hundred Talents worth of Frankincenſe, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Myrrh; prompted to it by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his forward hopes of him, when he was but a Child. For <hi>Leonidas,</hi> it ſeems, ſtanding by him one day while he was ſacrificing, and ſeeing him take both his hands full of Gums to throw into the Fire, told him, it became him to be more ſparing in his Offerings then, and not be ſo profuſe till he was Maſter of the Countries, where thoſe ſweet Gums and Spices were produc'd. Upon this account, <hi>Alexander</hi> wrote him word, he had ſent him a large quantity of Myrrh and Frankincenſe, that for the future he might not be ſo niggardly to the Gods. Among the Treaſures and other Booty that was taken from <hi>Darius,</hi> there was a very curious little Box, which being preſented to <hi>Alexander</hi> for a great Rarity, he ask'd thoſe about him what they thought fitteſt to be laid up in it; and when they had delivered their opinions, he told them he eſteem'd nothing ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be preſerv'd in it as <hi>Homer's Iliads.</hi>

Authors, and if what thoſe of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> relying upon the credit of <hi>Heraclides,</hi> tell us be true; <hi>Homer</hi> was neither an idle, nor an unprofitable Companion to him in his expedition. For when he was Maſter of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> deſigning to ſettle a Colony of <hi>Grecians</hi> there, he reſolv'd to build a large and populous City, and give it his own Name. In order to which, after he had meaſur'd and ſtak'd out the Ground, with with the advice of the beſt Workmen, he chanc'd one Night in his ſleep to ſee a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Viſion: A gray-headed Old Man, of a venerable Aſpect, appear'd to ſtand by him, and pronounce theſe Verſes,</p>
            <lg>

his Men, till 50000 were ſwallowed up and deſtroyed by it. All theſe difficulties were weighed and repreſented to him; but <hi>Alexander</hi> was not eaſily to be diverted from any thing he was bent upon: For Fortune having hitherto ſeconded him in his deſigns, made him reſolute and firm in his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the greatneſs of his Mind raiſed a confidence in him of ſurmounting almoſt invincible difficulties; as if it were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be always victorious in the Field, unleſs Places, and Seaſons, and Nature her ſelf ſubmitted to him.

But the greateſt Miracle, as <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> tells
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:33760:155"/>
us, was, That if any of the Company went aſtray in the Night, they never left croking and making a noiſe, till by that means they had brought them into the right way again. Having paſſed through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs they came to the City, where the High-Prieſt, at the firſt ſalute bade <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> welcom from his Father <hi>Ammon:</hi> And being ask'd by him whether any of his Father's Murderers had eſcaped puniſhment, he charg'd him to ſpeak with more reſpect, for his Father was not Mortal. Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> more plainly deſired to know of him, if any of thoſe who murder'd <hi>Philip</hi> were yet unpuniſh'd, and further concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dominion, whether the Empire of the World was reſerv'd for him? This the God anſwered he ſhould obtain, and that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>'s Death was fully reveng'd; which gave him ſo much ſatisfaction, that he made ſplendid Offerings to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and gave the Prieſts very rich Preſents. This is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what Anſwers he receiv'd from the Oracle: Although <hi>Alexander</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Mother tells her, there were ſome ſecret Predictions, which, at his return, he would communicate to her only.

To this was fitted a Gorget of the ſame metal, ſet with precious ſtones. His Sword, which was the weapon he moſt us'd in Fight, was given him by the King of the <hi>Citieans,</hi> and was of an admirable temper and lightneſs. But the Belt which he wore alſo in all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, was of much richer Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip than the reſt of his Armour; it was made by old <hi>Helicon,</hi> and preſented him by the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> as a mark of their Reſpect to him. When-ever he drew up his Men, or rode about to give Orders, or inſtruct, or view them, he favour'd <hi>Bucephalus</hi> by reaſon of his Age, and made uſe of another Horſe; but when he was to fight, he ſent for him again, and as ſoon as he was mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, preſently fell upon the Enemy. After he had made a long Oration to the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> who encourag'd him with loud Outcries, deſiring to be led on to the Charge, he ſhifted his Javeling into his left Hand, and with his right lifted up towards Heaven, beſought the Gods,

that if he was of a truth the Son of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> they would be pleas'd to aſſiſt and ſtrengthen the <hi>Graecians.</hi> At the ſame time the Augur <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> who had a white Mantle about him, and a Crown of Gold<note place="margin">A good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men before the Battel.</note> on his Head, rode by, and ſhew'd them an Eagle that ſoar'd juſt over <hi>Alexander,</hi> and directed his flight towards the Enemy; which ſo animated the Beholders, that after mutual Encouragements and Exhortations, the Horſe charg'd at full ſpeed, and were vigourouſly ſeconded by the Foot. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could well come to Blows with the firſt Ranks, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſhrunk back, and were hotly purſued by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who drave thoſe that fled before him into the middle of the Battel, where <hi>Darius</hi> himſelf was in Perſon, whom he ſaw over the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Ranks, conſpicuous in the midſt of his Life-Guard; for he was an handſom, proper Man, and drawn in a lofty Chariot, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by abundance of the beſt Horſe, who ſtood cloſe in order about it, ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Enemy. But <hi>Alexander</hi>'s approach was ſo terrible, forcing thoſe who gave back, upon thoſe who yet maintain'd their Ground, that he beat down and diſpers'd them almoſt all, but a few of the braveſt and valianteſt, who were ſlain in their King's preſence, falling in heaps upon one another, and in the very pangs of Death ſtriving by

Now alſo he more and more accomodated himſelf in his way of Living to that of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and brought them as near as he could to the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Cuſtoms; wiſely conſidering, that ſince he deſign'd an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which would carry him far from thence, it was better to ſettle affairs in his<note place="margin">His Methods to preſerve his new Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>queſts.</note> abſence, by a mixture of their Conſtitutions, and mutual Society with Good will, than by Compulſion. In order to this he choſe out 30000 Boys, whom he allow'd Maſters to teach them the Greek Tongue, and to train them up to Arms in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. As for his Marriage of <hi>Roxana,</hi> whoſe good Mein and Beauty had charm'd him, at a Drinking entertainment, where he firſt happen'd to ſee her, it was perfectly
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:33760:175"/>
the effect of Love, nor did it appear to be at all prejudicial to his Intereſt, as things ſtood with him at that time: For it put the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd People in heart, and made them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in him, and love him more than ever, when they ſaw how continent he was, and that he forbore the only Woman he was ever in Love with, till he could enjoy her in a lawful and honourable way.</p>
            <p>When he perceiv'd that among his chief<note place="margin">The politick uſe he made of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites.</note> Friends and Favourites, <hi>Hepheſtion</hi> moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd all that he did, and comply'd with, and imitated him in his Habit, while <hi>Craterus</hi> continued ſtrict in the obſervation of the Cuſtoms and Faſhions of his own Countrey: He made the beſt uſe of them both, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt in all Tranſactions with the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> and the latter when he had to do with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Macedonians.</hi> It is true, he lov'd <hi>Hepheſtion</hi> beſt as a Favorite, becauſe he lov'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> but then he eſteem'd and honour'd <hi>Craterus</hi> moſt as a Friend, becauſe he lov'd the King. Wherefore theſe two great Men bore one another ſecret Grudges, and often claſh'd and quarrell'd ſo far, that once in <hi>India</hi> they drew upon one another, and were going to it in good earneſt, with their Friends on each ſide to ſecond them, till <hi>Alexander</hi> came up to them, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprov'd <hi>Hepheſtion,</hi> calling him Fool and Mad-man, not to be ſenſible that without

He chid <hi>Craterus</hi> alſo in private very ſeverely, and then cauſing them both to come into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he reconcil'd them, at the ſame time ſwearing by <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> and the reſt of the Gods, that he lov'd them two above all other Men; but if ever he perceivd them fall out again, he would be ſure to put both of them to death, at leaſt the Aggreſſor: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, they neither ever did, or ſaid any thing, ſo much as in jeſt to offend one another.</p>

by ſtrong Evidence, yet he would take no notice of it at preſent, whether it was, that he confided in <hi>Parmenio</hi>'s Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Loyalty, or that he apprehended their Authority and Intereſt in the Army. About this time one <hi>Dimnus,</hi> a <hi>Macedonian</hi>

<pb n="331" facs="tcp:33760:182"/>
engag'd in Diſcourſe with <hi>Hepheſtion,</hi> did not mind him, and then offer'd to kiſs him.

And to finiſh his Diſgrace, <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> and <hi>Agnon</hi> added, That this Sophiſter went about priding himſelf, as if he ſtood in the Gap againſt Arbitrary Power; that the young Men all ran after him, and honour'd him, as the only Man among ſo many Thouſands, who had the Courage to preſerve his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Therefore when <hi>Hermolaus</hi> his Conſpiracy came to be diſcover'd, the Crimes which his Enemies laid to his charge were the more eaſily believ'd, particularly that when the young Man ask'd him, <hi>What he ſhould do to be the moſt illuſtrious Perſon on Earth;</hi> he told him, <hi>The readieſt way was to kill him who was already ſo.</hi> And that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite him to commit the Fact, he bid him not be aw'd by his Golden Bed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

               <hi>Alexander</hi> was a Man equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and vulnerable as another. However, none of <hi>Hermolaus</hi> his Accomplices, in the extremity of their Torments, made any mention of <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> his being engag'd in the Deſign. Nay <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf, in the Letters which he wrote ſoon after to <hi>Crate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Attalus,</hi> and <hi>Alcetas,</hi> tells them, That thoſe who were put to the Rack, confeſs'd they had enter'd into the Conſpiracy whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of themſelves, without any others being privy to, or guilty of it. But yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in a Letter to <hi>Antipater,</hi> he accuſes <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> of the ſame Crime. <hi>The young Men,</hi> ſays he, <hi>were ſton'd to Death by the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians, <hi>but for the Sophiſter,</hi> meaning Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſthenes, <hi>I will take care to puniſh him, with them too who ſent him to me, and who harbour thoſe in their Cities who conſpire againſt my Life.</hi> By which Expreſſions it appears, he had no<note place="margin">

His Death is diverſly related: ſome ſay, he was hang'd by <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; others, that he died of Sickneſs in Priſon; but <hi>Chares</hi> writes, he was kept in Chains ſeven Months after he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, on purpoſe that he might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt in full Council, when <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſhould be preſent; and that being

An Action which in the delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it ſeem'd more dangerous and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult than it prov'd in the Execution, with which few were diſſatisfied; for moſt of

Nor did he judge amiſs; for being charg'd by 1000 Horſe, and 60 arm'd Chariots, which advanc'd before their main Body, he took all the Chariots, and kill'd 400 Horſe upon the Place. <hi>Porus</hi> by this ſmart Execution, gueſſing that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> himſelf was gotten over, came on with his whoie Army, except a Party which he left behind, to hold the reſt of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in Play, if they ſhould attempt to paſs the River. But <hi>Alexander</hi> apprehending the multitude of the Enemie, and to avoid the ſhock of their Elephants, would not joyn Battel with them in Front, but dividing his Forces, attack'd their left Wing himſelf, and commanded <hi>Coenus</hi> to fall uppon the right, which was perform'd with good Succeſs. For by this means both Wings being broken, they retir'd when they found themſelves<note place="margin">

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:33760:188"/>
they were entirely defeated. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Battel the Conqueror has left us in his own Epiſtles.</p>
            <p>Almoſt all Writers agree, That <hi>Porus</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Porus</hi> his Stature.</note> was four Cubits and an half high, and that when he was upon his Elephant, which was of the largeſt ſize, his Stature and Bulk were ſo anſwerable, that he appear'd to be but proportionably mounted. This Elephant, during the whole Battel, gave many proofs of wonderful Underſtanding, and a particular Care of the King, whom as long as he was ſtrong, and in condition to Fight, he defended with great Courage, repelling thoſe who ſet upon him; and as ſoon as he perceiv'd him ready to faint, by<note place="margin">His Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</note> reaſon of his many Wounds, and multitude of Darts that were thrown at him, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his falling off, he ſoftly kneel'd down, &amp; then with his Proboſois gently drew every Dart out of his Body. When <hi>Porus</hi> was taken Priſoner, and <hi>Alexander</hi> ask'd him, <hi>How he expected to be us'd?</hi> he anſwer'd, <hi>As a King ought to be; for that expreſſion,</hi> he ſaid, when the ſame Queſtion was put to him a ſecond time, <hi>comprehended every thing.</hi> And <hi>Alexander</hi> indeed dealt very generouſly with him, for he not only ſuffer'd him to govern his own Kingdom as his Lieutenant, but added to it a large Province of ſome free People whom he had newly ſubdued, which
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:33760:189"/>
conſiſted of 15 ſeveral Nations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd 5000 conſiderable Towns, beſides abundance of Villages. Another Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, three times as large as this, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd on <hi>Philip,</hi> one of his Friends.</p>
            <p>Some time after the Battel with <hi>Porus,</hi> moſt Authors agree, that <hi>Bucephalus</hi> died under cure of his Wounds, or as <hi>Oneſicritus</hi> ſays, of Fatigue and Age, being 30 years old. <hi>Alexander</hi> was no leſs concern'd at his Death, than if he had loſt an old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, or an intimate Friend, and built a City, which he nam'd <hi>Bucephalia,</hi> in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory<note place="margin">A City built in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalus.</hi>

            <p>But this laſt Combat with <hi>Porus</hi> took off the edge of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> Courage, and hindred their farther progreſs in <hi>India.</hi> For having with much ado defeated him, who brought but 20000 Foot, and 2000 Horſe into the Field, they thought they had Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to oppoſe <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Deſign of obliging<note place="margin">The <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to paſs the <hi>Ganges.</hi>

expected them there with 80000 Horſe, 200000 Foot, 8000 arm'd Chariots, and 6000 fighting Elephants. Nor was this a falſe, vain Report, ſpread on purpoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them; for <hi>Androcottus,</hi> who not long after reign'd in thoſe Parts, made a Preſent of 500 Elephants at once to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and with an Army of 600000 Men ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all <hi>India.

               </note> griev'd and enrag'd at his Mens Reluctancy, that he ſhut himſelf up in his Tent, and in a deſponding manner threw himſelf upon the Ground, declaring, if they would not paſs the <hi>Ganges,</hi> he ow'd them no thanks for any thing they had hitherto done, and that to retreat now, was plainly to confeſs himſelf vanquiſh'd. But at laſt, the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Remonſtrances and Perſwaſions of his Friends, who inform'd him truly how the Caſe ſtood, and the Tears and Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Soldiers, who in a ſuppliant manner crowded about the entrance of his Tent, prevail'd with him to think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning. Yet before he decamp'd, he would needs impoſe upon Poſterity, by leaving<note place="margin">What care he takes to deceive Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</note> behind ſome fictitious Monuments of his Glory; ſuch as Arms of an extraordinary bigneſs, and Mangers for Horſes, with Bits of Bridles above the uſual ſize, which he ſet up, and diſtributed in ſeveral Places. He erected Altars alſo to the Gods, which
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:33760:190"/>
the Kings of the <hi>Perſians</hi> even in our Time highly reverence, and often paſs the River to ſacrifice upon them after the <hi>Graecian</hi> manner. <hi>Androcottus,</hi> then a Youth, ſaw <hi>Alexander</hi> there, and has often afterwards been heard to ſay, That he miſs'd but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of making himſelf Maſter of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; their King, who then reign'd, was ſo hated and deſpis'd for the viciouſneſs of his Life, and the meanneſs of his Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> decamping from hence, had a<note place="margin">His Voyage down the Rivers.</note> mind to ſee the Ocean; to which purpoſe he caus'd a great many Veſſels with Oars, and ſmall Boats to be built, in which he fell gently down the Rivers, making Merry as he went, and order'd it ſo, that his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation was neither unprofitable nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active; for by making ſeveral Deſcents, he took in the Fortifi'd Towns, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Country on both ſides. But<note place="margin">His Danger among the <hi>Mallians.</hi>
               </note> at the Siege of a City of the <hi>Mallians,</hi> who are the valianteſt People of <hi>India,</hi> he ran great danger of his Life; for having beaten off the Defendants with ſhowers of Arrows, he was the firſt Man that mounted the Wall by a ſcaling Ladder, which, as ſoon as he was up, broke, and left him almoſt alone expoſed to the Darts, which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> threw at him in great numbers from below. In this Diſtreſs, turning himſelf as well as
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:33760:190"/>
he could, he leaped down in the midſt of his Enemies, and had the good Fortune to light upon his Feet. The brightneſs and clattering of his Armour, when he came to the Ground, made the <hi>Barbarians</hi> think, they ſaw Rays of Light, or ſome Phantom playing before his Body, which frighted them ſo at firſt, that they ran away and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd themſelves, till ſeeing him ſeconded but by two of his Guards, they fell upon him Hand to Hand, and though he defended himſelf very bravely, wounded him through his Armour with their Swords and Spears. One who ſtood farther off, drew a Bow with ſuch juſt Strength, that the Arrow finding its way through his Cuiraſs, ſtuck in his Ribs under the Breaſt. This ſtroke was ſo violent, that it made him give back, and ſet one Knee to the Ground, which as ſoon as he that Shot him perceiv'd, he came up to him with his drawn Scimitar, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſpatch him, and had done it, if <hi>Peuceſtes</hi> and <hi>Limnaeus</hi> had not interpos'd, who were both wounded, <hi>Limnaeus</hi> mortally, but <hi>Peuceſtes</hi> ſtood his Ground, while <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> kill'd the <hi>Barbarian.</hi> But this did not free him from danger; for beſides many other Wounds, at laſt he receiv'd ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">He is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wounded.</note> a ſtroke of a Club upon his Neck, that he was forc'd to lean his Body againſt the Wall, yet ſtill look'd undauntedly upon

the Enemy. When he was reduc'd to this Extremity, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> breaking in to his Aſſiſtance, very opportunely took him up, juſt as he was fainting away, having loſt all ſenſe of what was done near him, and convey'd him to his Tent, upon which it was preſently reported all over the Camp that he was dead. But when they had with great difficulty and pains ſaw'd out the Shaft of the Arrow which was of Wood, and ſo with much ado got off his Cuiraſs, they came to cut the Head of it, which was three fingers broad, and four long, and ſtuck faſt in the Bone. During the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, he was taken with almoſt mortal Swoonings, but when it was out, he came to himſelf again. Yet though all Danger was paſt, he continued very weak, and confin'd himſelf a great while to a regular Diet, and the method of his Cure, till one day hearing the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were ſo deſirous to ſee him, that they were ready to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he put on his Robe, and when he had ſhew'd himſelf to them, and ſacrific'd to the Gods, without more delay he went on Board again, and as he coaſted along, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued a great deal of the Country on both ſides, and took in ſeveral conſiderable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

a golden Cup, for them to uſe in their Liba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Wine to the Honour of the Gods.

coming to themſelves again, they went without their Arms, almoſt naked, crying and weeping to offer themſelves at his Tent, and deſired him to deal with them as their Baſeneſs and Ingratitude deſerv'd.

not denying the thing, he ask'd him in what condition he found the Victim? and when he told him, The Liver was defective in its Lobe; a great Preſage indeed, ſaid <hi>Alexander!</hi> However, he offered <hi>Pythagoras</hi> no Injury, but was much troubled that he had neglected <hi>Nearchus</hi> his Advice, and therefore ſtaid a great while without the Town, removing his Tent from Place to Place, and ſailing up and down the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharates.</hi> Beſides this, he was diſturbed by<note place="margin">Several Preſages of his Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> many other Prodigies. A tame Aſs fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the biggeſt and handſomeſt Lyon that he kept, and kicked him to Death. And one day undreſſing himſelf to be anointed, and to play at Ball, when he was putting his Cloaths on again, the young Men who played with him, perceived a Man clad in the King's Robes, with the Diadem upon his Head, ſitting ſilently upon his Throne. They asked him, Who he was? To which he gave no Anſwer a good while, till at laſt with much ado coming to himſelf, he told them, His Name was <hi>Dyoniſius;</hi> that he was of <hi>Meſſenia;</hi> that for ſome Crime, whereof he was accus'd, he was brought thither from the Sea-ſide, and had been kept long in Priſon; that <hi>Serapis</hi> appear'd to him, had freed him from his Chains, conducted him to that Place, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to put on the King's Robe
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:33760:199"/>
and Diadem, and to ſit where they found him, and to ſay nothing. <hi>Alexander</hi> when he heard this, by the direction of his Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers put the Fellow to Death, but from thenceforth deſponded, and grew diffident of the Protection and Aſſiſtance of the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> diſtruſts the Gods.</note> Gods, and beſides very ſuſpicious of his Friends. His greateſt apprehenſion was of <hi>Antipater</hi> and his Sons, one of whom, <hi>Iollas</hi> was his chief Cup-bearer, the other nam'd <hi>Caſſander,</hi> was newly arriv'd out of <hi>Greèce,</hi> and being bred up in the freedom of his Country, the firſt time he ſaw ſome of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> adore the King, could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear laughing at it aloud; which ſo incens'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he took him by the Hair with both Hands, and violently knock'd his Head againſt the Wall. Another time <hi>Caſſander</hi> would have ſaid ſomething in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Antipater,</hi> to thoſe who accus'd him; but <hi>Alexander</hi> interrupting him, <hi>What is't you ſay? Do you think People, if they had receiv'd no Injury, would come ſuch a Journey only to calumniate your Father?</hi> To which when <hi>Caſſander</hi> replied, That this very thing<note place="margin">His Uſage of <hi>Caſſander</hi>
               </note> was a great evidence of their Calumny; <hi>Alexander</hi> ſmil'd and ſaid, Thoſe were ſome of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Sophiſms, which would ſerve equally on both ſides; and added, That both he and his Father ſhould be ſeverely puniſh'd, if they were found guilty of the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:33760:199"/>
leaſt Injuſtice towards thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd; which, upon the whole, made ſuch a deep impreſſion of Fear in <hi>Caſſander</hi>'s Mind, that long after when he was King of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> and Maſter of <hi>Greece,</hi> as he was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down at <hi>Delphos,</hi> and looking on the Statues, at the ſight of that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> he was ſuddenly ſtruck with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and ſhook all over, his Eyes rowl'd,<note place="margin">A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Effect of Fear.</note> his Head grew dizzy, and he had much ado to recover himſelf.</p>
            <p>When once <hi>Alexander</hi> gave way to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, his Mind grew ſo diſturb'd and timorous, that if the leaſt unuſual or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing happen'd, he would needs have it thought a Prodigy, or a Preſage, and his Court was throng'd with Diviners and Prieſts, whoſe buſineſs was to Sacrifice, and Purifie, and foretel the future. So hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid a thing is Incredulity, and Contempt of the Gods on one hand, and no leſs horrid<note place="margin">The nature of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> is Superſtition on the other, which like Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, always creeping on the Ground, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades us with ſervile Fear and Folly, as it did now <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf. But upon ſome Anſwers which were brought him from the Oracle concerning <hi>Hepheſtion,</hi> he had laid aſide his Sorrow, and fell again to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing and Drinking; and having given <hi>Nearchus</hi> a ſplendid Entertainment, after he had bath'd, as was his Cuſtom, juſt as he
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:33760:200"/>
was going to Bed, at <hi>Medius</hi> his Requeſt he went to Supper with him. Here he drank all that night and the next day to ſuch exceſs, as put him into a Fever, which<note place="margin">

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:33760:200"/>
day he had a ſevere Fit, and caus'd himſelf to be remov'd, and his Bed ſet by the great Bath, and then diſcours'd with his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers about filling up the vacant Charges in the Army, with Men of tryed Valour aud Experience. The <hi>24th</hi> being much worſe, he was carried out to aſſiſt at the Sacrifices, and gave order that his chief Commanders ſhould wait within the Court, whilſt the Colonels and Captains kept Watch without doors. The <hi>25th</hi> he was remov'd to his Palace on the other ſide the River, where he ſlept a little, but his Fever abated not, and when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders came into his Chamber, he was ſpeechleſs, and continued ſo the following day.

The ſame day <hi>Python</hi> and <hi>Seleucus</hi> being ſent to <hi>Serapis</hi> his Temple, to enquire if they ſhould bring <hi>Alexander</hi> thither, were anſwer'd by the God, that they ſhould not remove him.

            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:33760:201"/>At that time no body had any ſuſpicion of his being poyſon'd; but upon a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made ſix years after, they ſay, <hi>Olympias</hi> put many to death, and threw abroad the<note place="margin">Not without ſuſpicion of Poyſon.</note> Aſhes of <hi>Jollas,</hi> who was dead, as if he had given it him.

               <hi>Engliſhed from the</hi> Greek <hi>by Mr.</hi> Smalridge <hi>of</hi> Chriſtchurch.</byline>
            <p>AS ſoon as <hi>Sylla</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Rome,</hi> he reſolved to force <hi>Cornelia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Cinna</hi> (the late Uſurper) from <hi>Caeſar</hi> her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; but being unable to compaſs it either by hopes or fears, confiſcated her Dowry. The ground of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s hatred to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was the alliance between him and <hi>Marius;</hi> for <hi>Marius</hi> the elder Married <hi>Julia, Caeſar</hi>'s Aunt by the Fathers ſide, and had by her the younger <hi>Marius,</hi> who conſequently was
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:33760:203"/>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Couſin-german. And thô at firſt in the heat of his Tyranny and hurry of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Caeſar</hi> was overlook't by <hi>Sylla,</hi> he could not lie ſtill, but preſented himſelf to the People as a Candidate for the Prieſthood, thô he was yet under Age. But <hi>Sylla,</hi> by his under-hand management, ſo carried it, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> fell ſhort of his pretenſions; and in a Conſult of Friends to take him off, when it was urged by ſome, that it was not worth his while to contrive the death of a Boy, he anſwered, that They knew little, who did not ſee many <hi>Marius</hi>'s in that Boy. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> upon notice of this lay concealed a long while among the <hi>Sabines,</hi> often chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Quarters; till one night, as he was removing his Lodging for his health, he fell into the hands of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Soldiers, who were ſearching thoſe parts in order to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſuch as had abſconded. <hi>Coeſar</hi> by a Bribe of two Talents prevailed with <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> their Captain to let him go, and was no ſooner diſmiſt, but he put to Sea, and made for <hi>Bithynia.</hi> After a ſhort ſtay there with <hi>Nicomedes</hi> the King, in his paſſage back he was taken near the Iſland <hi>Pharmacuſa</hi> by ſome Pirates, who at that time with ſome great Ships, and a vaſt number of ſmaller Veſſels, infeſted thoſe Seas. When at firſt they demanded of him 20 Talents for his Ranſom, he ſmiled at them as not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:33760:203"/>
the value of their Priſoner, and voluntarily engaged to give 'em 50. He preſently diſpatched thoſe about him to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places to raiſe the Money, till at laſt he was left among thoſe bloody Villains, the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> only with one Friend, and two Attendants; Yet he made ſo little of them, that when he had a mind to ſleep, he would ſend to them, and command ſilence. For 38 days, with all the freedom in the World he uſed Exerciſe, and Gamed amongſt them, as if they had not been his Keepers, but his Guards. He wrote Verſes, and Speeches, and made them his Auditors, and thoſe who did not admire them, he called to their faces illiterate and barbarous, and would often in raillery threaten to hang 'em. They were mightily taken with this, and attributed his free way of talking to a kind of Simplicity, and Juvenile Humor. As ſoon as his Ranſom was come from <hi>Miletus,</hi> he paid it, and was diſcharged; ſoon after which he Mann'd ſome Ships at the <hi>Mileſian</hi> Port, and went in purſuit of the Pirates, whom he ſurprized as they were yet at an Anchor, and took moſt of them. Their Money he made Prize, and the Men he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in Priſon at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and preſently applied himſelf to <hi>Junius,</hi> who was then Governor of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to whoſe Office it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, as <hi>Praetor,</hi> to determine their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:33760:204"/>
               <hi>Junius</hi> having his Eye upon the Money, (for the Sum was conſiderable) ſaid, <hi>He would think at his leiſure what to do with the Priſoners;</hi> upon which <hi>Caeſar</hi> took his leave of him, and went for <hi>Pergamus,</hi> where he ordered the Pirates to be brought forth and Crucified; the Puniſhment he had often threatened them with, whilſt he was in their hands, and they little dream't he was in earneſt. In the mean time <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Power declined, and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Friends adviſed him to return to <hi>Rome;</hi> but he went off to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and entred himſelf in the School of <hi>Apollonius, Molon</hi>'s Son, a famous Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, one who had the reputation of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered Man, and had <hi>Cicero</hi> at that time for his Auditor. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was by Nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently framed for a perfect States-Man, and Orator, and took ſuch pains to improve his Genius this way, that without diſpute he might challenge the ſecond place amongſt Men of that Character. More he did not aim at, as chuſing to be firſt rather amongſt Men of Arms and Power; and therefore never roſe up to that pitch of Eloquence to which Nature would have carried him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diverted by thoſe Expeditions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, which at length gain'd him the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. And he himſelf in his Anſwer to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>'s Panegyric on <hi>Cato,</hi> deſires his Reader not to compare the plain Diſcourſe of a <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:33760:204"/>
with the Harangues of an <hi>Orator,</hi> who had not only fine Parts, but had employed his whole Life in this one Study. When he was returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> he accuſed <hi>Dolabella</hi> of Male-Adminiſtration, and many Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> came in to atteſt it. <hi>Dolabella</hi> was acquitted, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> in return of the favours he had received from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> aſſiſted them in their proſecution of <hi>P. Antonius</hi> for Bribery before <hi>M. Lucullus</hi> Praetor of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia.</hi> In this Cauſe he prevailed ſo far, that <hi>Antonius</hi> was forced to appeal to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes at <hi>Rome,</hi> alledging, that in <hi>Greece</hi> he could not have fair play againſt <hi>Grecians.</hi> In his Pleadings at <hi>Rome</hi> he appeared with all the graces of an Orator, and gained much upon the Affections of the People by the eaſineſs of his Addreſs, and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which he was accompliſht beyond what could be expected from his Age. His Intereſt grew ſtill inſenſibly greater by the open Houſe he kept, and the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his Entertainments; His Enemies ſlighted the growth of it at firſt, in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation it would ſoon fail, when his Money was gone; whilſt in the mean time it was firmly ſetled among the Common People. When his Power at laſt was fixt, and not to be controll'd, and now openly tended to the altering of the whole Conſtitution, they were aware too late, that there is no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:33760:205"/>
ſo mean, which continued application will not make conſiderable, and that ſmall dangers by being deſpiſed at firſt become at laſt irreſiſtible. <hi>Cicero</hi> was the firſt who had any ſuſpicions of his deſigns upon the Government, and (as a good Pilot is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of a Storm when the Sea is calmeſt) ſaw the deſigning temper of the Man thrô this diſguiſe of good humor, and affability, and ſaid upon it; <hi>In all his other actions and intrigues I plainly diſcover the air of a Tyrant; but when I ſee his Hair lie in ſo exact order, and him ſo often adjuſting it, I cannot imagine it ſhould enter into ſuch a Man's thoughts to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Roman State.</hi> But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p>The firſt Proof he had of the People's good Will to him, was, when he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Tribuneſhip in the Army againſt <hi>C. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius.</hi> A ſecond and clearer inſtance of their Favour appeared upon his making an Excellent Oration in praiſe of his Aunt <hi>Julia,</hi> Wife to <hi>Marius,</hi> publickly in the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:</hi> at whoſe Funeral he was ſo bold as to bring forth the Images of <hi>Marius,</hi> which no Body durſt produce ſince the Government came into <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Hands, <hi>Marius</hi>'s Party having from that time been declared Enemies to the State. For when ſome upon this Occaſion exclaimed againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on the other ſide were taken with the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:33760:205"/>
Action, and received it with very great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; admiring him for having revived in the City thoſe Honors of <hi>Marius,</hi> which for ſo long time had been buried. It had always been the cuſtom at <hi>Rome</hi> to make Funeral Orations in praiſe of Ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, but there was no precedent of any upon young Women, till <hi>Caeſar</hi> firſt made one upon the death of his own Wife. This alſo procured him Favour, and by this ſhew of Affection he got the Hearts of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who lookt upon him as a Man of great Tenderneſs and extraordinary good Nature. When he had buried his Wife, he went <hi>Quaeſtor</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> under one <hi>Votus,</hi> who was <hi>Praetor,</hi> whom he Honoured ever after, and made his Son <hi>Quaeſtor,</hi> when he himſelf came to be <hi>Praetor.</hi> When he was out of that Office, he Married <hi>Pompeja</hi> his third Wife, having then a Daughter by <hi>Cornelia</hi> his firſt Wife, whom he afterwards match'd to <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great. He was ſo profuſe in his Expences, that before he had any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employment, he was in debt 1300 Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. Some thought that by being at ſo great a charge to be popular, he changed a real and ſolid good, for what was ſhort, and uncertain: But in truth he purchaſed what was of the greateſt value at an inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rate. When he was made Surveyor of the <hi>Appian</hi> Way, he disburſt beſides the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:33760:206"/>
publick Moneys a great Sum out of his private Purſe; and when he was <hi>Aedile,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſuch a number of Gladiators, that he entertain'd the People with 320 ſeveral Duels; and by his great liberality and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence in Shews, in Pomps, and publick Feaſtings, obſcured the glory of all who went before him, and gain'd ſo much upon the People, that every one was ready to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent new Offices, and new Honors, for him, in return to his Munificence. There being two Factions in the City, one for <hi>Sylla,</hi> which was very powerful, the other for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> which was then broken, and in a very low condition, he was deſirous to raiſe it again, and to bring it over to his Intereſt: To this end, whilſt he was in the heighth of his Repute with the People, for the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Shews he gave as Aedile, he ordered Images, and Statues, with Enſigns of Victory, to be carried privately in the night, and placed in the Capitol. Next morning, when ſome ſaw them glittering with Gold, and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wrought with Inſcriptions of <hi>Marius</hi>'s Exploits over the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> they were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at the boldneſs of him who had ſet them up, nor was it difficult to gueſs who it was. The fame of this ſoon ſpread, and brought together a great Concourſe of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Some preſently cried out that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had deſigns upon the Government, becauſe
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:33760:206"/>
he had revived thoſe Honors which were buried by the Laws, and Decrees of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; that this was done to ſound the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the People, whom he had prepared before, and to try whether they were tame enough to bear his Humor, and would quietly give way to his Innovations. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Marius</hi>'s Party took courage; and 'tis incredible what a multitude of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on a ſudden, and came ſhouting into the Capitol. Many of them when they ſaw <hi>Marius</hi>'s Picture cried for Joy, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> was highly extoll'd as the only Perſon, who was a Relation worthy of <hi>Marius.</hi> Upon this the Senate met, and <hi>Catulus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatius,</hi> one of the moſt eminent Romans of that time, ſtood up, and accuſed <hi>Caeſar,</hi> cloſing his Speech with this remarkable ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Caeſar no longer undermines the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but openly plants his Batteries againſt it.</hi> But when <hi>Caeſar</hi> had made an Apology for himſelf, and ſatisfied the Senate, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers were very much animated, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him not to depart from his own thoughts for any one, ſince he was likely to get the better of them all in a little time, and to be the firſt Man in the State with the Peoples Conſent. At the ſame time <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi> the High-Prieſt died; and <hi>Catulus,</hi> and <hi>Iſauricus,</hi> Perſons of known Reputation, and who bore a great weight in the Senate, were
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:33760:207"/>
Competitors for the Office; yet <hi>Caeſar</hi> would not give way to them, but preſented himſelf to the People as a Candidate againſt them. The ſeveral Intereſts ſeeming very equal, <hi>Catulus,</hi> who becauſe he had the moſt Honor to loſe, was the moſt apprehenſive of the event, ſent to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to buy him off, with Offers of a great Sum of Money: But he ſaid, <hi>He would provide a larger Sum then that to carry on the Competition.</hi> Upon the day of Election, as his Mother con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him out of doors with tears, he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted her, and ſaid; <hi>Well, Mother, to day you'l ſee me either High-Prieſt, or Baniſhed.</hi> When the Votes were taken, after a great ſtruggle, he carried it, and by that gave the Senate and Nobility reaſon to fear he might now draw on the People to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt height of Arrogance. Whereupon <hi>Piſo</hi> and <hi>Catulus</hi> found fault with <hi>Cicero</hi> for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Caeſar</hi> eſcape, when in the Conſpiracy of <hi>Catiline</hi> he had given the Government ſuch advantage againſt him. For <hi>Catiline,</hi> who had deſigned not only to change the preſent State of Affairs, but to ſubvert the whole Conſtitution, and confound all, had himſelf eſcaped, by reaſon the Evidence was not full againſt him, they having not yet gone to the bottom of his Deſign. But he had left <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Cethegus</hi> in the City to ſupply his place in the Conſpiracy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:33760:207"/>
Whether they had any ſecret Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Aſſiſtance from <hi>Caeſar</hi> is uncertain; This is certain, that they were fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed in the Senate, and when <hi>Cicero</hi> the Conſul ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ſeveral Opinions of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, how they would have them puniſh'd, all who ſpake before <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſentenced them to Death, but <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſtood up, and made a ſet Speech, wherein he told them, <hi>That he thought it without Precedent, and not juſt to take away the Lives of two Perſons of their Birth and Quality, before they were fairly tried, unleſs there was an abſolute neceſſity for it; but that if they were kept confin'd in any Town which</hi> Cicero <hi>himſelf ſhould chuſe till</hi> Catiline <hi>was defeated, then the Senate might in peace and at their leiſure determine, what was beſt to be done.</hi> This Sentence of his carried ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Humanity, and he gave it ſo good an air by his Speech, that not only thoſe who ſpoke after him cloſed with it, but even they who had before given a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion, now came over to his; till it came about to <hi>Catulus,</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi>'s turn to ſpeak. They warmly oppoſed it; and <hi>Cato</hi> inſinuated in his Speech ſome ſuſpicions of <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf, and preſt the matter ſo far, that the Criminals were given up to ſuffer Execution. As <hi>Caeſar</hi> was going out of the Senate, many of the young Men who guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Cicero,</hi> ran in with their naked Swords
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:33760:208"/>
to aſſault him. But <hi>Curio,</hi> as it is ſaid, threw his Gown over him, and convey'd him out, and <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf gave a Sign to his Guards, who watch't the motions of his Eye, not to kill him, either for fear of the People, or becauſe he thought the Murder unjuſt and illegal. If this be true, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how <hi>Tully</hi> came to omit it in the Book which he wrote concerning his Conſulſhip. <hi>Cicero</hi> was blam'd afterwards for not making uſe of ſo good an opportunity againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> out of fear of the Populace, who mightily favourd him. Sometime after, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> went into the Senate to clear himſelf of ſome Suſpicions he lay under, he found great clamours rais'd againſt him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Senate ſitting longer then ordinary, the People went up to the Houſe in a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, and beſet it, demanding <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and requiring them to diſmiſs him. Upon this <hi>Cato</hi> much fearing a Mutiny from the poorer ſort, who are always the Incendiaries in a Rebellion, and who now plac'd all their hopes in <hi>Caeſar,</hi> perſuaded the Senate to give them a Monthly allowance of Corn, which put the Commonwealth to the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary charge of 55000 Crowns a year. This Expedient remov'd all fears for the preſent, and very much weaken'd <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s power, who at that time was juſt going to be made <hi>Praetor,</hi> and conſequently would have been
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:33760:208"/>
more formidable by his Office. But there was no diſturbance during his Praetorſhip, only what misfortune he met with in his own Domeſtick Affairs. <hi>P. Clodius</hi> was a Perſon well deſcended, eminent both for his Riches and Eloquence, but in Lewdneſs and Impudence exceeded the very worſt of thoſe, who were remarkable for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery. He was in love with <hi>Pompeja, Caeſar</hi>'s Wife, and ſhe had no averſion to him. But there were ſtrict Guards on her Apartment, and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Mother <hi>Aurclia,</hi> who was a diſcreet Woman, being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually about her, made an Interview very dangerous, and difficult. The <hi>Romans</hi> have a Goddeſs which they call <hi>Bona,</hi> the ſame which the <hi>Greeks</hi> call <hi>Gynaecea:</hi> The <hi>Phrygians,</hi> who claim a peculiar Title to her, ſay ſhe was Mother to <hi>Midas;</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> pretend ſhe was one of the <hi>Dryads,</hi> and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Faunus:</hi> The <hi>Grecians</hi> affirm that ſhe is that Mother of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whoſe Name is not to be utter'd: For this Reaſon the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who celebrate her Feſtival, cover the Tents with Vine-branches, and according to the Fable, a Conſecrated Dragon is plac'd by the Goddeſs. It is not lawful for a Man to be bye, nor ſo much as in the Houſe, whilſt the Sacred Rites are celebrated; but the Women by themſelves perform ſuch Holy Offices, as are much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

us'd in the Solemnities ſacred to <hi>Orpheus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> When the Feſtival comes, the Husband, who is always either <hi>Conſul</hi> or <hi>Praetor,</hi> and with him every Male-creature quits the Houſe; the Wife then taking it under her care, ſets it in order, and there are great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities all night, attended with Dancing, and ſeveral ſorts of Muſick. As <hi>Pompeja</hi> was at that time celebrating this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Feaſt, <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> who as yet had no Beard, and ſo thought to paſs undiſcover'd, took upon him the Habit and Diſguiſe of a Singing-Woman, having the Air of a young Girl, and ſo came thither. Finding the Doors open, he was without any ſtop introduc'd by a young Maid, who was in the Intrigue. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ran to tell <hi>Pompeja,</hi> but being from him a great while, he grew uneaſie in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her, and therefore left his Poſt, and travers'd the Houſe from one Room to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtill taking care to avoid the Lights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till at laſt <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s Woman met him, and invited him to ſuch Recreations as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men uſe among themſelves. He refus'd to comply; but the preſently pull'd him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ask'd him, who he was, and whence? <hi>Clodius</hi> told her he waited for <hi>Aura</hi> one of <hi>Pompeja</hi>'s Maids, and as he ſaid ſo, betray'd himſelf by his Voice: Upon which the Woman ſhrieking, ran into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany where there were Lights, and cried
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:33760:209"/>
out, ſhe had diſcovered a Man. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were all in a fright; <hi>Aurelia</hi> preſently threw a Vail over the Ceremonies, put a ſtop to the <hi>Orgia,</hi> and having order'd the Doors to be ſhut, ran about with Lights to find <hi>Clodius,</hi> who was got into the Maids Room, that he had come in with, and was ſeiz'd there. The Women knew him, and drave him out of Doors, and preſently, thô it was yet night, went home to tell their Husbands the Story. In the morning it was all about Town, what an impious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <hi>Clodius</hi> had made, and all agreed he ought to be puniſh'd as an Offender not only againſt thoſe whom he had affronted, but alſo againſt the Publick, and the Gods. Upon which one of the Tribunes accus'd him of profaning the Holy Rites, and ſome of the Principal Senators came in, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs'd againſt him, that beſides many other horrible Crimes, he had been guilty of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt with his own Siſter, who was Married to <hi>Lucullus.</hi> But the People ſet themſelves againſt the Intereſt of the Nobility, and defended <hi>Clodius;</hi> which was of great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him with the Judges, who were at a ſtand, being afraid to provoke the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. <hi>Caeſar</hi> preſently diſmiſt <hi>Pompeja,</hi> but being ſummon'd as a Witneſs againſt <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> ſaid, <hi>He had nothing to charge him with.</hi> This looking like a Paradox, the Accuſers
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:33760:210"/>
ask'd him, why he parted with his Wife? <hi>Caeſar</hi> replied, <hi>Becauſe I can't bear that my Wife ſhould be ſo much as ſuſpected.</hi> Some ſay that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpake this as his thoughts; Others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he did it to gratifie the People, who were very earneſt to ſave <hi>Clodius.</hi> So <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> got clear of the Indictment, moſt of the Judges giving their Opinions in confus'd terms, that they might not be in danger from the People by condemning him, nor in diſgrace with the Nobility by acquitting him. <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the mean time being out of his Praetorſhip had got the Province of <hi>Spain,</hi> but was in ill Circumſtances with his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, who, as he was going off, came upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and were very preſſing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate; which made him apply himſelf to <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who was the richeſt Man in <hi>Rome,</hi> but wanted <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s vigor and warmth to ſet up againſt <hi>Pompey. Craſſus</hi> took upon him to ſatisfie thoſe Creditors, which were moſt uneaſie to him, and would not be put off any longer, and engag'd himſelf to the value of 830 Talents: Upon which <hi>Caeſar</hi> was now at Liberty to go to his Province. In his Journey as he was croſſing the <hi>Alps,</hi> and paſſing by a ſmall Village of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, which was ſtock'd with but few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and thoſe wretchedly poor, his Friends ſmil'd, and ask'd him by way of raillery, <hi>If there were any canvaſing for Offices</hi>

               <hi>there; any contention which ſhould be uppermoſt, or fewds of great Men one againſt another?</hi> To which <hi>Caeſar</hi> made anſwer very ſeriouſly: <hi>For my part I had rather be the firſt Man among theſe Fellows, then the ſecond Man in</hi> Rome. 'Tis ſaid that another time, being retir'd from Buſineſs, and reading the Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander,</hi> he ſat a great while very thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and at laſt burſt out into Tears. His Friends were ſurpris'd, and ask'd him the Reaſon of it. <hi>Do you think</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I have not juſt cauſe to weep, when I conſider that</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander <hi>at my Age had conquer'd ſo many Nations, and I have all this time done nothing, that is memorable?</hi> As ſoon as he came into <hi>Spain</hi> he was very active, and in a few days had got together 10 new Companies of Foot to thoſe 20 which were there before: With theſe he march'd againſt the <hi>Gallaeci,</hi> and <hi>Luſitani,</hi> conquer'd them, and advancing as far as the Ocean, ſubdu'd thoſe Nations, which never before had been ſubject to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Having manag'd his Military Affairs with good ſucceſs, he was equally happy in the Courſe of his Civil Government; For he eſtabliſh'd a good Underſtanding amongſt the ſeveral States, and took eſpecial Care to heal the differences betwixt Debtors and Creditors. He order'd that the Creditor ſhould receive two parts of the Debtor's yearly Income, and that the other part
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:33760:211"/>
ſhould be manag'd by the Debtor himſelf, till by this method the whole Debt was at laſt diſcharg'd. This Conduct made him leave his Province with a fair reputation; being rich himſelf, and having enrich'd his Soldiers, who therefore Complimented him with the Title of <hi>Emperor.</hi> There is a Law among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that whoever deſires the Honor of a <hi>Triumph</hi> muſt ſtay without the City, and expect his Anſwer: And another, that thoſe who put in for the <hi>Conſulſhip</hi> ſhall appear perſonally upon the place: <hi>Caeſar</hi> was come home at the very time of chuſing Conſuls, and being in a ſtrait between theſe two oppoſite Laws, ſent to the Senate to deſire, that ſince he was oblig'd to be abſent, he might appear for the Conſulſhip by Proxy. <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o</hi> being back'd by the Law, at firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his requeſt; afterwards perceiving that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had prevail'd with a great part of the Senate to comply with it, he made it his buſineſs to gain time, and waſted an whole day in Harangues: Upon which <hi>Caeſar</hi> thought fit to let the <hi>Triumph</hi> fall, and purſu'd the <hi>Conſulſhip.</hi> He advances therefore preſently, and enters upon a project which deceiv'd all but <hi>Cato.</hi> This was the reconciling of <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> who then bore the greateſt weight in <hi>Rome.</hi> There had been a quarrel between them, which he quickly made up; and by this means ſtrengthen'd himſelf by
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:33760:211"/>
the united power of both; and ſo privately undermin'd the Government, under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of an Action which carried in it all the appearance of a good Office. For it was not the quarrel betwixt <hi>Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as moſt Men imagine, which was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Civil Wars, but their Union; they conſpiring at firſt to ſubvert the Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy, and quarrelling at laſt betwixt themſelves, which ſhould be Monarch. <hi>Cato,</hi> who often foretold what the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this Alliance would be, had then the Character of a ſullen and buſie Man, and afterwards the Reputation of a wiſe, but unfortunate Counſellor. Thus <hi>Caeſar</hi> being doubly guarded with the Intereſts of of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> was promoted to the Conſulate, and declar'd publickly with <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnius Bibulus.</hi> When he was fix't in his Office he brought in Bills, which would have been preferr'd with better grace by a bold <hi>Tribune,</hi> then by a <hi>Conſul;</hi> in which he propos'd tranſplantation of Colonies, and Diviſion of Lands, on purpoſe to oblige the Commonalty. The beſt and moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable of the Senators oppos'd it, upon which, having long waited for ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable pretence, he openly proteſted how unwillingly he was driven upon applications to the People, and how neceſſary it was to make his Addreſſes that way, and to enter
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:33760:212"/>
into their Intereſts, ſince he had receiv'd ſo many Affronts, and found ſo much Sullen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Senate. When he had ſaid this, he ask'd <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> who ſat on each ſide of him, Whether they conſented to the Bills he had propos'd? They own'd their Aſſent, upon which he deſir'd them to aſſiſt him againſt thoſe who had threatned to oppoſe him with their Swords. They engag'd they would, and <hi>Pompey</hi> added far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>he would not only meet their Swords with a Sword in his Hand, but that he would bring a Buckler with him beſides.</hi> This Speech the Nobles reſented, as neither ſuitable to his gravity, nor becoming the Reverence due to that Aſſembly, but ſuch as had an air of levity and raſhneſs: But the People were pleas'd with it. <hi>Caeſar</hi> that he might work himſelf yet deeper into the Intereſt of <hi>Pompey,</hi> gave him his Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> who had before been contracted to <hi>Servilius Caepio,</hi> and told <hi>Servilius</hi> he ſhould have <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Daughter, who was not unprovided neither, but deſign'd for <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Son, <hi>Fauſtus.</hi> A little time after <hi>Caeſar</hi> Married <hi>Calpurnia</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Piſo,</hi> and made <hi>Piſo</hi> Conſul for the year following. <hi>Cato</hi> exclaim'd loudly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, and proteſted with a great deal of warmth, that it was intolerable the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould be proſtituted by theſe Marriages, and that they ſhould advance
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:33760:212"/>
one another to the Commands of Armies, Provinces, and other great Poſts by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Women. <hi>Bibulus, Caeſar</hi>'s Collegue finding it was to no purpoſe to oppoſe his Bills, but that he was in danger of being murder'd in the <hi>Forum,</hi> as alſo was <hi>Cato,</hi> confin'd himſelf to his Houſe, and there wore out the remaining part of his Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <hi>Pompey</hi> when he was Married, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fill'd the <hi>Forum</hi> with Soldiers, and ſo ſecur'd to the People their new Laws, and to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Government of all <hi>Gaul,</hi> both on this and the other ſide of the <hi>Alps,</hi> together with <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and the command of 4 Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions for 5 years. <hi>Cato</hi> made ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt theſe proceedings, but was ſent to Priſon by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who ſuſpected he would appeal to the Tribunes. But when <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaw that he went along without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word, and that not only the Nobility diſreliſh'd it, but that the People alſo out of their Veneration to <hi>Cato</hi>'s Virtue waited on him, and by their ſilence and dejected looks expreſt a great concern for him; he himſelf privately deſir'd one of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes to reſcue <hi>Cato.</hi> As for the other Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, ſome few of them attended the Houſe; the reſt being diſguſted, abſented themſelves. Hence <hi>Conſidius,</hi> a very old Man, took occaſion one day to tell <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that <hi>the Senators did not meet becauſe they were</hi>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:33760:213"/>
               <hi>afraid of his Soldiers. Caeſar</hi> preſently ask'd him, <hi>Why don't you then out of the ſame fear keep at home?</hi> To which the old Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that <hi>Age was his guard againſt Fear, and that the ſmall Remains of his Life were not worth much Caution.</hi> But the fouleſt thing that was done in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Conſulſhip was his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting <hi>Clodius</hi> to be Tribune, that very <hi>Clodius</hi> who had attempted to diſhonour his Bed, and who contrary to all Piety had polluted the holy and myſterious Vigils. Now he was prefer'd in oppoſition to <hi>Cicero,</hi> nor did <hi>Caeſar</hi> take the Field, till they had overpower'd <hi>Cicero,</hi> and drove him out of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far have we deduc'd <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Actions before the Wars of <hi>Gaul.</hi> After this he ſeems to have begun his Courſe afreſh, and to have enter'd upon a new, and different Scene of Action. The Progreſs of thoſe Battels which he afterwards fought, and thoſe many Expeditions in which he ſubdu'd the <hi>Gauls,</hi> ſhew him to have been a Soldier and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral not in the leaſt inferior to any of thoſe great and admired Commanders, who have appear'd at the Heads of Armies. For if we compare him with the <hi>Fabii,</hi> the <hi>Metelli,</hi> the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, and with thoſe who were his Contemporaries, or not long before him, <hi>Sylla, Marius,</hi> the 2 <hi>Luculli,</hi> or even <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf, whoſe Glory reach't the Heavens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:33760:213"/>
we ſhall find <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Actions to have ſurpaſt them all. One he excel'd on the account of the difficulty of the places where he fought: Another in reſpect of the large extent of Country which he over-ran: Some in the Number and Strength of the Enemies, whom he conquer'd; and ſome in the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and barbarity of their tempers, whom he poliſh'd and civiliz'd: Others yet in his Humanity and Clemency to thoſe he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd, and others in his Gifts, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities to his Soldiers: All in the Number of the Battles which he fought, and the Enemies, which he kill'd. For he had not purſu'd the Wars in <hi>Gaul</hi> full 10 years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took by Storm 800 Towns, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd 300 States; and of the 3 millions of Men, which made up the groſs of thoſe, with whom at ſeveral times he engag'd, he kill'd one, and took a ſecond. He was ſo much Maſter of the good Will, and hearty ſervice of his Soldiers, that thoſe who in other Expeditions were but ordinary Men, carried with them a force not to be reſiſted or ſhaken, when they went upon any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, where <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s glory was concern'd. Such an one was <hi>Acilius,</hi> who in a Sea-fight before <hi>Marſeilles</hi> had his Right Hand ſtruck off with a Sword, yet did not quit his Buckler out of his Left, but gaul'd the Enemies in the Face with it, till he defeated
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:33760:214"/>
them, and made himſelf Maſter of the Veſſel. Such another was <hi>Caſſius Scaera,</hi> who in a Battle near <hi>Dyrrhachium</hi> had one of his Eyes pick'd out with an Arrow, his Shoulder pierc'd with one Javelin, and his Thigh with another, and having receiv'd 130 Darts upon his Target call'd to the Enemy, as thô he would ſurrender himſelf; but when two of them came up to him, he cut off the Shoulder of one with a Sword, and by a blow over the Face forc'd the other to retire, whilſt with the Aſſiſtance of his own Party he made his eſcape. Again in <hi>Britain,</hi> when ſome of the chief Officers were accidentally faln into a Moraſs full of Water, and there aſſaulted by the Enemy, a common Soldier, whilſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſtood and look'd on, threw himſelf into the midſt of them, and after many and ſignal demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of his Valour, reſcu'd the Officers, and beat off the Barbarians. At laſt he took the Water, and with much ado, partly by ſwimming, partly by wading, paſs'd it, but in the paſſage loſt his Shield. <hi>Caeſar</hi> admir'd him, and went to meet him with joy and acclamation; but the Soldier very much dejected, and in tears threw himſelf down at <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s feet, and beg'd his pardon, that he had let go his Buckler. Another time in <hi>Afric, Scipio</hi> having taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Ship of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, in which <hi>Granius Petronius,</hi> one lately
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:33760:214"/>
made <hi>Queſtor</hi> was paſſing, he gave the other Paſſengers as free prize to his Soldiers, but thought fit to give the <hi>Queſtor</hi> his Life: But he ſaid, <hi>it was not uſual for</hi> Caeſar's <hi>Soldiers to take, but give Life,</hi> and having ſaid ſo, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an upon his Sword and kill'd himſelf. Theſe Principles and Notions of Honour were inſpir'd into them, and cheriſh'd in them by <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſar</hi> himſelf, who by his liberal diſtribution of Money and Honours ſhew'd them that he did not from the Wars heap up Wealth for his own Luxury, or the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his private Pleaſure, but that he took care to ſettle a ſure Fund for the reward and encouragement of Valour, and that he look'd upon himſelf only rich in that, which he gave to deſerving Soldiers. There was no danger to which he did not willingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf; no labour from which he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an exemption. His contempt of danger was not ſo much admir'd by his Soldiers, becauſe they knew how much he lov'd Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: But his enduring ſo much hardſhip, which he did to all appearance beyond his Natural Strength, very much aſtoniſh'd them. For he was a ſpare Man, had a ſoft and white Skin, was diſtemper'd in the Head, and ſubject to an Epilepſie, which 'tis ſaid firſt ſeiz'd him at <hi>Corduba.</hi> But he did not make the weakneſs of his Conſtitution a pretext for his Eaſe, but us'd War as the beſt
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:33760:215"/>
Phyſick againſt his Indiſpoſitions, whilſt by unwearied Travels, courſe Diet, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent lodging in the Fields, he ſtrugled with his Diſeaſes, and prepar'd his Body againſt all attacks. He ſlept generally in his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots or Litters, and employ'd even his <hi>Reſt</hi> in purſuit of <hi>Action,</hi> In the day he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Caſtles, Gariſons, or Fortifications in his Chariot, one Servant riding with him, who us'd to write down what he dictated as he went, and a Soldier attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind, with his Sword drawn. He drove ſo briskly, that when he firſt ſet out from <hi>Rome</hi> he arriv'd at the River <hi>Rhoan</hi> within 8 days. He had been an expert Rider from his Childhood, for it was uſual with him to hold his hands cloſe behind him, and to put his Horſe to full ſpeed. But in the Wars he had improv'd himſelf ſo far as to dictate Letters from on Horſeback, and to direct himſelf to two, who took Notes at the ſame time, or as <hi>Oppius</hi> ſaith, to more. And 'tis thought that he was the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt who found out a new way of Converſing with his Friends by Cyphers, when either through multitude of buſineſs, or the large extent of the City, he had not time for a Perſonal Conference about ſuch Incidents as requir'd a ſudden diſpatch. How little nice he was in his Diet, we have this remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. When <hi>Valerius Leo</hi> invited him one
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:33760:215"/>
night to Supper, and Treated him with a <hi>Sparagus,</hi> upon which in ſtead of Oyl he had pour'd a ſweet Oyntment, <hi>Caeſar</hi> fed on it without any diſguſt, and reprimanded his Friends for finding fault with it. <hi>For it was enough,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>not to eat, what you did not like; but he who reflects on another Man's want of breeding, ſhews he wants it as much himſelf.</hi> Another time upon the Road he was driven by a Storm into a poor Man's Cottage, where he found but one Room, and that ſuch as would afford but a mean Reception to a ſingle Perſon, and therefore he told his Companions, that <hi>the moſt Honourable Places ought to be given to the beſt Men, but the moſt Neceſſary Accommodations to the weakeſt;</hi> and accordingly order'd that <hi>Oppius,</hi> who was infirm, ſhould lodge within, whilſt he and the reſt ſlept under a Shed at the Door. His firſt War in <hi>Gaul</hi> was againſt the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetians</hi> and <hi>Tigurines,</hi> who having burnt 12 of their own Towns, and 400 Villages, would have march'd forward through that part of <hi>Gaul,</hi> which was under the <hi>Roman</hi> Province, as the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> and <hi>Teutons</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had done. Nor were they inferior to theſe in Courage; and in Numbers they were equal, being in all Three hundred thouſand, of which One hundred and ninety thouſand were fighting Men. <hi>Caeſar</hi> did not engage the <hi>Tigurines</hi> in Perſon, but <hi>Latienus,</hi>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:33760:216"/>
who was Commiſſion'd by him, routed them about the River <hi>Arar.</hi> But the <hi>Helvetians</hi> ſurpriz'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and unexpectedly ſet upon him as he was conducting his Army to a Confederate Town. However he manag'd it ſo as to get into a place well fortified, where when he had muſter'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and marſhal'd his Men, his Horſe was brought to him; upon which he ſaid, <hi>When I have won the Battel, I'le uſe my Horſe for the Chaſe, but at preſent let us go againſt the Enemy:</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he charged them furiouſly on foot. After a long and ſharp Engagement he drove the main Army out of the Field, but found the tougheſt work at their Carriages and Ramparts, where not only the Men ſtood, and fought, but the Women alſo and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren defended themſelves, till they were cut to pieces; inſomuch that the Fight was ſcarce ended till midnight. This Action in it ſelf very great, <hi>Caeſar</hi> crown'd with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more glorious by gathering in a Body all the Barbarians that had eſcap'd out of the Battel, above 100000 in number, and obliging them to repair to the Countrey which they had deſerted, and the Cities which they had burnt. Which he did for fear the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould paſs the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and poſſeſs themſelves of the Country whilſt it lay uninhabited. His ſecond War was in favour of the <hi>Gauls</hi> againſt the <hi>Germans,</hi> thô
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:33760:216"/>
ſometime before he had made <hi>Arioviſtus,</hi> their King, own'd at <hi>Rome</hi> as an Allie. But they were very inſufferable Neighbours to thoſe under his Obedience, and it was probable, when Occaſion ſhew'd, they would be uneaſie under their preſent poſture, and would make Incurſions into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and ſeize it. But finding his Commanders timorous, and eſpecially thoſe of the young Nobility and Gentry, who came along with him in hopes of making uſe of that Expedition to their Pleaſure, or Profit, he call'd them together, and advis'd them to march off, and not to run the hazard of a Battel againſt their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, ſince they were ſo effeminately, and cowardly diſpoſed; telling them withall, that he would take only the 10th Legion, and march againſt the Barbarians, whom he did not expect to find an Enemy more formidable than the <hi>Cimbri,</hi> nor ſhould they find him a General inferior to <hi>Marius.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this the 10th Legion deputed ſome of their Body to pay him their Compliments of Thanks, and the other Legions blam'd their Officers, and with great vigor and zeal follow'd him many days Journey, till they encamp'd within 200 furlongs of the Enemy. <hi>Arioviſtus</hi>'s Courage was cool'd upon their very approach; for not expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould attack the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were known to be Men likely to ſtand
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:33760:217"/>
a Charge, he admir'd <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Conduct, and ſaw his own Army under a great Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. They were ſtill more diſcourag'd by the Propheſies of their Holy Women, who by obſerving the Whirl-pools of Rivers, and taking Omens from the windings and noiſe of Brooks, foretold ſtrange Events, and warn'd them not to engage before the next New Moon appear'd. <hi>Caeſar</hi> having had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of this, and ſeeing the <hi>Germans</hi> lie ſtill, thought it expedient to attack them, whilſt they were under theſe Apprehenſions, rather then ſit ſtill, and wait their Time. Accordingly he made his approaches to their Fortifications and Outworks, within which they were intrench'd, and ſo gall'd, and fretted them, that at laſt they came down with great fury to engage. But he gain'd a glorious Victory, and purſu'd them for 300 furlongs as far as the <hi>Rhine;</hi> all which ſpace was cover'd with Spoils, and Bodies of the Slain. <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> made ſhift to paſs the <hi>Rhine</hi> with the ſmall Remains of an Army; for it is ſaid the number of the ſlain amounted to 80000. After this Action <hi>Caeſar</hi> left his Army at their Winter-Quarters in the Country of the <hi>Sequani,</hi> and in order to attend his Affairs at <hi>Rome,</hi> went into that part of <hi>Gaul,</hi> which lies on the <hi>Po,</hi> and was part of his <hi>Province,</hi> for the River <hi>Rubicon</hi> divides <hi>Gaul,</hi> which is on this ſide the <hi>Alps</hi>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:33760:217"/>
from the reſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> There he ſat down, and gain'd the favour of the People, who made their Court to him frequently, and always found their Requeſts anſwer'd; for he never fail'd to diſmiſs any without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pledges of his favour in hand, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hopes for the future. During all this time of the War in <hi>Gaul, Pompey</hi> never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, how on one ſide <hi>Caeſar</hi> conquer'd his Enemies with the Arms of <hi>Rome,</hi> and on the other ſide gain'd upon the <hi>Romans,</hi> and captivated them with the Money which he had got from his Enemies. But when <hi>Caeſar</hi> heard that the <hi>Belgae,</hi> who were the moſt powerful of all the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and inhabited a third part of the Country were revolted, and that they had got together a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand Men in Arms, he immediately directed his Courſe that way with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and falling upon the Enemy, as they were ravaging the <hi>Gauls</hi> his Allies, he ſoon defeated them, and put them to flight. For though their numbers were great, yet they made but a ſlender defence; ſo that the Marſhes and deep Rivers were made paſſable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot by the vaſt quantity of dead Bodies. Of thoſe who revolted, all that liv'd near the Ocean came over without fighting, and therefore he led his Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Nervi,</hi> who are the moſt uncivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd and moſt warlike People of all in thoſe
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:33760:218"/>
parts. Theſe live in a cloſe, Woody Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and having lodg'd their Children, and their Goods in a deep hollow within a large Foreſt, fell upon <hi>Caeſar</hi> with a Body of 60000 Men before he was prepar'd for them, and while he was making his Encampment. They ſoon routed his Cavalry, and having ſurrounded the 12th and 7th Legions kill'd all the Officers; and had not <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf ſnatch'd up a Buckler, and forced his way through his own Men to come up to the Barbarians, or had not the 10th Legion, when they ſaw him in danger, ran in from the tops of the Hills, where they lay, and broke through the Enemies Ranks to reſcue him, in all probability his Army had been entirely cut off. But through the Influence of <hi>Caeſars</hi> Valour, the <hi>Romans</hi> in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict exerted more then their ordinary Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; yet with the utmoſt ſtreins of their Valour, they were not able to beat the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my out of the Field, but cut them off fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their own defence. For out of 60000 Soldiers not above 500 ſurvived the Battle, and of 400 of their Senators not above three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate had received News of this they voted Sacrifices and Feſtivals to the Gods to be ſtrictly obſerved for the ſpace of 15 days, which is a longer ſpace then ever was obſerved for any Victory before. For the danger appear'd great, becauſe they

were engag'd with ſo many States at once, and the favour of the People to <hi>Caeſar</hi> made the Victory more eſteem'd becauſe he was Conqueror. He was now retir'd to his Winter-Quarters by the <hi>Po,</hi> where after he had ſetled the Affairs of <hi>Gaul,</hi> he reſided in order to the forming his deſigns at <hi>Rome.</hi> All who were Candidates for Offices us'd his Aſſiſtance, and were ſupplied with Money from him to corrupt the People, and buy their Votes, in return of which, when they were choſe, they did all things to advance his Power. But what was more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the moſt eminent and powerful Men in <hi>Rome</hi> in great Numbers made their Court to him at <hi>Lucca,</hi> as, <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſſus,</hi> and <hi>Appius</hi> the Praetor of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Nepos</hi> the Proconſul of <hi>Spain;</hi> ſo that there were upon the place at one time 120 Lictors, and more then 200 Senators, who held a Council, and then parted. There it was decreed, that <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſſus</hi> ſhould be Conſuls again for the following year; that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould have a freſh ſupply of Money, and that his Command ſhould be renew'd to him for 5 years more. It ſeem'd very extravagant to all thinking Men, that thoſe very Perſons who had receiv'd ſo much Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſhould perſuade the Senate to grant him more as if he wanted, though indeed they did not ſo much perſuade as
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:33760:219"/>
compel the Senate, who at the ſame time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted what they were forc'd to paſs. <hi>Cato</hi> was not preſent, for they had ſent him aſide very ſeaſonably into <hi>Cyprus;</hi> but <hi>Favonius,</hi> who was a zealous imitator of <hi>Cato,</hi> when he found he could do no good by oppoſing it, broke out of the Houſe, and loudly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd againſt theſe Proceedings to the People. But none gave him hearing; ſome ſlighting him out of reſpect to <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> others, to gratifie <hi>Caeſar,</hi> on whom depended all their hopes. After this <hi>Caeſar</hi> return'd again to his Forces in <hi>Gaul,</hi> where he found that Country involv'd in a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous War, two ſtrong People of the <hi>Germans</hi> having lately paſt the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads into it; One of them call'd <hi>Ipes,</hi> the other <hi>Tenterides.</hi> Of the War with this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf has given this Account in his Commentaries; That the Barbarians having ſent Ambaſſadors to treat with him, did during the Treaty ſet upon him in his march, by which means with 800 Men they routed 5000 of his Horſe, who did not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their coming; that afterwards they ſent other Ambaſſadors to purſue the ſame fraudulent practices, whom he kept in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody, and led on his Army againſt the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, as judging it would betray too much Eaſineſs, if he ſhould keep Faith with thoſe who broke their Promiſes, and could
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:33760:219"/>
not be oblig'd by any League. <hi>Canuſius</hi> ſaith, that when the Senate decreed Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and Sacrifices for this Victory, <hi>Cato</hi> declar'd it to be his Opinion that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ought to be given into the hands of the Barbarians, that ſo the guilt which this breach of Faith might otherwiſe bring upon the Publick, might be expiated by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Curſe on him, who was the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it. Of thoſe which paſt the <hi>Rhine</hi> there were 400000 cut off; thoſe few which eſcaped were ſhelter'd by the <hi>Sicambri,</hi> a People of <hi>Germany. Caeſar</hi> took hold of this pretence to invade the <hi>Germans,</hi> being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ambitious of glory, and eſpecially of the Honour of being the firſt Man that ſhould paſs the <hi>Rhine</hi> with an Army. He preſently laid a Bridge over it, though it was very wide, and in that place deeper than ordinary, and at the ſame time very rough and fierce, carrying down with its Stream Trunks of Trees, and other Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which much ſhock'd and weaken'd the foundations of his Bridge. But he drove great Planks of Wood into the bottom of the River above the Bridge, both to reſiſt the impreſſion of ſuch Bodies, and to break the force of the Torrent, and by this means he finiſh'd his Bridge, which no one who ſaw could believe it to be the Work of but 10 days. In the paſſage of his Army over it,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:33760:220"/>
he met with no oppoſition, the <hi>Suevi</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who are the moſt Warlike People of all <hi>Germany,</hi> flying with their Effects into the cloſeſt and moſt woody part of the Vales. When he had burnt all the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and encourag'd thoſe who had remain'd firm to the <hi>Roman</hi> Intereſt, he went back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Gaul</hi> after 18 days ſtay in <hi>Germany.</hi> But his Expedition into <hi>Britain</hi> gave the moſt ſignal Teſtimony of his Courage, for he was the firſt who brought a Navy into the Weſtern Ocean, or who ſail'd through the Atlantick with an Army to make War; and though the Iſland is of ſo incredible an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that it has given room to Hiſtorians to diſpute, whether ſuch an Iſland really be in Nature, or whether 'tis a bare Name and Fiction, yet he attempted to conquer it, and to carry the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire beyond the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the known World. He paſt thither twice from that part of <hi>Gaul,</hi> which lies over-againſt it, and in ſeveral Battles which he fought, did more diſſervice to the Enemy, than ſervice to himſelf; for the Iſlanders were ſo miſerably poor, that they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth being plundred of. When he found himſelf unable to put ſuch an end to the War as he wiſh'd, he was content to take Hoſtages from the King, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome Taxes, and then quitted the Iſland. At his arrival in <hi>Gaul</hi> he found Letters which
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:33760:220"/>
lay ready to be convey'd over the Water to him, from his Friends at <hi>Rome</hi> to give him Notice of his Daughters death, who died in Labour of a Child by <hi>Pompey. Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> were much afflicted with her Death, nor were their Friends leſs diſturb'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe that Alliance was now quite broke, which had hitherto kept the Commonwealth in Peace and Amity; for the Child alſo died within a few days after the Mother. The People took the Body of <hi>Julia</hi> by force from the Tribunes, and buried it in the <hi>Campus Martius</hi> with all Solemnities proper on that Occaſion. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army was now grown very numerous, ſo that he was forc'd to diſperſe them into ſeveral Winter-Quarters, and being gone himſelf towards <hi>Rome,</hi> as he us'd to do, there was a ſudden Rupture in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and great Armies were on their march about the Country, who beat up the <hi>Romans</hi> Quarters, and attempted to make themſelves Maſters of the Forts, where they lay. The greateſt and ſtrongeſt Party of the Rebels under the Command of <hi>Ambiorix</hi> cut off <hi>Cotta,</hi> and <hi>Titurius,</hi> with their Army. After that the Enemies inveſted a Town, (where <hi>Cicero</hi> lay with his Legion) with an Army of 60000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men, and had almoſt taken it by Storm, the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers in it being all wounded, and having quite ſpent themſelves by a brisk and vigorous defence beyond their
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:33760:221"/>
Natural ſtrength: But <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who was at a great diſtance, having receiv'd notice of this, quickly got together 7000 Men, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd to relieve <hi>Cicero.</hi> The Beſiegers were aware of it, and went to meet him, with great confidence that they ſhould with eaſe devour ſuch an handful of Men. <hi>Caeſar</hi> to nouriſh their preſumption ſeem'd to avoid fighting, and ſtill march'd off till he found a place conveniently ſituate for a few to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage againſt many, where he encamp'd. He kept his Souldiers from making any Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Enemy, and commanded them to raiſe a Bulwark, and to build ſtrong Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricadoes, that by ſhew of fear, they might heighten the Enemies contempt of them; till at laſt they came without any order in great ſecurity to make an Attack, when he made a Sally, and put them to flight with the loſs of many Men. This quieted many Commotions in theſe parts of <hi>Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> made his progreſs through ſeveral parts of the Country, and with great vigilance provided againſt all Innovations. At that time there were 3 Legions come to him by way of Recruits for the Men he had loſt; of which <hi>Pompey</hi> furniſh'd him with two out of thoſe under his Command; the other was newly rais'd in that part of <hi>Gaul</hi> which is by the <hi>Po.</hi> After this the Seeds of War, which had long ſince been ſecretly ſown
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:33760:221"/>
and ſcatter'd by the moſt powerful Men in thoſe Warlike Nations, broke forth, and ripen'd into the greateſt and moſt dangerous War that ever was in thoſe parts, both for the number of Men in the vigor of their Youth, and quantity of Arms, which were gather'd from all parts, and the vaſt Funds of Money laid up for this purpoſe, and the ſtrength of Towns, and ſituation of places by which they were inacceſſible. It being Winter, the Rivers were frozen, the Woods cover'd with Snow, and the Fields overflow'd; ſo that in ſome places the Ways were loſt through the depth of the Snow; in others, the overflowing of Bogs and Brooks made the paſſage very dangerous: All which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties made it ſeem impracticable to <hi>Caeſar</hi> to make any attempt upon the Rebels. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny States had revolted together; the chief of them were the <hi>Arverni,</hi> and <hi>Carnutes;</hi> the General who had the Supream Command in War was <hi>Vercingetorix,</hi> whoſe Father the <hi>Gauls</hi> had put to death on ſuſpicion he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected abſolute Government. He having diſpos'd his Army in ſeveral Bodies, and ſet Officers over them, drew over to him all the Country round about as far as thoſe that lie upon <hi>Arar,</hi> and having Intelligence of the Oppoſition which <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Affairs now found at <hi>Rome,</hi> thought to engage all <hi>Gaul</hi> in the War. Which if he had done a little
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:33760:222"/>
later, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> was taken up with the Civil Wars, <hi>Italy</hi> had been put into as great fears, as before it was by the <hi>Cimbri.</hi> But at this time <hi>Caeſar</hi> who was of a <hi>Genius</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fitted to make a right uſe of all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in War, as ſoon as he heard of the Revolt, return'd immediately the ſame way he went, and ſhew'd the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, by the quickneſs of his march in ſuch a tempeſtuous ſeaſon, that the Army which was advancing againſt them was invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible. For in time that one would have thought it ſcarce credible that a Courier, or Expreſs ſhould have come ſo far, he appear'd with all his Army; in his march he ravaged the Country, demoliſh'd the Forts, and receiv'd into his protection thoſe who declar'd for him; till at laſt the <hi>Hedui</hi> oppos'd him, who before had ſtyl'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Brethren to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and had been much honour'd by them, but now joyn'd the Rebels to the great diſcouragement of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army. Wherefore he remov'd thence, and paſt the Country of the <hi>Lingones,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to touch upon the Territories of the <hi>Sequani,</hi> who were his Allies, and are ſituate next to <hi>Italy</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>Gaul.</hi> There the Enemy came upon him, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded him with many Myriads, whom he was eager enough to engage; and had the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:33760:222"/>
advantage of them upon all accounts, and at laſt through the length of time and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his Name, quite defeated them. But he ſeems to have made ſome falſe ſteps at firſt, and the <hi>Arverni</hi> ſhew you a Sword hanging up in a Temple, which they ſay was taken from <hi>Caeſar.</hi> This <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaw af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and ſmil'd at it, and when his Friends advis'd it ſhould be taken down, would not permit it, becauſe he look'd upon it as conſecrated. After the defeat a great part of thoſe who had eſcap'd, fled with their King into a Town call'd <hi>Alexia,</hi> which <hi>Caeſar</hi> beſieged, though for the heighth of the Walls, and number of thoſe who were in Gariſon, it ſeem'd impregnable. During the Siege he met with greater danger with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Town, then can be expreſt. For the choice Men of <hi>Gaul,</hi> pick'd out of each Nation, and well Arm'd, came to relieve <hi>Alexia,</hi> to the number of Three hundred thouſand; nor were there in the Town leſs than 170 thouſand: So that <hi>Caeſar</hi> being ſhut up betwixt two ſuch Armies, was forc'd to raiſe two Walls, one towards the Town, the other againſt the new Supplies, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if theſe Forces ſhould join, his Affairs would be intirely ruin'd. The danger that he underwent before <hi>Alexia</hi> did juſtly gain him great Honour, and gave him an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſhewing greater Inſtances of his
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:33760:223"/>
Valour and Conduct, than any other Battle ever did. One would wonder very much how he ſhould engage and defeat ſo many thouſands of Men without the Town, and not be perceiv'd by thoſe within: but much more, that the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves who guarded their Wall which was next the Town ſhould be Strangers to it. For even they knew nothing of the Victory till they heard the cries of the Men, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Women, who were in the Town, and had from thence ſeen the <hi>Romans</hi> at a diſtance carrying into their Camp a great quantity of Bucklers adorn'd with Gold and Silver, many Breaſt-plates ſtain'd with Blood, beſides Cups and Tents made after the <hi>Gallic</hi> mode. So ſoon was ſo vaſt an Army diſſipated, and vaniſh'd like a Ghoſt or Dream, the greateſt part of them being kill'd upon the ſpot. Thoſe which were in <hi>Alexia</hi> having given themſelves and <hi>Caeſar</hi> much trouble ſurrendred at laſt; and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingetorix,</hi> who was the chief Spring of all the War, with his beſt Armour on, and well mounted, rode out of the Gates, and took a Turn about <hi>Caeſar</hi> as he was ſitting; then quitted his Horſe, threw off his Armour, and laid himſelf quietly at <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s feet, who committed him to Cuſtody to be reſerv'd for a Triumph.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:33760:223"/>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> had long ſince deſign'd to ruine <hi>Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> him; for <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who had hitherto kept them in Peace, being ſlain in <hi>Parthia,</hi> the one wanted nothing to make himſelf the greateſt Man in <hi>Rome,</hi> but the fall of him, who was ſo; Nor had the other any way to prevent his own ruine, but by being before-hand with him whom he fear'd. But <hi>Pompey</hi> had not been long under ſuch apprehenſions, having till that time deſpis'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as thinking it no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to cruſh him whom he himſelf had advanc'd. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> had entertain'd this deſign from the beginning againſt his Rivals, and had retir'd like an expert Wreſtler, to prepare himſelf for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat; He had improv'd the ſtrength of his Souldiery by exerciſing e'm in the <hi>Gallic</hi> Wars, and had heighten'd his own glory by his great Actions, ſo that he was look'd on, as one that vied with <hi>Pompey.</hi> Nor did he let go any of thoſe advantages, which were now given him both by <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf, and the times, and the ill Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby all who were Candidates for Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices publickly gave Money, and without any ſhame brib'd the Pople, who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their pay did not contend for their Benefactors with their bare Suffrages, but with Bows, Swords, and Slings; ſo that they ſeldom parted without having ſtain'd
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:33760:224"/>
the place of Election with the Blood of Men kill'd upon the ſpot; by which the City was brought to confuſion like a Ship with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Pilot; ſo that the Wiſer part wiſh'd things which were carried on with ſo much Tumult and fury might end no worſe then in a Monarchy. Some were ſo bold as to declare openly, that the Government was incurable but by a Monarchy, and that they ought to take that Remedy from the Hands of the gentleſt Phyſician, meaning <hi>Pompey,</hi> who though in words he pretended to decline it, yet in reality he made his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Efforts to be declar'd Dictator. <hi>Cato</hi> perceiving his deſign prevail'd with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to make him ſole Conſul, that he might not aim at the Dictatorſhip, being taken off with the offer of a more legal ſort of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. They over and above voted him the continuance of his Provinces; for he had two, <hi>Spain,</hi> and all <hi>Afric,</hi> which he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by his Deputies, and maintain'd Armies under him at the yearly charge of 10000 Talents out of the publick Treaſury. Upon this <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo by his Proxies demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Conſulate, and the continuance of his Provinces. <hi>Pompey</hi> at firſt did not ſtir in it, but <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Lentulus</hi> oppos'd it, who had always hated <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and now did every thing, whether fit or unfit, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ht diſgrace, and expoſe him. For they
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:33760:224"/>
took away the freedom of <hi>Rome</hi> from the <hi>Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comians,</hi> who were a Colony that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had lately planted in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who was then Conſul, order'd one of the Senators of that City, then at <hi>Rome,</hi> to be whipt, and told him he laid that mark upon him to ſignifie he was no Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> bidding him, when he went back again, to ſhew it <hi>Caeſar.</hi> After <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s Conſulate, <hi>Caeſar</hi> preſented large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the great Stateſmen out of the Riches he had taken from the <hi>Gauls;</hi> diſcharg'd <hi>Curio</hi> the Tribune from his great Debts; gave <hi>Paulus,</hi> then Conſul, 1500 Talents, with which he built a noble Palace joining to the <hi>Forum,</hi> in the place where that of <hi>Fulvius</hi> had ſtood. <hi>Pompey</hi> jealous of theſe Preparations, did now openly practiſe both by himſelf and his Friends, to have a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor declar'd to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ſent to rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thoſe Souldiers whom he had lent him to carry on the Wars in <hi>Gaul. Caeſar</hi> return'd them, and gave each Souldier 250 Drachms. Thoſe who conducted them to <hi>Pompey</hi> ſpread amongſt the People no very favourable report of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and flatter'd <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf with falſe ſuggeſtions that he was wiſh'd for by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army, and though his Affairs here were in an ill poſture thrô the envy of ſome, and the ill ſtate of the Government, yet there the Army was at his Command, and if they might paſs into <hi>Italy,</hi>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:33760:225"/>
would preſently declare for him; ſo uneaſie were they under <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who had engag'd them in ſo many Expeditions, and ſo ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of him as aſpiring to the Monarchy. Upon this <hi>Pompey</hi> grew careleſs, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected all Warlike Preparations as fearing no danger, but attack'd him with Words only and Speeches thinking to conquer by a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of Votes, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſlighted. For 'tis ſaid, that one of his Captains, who was ſent by him to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtanding before the Senate-houſe one day, and being told that the Senate would not give <hi>Caeſar</hi> a longer time in his Government, clapt his Hand on the Hilt of his Sword, and ſaid, <hi>But this ſhall.</hi> Yet the demands which <hi>Caeſar</hi> made had the faireſt colours of Equity imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for he propoſed to lay down his Arms, and that <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould do the ſame, and both together ſhould become private Men, and each expect a Reward of his Services from the Publick; for that thoſe who went to diſarm him, and at the ſame time confirm'd <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Power, only ſuppreſt the one, to eſtabliſh the other in his Tyranny. When <hi>Curio</hi> made theſe Propoſals to the People in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Name, he was mightily applauded, and ſome threw Garlands towards him, and diſmiſt him as they do Wreſtlers, crown'd with Flowers. <hi>Antony</hi> being Tribune, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Letter ſent from <hi>Caeſar</hi> on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:33760:225"/>
and read it, though the Conſuls did what they could to oppoſe it. But <hi>Scipio, Pompey</hi>'s Father-in-Law, propos'd in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that if <hi>Caeſar</hi> did not lay down his Arms within ſuch a time, he ſhould be voted an Enemy; and the Conſuls putting it to the Queſtion, whether <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould diſmiſs his Soldiers; and again, whether <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould disband his, very few aſſented to the firſt, but almoſt all to the latter. But <hi>Antony</hi> propoſing again that both ſhould lay down their Commiſſions, all unanimouſly agreed to it. <hi>Scipio</hi> was upon this very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and <hi>Lentulus</hi> the Conſul cried aloud, that they had need of <hi>Arms,</hi> and not of <hi>Suffrages</hi> againſt a Robber; ſo that they were adjourn'd, and chang'd their Robes in token of grief for the Diſſention. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there came other Letters from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which ſeem'd yet more moderate; for he propoſed to quit every thing elſe, and only to have <hi>Gallia Ciſalpina, Illyricum,</hi> and two Legions, till he ſhould ſtand a ſecond time for Conſul. <hi>Cicero</hi> the Orator, who was lately return'd from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> endeavour'd to reconcile differences, and ſoften'd <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was willing to comply in other things, but not to allow him the Soldiers. At laſt <hi>Cicero</hi> prevail'd with <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Friends, who were now more flexible to accept of the Provinces, and 6000 Soldiers only, and ſo
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:33760:226"/>
to make up the Quarrel. <hi>Pompey</hi> gave way to this, but <hi>Lentulus</hi> the Conſul would not hearken to it, but drove <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Curio</hi> out of the Houſe with diſgrace; by which they afforded <hi>Caeſar</hi> the handſomeſt pretence that could be to enflame the Soldiers, by ſhewing them two Perſons of ſuch Worth and Authority who were forc'd to eſcape in a common Hackney-Coach, in the Habits of Slaves; for ſo they were glad to diſguiſe themſelves, when they fled out of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now there were not about him at that time above 300 Horſe, and 5000 Foot, for the reſt of his Army, which was left behind the <hi>Alps,</hi> was to be brought after him by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Commiſſion'd for that purpoſe. But he thought the firſt Motion towards the deſign which he had then on foot did not require many Forces at preſent, and that he ought to make his firſt ſtep ſo ſuddenly, as to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the adverſe Party into an admiration of his Courage; for he eſteem'd it eaſier to aſtoniſh them, if he came unawares, then fairly to conquer them, if he had alarm'd them by his Preparations; and therefore he commanded his Captains, and other Officers, to go only with their Swords in their Hands without any other Arms, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> a great City of <hi>Gaul,</hi> with as little Noiſe and Bloodſhed as poſſible. He committed the Care of the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:33760:226"/>
Army to <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> and ſpent the day in publick, as a Stander by, and Spectator of the Gladiators, who exercis'd before him. A little before night he bath'd, and then went into the Hall, and converſt for ſome time with thoſe he had invited to Supper, till it began to grow dusky<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he roſe from Table, and having complimented the Company, and deſir'd 'em to ſtay till he came back, gave private Orders to ſome of his Confidents that they ſhould follow him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not all the ſame way; but ſome one way, ſome another. He himſelf got into an Hackney Coach, and drove at firſt another way, but preſently turn'd towards <hi>Arimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> When he came to the River <hi>Rubicon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which parts <hi>Gaul</hi> that is within the <hi>Alps</hi> from the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> his thoughts began to work, now he was juſt entring upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and he waver'd much in his mind, when he conſider'd coolly the difficulty of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. This ſtopt his career for a while, and made him halt, while he revolv'd with himſelf, and often chang'd his Opinion one way; and the other, without ſpeaking a word. When he could not fix his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he diſcuſt the matter very particularly with his Friends which were about him (of which number <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> was one) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting how many Calamities his paſſing that River would bring upon Mankind, and
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:33760:227"/>
what a Relation of it would be tranſmitted to Poſterity. At laſt carried on by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Impulſe he loſt of reaſoning, and truſted to the event, uſing the Proverb fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in their Mouths who enter upon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and bold attempts, <hi>The die is caſt;</hi> with which words he took the River. When he was over, he us'd all expedition poſſible, and before it was day reach'd <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and took it. 'Tis ſaid, that the night before he paſt the River, he had an impious dream that he was unnaturally familiar with his own Mother. As ſoon as <hi>Ariminum</hi> was taken, there was as it were a wide Gate open'd to a War by Sea, as well as Land; and with the limits of the <hi>Provinces,</hi> the boundaries of the <hi>Laws</hi> were tranſgreſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor would one have thought that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants only, as at other times, fled from one place to another in great conſternation, but that the very Towns themſelves left their ſtations, and fled for ſuccor into each other; ſo that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was over run as it were with a Doluge by the conflux of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring People from all parts round about, and was neither eaſie under the Government of its Magiſtrates, nor to be quiered by the Eloquence of any Orator in this great hurry and confuſion, but was in danger of ſinking by its own weight. For contrary paſſions, and violent motions poſſeſt all places; nor
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:33760:227"/>
were thoſe who were intereſted in theſe Changes wholly at peace, but frequently meeting, as in ſo great a City they needs muſt, with ſuch as ſhew'd themſelves fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dejected, brought quarrels on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their great confidence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. <hi>Pompey</hi> ſufficiently of himſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd, was yet more perplex'd by the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of others; ſome telling him that he juſtly ſuffer'd for having arm'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> againſt himſelf, and the Government; others blaming him for permitting <hi>Caeſar</hi> to be inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently us'd by <hi>Lentulus,</hi> when he made ſo large Conceſſions, and offer'd ſuch reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Propoſals towards an Accommodation. <hi>Favonius</hi> bad him now ſtamp upon the Ground; for once talking big in the Senate he deſir'd them not to trouble themſelves about making any preparations for the War; for that he himſelf with one ſtamp of his Foot would fill all <hi>Italy</hi> with Soldiers. Yet ſtill <hi>Pompey</hi> had more Forces then <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but he was not permitted to purſue his own thoughts, but being continually alarm'd with frightful and falſe reports, as if the Enemy was juſt upon him, and Maſter of all, was forc'd to give way, and was born down by the common cry. In this diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it is reſolved to leave the City, and the Senators are commanded to follow him, with an Order, that no one ſhould ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:33760:228"/>
who did not prefer Tyranny to their Countrey, and Liberty. The Conſuls pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fled without making the uſual Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; the ſame did moſt of the Senators, carrying off their own Goods in as much haſt as if they had been robbing their Neighbours. Some, who had formerly much favour'd <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Cauſe, out of fear quitted their own Sentiments, and without any proſpect of good to themſelves, were carried along by the common ſtream. It was a very melancholy view to ſee the City toſt in theſe Tumults like a Ship whoſe Pilot has given her over, and deſpairs of hindring her from being ſtruck on the next Rock. Thoſe, who left the City, though their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture was on ſo ſad an occaſion, yet eſteem'd the place of their Exile to be their Countrey for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ſake, and fled from <hi>Rome,</hi> as if it had been <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Camp. At the ſame time <hi>Labienus,</hi> a Perſon who had been one of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s beſt Friends, and his Lieutenant, and one who had fought by him very vigorouſly in the <hi>Gallic</hi> Wars, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted him, and went over to <hi>Pompey. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> ſent all his Money, and Equipage after him, and then ſat down before <hi>Corfinium,</hi> which was Gariſon'd with 30 Soldiers under the command of <hi>Domitius.</hi> He in deſpair order'd a Phyſician who attended him to give him Poiſon, and taking the Doſe drunk
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:33760:228"/>
it in hopes of being diſpatch'd by it, but ſoon after when he was told that <hi>Caeſar</hi> us'd a wonderful Clemency towards thoſe he took Priſoners, lamented his misfortune, and blam'd the haſtineſs of his own Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. His Phyſician comforted him, when he acquainted him that he had took a ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not a mortal Poiſon; with this he was very much pleaſed, and riſing from his Bed, went preſently over to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and kiſt his Hand, but afterwards revolted to <hi>Pompey.</hi> The report of theſe things at <hi>Rome</hi> ſweetned thoſe who were there, and ſome who had fled thence, return'd. <hi>Caeſar</hi> took into his Army <hi>Domitius</hi>'s Soldiers, as he did all thoſe, whom he found in any Town liſted for <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s Service. Being now ſtrong and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable enough, he advanc'd againſt <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf, who did not ſtay to receive him, but fled to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> having ſent the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls before with the Army to <hi>Dyrrachium.</hi> Soon after upon <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s approach he ſet to Sea, as ſhall be more particularly related in his Life. <hi>Caeſar</hi> would have immediately purſu'd him, but wanted Shipping, and therefore went back to <hi>Rome,</hi> having made himſelf Maſter of all <hi>Italy</hi> in the ſpace of 60 days. When he came thither he found the City more quiet then he expected, and many Senators upon the place, to whom he addreſt himſelf with great courteſie and
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:33760:229"/>
deference, deſiring them to ſend to <hi>Pompey</hi> about any reaſonable Accommodations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Peace. But no body complied with this Propoſal, whether out of fear of <hi>Pompey,</hi> whom they had deſerted, or that they thought <hi>Caeſar</hi> did not mean what he ſaid, but thought it his intereſt to talk plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly. Afterwards, when <hi>Metellus</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune would have hinder'd him from taking Money out of the publick Treaſury, and produc'd ſome Laws againſt it, <hi>Caeſar</hi> replied, That <hi>Arms and Laws did not well agree, and if you are diſpleas'd with what I do, at preſent, Sir, retreat quietly, for War doth not admit long Speeches: When I have laid down my Arms, and entred into Terms of Peace, then come, and Harangue as you pleaſe: and this I tell you in diminution of my own juſt Right, for indeed you are my Subject, as are all thoſe who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd againſt me, and are now in my power.</hi> Having ſaid this to <hi>Metellus,</hi> he went to the Doors of the Treaſury, and the Keys being not to be found, ſent for Smiths to force them open. <hi>Metellus</hi> again making reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ſome encouraging him in it, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> threatned to kill him, if he gave him any farther diſturbance; <hi>And this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you know, young Man, is harder for me to ſay, then to do.</hi> Theſe words made <hi>Metellus</hi> withdraw for fear, and at the ſame time gave way to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s being eaſily and readily ſupplied with
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:33760:229"/>
all things neceſſary for the War. He was now going to make War in <hi>Spain,</hi> with a Reſolution firſt, to remove <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Varro, Pompey</hi>'s Lieutenants, and to make himſelf Maſter of the Army and Provinces under them, that he might more ſecurely advance againſt <hi>Pompey,</hi> when he had no Enemy left behind him. In this Expedition his Perſon was often in danger from Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcades, and his Army by want of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet he did not deſiſt from purſuing the Enemy, provoking them to fight, and beſieging them, till by main force he made himſelf Maſter of their Camps, and their Forces: Only the Officers got off and fled to <hi>Pompey.</hi> When <hi>Caeſar</hi> came back to <hi>Rome, Piſo</hi> his Father in Law advis'd him to ſend Men to <hi>Pompey,</hi> to treat of a Peace; but <hi>Iſauricus</hi> to ingratiate himſelf with <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpoke againſt it. <hi>Caeſar</hi> after this, being choſe <hi>Dictator</hi> by the Senate, called home the Exiles, advanced to Titles of Honour the Children of ſuch as had ſuffer'd under <hi>Sylla,</hi> and ſuch as were in debt by retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome part of the Intereſt, and touch'd upon ſome other Regulations like theſe, but not many: For within 11 days he reſign'd his Dictatorſhip, and having declar'd himſelf Conſul with <hi>Servilius Iſauricus,</hi> made haſte to the Camp again. He march'd ſo faſt, that he left all his Army behind him, except 600
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:33760:230"/>
choſen Horſe, and 5 Legions, with which he put to Sea in the very middle of Winter about the beginning of the Month <hi>January,</hi> which the <hi>Athenians</hi> call <hi>Poſideon,</hi> and having paſt the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea took <hi>Oricum,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonia,</hi> and then ſent back the Ships to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> to bring over the Soldiers, that were left behind in the march. Theſe Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as they were upon the Road, being very much waſted in their Bodies, and tir'd with the fatigue of ſo many Engagements, talkt againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> after this manner. <hi>When at laſt, and where will this</hi> Caeſar <hi>let us be quiet? He carries us from place to place, and uſes us, as if we were not to be worn out, and had no ſenſe of labour. Even our Iron it ſelf is ſpent by blows, and we ought to have ſome pity on our Bucklers, and Breaſt-plates, which have been us'd ſo long. Doth not</hi> Caeſar <hi>gather from our wounds, that we are mortal Men, whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and that we are ſubject to the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, and Diſeaſes, as other Mortals are. 'Tis impoſſible for a God himſelf to force the Winter-Seaſon, or to hinder the Storms, when they rage: Yet he puſhes forward, as if he were not purſuing, but flying from an Enemy.</hi> This was their Diſcourſe as they march'd leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards <hi>Brunduſium.</hi> But when they came thither, and found that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was gone off before them, they chang'd their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and blam'd themſelves as Traitors
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:33760:230"/>
to their General. They now rail'd at their Officers for marching ſo ſlowly, and placing themſelves on the Promontories by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over-againſt <hi>Epirus,</hi> lookt out to ſee if they could eſpy the Veſſels, which were to tranſport them to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> He in the mean time was poſted in <hi>Apollonia,</hi> but had not an Army with him able to fight the Enemy, the Forces from <hi>Brunduſium</hi> being ſo long a coming, which put him into a great ſuſpence, and loſs what to do. At laſt he entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a dangerous project, which was to go in a Veſſel of 12 Oars, without any ones knowledge, over to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> though the Sea was at that time cover'd with a vaſt Fleet of the Enemies. He embark'd in the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the habit of a Slave, and throwing himſelf down like ſome inconſiderable Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, lay along at the bottom of the Veſſel. The River <hi>Anius</hi> was to carry them down to Sea, and there us'd to blow a gentle gale every morning from the Land, which made it very calm towards the mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by driving the Waves forward; but that night there blew a ſtrong Wind from the Sea, which overpower'd that from the Land; ſo that betwixt the violence of the Tide, and the reſiſtance of the Waves againſt it, the River was very rough, and ſo uneven and dangerous, that the Pilot could not make good his Paſſage, but order'd his Sailors to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:33760:231"/>
tack about. <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon this diſcovers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and taking the Pilot by the Hand, who was ſurpriſed to ſee him there, ſaid, <hi>Go on boldly my Friend, and fear nothing; thou carrieſt</hi> Caeſar, <hi>and his Fortune along with thee.</hi> The Mariners when they heard that, forgot the Storm, and laying all their Strength to their Oars, did what they could to force their way down the River. But when it was to no purpoſe, and the Veſſel now took in much Water, <hi>Caeſar</hi> finding himſelf in ſo great danger in the very mouth of the River, permitted the Maſter, though much againſt his will, to turn back. When he was come to Land, his Soldiers ran to him in whole Troops, and expreſt how much they were troubled, that he ſhould think himſelf not ſtrong enough to get a Victory by their ſole Aſſiſtance, but muſt needs diſturb him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and expoſe his Perſon for thoſe who were abſent, as if he could not truſt thoſe who were with him. After this, <hi>Antony</hi> came over with the Forces from <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> which encourag'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> to give <hi>Pompey</hi> Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, though he was encamp'd very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly, and furniſh'd with plenty of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions both by Sea, and Land, whilſt he himſelf, who at firſt had been but ill ſtock'd, was now at laſt extreamly pinch'd for want of Neceſſaries, ſo that his Soldiers were forc'd to dig up a kind of Root which grew
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:33760:231"/>
there, and tempering it with Milk to feed on it. Sometimes they made Loaves, and in their Incurſions on the Enemies Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards, would throw in thoſe Loaves, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that <hi>as long as the Earth produc'd ſuch Roots they would not leave off to beſiege</hi> Pompey. But <hi>Pompey</hi> took what care he could, that neither the Loaves, nor the Words ſhould reach his Men, for they would have been diſheartned at the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hardineſs of their Enemies, and look'd upon them as a Kin to the ſavage Nature of Wild Beaſts. There were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Skirmiſhes about <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Out-works, in all which <hi>Caeſar</hi> had the better, except one; when his Men were forc'd to fly in ſuch a manner, that he had like to have loſt his Camp. For <hi>Pompey</hi> made ſuch a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sally on them, that not a Man ſtood his ground; the Trenches were fill'd with dead Bodies; many fell upon their own Ramparts, and Bulwarks, being cloſely purſu'd by the Enemy. <hi>Caeſar</hi> met them, and would have turn'd them back, but could not. When he went to lay hold of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, thoſe who carried them threw them down, ſo that the Enemies took 32 of them. He himſelf narrowly eſcap'd; for taking hold of a big luſty Fellow that was flying by him, he bad him ſtand, and face about; but the Fellow full of apprehenſions from
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:33760:232"/>
the danger he was in, began to handle his Sword, as if he would ſtrike <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and had done it, had not <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Arm-bearer prevented the blow by chopping off the Man's Arm. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Affairs were ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate at that time, that when <hi>Pompey</hi> either through fear, or his ill Fortune, did not give the finiſhing ſtroke to that great Action, but retreated after he had ſhut up the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my within their Camp, <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſaid to his Friends, <hi>The Victory to day had been on our Enemies ſide, if they had had a General, which knew how to conquer.</hi> When he was retir'd into his Tent, he laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down to ſleep, but ſpent that night the moſt melancholy that he ever did any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perplex'd in his thoughts for his ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in this War; for when he had a large Country before him, and all the wealthy Cities of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> he had neglected to carry the War thither, and had ſat down by the Sea-ſide, whilſt his Enemies had ſuch a powerful Fleet; ſo that he ſeem'd rather to be beſieg'd with want of Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then to beſiege others with his Arms. Being thus diſtracted in his thoughts with the view of the ill poſture he ſtood in, he rais'd his Camp with a deſign to advance towards <hi>Scipio,</hi> who lay in <hi>Macedonia;</hi> for he hop'd either to draw <hi>Pompey</hi> where he ſhould fight without the advantage he now
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:33760:232"/>
had of ſupplies from the Sea, or over-power <hi>Scipio,</hi> if not aſſiſted. This animated <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s Army, and Officers ſo far, that they were for purſuing <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as one that was worſted and flying. But <hi>Pompey</hi> was afraid to hazard a Battle, on which ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and being himſelf provided with all Neceſſaries for a conſiderable time, thought to tire out, and waſte the vigor of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army, which could not laſt long; For the beſt part of his Men, though they had much Experience, and ſhew'd an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible Courage in all Engagements, yet by their frequent marches, changing their Camps, aſſaulting of Towns, and long watches, were ſo broken, and ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted with Age, that their Bodies were unfit for Labour, and their Courage cool'd by their years. Beſides, 'tis ſaid that a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential Diſeaſe occaſioned by their irregular Diet rag'd in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Army, and, what was of greateſt moment, he was neither fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd with Money, nor Proviſions, ſo that in a little time he muſt needs fall of himſelf. For theſe Reaſons <hi>Pompey</hi> had no mind to fight him, and was thank'd for it by none but <hi>Cato,</hi> who was pleas'd with it out of his zeal to preſerve his Fellow-Citizens. For when he ſaw the dead Bodies of thoſe which had faln in the laſt Battle on <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſide to the number of a thouſand, he went away,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:33760:233"/>
cover'd his Face, and wept. The reſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd <hi>Pompey</hi> for declining to fight, and call'd him <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> and the King of Kings, as One that had no mind to lay down his Sovereign Authority, but was pleas'd to ſee ſo many great Commanders attending on him, and paying their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance at his Tent. <hi>Favonius,</hi> who affected <hi>Cato</hi>'s free way of ſpeaking his mind, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd bitterly, that they ſhould eat no Figs that year at <hi>Tuſculum</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ambition to be Monarch. <hi>Afranius,</hi> who was lately return'd out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and by reaſon of the ill Campagne he had made, was ſuſpected by <hi>Pompey</hi> to have betray'd the Army for Money, ask'd him, <hi>Why he did not fight that Merchant, who had made ſuch purchaſes? Pompey</hi> was compell'd by this kind of Language to give <hi>Caeſar</hi> Battle, though againſt his own Sentiments, and in order to it, purſu'd him. <hi>Caeſar</hi> had found great difficulties in his march; for no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try would ſupply him with Proviſions, his Reputation being very much ſunk ſince his laſt Defeat. But when he came to <hi>Gomphi,</hi> a Town of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> he not only found Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for his Army, but Phyſick too. For there they met with plenty of Wine, which they took off very freely; heated with this, and fir'd with the God, they jollily danc'd along, and ſo ſhook off their Diſeaſe, and
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:33760:233"/>
chang'd their whole Conſtitution. When the two Armies were come into <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> and both encamp'd there, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s thoughts ran the ſame way, as they had done before, againſt fighting, and the more, becauſe of ſome unlucky Preſages, and an odd Viſion he had in a Dream. Yet ſome who were about him were ſo confident of ſucceſs, that <hi>Domitius, Spinther,</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> as if they had already conquer'd, quarrel'd which ſhould ſucceed <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Pontificate; And many ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to take Houſes fit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate Conſuls and Praetors, as being ſure of entring upon thoſe Offices, as ſoon as the Battle was over. The Cavalry eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially were eager to fight, as being well Arm'd, and bravely mounted, and valuing themſelves upon the clean ſhapes of their Horſes, and the advantage of their numbers, for they were 5000 againſt 1000 of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s. Nor was their Infantry better match'd, there being 45000 of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, againſt 22000 of the Enemy. <hi>Caeſar</hi> drew up his Soldiers, and told 'em that <hi>Cornificius</hi> was coming up to them with two Legions, and that 15 Companies more under <hi>Calenu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When he ſacrific'd to the Gods for the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Army, upon the death of the firſt Victim, the Augur told him, within 3 days, he ſhould come to a deciſive Action. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ask'd him, <hi>Whether he ſaw any thing in the Entrails, which promis'd an happy Event? That,</hi> ſaith the Prieſt, <hi>you can beſt anſwer your ſelf; for the Gods ſignifie a great Alteration from the preſent poſture of Affairs; if therefore you think your ſelf happy now, expect worſe Fortune; if unhappy, hope for better.</hi> The night before the Battle, as he walk'd the Rounds about Midnight, he ſaw a Light in the Heaven very bright and flaming, which ſeem'd to paſs over <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Camp, and fall into <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s; and when <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Soldiers came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Watch in the morning, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a Panic fear among the Enemies. However he did not expect to fight that day, but decamp'd as if he deſign'd to march towards <hi>Scotuſa.</hi> But when the Tents were taken down, his Scouts rode up to him, and told him the Enemy would give him Battle. With this he was very much pleas'd, and having perform'd his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Gods, ſet his Army in Battalia, dividing them into 3 Bodies. Over the middle-moſt he plac'd <hi>Domitius-Calvinus: Antony</hi> commanded the Left Wing, and he himſelf the Right, being reſolv'd to fight at the Head of the 10th Legion. But when
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:33760:234"/>
he ſaw the Enemies Cavalry planted againſt him, being ſtruck with their Bravery, and their Number, he gave private Orders, That ſix Companies from the Reer of the Army ſhould advance up to him, whom he poſted behind the Right Wing, and inſtructed them what they ſhould do, when the Enemies Horſe came to charge. On the other ſide, <hi>Pompey</hi> commanded the Right Wing, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the Left, and <hi>Scipio, Pompey</hi>'s Father-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law, the Main Body. The whole Weight of the Cavalry was in the Left Wing, who deſign'd to attack the Right Wing of the Enemy, and preſs that part moſt which the General himſelf commanded: For they thought no Body of Foot could be ſo deep as to bear ſuch a ſhock, but that they muſt neceſſarily be broken to pieces upon the firſt impreſſion of ſo ſtrong a Cavalry. When they were ready on both ſides to give the ſignal for Battel, <hi>Pompey</hi> commanded his Foot, who were in the Front, to ſtand their ground, and, without breaking their Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> receive quietly the Enemies firſt Attack, till they came within Javelins caſt. <hi>Caeſar</hi> blam'd this Conduct, and ſaid, <hi>Pompey</hi> was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that the firſt Charge, if it were brisk and fierce, gave weight to every ſtroke, and rais'd a general warmth of Soul, which was eaſily kept alive and improv'd by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the whole Army.

with his Forces, and juſt upon Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he found one of his Captains, a truſty and experienc'd Soldier, encouraging his Men to exert their utmoſt. <hi>Caeſar</hi> call'd him by his Name, and ſaid, <hi>What hopes,</hi> C. Craſſinius, <hi>and what grounds for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Craſſinius</hi> ſtretch'd out his hand, and cried in a loud Voice: <hi>We ſhall conquer nobly,</hi> Caeſar; <hi>and this day I'll deſerve your Praiſes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alive or dead.</hi> With theſe words he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ran in upon the Enemy, back'd only with ſix-ſcore Men, and preſently cut down the foremoſt, and ſtill preſs'd on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with much ſlaughter of the Enemy, till at laſt he was ſtruck back by the Wound of a Sword, which went in at his Mouth with ſuch force, that it came out at his Neck behind. Whilſt the Foot were thus ſharply engag'd in the Main Battel, one Wing of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Horſe march'd up confidently, and open'd their Ranks very wide, that they might ſurround the Right Wing of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> But before they engag'd, ſome Companies of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s made up to them, and did not dart their Javelins at a diſtance, nor ſtrike at their Thighs and Legs as they us'd to do in cloſe Battel, but aim'd at their Faces; for thus <hi>Caeſar</hi> had inſtructed them, in hopes that Young Gentlemen, who had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd much in Battels and Wounds, but were in the flower of their Age, and height
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:33760:235"/>
of their Beauty, would be very apprehenſive of ſuch Blows, and not care for hazarding both a Danger at preſent, and a Blemiſh for the future. This Deſign took, for they were ſo far from bearing the ſtroke of the Javelins, that they could not ſtand the ſight of them, but turn'd about, and cover'd their Faces to ſecure them. In this great diſorder, they were at laſt forc'd to fly for it, and by this Confuſion ruin'd all; for thoſe who had beat them back, preſently ſurrounded the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and falling on their Reer, cut them to pieces. <hi>Pompey,</hi> who commanded the other Wing of the Army, when he ſaw his Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thus broke and flying, was no longer himſelf, nor did he now remember that he was <hi>Pompey the Great;</hi> but like one whom the Gods had depriv'd of his Senſes, and ſtruck with ſome fatal Blow, retir'd to his Tent without ſpeaking a word, and there ſat to expect the Event, till the whole Army was defeated, and the Enemy appear'd upon the Works which were thrown up before his Camp, where they cloſely engag'd with his Men, who were poſted there to defend it. Then he firſt ſeem'd to have recover'd his ſenſes; and when he had ſaid to himſelf, <hi>What, into my Camp too?</hi> he laid aſide his General's habit, and putting on ſuch Cloaths as might beſt favour his flight, ſtole off. What Fortune he met with afterwards, how
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:33760:236"/>
he took ſhelter in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and was murder'd there, we tell you in his Life. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when he came to view <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Camp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaw ſome of his Enemies dead upon the ground, others dying, ſaid with a ſigh, ---- <hi>This they would have; they brought me to this neceſſity, that I</hi> Caius Caeſar <hi>muſt have loſt the credit of all my former Succeſſes in War, if I had at laſt diſmiſs'd my Army. Aſinius Pollio</hi> ſays that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſpoke thoſe words then in <hi>Latin,</hi> which he afterwards wrote in <hi>Greek;</hi> that thoſe who were killed at the taking of the Camp, were moſt of them Servants; and that there fell not above 6000 Soldiers. <hi>Caeſar</hi> incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated moſt of the Foot, whom he took Priſoners, with his own Legions, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſeveral Perſons of Quality, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt <hi>Brutus,</hi> who afterwards ſtabb'd him. He did not immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear after the Battel was over, which put <hi>Caeſar</hi> into a great Agony for him; nor was his pleaſure leſs, when he ſaw him ſafe, and at the ſame time coming over to him. There were many Prodigies that foretold this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; but the moſt ſignal was that at <hi>Tralles.</hi> In the Temple of Victory there ſtood <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Statue; the Floor it ſelf was very firm, and the Stone with which it was pav'd ſtill harder: yet it is ſaid that a Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Tree ſhot it ſelf up near the Pedeſtal of this Statue. In the City of <hi>Padua,</hi> one <hi>C. Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
               <pb n="453" facs="tcp:33760:236"/>
who had the Character of a good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur, fellow-Citizen and Friend of <hi>Livie</hi> the Hiſtorian, happened to make ſome Augural Obſervations that very day when the Battel was fought: And firſt, as <hi>Livie</hi> tells us, he pointed out the critical time of the Fight, and ſaid to thoſe who were by him, That juſt then the Action was hot, and the Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd. When he look'd a ſecond time upon the Birds, and nicely obſerv'd the Omens, he leap'd as if he had been inſpir'd, and cry'd out, <hi>Thou,</hi> Caeſar, <hi>art the Conqueror.</hi> This mightily ſurpriz'd the ſtanders by; but he took the Crown, which he had on, from his Head, and ſwore he would never wear it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain till the Event ſhould give Authority to his Art. This <hi>Livie</hi> poſitively affirms for a Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as a Monument of his Victory, gave the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> great Immunities, and then went in purſuit of <hi>Pompey.</hi> When he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Aſia,</hi> to gratifie <hi>Theopompus,</hi> who had made a Collection of <hi>Fatles,</hi> he enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis'd the <hi>Guidians,</hi> and remitted one third of the Tax to all the <hi>Aſiatics.</hi> When he came to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where <hi>Pompey</hi> was already murder'd, he would not look upon <hi>Theodotus,</hi> who preſented him with his head, but took his Signet and wept over it. Thoſe of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Friends who had been taken by the King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> as they were ſtragling in thoſe parts,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:33760:237"/>
he obliged, and made his own. He wrote Letters to <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein he ſignified to his Friends, That the greateſt Advantage and Pleaſure he found by the Victory was, that he every day ſav'd ſeveral Citizens Lives who had fought againſt him. As to the War in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſome ſay it was dangerous and diſhonourable, and no ways neceſſary, but occaſion'd only by his Paſſion for <hi>Cleopatra:</hi> Others blame the Miniſters, and eſpecially the Eunuch <hi>Photinus,</hi> who was chief Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, had lately took off <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Head, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed <hi>Cleopatra</hi> from Court, and was now thought to be privately carrying on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> to prevent which, <hi>Caeſar</hi> from that time began to ſit up whole nights, under pretence of Drinking, for the greater ſecurity of his Perſon. 'Tis certain, that he was intolerable in his open Affronts to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> both by his Words and Actions; for when <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Soldiers had muſty and unwholſom Corn meaſur'd out to them, <hi>Photinus</hi> told them, They muſt like it, ſince they were fed at another's Coſt. He order'd that his Table ſhould be ſerv'd with wooden and earthen Diſhes, and ſaid, <hi>Caeſar</hi> had carried off all the Gold and Silver Plate, under pretence of Arrears of Debt. For the preſent King's Father ow'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> 1750 Myriads of Money; <hi>Caeſar</hi> had formerly remitted to his Children the reſt, but thought fit to demand the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:33760:237"/>
Myriads at that time, to maintain his Army. <hi>Photinus</hi> told him, That he had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter go then, and attend his other Affairs of greater Conſequence, and that he ſhould receive his Money at another time with Thanks. <hi>Caeſar</hi> replied, That he did not want <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to be his Councellors, and ſoon after privately ſent for <hi>Cleopatra</hi> from her Retirement. She took a little Skiff, and one of her Confidents, <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> along with her, and in the dusk of the evening landed near the Palace. She was at a loſs how to get in undiſcover'd, till ſhe thought of putting her ſelf into the Coverlet of a Bed, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at length, whilſt <hi>Apollodorus</hi> bound up the Bedding, and carried it on his Back through the Caſtle-gates to <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> was firſt taken with this fetch of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> as an Argument of her Wit; and was afterwards ſo far charm'd with her Converſation and graceful Behaviour, that he reconcil'd her to her Brother, and made her Partner in the Government. A Feſtival was kept for joy of this Reconciliation, where <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Barber, a buſie pragmatical Fellow, whoſe fear made him inqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every thing, diſcover'd that there was a Plot carrying on againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> by <hi>Achillas,</hi> General of the King's Forces, and <hi>Photinus</hi> the Eunuch. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> upon the firſt intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of it, ſet a Guard upon the Hall where
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:33760:238"/>
the Feaſt was kept, and kill'd <hi>Photinus. Achillas</hi> eſcap'd to the Army, and rais'd a troubleſom War againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which it was not eaſie for him to manage with ſo ſmall a Force againſt ſo powerful a State. The firſt difficulty he met with, was want of Water; for the Enemies had turned the Pipes. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, that when the Enemy endeavour'd to cut off his Communication by Sea, he was forc'd to divert that Danger by ſetting fire to his own Ships, which when it had burnt the Harbor, ſpread it ſelf ſo far as to deſtroy the famous Library of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> A third was, that in an Engagement near <hi>Pharos</hi> he leap'd from the Mole into a Skiff, to aſſiſt his Soldiers, who were in danger: When the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> preſs'd him on every ſide, he threw himſelf into the Sea, and with much difficulty ſwam off. He had then many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in his hand, which though he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually darted at, and forc'd to keep his Head often under Water, yet he did not let go, but held them up ſafe from wetting in one hand, whilſt he ſwam with the other. His Skiff in the mean time was quickly ſunk. At laſt, the King having got off to <hi>Achillas</hi> and his Party, <hi>Caeſar</hi> engag'd and conquer'd them; many fell in that Battel, and the King himſelf was never ſeen after. Upon this, he makes <hi>Cleopatra</hi> Queen of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who ſoon after had a Son by him, whom the <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drians</hi>
               <pb n="457" facs="tcp:33760:238"/>
call'd <hi>Caeſarion,</hi> and then departed for <hi>Syria.</hi> Thence he paſſed to <hi>Aſia,</hi> where he heard that <hi>Domitius</hi> was beaten by <hi>Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> Son of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and fled out of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> with an handful of Men; and that <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi> purſu'd the Victory ſo eagerly, that though he was already Maſter of <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> he had ſtill farther aims to take in <hi>Armenia</hi> the leſs; in order to which, he invited all the Kings and Tetrarchs there to riſe. <hi>Caeſar</hi> immediately marched againſt him with three Legions, fought him near <hi>Zela,</hi> drove him out of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and totally defeated his Army. When he gave <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> a Friend of his at <hi>Rome,</hi> an Account of this Action, to expreſs the ſmartneſs and diſpatch of it, he uſed theſe three words, <hi>Veni, Vidi, Vici;</hi> which <hi>Latin</hi> words having all the ſame Cadence, carry with them an air of brevity, which in this place is very lucky and graceful. Hence he went for <hi>Italy,</hi> and came to <hi>Rome</hi> at the end of that Year, for which he was a ſecond time choſe Dictator, (though that Office had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laſted ſo long) and was elected Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul for the next. He was ill ſpoke of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe upon a Mutiny of Soldiers, who kill'd <hi>Coſconius</hi> and <hi>Galba,</hi> who had been Praetors, he gave them only that ſlight Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand of calling them <hi>Citizens,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Fellow-Soldiers,</hi> and after gave each Man
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:33760:239"/>
a thouſand Drachms, beſides a ſhare of ſome Lands in <hi>Italy.</hi> He was alſo reflected on for <hi>Dolabella</hi>'s Extravagance, <hi>Amintius</hi>'s Covetouſneſs, <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and <hi>Corfinius</hi>'s Profuſeneſs, who pull'd down <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Houſe, and re-built it, as not Magnificent enough; for the <hi>Romans</hi> were much diſpleaſed with all theſe. But <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for the carrying on his Deſigns, though he knew their Characters, and diſapprov'd them, was forc'd to make uſe of ſuch Inſtruments. After the Battel of <hi>Pharſalia, Cato</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> fled into <hi>Afric,</hi> and there, with the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of King <hi>Juba,</hi> got together a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Force, which <hi>Caeſar</hi> reſolv'd to engage. In order to it, he paſs'd into <hi>Sicily</hi> in the very midſt of Winter; and to remove from his Officers all hopes of delay there, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd by the Sea-ſhoar, and as ſoon as ever he had a fair Wind put to Sea with 3000 Foot, and a few Horſe. When he had land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, he went back privately under great apprehenſions for the better part of his Army; but met 'em upon the Sea, and brought them all to the ſame Camp. There he was inform'd, That the Enemies rely'd much upon an ancient Oracle, That the Family of the <hi>Scipioes</hi> ſhould be always Victorious in <hi>Afric.</hi> There was in his Army a Fellow, otherwiſe mean and contemptible, but of the Houſe of the <hi>Africani,</hi> and his Name
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:33760:239"/>
               <hi>Scipio Salluſtio:</hi> This Man <hi>Caeſar</hi> put in the Head of his Army, with the Title of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; which he did either in raillery to ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule <hi>Scipio,</hi> who commanded the Enemy, or ſeriouſly to bring over the Omen to his ſide. He was oblig'd often to ſet upon the Ememy, and skirmiſh with them; for he wanted both Victualling for his Men, and Forage for his Horſe: ſo that he was forc'd to feed 'em with a Sea-weed, which he mix'd with Graſs, to take off its ſaltneſs, and to give it a more agreeable Taſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was forc'd to make this ſhift, becauſe the <hi>Numidians,</hi> in great Numbers, and well Hors'd, commanded the Country. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Cavalry being one day out of Employ, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted themſelves with ſeeing an <hi>African,</hi> who entertain'd 'em with a Dance, and play'd upon the Pipe to admiration: They were ſo taken with this, that they lighted, and gave their Horſes to ſome Boys, when on a ſudden the Enemy briskly ſurrounded them, kill'd ſome, purſu'd the reſt, and fell in with 'em into their Camp; and had not <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf and <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> came in to their Aſſiſtance, and put a ſtop to their flight, the War had been then at an end. In another Engagement, where the Enemy had again the better, <hi>Caeſar</hi> took an Enſign, who was running away, by the Neck, and forcing him to face about, ſaid, <hi>Look, that</hi>
               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:33760:240"/>
               <hi>way is the Enemy! Scipio</hi> fluſh'd with this Succeſs at firſt, had a mind to come to one deciſive Action. Wherefore he leaves <hi>Afra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Juba</hi> in two diſtinct Bodies not far diſtant, and marches himſelf towards <hi>Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſacus,</hi> where he built a Fort, which might ſerve for a Security to them, and a Retreat to himſelf. Whilſt <hi>Scipio</hi> was taken up with this matter, <hi>Caeſar</hi> with an incredible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch made his way through thick Woods, and an unpaſſable Country, ſurrounded one Party of the Enemy, and charg'd the other other in the Front. When he had defeated theſe, he improv'd this Opportunity, and the courſe of his good Fortune ſo far, that in one moment he took <hi>Afranius</hi>'s Camp, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd that of the <hi>Numidians, Juba</hi> their King being glad to ſave himſelf by flight; ſo that in a ſmall part of a day he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of three Camps, and kill'd 50000 of the Enemy, with the loſs only of 50 Men. This is the Account ſome give of that Fight; Others ſay, He was not in the Action, but that he was taken with his uſual Diſtemper juſt as he was ſetting his Army in Battalia. He perceiv'd the approaches of it, before it had too far diſorder'd his Senſes; and as ſoon as he began to ſhake, took care to be remov'd into a neighbouring Fort, where he repos'd himſelf. Of the Great Men that were taken after the Fight, ſome <hi>Caeſar</hi> put
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:33760:240"/>
to Death, others prevented him by killing themſelves. <hi>Cato</hi> had undertaken to defend <hi>Utica,</hi> and for that reaſon was not in the Battel. The deſire which <hi>Caeſar</hi> had to take him alive, made him haſten thither; upon notice that he had diſpatch'd himſelf, 'tis certain <hi>Caeſar</hi> was much diſcompos'd, but for what reaſon is not ſo well agreed: yet this he ſaid; <hi>Cato, I envy thee thy Death, becauſe thou enviedſt me the honour of ſaving thy Life.</hi> Yet after all this, the Diſcourſe he wrote againſt <hi>Cato</hi> after his Death, is no great ſign of his kindneſs, or that he was thorowly reconciled to him. For how is it probable that he would have been tender of his <hi>Life,</hi> who was ſo bitter againſt his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory?</hi> Yet from his Clemency to <hi>Cicero, Brutus,</hi> and many others who fought againſt him, ſome have gueſs'd that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Book was not compos'd ſo much out of harted to <hi>Cato,</hi> as in his own Vindication. <hi>Cicero,</hi> it ſeems, had written an Encomium upon <hi>Cato,</hi> and call'd it by his Name; a Diſcourſe written by ſo great a Maſter upon ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Subject, was ſure to be in every ones hands. This touch'd <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Panegyric</hi> on his Enemy, as no better then a <hi>Satyr</hi> againſt himſelf: and therefore he made in his <hi>Anti-Cato</hi> a full Collection of whatever could be ſaid in that Great Man's derogation. Thoſe Diſcourſes had
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:33760:241"/>
each of them their ſeveral Admirers, as Men were differently inclin'd to the Parties. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> upon his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to entertain the People with a large Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Victory, telling them, That he had ſubdu'd a Country, which would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Publick every year with 200000 Buſhels of Corn, and 3000000 weight of Oyl. He was allow'd three Triumphs, for <hi>Aegypt, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Afrric;</hi> the laſt, not for the Conqueſt of <hi>Scipio,</hi> but <hi>Juba,</hi> whoſe little Son was then led in Triumph, the happieſt Captive that ever was, who of a barbarous <hi>Numidian</hi> came by this means to be reckon'd among the moſt Learned Hiſtorians of all <hi>Greece.</hi> After theſe Triumphs, he diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Rewards to his Soldiers, and treated the People with Feaſting and Shews: At one Feaſt he had 22000 Tables, and entertain'd the People with Gladiators and Sea-Fights in honour to his Daughter <hi>Julia,</hi> long ſince dead. When thoſe Shews were over, an Account was taken of the people, who from 320000 were now reduc'd 150000. So great a waſte had the Civil War made in <hi>Rome</hi> alone, not to mention what the other parts of <hi>Italy</hi> and the Provinces ſuffer'd. He was now choſen a fourth time Conſul, and went into <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Sons; they were but young, yet had got together a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſhew'd they had Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:33760:241"/>
to command it, ſo that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was in extreme danger. The great Battel was near <hi>Munda,</hi> in which <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſeeing his Men hard preſs'd, and making but a weak Reſiſtance, ran through the Ranks among the Soldiers, and crying out, ask'd them, Whether they were not aſham'd to deliver him into the hands of Boys? At laſt, with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the beſt efforts he could make, he forced back the Enemy, killing 30000 of them, though with the loſs of 1000 of his beſt Men. When he came back from the Fight, he told his Friends, that he had often fought for <hi>Victory,</hi> but this was the firſt time he had ever fought for <hi>Life.</hi> This Battel was won on the Feaſt of the <hi>Bacchanals,</hi> the very day in which <hi>Pompey,</hi> four years before, had ſet out for the War. The younger of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Sons eſcap'd, and <hi>Didius</hi> ſome days after the Fight brought the elder's Head to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> This was the laſt Battel he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in. The Triumph he made for this Victory diſpleas'd the <hi>Romans</hi> beyond any thing: For he had not defeated foreign Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, and barbarous Kings, but had ruin'd the Children and Family of one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Men of <hi>Rome,</hi> though unfortunate; and it did not look well to triumph over the Calamities of his Country, and to rejoyce in thoſe things for which no better Apology could be made to the Gods and Men, then
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:33760:242"/>
their being abſolutely neceſſary. Beſides, that hitherto he had never ſent Letter or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of any Victory over his Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but had ſeem'd rather to be aſham'd of the Action, then to expect Honour from it. For all this, the <hi>Romans</hi> taking the ſame ſide with Fortune, gave the Rein into his hands, and hoping that the Government of a ſingle Perſon would give them time to breathe after ſo many Civil Wars and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, made him Dictator for Life. This was a down-right Tyranny; for his Power now was not only <hi>abſolute,</hi> but <hi>perpetual</hi> too. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> propos'd to the Senate to confer ſuch Honours upon him as were indeed in ſome meaſure within the bounds of modeſty; Others ſtriving which ſhould deſerve moſt, carried them ſo exceſſively high, that they made <hi>Caeſar</hi> odious to the moſt indifferent and moderate ſort of men by the haughtineſs and extravagance of thoſe Titles which they decreed him. His <hi>Enemies</hi> are thought to have had ſome ſhare in this, as well as his <hi>Flatterers:</hi> it gave them more advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and laid him more open to their Calumnies, for ſince the Civil Wars were ended, he had nothing elſe that he could be charg'd with. And they had good reaſon to decree a Temple to <hi>Clemency,</hi> in token of their Thanks for this mild uſe he made of this Victory; for he not only pardon'd many
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:33760:242"/>
of thoſe who fought againſt him; but far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſome gave Honours and Offices: as particularly to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> who both of them were Praetors; <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Images that were thrown down, he ſet up again; upon which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, that <hi>by raiſing</hi> Pompey's <hi>Statues he had fix'd his own.</hi> When his Friends advis'd him to a Guard, and ſeveral offer'd their Service, he would not hear of it, but ſaid, It was better to ſuffer Death once; then always to live in fear of it. He look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Affections of the People to be the beſt and ſureſt Guard, and therefore enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd them again with publick Feaſtings and general Diſtributions of Corn; and to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his Army, he ſent out many Colonies to ſeveral places, of which the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able were <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Corinth;</hi> which, as before they had been ruin'd at the ſame time, ſo now they were reſtor'd and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl'd together. As for the Men of Quality, he promis'd ſome that they ſhould be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls</hi> or <hi>Praetors;</hi> others he ſatisfied with Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices or Titles; to all he gave hopes of his Favour, as being deſirons to rule by Love: So that upon the Death of <hi>Maximus,</hi> one day before his Conſulate was ended, he made <hi>Caninius Rebellius</hi> Conſul for that day. When many went to pay their Complements to the new Conſul, as is uſual, <hi>

               <hi>Man be gone out of his Office before we come. Caeſar</hi> was born to do great things, and had a love of Honour; nor did the many Noble Exploits he had done invite him to ſit ſtill, and reap the fruit of his paſt labours, but were Incentives and Encouragements to go on, and rais'd in his Soul the Ideas of ſtill great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Actions, and a deſire of new Glory, as if the preſent were all ſpent. This Paſſion was a kind of aemulous ſtruggle with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as it had been with another, how he might out-do his <hi>paſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Actions by his <hi>future.</hi> In purſuit of theſe thoughts, he reſolv'd to make War upon the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and when he had ſubdu'd them, to paſs through <hi>Hircania;</hi> thence to march along by the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea to Mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and ſo on about <hi>Pontus,</hi> till he came into <hi>Scythia;</hi> then to over-run all the Countries about <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> it ſelf; and to return through <hi>Gaul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> till he had finiſhed the whole Circle of his intended Empire, and bounded it on every ſide by the Ocean. While Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were making for this Expedition, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to dig through the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> on which <hi>Corinth</hi> ſtands. Afterthat, he had a Deſign to divert the Rivers <hi>Apien</hi> and <hi>Tiber,</hi> and to carry them by a deep Channel directly from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Circaeum,</hi> and ſo into the Sea near <hi>Tarracina,</hi> that there might be a ſafe and eaſie Paſſage for all Merchants who tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:33760:243"/>
to <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides this, he intended to drain all the Marſhes by <hi>Nomentum</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> and gain ground enough from the Water to employ many Thouſands of Men in Tillage. He propos'd farther to make great Mounds on the Shoar nigheſt <hi>Rome,</hi> to hinder the Sea from breaking in upon the Land; to cleanſe the <hi>Oſtian</hi> Shoar of ſuch hidden Shelves and Rocks as made it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe for Shipping, and to build Ports and Harbors fit to receive ſuch large Veſſels as uſed to ride thereabouts. Theſe things were deſign'd without taking effect: but his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Kalendar, in order to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the irregularity of Time, was not only ingeniouſly contriv'd, but brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by him, and prov'd of very great uſe; For it was not only in ancient Times that the <hi>Romans</hi> wanted a certain Rule to make the Revolutions of their Months fall in with the Courſe of the Year, (whereby their Feſtivals and ſolemn days for Sacrifice were remov'd by little and little, till at laſt they came to be kept at a Seaſon quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what they had been formerly) but even at this time, the People had no way of computing right the Courſe of the Sun; only the Prieſts had the knack, and at their pleaſure, without giving any notice, clapt in an intercalary Month, which they call'd <hi>Mercedonius. Numa</hi> was the firſt who put in
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:33760:244"/>
this Month, but his Invention was too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſhort to correct all the Errors that roſe from their Computation of the Year, as we have ſhewn in his Life. <hi>Caeſar</hi> call'd in the beſt Philoſophers and Mathematicians of his Time, to ſettle this Point; and upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples there propos'd, eſtabliſh'd a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and proper Method of correcting the Kalendar; which the <hi>Romans</hi> uſe to this day, and ſeem to err leſs then any other Nation in the Reduction of this inequality of Months to the Year. Yet even this gave Offence to thoſe who envy'd his Grandeur, and were weary of his Power; for <hi>Cicero</hi> the Orator, when one of the Company chanc'd to ſay, <hi>The next morning</hi> Lyra <hi>would riſe;</hi> reply'd, <hi>Yes, by vertue of the Edict;</hi> as if Men were forc'd by Authority to receive this new Scheme. But that which brought upon him the moſt apparent and mortal hatred, was his affectation of being King, which gave the Common People the firſt Occaſion to quarrel with him, and prov'd the moſt ſpecious pretence to thoſe who had been his ſecret Enemies all along. Thoſe who would have procur'd him that Title, gave it out, That 'twas foretold in the <hi>Sibylls</hi> Books, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould conquer the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> when they fought againſt them under the Conduct of a King, but not before. And one day, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> was going from <hi>Alba</hi> to
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:33760:244"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome were ſo bold as to ſalute him by the Name of King; but he finding the People diſreliſh it, ſeem'd to reſent it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſaid, <hi>His Title was Caeſar, not King.</hi> Upon this, they forbore their Acclamations, and he paſt on with an air that expreſs'd much ſullenneſs and diſſatisfaction. Another time, when the Senate had conferr'd on him ſome extravagant Honours, he chanc'd to receive the Meſſage as he was ſitting on the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> where, though the Conſuls and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors themſelves waited on him, attended by the whole Body of the Senate, he did not riſe, but behav'd himſelf to them as if they had been private Men, and told them, His Honours wanted rather to be retrench'd, than increas'd. This Carriage of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended not only the Senate, but Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty too; for they thought the affront upon the Senate equally reflected upon the whole Republick; ſo that all who could decently leave him went off much dejected. <hi>Caeſar</hi> perceiving the falſe ſtep he had made, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately retir'd home, and laying his Throat bare, told his Friends, That he was ready to ſtand fair for any man that would do him the kind Office: Afterwards he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd his ſitting by his Diſtemper, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that thoſe who are affected with it have their ſenſes diſcompos'd, if they talk much ſtanding; that they preſently grow
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:33760:245"/>
giddy, fall iuto Convulſions, and quite loſe their Reaſon. But all this was feign'd; for he would willingly have ſtood up to the Senate, had not <hi>Cornelius Balbus,</hi> one of his Friends, or rather Flatterers, hinder'd him. <hi>Don't you remember,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you are</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar; <hi>and will you abate any thing of that Honor which is due to your Dignity?</hi> He gave ſtill a freſh occaſion of reſentment by his affront to the Tribunes. The <hi>Lupercalia</hi> were then ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, a Feaſt at the firſt Inſtitution pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, as ſome Writers ſay, to the Shepherds, much of the ſame nature with the <hi>Arcadian Lycaea:</hi> Many young Noblemen and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates run up and down the City naked, ſtriking all they meet with leathern Thongs, by way of ſport; Many Women of the beſt Quality place themſelves in the way, and hold out their Hands to the Laſh, as Boys in a School do to the <hi>Ferula,</hi> out of an Opinion that it procures an eaſie Labour to thoſe who are with Child, and makes thoſe conceive who are barren. <hi>Caeſar</hi> dreſt in a Triumphal Robe, ſeated himſelf in a golden Chair upon the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> to view this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. <hi>Anthony,</hi> as Conſul, was one of thoſe who ran this Courſe; when he came into the <hi>Forum,</hi> the People made way for him, whilſt he preſented <hi>Caeſar</hi> with a Diadem wreath'd with Lawrel. Upon this, there was a ſmall ſhout, made only by thoſe
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:33760:245"/>
few who were planted there for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but when <hi>Caeſar</hi> refus'd it, there was an univerſal applauſe. Upon the ſecond of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, very few; and upon the ſecond refuſal, all again clapp'd. <hi>Caeſar</hi> finding it would not take, roſe up, and order'd the Crown to be carried into the Capitol. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Statues were afterwards found with Royal Diadems on their Heads; <hi>Flavius</hi> and <hi>Marullus,</hi> two Tribunes of the People, went preſently and pull'd them off; and having apprehended thoſe who firſt ſaluted <hi>Caeſar</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them: The People follow'd them with acclamations, and call'd them <hi>Brutus</hi>'s, becauſe <hi>Brutus</hi> was the firſt who cut off the Succeſſion of Kings, and transferr'd the Power which before was lodg'd in <hi>One,</hi> into the hands of the Senate and People. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſo far reſented this, that he diſplac'd <hi>Marullus</hi> and <hi>Flavius;</hi> and as he inveigh'd againſt them, at the ſame time ridicul'd the People, telling them, He confeſs'd thoſe Men were indeed properly call <hi>Bruti</hi> and <hi>Cumaei</hi> [Beaſts and Sots.] This made the Multitude place their hopes on <hi>M. Brutus,</hi> who by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſide was thought to be deſcended from that firſt <hi>Brutus,</hi> and by his Mother's ſide from the <hi>Servilii,</hi> another Noble Family; being beſides Nephew and Son-in-law to <hi>Cato.</hi> But the Honours and Favours he had receiv'd from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> took off the edge from
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:33760:246"/>
thoſe eager Deſires he naturally had to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Monarchy; for he had not only been pardon'd himſelf after <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Defeat at <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> and had procur'd the ſame Grace for many of his Friends, but was one in whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> had a particular Confidence. He had at that time the moſt honourable Praetorſhip of the Year, and was nam'd for the Conſulſhip four years after, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before <hi>Caſſius</hi> his Competitor. Upon the Diſpute between them, <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid, That <hi>Caſſius</hi> had the faireſt Pretenſions, but that he could not paſs by <hi>Brutus.</hi> Nor did he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hearken to thoſe who accus'd <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> as engag'd in a Conſpiracy againſt him; but laying his hand on his Body, ſaid to the Informers, <hi>Brutus will ſtay for this skin of mine;</hi> intimating, that he was worthy of Empire on account of his Vertue, but would not be baſe and ungrateful to gain one. But thoſe who deſir'd a Change, and look'd on Him as the <hi>only,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per perſon</hi> to effect it, durſt not diſcourſe the matter with him, but in the Night-time laid Papers about his Chair of State, where he us'd to ſit and determine Cauſes, with Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in them to this import: <hi>You are aſleep,</hi> Brutus; <hi>you are no longer</hi> Brutus. <hi>Caſſius,</hi> when he perceiv'd his ambitious Soul a little rais'd upon this, was more inſtant then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to work him yet farther, having him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:33760:246"/>
a private grudge againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for ſome Reaſons that we have mention'd in the Life of <hi>Brutus.</hi> Nor was <hi>Caeſar</hi> without ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him, ſo that he took occaſion to ſay to his Friends, <hi>What do you think</hi> Caſſius <hi>drives at? I don't well like him, he looks ſo pale.</hi> And when it was told him that <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labella</hi> were in a Plot againſt him, he ſaid, <hi>He did not fear ſuch fat, jolly Men, but rather the pale, lean Fellows;</hi> meaning <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Brutus.</hi> But neither was his Fate ſo much unexpected, as it was unavoidable; for there were many ſtrange Prodigies and Apparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were Preſages of it. As to the Lights in the Heavens, the Phantoms which walk'd in the Night, and the wild Birds which perch'd upon the <hi>Forum,</hi> theſe are not perhaps worth taking notice of in ſo great a Caſe as this. <hi>Strabo</hi> the Philoſopher tells us, that many as they went along ſeem'd to be all on fire; and that a Soldier's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſeem'd to throw a great quantity of flame out of his hand, ſo that they who ſaw it thought he muſt be burnt, but that after all he had no hurt. As <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſacrificing, the Victim was ſeen to want an Heart, which was a very ill Omen, becauſe a Creature can't ſubſiſt without an Heart. Many add, that a Soothſayer bid him prepare for ſome great Danger on the <hi>Ides of March:</hi> When the day was come, <hi>Caeſar</hi> as he went to the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:33760:247"/>
Senate met this Soothſayer, and ſaid to him by way of raillery, <hi>The Ides of</hi> March <hi>are come;</hi> who anſwer'd him calmly, <hi>Yes, they are come, but they are not paſt.</hi> The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Aſſaſſination, he ſupp'd with <hi>M. Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus;</hi> as he was ſigning ſome Letters, there aroſe a Diſpute what ſort of Death was the beſt? At which he immediately, before any one could ſpeak, ſaid, <hi>A ſudden one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, as he was in Bed with his Wife, all the Doors and Windows of the Houſe flew open together; he was ſtartled at the Noiſe, and the Light which brake into the Room, and ſat up in his Bed, where by the Moon-ſhine he perceived <hi>Calpurnia</hi> faſt aſleep, but heard her utter in her Dream ſome indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct words, and inarticulate groans. She fancied at that time ſhe was weeping over <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and holding him butcher'd in her Arms. Others ſay, This was not her Dream; but that ſhe dreamt a Pinacle (which the Senate had order'd to be rais'd on <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Houſe by way of Ornament and Grandeur) was broken down, which was the occaſion of her tears and groans. When it was day, ſhe begg'd of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> if it were poſſible, not to ſtir ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but to adjourn the Senate to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; and if he ſlighted her Dreams, that he would be pleas'd to conſult his Fate by Sacrifices and other kinds of Divination.
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:33760:247"/>
Nor was he himſelf without ſome ſuſpicion and fears; for he never before diſcover'd in <hi>Calpurnia</hi> any Womaniſh Superſtition, whom he now ſaw under ſuch terrible apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Upon the Report which the Prieſts made to him, that they had kill'd ſeveral Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and ſtill found them inauſpicious, he was reſolv'd to ſend <hi>Anthony</hi> to diſmiſs the Senate. <hi>D. Brutus,</hi> whoſe Sirname was <hi>Albinus,</hi> (one whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> had ſuch confidence in, that he made him his ſecond Heir, thô at the ſame time he was engag'd in the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with the other <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi>) fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, leſt if <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould put off the Senate to another day, the buſineſs might get wind, took care to expoſe the Pretenders to Divination, and blam'd <hi>Caeſar</hi> for giving the Senate ſo juſt Occaſions of quarrelling with him, by caſting ſuch a ſlur on them; for that they were met upon his Summons, and were ready to vote unanimouſly, that he ſhould be declared King of all the Provinces without <hi>Italy,</hi> and might wear a Diademin any other place but <hi>Italy,</hi> by Sea or Land. If any one ſhould be ſent to tell 'em they might break up for the preſent, and meet again when <hi>Calpurnia</hi> ſhould chance to have better Dreams; what would his Enemies ſay? or who could with any patience hear his Friends, if they ſhould pretend to defend his Government as not Arbitrary and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical?
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:33760:248"/>
But if he was poſſeſs'd ſo far as to think this day unfortunate, yet it were more decent to go himſelf to the Senate, and to adjourn it in his own Perſon. <hi>Brutus</hi> as he ſpoke theſe words took <hi>Caeſar</hi> by the hand, and conducted him forth: He was not gone far from the door, when a Servant made towards him; but not being able to come up to him by reaſon of the Crowd who preſs'd about him, he made ſhift to get into the Houſe, and committed himſelf to <hi>Calpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> begging of her to ſecure him till <hi>Caeſar</hi> return'd, becauſe he had matters of great importance to communicate to him. <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midorus,</hi> a <hi>Cnidian,</hi> who taught the Art of Sophiſtry in <hi>Greek,</hi> and by that means was ſo far acquainted with ſome about <hi>Brutus,</hi> that he had got into the Secret, brought <hi>Caeſar</hi> in a little Schedule the Heads of what he had to depoſe. He had obſerv'd that <hi>Caeſar</hi> as he receiv'd any Papers preſently gave 'em to the Servants who attended on him; and therefore came as near to him as he could, and ſaid, <hi>Read this,</hi> Caeſar alone, <hi>and quickly, for it contains great Buſineſs, and ſuch as concerns you. Caeſar</hi> receiv'd it, and went to read it ſeveral times, but was ſtill hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the Crowd of thoſe who came to ſpeak to him. However, he kept it in his hand by it ſelf, till he came into the Senate. Some ſay it was another who gave <hi>Caeſar</hi> this
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:33760:248"/>
Note, and that <hi>Artemidorus</hi> could not get to him, being all along kept off by the Crowd. All theſe things might happen by chance: but the place where the Senate met, which was choſe out for the Scene of this Murther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the ſame in which <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Statue ſtood, and was one of the Edifices which <hi>Pompey</hi> had rais'd and dedicated with his Theatre to the uſe of the Publick; which plainly ſhew'd that there was ſomething of a <hi>Deity</hi> which guided the Action, and order'd it to be in that particular place. <hi>Caſſius</hi> juſt before the Aſſaſſination look'd towards <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and ſilently implor'd his Aſſiſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he was an <hi>Epicurean</hi> in his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: but this Occaſion, and the inſtant Danger, ſhook his former Notions, and made him a perfect Enthuſiaſt. As for <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was firm to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and a luſty Perſon, <hi>Brutus Abinus</hi> kept him without the Houſe, and entertain'd him with a long Diſcourſe contriv'd on purpoſe. When <hi>Caeſar</hi> entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Houſe, the Senate ſtood up in reſpect to him; of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Confederates ſome came about his Chair, and ſtood behind it; others met him, pretending to ſupplicate with <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus Cimber,</hi> in behalf of his Brother who was in Exile; and they follow'd him with their joynt Petitions till he came to his Seat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When he was ſat down, he refus'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their Requeſts, and upon their
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:33760:249"/>
urging him farther, reprimanded them ſeverally: when <hi>Metellus</hi> laying hold of his Robe with both his hands, pull'd it over his Neck, which was the Signal for the Aſſault. <hi>Caſca</hi> gave him the firſt Cut in the Neck, which was not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, nor dangerous, as coming from one who at the beginning of ſuch a bold Action was probably very much diſturb'd. <hi>Caeſar</hi> immediately turn'd about, and laid his Hand upon his Dagger; and both of 'em at the ſame time cry'd out: He that receiv'd the Blow, in <hi>Latine, Wicked</hi> Caſca! <hi>what doſt thou mean?</hi> and he that gave it, in <hi>Greek,</hi> to his Brother, <hi>Brother, help!</hi> Upon the firſt Onſet, thoſe who were not conſcious to the Deſign were aſtoniſh'd; and their Horror at the Action was ſo great, that they durſt not fly, nor aſſiſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> nor as much as ſpeak a word. But thoſe who came prepar'd for the Buſineſs, enclos'd him on every ſide with their naked Daggers in their Hands: Which way ſoever he turn'd, he met with Blows, and ſaw their Swords levell'd at his Face and Eyes, and was baited on all ſides, like a Beaſt taken in a Toyl. For it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed they ſhould each of them make a Thruſt at him, and fleſh themſelves with his Blood; wherefore <hi>Brutus</hi> gave
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:33760:249"/>
him one Stab in the Groin. Some ſay that he fought and reſiſted all the reſt, and mov'd off from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, calling out for Help: But when he ſaw <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Sword<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> drawn, he cover'd his Face with his Robe, and quietly ſurrendred himſelf, till he was puſh'd, either by Chance, or by Deſign of the Murtherers, to the Pedeſtal, on which <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Statue ſtood, which by that means was much ſtain'd with his Blood; ſo that <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf may ſeem to have had his ſhare in the Revenge of his Enemy, who fell at his Feet, and breath'd out his Soul through his mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Wounds; for they ſay he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Three and Twenty. The Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinates themſelves were many of them wounded by each other, whilſt they all levelled their Blows at the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Caeſar</hi> was diſpatch'd, <hi>Brutus</hi> ſtood forth to give a Reaſon for what they had done; but the Senate would not hear him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but flew out of doors in all haſte, and fill'd the People with ſo much Fear and Diſtraction, that ſome ſhut up Houſe, others left their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Shops. All ran one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſome to the Place, to ſee the ſad
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:33760:250"/>
Spectacle; others back again, after they had ſeen it. <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus, Caeſar</hi>'s beſt Friends, got off privately, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded themſelves in ſome Friends Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Followers, being yet hot with the Murther, marched in a Body from the Senate-Houſe to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol with their drawn Swords, not like Perſons who thought of eſcaping, but with an Air of Confidence and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. As they went along, they call'd to the People to reſume their Liberty, and complimented thoſe of better Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which they met. Some of thoſe went along with them, and joyn'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the Conſpirators, pretending to the Honour of the Action, as if they had born a part in it. Of this number was <hi>C.

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:33760:250"/>
expreſſig either any Pleaſure or Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſhewed by their deep ſilence that they pitied <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and reverenc'd <hi>Brutus.</hi> The Senate made Acts of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion for what was paſt, and took hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Meaſures to reconcile all Parties; They order'd that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd as a God, and that not any the leaſt thing ſhould be alter'd which he had enacted during his Government; At the ſame time, they gave <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Followers the Command of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and other conſiderable Poſts: ſo that all People now thought things were well ſettled, and put into a very good Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. But when <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Will was open'd, and it was found that he had left a Conſiderable Legacy to each one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens; and when his Body was ſeen carried through the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Place all mangled with Wounds, the Multitude could no longer contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the Bounds of Decency and Order, but heap'd together a Pile of Benches, Bars, and Tables, which they placed the Corps on, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fire to it, burnt them. Then they took<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firebrands, and ran ſome to fire the Houſes of the Aſſaſſinates, others up and down the City, to find out the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:33760:251"/>
Men, and Limb them; but they met with none of them, they having taken effectual Care to ſecure themſelves.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Cinna,</hi> a Confident of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, chanc'd the Night before to have an odd Dream: He fancied that <hi>Caeſar</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him to Supper; and that upon his Refuſal to go with him, <hi>Caeſar</hi> took him by the Hand, and forc'd him, though he hung back. Upon Notice that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Body was burning in the Market-Place, he got up, and went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, out of reſpect to his Memory, though his Dream gave him ſome ill Apprehenſions; and though he was at the ſame time Fevoriſh. One of the Rabble who ſaw him there, ask'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Who that was? And having learnt his Name, told it to his next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: It preſently went for currant, that he was one of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Murtherers; and indeed there was one <hi>Cinna</hi> a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator: They taking this to be the Man, immediately Seized him, and tore him Limb from Limb upon the Spot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> frighted at this, within a few days retir'd out of the

City. What they afterwards did and ſuffer'd, and how they dy'd, is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Life of <hi>Brutus. Caeſar</hi> dy'd in his Fifty ſixth year, not having ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd <hi>Pompey</hi> above four years: That Empire and Power which he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued through the whole Courſe of his Life with ſo much Hazzard, he did at laſt with much difficulty compaſs; but reap'd no other Fruits from it then an empty Name, and invidious Title. But that happy Genius, which was Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to him during his Life, ſeems to have ſtuck to him after his Death, as the Revenger of his Murther; for it purſu'd by Sea and Land all thoſe who were concern'd in it, and ſuffer'd none to eſcape, but reach'd all who were either actually engaged in the Fact, or by their Councels any way promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it.</p>
            <p>The moſt ſignal Accident of all here <hi>below,</hi> was that which befell <hi>Caſſius,</hi> who when he was conquer'd at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> kill'd himſelf with the ſame Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which he had made uſe of againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> The moſt remarkable Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the <hi>Heavens</hi> was a great Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, which ſhone bery bright for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Nights after <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Death, and then

diſappear'd. There was alſo a very faint Light in the Sun; for the Orb of it was pale for the ſpace of an Year, nor did it riſe with its uſual Brightneſs and Vigor. Hence it gave but a weak and feeble Heat, and conſequently the Air was damp and groſs, for want of ſtronger Rays to open and rarifie it: The Fruits, for that Reaſon, were crude and unconcocted, ſo that they rotted and decay'd, through the Chilneſs of the Air. Above all, the Phantôm which appear'd to <hi>Brutus,</hi> ſhew'd the Murther was not pleaſing to the Gods. The Story of it is this.</p>

He thought he heard a Noiſe at the Door of his Tent, and looking that way, by the Light of his Lamp, which was almoſt out, ſaw a terrible Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, like that of a Man, but of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Bulk, and grim Countenance.
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:33760:252"/>
He was ſomewhat frighted at firſt: but ſeeing it neither did nor ſpoke any thing to him, only ſtood ſilently by his Bed-ſide, he ask'd it at laſt, <hi>Who it was?</hi> The Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctre anſwer'd him, <hi>I am thy Evil Genius,</hi> Brutus, <hi>and thou ſhalt ſee me by</hi> Philippi. <hi>Brutus</hi> anſwer'd very courageouſly, <hi>Well, I will ſee you there;</hi> and immediately the Ghoſt vaniſh'd. When the time was come, he drew up his Army near <hi>Philippi</hi> againſt <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and in the firſt Battel got the Day, routed the Enemy, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Camp. The Night before the ſecond Battel, the ſame Ghoſt appear'd to him again, but ſpoke not a word. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently underſtood his Death was near, and expos'd himſelf to all the Danger of the Battel: yet he did not die in the Fight; but ſeeing his Men defeated, got up to the top of a Rock, and there preſenting his Sword to his naked Breaſt, and aſſiſted, as they ſay, by a Friend, who helpt him to give the Thruſt, died upon the Spot.</p>

            <p>Thus it befel <hi>Cato</hi> the younger, whoſe Manners were ſo little agreeable or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the People, that he received very ſlender marks of their Favour; witneſs his repulſe in the Pretences he made to the Conſulate, behaving himſelf, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, rather like a Citizen of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, than among the Lees of <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s Poſterity: the ſame thing happening to him, in my opinion, as we obſerve in Fruits ripe before their ſeaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we rather gaze at and admire than uſe; ſo much was his old-faſhion'd Virtue out of preſent mode, conſidering the depraved Cuſtoms, Time and Luxury had introduc'd, that it appear'd (indeed) ſightly and ſplendid, but ſuited not the preſent Exigencies, being ſo diſproportion'd to the Manners in vogue, and the guiſe of the preſent Times. Yet his Circumſtances were not altogether like <hi>Phocion</hi>'s who came to the Helm when the
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:33760:255"/>
publick Bottom was juſt upon ſinking. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s Time was, indeed, ſtormy and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous, yet ſo as he was able to aſſiſt in managing the Sails, and lend his helping hand to thoſe that ſteer'd: his manly reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution gave Fortune a task of Time and difficulty in ruining the Commonwealth, in which he and his Friends had almoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd againſt her, which yet, by other aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, with long time and tugging, by ſlow degrees was afterwards effected.</p>
            <p>Now we compare <hi>Phocion</hi> to him, not only in the common Reſemblances that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear amongſt great Men and Stateſ-men; for indeed there is ſome difference among Virtues of the ſame denomination, as the Valour of <hi>Alcibiades</hi> and <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> the Prudence of <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> the Juſtice of <hi>Numa</hi> and <hi>Ageſilaus.</hi> But theſe men's Virtues are the ſame, even to the moſt minute differences, having the ſame colour, ſtamp and character impreſſed upon them, ſo as not to be diſtinguiſhable; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you look upon them in the exact mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the one hand, with auſterity on the other; their Gallantry upon ſome occaſions, and Caution on others; their extream ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude for the Publick, and perfect neglect of themſelves; their fixt and immovable bent to all virtuous and honeſt Actions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compani'd with an extream tenderneſs and

ſcrupuloſity of doing any thing might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear mean or unworthy: ſo that in theſe, as in two Inſtruments exactly tuned to each other, he muſt have a nice Ear that can perceive any Diſcord.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Cato</hi>'s Extraction, it's confeſs'd by all to be illuſtrious, (as ſhall be ſaid hereafter) nor was <hi>Phocion</hi>'s (I'm well aſſured) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure or ignoble; for had he been the Son of a Turner, (as <hi>Idomeneus</hi> reports) it had certainly not been forgot to his diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by <hi>Hyperides</hi> the Son of <hi>Glaucippus,</hi> who heaped up a thouſand ſpiteful things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: nor indeed was it poſſible for him in ſuch Circumſtances to have had ſuch liberal Education in his Youth, as to be firſt <hi>Plato</hi>'s, and afterwards <hi>Xenocrates</hi>'s Scholar in the Academy, and in whatever gentile Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, to have been all along emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the very beſt of his Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. His Countenance was ſo compoſed, that ſcarce was he ever ſeen by the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> laughing, or in tears; he indulged not himſelf in the luxury of the publick Baths, (as <hi>Douris</hi> reports) nor ever had his Hands without his Cloak, when he appear'd dreſs'd in publick: Abroad and in the Camp he was ſo hardy to go always thin clad and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, except the Froſt was vehement and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, that the Soldiers uſed to ſay in Merriment, that it was a hard Winter like

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was of moſt eaſie Converſation and great Humanity, his appearance was moroſe and ſowr, ſo that he was ſeldom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted by any that were Strangers to him: upon which occaſion <hi>Chares,</hi> upon a time jeering his ſupercilious Look, and the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> applauding him for it, <hi>Phocion</hi> reply'd <hi>My Sullenneſs never made any of you ſad, but theſe men's Jollity hath given you ſorrow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</hi> In like manner <hi>Phocion</hi>'s Diſcourſe was grave and pithy, full of uſeful Remarks with a ſententious brevity, awful and auſtere, however unpleaſant: after the manner as <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> ſays a Philoſopher ſhould ſpeak, his words throughly tinctur'd with the inward ſenſe of his mind; ſuch was <hi>Phocion</hi>'s who crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much into little room: and to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably <hi>Polyeuctus</hi> the <hi>Sphettian</hi> had regard, when he ſaid, that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was indeed the beſt Orator of his time, but <hi>Phocion</hi> the moſt powerful Speaker; whoſe words were to be eſtimated like ſmaller Coins from the intrinſick value of the Metal, not from the bulk.

Upon which account <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brias,</hi> being a good natur'd man, loved him extreamly, and preferr'd him to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Commands, and effectually recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> uſing his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:33760:257"/>
and taking his advice in all his Affairs of moment: particularly the Sea fight at <hi>Naxus</hi> made not a little to <hi>Phoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s Reputation; for having the left Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron committed to him by <hi>Chabrias,</hi> he ſo managed the Matter, that the Controverſie was quickly decided in their favour by a ſpeedy Victory: and this being the firſt proſperous Diſpute the City had with the <hi>Groecians,</hi> by its ſingle force, ſince it was under Hatches, <hi>Chabrias</hi> the General was mightily adored, and <hi>Phocion</hi> magnifi'd as a man worthy of the greateſt Truſt and Command. This Victory happen'd at the great Solemnities, and <hi>Chabrias</hi> appointed an Anniverſary to commemorate it on the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> on which it was obtained, and diſtributed a Largeſs of Wine among the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians.</hi> Much about this time <hi>Chabrias</hi> ſent <hi>Phocion</hi> to demand their <hi>Quota</hi> of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the War from the <hi>Iſlanders,</hi> and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him a Guard of 20 Sail, he told him, if he intended him to go againſt them as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that force was inſignificant; if as to Friends and Allies, one Veſſel was ſufficient: ſo he took one ſingle Galley, and having viſited the Cities, and treated with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours friendly and apertly, he return'd with a good number of Ships, ſent by the Confederates to <hi>Athens,</hi> with ſupplies for their maintenance.

               <hi>Phocion</hi> having thus conſider'd with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Inclinations and Genius were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways for peace and quietneſs, yet was he engaged in more Wars than any of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors; never indeed promoting or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging ſuch Deſigns, nor, on the other hand, ſhunning or declining any Enterprize when he was call'd to it by the publick ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the State. And thus much is well known, that he was no leſs than 45 ſeveral times choſen General, when he was never once of thoſe times preſent in the Aſſembly; but the Command, in his abſence, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Suffrage, conferr'd on him, and he ſent for on purpoſe to undertake it: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much

that it amazed thoſe that did not well conſider, to ſee the People always preferr <hi>Phocion,</hi> who was ſo far from humouring them, or courting their Favour, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thwarted and oppoſed them. But ſo it was, as great Men and Princes uſe their Buffoons and Jeſters after Meals, for their Diſport and Merriment, ſo the <hi>Athenians</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſlight occaſions entertain'd and diverted themſelves with their ſpruce Speakers and trim Orators; but when it came to dint of Action, they were ſo ſober and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to mark out the graveſt and wiſeſt for publick Employment, however oppoſite to their Sentiments. This he made no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to own, upon the occaſion of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of <hi>Delphos</hi> being read, which informed them, that the reſt of the Citizens being unanimous, there was one only perſon ſo preſumptuous to abound in his own ſence, which he frankly told them was himſelf, bidding them look no further, for he indeed was nothing ſatisfied in all their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Happening afterwards to ſpeak his own opinion, to the General approbation of the Aſſembly, turning to ſome of his Friends, he demanded of them, <hi>What foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thing had eſcaped him unawares to merit their Applauſe?</hi>

Being ſtill clamour'd on and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd, he told them this Tale: <hi>A certain white liver'd Fellow intending for the Wars, hearing the Ravens croak in his paſſage, threw down his Arms, reſolving to be quiet: recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting himſelf after, he adventur'd out again, but hearing the ſame Muſick, made a full ſtop, ſaying, they might tear their Throats (if they pleas'd) for joy of ſmelling a Feaſt, but for his part he was reſolv'd to ſave his Skin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> urging him at an unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time to fall upon the Enemy, he perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily refuſed, and being upbraided by them with Cowardice and Puſillanimity, he told them, <hi>Gentlemen, we underſtand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very well; you cannot make me valiant at this time, nor I you wiſe.</hi> In time of ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the people were very pert and ſevere up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, demanding a ſtrict account how the publick Treaſure had been employed and the like: He bid them firſt be aſſured of their ſafety, and after mind their good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry: in effect, the paſſions of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> alter'd with their Affairs, being extream timorous and ſubmiſs in times of danger; when that was blown over, inſolent and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

was a little to be admired, how a man ſo ſevere and ſmart upon all occaſions as <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> was, ſhould notwithſtanding maintain his Reſpect and Reputation with the People; yet though difficult, it is not impoſſible a man's Temper, like ſome Wines, may have a ſweetneſs mixt with ſome harſhneſs alſo, not at all ungrateful; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſome are ſo extream luſcious, they are both untaſty and unwholſom. <hi>Hyperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> who was ſowre and ſarcaſtical, uſed to excuſe it to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> by ſaying, <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>

            <p>As for the Friends and Allies of the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> the <hi>Iſlanders,</hi> whenever any Admiral beſides <hi>Phocion</hi> was ſent, they treated him as an Enemy ſuſpect, barricado'd their Gates block'd up their Havens, drove the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of their Cattel, Slaves, Wives and Children, and put them in Garriſon: but upon <hi>Phocion</hi>'s Arrival, they went out to welcome him in their Shallops and Barges, with Streamers and Garlands, and received him at Landing, with all demonſtrations of Joy and Triumph. At this time King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> made a deſcent into <hi>Euboea</hi> bringing thither an Army from <hi>Macedonia,</hi> endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to gain the Cities to his Intereſt, by the means of their Governours: <hi>Plutarch</hi> of <hi>Eretria</hi> (a City in <hi>Euboea</hi>) was ſent to pray Aid of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> toward the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Iſland, that was in imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ſurprized by the <hi>Macedonians.

Countrey would flock in amain to him; but when he came, he found all things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, the Countrey betray'd, all corrupted by Bribery, and bought and ſold by the Penſioners to King <hi>Philip,</hi> inſomuch that he ran the greateſt riſque imaginable. To ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf the beſt he could, he poſſeſt himſelf of a ſmall riſing Ground, which was divided from the Camp about <hi>Taminias,</hi> by a large Trench, in which he encloſed the choiceſt of his Army: for the Praters and idle Vagabonds that ſtraggled from the Camp, and forſook their Colours, he bid his Officers not regard them, for that they would not only be diſorderly and ungover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable themſelves, but be a hindrance to the reſt; and further being conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the neglect of their duty, they would be leſs apt to prate and miſrepreſent the Action, or beſpatter them at their return home. When the Enemy drew nigh, he commanded them to ſtand to their Arms, whilſt he went to ſacrifice; in which he ſpent a conſiderable time, either by the te<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diouſneſs of the thing it ſelf, or on purpoſe to invite the Enemy nearer. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting this tardineſs as a failure in his Courage, fell on alone with the Auxiliaries; which the Cavalry perceiving, could not be contained, but iſſuing alſo out of the Camp confuſedly and diſorderly, ſpurr'd up
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:33760:262"/>
to the Enemy. The Van by this means was worſted, the reſt were eaſily diſperſed, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> himſelf ſhow'd a fair pair of heels, as judging the whole Army had been routed. But by this time, the Sacrifice being over, thoſe within the Camp made a Head, and fell upon them that were got to the Ditch, putting them to flight, and cutting many of them in pieces: and <hi>Phocion</hi> having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a particular Squadron to watch their motions, and purſue thoſe that firſt gave way in the Skirmiſh, himſelf afterwards, with a reſerve of his beſt men, engaged the whole Body of the Enemy in a ſharp and bloody Fight, in which all of them behaved themſelves with remarkable Courage and Gallantry. <hi>Thallus</hi> the Son of <hi>Cineas,</hi> and <hi>Glaucus</hi> of <hi>Polymedes,</hi> that fought near the General, ſignalized themſelves; ſo did alſo <hi>Cleophanes</hi> merit the Reputation of a brave man, having every where laid about him, and call'd upon the Horſe that were whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to ſuccour the General, who was in danger, he made them face about, ſo as to confirm the Victory already obtained by the Infantry. By which means <hi>Plutarch</hi> was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of <hi>Eretria,</hi> and the commodious Caſtle of it was taken, being ſituate in that part of the Iſland, where it is narrowed into a ſmall neck of Land, the reſt of the Iſland being ſurrounded other-where by the Sea.</p>

               <pb n="515" facs="tcp:33760:262"/>He would not permit them to take any of the <hi>Greeks</hi> Priſoners, for fear the Orators at <hi>Athens</hi> ſhould inflame the People againſt them, to determine ſomething to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>This Affair thus diſpatch'd and ſettled, <hi>Phocion</hi> ſet Sail homewards, having given moſt manifeſt tokens of his Juſtice and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity to the <hi>Allies,</hi> and to the <hi>Athenians</hi> indiſputable proofs of his Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. His Succeſſor <hi>Moloſſus</hi> had worſe fate to fall alive into the Enemies hands, which inſpired <hi>Philip</hi> with great thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, to move with all his force into the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> ſo to the <hi>Cherſoneſus</hi> and <hi>Perin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus,</hi> and on to <hi>Byzantium.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> raiſing Recruits to relieve them, the <hi>Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi> made it their buſineſs to preferr <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> to be General, who ſailing thither, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected nothing worthy of ſuch an Equipage; nor would the Confederates harbour his Fleet, having jealouſie of him, ſo that he did nothing but pirate about, pillaging their Friends, and deſpiſed by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Upon this occaſion, the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chaſed by the Orators, were in great Ferment, and highly enraged they had been ſo fool'd, to ſend any Succour to the <hi>Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines:</hi> whereupon <hi>Phocion</hi> riſing up, told them, <hi>My Maſters, you have not ſo much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be concern'd at the Jealouſies of your</hi>
               <pb n="516" facs="tcp:33760:263"/>
               <hi>Friends, as the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfaithfulneſs of your own Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, who render you ſuſpected, even to thoſe who yet can't poſſibly ſubſiſt without your Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.</hi> The Aſſembly being moved with this Speech of his, chang'd their minds on the ſudden, and commanded him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to raiſe more Force, and aſſiſt their Confederates in the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> which would be of the greateſt moment for the ſecurity of <hi>Byzantium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Phocion</hi>'s Name was up, and an old Acquaintance of his, who had been his fellow-Student in the Academy, <hi>Cleon,</hi> a man of higheſt renown for Virtue among the <hi>Byzantines,</hi> having vouch'd for <hi>Phocion</hi> to the City, they opened their Gates to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, not permitting him (though he deſired it) to incamp without the Walls, but entertained him and all the <hi>Athenians</hi> with entire Reſpect; and they to requite their Conſidence, converſed with their new Hoſts, not only ſoberly and inoffenſively, but behaved themſelves on all occaſions with great chearfulneſs and reſolution for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Thus came King <hi>Philip</hi> to be driven out of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and deſpiſed to boot, who was till now thought impoſſible to be match'd, and even apprehended invincible. <hi>Phocion</hi> alſo took ſome of his Ships, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took ſome of the Places he had garriſon'd, making beſides ſeveral Inrodes into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:33760:263"/>
which he plunder'd and over-run, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as he happen'd to be wounded by ſome of them that came to his Aſſiſtance, he made off towards home.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Megareans</hi> at this time privately pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aid of the <hi>Athenians, Phocion</hi> fearing leſt the <hi>Boeotians</hi> being aware of it, ſhould prevent them call'd an Aſſembly very early in the morning, and backing the <hi>Boeotians</hi> Petition, it was put to the Queſtion, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their favour. As ſoon as ever it was done, he made Proclamation immediately by ſound of Trumpet, and led them off ſtraight from the Aſſembly, to arm and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in poſture. The <hi>Megareans</hi> received them joyfully, they help'd them to fortifie <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoea,</hi> and build two new Bulwarks on each ſide, from the City to the Haven, and ſo joyn'd it to the Sea; ſo that being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently defended on the Land ſide from the Aſſailants, it was ſecured to the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now was the time that the Liberty of <hi>Greece</hi> was openly diſputed with King <hi>Philip,</hi> and at <hi>Athens</hi> ſuch Chiefs choſen in <hi>Phocion</hi>'s abſence, that at his arrival from the Iſlands he dealt earneſtly with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> (being deeply poſſeſs'd what danger might enſue) that ſince <hi>Philip</hi> ſhow'd ſome peaceable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations towards them, they would conſent to a Treaty, being contradicted in this by a prating pick-thank Fellow of thoſe ſort of

Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thus with <hi>Phocion</hi> as his Friend and Confident, he did him that Honour, which few of thoſe that were next his Perſon ever received; inſomuch that <hi>Douris</hi> reports, when he grew great and high, after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of <hi>Darius,</hi> he left off the word <hi>Greeting</hi> in all his Letters, except in only thoſe that were directed to <hi>Phocion</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to uſe it, which alſo is confirmed by

               <hi>Chares.</hi> As for his Munificence to him, it is well known he ſent him a Preſent at one time of a 100 Talents, which being brought to <hi>Athens, Phocion</hi> demanded of the Bearers, how it came to paſs, that among all the reſt of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> he alone ſhould be ſo highly obliged to his Bounty? and being told, that <hi>Alexander</hi> eſteemed him (only) a Perſon of Honour and Worth: <hi>May it pleaſe him then,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to permit me to continue ſo, and be ſtill ſo reputed.</hi> Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to his Houſe, and obſerving his ſimple and plain way of Living, his Wife imploy'd in the Paſtry-work with her own hands, himſelf pumping Water to waſh his Feet; they preſs'd him to accept it, with ſome Indignation, being aſham'd, (as they ſaid) that <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Friend ſhould live ſo poorly and pitifully. <hi>Phocion</hi> taking notice of a poor old Fellow in a tatter'd Coat paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by, asked them, <hi>If they thought him in worſe condition than that poor Wretch?</hi> They begg'd his pardon for the Compariſon; <hi>yet,</hi> ſays he, <hi>this man has leſs to live upon than I and is content; and in ſhort, I muſt tell you, if this ſumm be more than I can uſe, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſuperfluous; if I live up to it, I ſhall give cauſe of jealouſie both of your Maſter and my ſelf to the reſt of the Citizens.</hi> So the Treaſure was returned back from <hi>Athens,</hi> giving the <hi>Gracians</hi> an illuſtrious Example,

how much truly richer the man is, who by contracting his mind, has no occaſion for more, than him who by the largeneſs of his Fortunes is capable of the largeſt Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. <hi>Alexander</hi> was diſpleaſed at this, and writ to him again, acquainting him, <hi>That he could not eſteem thoſe his Friends, who thought much to be obliged by him.</hi> Yet neither would this prevail with <hi>Phocion</hi> to accept the Money, but he made uſe of his favour to intercede for <hi>Echecratides</hi> the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſt, and <hi>Athenodorus</hi> the <hi>Imbrian,</hi> as alſo for <hi>Demaratus</hi> and <hi>Sparton,</hi> two <hi>Rhodians,</hi> that had been convicted of certain Crimes, and were in cuſtody at <hi>Sardis,</hi> that he would pleaſe to enlarge them: This was preſently granted by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and they were ſet at liberty.

This encourag'd him once more to feel his pulſe, and attack him; but he found him like a ſtrong Fortreſs, every way ſo defended, that even the Golden Key could gain no admittance, on all ſides inacceſſible and impregnable: Yet having made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Friendſhip with <hi>Phocion</hi>'s Son in Law <hi>Charicles,</hi> and uſing him with entire confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in all his affairs, he brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome ſuſpicion: Upon the occaſion of <hi>Pythonica</hi> the Courteſans dying, who was <hi>Harpalus</hi>'s Miſtreſs, for whom he had a great fondneſs, and had a Child by her; he reſolv'd to build her a ſumptuous Monument, and committed the care of it to his Friend <hi>Charicles.</hi> This deſign, vain enough in it ſelf, was yet further diſparag'd by the workmanſhip, after it was finiſhed (for it is yet to be ſeen in <hi>Hermio,</hi> as we go from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Eleuſina,</hi> there appearing nothing anſwerable to the ſum of 30 Talents, ſaid

Phocion</hi> preſs'd him with much earneſtneſs, only to ſpare the Garriſon, and uſed many Arguments and Intreaties: <hi>Antipater</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>He ſhould find him compliant in any thing to his requeſt, that did not inevitably tend no the ruin of them both.</hi> Others report it differently, that <hi>Antipater</hi> ſhould ask <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, If he remitted the Garriſon to the</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <hi>he would ſtand Surety for the City to demean themſelves peaceably, and endeavour no Innovations?</hi> To which when he demurr'd and made no return; on the ſudden <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon</hi> the <hi>Carabian,</hi> a hot man, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Enemy to Free States, roſe up, asking <hi>Antipater</hi> if he would ſuffer himſelf to be
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:33760:273"/>
juggled withal, and have his confidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed ſo far as not to act what he thought moſt expedient? So the <hi>Athenians</hi> receiv'd the Garriſon, and <hi>Menyllus</hi> for the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, a fair condition'd man, and one of <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi>'s Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>This proceeding ſeem'd ſufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious and arbitrary, indeed rather a ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſulting and oſtentation of power, than that the poſſeſſing himſelf of that Fortreſs, would be of any real advantage to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. The reſentment of this uſage was heightned by the time it happened in: For it fortun'd the Garriſon was brought in in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> juſt at the time of the great Feſtival, when <hi>Bacchus</hi> was carried with ſolemn Pomp from the City to <hi>Eleuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> ſo that the Solemnity being diſturb'd, many began to recollect what had happen'd at the time of thoſe Rites both anciently and modernly. For of old, in their greateſt proſperity, there had been odd appearances ſeen, and Voices heard at the time of their Celebration, which ſtruck terror and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement into their Enemies; but now at the ſame ſeaſon, the Gods themſelves ſtood Wittneſſes of the extream oppreſſions of <hi>Greece;</hi> the Holy time being prophan'd, and their greateſt Jubilee made the unlucky date of their moſt extream calamity. Not many years before, they had brought an
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:33760:273"/>
Advertiſement from the Oracle at <hi>Dodona,</hi> That they ſhould carefully Guard the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory of <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple, and ſecure it from the poſſeſſion of Strangers: And about the ſame time when they dyed the Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds and Garlands, with which they adorn'd the Pageants in devotion to her; inſtead of a Purple, they receiv'd only a faint dead co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and which added to the Omen, all thoſe things that were dyed for common uſe took the natural colour. Alſo a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer waſhing a Porket in the Haven, whilſt it was calm, a <hi>Shark</hi> ſeiz'd on him, bit off all his hinder parts to the Belly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them; by which they imagin'd the God gave them apparently to underſtand, that having already loſt the lower parts of their Territories, towards the Sea coaſt, they ſhould more carefully guard thoſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City.</p>
            <p>Now the Garriſon under <hi>Menyllus</hi> was no ways offenſive to thoſe of the better ſort, but of the meaner ſort, the number of whom (who by reaſon of their poverty were not taxed) were reckon'd in the City to be above 12000; thoſe that remain'd in the City thought themſelves oppreſs'd and affronted, and thoſe that had gone away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Thrace,</hi> on whom <hi>Antipater</hi> had beſtow'd a Town, and ſome Territories to inhabit, accounted themſelves only as a Colony of
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:33760:274"/>
Slaves and Exiles. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> dyed at that time in <hi>Calabria,</hi> and <hi>Hyperides</hi> at <hi>Cleona,</hi> a City of <hi>Greece,</hi> (as we have elſe-where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) which put the Citizens in mind of the death of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wiſhing the return of thoſe times. Juſt as after <hi>Antigonus</hi> was ſlain; and thoſe that had taken him off, afterwards more grievouſly afflicting and oppreſſing the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; a Countryman in <hi>Phrygia</hi> digging in the Fields, was ask'd what he was doing? <hi>I am,</hi> ſays he, (fetching a deep ſigh) <hi>ſearching again for</hi> Antigonus. So ſaid many that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred thoſe days, and the diſputes they had with thoſe Kings, whoſe anger, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver great, was yet generous and placable; whereas <hi>Antipater,</hi> with the counterfeit hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of appearing like a private man, in the meanneſs of his Habit and homely Fare, covered the haughtineſs of his Mind, and inſolently abuſing his power, was indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable to thoſe under his Command be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extream Lordly and Tyranical. Yet <hi>Phocion</hi> had intereſt with him to recal many from Baniſhment by his intreaty, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd alſo for thoſe that fled away, that they might not, like others, be hurried beyond <hi>Foenarus</hi> and the Mountains of <hi>Ceraunia,</hi> but remain in <hi>Greece,</hi> and plant themſelves in <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> of which number was <hi>Agnonides</hi> the Sycophant He no leſs ſtudiouſly manag'd

the affairs within the City, with ſignal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and Moderation, preferring conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that were Men of Worth and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Magiſtracy; keeping out the factious and turbulent, leſt they ſhould abuſe their power to raiſe ſtirs, and thoſe that were decayed, he advis'd to retire into the<note place="margin">

Obſerving that <hi>Zenocrates</hi> payed his Aſſeſsments as a Forei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gner, he would have perſwaded him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his freedom; which he refus'd, ſaying: <hi>He could not receive it from that City, whoſe Liberties and Franchiſes were doomed, when he himſelf was one of the Embaſſadors. Menyllus</hi> offered <hi>Phocion</hi> a conſiderable Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who, thanking him, ſaid, <hi>Neither was he greater than</hi> Alexander, <hi>nor his own occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more urgent to receive it now, who then refuſed it from him:</hi> But ſtill preſſing him to permit his Son <hi>Phocus</hi> to receive it, he replyed; <hi>If my Son returns to his right mind, his Patrimony is ſufficient, if not, in the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he now takes, all ſupplies will be inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</hi> But to <hi>Antipater</hi> he anſwered more tartly, who would have him engaged in ſomething diſhonourable; <hi>Antipater</hi> ſays he, <hi>can't uſe me both as a Friend and a Flatterer.</hi> And indeed <hi>Antipater</hi> was wont to ſay, he had two Friends at <hi>Athens, Phocion</hi> and <hi>Demades,</hi> the one would never ſuffer him to gratifie him at all, the other would never be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:33760:275"/>
For <hi>Phocion's</hi> Virtue made his Poverty appear reputable, having ſo oft been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Friendſhip of ſo many Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, he had yet grown old and poor in the ſervice of the Common-wealth: But <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mades</hi> prided himſelf by laviſhing his Wealth, to break in upon the Publick Conſtitutions and affront them: For there having been an Order that no Foreigner ſhould be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to Dance at the Publick Shows, on the penalty of 1000 <hi>Drachma's</hi> to be levied on him that ſhould exhibit them; his vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was ſo great to hire 100 Strangers, and paid the Fine for them all in ready Caſh upon the Stage. Marrying his Son <hi>Demeas</hi> at that time, he told him with the like vanity, <hi>Son, when I married your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it was done ſo privately it was not known to the next Neighbours; but Kings and Princes ſhow themſelves forward to preſent you at your Nuptials.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Still this Garriſon was a grievous eye-ſore to the Commonalty among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and they ceaſed not clamouring upon <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,</hi> to prevail with <hi>Antipater</hi> for its remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; but when he deſpair'd of effecting it, or rather obſerved the People more gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and behaving themſelves more order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Awe that was upon them, he conſtantly declined that Office; yet as to the
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:33760:275"/>
Money-matter, effectually obtained of him, not to demand the Subſidy agreed on, but prolonged the time of its payment. So the People, leaving him off, apply'd themſelves to <hi>Demades,</hi> who readily undertook the Employment and took along with him his Son alſo into <hi>Macedonia;</hi> the Devil, as it ſeem'd, owing him a ſhame, he came juſt at that nick of time, when <hi>Antipater</hi> was ſeized with Sickneſs, and <hi>Caſſander</hi> taking upon himſelf the Command, had found a Letter of <hi>Demades</hi>'s, formerly writ by him to <hi>Antigonus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> moving him to take upon himſelf the Empire of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> which now ſtood upon an old and rotten Stalk, ſo rallying <hi>Antipater.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when <hi>Caſſander</hi> heard of his coming, he ſeized him, and having cauſed his Son to be brought before his Face, ſlew him, ſo ordering it, that the Son's Blood ſhould fly upon the Father, and bedawb him; after, bitterly taunting and upbraiding him with his Ingratitude and Treachery, he diſpatch'd him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antipater</hi> (having nominated <hi>Polyperchon</hi> General, and <hi>Caſſander</hi> Colonel) being dead, <hi>Caſſander</hi> preſently ſet up for himſelf, and immediately diſpatch'd <hi>Nicanor</hi> to <hi>Menyllus,</hi> to be his Succeſſor in the <hi>Athenian</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, commanding him to poſſeſs himſelf of it, before the News of <hi>Antipater</hi>'s Death,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:33760:276"/>
ſhould be bruited abroad. Which being done, and ſome days after the <hi>Athenians</hi> hearing the Report of it, <hi>Phocion</hi> was taxt, as privy to it before, and cenſured heavily for diſſembling it, as a Friend and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of <hi>Nicanor</hi>'s: but he ſlighted their tittle tattle, and meeting oft and conferring with <hi>Nicanor,</hi> made it his buſineſs to render him civil and obliging to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and not only ſo, but perſwaded him to ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence upon them, and have ſome Shows at his own charge to entertain the People. In the mean time, <hi>Polyperchon,</hi> to whoſe Care the chief Affairs were committed, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <hi>Caſſander,</hi> writ a cunning Letter to the City, declaring, that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their ancient Privileges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and were at entire liberty to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Commonwealth, according to their ancient Cuſtoms and Conſtitutions. The bottom of theſe Pretences was meer Stratagem and Trick, levell'd principally againſt <hi>Phocion,</hi> as the Event manifeſted it ſelf; for <hi>Polyperchon</hi>'s deſign being to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf of the City, he deſpaired altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of bringing it to paſs, whilſt <hi>Phocion</hi> lived, and in Credit: but the moſt certain way to ruine him, would be again to bring into play the <hi>Demagogues,</hi> who had been put out of Office for ſeditious Practices, and reſtore them to their Places of Truſt, both
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:33760:276"/>
in the Courts of Judicature, and <hi>their Votes in Common-Council.</hi> Thus the <hi>Populace</hi> being let looſe, preſently great Commotions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in <hi>Athens,</hi> which <hi>Nicanor</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to compoſe, call'd the Senate together into the <hi>Pyroeum,</hi> and came thither himſelf, committing himſelf to <hi>Phocion</hi> for his ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;<note place="margin">Locus 5. vel 6. miliar. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. diſtans, ubi Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Mynich.</note> but one <hi>Dercyllus,</hi> a Captain of the Train-bands in the Suburbs, attempting to ſeize him, he having ſome hint of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf, giving out that he would ſuddenly right himſelf upon the City for this Affront. <hi>Phocion</hi> was accuſed for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near him, and not ſeizing him, as he was required; but he defended himſelf, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he had no manner of miſtruſt of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> nor the leaſt reaſon to expect any miſchief from him; but ſhould it prove o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways, for his part he would have them all know, he had rather receive, than do an ill thing to any Man. This Carriage of <hi>Phocion</hi>'s, fairly and ſimply conſidered, would appear extream generous and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-like; yet looking upon a man ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in relation to his Countrey, now endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd, and that in the higheſt ſtation of Power and Authority there is ſomething (methinks) of prior Conſideration and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Obligation of Juſtice, in diſcharging the truſt repoſed in him, to be regarded, much rather than ſuch Points of Honour:
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:33760:277"/>
for it is not a ſatisfactory pretence to ſay, that he dreaded the involving the City in War, by ſeizing <hi>Nicanor,</hi> nor that in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Juſtice he could not lay hands on a man, who had given him all the aſſurance and ſecurity in the world, that he would no ways moleſt or diſturb the <hi>Athenian</hi> State; but it was, <hi>indeed,</hi> his Credulity and Confidence in him, and an over-ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opinion of his Sincerity, that impoſed upon him: ſo that notwithſtanding the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Intimations he had from thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him of having Deſigns on the <hi>Pyroe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and ſending numbers of Mercenaries into <hi>Salamina,</hi> beſides his tampering with, and endeavouring to corrupt thoſe of <hi>Pyroe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> (where his Garriſon ſtood) he would (notwithſtanding all this Evidence) never be perſwaded to belive it. Nay further, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Philomedes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lampres,</hi> had got a Decree paſs'd, that all the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſhould ſtand to their Arms, and be ready to follow <hi>Phocion</hi> their General, he yet ſate ſtill and ſecure, till ſuch time as <hi>Nicanor</hi> had actually brought down Arms and Ammunition from <hi>Minichia</hi> to <hi>Pyroeum,</hi> and begun to draw Trenches round it. Whilſt theſe things were tranſacted when <hi>Phocion</hi> (at laſt) would have led out the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> they mutined againſt him, and ſlighted his Orders.</p>

               <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of <hi>Polyperchon,</hi> was at hand with a conſiderable Force, pretended to be for ſuccour of the City againſt <hi>Nica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> but intended nothing leſs (if poſſible) than to ſurprize the City, whilſt they were in Tumult, and divided among themſelves: for thoſe that had been baniſhed, getting into the City, to whom the Foreigners joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and all the Rabble rout thronging in to them, they made up an odd irregular mixt Convention, wherein they preſently diveſted <hi>Phocion</hi> of all Power, and choſe to themſelves other Commanders; and if by chance <hi>Alexander</hi> had not been ſpy'd from the Walls, alone, and in cloſe Conſult with <hi>Nicanor,</hi> and given the <hi>Athenians</hi> juſt cauſe of Suſpicion, certainly the City at that moment had run a great Riſque.

how ſtudious he had been of the Intereſt of the People; to which he reply'd furiouſly; <hi>Forbear to belye me before the King:</hi> the King ſtarting up was about to have darted him through with his Javelin, but <hi>Polyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon</hi> interpoſed and hinder'd him; ſo the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was diſſolved.</p>

<pb n="548" facs="tcp:33760:279"/>
               <hi>Clitus</hi> brought in his Priſoners. The men of higheſt Quality bluſh'd at the ſight of <hi>Phocion,</hi> and hanging down their Heads, could not forbear Tears: One of them was ſo hardy to ſay, Since the <hi>King</hi> was ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to permit them freedom in Judgment, he thought it reaſonable to diſmiſs the Strangers, and thoſe of ſervile condition, from the Aſſembly; but the Populace would not endure it, crying out, They were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Commonwealth, and Betrayers of the Liberty of the People, and deſerved to be ſtoned that ſided with the Nobility; after which no man durſt offer any thing farther in <hi>Phocion</hi>'s behalf.

whereby the People were impowered to have a Poll for majority of Voices, whether they judged them <hi>Guilty;</hi> and if ſo it ſhould be found, to be ſentenced to Death.

               <pb n="555" facs="tcp:33760:283"/>alſo was his Siſter by the Mother's-ſide. All theſe lived together, and were bred up in the Houſe of <hi>Livius Druſus,</hi> their Uncle by the Mother; who at that time had a great ſhare in the Government; for he was very Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, remarkably Juſt, and in Wiſdom not inferior to any of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid of <hi>Cato,</hi> that he did, even from his Infancy, in his Speech, his Countenance, and all his childiſh Paſtimes, diſcover an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible Temper, unmoved by any Paſſion, and firm in every thing.</p>
            <p>He would force himſelf, much beyond the ſtrength of his Age, to go through with whatever he undertook. He was rough and ungentle toward them that flattered him; but yet more ſtubborn and untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe who threatned him. He was very difficultly moved to laugh; and was rarely ſeen to ſmile. Not quickly or eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked to Anger; but if once incenſed, he was no leſs difficultly pacified.</p>
            <p>When he began to learn, he proved dull, and ſlow to apprehend; but what he once conceived, he very faithfully retained. And truly 'tis uſual in Nature, that men of quick Apprehenſions have not the beſt Memories; but thoſe who receive things with moſt pains and difficulty, remember them with moſt exactneſs: for every new thing that is learnt ſeems to make ſome new impreſſion
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:33760:284"/>
upon the Mind. Hence the difficulty there was in <hi>Cato</hi> to be moved, made it the more difficult for him to be taught; for to learn is to ſuffer a kind of Alteration: and it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that thoſe are moſt eaſily wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who have leaſt ſtrength to oppoſe what is offered. Hence young men are ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, than thoſe that are more in years; and Sick men, than thoſe that are well in Health: in fine where the Reſiſtance is leaſt powerful, the Impreſſion is moſt eaſily made. Yet <hi>Cato</hi> (they ſay) was very obedient to his Schoolmaſter, and would do whatever he was commanded; but he would alſo ask the Reaſon, and enquire the Cauſe of every thing: and indeed his Schoolmaſter was a very courteous man, more ready to inſtruct, than to beat his Scholars; his Name was <hi>Sarpedo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Cato</hi> was a Child, the Allies of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſued to be made free-Citizens of <hi>Rome. Pompoedius Sillo,</hi> one of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, a brave Souldier, and a man of great worth, who had contracted a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>Druſus,</hi> lodged at his Houſe for ſeveral days; in which Time being grown familiar with the Children, <hi>Well,</hi> (ſaid he to them) <hi>will you entreat your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend us in our Buſineſs? Coepio</hi> ſmiling, ſeemed to conſent; but <hi>Cato</hi> made no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, only he looked ſtedfaſtly and fiercely
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:33760:284"/>
on the Strangers: Then ſaid <hi>Pompoedius</hi> to him, <hi>And you young man, what ſay you to us? will not you, as well as your Brother, intercede with your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle in our behalf? Cato</hi> Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill unmoved; but by his Silence and his Countenance ſeeming to deny their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Pompoedius</hi> ſnatch'd him up to the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as if he would throw him out: then he urged him to conſent, or he would fling him down; and ſpeaking in a harſher Tone, held his Body out of the Window, and ſhook him ſeveral times. When <hi>Cato</hi> had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered this a good while, unmoved and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned; <hi>Pompoedius</hi> ſetting him down, ſaid ſoftly to his Friends, <hi>What a Bleſſing is this Child to</hi> Italy? <hi>if he were a Man, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we ſhould not gain one Voice among the People.</hi> Another time, one of his Relations, on his Birth-day, invited <hi>Cato</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Children to Supper, who diverting themſelves in a part of the Houſe, were at Play all together, the elder and the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; their Play was to act the Pleading of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before the Judges, accuſing one another, and carrying away the Condemned to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Among theſe, a very beautiful young Child being bound and carried by a bigger into Priſon, he cryed out to <hi>Cato;</hi> who preſently run to the Door, and thruſting away thoſe who ſtood there as a Guard, took out the Youth, and went home in
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:33760:285"/>
great Anger followed by all his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> at length grew ſo famous among them, that when <hi>Sylla</hi> Deſigned to exhibit the Game of young men riding Races on Horſeback, which they called the <hi>Trojan Courſe,</hi> having got together all the Youth of Quality, he appointed two for their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. One of them they accepted for his Mother's ſake, which was the Son of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tella,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Sylla;</hi> but for the other, which was <hi>Sextus,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Pompey,</hi> they would not be led by him, nor exerciſed under him: then <hi>Sylla</hi> asking, Whom they would have? They all cryed out, <hi>Cato;</hi> and <hi>Sextus</hi> willingly yielded the Honour to him, as the more worthy Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sylla,</hi> having had a Friendſhip with their Father, did often ſend for <hi>Cato</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and would talk familiarly with them; a Favour which he ſhewed to very few, by reaſon of the great Power and high Station which he had gotten. <hi>Sarpedo,</hi> conſidering the Advantage hereof as well for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as the Safety of his Scholars, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bring <hi>Cato</hi> to wait upon <hi>Sylla</hi> at his Houſe, which, for the multitude of thoſe that were ſlain, impriſoned, and tormented there, looked like a Place of Execution. <hi>Cato</hi> was then about 14 years old; now ſeeing the Heads of great Men brought thither, and
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:33760:285"/>
obſerving the ſecret Sighs of thoſe that were preſent, he asked his Schoolmaſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Why does no body kill this Man? Becauſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>they fear him, Child, more than they hate him: Why then</hi> (replied <hi>Cato) do you not give me a Sword, that I may ſtab him, and free my Countrey from this Slavery? Sarpedo</hi> hearing this, and at the ſame time ſeeing his Countenance full of Anger and Fury, took care thence-forward to watch him ſtrictly, leſt he ſhould fall into any deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Attempt.</p>
            <p>While he was yet very young; to ſome that asked him, Whom he loved beſt? He anſwered, His Brother: And being asked, Whom next? He replied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Brother again: So likewiſe the third time; and ſtill the ſame, till they left off to ask any farther. As he grew in Age, this Love to his Brother increaſed; for when he was about 20 years old, he never ſupped, never went out of Town, nor into the <hi>Forum,</hi> without <hi>Coepio;</hi> but when his Brother made uſe of Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Perfumes, theſe <hi>Cato</hi> rejected: And he was in the whole courſe of his Life very regular and auſtere; ſo that when <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi> was admired for his Moderation and Temperance, he would acknowledge, that indeed he might be accounted ſuch, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome other men; <hi>but</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>when I compare my ſelf with</hi> Cato, <hi>methinks I</hi>
               <pb n="560" facs="tcp:33760:286"/>
               <hi>differ not at all from</hi> Sippius; one at that time notorious for Softneſs and Luxury.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato,</hi> being made one of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Prieſts, changed his Habitation, took his portion of their paternal Inheritance, and began to live yet more ſeverely than before. Having gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an intimate Acquaintance with <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the Stoick Philoſopher, he bent himſelf chiefly to the Study of Moral Philoſophy and Politicks.</p>
            <p>He was carried, as it were, by a kind of Inſpiration, to embrace every Virtue; but moſt inclined, to delight in a ſort of ſteady Juſtice, that was not to be wrought upon by Favour or Compaſſion. He learned alſo the Art of ſpeaking in publick; which he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a thing no leſs requiſite for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, than the Art of War, for defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a City. But he would never recite his Speeches before Company; nor was he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard declame: And to one that told him, Men blamed his Silence; <hi>but I hope not my Life,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>and I will then begin to ſpeak, when I think I can ſay ſomething that is worth being ſpoken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a great Hall, which had been built and dedicated to the Publick by old <hi>Cato;</hi> here the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the People uſed to keep Court: And becauſe a certain Pillar ſeemed not to ſtand well for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Benches, they deliberated, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:33760:286"/>
it were beſt to remove it only, or to take it away. This Buſineſs firſt drew <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> into the <hi>Forum,</hi> tho' much againſt his will; for he therein oppoſed the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> and at the ſame time gave an admirable Specimen both of his Courage and his Eloquence. His Speech had nothing in it of childiſh or affected, but was rough, vehement, and full of ſence; beſides he had a certain grace in ſpeaking, which charmed the Ear, and agreed well with the ſhortneſs of his Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and ſomething of Mirth and Raillery mingled with the Gravity of his Temper, was not unpleaſant to his Auditors. His Voice was full, ſounding, and ſufficient to be heard by ſo great a Multitude. His Vigour, and the ſtrength of his Body inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable; for he could ſpeak a whole day, and never be weary.</p>
            <p>When he had carried this Cauſe, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf again to his Study and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; where he accuſtomed his Body to Labour and violent Excerciſe: would uſe himſelf to go bare-headed both in hot and cold Weather. When he went abroad with any of his Friends, tho' they were on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and he on Foot, yet he would often joyn now one, then another, and diſcourſe with them on the way.</p>
            <p>In Sickneſs, admirable was the Patience he ſhewed in ſupporting; and the Abſtinence
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:33760:287"/>
he uſed, for curing his Diſtempers. One time when he had an Ague, he would be alone all day long, and ſuffer no body to ſee him, till he began to recover, and found the Fit was over. At Supper when he threw Dice for the choice of the Meſſes, and loſt, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany offered him nevertheleſs his choice; but the refuſed, ſaying, <note n="*" place="margin">Alluding to the lucky Chance, called <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Venus forbids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At firſt he was wont to drink only once after Supper, and then go away, but in proceſs of time he grew to drink more, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that oftentimes he would continue at Table till morning. This his Friends ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed; for that the State Affairs took him up all day, and he being deſirous of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, did paſs the night at Table in the Converſation of Philoſophers. Hence one <hi>Memmius</hi> ſaying in Company, That <hi>Cato</hi> ſpent whole nights in Drinking; <hi>But you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay (replied</hi> Cicero) <hi>that he ſpends whole days in Playing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> eſteemed the Cuſtoms and Manners of Men at that time ſo corrupt, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in them ſo neceſſary, that he thought it requiſite in many things, to go contrary to the ordinary way of the World. Wherefore ſeeing the lighteſt and gayeſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours were moſt in faſhion, he would always wear the darkeſt: and he would often go out of doors without either Shooes or Coat. Not that he ſought Vain-glory from ſuch
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:33760:287"/>
Novelties; but he would accuſtom himſelf to be aſhamed only of what deſerves ſhame and to deſpiſe all other ſorts of diſgrace.</p>
            <p>The Eſtate of one <hi>Cato,</hi> his Couſin-ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, (which was worth 100 Talents) fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, he turned it all into ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which he kept by him for any of his Friends that ſhould happen to want, to whom he would lend it without uſe; for ſome of them, he ſuffered his own Land and his Slaves to be mortgaged to the publick Treaſury.</p>
            <p>When he thought himſelf of an Age fit to marry, having never before known any Woman, he was contracted to <hi>Lepida,</hi> who had before been contracted to <hi>Metellus Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio;</hi> but he having quitted her, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract was diſſolved, and ſhe at liberty: yet <hi>Scipio</hi> afterward repenting himſelf, did all he could to regain her, before the Marriage with <hi>Cato</hi> was compleat; and therein ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. At which <hi>Cato</hi> was very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, and reſolved to go to Law about it; but his Friends perſwaded him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; however he was ſo moved by the heat of Youth and Paſſion, that he writ Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicks againſt <hi>Scipio,</hi> which had all the Wit and Satyr of <hi>Archilochus,</hi> without his Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Scurrility. After this he married <hi>Atilia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Sorranus,</hi> which was the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not the only Woman he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew; in this much leſs happy than
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:33760:288"/>
               <hi>Loelius,</hi> the Friend of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who in the whole courſe of ſo long a Life never knew but one Woman.</p>
            <p>In the War made by the Rebellion of the Slaves, (which was named from <hi>Spartacus</hi> their Ring-leader) <hi>Gellius</hi> was General; and <hi>Cato</hi> went a Voluntier, for the ſake of his Brother <hi>Coepio,</hi> who was a Colonel in that Army. But <hi>Cato</hi> could find no opportunity to ſhew his Courage, or exerciſe his Valour by reaſon of the ill Conduct of the General; however admidſt the Corruptions and Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that Army, he ſhewed ſuch a love of Diſcipline, ſo much Bravery upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo much Wiſdom in every thing, that it appeared he would not be any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the old <hi>Cato.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> offered him great Rewards, and would have decreed him conſiderable Honours; which he refuſed, ſaying, He had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that deſerved them; and this made him be thought a man of a very odd Humour.</p>
            <p>There was a Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Candidates who ſtood for any Office, ſhould not have Prompters to tell them the Names of the Citizens. <hi>Cato,</hi> when he ſued to be elected <hi>Military Tribune,</hi> was the only man that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed that Law; he took great pains to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute thoſe he met, and call them by their Names. Yet for theſe things he was envied, even by thoſe who praiſed him; for the
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:33760:288"/>
more they conſidered the Excellency of what he did, the more they were grieved at the difficulty they found to do the like.</p>
            <p>Now being choſen <hi>Military Tribune,</hi> he was ſent into <hi>Macedon</hi> after <hi>Rubrius,</hi> who was General there. It is ſaid, that his Wife ſhewing much Concern, and weeping at his Departure, <hi>Munatius,</hi> one of <hi>Cato's</hi> Friends ſaid to her, <hi>Do not trouble your ſelf,</hi> Atilia, <hi>I'll take care to keep him for you. Ay, by all means,</hi> replied <hi>Cato.</hi> When they had gone one days Journey together; <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid he to <hi>Munatius, that you may be ſure to keep your promiſe to</hi> Atilia, <hi>you muſt not leave me day nor night;</hi> and then ordered two Beds to be made in his own Chamber, that <hi>Munatius</hi> might lie there: ſo that he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather to be kept by <hi>Cato.</hi> There went with him fifteen Slaves, two Freed-men and four of his Friends; theſe rode on Horſeback, but <hi>Cato</hi> always went on Foot, yet would he keep by them, and diſcourſe with them on the way.</p>
            <p>When he came to the Army, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of many Legions, the General gave him the Command of one; but <hi>Cato</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it as a ſmall matter, and not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Commander, to make his own ſingle Valour appear; therefore he deſired to make his Souldiers like himſelf. Yet he did not thereby loſe the Reverence due to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:33760:289"/>
but joyned Reaſon to his Authority; for he perſwaded and inſtructed every one in particular, and on all beſtowed Rewards or Puniſhments according to deſert.</p>
            <p>At length his Men were ſo well diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that it was hard to ſay, whether they were more peaceable, or more warlike; more valiant, or more juſt: they were dreadful to their Enemies, and courteous to their Companions; fearful to do wrong, and forward to gain Honour. Thus <hi>Cato,</hi> tho' he never ſought, yet eaſily acquired Glory and Repute; was highly eſteemed by all men, but entirely beloved by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Whatever he commanded to be done, he himſelf took part in the performing. In his Apparel, his Diet and Labour, he was more like a common Souldier than an Officer; but in Virtue, Courage and Wiſdom, he far exceeded all that had the Name of Commanders. By theſe means he made himſelf greatly beloved, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more willingly followed: for the true love of Virtue, is in all men produced by the Love and Reſpect they bear to him that teaches it; and thoſe who praiſe good men, yet do not love them may cry up their Honour, but will never imitate their Virtue.</p>
            <p>At that time there dwelt in <hi>Pergamum,</hi> one <hi>Athenodorus,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Cordylio,</hi> a Man very
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:33760:289"/>
well verſed in the Stoick Philoſophy, who was now grown old, and had always refuſed the Friendſhip and Acquaintance of Princes and great Men. <hi>Cato</hi> underſtood this; ſo that imagining he ſhould not be able to prevail with him by ſending or writing; and being by the Laws allowed two months abſence from the Army, he reſolved to go into <hi>Aſia,</hi> to ſee <hi>Athenodorus:</hi> and conſidering the great worth of the Man, he hoped he ſhould not loſe his labour. When <hi>Cato</hi> had diſcourſed with him, and perſwaded him from his former Reſolutions, he returned and brought him to the Army, as joyful and as proud of this ſucceſs, as if he had done ſome heroick Exploit, greater than any of thoſe of <hi>Pompey</hi> or <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who at that time ſubdued ſo many Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Cato</hi> was yet in the Army, his Brother, on a Journey toward <hi>Aſia,</hi> fell ſick at <hi>Aenus</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> and immediately diſpatched Letters to him. The Sea was very rough, and no convenient great Veſſel to be had; yet <hi>Cato,</hi> getting into a little Paſſage boat, with only two of his Friends, and three Servants, ſet Sail from <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and having very narrowly eſcaped drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he arrived at <hi>Aenus</hi> juſt as <hi>Coepio</hi> expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Upon this occaſion <hi>Cato</hi> ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more a fond Brother than a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:33760:290"/>
not only in the exceſs of Grief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing and embracing the dead Body, but alſo in the extravagant Expences of the Funeral, wherein a vaſt quantity of rich Perfumes and coſtly Garments were burnt with the Corps? beſides, he erected in the <hi>Forum</hi> of the <hi>Aenians,</hi> a Monument of <hi>Thaſſian</hi> Marble, which coſt eight Talents. This ſome blamed, as not ſuiting with <hi>Cato</hi>'s uſual Moderation in other things: But they did not conſider, that tho' he were ſtedfaſt, firm, and inflexible to Pleaſure, Fear, or fond Entreaties; yet he was full of natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and brotherly Affection. Divers of the Cities and Governours of the Countrey, ſent him many Preſents, to honour the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of his Brother; but he took none of their Money, only the Perfumes and Ornaments he received, and paid for them alſo. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when the Eſtate was divided between him and <hi>Coepio</hi>'s Daughter, he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Funeral Expences to be deducted. Notwithſtanding all this, a certain Writer has affirmed, that he made his Brother's Aſhes be paſſed through a Sieve, to find the Gold that was melted down with the Body: but ſurely that <note n="*" place="margin">He means <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi>
               </note> perſon thought, his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as well as his Actions, ſhould never be ſubject to Examination.</p>
            <p>The Time of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Service in the Army being expired, he received at his departure
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:33760:290"/>
not only the Prayers and Praiſes, but the Tears and Embraces of the Souldiers, who ſpread their Garments at his Feet, and kiſſed his Hand as he paſſed; an Honour, which the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhewed to very few of their Generals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> having left the Army, reſolved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would return home, and apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the management of State-Affairs, to travel over <hi>Aſia,</hi> and there obſerve the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the Cuſtoms, and the Strength of every Province. He was alſo willing to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Importunity of <hi>Deiotarus,</hi> King of <hi>Galatia,</hi> who having had great Familiarity and Friendſhip with his Father, did earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invite him thither.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> took care to order his Journeys in this manner: Early in the morning he ſent out his Baker and his Cook toward the Place where he deſigned to lodge the next night: theſe went civilly and quietly into the Town in which if there happened to be no Friend nor Acquaintance of <hi>Cato</hi> or his Family, they provided for him in an Inn, and gave no diſturbance to any body; but if there were no Inn, they went to the Magiſtrates, and deſired them to help them to Lodgings, and were always ſatisfied with what was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to them. His Servants thus behaving themſelves toward the Magiſtrates, without noiſe and threatning, were often not credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:33760:291"/>
or neglected by them; ſo that <hi>Cato</hi> did many times arrive, before any thing was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him. And indeed he himſelf was often deſpiſed, and made little account of; for ſitting ſilent by himſelf on his Carriages, he was looked upon as a contemptible Man, and one of a mean Spirit; therefore he would ſometimes call the Townſmen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay, <hi>Ye ill-natured Men, lay aſide this inhoſpitable Humour; you ſhould by Courteſie endeavour to break the power of thoſe Men, who deſire but a pretence to take from you by force, what you give with ſuch Reluctance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he travelled in this manner, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Accident befell him in <hi>Syria.</hi> As he was going into <hi>Antioch,</hi> he ſaw a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of People without the Gates, ranked in order on either ſide the way; here the young Men with long Cloaks, there the Children decently dreſs'd; others wore Crowns and white Garments, which were the Prieſts and Magiſtrates. <hi>Cato,</hi> preſently imagining all this was to do him Honour, and for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, began to be angry with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants that were ſent before, for ſuffering it to be done; then making his Friends alight, he walked along with them on Foot. As ſoon as he came near the Gate, a reverend old Man, who ſeemed to be Maſter of theſe Ceremonies, with a Staff and a Crown in his Hand, comes up to <hi>Cato,</hi> and without
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:33760:291"/>
ſhewing him any reſpect, ask'd him, Where he had left <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and how ſoon he thought he would be there? This <hi>Demetrius</hi> was <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s Servant; and by all thoſe who hoped for any Favour from <hi>Pompey,</hi> he was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured, not for his own Deſert, but for his great Power with his Maſter. Upon this <hi>Cato</hi>'s Friends fell out into ſuch a Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they could not reſtrain themſelves, while they paſſed through the Crowd; he himſelf much out of Countenance, cryed, <hi>O unhappy City!</hi> and ſaid no more: yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he uſed to tell this Story, and laugh at it himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> likewiſe after that made the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſhamed of their Ignorance and Folly; for <hi>Cato,</hi> in his Journey to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> went to pay his Reſpects to him; who was the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Man, had gained much Honour, and was then General of a great Army. Yet <hi>Pompey</hi> would not receive him ſitting; but as ſoon as he ſaw him roſe up, and going to meet him, as the more honourable Perſon, gave him his Hand, and embraced him very kindly. He ſaid many things alſo in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Virtue, both in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and when he was gone away. So that now all men began to reſpect <hi>Cato,</hi> and admired him for the ſame things for which they deſpiſed him before; having well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the mildneſs of his Temper, and the
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:33760:292"/>
greatneſs of his Spirit. Moreover, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility that <hi>Pompey</hi> himſelf ſhewed him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to come from one that rather ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, than loved him. For it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he was very kind to <hi>Cato</hi> while he was preſent with him, but very glad when he was gone from him: And when other young men came to ſee him; he uſually importuned and entreated them to continue with him. Now he did not at all invite <hi>Cato</hi> to ſtay; but as if his own Power were leſſened by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Preſence, he very willingly diſmiſs'd him. Yet to <hi>Cato</hi> alone, of all thoſe that went for <hi>Rome,</hi> he recommended his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and his Wife, who was alſo her ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to <hi>Cato.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, all the Cities through which he paſſed, ſtrove and emulated each other in ſhewing him Reſpect and Honour. They invited him to great Entertainments; at which he deſired his Friends to be preſent, and take care of him, leſt he ſhould make good what was ſaid by <hi>Curio;</hi> who tho' he were his familiar Friend, yet diſliking the auſterity of his Temper, asked him one day, If when he left the Army, he deſigned to ſee <hi>Aſia?</hi> And <hi>Cato</hi> anſwering, <hi>Yes, by all means: You do well,</hi> replied <hi>Curio, and I hope you will return thence a litle more ſoftned, and leſs an Enemy to Pleaſure.</hi> Thoſe were his words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="573" facs="tcp:33760:292"/>
               <hi>Deiotarus</hi> being now an old Man, had ſent for <hi>Cato,</hi> with deſign to recommend his Children and Family to his Protection: and as ſoon as he came, brought him Preſents of all ſorts of things, which he begg'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to accept. This ſo diſpleaſed <hi>Cato,</hi> that tho' he came but in the evening, he ſtay'd only that night, and went away early the next morning. After he was gone one days Journey, he found at <hi>Peſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuns</hi> a greater number of Preſents provided for him there, and alſo Letters from <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otarus,</hi> entreating him to receive them; or at leaſt to permit his Friends to take them, who for his ſake deſerved ſomething: And indeed <hi>Cato</hi>'s own Eſtate was not very great; yet he would not ſuffer it, tho' he ſaw ſome of them were willing to receive ſuch Gifts, and ready to complain of his Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But he told them, That at this rate Corruption would never want pretence; and for his Friends, they ſhould ſhare with him in what-ever he could get juſtly and honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo he returned the Preſents to <hi>Deiota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he took Ship for <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> his Friends would have perſwaded him to put his Brother's Aſhes into another Veſſel; but he ſaid, He would ſooner part with his Life than leave them: and ſo he ſet Sail. 'Tis ſaid, he paſſed the Sea not without ſome
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:33760:293"/>
danger; tho' others at the ſame time went over very ſafely.</p>
            <p>After he was returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſpent his Time for the moſt part either at home, in Converſation with <hi>Athenodorus,</hi> or at the <hi>Forum,</hi> in the ſervice of his Friends.</p>
            <p>When the Office of <hi>Quoeſtor</hi> was allotted to him, he would not take the Place, till he had perfectly ſtudied the Laws concerning it, and diligently enquired of experienced Men the Duty and Authority belonging to it. Being thus inſtructed, as ſoon as he came into the Office, he made a great Reformation among the Clerks and under-Officers of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. For they being well verſed in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and Methods of the Office, into which continually ſucceeded new <hi>Quoeſtors,</hi> who for their Ignorance and Unskilfulneſs were fit only to learn, and not able to manage the Buſineſs: Theſe Officers therefore had taken to themſelves all the Power, and were in effect the Treaſurers: Till <hi>Cato,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelf roundly to the Work, had not only the Title and Honour of a <hi>Quoeſtor,</hi> but an inſight and underſtanding of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever belonged to the Office. So that he uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Clerks and under-Officers like Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as they were; reprehending them that were corrupt, and inſtructing thoſe that were Ignorant. Yet being bold, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Fellows, they flattered the other <hi>Quoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi>
               <pb n="575" facs="tcp:33760:293"/>
his Collegues, and by their means made great oppoſition againſt <hi>Cato.</hi> But he caught the chiefeſt of them dealing diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly in the diviſion of an Eſtate, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him out of the Treaſury. A ſecond he accuſed of forging a Will; who was defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Luctatius Catulus,</hi> at that time <hi>Cenſor;</hi> a Man very conſiderable for his Office, but more for his Virtue; and was eminent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all the <hi>Romans</hi> of that Age, for his Wiſdom and Integrity: he had alſo an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Acquaintance with <hi>Cato</hi> and much commended his way of Living. <hi>Catulus,</hi> perceiving he could not bring off his Client, if he ſtood to the iſſue of a fair Trial, fell to Prayers and Entreaties; but <hi>Cato</hi> would not ſuffer him to proceed therein: and when he continued ſtill importunate; <hi>'Tis a ſhame,</hi> (ſaid he to <hi>Catulus</hi>) <hi>that you who are to Judge of our Lives, ſhould thus let your own be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, by defending the Faults of our Servants.</hi> At this expreſſion <hi>Catulus</hi> looked as if he would have made ſome Anſwer; but he ſaid nothing, and either through Anger or Shame went away ſilent, and out of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Nevertheleſs the Man was not caſt; for the Voices that quitted him, were but one in number leſs than thoſe that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him: and <hi>Marcus Lollius,</hi> one of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Collegues, was abſent by reaſon of Sickneſs; to him <hi>Catulus</hi> ſent, and entreated him to
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:33760:294"/>
come and aſſiſt his Client: ſo <hi>Lollius</hi> was brought into Court in a Chair, and gave his Voice alſo for acquitting the Man. Yet <hi>Cato</hi> never after made uſe of that Clerk, and never paid him his Salary, nor would he make any account of that Voice of <hi>Lollius.</hi> Having thus humbled the Clerks, and brought them to be at Command, he made uſe of the Books and Regiſters as he thought fit, and in a little while reduced the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into as good order as any other Court; and all men ſaid, <hi>Cato</hi> had made the Office of a <hi>Quoeſtor</hi> equal to the Dignity of a <hi>Conſul.</hi> When he found many indebted to the State upon old accounts, and the State alſo in Debt to many private Perſons, he took care that the Publick might neither do nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer wrong: for he ſeverely and punctually exacted what was due to the Treaſury; but as freely and ſpeedily paid all thoſe to whom it was indebted. This made the People much reverence <hi>Cato:</hi> when they ſaw thoſe made to pay, who thought to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped for nothing; and others receiving all their due, who deſpaired of getting any thing. Whereas uſually thoſe who brought falſe Bills, aud pretended Orders of Senate, could through Favour get them accepted; <hi>Cato</hi> would never be ſo impoſed upon: And a certain Order being queſtioned whether it had paſſed the Senate, he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:33760:294"/>
a great many Witneſſes that atteſted it, nor did admit of it till the <hi>Conſuls</hi> came and affirmed it upon Oath.</p>
            <p>There were at that time a great many, whom <hi>Sylla</hi> had made uſe of as his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners in the laſt Proſcription, and to whom he had for that Service given twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Drachma's apiece. Theſe men every body hated as wicked Wretches, but no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy durſt be revenged of them. Yet <hi>Cato</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one to account, who had thus got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the publick Money; which he exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them, and at the ſame time ſharply reproved them for their cruel and impious Actions. Having born this from <hi>Cato,</hi> they were preſently accuſed of Murther; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already prejudged as guilty, they were eaſily found ſo, and accordingly ſuffered. At this all People rejoyced, and hoped now to ſee the fear of Tyranny taken away, and <hi>Sylla</hi> himſelf puniſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi>'s Aſſiduity alſo, and indefatigable Diligence, won very much upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for he always came firſt of any of his Collegues to the Treaſury, and went away the laſt. He never miſs'd any Aſſembly of the People, or Sitting of the Senate; where he always took care ſtrictly to obſerve thoſe, who lightly, or out of Ambition, voted for remitting or giving away the Fines and Cuſtoms, that were owing to the State.
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:33760:295"/>
And at length having freed the Exchequer from Informers, yet filled it with Treaſure; he made it appear, the State might be rich, without oppreſſing the People.</p>
            <p>At firſt he was uneaſie and hateful to ſome of his Collegues, but afterward much belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them; for on him they laid the fault, when they could not gratifie their Friends with Penſions out of the Treaſury, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Judgments in paſſing their Accounts; and when preſſed by Suiters, they readily anſwered, 'Twas impoſſible to do any thing, unleſs <hi>Cato</hi> would conſent.</p>
            <p>The laſt day of his Office he was very honourably attended to his Houſe by all the People; but by the way he was informed, that ſeveral Perſons of great Power and Familiarity with <hi>Marcellus,</hi> were about him in the Treaſury, and earneſtly urging him to paſs a certain Gift out of the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, as if it had been a Debt. This <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> had been one of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Friends from his Childhood, and was one of the beſt of his Collegues in this Office; but when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, was eaſily wrought upon by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Suiters, and of his own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation very ready to do any body a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Wherefore <hi>Cato</hi> immediately turned back, and finding that <hi>Marcellus</hi> had yielded to paſs the thing, he took the Book, and razed it out. When he had done this, he
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:33760:295"/>
brought <hi>Marcellus</hi> out of the Court, who went home with him; and for all this, neither then, nor ever after, complained of him, but always continued his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Familiarity with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> after he had laid down his Office, yet did not leave the Care of the Treaſury; for he had his Servants there continually writing out Accounts, and he himſelf kept always by him certain Books, that contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Accounts of the Revenue, from <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Time to his own, for which he gave five Talents.</p>
            <p>He was always firſt at the Senate, and went out laſt; oftentimes while others walked about there idlely, he would ſit and read by himſelf, holding his Gown before his Book, and was never out of Town, when the Senate was to meet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> and his Party finding that <hi>Cato</hi> could never be, either perſwaded or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to favour their unjuſt Deſigns; they contrived to keep him from ſo much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the Senate, by engaging him in Buſineſs for his Friends, either to plead their Cauſes, or arbitrate their Differences. But he quickly diſcovering their Contrivance, to encounter it, fairly told all his Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that he would never meddle in any private Buſineſs, when the Senate was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled; <q>ſince 'twas not for Honour or
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:33760:296"/>
Riches, nor raſhly or by chance, that he engaged himſelf in the Affairs of State; but he undertook the Service of the Publick, as the proper Buſineſs of an honeſt Man: and therefore he thought himſelf obliged to be as diligent for the good of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as a Bee for the preſervation of her Hive.</q> To this end he took care to make his Friends and Correſpondents ſend him the Edicts, Decrees, Judgments, and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Actions that paſſed in any of the Provinces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clodius,</hi> the ſeditious Oratour, practiſing to ſtir up great Commotions, and traducing the Prieſts and Veſtals to the People, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom, <hi>Fabia Terentia,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>'s Wife, run great danger) <hi>Cato</hi> boldly oppoſed him, and made him appear ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, that he was forc'd to leave the Town; and when <hi>Cicero</hi> came to thank him for what he had done; <hi>You muſt thank the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</hi> ſaid he; for whoſe ſake alone it was that he did every thing. Thus he gained a great and wonderful Reputation: ſo that a certain Advocate in a Cauſe, where there was only one Witneſs againſt him, told the Judges, They ought not to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſingle Witneſs, though it were <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf. And it was grown proverbial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People, if any very unlikely and incredible thing were aſſerted, to ſay, <hi>They</hi>
               <pb n="581" facs="tcp:33760:296"/>
               <hi>would not believe it, though</hi> Cato <hi>himſelf ſhould affirm it.</hi> One day a debauched Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal talking in the Senate about Frugality and Temperance, <hi>Amnoeus</hi> ſtanding up, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Who can endure this, Sir, to hear you, that feaſt like</hi> Craſſus, <hi>and build like</hi> Lucullus, <hi>talk like</hi> Cato. So likewiſe thoſe who were wild and diſſolute in their Manners, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to ſeem grave and ſevere in their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, were in deriſion called <hi>Cato's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At firſt when his Friends would have perſwaded him to ſtand to be <hi>Tribune</hi> of the People, he thought it not convenient; for that the Power of ſo great an Office, ought to be imployed only as the ſtrongeſt Medicines, when things are brought to the laſt neceſſity. But afterward in Vacation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, as he was going, accompanied with his Books and Philoſophers, to <hi>Leucania,</hi> where he had a pleaſant Seat; by the way they met a great many Horſes, Carriages, and Attendants, of whom they underſtood, that <hi>Metellus Nepos</hi> was going to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſtand to be <hi>Tribune</hi> of the People. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Cato</hi> ſtopp'd, and after a little pauſe, gave Orders to return immediately: At which the Company ſeeming to wonder; <hi>Don't you know</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>how dangerous of it ſelf the Madneſs of</hi> Metellus <hi>is? but now he comes aſſiſted with the Counſel of</hi> Pompey, <hi>he will fall like Lightning on the State, and bring</hi>
               <pb n="582" facs="tcp:33760:297"/>
               <hi>it to utter ruine: wherefore this is no time for Idleneſs and Diverſion; but we muſt go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this man in his Deſigns, or bravely die in defence of our Liberty.</hi> Nevertheleſs, by the Perſwaſion of his Friends, he went firſt to his Countrey-houſe, where he ſtay'd but a very little time, and then returned to Town.</p>
            <p>He arrived in the Evening, and went ſtraight the next Morning to the <hi>Forum,</hi> where he began to ſollicit for the <hi>Tribuneſhip,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Metellus.</hi> The Power of this Office conſiſts rather in controuling, than performing any Buſineſs; for tho' all the reſt except any one <hi>Tribune</hi> ſhould be agreed, yet his denial or interceſſion could put a ſtop to the whole Matter. <hi>Cato</hi> at firſt had not many that appeared for him; but as ſoon as his Deſign was known, all Perſons of the beſt Quality, and of his own Acquaintance, took part with him; for they looked upon him not as one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Favour of them, but one that ſought to do a great Kindneſs to his Countrey, and all honeſt men: Who had many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the ſame Office, when he might have had it without trouble; but now ſought it with danger, that he might defend their Liberty, and their Government. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that ſo great a number flock'd about him, that he was like to be ſtifled amidſt the Preſs, and could ſcarce get through the
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:33760:297"/>
Crowd. He was declared <hi>Tribune,</hi> with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, among whom was <hi>Metellus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Cato</hi> was choſen into this Office, having obſerved that the Election of <hi>Conſuls</hi> was grown very mercenary, he ſharply rebuked the People for this Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the concluſion of his Speech proteſted, he would accuſe whom ever he ſhould find giving Money: yet Paſſed by <hi>Silanus,</hi> by reaſon of his Alliance, for he had married <hi>Servilia, Cato</hi>'s Siſter; ſo that he did not proſecute him: but <hi>Lucius Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena,</hi> who was choſen <hi>Conſul</hi> with <hi>Silanus,</hi> he accuſed of Bribery. There was a Law, That the Party accuſed might ſet a Guard upon his Accuſer, to watch him leſt he ſhould uſe any indirect means in preparing the Accuſation. He that was ſet upon <hi>Cato</hi> by <hi>Murena,</hi> at firſt followed and obſerved him ſtrictly, yet never found him dealing any way unfairly or unjuſtly, but always generouſly and candidly, going on in the juſt and open Methods of Proceeding. So that he much admired <hi>Cato</hi>'s great Spirit and noble Nature, and eaſily truſted to his Integrity; for meeting him abroad, or going to his Houſe, he would ask him if he deſigned to do any thing that day in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Accuſation; and if <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid, No, he went away, freely relying on his Word.</p>
            <p>When the Cauſe was pleaded, <hi>Cicero,</hi> who
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:33760:298"/>
was then <hi>Conſul,</hi> and defended <hi>Murena,</hi> did ſo wittily expoſe <hi>Cato,</hi> and the Stoick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and their Paradoxes, that he raiſed great Laughter in his Judges. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, <hi>Cato</hi> ſmiling, ſaid to the Standers by <hi>Sirs, we have a very pleaſant</hi> Conſul. <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena</hi> was acquitted, and afterward ſhewed himſelf no paſſionate, but a very prudent Man; for when he was <hi>Conſul,</hi> he always took <hi>Cato</hi>'s Advice in the moſt weighty Affairs, and in all the time of his Office, gave him much Honour and Reſpect. Of which, not only <hi>Murena</hi>'s Prudence, but alſo <hi>Cato</hi>'s obliging Humour, was the Cauſe: for tho' he were terrible and ſevere, as to Matters of Juſtice, in the Senate and at the Bar; yet he was very courteous and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natured to all men in private.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Cato</hi> took upon him the Office of <hi>Tribune,</hi> he aſſiſted <hi>Cicero,</hi> at that time <hi>Conſul,</hi> in many things that concerned his Office; but moſt eſpecially in proſecuting <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Conſpiracy, which he did with great Courage and Succeſs.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Catiline</hi> had plotted a dreadful and entire Subverſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> State, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving to raiſe great Seditions, and drive them into a Civil War; but being detected by <hi>Cicero,</hi> was forced to fly the City. Yet <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Cethegus</hi> conſpired with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others, and blaming <hi>Catiline,</hi> as one
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:33760:298"/>
that wanted Courage, and had too much Caution for ſuch deſperate Deſigns, they themſelves reſolved to ſet the whole Town on fire, and utterly to ruine the Empire of the World, by Tumults at home, and War from abroad. But the Deſign was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Cicero,</hi> (as we have written in his Life) and the Matter brought before the Senate. <hi>Silanus,</hi> who ſpoke firſt, delivered his opinion, <hi>That the Conſpirators ought to ſuffer the laſt of Puniſhments;</hi> and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in followed by all that ſpoke after him, till it came to <hi>Coeſar</hi> who was very eloquent, and looking upon all Changes and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the State, as Matter for him to work upon, deſired rather to increaſe than extinguiſh them. Wherefore ſtanding up, he made a very merciful and perſwaſive Speech; <hi>That they ought not to ſuffer other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than according to Law, by which they could not be put to death;</hi> and moved that they might be kept in Priſon: Thus was the Houſe almoſt wholly turned by <hi>Coeſar.</hi> They were alſo afraid of the People; inſomuch that <hi>Silanus</hi> retracted, and ſaid <hi>he did not mean Death, but Impriſonment, for that was the utmoſt of what a</hi> Roman <hi>could ſuffer.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this they were all inclined to the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er opinion; when <hi>Cato</hi> ſtanding up, began to ſpeak with great Paſſion and Eloquence; <hi>blaming</hi> Silanus <hi>for his change of Opinion, and</hi>
               <pb n="586" facs="tcp:33760:299"/>
               <hi>reflecting on</hi> Caeſar <hi>for his affectation of Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, who</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>would ruine the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by mild words, and plauſible ſpeeches: yet endeavoured to frighten the Senate, where he himſelf ought to fear: for he might take it kindly, if he eſcaped unpuniſhed, or unſuſpected, who did thus openly and boldly dare to protect the Enemies of the State; ſeemed to have no compaſſion for ſo great and glorious an Empire, brought ſo near its utter ruine; yet was full of pity for thoſe men, who had better never been born, and whoſe death muſt deliver the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth from danger and deſtruction.</hi> This only of all <hi>Cato</hi>'s Speeches, 'tis ſaid, was preſerved; for <hi>Cicero</hi> the <hi>Conſul</hi> had diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about the Senate houſe ſeveral expert Writers, whom he had taught to make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain figures, which did in little and ſhort ſtrokes expreſs a great many words: till that time they had not uſed thoſe we call Short-hand Writers, who then firſt, as 'tis ſaid, laid the foundation of that Art. Thus <hi>Cato</hi> carried it, and ſo turned the Houſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that it was decreed, The Conſpirators ſhould be put to death.</p>
            <p>Not to omit any the leaſt ſtrokes that may ſhew <hi>Cato</hi>'s Temper, and contribute to draw the Image of his Mind; it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that while <hi>Coeſar</hi> and he were diſputing very earneſtly in this Buſineſs, and the whole Senate regarding them two, a little
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:33760:299"/>
Note was brought in to <hi>Coeſar;</hi> which <hi>Cato</hi> preſently declared to be ſuſpicious; and ſome of the Senators moved it might be read. Whereupon <hi>Coeſar</hi> delivered the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Cato,</hi> who diſcovering it to be a Love letter from his Siſter <hi>Servilia</hi> to <hi>Coeſar,</hi> by whom ſhe had been debauched, he threw it to him again, crying, <hi>Take it, you Sot;</hi> and ſo went on with his Diſcourſe. In ſhort, it ſeems <hi>Cato</hi> had but ill Fortune in Women; for this Lady was ill-ſpoken of, for her Familiarity with <hi>Coeſar:</hi> and another <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilia, Cato</hi>'s Siſter alſo, was yet more infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; for being married to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> one of the greateſt Men in <hi>Rome;</hi> and having brought him a Son, ſhe was afterward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced for Incontinency. But what was worſt of all, <hi>Cato</hi>'s own Wife, <hi>Atilia,</hi> was not free from the ſame Fault; and after ſhe had born him two Children, he was forc'd to put her away for her ill Conduct. After that he married <hi>Martia,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Philip,</hi> a Woman of good Reputation; who yet has occaſioned much Diſcourſe; for this Paſſage in the Life of <hi>Cato</hi> looks like a Fable in a Play, and is very difficult to be cleared, or made out with any certainty.</p>
            <p>It is thus related by <hi>Thraſeas,</hi> who refers to the Authority of <hi>Munatius, Cato</hi>'s Friend and conſtant Companion. Among many that loved and admired <hi>Cato,</hi> ſome were

more remarkable and conſpicuous than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: of theſe was <hi>Quintus Hortenſius,</hi> a Man of ſignal Worth, and approved Virtue; who deſired not only to live in Friendſhip and Familiarity with <hi>Cato,</hi> but alſo to be united to his Family, by ſome Alliance in Marriage. Therefore he ſet himſelf to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>Cato,</hi> that his Daughter <hi>Porcia,</hi> who was already married to <hi>Bibulus,</hi> and had born him two Children, might nevertheleſs be given to him, as a fruitful Field, from which he might raiſe an Off-ſpring: <hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>tho' this in the opinion of men may ſeem ſtrange, yet in Nature 'twould be honeſt and profitable for the Publick; that a Woman in the prime of her youth ſhould not lie uſeleſs, and loſe the Fruit of her Womb; nor on the the other ſide would it be convenient, ſhe ſhould burthen and impoveriſh one Man, by bringing him too many Children. Alſo by this Communication of Families among worthy Men, Virtue would increaſe, and be diffuſed through their Poſterity; and the Common-wealth would be united and cemented by their Alliances. Yet if</hi> Bibulus <hi>would not part with his Wife altogether, he would reſtore her as ſoon as ſhe had brought him a Child, whereby he might be united to both their Families. Cato</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That he loved</hi> Hortenſius <hi>very well, and did much approve of uniting their Houſes; but he thought it very ſtrange to ſpeak of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying</hi>
               <pb n="589" facs="tcp:33760:301"/>
               <hi>his Daughter, which was already given to another.</hi> Then <hi>Hortenſius,</hi> turning the Diſcourſe, did not ſtick to acknowledge, that 'twas <hi>Cato</hi>'s own Wife which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; for ſhe was young and fruitful, and he had already Children enough. Neither can it be thought, that <hi>Hortenſius</hi> did this, as imagining <hi>Cato</hi> did not love <hi>Martia;</hi> for, 'tis ſaid, ſhe was then with Child. <hi>Cato</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his earneſt deſire, did not deny his Requeſt, but ſaid, that <hi>Philip,</hi> the Father of <hi>Martia,</hi> ought alſo to be conſulted. <hi>Philip</hi> therefore being ſent for, came; and finding they were well agreed, gave his Daughter <hi>Martia</hi> to <hi>Hortenſius</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Cato,</hi> who himſelf alſo aſſiſted at the Marriage. Theſe things were done afterward; but ſince I was ſpeaking of Women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I thought fit to make mention thereof in this Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lentulus</hi> and the reſt of the Conſpirators were put to death; but <hi>Coeſar,</hi> by reaſon of what was ſaid againſt him in the Senate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to the People, and ſtirred up the moſt corrupt and diſſolute Members of the State to follow him. <hi>Cato,</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of what might enſue thereupon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Senate to win over the poor and diſorderly Rabble, by a diſtribution of Corn, the Charge of which amounted to twelve hundred and fifty Talents. This Liberality did in appearance diſſipate the preſent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="590" facs="tcp:33760:302"/>But <hi>Metellus,</hi> coming into his Office of <hi>Tribune,</hi> began to hold tumultuous Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and had prepared a Decree, That <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great ſhould preſently be called into <hi>Italy,</hi> with all his Forces, to preſerve the City from the danger of <hi>Catiline</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy. This was the fair pretence; but the true deſign was, to deliver all into the hands of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and give him an abſolute Power. Upon this the Senate was aſſembled; and <hi>Cato</hi> did not fall ſharply upon <hi>Metellus,</hi> as he uſed to do, but ſpoke many things full of great Reaſon and Moderation. At laſt he deſcended even to Entreaty, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled the Houſe of <hi>Metellus,</hi> as having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways taken part with the Nobility. At this <hi>Metellus</hi> grew the more inſolent, and deſpiſing <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to,</hi> as if he yielded and were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, let fall many audacious Speeches, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly threatning to do whatever he pleaſed in ſpite of the Senate. Hereupon <hi>Cato</hi> changed his Countenance, his Voice and his Language; and after many ſharp Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, boldly concluded, <hi>That while he lived,</hi> Pompey <hi>ſhould never come armed into the City.</hi> The Senate thought them both extravagant, and not well in their Wits; for the Deſign of <hi>Metellus</hi> ſeemed to be the effect of his Rage, who out of exceſs of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, would bring all to Ruine and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; and <hi>Cato</hi>'s Virtue look'd like a kind
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:33760:302"/>
of Ecſtaſie, while he with ſo great heat and paſſion contended for what was good and juſt. Afterward, when the People were to give their Voices for the paſſing this Decree, <hi>Metellus</hi> before-hand poſſeſſed the <hi>Forum</hi> with armed Men, Strangers, Gladiators and Slaves, and all thoſe that in hopes of Change followed <hi>Pompey,</hi> which was no ſmall part of the People; beſides they had great Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from <hi>Coeſar,</hi> who was then <hi>Proetor.</hi> The beſt and chiefeſt Men of the City, were no leſs offended at theſe Proceedings than <hi>Cato;</hi> but they ſeemed rather likely to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with him, than able to aſſiſt him. In the mean time <hi>Cato</hi>'s whole Family were in dreadful Fear and Apprehenſion for him; ſome of his Friends did neither eat nor ſleep all the night, continuing in very great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity: his Wife and Siſters alſo bewailed and lamented him; but he himſelf, void of all Fear, and full of Aſſurance, did comfort and encourage them by his own Diſcourſe. After Supper he went to reſt at his uſual hour, and was the next day waked out of a profound Sleep, by <hi>Minutius Thermus,</hi> one of his Collegues. So ſoon as he was up, they two went together into the <hi>Forum,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by very few, but met by a great many, who bid them have a care of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Cato,</hi> when he ſaw the Temple of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> incompaſſed with armed
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:33760:303"/>
Men, and the aſcent to it guarded by Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, at the top whereof ſate <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> together; turning to his Friends, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that couragious Fellow who has raiſed ſo great Forces againſt one unarmed naked man:</hi> and ſo he went on with <hi>Thermus.</hi> They who kept the Paſſages, gave way to thoſe two; but would not let any body elſe paſs: yet <hi>Cato,</hi> taking <hi>Munatius</hi> by the Hand, with much difficulty pull'd him thorow along with him. Then going di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he ſate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down between them, to prevent their talking to one another; at which they were both amazed. And thoſe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Party, obſerving the Countenance and admiring the Spirit and Boldneſs of <hi>Cato,</hi> went nearer, and cry'd out to him to have Courage, exhorting one another to ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and not betray their Liberty, nor the Defender of it. Then the Clerk took out the Bill, but <hi>Cato</hi> forbade him to read it; whereupon <hi>Metellus</hi> took it, and would have read it himſelf, but <hi>Cato</hi> ſnatch'd away the Book. Yet <hi>Metellus</hi> having the Decree by heart, began to recite it without book; but <hi>Thermus</hi> clapp'd his Hand to his Mouth, and ſtopp'd his Speech. <hi>Metellus</hi> ſeeing them fully bent to withſtand him, and the People inclining to their ſide, ſent to his Houſe for armed Men; who ruſhing in with great noiſe

and terrour, they all diſpers'd and run away, except <hi>Cato,</hi> who alone ſtood ſtill, while the other Party threw Sticks and Stones at him from below. <hi>Murena,</hi> whom he had formerly accuſed, could not brook this, but came to him, and holding his Gown before him, cryed out to them to leave off throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ine, perſwading and pulling him along, he forc'd him into the Temple of <hi>Caſter</hi> and <hi>Pollux. Metellus</hi> now ſeeing the Place clear, and all the adverſe Party fled out of the <hi>Forum,</hi> thought he might eaſily carry his Point ſo he commanded the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to retire, and going orderly to work, he began to proceed in paſſing the Decree: But the other ſide, having recollected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, returned very boldly, and with great ſhouting; inſomuch that <hi>Metellus</hi> his Adherents were utterly diſmayed, and fled every one out of the Place. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus diſperſed, <hi>Cato</hi> came in again, and confirmed the Courage, and commended the Reſolution of the People; ſo that now the Multitude were, by all means, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>Metellus</hi> from his Office. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate alſo being preſently aſſembled, gave Orders to ſtand by <hi>Cato,</hi> and to oppoſe this Decree, which would certainly raiſe great Diſturbance, and perhaps Civil War in the Common wealth. But <hi>Metellus</hi> continued ſtill very bold and reſolute; and ſeeing his

Party ſtood greatly in fear of <hi>Cato,</hi> whom they look'd upon as invincible, he flung out of the Senate, and going into the <hi>Forum</hi> he aſſembled the People to whom he made a bitter and invidious Speech againſt <hi>Cate,</hi> crying out, <hi>He was forc'd to fly from his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and this Conſpiracy againſt</hi> Pompey, <hi>that the City would ſoon repent their having diſhonoured ſo great a Man.</hi>

               <hi>Cato</hi> was highly magnified, for having thus delivered the State, from the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Tribuneſhip</hi> of <hi>Metellus;</hi> and thereby in ſome meaſure diminiſhed the Power of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey:</hi> But he was more commended, for that the Senate intending to diſgrace <hi>Metellus,</hi> and depoſe him from his Office, <hi>Cato</hi> did altogether oppoſe, and at length divert that Deſign. For which the Common People ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired his Moderation and Humanity, in not inſulting on an Enemy whom he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; but wiſe Men acknowledged his Prudence and Policy, in not exaſperating <hi>Pompey.</hi>

            <p>After this, <hi>Lucullus</hi> returned from the War in <hi>Aſia;</hi> the finiſhing of which, and thereby the Glory of the whole, would in all appearance fall to <hi>Pompey.

Enmity to <hi>Lucullus.</hi> But <hi>Cate,</hi> being related to <hi>Lucullus</hi> who had married his Siſter <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilia,</hi> and alſo thinking this deſign very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, oppoſed <hi>Memmius;</hi> and thereby under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went many Slanders and falſe Accuſations; inſomuch that they would have turned him out of his Office, pretending that he uſed his Power tyrannically. Yet at length <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> ſo far prevailed againſt <hi>Memmius,</hi> that he was forc'd to let fall the Accuſations, and to deſiſt from his Deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucullus,</hi> having thus obtained his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, did yet more carefully cultivate <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s Friendſhip, which he look'd upon as a great guard and defence againſt <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great alſo returning from the Army, and conſiding in the Glory of his Actions, and the Good-will of the People, thought he ſhould be denied nothing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent to the Senate, to put off the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly for the choice of <hi>Conſuls,</hi> till he could be preſent, to aſſiſt <hi>Piſo,</hi> who ſtood for that Office. To this moſt of the Senate preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yielded; only <hi>Cato,</hi> not thinking that this delay would be of any great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but deſiring to leſſen and cut off the Hopes and Deſigns of <hi>Pompey,</hi> withſtood his Requeſt, and ſo over-ruled the Senate, that 'twas carried againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="596" facs="tcp:33760:305"/>This did not a little trouble <hi>Pompey,</hi> who found he ſhould very often fail in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, unleſs he could bring over <hi>Cato</hi> to his Intereſt. Therefore he ſent for his Friend <hi>Munatius;</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> having two Neeces that were marriageable, he offered to marry the eldeſt himſelf, and take the youngeſt for his Son. Some ſay, they were not his Neeces, but his Daughters, whom <hi>Pompey</hi> would have thus married. <hi>Munatius</hi> propoſed the Matter to <hi>Cato,</hi> in preſence of his Wife and Siſters: the Women very much deſired the Alliance of ſo great and worthy a Perſon; but <hi>Cato,</hi> without delay or balancing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently anſwered; <hi>Go,</hi> Munatius, <hi>go tell</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, <hi>that</hi> Cato <hi>is not to be wrought upon by Women; tho' otherwiſe I very much value his Kindneſs: And while he deals uprightly in the State, he ſhall find in me a Friendſhip more firm than any Alliance; but I will not give Hoſtages to</hi> Pompey's <hi>Glory, againſt my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey's ſafety.</hi> This Anſwer was very grating to the Women; and to all his Friends it ſeemed ſomewhat harſh and haughty. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when <hi>Pompey,</hi> endeavouring to get the <hi>Conſulſhip</hi> for one of his Friends, did give Money to the People for their Voices; and the Bribery was notorious, for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was told out in <hi>Pompey</hi>'s own Gardens. <hi>Cato</hi> then ſaid to the Women, They muſt neceſſarily have been concerned in theſe
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:33760:305"/>
Faults of <hi>Pompey,</hi> if they had been allied to his Family; and they acknowledged, that he did beſt in refuſing it.</p>
            <p>But, if we may judge by the Event, <hi>Cato</hi> ſeems much to blame for rejecting that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, which thereby fell to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And then that Match was made, which uniting his and <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Power, had well-nigh ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and did at laſt utterly deſtroy the Commonwealth. Nothing of which perhaps had come to paſs, but that <hi>Cato</hi> was too apprehenſive of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s leaſt Faults; and did not conſider, how he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him into a condition of committing much greater; however theſe things were yet to come.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> had a great Diſpute, concerning what had been eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Pontus;</hi> each endeavouring that his own Ordinances might ſtand. <hi>Cato</hi> took part with <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who was apparently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured; and <hi>Pompey,</hi> finding himſelf the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the Senate, took to the People. To gain them, he propoſed a Law, for dividing the Lands among the Souldiers: <hi>Cato</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him in this alſo, made the Law be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. Hereupon <hi>Pompey</hi> joyned himſelf with <hi>Clodius,</hi> at that time the moſt violent of all the popular Men; and was likewiſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to <hi>Caeſar</hi> upon this occaſion, of which <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf was the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="598" facs="tcp:33760:306"/>For <hi>Caeſar,</hi> returning from his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Spain,</hi> at the ſame time ſued to be choſen <hi>Conſul,</hi> and yet deſired not to loſe his Triumph. Now the Law requiring, That thoſe who ſtood for any Office, ſhould be preſent; and yet that whoever expected a Triumph, ſhould continue without the Walls; <hi>Caeſar</hi> requeſted the Senate, that his Friends might be permitted to canvaſs for him in his abſence. Many of the Senators where willing to conſent to it; but <hi>Cato</hi> oppoſed it; and perceiving them inclined, to favour <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſpent the whole day in ſpeaking; and ſo prevented the Senate, that they could come to no concluſion. <hi>Caeſar</hi> therefore reſolving to let fall his Pretenſions to the Triumph, came into the Town, and immediately made a Friendſhip with <hi>Pompey,</hi> and ſtood for the <hi>Conſulſhip:</hi> ſo ſoon as he was declared <hi>Conſul</hi> elect, he married his Daughter <hi>Julia</hi> to <hi>Pompey.</hi> Having thus combined themſelves together againſt the Commonwealth, the one propoſed the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grarian</hi> Laws, for dividing the Lands among the poor People; and the other was preſent to ſecond the Propoſal. Againſt them, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus, Cicero,</hi> and their Friends, joyned with <hi>Bibulus</hi> the other <hi>Conſul,</hi> and did all they could to hinder the paſſing thoſe Laws. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe none was more remarkable than <hi>Cato,</hi> who look'd upon the Friendſhip and
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:33760:306"/>
Alliance of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> as very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; and declared, he did not ſo much diſlike the Advantage, the People ſhould get by this diviſion of the Lands, as he fear'd the Reward theſe men would gain, by thus cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People. And in this the Senate was of his opinion; as likewiſe many honeſt men without, who were very much offended at <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ill Conduct; That he now bearing the Authority of <hi>Conſul,</hi> ſhould thus baſely and diſhonourably flatter the People, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to win them by the ſame means, that were wont to be uſed only by the moſt raſh and heady <hi>Tribunes. Caeſar</hi> therefore and his Party, fearing they ſhould not carry it by fair dealing, fell to open force. Firſt a Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of Dung was thrown upon <hi>Bibulus,</hi> as he was going to the <hi>Forum:</hi> then they ſet upon his <hi>Lictors,</hi> and broke their Rods; at length ſeveral Darts were thrown, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men wounded: ſo that all that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Laws, fled out of the <hi>Forum,</hi> the reſt making what haſt they could; but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> laſt of all walking out very ſlowly, often turned back and curſed thoſe Citizens.</p>
            <p>Now the other Party did not only carry this Point of dividing the Lands; but alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that all the Senate ſhould ſwear to confirm this Law, and to defend it againſt whoever ſhould attempt to alter it; inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Penalties on thoſe that ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe

the Oath. All the Senators, ſeeing the neceſſity they were in, took the Oath; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the Example of old <hi>Metellus,</hi> who refuſing to ſwear upon the like occaſion, was forc'd to fly out of <hi>Italy.</hi> As for <hi>Cato,</hi> his Wife and Children with Tears beſought him; his Friends and Familiars perſwaded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to yield, and take the Oath; but he that principally prevailed with him, was <hi>Cicero</hi> the Orator, who urged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, <hi>How unreaſonable it was, that a private man alone ſhould oppoſe what the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick had decreed: That the thing being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paſt remedy, it would look like folly and madneſs, to run himſelf into danger, where 'tis impoſſible to do his Countrey any good. Beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, it would be the greateſt of all Evils, to abandon the Commonwealth, for whoſe ſake he did every thing, and to let it fall into the hands of thoſe, who deſigned nothing but its ruine. This would look, as if he were glad of an opportunity, to retire from the trouble of defending his Countrey: For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>tho</hi>' Cato <hi>have no need of</hi> Rome, <hi>yet</hi> Rome <hi>has need of</hi> Cato; <hi>and ſo likewiſe have all his Friends.</hi> Of whom <hi>Cicero</hi> profeſs'd himſelf the chief; being at that time aimed at by <hi>Clodius,</hi> who openly threatned to fall upon him, as ſoon as ever he ſhould get to be <hi>Tribune.</hi> Thus <hi>Cato</hi> (they ſay) moved by the Entreaties of his Family, and the Perſuaſions
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:33760:308"/>
of his Friends, went unwillingly to take the Oath; which he did the laſt of all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept only <hi>Favonius,</hi> one of his intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coeſar,</hi> exalted with this Succeſs, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed another Law, for dividing almoſt all the Countrey of <hi>Campania</hi> among the poor and needy Citizens. No body durſt ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it but <hi>Cato,</hi> whom therefore <hi>Coeſar</hi> pull'd from the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> and dragg'd to Priſon: yet <hi>Cato</hi> did not at all remit his freedom of Speech, but as he went along, continued to ſpeak againſt the Law, and adviſed the People to put a ſtop to theſe Proceedings. The Senate and the beſt of the Citizens fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him with ſad and dejected Looks, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Grief and Indignation by their Silence; ſo that <hi>Coeſar</hi> could not be ignorant how much they were offended; but being one of a fierce contentious Spirit, he ſtill perſiſted, expecting <hi>Cato</hi> ſhould either ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate him, or appeal to the People. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when he ſaw that <hi>Cato</hi> would do neither, <hi>Coeſar</hi> himſelf, aſham'd of what he had done, privately ſent one of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> to take him out of Priſon.</p>
            <p>Thus having won the Multitude by theſe Laws and Gratifications, they decreed, That <hi>Coeſar</hi> ſhould have the Government of <hi>Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum,</hi> and all <hi>Gaule,</hi> with an Army of four Legions, for the ſpace of five years: Tho'
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:33760:309"/>
               <hi>Cato</hi> ſtill cry'd out, they were placing a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in their Citadel. <hi>Publius Clodius,</hi> (who illegally of a <hi>Patrician</hi> became a <hi>Plebeian</hi>) was declared <hi>Tribune</hi> of the People: And he had promiſed to do all things according to their pleaſure, on condition he might baniſh <hi>Cicero.</hi> For <hi>Conſuls,</hi> they ſet up <hi>Calpurnius Piſo,</hi> the Father of <hi>Coeſar</hi>'s Wife; and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Gabinius,</hi> a Man wholly at <hi>Pompey</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as they Write who beſt knew his Life and Manners.</p>
            <p>Yet when they had thus firmly eſtabliſhed all things; having maſtered one part of the City by Favour, and the other by Fear, they themſelves were ſtill afraid of <hi>Cato:</hi> For they well conſidered, with how much pains and difficulty they had oppreſſed him; and what diſgrace they ſuffered, when they did violence to him. This made <hi>Clodius</hi> deſpair of driving <hi>Cicero</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> while <hi>Cato</hi> ſtay'd at home. Therefore, having firſt laid his Deſign; as ſoon as he came into his Office, he ſent for <hi>Cato,</hi> and told him, <hi>That he look'd upon him as the moſt uncorrupt Man of all the</hi> Romans, <hi>and was ready by deeds to make good the truth of his words: For whereas</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>many have ſought to command the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to</hi> Cyprus, <hi>and have much ſollicited to be ſent thither; I think you only deſerve it, and therefore to you I will freely give that Command. Cato</hi> preſently cry'd out, <hi>This</hi>
               <pb n="603" facs="tcp:33760:309"/>
               <hi>was a deſign upon him, and no Favour, but an Injury.</hi> Then <hi>Clodius</hi> proudly and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered, <hi>If you will not take it as a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet you ſhall go, tho' never ſo unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and</hi> immediately going into the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the People, he made them paſs a Decree, that <hi>Cato</hi> ſhould be ſent to <hi>Cyprus.</hi> But they ordered him neither Ships, nor Souldiers, nor any Officers, only two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries; one of which was a very Raſcal, and the other a Retainer to <hi>Clodius.</hi> Beſides, as if the gaining of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and conquering <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> were not Work ſufficient, he was ordered alſo to reſtore the Fugitives of <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantium:</hi> For <hi>Clodius</hi> was reſolved to keep him far enough off, whilſt himſelf continued <hi>Tribune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato,</hi> being in this neceſſity of going away, adviſed <hi>Cicero,</hi> (who was next to be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to make no Reſiſtance, leſt he ſhould throw the State into Civil War and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but to give way to the Times: And thus he might become once more the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of his Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> ſent <hi>Canidius,</hi> one of his Friends, to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to perſwade <hi>Ptolemy</hi> to yield, without being forc'd; which if he did, he ſhould want neither Riches nor Honour: For the <hi>Romans</hi> would give him the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Venus</hi> in the Iſle of Paphos. He himſelf ſtay'd at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> making ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:33760:310"/>
and expecting an Anſwer from <hi>Cyprus.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who had left <hi>Alexandria,</hi> upon ſome quarrel between him and his Subjects, was ſailing for <hi>Rome,</hi> in hopes that <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Coeſar</hi> would by their Power reſtore him again to his Kingdom: in his way he deſired to ſee <hi>Cato,</hi> to whom he ſent, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he would come to him. <hi>Cato</hi> was about his neceſſary Affairs, when the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger came; to whom he made Anſwer, That <hi>Ptolemy</hi> might come to him, if he thought fit. When he came, <hi>Cato</hi> neither went forward to meet him, nor ſo much as roſe up to him, but ſaluting him as an ordinary Perſon, bid him ſit down. This at firſt amazed <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> who admired to ſee ſuch Greatneſs and ſtately Carriage, in a Man of common Birth and mean Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: But afterward, when he began to talk about his affairs, <hi>Ptolemy</hi> no leſs wonder'd at the Wiſdom and freedom of his Diſcourſe; for <hi>Cato</hi> blamed his Deſign, and ſhew'd him the Honour and Happineſs he had fallen from, the Diſgrace and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles he would run himſelf into; told him, what great Gifts and Preſents he muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on the leading Men at <hi>Rome,</hi> whom all <hi>Aegypt</hi> turn'd into Silver would ſcarcely ſatisfie; he therefore adviſed him to return home, and be reconciled to his Subjects,
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:33760:310"/>
offering to go along with him, and aſſiſt him in compoſing the Differences. Upon this Diſcourſe <hi>Ptolemy</hi> came to himſelf, as one recovered from a Fit of Madneſs; and acknowledging the Wiſdom and Sincerity of <hi>Cato,</hi> was reſolved to follow his Advice: But he was again over-perſwaded by his Friends to the contrary, and ſo according to his firſt Deſign, went to <hi>Rome.</hi> When he came there, and was forced to wait at the Gate of one of the Magiſtrates; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to repent of his folly, in having reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Counſel of ſo good a Man, or rather the Oracle of a God.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the other <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> that was in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> (very luckily for <hi>Cato</hi>) poyſon'd himſelf. It was reported he had left great Riches; therefore <hi>Cato</hi> deſigning to go firſt to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> ſent his Nephew <hi>Brutus</hi> to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> for he would not wholly truſt <hi>Canidius.</hi> Then having reconciled the Fugitives and the People of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> he left the City in peace and quietneſs; and thence ſail'd to <hi>Cyprus;</hi> where he found a Royal Treaſure in Plate, Tables, precious Stones and purple, all which was to be turn'd into ready Money. <hi>Cato</hi> reſolved to examine all very exactly, and to raiſe the price of every thing to the utmoſt; to which end he was always preſent at ſelling the things, and took the Accounts himſelf.
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:33760:311"/>
Nor would he truſt to the uſual Cuſtoms of the Market, but ſuſpected all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Cryers, Prizers, and even his own Friends: therefore he himſelf talk'd with the Buyers, and urged them to bid up; ſo that moſt of the things were ſold at great Rates.</p>
            <p>This Miſtruſtfulneſs of <hi>Cato</hi>'s offended moſt of his Friends; but eſpecially <hi>Munati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the moſt intimate of them all, became almoſt irreconcilable. And this afforded <hi>Caeſar</hi> a plentiful Subject for Railing, in his Book againſt <hi>Cato.</hi> Yet <hi>Munatius</hi> himſelf relates, that this falling out was not ſo much occaſioned by <hi>Cato</hi>'s miſtruſt, as by his neglect of him, and by his own jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Canidius:</hi> for <hi>Munatius</hi> writ a Book concerning <hi>Cato,</hi> which is chiefly follow'd by <hi>Thraſeas.</hi> Now <hi>Munatius</hi> ſays, That coming laſt to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and having a very ill Lodging provided for him, he thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on went to <hi>Cato</hi>'s Houſe, but was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauſe he was in private with <hi>Canidius;</hi> of which he afterward very mildly complain'd to <hi>Cato,</hi> but received a very harſh Anſwer: for he told him, <hi>That too much Love</hi> (<hi>according to</hi> Theophraſtus) <hi>often cauſes Hatred; and you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you bear me much Love, think you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive too little Honour, and preſently grow an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: but as to</hi> Canidius, <hi>I will imploy him,</hi>

               </hi> Theſe things were ſaid in private between them two: but <hi>Cato</hi> afterward told <hi>Canidius</hi> what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which <hi>Munatius</hi> underſtanding, would no more go to ſup with him, and when he was called to Council, refuſed to come.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward when <hi>Cato</hi> was come back alſo, <hi>Martia,</hi> who as yet lived with him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to have them both invited to ſup to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the Houſe of one <hi>Barca: Cato</hi> came in laſt of all, when the reſt were at Table, and ask'd, Where he ſhould be? <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> anſwered him, Where he pleaſed: then looking about, he ſaid, He would be near <hi>Munatius,</hi> and preſently went, and placed himſelf next to him; yet he ſhewed him no other mark of Kindneſs, all the time they were at Table together. But another time, at the Entreaty of <hi>Martia, Cato</hi> wrote to <hi>Munatius,</hi> That he deſired to ſpeak with him. <hi>Munatius</hi> went to his Houſe one Morning, and was entertained by <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> till all the Company was gone; then <hi>Cato</hi> came and embraced him very kindly,

and they were perfectly reconciled. I have the more fully related this Paſſage, for that I think the Manners and Tempers of Men, are more clearly diſcovered by things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than by great and illuſtrious Actions.</p>

               <hi>Cato</hi> got together no leſs than ſeven thouſand Talents of Silver; but apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of what might happen in ſo long a Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by Sea, he provided a great many Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that held two Talents, and five hundred Drachma's apiece: to each of theſe he faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a long Rope, and to the other end of the Rope a piece of Cork; ſo that, if the Ship ſhould miſcarry, it might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered where about the Cheſts lay under Water: thus all the Money, except a very little, was ſafely tranſported. Now <hi>Cato</hi> had made two Books, in which all his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts were carefully written; but neither of them was preſerved; for his Freed-man <hi>Phylargyrus,</hi> who had the charge of one of them, ſetting Sayl from <hi>Cenohrea,</hi> was drowned, together with the Ship, and all her Lading. The other Book <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf kept till he came to <hi>Corcyra;</hi> where he ſee up his Tents in the Market-place: and the Mariners being very cold in the Night, made a great many Fires, ſome of which took hold of the Tents, ſo that they were burnt, and the Book loſt. Though <hi>Cato</hi> had brought with him ſeveral of <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:33760:312"/>
Servants, who could teſtifie his Integrity, and ſtop the mouths of his Enemies; yet this loſs troubled him: for he deſigned them not only for a proof of his own Fidelity, but a pattern of Exactneſs to others.</p>
            <p>News being brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Cato</hi> was coming up the River, all the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, the Prieſts, and the whole Senate, with great part of the People, went out to meet him: both the Banks of the <hi>Tyber</hi> were covered with People: ſo that his Entrance was in Solemnity and Honour, not inferiour to a Triumph. But 'twas thought ſomewhat ſtrange, and look'd like Pride; that when the <hi>Conſuls</hi> and <hi>Praetors</hi> appeared, he did not come toward them, nor ſtay to ſalute them, but rowed up the Stream in a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Galley of ſix Banks of Oars, and ſtopt not till he came to the place of Landing. However, when the Money was carried through the Streets, the People much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the vaſt quantity of it, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate being aſſembled, did in honourable terms decree him an extraordinary <hi>Praetor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and alſo the priviledge of being at the publick ſhews in a Robe fac'd with purple. <hi>Cato</hi> refuſed all theſe Honours: but decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what Diligence and Fidelity he had found in <hi>Nicias,</hi> the Steward of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> he requeſted the Senate to give him his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="610" facs="tcp:33760:313"/>
               <hi>Philip,</hi> the Father of <hi>Martia,</hi> was that year <hi>Conſul;</hi> but the Authority and Power of the Office reſted wholly in <hi>Cato:</hi> for the other <hi>Conſul</hi> no leſs reſpected him for his Vertue, than <hi>Philip</hi> did for his Alliance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cicero</hi> being returned from his Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (into which he was Driven by <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>) and having again obtained great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit among the People; he went one day, in the abſence of <hi>Clodius,</hi> and by force took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Records of his <hi>Tribuneſhip,</hi> which <hi>Clodius,</hi> had laid up in the Capitol. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Senate was aſſembled, and <hi>Clodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Complained of <hi>Cicero;</hi> who anſwered, <hi>That</hi> Clodius <hi>was never legally</hi> Tribune, <hi>and therefore whatever he had done, was void and of no Authority.</hi> But <hi>Cato</hi> interrupted him, and ſtanding up, ſaid, <hi>That indeed he did not at all approve of</hi> Clodius <hi>his Proceedings; but if they queſtioned the Validity of what had been done in his</hi> Tribuneſhip, <hi>they might alſo queſtion what himſelf had done at</hi> Cyprus: <hi>for the Expedition was unlawfull, if he that ſent him had no lawful Authority. But, he thought</hi> Clodius <hi>was legally made</hi> Tribune, <hi>who, by permiſſion of the Law, was from a</hi> Patrician <hi>adopted into a</hi> Plebeian <hi>Family: and if he had done ill in this Office, he ought to be called to account for it; but the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Magiſtracy ought not to ſuffer for the Faults of the Magiſtrate. Cicero</hi> took this
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:33760:313"/>
very ill, and for along time diſcontinued his Friendſhip with <hi>Cato:</hi> but they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reconciled upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſſus,</hi> by Agreement with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> (who came over the <hi>Alpes,</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,) had laid a Deſign, That they two ſhould ſtand to be choſen <hi>Conſuls</hi> a ſecond time; and when they ſhould be in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they would continue to <hi>Caeſar</hi> his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for five years more, and take to themſelves the greateſt Provinces, with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and money to maintain them. This ſeemed a plain Conſpiracy, to deſtroy the Commonwealth, and divide the Empire. Several honeſt Men had intended to ſtand to be <hi>Conſuls</hi> that year: but upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of theſe great Men, they all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, except only <hi>Lucius Domitius,</hi> who had married <hi>Porcia,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Cato,</hi> and was by him perſwaded to ſtand it out, and not abandon ſuch an Undertaking; <hi>which</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>was not only to gain the</hi> Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>but to preſerve the Liberty of</hi> Rome. In the mean time, 'twas uſually diſcourſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the more prudent part of the Citizens, That they ought not to ſuffer the Power of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſſus</hi> to be united, which would then grow beyond all Bounds, and become dangerous to the State; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one of them muſt be denied. For theſe Reaſons they took part with <hi>Domitius;</hi> whom
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:33760:314"/>
they exhorted and encouraged to go on, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him, that many who feared openly to appear for him, would privately aſſiſt him. <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party, fearing this, laid wait for <hi>Domitius,</hi> and ſet upon him as he was going before day-light, with Torches, into the Field. Firſt he that bore the Light next before <hi>Domitius,</hi> was knock'd down; then ſeveral others being wounded, all the reſt fled, except <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Domitius:</hi> for <hi>Cato</hi> held him, (tho' himſelf were wounded in the Arm) and crying out, <hi>conjured the others to ſtay, and while they had breath, not to forſake the defence of their Liberty, againſt thoſe Tyrants, who plainly ſhewed with what Moderation they were like to uſe the Power, which they endeavour'd to gain by ſuch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> But at length <hi>Domitius</hi> alſo no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger willing to ſtand the Danger, fled to his own Houſe; and ſo <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſſus</hi> were declared <hi>Conſuls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Cato</hi> would not give over; but reſolv'd to ſtand himſelf to be <hi>Praetor</hi> that year, which he thought would be ſome help to him, in his deſign of oppoſing them: that he might not act as a private Man, when he was to contend with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Magiſtrates. <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſſus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended this: and fearing that the Office of <hi>Praetor</hi> in the Perſon of <hi>Cato,</hi> might be equal in Authority to that of <hi>Conſul;</hi> they
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:33760:314"/>
aſſembled the Senate unexpectedly, without giving any notice to a great many of the Senators, and made an Order, <q>That thoſe who were choſen <hi>Praetors,</hi> ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enter upon their Office, without attending the uſual time, in which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, they might be accuſed, if they had corrupted the People with Gifts.</q> When by this Order they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from being called to account; they ſet up their own Friends and Dependants to ſtand for the <hi>Praetorſhip,</hi> giving Money, and ſolliciting the People for their Voices. Yet the Vertue and Reputation of <hi>Cato</hi> was like to triumph over all theſe Stratagems: for many of the People abhorred, that <hi>Cato</hi> ſhould be ſold, who ought rather to be hired to take upon him the Office: ſo he carried it by the Voices of the firſt Tribe. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Pompey</hi> immediately frames a Lye, crying out, It thunder'd, and ſtraight broke up the Aſſembly. For the <hi>Romans</hi> religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved thoſe things, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded any Matter, after it had thunder'd. Againſt the next time, they had diſtributed larger Bribes; and did alſo keep the beſt Men out of the Field. By theſe foul means they procured <hi>Vatinius</hi> to be choſen <hi>Praetor</hi> inſtead of <hi>Cato.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, that thoſe who had thus corruptly and diſhoneſtly given their Voices, made what haſt they could
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:33760:315"/>
out of the Field: but the others ſtaying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and much grieving at what was done, one of the <hi>Tribunes</hi> continued the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; and <hi>Cato</hi> ſtanding up, did, as it were by Inſpiration, foretell all the Miſeries that afterward befell the State: <q>then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to beware of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who were guilty of ſuch things, and had laid ſuch Deſigns, that they might well fear to have <hi>Cato</hi> their <hi>Proetor.</hi>
               </q> When he had ended this Speech, he was followed to his Houſe by a greater number of People than all the <hi>Proetors</hi> together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caius Trebonius</hi> propoſed the Law for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loting Provinces to the <hi>Conſuls;</hi> whereby one was to have <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> the other <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> with full power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War and Peace, both by Sea and Land, as they ſhould think fit. When this was propoſed, all men deſpaired of putting any ſtop to it; and therefore ſaid nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. But <hi>Cato,</hi> before they began Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, went up into the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> and deſired to be heard; they would ſcarce allow him two hours to ſpeak. Having ſpent that time, in declaring many things that were paſſed, and foretelling many that were to come, they would not ſuffer him to ſpeak any longer; but as he was going on, a Serjeant came and pull'd him down: yet when he was down, he ſtill continued his Diſcourſe;
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:33760:315"/>
and many there were who hearkened to him, and were much concern'd for him. Then the Serjeant took him, and forc'd him out of the <hi>Forum;</hi> but as ſoon as he got looſe, he returned again, crying out to the People, to ſtand by him. <hi>Cato</hi> having done thus ſeveral times, <hi>Trebonius</hi> grew very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and commanded him to be carried to Priſon; but the Multitude followed him, and hearkened to him, who made a Speech to them, as he went along. Whereupon <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonius</hi> was afraid, and ordered him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed: thus was all that day ſpent, and the Buſineſs driven off by <hi>Cato.</hi> But afterward, many of the Citizens being over-aw'd by Fears and Threats, and others won by Gifts and Favours: <hi>Aquilius,</hi> one of the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> they ſhut into the Senate houſe; <hi>Cato,</hi> who cry'd, It thundered, they drove out of the <hi>Forum;</hi> many were wounded, and ſome ſlain: at length by open force they paſſed the Law. At this many were ſo incenſed, that they got together, and reſolved to throw down the Statues of <hi>Pompey:</hi> but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> went, and diverted them from that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p>Again, another Law was propoſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Provinces and Legions for <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi> Upon this occaſion <hi>Cato</hi> did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf to the People, but to <hi>Pompey;</hi> and told him, <hi>He did not conſider now; that</hi>
               <pb n="616" facs="tcp:33760:316"/>
               <hi>he took</hi> Caeſar <hi>upon his own Shoulders, who would ſhortly grow too weighty for him; and at length, not able to lay down the burthen, nor yet to bear it any longer, he would fall with it upon the Commonwealth: and then he would remember</hi> Cato's <hi>Advice; which was no leſs advantageous to him, than juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in it ſelf.</hi> Thus was <hi>Pompey</hi> often warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſtill went on; never miſtruſting <hi>Coeſar</hi>'s Change, and always confiding in his own Power and good Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> was made <hi>Proetor</hi> the following year; but, it ſeems, he did not more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and credit the Office by his ſignal Integrity, than he did diſgrace and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it by his ſtrange Behaviour, for he would often come to the Court without his Shooes, and ſit upon the Bench without his Gown; and in this Habit give Judgment in the greateſt Cauſes, and upon Perſons of the beſt Quality. 'Tis ſaid alſo, he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch Buſineſs after Dinner, when he had drunk Wine: but this was wrongfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him.</p>
            <p>The People were at that time extreamly corrupted by the Bribes of thoſe who ſought Offices; and many made a conſtant Trade of ſelling their Voices. <hi>Cato</hi> was reſolved utterly to root this Corruption out of the Commonwealth; therefore he perſwaded the Senate to make an Order, That thoſe
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:33760:316"/>
who were choſen into any Office, tho' no body did accuſe them, ſhould be obliged to come into the Court, and give account up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath how they had dealt in their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This very much diſpleaſed thoſe who ſtood for the Offices; but much more thoſe who took the Bribes: inſomuch that one Morning, as <hi>Cato</hi> was going to the Place where he kept Court, a great multitude of People flocked together, and with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty uproar fell to reviling him, and threw Stones at him. Thoſe that were about the Tribunal, preſently fled; <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forc'd thence, and juſtled about in the Throng, very narrowly eſcaped the Stones that were thrown at him, and with much difficulty got into the <hi>Roſtra;</hi> where ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins up with a bold and undaunted Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he appeas'd the Tumult, and ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Clamour: then he began to ſpeak, and was heard with great attention; ſo that he perfectly quelled the Sedition. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the Senate commending him for this; <hi>But I don't commend you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>for aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning your</hi> Praetor <hi>in Danger, and bringing him no Aſſiſtance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Candidates were in great perplexity: for every one dreaded to give Money himſelf; and yet feared leſt his Competitors ſhould. At length they all agreed to lay down an hundred and twenty
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:33760:317"/>
five thouſand Drachma's apiece, and then go on to canvaſs fairly and honeſtly, on condition, that if any one was found to make uſe of Bribery, he ſhould forfeit the Money. Being thus agreed, they choſe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> to keep the Stakes, and arbitrate the Matter: to him therefore they brought the Sum concluded on, and before him ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Agreement; he refuſed to take the Money, but would have others bound for them. Upon the day of Election, <hi>Cato</hi> ſtood by the <hi>Tribune</hi> that took the Votes, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry watchfully obſerving all that paſſed, he diſcover'd one who had broken the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and immediately ordered him to pay his Money to the reſt: but they much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the Juſtice of <hi>Cato,</hi> remitted the Penalty, as thinking the Diſhonour a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Puniſhment. This rais'd <hi>Cato</hi> as much Envy, as it gain'd him Reputation: and many were offended at him, as if he did hereby take upon himſelf the whole Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Senate, Court of Judicature, and other Magiſtracies. For there is no Vertue, the Honour and Credit whereof procures a man more Envy, than that of Juſtice: and that becauſe it acquires a man great Power and Authority among the common People. For they only revere the Valiant, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Wiſe; while they truly love juſt men, and in theſe have entire Truſt and
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:33760:317"/>
Confidence: but of the former, they fear the one, and always miſtruſt the other. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they think men rather beholding to their Complexion, than to any goodneſs of their Will, for thoſe Vertues: for they look upon Valour as a certain natural firmity of the Mind; and Wiſdom as the effect of a fine Conſtitution. Whereas a man has it in his own power to be Juſt; if he have but the will to be ſo: and therefore alſo Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is thought the moſt diſhonourable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis leaſt excuſable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> upon this account was oppos'd by all the great Men, who thought themſelves reprov'd by his Vertue. <hi>Pompey</hi> eſpecially look'd upon the increaſe of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Credit, as the ruin of his own Power; and therefore continually ſet up men to rail againſt him. Among theſe was the ſeditious <hi>Clodius,</hi> now again united to <hi>Pompey;</hi> he declared open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Cato</hi> had convey'd away a great deal of the Treaſure that was found in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus;</hi> and that he hated <hi>Pompey,</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he refuſed to marry his Daughter. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> anſwered, <hi>That although they had allow'd him neither Horſe nor Men, he had brought more Treaſure from</hi> Cyprus <hi>alone, than</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey <hi>had, after ſo many Wars and Triumphs, from the ranſack'd World: that he never ſought the Alliance of</hi> Pompey; <hi>not that he thought him unworthy of being related to him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
               <pb n="620" facs="tcp:33760:318"/>
               <hi>he differ'd ſo much from him, in things that concerned the Commonwealth; for</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I laid down the Province that was given me, when I went out of my</hi> Praetorſhip: <hi>on the contrary,</hi> Pompey <hi>retains many Provinces to himſelf, and many he beſtows on others; late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſent</hi> Caeſar <hi>ſix thouſand Men into</hi> Gaul, <hi>which were never ask'd of the People, nor ever given by their conſent. Thus unlimitted Powers, Men, Horſe and Arms, are become the mutual Gifts of private Men to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And</hi> Pompey <hi>ſtill keeps the Titles of Commander and General; but gives the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Provinces to others to govern: while he himſelf preſides in the City; and ſtays at home to model Seditions, and contrive Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults in Elections: whence 'tis plain, he aims at raiſing himſelf a Monarchy out of our Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Thus did <hi>Cato</hi> take occaſion ſharply to reflect on <hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcus Favonius</hi> was an intimate Friend, and zealous Imitator of <hi>Cato;</hi> ſuch as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore <hi>Apollodorus Phalereus</hi> is ſaid to have been of <hi>Socrates,</hi> with whoſe Diſcourſes he was wont to be ſo tranſported, that he would ſeem perfectly mad, and as it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd. This <hi>Favonius</hi> ſtood to choſen <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile,</hi> and was like to loſe it: but <hi>Cato,</hi> who was there to aſſiſt him, obſerved that all the Votes were written in one Hand; and diſcovering the Cheat, appeal'd to the
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:33760:318"/>
               <hi>Tribunes,</hi> who voided the Election. <hi>Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was afterward choſen <hi>Aedile,</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> who aſſiſted him in all things that belong'd to his Office, did alſo take care of the Plays that were exhibited in the Theater: to the Actors <hi>Cato</hi> gave Crowns, not of Gold, but of wild Olive, ſuch as us'd to be given at the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games. Inſtead of the magnificent Gifts, that were wont to be beſtow'd on the People, he gave to the <hi>Groecians</hi> Leeks, Lettices, Radiſhes and Pears; and to the <hi>Romans,</hi> earthen Pots of Wine, Pork, Figs, Cucumbers, and little Fagots of Wood. Some laugh'd at <hi>Cato</hi> for this; and others were well pleas'd with the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which they look'd on as a relaxation of his uſual Auſterity. In fine, <hi>Favonius</hi> himſelf mingled with the Crowd, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting among the Spectators, applauded <hi>Cato,</hi> bid him beſtow Honours and Rewards on thoſe who did well, and aſſur'd the People, that he had given all the Power into <hi>Cato</hi>'s Hands. At the ſame time <hi>Curio,</hi> the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue of <hi>Favonius,</hi> gave very magnificent Plays in another Theatre. But the People left his, and went to thoſe of <hi>Favonius,</hi> which they very much applauded, ſeeing him act the private Man, and <hi>Cato</hi> the Maſter of the Shows; who did theſe things, in deriſion of the great Expences that others beſtowed; and to teach them, that in
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:33760:319"/>
Sports men ought to ſeek Diverſion only, and decent Chearfulneſs, not great Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and coſtly Magnificence; nor ſhould they imploy too much Care about things of little Concern.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Scipio, Hypſaeus,</hi> and <hi>Milo,</hi> ſtood to be <hi>Conſuls,</hi> and that not only with the uſual and common Diſorders of Bribery and Corruption: but with Arms and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were running deſperately into a Civil War. Whereupon 'twas propos'd, That <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> might be impower'd to preſide over that Election. This <hi>Cato</hi> at firſt oppos'd, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That the Laws ought not to ſeek protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from</hi> Pompey, <hi>but</hi> Pompey <hi>from the Laws.</hi> Yet this Confuſion laſting a long time, the <hi>Forum</hi> continually, as it were, beſieged with three Armies, and no poſſibility of putting a ſtop to theſe Diſorders: <hi>Cato</hi> at length a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that rather than fall into the laſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, the Senate ſhould freely confer all on <hi>Pompey:</hi> ſince 'twas neceſſary to make uſe of a leſſer Evil, to prevent a greater; and better to ſet up a Monarchy themſelves, than to ſuffer a Sedition to continue, that muſt certainly end in one. <hi>Bibulus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Relation of <hi>Cato</hi>'s, moved the Senate to create <hi>Pompey</hi> ſole <hi>Conſul: For that either he would preſerve the preſent Government; or they ſhould live quietly under the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Cato</hi> ſtood up, and, contrary to all
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:33760:319"/>
expectation, ſeconded this Motion, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>That any Government was better than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; and that he did not queſtion but</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey <hi>would deal honourably, and take care of the Commonwealth, thus committed to his charge. Pompey,</hi> being hereupon declared <hi>Conſul,</hi> invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Cato</hi> to his Houſe in the Suburbs. When he came, he ſaluted and embrac'd him very kindly, acknowledg'd the Favour he had done him, and deſired his Counſel and Aſſiſtance, in the management of this Office. <hi>Cato</hi> made Anſwer, <hi>That what he had ſpoken heretofore, was not out of Hate to</hi> Pompey; <hi>nor what he had now done, out of Love to him: but all for the good of the Commonwealth. That, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, if he ask'd him, he would freely give his Advice: but in publick tho' he ask'd him not, he would always ſpeak his Opinion.</hi> And he did accordingly: for firſt when <hi>Pompey</hi> made ſevere Laws for puniſhing, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Fines on thoſe who had corrupted the People with Gifts, <hi>Cato</hi> adviſed him, <hi>To let alone what was already paſs'd and to provide for the future: for if he ſhould ſeek into paſt Crimes, it would he difficult to know where to ſtop; and if he would ordain new Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, it would be unreaſonable to puniſh Men by a Law, which they had never broken.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, when many conſiderable Men, and ſome of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s own Relations, were accuſed, he grew remiſs, and let fall the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution:
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:33760:320"/>
but <hi>Cato</hi> ſharply reprov'd him, and urg'd him to proceed. <hi>Pompey</hi> had made a Law alſo, to forbid the cuſtom of making commendatory Orations, on behalf of thoſe that were accuſed: yet he himſelf writ one for <hi>Munatius Flaccus,</hi> and ſent it, while the Cauſe was pleading: which <hi>Cato</hi> ſeeing, he ſtopt his Ears with his Hands, and would not hear it read, for he was one of the Judges. Whereupon <hi>Flaccus,</hi> before Sentence was given, excepted againſt him, but was condemned notwithſtanding. And indeed <hi>Cato</hi> was the occaſion of great Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Perplexity, to almoſt all that were accuſed of any thing: for they fear'd to have him one of their Judges, yet did not dare to reject him: and many had been condemned, becauſe, refuſing him, they ſeemed not to truſt their own Innocence. To others it was objected, as a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, the not accepting <hi>Cato</hi> for their Judge.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, <hi>Caeſar</hi> lay with his Forces in <hi>Gaul,</hi> where he continued in Arms; and at the ſame time, by his Gifts, his Riches and his Friends, increas'd his Power in the City. Hereupon <hi>Cato</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd <hi>Pompey,</hi> and rouz'd him out of the negligent Security in which he lay, not imagining any Danger near: but ſeeing <hi>Pompey</hi> very ſlow, and unwilling or afraid
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:33760:320"/>
to undertake any thing againſt <hi>Caeſar; Cato</hi> reſolved himſelf to ſtand for the <hi>Conſulſhip,</hi> and preſently force <hi>Caeſar,</hi> either to lay down his Arms, or diſcover his Intentions. Both <hi>Cato</hi>'s Competitors were perſons very much beloved by the People. <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> who was one, had by <hi>Cato</hi>'s means acquired great Credit and Authority in the City; therefore it was thought unhandſom, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully done, to ſtand againſt him: but <hi>Cato</hi> did not take it ill; <hi>For 'tis no wonder</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>if a man will not yield to another, in that which he eſteems the greateſt Good.</hi> Now he perſwaded the Senate to make an Order, That thoſe who ſtood for Offices, ſhould themſelves ask the People for their Votes, and not ſollicite by others. This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much offended the common People: for it took from them, not only the means of receiving Money, but alſo the opportunity of obliging ſeveral Perſons; and ſo rendred them both poor, and leſs regarded. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, <hi>Cato</hi> himſelf was by nature altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unfit for the buſineſs of Canvaſſing: for he took more care to preſerve the dignity of his Character, than to obtain the Office. Thus by following his own way of Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and not ſuffering his Friends to do thoſe things which take with the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he loſt the <hi>Conſulſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas, upon ſuch like Occaſions, not
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:33760:321"/>
only thoſe who miſs'd the Office, but even their Friends and Relations, uſed to be much griev'd and out of Countenance for ſeveral days after: yet <hi>Cato</hi> took it ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedly; that he anointed himſelf, and play'd at Ball in the Field, and after Dinner went into the <hi>Forum,</hi> as he uſed to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Shooes or his Coat, and there walked about with his Acquaintance. But <hi>Cicero<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Blamed him; for that when Affairs requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch a <hi>Conſul,</hi> he would not take any Care, nor ſhew the People any Civility: as alſo that he afterward neglected to try again; whereas he had ſtood a ſecond time to be choſen <hi>Praetor. Cato</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>That he loſt the</hi> Praetorſhip <hi>the firſt time, not by any diſlike of the People; but by the power and corruption of his Adverſaries: whereas in the Election of</hi> Conſuls <hi>there had been no foul dealing. So that he plainly ſaw, the People were offended at his Manners; which an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man ought not to alter for their ſake: nor yet would a wiſe man attempt the ſame thing again, while he lies under the ſame Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> was then fighting with many war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Nations, whom he very bravely ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Among the reſt, it ſeems, he had ſet upon the <hi>Germans,</hi> (who yet were in Peace with the <hi>Romans</hi>) and ſlew three hundred thouſand of them. Upon which, ſome of
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:33760:321"/>
his Friends moved the Senate for a publick Thankſgiving: but <hi>Cato</hi> declared, <hi>They ought to deliver</hi> Caeſar <hi>into the hands of thoſe who had been thus unjuſtly aſſaulted; that they might expiate the Offence, and not bring a Curſe upon the City: yet we have reaſon</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to thank the Gods; for that they ſpared the Commonwealth, and did not take Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the Army, for the Madneſs and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the General.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Caeſar</hi> writ a Letter to the Senate, which was read open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: 'twas full of reproachful Language and Accuſations againſt <hi>Cato,</hi> who ſtanding up, ſeemed not at all concern'd; and without any Heat or Paſſion, but with a calm, and, as it were, premeditated Diſcourſe, expos'd the Scurrility and Folly of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> making it evident, that the Accuſations he had heap'd together againſt him, were nothing but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſive and ridiculous Railing. Then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rip up all <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Practices; and laid open his Deſigns from the beginning, as clearly, as if he never had been an Enemy to him, but a conſtant Confederate with him: and told the Senate, <hi>That if they were wiſe, they would not fear the</hi> Britains and Gauls, <hi>but</hi> Caeſar <hi>himſelf.</hi> This Diſcourſe ſo mov'd and awaken'd the Senate; that <hi>Caeſars</hi> Friends repented, they had made the Letter be read, which had given <hi>Cato</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of many reaſonable things, and
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:33760:322"/>
ſuch ſevere Truths againſt him. However, nothing was then concluded: only 'twas hinted, that they would do well to ſend him a Succeſſor. Hereupon <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Friends required, That <hi>Pompey</hi> alſo ſhould lay down his Arms, and reſign his Provinces; or elſe that <hi>Caeſar</hi> might not be obliged to either. Then <hi>Cato</hi> cry'd out <hi>What he had foretold, was come to paſs: now'twas manifeſt he would come upon them with his Forces; and turn againſt the State thoſe Armies he had got, by deceitfully impoſing on them.</hi> Yet <hi>Cato</hi> could not prevail much out of the Senate-houſe; for the People always magnified <hi>Caeſar:</hi> And the Senate were convinced by <hi>Cato;</hi> but were afraid of the People.</p>
            <p>When News was brought, That <hi>Caeſar</hi> had taken <hi>Ariminum,</hi> and was coming on with his Army toward <hi>Rome:</hi> then all men, even <hi>Pompey,</hi> and the common People too, caſt their eyes on <hi>Cato,</hi> who had alone fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, and firſt clearly diſcover'd <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. He therefore told them, <hi>If you had believ'd me, or regarded my Advice; you would not now have been reduc'd to ſtand in fear of one Man, and alſo to put all your Hopes in one alone.</hi> Then <hi>Pompey</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, <hi>That</hi> Cato <hi>indeed had ſpoken most like a Prophet; and that himſelf had acted too much like a Friend.</hi> Now <hi>Cato</hi> adviſed the Senate to put all into the hands of <hi>Pompey;</hi>
               <pb n="629" facs="tcp:33760:322"/>
               <hi>for thoſe who can raiſe up great Evils,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>can beſt allay them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> finding he had not ſufficient Forces, and that thoſe he could raiſe, were not very reſolute, he forſook the City. <hi>Cato</hi> reſolving to follow <hi>Pompey,</hi> ſent his younger Son to <hi>Munatius,</hi> who was then in the Countrey of <hi>Brutium,</hi> and took his eldeſt with him. But wanting ſome body to keep his Houſe, and take care of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; he took <hi>Martia</hi> again, who was now a rich Widow: for <hi>Hortenſius</hi> was dead, and had left her all his Eſtate. <hi>Caeſar</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made uſe of this Action alſo, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him with Covetouſneſs, and a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary Deſign in his Marriage: <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>if he had need of a Wife, why did he part with her? and if he had not, why did he take her again? unleſs he gave her only as a Bait to</hi> Hortenſius; <hi>and lent her when ſhe was young, to have her again when ſhe was rich.</hi> But in Anſwer to this, we may apply the Saying of <hi>Euripides,</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Firſt for Abſurdities: and ſurely none</l>
               <l>Will <hi>Hercules</hi> for want of Courage blame.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Now 'tis alike abſurd, to reproach <hi>Hercules</hi> for Cowardice, and to accuſe <hi>Cato</hi> of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs. Though otherwiſe, whether he did altogether right in this Marriage, might
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:33760:323"/>
be diſputed: for as ſoon as he had again taken <hi>Martia,</hi> he committed his Houſe and his Daughters to her, and himſelf followed <hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid, that from that day he never cut his Hair, nor ſhav'd his Beard, nor wore a Garland: but always full of ſadneſs, grief and dejectedneſs for the Calamities of his Countrey, he continually bore the ſame Habit to the laſt, whatever Party had Misfortune or Succeſs.</p>
            <p>The Government of <hi>Sicily</hi> being allotted to him, he paſs'd over to <hi>Syracuſe;</hi> where underſtanding, that <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Meſſana,</hi> with Forces from the Enemy, <hi>Cato</hi> ſent to him, to know the reaſon of his coming thither: <hi>Pollio</hi> on the other ſide, demanded of him the cauſe of theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions. <hi>Cato</hi> alſo hearing, that <hi>Pompey</hi> had quite abandon'd <hi>Italy,</hi> and lay incamp'd at <hi>Dyrrachium:</hi> he cry'd out, <hi>How dark and uncertain is the Will of Heav'n!</hi> Pompey, <hi>when he did nothing wiſely nor honeſtly was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſucceſsful: and now that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Countrey, and defend her Liberty, he is altogether unfortunate.</hi> As for <hi>Aſinius,</hi> he ſaid, he could eaſily drive him out of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily;</hi> but there coming greater Forces to his Aſſiſtance, he would not engage the Iſland in a War: wherefore he adviſed the <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſians</hi> to ſubmit to the Conqueror, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:33760:323"/>
for their own ſafety. Then he ſet Sayl from thence.</p>
            <p>When he came to <hi>Pompey,</hi> he conſtantly gave Advice to prolong the War: for he always hoped to compoſe Matters, and would by no means that they ſhould come to Action. For the Commonwealth would ſuffer extreamly, and be the certain cauſe of its own Ruine; whoever were the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moreover he perſuaded <hi>Pompey</hi> and the Council of War to ordain, That no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be ſack'd, that was ſubject to the People of <hi>Rome:</hi> and that no <hi>Roman</hi> ſhould be kill'd, but in the heat of Battel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he got himſelf great Honour, and brought over many to the Party of <hi>Pompey,</hi> who were much taken with the Moderation and Humanity of <hi>Cato.</hi> Afterward, being ſent into <hi>Aſia,</hi> to aſſiſt thoſe who were raiſing Men, and preparing Ships in thoſe Parts; he took with him his Siſter <hi>Servilia,</hi> and a little Boy which ſhe had by <hi>Lucullus.</hi> For ſince her Widowhood, ſhe had lived with her Brother, and very much recover'd her Reputation: having put her ſelf under his Care, follow'd him in his Voyages, and comply'd with his ſevere way of Living: yet <hi>Caeſar</hi> did not fail to aſperſe him upon her account alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Officers in <hi>Aſia,</hi> it ſeems, had no great need of <hi>Cato.</hi> But he brought over the People of <hi>Rhodes</hi> by his Perſwaſions;
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:33760:324"/>
and leaving his Siſter <hi>Servilia</hi> and her Child there, he returned to <hi>Pompey,</hi> who had now gotten together very great Forces both by Sea and Land. And here <hi>Pompey</hi> clearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd his own Intentions. For at firſt he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to give <hi>Cato</hi> the Command of the Navy, (which conſiſted of no leſs than five hundred Ships of War, beſides a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Pinaces, Scouts, and Tenders) But preſently bethinking himſelf, or put in mind by his Friends; that <hi>Cato</hi>'s principal and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aim, being to free his Countrey from all Uſurpation: if he were Maſter of ſo great Forces; as ſoon as ever <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould be conquered, he would certainly oblige <hi>Pompey</hi> to lay down his Arms, and be ſubject to the Laws. Therefore <hi>Pompey</hi> chang'd his Mind; and tho' he had before mentioned it to <hi>Cato,</hi> yet he made <hi>Bibulus</hi> Admiral. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, it appear'd, <hi>Cato</hi>'s Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the publick Good was no way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd. For when they were ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in a Battle at <hi>Dyrrachium, Pompey</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf encouraged the Army, and commanded all the Officers to do the like: yet the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers hearkened to them but coldly, and with ſilence. <hi>Cato</hi> ſpoke laſt of all; and diſcours'd to them out of the Principles of Philoſophy, ſuch things as the Occaſion required, concerning Liberty, Valour, Death and Glory: all which he delivered
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:33760:324"/>
with great vehemence of Affection; and concluded with an Invocation of the Gods, to whom he directed his Speech, as if they were preſent to behold them fight for their Countrey. At this the Army gave ſuch a Shout, as fill'd all their Leaders with Hope, and made them fall on without fear of Danger. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Party were routed, and put to flight: yet his good Fortune took ſuch advantage of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Cautiouſneſs and Diffidence, as rendred the Victory incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat. But of this we have ſpoken in the Life of <hi>Pompey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now while all the reſt rejoyc'd, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified their Succeſs; <hi>Cato</hi> alone bewail'd his Countrey, and curs'd that fatal Ambition, which made ſo many brave <hi>Romans</hi> murther one another.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Pompey</hi> following <hi>Caeſar</hi> into <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> left at <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> a great quantity of Munition, ſtore of Riches and many of his Domeſticks and Relations; the charge of all which he gave to <hi>Cato,</hi> with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand only of fifteen Cohorts; for tho' he truſted him much, yet he was afraid of him too: knowing full well, that if he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not, <hi>Cato</hi> would never forſake him; but if he conquer'd, would never let him uſe his Victory at his pleaſure. There were likewiſe many Perſons of eminent Quality, that ſtay'd with <hi>Cato</hi> at <hi>Dyrrachium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="634" facs="tcp:33760:325"/>When they heard of the Overthrow at <hi>Pharſalia; Cato</hi> reſolv'd with himſelf, that if <hi>Pompey</hi> were ſlain, he would conduct thoſe that were with him, into <hi>Italy,</hi> and then retire as f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r from the Tyranny of <hi>Caeſar</hi> as he could, and live in Exile: but if <hi>Pompey</hi> were ſafe, he would keep the Army together for him. With this Reſolution he paſs'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> where the Navy lay. There he would have reſign'd his Command to <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero:</hi> becauſe he had been <hi>Conſul,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only a <hi>Proetor:</hi> but <hi>Cicero</hi> refus'd it, and was going for <hi>Italy.</hi> At which <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Son being incens'd, would raſhly and in a heat have puniſh'd all thoſe who were going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and in the firſt place have laid hands on <hi>Cicero:</hi> but <hi>Cato</hi> reprehended him in private, and diverted him from that Deſign, Thus apparently he ſav'd the Life of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and preſerv'd ſeveral others beſides.</p>
            <p>Now underſtanding that <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great was fled toward <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or <hi>Lybia, Cato</hi> reſolved to haſten after him; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken all his Men aboard, he ſet Sail: but firſt to thoſe who were not willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, he gave free liberty to depart.</p>
            <p>When they came to the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> they met with <hi>Sextus, Pompey</hi>'s younger Son, who told them of the Death of his Father in <hi>Aegypt:</hi> at which they were all exceedingly griev'd, and declared, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:33760:325"/>
               <hi>Pompey</hi> they would follow no other Leader but <hi>Cato.</hi> Out of compaſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſo many worthy Perſons, who had given ſuch teſtimones of their Fidelity, and whom he could not for ſhame leave in a deſart Countrey, amidſt ſo many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; he took upon him the Command, and march'd toward the City of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> which preſently received him, tho' not long before they had ſhut their Gates againſt <hi>Labienus,</hi> Here he was inform'd, that <hi>Scipio Pompey</hi>'s Father-in-law, was received by King <hi>Juba;</hi> and that <hi>Appius Varus,</hi> whom <hi>Pompey</hi> left Governour of <hi>Lybia,</hi> had joyn'd them with his Forces. <hi>Cato</hi> therefore reſolved to march toward them by land, it being Winter; and having got together a great many Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to carry Water, he furniſhed himſelf like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with plenty of all other Proviſion, and a number of Carriages: he took alſo with him ſome of thoſe they call <hi>Pſſilli,</hi> who cure the biting of Serpents, by ſucking out the Poyſon with their Mouths, and have likewiſe certain Charms, by which they ſtupifie and lay aſleep the Serpents.</p>
            <p>Thus they marched ſeven days together. <hi>Cato</hi> all the time went on Foot at the Head of his Men, and never made uſe of any Horſe or Chariot. Ever ſince the Battel of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> he uſed to ſit at Table; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this to his other ways of Mourning,
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:33760:326"/>
that he never lay down but to ſleep.</p>
            <p>Having paſs'd the Winter in <hi>Lybia, Cato</hi> drew out his Army, which amounted to little leſs than ten thouſand. The Affairs of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Varus</hi> went very ill, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Diſſentions and Quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and their Submiſſions and Flatteries to King <hi>Juba;</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable for his Vanity, and the Pride he took in his Strength and Riches. The firſt time he came to a conference with <hi>Cato,</hi> he had ordered his own Seat to be placed in the middle, between <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Cato:</hi> which <hi>Cato</hi> obſerving, took up his Chair, and ſet himſelf on the other ſide of <hi>Scipio;</hi> to whom he thus gave the Honour of ſitting in the middle, tho' he were his Enemy, and had formerly publiſhed a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Libel againſt him. There are ſome who approve not this Action of <hi>Cato</hi>'s: and yet on the other ſide blame him; for that in <hi>Sicily,</hi> walking one day with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſtratus,</hi> he gave him the middle Place, out of the Reſpect he bore to Philoſophy. Thus did <hi>Cato</hi> pull down the Spirit of <hi>Juba,</hi> who before treated <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Varus</hi> no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his own Subjects: he reconciled them alſo to one another.</p>
            <p>All the Army deſired <hi>Cato</hi> to be their Leader: <hi>Scipio</hi> likewiſe and <hi>Varus</hi> gave way to it, and Offer'd him the Command. but
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:33760:326"/>
he ſaid, He would not break thoſe Laws, which he fought to defend; and he, being but <hi>Pro-proetor,</hi> ought not to command in the preſence of a <hi>Pro-Conſul;</hi> for <hi>Scipio</hi> had been created <hi>Pro-Conſul:</hi> beſides that the People would take it as a good Omen, to ſee a <hi>Scipio</hi> command in <hi>Africk,</hi> and the very Name would give Courage to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio</hi> having taken upon him the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, preſently reſolv'd (at the Inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Juba</hi>) to put all the Inhabitants of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica</hi> to the Sword, and to raze the City; for having (as they pretended) taken part with <hi>Coeſar. Cato</hi> would by no means ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this: but invoking the Gods, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and proteſting againſt it in the Council of War; he with much difficulty delivered the poor People from their Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Afterward, upon the Entreaty of the Inhabitants, and at the Inſtance of <hi>Scipio, Cato</hi> took upon himſelf the Government of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> leſt it ſhould fall into <hi>Coeſar</hi>'s hands; for it was a ſtrong Place, and very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous for either Party: yet it was better provided, and more fortified by <hi>Cato,</hi> who brought in great ſtore of Corn, repair'd the walls, erected Towers, made deep Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Out-works round the Town. The young Men of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica</hi> he lodg'd in the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; having firſt taken their Arms from
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:33760:327"/>
them: the reſt of the Inhabitants he kept within the Town, and took great care, that no Injury ſhould be done, nor Affront offer'd them by the <hi>Romans.</hi> From hence he ſent great quantity of Arms, Money, and Proviſion, to the Camp, and made this City their chief Magazine.</p>
            <p>He advis'd <hi>Scipio,</hi> as he had before done <hi>Pompey, by no means to hazard a Battel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Man experienc'd in War, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd with Succeſs; but to uſe delay: for time would cool the Heats and Paſſions of men, which are the chief ſupport and ſtrength of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers.</hi> But <hi>Scipio</hi> out of Pride rejected this Counſel, and writ a Letter to <hi>Cato; in which he reproach'd him with Cowardice: and that he could not content himſelf to lie ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure within Walls and Trenches; but he muſt hinder others, that they might not make uſe of the Courage and Reaſon they have to lay hold an Occaſions.</hi> In Anſwer to this, <hi>Cato</hi> writ word again, <hi>That he would take the Horſe and Foot which he had brought into</hi> Africk, <hi>and go over into</hi> Italy, <hi>to give</hi> Caeſar <hi>ſome Diverſion there.</hi> But <hi>Scipio</hi> derided this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition alſo. Then <hi>Cato</hi> openly avow'd, <hi>He was ſorry he had yielded the Command to</hi> Scipio, <hi>who, he ſaw, would not uſe his Power wiſely in the War: and if (contrary to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance) he ſhould ſucceed; doubtleſs he would uſe his Succeſs as unjuſtly at home.</hi>
               <pb n="639" facs="tcp:33760:327"/>
For <hi>Cato</hi> did then think, and ſo he told his Friends, <hi>That he could have but ſlender Hopes in thoſe Generals, that had ſo much Boldneſs, and ſo little Conduct. Yet if any thing ſhould happen beyond Expectation, and</hi> Caeſar <hi>ſhould be overthrown: for his part he would not ſtay at</hi> Rome; <hi>but would retire from the Cruelty and Inhumanity of</hi> Scipio, <hi>who had already given out fierce and proud Threats againſt many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what <hi>Cato</hi> had look'd for, fell out ſooner than he expected. For about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night came one from the Army, who brought word, There had been a great Battel near <hi>Thapſus:</hi> that all was utterly loſt; <hi>Caeſar</hi> had taken both the Camps; <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Juba</hi> were fled with a few only; and the reſt cut to pieces. This News (as 'tis uſual in War, and coming in the night too) did ſo frighten the People, that they were almoſt out of their Wits, and could ſcarce keep themſelves within the Walls of the City: but <hi>Cato</hi> went out, and meeting the People in this Hurry and Clamour, did comfort and encourage them what he could and ſomething appeas'd the Fear and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement they were in; telling them, That very likely things were not ſo bad in truth, but more than half augmented by Report: thus he pacified the Tumult for the preſent. The next morning he aſſembled
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:33760:328"/>
the three hundred, which he uſed as his Council; theſe were <hi>Romans,</hi> who traffick'd there in Merchandize and exchange of Money: there were alſo ſeveral Senators, and their Sons. While they were coming together, <hi>Cato</hi> walked about very quietly and unconcern'd, as if nothing new had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd. He had a Book in his Hand, which he was reading; in this Book was an account of what proviſion he had for War, Armour, Corn, Weapons, and Souldiers.</p>
            <p>When they were aſſembled, he began his Diſcourſe: <hi>Firſt with the three hundred themſelves: and very much commended the Courage and Fidelity they had ſhown, and their having very well ſerved their Countrey with their Perſons, Money and Counſel. Then he entreated them by no means to ſeparate; as if each ſingle man could hope for any ſafety in forſaking his Companions: on the contrary, while they kept together,</hi> Caeſar <hi>would have leſs reaſon to deſpiſe them, if they fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and be more forward to pardon them, if they ſubmitted to him. Therefore he advis'd them to conſult among themſelves, nor would he diſlike, whatever they ſhould propoſe if they thought fit to ſubmit to Fortune, he would impute their Change to Neceſſity; but if they reſolved to ſtand to it, and undergo ſome Danger for the ſake of Liberty, he ſhould not only commend, but admire their Valour.</hi>
               <pb n="641" facs="tcp:33760:328"/>
               <hi>And would himſelf be their Leader and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion too, till they had try'd the utmoſt Fortune of their Countrey: which was not</hi> Utica <hi>or</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drumetum, <hi>but</hi> Rome; <hi>and ſhe had often by her own ſtrength, rais'd her ſelf out of greater Difficulties. Beſides, as there were many things, that would conduce to their Safety; ſo chiefly this, that they were to fight againſt one, who by his Affairs would be much diſtracted, and by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Occaſions called into many ſeveral Places.</hi> Spain <hi>was already revolted to the younger</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey: Rome <hi>was unaccuſtomed to the Bridle, and impatient of it; would therefore be ready for Commotions and Inſurrections, upon every Turn of Affairs. As for themſelves, they ought not to ſhrink from any Danger: and in this might take Example from their Enemy. Who does ſo freely expoſe his Life to compaſs his unjuſt Deſigns; yet never can hope for ſo happy a concluſion, as they may promiſe themſelves: for, notwithſtanding the uncertainty of War, they will be ſure of a moſt happy Life, if they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; or a moſt glorious Death, if they miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. However,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>they ought to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate among themſelves, and pray to the Gods, that in recompence of their former Courage and Good-will, they would direct their future De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</hi> When <hi>Cato</hi> had thus ſpoken, many were moved and encouraged by his Speech: but the greateſt part were ſo animated by his Valour, Generoſity, and Goodneſs, that they
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:33760:329"/>
forgot the preſent Danger. And as if he were the only invincible Leader, and above all Fortune, they entreated him, <hi>To imploy their Perſons, Arms, and Eſtates, as he thought fit: for they eſteem'd it far better to meet Death, in following his Counſel; than to find their ſafety, in betraying one of ſo great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi> One of the Aſſembly propos'd the making a Decree, to ſet the Slaves at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and moſt of the reſt approved the Motion. <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid, <hi>That ought not to be done; for it was neither juſt nor lawful: but if any of their Maſters would willingly ſet them free; thoſe that were fit for Service, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> Which divers promiſed to do; whoſe Names he order'd to be enroll'd, and then withdrew.</p>
            <p>Preſently after this, he received Letters from <hi>Juba</hi> and <hi>Scipio. Juba,</hi> with ſome few of his Men, was retired to a Mountain, where he waited to hear what <hi>Cato</hi> would reſolve upon: and intended to ſtay there for him, if he thought fit to leave <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica;</hi> or to relieve him with an Army, if he were beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. <hi>Scipio</hi> alſo lay at Anchor, under a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Promontory, not far from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting an Anſwer upon the ſame account: but <hi>Cato</hi> thought fit to retain the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, till the three hundred ſhould come to ſome Reſolution.</p>
            <p>As for the Senators that were there, they
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:33760:329"/>
ſhew'd great forwardneſs, and did preſently ſet free their Slaves, and furniſh them with Arms. But the three hundred being Men that dealt in Merchandice and Uſury, much of their Subſtance alſo conſiſting in Slaves; the Heat that <hi>Cato</hi>'s Speech had rais'd in them, did not long continue. As ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that eaſily admit Heat, and as ſuddenly loſe it, when the Fire is removed: ſo theſe Men were heated and inflamed, while <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> was preſent. But when they began to reaſon among themſelves, the Fear they had of <hi>Coeſar</hi> ſoon overcame the Reverence they bore to <hi>Cato: For who are we?</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>and who is it we refuſe to obey? Is it not that</hi> Caeſar, <hi>to whom all the Power of</hi> Rome <hi>has ſubmitted? And which of us is a</hi> Scipio, <hi>a</hi> Pompey, <hi>or a</hi> Cato? <hi>But now that all Men make their Honour give way to their Fear; ſhall we alone engage for the Liberty of</hi> Rome? <hi>And in</hi> Utica <hi>declare War againſt him, from whom</hi> Cato <hi>and</hi> Pompey <hi>the great fled out of</hi> Italy? <hi>Shall we ſet free our Slaves againſt</hi> Caeſar, <hi>who have our ſelves no more Liberty than he is pleas'd to allow? No, let us, poor Creatures, know our ſelves; ſubmit to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and ſend Deputies to implore his Mercy.</hi> Thus ſaid the moſt moderate of them: but the greateſt part were for ſeizing the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; that by ſecuring them, they might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe <hi>Coeſar</hi>'s Anger. <hi>Cato</hi> though he perceiv'd
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:33760:330"/>
the Change, took no notice of it: but writ to <hi>Juba</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> to keep away from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> becauſe he miſtruſted the three hundred.</p>
            <p>A conſiderable Body of Horſe, which had eſcaped from the late Fight, were coming toward <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> and had ſent three Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>Cato,</hi> which yet did not all bring the ſame Meſſage: for ſome were for going to <hi>Juba;</hi> others for joyning with <hi>Cato;</hi> and ſome alſo were afraid to go into <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica.</hi> When <hi>Cato</hi> heard this, he ordered <hi>Marcus Rubrius</hi> to attend upon the three hundred, and quietly take the Names of thoſe, who of their own accord ſet their Slaves at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but by no means to force any body. Then taking with him the Senators, he went out of the Town, and met the principal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of thoſe Horſemen; whom he entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to abandon ſo many worthy <hi>Roman</hi> Senators, nor to prefer <hi>Juba</hi> for their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander before <hi>Cato:</hi> but to ſeek the mutual ſafety of one another, and to come into the City; which was impregnable, and well furniſh'd with Corn, and other Proviſion, ſufficient for many years: the Senators like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with Tears beſought them to ſtay. Hereupon the Officers went to conſult their Souldiers, and <hi>Cato</hi> with the Senators ſate down upon the Works, expecting their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. In the mean time comes <hi>Rubrius</hi> in great Diſorder, crying out, The three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:33760:330"/>
were all in Commotion, and raiſing Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults in the City. At this all the reſt fell into Deſpair, lamenting and bewailing their condition: but <hi>Cato</hi> endeavour'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, and ſent to the three hundred, deſiring them to have a little patience. Then the Officers of the Horſe returned, with no very reaſonable Demands. <hi>They ſaid, they did not deſire to ſerve</hi> Juba <hi>for his Pay; nor ſhould they fear</hi> Caeſar, <hi>while they follow'd</hi> Cato: <hi>but they dreaded to be ſhut up with the</hi> Uticans, <hi>Men of a traiterous Nature, and</hi> Carthaginian <hi>Race, for tho' they were quiet at preſent: yet as ſoon as</hi> Caeſar <hi>ſhould appear, without doubt they would conſpire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and betray the</hi> Romans. <hi>Therefore if he expected they ſhould joyn with him; he muſt drive out of the Town, or deſtroy all the</hi> Uticans: <hi>that he might receive them into a Place void both of Enemies and Barbarians.</hi> This <hi>Cato</hi> thought very cruel and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: but he mildly anſwered, He would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the three hundred.</p>
            <p>Then he returned to the City, where he found the Men, not framing Excuſes, or diſſembling, out of Reverence to him: but openly refuſing to make War againſt <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar; which</hi> (they ſaid) <hi>they were neither able, nor willing to do.</hi> And ſome there were who muttered out ſomething, about retaining the Senators till <hi>Coeſar</hi>'s coming; but <hi>Cato</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:33760:331"/>
not to hear this, for he was a little deaf. At the ſame time came one to him, and told him, The Horſe were going away. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> fearing leaſt the three hundred ſhould take ſome deſperate Reſolution concerning the Senators, he preſently went out with ſome of his Friends; and ſeeing they were gone ſome way, he took Horſe, and rid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. They, when they ſaw him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were very glad, and receiv'd him very kindly, entreating him to ſave himſelf with them. At this time ('tis ſaid) <hi>Cato</hi> ſhed Tears; while earneſtly begging for the Senators, and ſtretching out his Hands, ſome of their Horſes he ſtopp'd, and hung upon their Arms, till he had prevailed with them, out of Compaſſion, to ſtay only that one day, to procure a ſafe Retreat for the Senators. Having thus perſuaded them to go along with him, ſome he plac'd at the Gates of the Town, and to others gave the charge of the Citadel. Now the three hundred began to fear, they ſhould ſuffer for their Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and ſent to <hi>Cato,</hi> entreating him by all means to come to them; but the Senators flocking about him, would not ſuffer him to go, and ſaid, They would not truſt their Guardian and Saviour to the Hands of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Traitors.</p>
            <p>At this inſtant (in my opinion) did moſt evidently appear to all in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:33760:331"/>
the Clearneſs, and admirable Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Virtue; how ſincere, untain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and free it was from any mixture of Self-regard: that he, who had long before reſolv'd on his own Death, ſhould take ſuch extream pains, toil, and care, only for the ſake of others: that when he had ſecured their Lives, he might put an end to his own; for 'twas eaſily perceived, that he had determined to die, tho' he did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not to let it appear.</p>
            <p>Therefore having pacified the Senators, he hearkened to the Requeſt of the three hundred, and went to them alone without any Attendance. <hi>They gave him many thanks, and entreated him to imploy and truſt them for the future; but in that they were not</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to'<hi>s, and could not come up to his greatneſs of Courage, they begg'd, he would pity their weakneſs; and told him, they had decreed to ſend to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>and entreat him chiefly, and in the firſt place for</hi> Cato; <hi>and if they could not prevail for him, they would not accept of pardon for themſelves, but as long as they had breath, would fight in his defence. Cato</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended their good Intentions; <hi>and adviſed them to ſend ſpeedily, for their own ſafety, but by no means to ask any thing in his behalf; for thoſe who are conquer'd, muſt ſubmit, and thoſe who have done wrong, beg pardon: for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was never overcome in all his Life, but</hi>
               <pb n="648" facs="tcp:33760:332"/>
               <hi>rather ſo far as he thought fit, had got the Victory, and had conquered</hi> Caeſar, <hi>in what was juſt and honeſt. And indeed</hi> Caeſar <hi>might be look'd upon, as one ſurpriz'd and vanquiſh'd; for he was now forc'd to diſcover and own thoſe Deſigns, which he had ſo long deny'd, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways practiſed againſt his Countrey.</hi> When he had thus ſpoken, he went out of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; and being informed, that <hi>Coeſar</hi> was coming with his whole Army; <hi>Alas!</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>does he come againſt us, as againſt men?</hi> Then he went to the Senators, and urged them to make no delay, but haſten to be gone, while the Horſemen were yet in the City. So ordering all the Gates to be ſhut, except one toward the Sea, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Ships for thoſe that were to depart, and gave Money and Proviſion to thoſe that wanted: All which he did with great Order and Exactneſs, taking care to ſuppreſs all Tumults, and that no wrong ſhould be done to the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcus Octavius</hi> coming with two Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, encamped near <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> and ſent to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> to treat about the chief Command. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> return'd him no Anſwer, but ſaid to his Friends; <hi>No wonder all goes ill with us, who are ſo much taken up with Ambition, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point of our Ruine.</hi> In the mean time word was brought him, that the Horſe were going away, and about to ſpoyl and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:33760:332"/>
the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ticans. Cato</hi> ran to them, and from the firſt he met, ſnatch'd what they had taken; the reſt threw down all they had gotten, and went away ſilent, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd of what they had done. Then he called together the Citizens of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> and requeſted them, in behalf of the three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, not to exaſperate <hi>Coeſar</hi> againſt them, but all to ſeek their common Safety toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them. After that he went again to the Port, to ſee thoſe who were about to imbark; and there he embrac'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd thoſe of his Friends and Acquaintance, whom he had perſuaded to go. As for his Son, he did not counſel him to be gone, nor did he think fit to perſuade him to forſake his Father. But there was one <hi>Statyllius,</hi> a young Man, in the flower of his Age, one of a brave Spirit, and very deſirous to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the invincible Conſtancy of <hi>Cato,</hi> who entreated him to go away, for he was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Enemy to <hi>Coeſar;</hi> but he refuſed to go. Then <hi>Cato</hi> looking upon <hi>Apollonides</hi> the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick</hi> Philoſopher, and <hi>Demetrius</hi> the <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick; It belongs to you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to bring down this young man's Spirit, and to make him know what is good for him.</hi> Thus having diſmiſs'd all the reſt, he returned to his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, gave Audience, and diſpatch'd Buſineſs; in which he ſpent that night, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the next day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="650" facs="tcp:33760:333"/>
               <hi>Lucius Coeſar,</hi> a Kinſman of <hi>Julius Coeſar</hi>'s, being appointed to go Deputy for the three hundred, came to <hi>Cato,</hi> and deſired he would aſſiſt him to make a perſuaſive Speech for them: <hi>And as to you your ſelf,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I ſhall not ſcruple to kiſs the Hands, and fall at the Knees of</hi> Caeſar, <hi>in your behalf.</hi> But <hi>Cato</hi> would by no means permit him to do any ſuch thing: <hi>For as to my ſelf,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>if I would be preſerved by</hi> Caeſar's <hi>Favour, I ſhould my ſelf go to him; but I will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to a Tyrant, for thoſe very things that are Marks of Tyranny: for 'tis an inſtance of his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation to preſerve men, as if he were Lord of their Lives, over whom he has no right to raign; but if you pleaſe, let us conſider what you had beſt ſay for the three hundred.</hi> And when they had continued ſome time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>Lucius</hi> was going away, <hi>Cato</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him his Son, and the reſt of his Friends; and taking him by the Hand, bid him farewel.</p>
            <p>Then he retired to his Houſe again, and called together his Son and his Friends; to whom he diſcourſed of ſeveral things: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, he forbad his Son to engage himſelf in the Affairs of State? <hi>For to act therein, as became him, was now impoſſible; and to do otherwiſe, would be diſhonourable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Toward Evening he went into his Bath. As he was bathing, he remembred <hi>Statyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
               <pb n="651" facs="tcp:33760:333"/>
and cryed out aloud, <hi>Well</hi> Apollonides, <hi>you have brought down the high Spirit of</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyllius; <hi>and is he gone without bidding us farewel? No,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Apollonides) I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd much to him, but to little purpoſe; he is ſtill reſolute and unalterable, and declares, he is determined to follow your Example.</hi> At this ('tis ſaid) <hi>Cato</hi> ſmiled, and anſwer'd, <hi>That will ſoon be try'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he had bath'd, he went to Supper, with a great deal of Company, at which he ſate, as he had always us'd to do, ever ſince the Battel of <hi>Pharſalia;</hi> for ſince that time he never lay down, but when he went to ſleep. There ſupped with him all his own Acquaintance, and ſeveral of the principal Citizens of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After Supper, the Wine produced a great deal of Wit, and learned Diſcourſe; many Philoſophical Queſtions were diſcuſſed: At length they came to the ſtrange opinions of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> called Paradoxes; and to this in particular, <hi>That the good man only is free, and that all wicked Men are Slaves.</hi> The <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick</hi> (as 'tis likely) oppoſing this, <hi>Cato</hi> fell upon him very warmly; and ſomewhat raiſing his Voice, he argued the Matter in a Diſcourſe of ſome length, which he urged with ſuch wonderful Vehemence, that 'twas apparent to every body, he was reſolved to put an end to his Life, and ſet
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:33760:334"/>
himſelf at Liberty. Hereupon, when he had done ſpeaking, there was a great Silence, and the Company much dejected: but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> to divert them from any ſuſpicion of his Deſign, turned the Diſcourſe, and fell again to talk of the preſent Affairs, ſhewing great Concern for thoſe that were at Sea, as alſo for the others, who travelling by Land, were to paſs through a dry and barbarous Deſart.</p>
            <p>When the Company was broke up, <hi>Cato</hi> walked with his Friends, as he us'd to do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Supper, gave the neceſſary Orders to the Officers of the Watch; and going into his Chamber, he embraced his Son, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of his Friends, with more than u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Ardour, which again renew'd their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of his Deſign. Then laying himſelf down, he took into his Hand <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue concerning the Soul: having read more than half the Book, he looked up, and miſſing his Sword, (which his Son had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, while he was at Supper) he call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Servant, and asked. Who had taken away his Sword? The Servant making no Anſwer, he fell to reading again: And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, not ſeeming importunate, or haſty for it, but as if he would only know what was become of it, he bid it be brought. But having ſtay'd ſome time, he had read over the Book, and no body brought the
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:33760:334"/>
Sword: whereupon he called up all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and in a haſty Tone demanded his Sword. To one of them he gave ſuch a Blow in the Mouth, that he hurt his own Hand; and now grew more angry, crying out, He was betray'd, and delivered naked to the Enemy, by his Son and his Servants. Then his Son with the reſt of his Friends, came running into the Room, and falling at his Feet, began to lament and beſeech him: But <hi>Cato</hi> raiſing up himſelf, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiercely; <hi>When</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>and how did I fall diſtracted? Why does no body perſuade me by Reaſon, or teach me what is better, if I have deſign'd any thing that's ill? But muſt I be diſarm'd, and hindred from uſing my own Reaſon? And you, young man, why don't you bind your Fathers Hands behind him, that when</hi> Caeſar <hi>comes, he may find me unable to defend my ſelf? Nor do I want a Sword to diſpatch my ſelf; I need but hold my Breath a while, or ſtrike my Head againſt the Wall.</hi> When he had thus ſpoken, his Son went weeping out of the Chamber, and with him all the reſt, except <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Apolloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des;</hi> who being left alone with him, to them he began to ſpeak more calmly: <hi>And you,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>do you think to keep a Man of my Age alive by Force? And do you ſit ſilent here to watch me? Or can you bring any Reaſon to prove, that it is not baſe, and unworthy</hi>
               <pb n="654" facs="tcp:33760:335"/>
Cato, <hi>when he can find his Safety no other way, to ſeek it from his Enemy? Or why do you not perſwade us, to unlearn what we have been taught, that rejecting all the Opinions we have hitherto eſtabliſhed, we may now by</hi> Caeſars's <hi>means grow wiſer, and be yet more oblig'd to him, than for Life only? not that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined ought concerning my ſelf, but I would have it in my power to perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what I ſhall think fit to reſolve; and I ſhall not fail to ask your Counſel, when I have occaſion to uſe what your Philoſophy teaches: in the mean time, don't trouble your ſelves, but go tell my Son, that he ſhould not compel his Father, to what he cannot perſuade him.</hi> They made him no Anſwer, but went weeping out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Then the Sword being brought in by a little Boy, <hi>Cato</hi> took it, drew it out and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on it; and when he ſaw the Point was good, <hi>Now</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I am Maſter of my ſelf:</hi> And laying down the Sword, he took his Book again, which, 'tis reported he read twice over. After this he ſlept ſo ſoundly, that he was heard ſnore by thoſe that were without.</p>
            <p>About Midnight he called up two of his Freed-men, <hi>Cleanthes,</hi> his Phyſician, and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> whom he chiefly imploy'd in publick Affairs: him he ſent to the port, to ſee if all the <hi>Romans</hi> were gone: to the Phyſician he gave his Hand to be dreſſed, for it was ſwell'd by the Blow he had ſtruck one of
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:33760:335"/>
his Servants. At this they all rejoic'd, hoping that now he deſign'd to live.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as,</hi> after a little while, returned, and brought word, they were all gone, except <hi>Craſſus,</hi> who had ſtay'd about ſome Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but was juſt ready to depart: he ſaid alſo, That the Wind was high, and the Sea very rough. <hi>Cato</hi> hearing this, ſigh'd, out of Compaſſion to thoſe who were at Sea, and ſent <hi>But as</hi> again, to ſee if any of them ſhould happen to return for any thing they wanted, and to acquaint him therewith.</p>
            <p>Now the Birds began to ſing, and <hi>Cato</hi> again fell into a little Slumber. At length <hi>But as</hi> came back, and told him, All was quiet in the Haven: Then <hi>Cato,</hi> laying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down, as if he would ſleep out the reſt of the night, bid him ſhut the Door after him. But as ſoon as <hi>But as</hi> was gone out, he took his Sword, and ſtabb'd it into his Breaſt; yet not being able to uſe his Hand ſo well, by reaſon of the Swelling, he did not immediately die of the Wound, but ſtruggling, fell out of the Bed, and throwing down a little Mathematical Table that ſtood by, made ſuch a noiſe, that the Servants hearing it, cry'd out. And immediately his Son and all his Friends came into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where ſeeing him lie weltring in his Blood, great part of his Bowels out of his Body, himſelf not quite dead, but looking
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:33760:336"/>
ghaſtly, they all ſtood amazed. The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician went to him, and would have put in his Bowels, which were not pierced, and ſow'd up the Wound: <hi>Cato</hi> hereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf, thruſt away the Phyſician, pluck'd out his own Bowels, and tearing open the Wound, immediately expired.</p>
            <p>In leſs time than one would think his own Family could have known this Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, all the three hundred were at the Door. And a little after the People of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> flock'd thither, crying out with one Voice, <hi>He was their Benefactor, and their Saviour, the only free, and only invincible man.</hi> At the very ſame inſtant they had News that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was coming; yet neither fear of the preſent Danger, nor deſire to flatter the Conquerer, nor the Commotions and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among themſelves, could divert them from doing Honour to <hi>Cato:</hi> for they ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly ſet out his Body, made him a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Funeral, and buried him by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, where now ſtands his Statue, holding a Sword. Which being done, they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſider of preſerving themſelves and their City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coeſar</hi> had been advertiſed, that <hi>Cato</hi> ſtay'd at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tica,</hi> and did not ſeek to fly; that he had ſent away the reſt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but, himſelf, with his Son, and a few of his Friends, continued there very uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedly;
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:33760:336"/>
ſo that he could not imagine what might be his Deſign: but having a great Conſideration for the Man, he haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thither with his Army. When he heard of <hi>Cato</hi>'s Death, 'tis reported, he ſaid theſe words: <hi>Cato, I envy thee thy Death, for thou haſt envy'd me the preſervation of thy Life.</hi> And indeed if <hi>Cato</hi> would have ſuffer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be preſerved by <hi>Coeſar,</hi> 'tis like he would not ſo much have impar'd his own Honour, as augmented the others Glory; yet what would have been done, we cannot know, but from <hi>Coeſar</hi>'s uſual Clemency, we may gueſs what was moſt likely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> was forty eight years old when he Dy'd. His Son ſuffered no Injury from <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar;</hi> but 'tis ſaid, he grew idle, and debauch'd with Women. In <hi>Cappadocia</hi> he lodg'd at the Houſe of <hi>Marphadates,</hi> one of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, who had a very handſom Wife, where ſtaying longer than was decent, he was reflected on by ſome, that made ſuch Jeſts as theſe upon him; <hi>Cato goes to morrow, after thirty days, and</hi> Porcius <hi>and</hi> Marphadates <hi>are two Friends, that have but one Soul,</hi> (for <hi>Marphadates</hi> Wife was named <hi>Pſyche,</hi> i. e. <hi>Soul:</hi>) and <hi>Cato is very well born, and an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Man, for he has a Royal Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all theſe Stains were clearly wip'd off by the Bravery of his Death; for in the Battle of <hi>Philippi,</hi> where he fought for his
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:33760:337"/>
Countrey's Liberty, againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,</hi> when the Army was broken, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to fly or to eſcape, called out to the Enemy, ſhew'd them who he was, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged thoſe of his Party to ſtay; At length he fell, and left his Enemies in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his Valour.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Daughter of <hi>Cato</hi> inferiour to the reſt of her Family, for Prudence and greatneſs of Spirit. She was married to <hi>Brutus,</hi> who killed <hi>Caeſar;</hi> was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that Conſpiracy, and ended her Life, as became one of her Birth and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: All which is related in the Life of <hi>Brutus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Statyllius,</hi> who ſaid he would imitate <hi>Cato,</hi> was at that time hindred by the Philoſophers when he would have put an end to his Life. He afterward follow'd <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> to whom he was very faithful and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſerviceable, and died in the Field of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi.</hi>

            <byline>Tranſlated from the Greek, by Sir <hi>Robert Thorald.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>THe Fable of <hi>Ixion,</hi> who imbracing a Cloud inſtead of <hi>Juno,</hi> begot the <hi>Centaurs,</hi> was ingeniouſly enough invented to repreſent to us ambitious Men, whoſe Minds doting on Glory, (which is a meer Image of Vertue) produce nothing that is genuine or uniform, but born away by violent and contrary Paſſions, their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being the off-spring of ſuch a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, muſt needs be deform'd and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:33760:339"/>
and they may ſay with the Herſdmen in the Tragedy of <hi>Sophocles.</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>We follow thoſe whom we ought to govern,</l>
               <l>And they command us, tho' th' are dumb.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>That is indeed the true condition of thoſe ambitious Men, who to gain a vain Title of Magiſtracy, are content to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Humours of the People: for as they who row in the fore-part of the Ship, may ſeem to guide the Motions of it, yet have continually an eye on the Pilot who ſits at the Helm, and muſt proceed in the Courſe he will ſteer; ſo theſe Men, ſteer'd as I may ſay by popular Applauſe, tho' they bear the Name of Governours, are in reality Slaves to the <hi>Mobile.</hi> The Man who is compleatly wiſe and virtuous, regards not Glory, but only as it diſpoſes and prepares his way to great Attempts. A young Man, I grant, may be permitted to glory a little in his good Actions; for (as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſays) his Vertues which are yet tender, and as it were in the bud, cheriſh'd and ſupported by Praiſes, grow ſtronger, and take the deeper root: but when this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is exhorbitant, 'tis dangerous in all men, and eſpecially in thoſe who govern a Commonwealth; for being joyn'd with an unlimited Power, it often tranſports men
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:33760:339"/>
to a degree of Madneſs, ſo that now they no more ſeek Glory by Vertue, but will have thoſe Actions only eſteem'd good that are glorious. As <hi>Phocion</hi> therefore anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King <hi>Antipater,</hi> who ſought his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſome unworthy Action, <hi>I cannot be your Flatterer, and your Friend;</hi> ſo theſe men ſhou'd anſwer the People, <hi>I cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and obey you:</hi> leſt it ſhou'd happen to the Commonwealth, as to the Serpent in the Fable, whoſe Tayl riſing in rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Head, complain'd (as of a great Grievance) that it was always forc'd to follow, and pray'd, it might be permitted by Turns to lead the way; which being granted but for a day, quickly diſcover'd the Folly, by the Miſchiefs which befell the whole Body, and particularly to the Head, in following, contrary to Nature, a Guide that was deaf and blind. The ſame we ſee does every day happen to many, who gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Inclinations of an ignorant and giddy Multitude, muſt needs bring all things to Confuſion.</p>
            <p>This is what has occurr'd to us to ſay of that Glory which depends on the Vulgar, conſidering the ſad effects of it in the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of <hi>Caius,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> Men nobly born, whoſe generous Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Nature was improv'd by an excellent Education, and who came to the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:33760:340"/>
of Affairs with very ſincere Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet they were ruin'd, I cannot ſay, by an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> immoderate deſire of Glory, but by a more excuſable fear of Infamy; for being exceſſively belov'd and favour'd by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they thought it an Ingratitude to deny them any thing, till the People and They mutually inflam'd, and vying with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Honours and Benefits, things were at laſt brought to ſuch a paſs, that they might ſay accordingly to the Proverb,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>T' engage ſo far we were to blame,</l>
               <l>And to retreat 'tis now a ſhame.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This the judicious Reader will eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Story. I will now compare with them, two <hi>Lacedoemonian</hi> Kings, <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> for they being deſirous alſo to pleaſe the People, by reſtoring their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete Laws of Equality, incurr'd the Hatred of the Rich and Powerfull, who cou'd not endure to be depriv'd of thoſe Advantages, which did ſo gloriouſly diſtinguiſh them from the Vulgar. Theſe were not indeed Brothers by Nature, as the two <hi>Romans,</hi> but they had a kind of brotherly Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in their Actions and Deſigns, which took a Riſe from Beginnings and Occaſions as I am now about to relate.</p>
            <p>When Gold and Silver (the great Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Mankind) had once gain'd Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:33760:340"/>
into the <hi>Lacedoemonian</hi> Commonwealth 'twas quickly follow'd by Avarice, baſeneſs of Spirit, and all manner of Frauds in the poſſeſſion, by Riot, Luxury, and Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in the uſe. Then <hi>Sparta</hi> fell from her original Vertue and Glory, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the days of <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Leonidas,</hi> who both together were Kings of the <hi>Lacedoemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agis</hi> was of the Royal Family of <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Son of <hi>Eudamidas,</hi> and the ſixth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent from <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> who being chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> gain'd ſo great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown in the ſo famous Expedition into <hi>Aſia. Ageſilaus</hi> left behind him a Son call'd <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidamus,</hi> who being ſlain by the <hi>Calabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> at <hi>Mardonium</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> was ſucceeded by his eldeſt Son <hi>Agis;</hi> he being kill'd by <hi>Antipater</hi> near <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> and leaving no Iſſue, was ſucceeded by his Brother <hi>Euda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midas;</hi> he by a Son call'd <hi>Archidamus</hi> and <hi>Archidamus</hi> by another <hi>Eudamidas,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this <hi>Agis</hi> of whom we now treat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonidas,</hi> Son of <hi>Cleonimus,</hi> was of the other Royal Branch of the <hi>Agiades,</hi> and the eighth in deſcent from <hi>Pauſanias</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated <hi>Mardonius</hi> in the Battel of <hi>Platea. Pauſanias</hi> was ſucceeded by a Son call'd <hi>Pliſtonax;</hi> and he by another <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> who being baniſh'd, and leading a private Life at <hi>Tegea,</hi> his eldeſt Son <hi>Ageſipolis</hi> reign'd
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:33760:341"/>
in his place; he dying without Iſſue, was ſucceeded by a younger Brother call'd <hi>Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus,</hi> who left two Sons: the elder was <hi>Ageſipolis,</hi> who reign'd but a ſhort time, and died without Iſſue; the younger was call'd <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> who had alſo two Sons. <hi>Acrotatus</hi> and <hi>Cleonimus:</hi> the firſt died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Father, but left a Son call'd <hi>Areus,</hi> who ſucceeded, and being ſlain at <hi>Corinth,</hi> left the Kingdom to his Son <hi>Acrotatus:</hi> This <hi>Acrotatus</hi> was defeated, and ſlain near <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galopolis,</hi> in a Battel againſt the Tyrant <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtodemus;</hi> he left his Wife big with Child, who being deliver'd of a Son, <hi>Leonidas</hi> (Son of the above-named <hi>Cleonimus</hi>) was made his Guardian, and the young man dying in his Minority, he ſucceeded in the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonidas</hi> was a Man in no great Eſteem with the People: for tho'there were at that time a general Corruption in Manners, yet a greater averſion to the old Inſtitutions appear'd in him than in others; for having liv'd a long time among the great Lords of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and been a follower of King <hi>Seleucus</hi> he unadviſedly wou'd imitate the Pride and Luxury of thoſe Courts, in the limited Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a <hi>Grecian</hi> Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agis</hi> on the contrary ſhew'd himſelf to all men obliging and affable, and did in goodneſs of Nature, and greatneſs of Mind
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:33760:341"/>
not only far excel <hi>Leonidas,</hi> but in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner all the Kings that had reign'd ſince the great <hi>Ageſilaus.</hi> For tho'he had been bred very tenderly, and in abundance of all things, by his Mother <hi>Ageſiſtrata,</hi> and his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother <hi>Archidamia,</hi> (who were the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt of the <hi>Lacedoemonians</hi>) yet before the Age of twenty, he ſo far overcame himſelf as to renounce effeminate Pleaſures. He was a very handſom Perſon, and of a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Behaviour; yet to give a Check to the Vanity he might take therein, would go always plain and mean in his Cloaths. In his Diet, Bathings, aad in all his Excerciſes, he choſe to imitate the old <hi>Laconian</hi> Frugality and Temperance, and was often heard to ſay, He wou'd not deſire the Kingdom, if he did not hope by means of that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reſtore their ancient Laws and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lacedoemonians</hi> might date the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Corruption from their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Athens,</hi> which was the firſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Wealth and Luxury; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law remaining in force, (by which every one was oblig'd to leave his lot or Portion of Land entirely to his Son) a kind of Order and Equality was thereby maintain'd, which ſtill in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree preſerv'd them from Ruine. But one <hi>Epitadeus</hi> happening to be <hi>Ephore,</hi> a Man
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:33760:342"/>
of a factious, violent Spirit, and on ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion incens'd againſt his Son, he procur'd a Decree, that all men ſhou'd have liberty to diſpoſe of their Land by Gift or Sale, or by their laſt Will and Teſtament: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promoted by him to ſatisfie a paſſion of Revenge, and through Covetouſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to by others, an excellent Inſtitution was abrogated; the effect whereof was, that the moneyed men coveting to poſſeſs the Land, the right Heirs were by degrees diſinherited, and all the Wealth being in the hands of a few, the generality were poor and miſerable; Liberal Arts and Sciences were neglected, and the City fill'd with a mean ſort of Mechanicks, always envious, and hating the Rich: there did not remain above 700 of the old <hi>Spartan</hi> Families, of which perhaps 100 might have Eſtates in Land; the reſt were an abject, low-ſpirited People, who having no ſenſe of Honour, were unwillingly drawn to the Wars, and ever greedy of Novelty and Change.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agis</hi> therefore believing it a glorious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, (as in truth it was) to repeople the City, and to bring them back to their firſt Inſtitution, began to ſound the Inclinations of the Citizens. He found the young Men diſpos'd beyond his expectation; for being taken with the ſpecious Name of Liberty they ſeem'd as ready to ſhift their Manners
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:33760:342"/>
as their Cloaths; but the old Men habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and more confirm'd in their Vices, were ſtartled at the very Name of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> as a fugitive Slave fears to be brought back before his offended Maſter: theſe men cou'd not endure to hear <hi>Agis</hi> continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring the preſent ſtate of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and wiſhing ſhe might be reſtor'd to her ancient Glory. But on the other ſide, <hi>Lyſander,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lybis, Mandroclidas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ecphanes,</hi> together with <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> did not only approve his Deſign, but aſſiſted and confirm'd him in it. <hi>Lyſander</hi> had a great Authority and Credit with the People; <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droclidas</hi> was eſteem'd the ableſt Man of his Time, to manage any Affair in the <hi>Grecian</hi> Aſſemblies, and joyn'd with skill, had a great degree of Boldneſs; <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was the King's Uncle by the Mother's ſide, an eloquent Man, but covetous and voluptuous; he was not mov'd by any Conſideration of publick Good, but rather ſeem'd to be perſwaded to it by his Son <hi>Hypomedon,</hi> (whoſe Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſignal Actions in War had gain'd him a high Eſteem among the young Men of <hi>Sparta</hi>) tho' indeed the true Motive was, becauſe he had many Debts, and hop'd by this means to be freed from them. As ſoon as <hi>Agis</hi> had prevail'd with his Uncle, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd by his mediation to gain his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo, who being exceeding rich, had by
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:33760:343"/>
her many Creditors, Friends and Followers, a conſiderable Power in the City. At the firſt propoſal ſhe was very averſe, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly advis'd her Son not to engage in ſo difficult and ſo dangerous an Enterpriſe; but <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> endeavour'd to poſſeſs her, that the thing was not ſo difficult as ſhe imagin'd, and that it might in all likelihood redound to the great Honour and Advantage of her Family. The King her Son earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her, not to decline aſſiſting him in ſo glorious a Deſign; he told her, he cou'd not pretend to equal other Kings in Riches, the very Followers and Servants of <hi>Seleucus</hi> or <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> abounding more in Wealth, than all the <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings put together: but if by Vertue and greatneſs of Mind he cou'd out-do them, and if by his means <hi>Sparta</hi> could be reſtor'd to her ancient Splendor, he ſhou'd then be a great King indeed. In conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Mother and the Grandmother alſo were ſo taken with the young man's gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Ambition, that they not only conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but were ready on all occaſions to ſpur him on to a Perſeverance, and did engage with him not only the men with whom they had an Intereſt, but the Women alſo, knowing well that the <hi>Lacedoemonian</hi> Wives had always a great power with their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, who us'd to impart to them their State Affairs, with greater freedom than the
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:33760:343"/>
Women wou'd communicate with the Men in the private Buſineſs of their Families: which was indeed one of the greateſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles to this Deſign; for the Money of <hi>Sparta</hi> being moſt of it in the Womens hands, 'twas their Intereſt to oppoſe it, not only as depriving them of thoſe ſuperfluous Trifles, in which through want of Vertue they plac'd their chief Felicity, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew their Riches was the main ſupport of their Power and Credit.</p>
            <p>Thoſe therefore who were of this Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had recourſe to <hi>Leonidas,</hi> repreſenting to him, how it was his part, as the elder and more experienc'd, to put a ſtop to the ill-adviſed Projects of a raſh young Man. <hi>Leonidas,</hi> tho' of himſelf ſufficiently inclin'd to oppoſe <hi>Agis,</hi> durſt not openly for fear of the People, who did manifeſtly favour him, and were deſirous of this Change, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand he did all he cou'd to incenſe the chief Magiſtrates againſt him, and on all occaſions craftily inſinuated, that <hi>Agis</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſign'd an arbitrary Government, wou'd divide among the Poor what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Rich, as a Bribe for a future Service: That inſtead of ſo many rich Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>Sparta,</hi> he might have a Company of Slaves to be his Guard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agis</hi> nevertheleſs little regarding theſe Rumors, caus'd <hi>Lyſander</hi> to be choſen <hi>Ephore;</hi>
               <pb n="670" facs="tcp:33760:344"/>
then took the firſt occaſion of propoſing his <hi>Rhetra</hi> or Decree to the Senate, the chief Articles whereof were theſe: <hi>That every one ſhou'd be freed from their Lots: All the Lands to be divided into equal portions: Thoſe that lay betwixt the Valley of</hi> Pellene <hi>and Mount</hi> Tegetum, <hi>as far as the Cities of</hi> Mallea <hi>and</hi> Sellaſia, <hi>into 4500 Lots; the remainder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 1500; theſe laſt to be ſhar'd by ſome cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the adjacent Countreys, men able and fit to bear Arms: The firſt among the natural</hi> Spartans, <hi>admitting alſo of Strangers to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Number, thoſe who were young, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and ingenious. All theſe were to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ten Companies, ſome of four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and ſome of two, with a Diet and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline agreeable to the Laws of</hi> Lycurgus.</p>
            <p>This Decree being propos'd in the Senate, occaſion'd a hot Debate; ſo that <hi>Lyſander</hi> doubting the Event, wou'd not expect the Iſſue, but immediately convok'd the great Aſſembly of the People, to whom he, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>droclidas</hi> and <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> made Orations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them, that they wou'd not ſuffer the Majeſty of <hi>Sparta</hi> to be brought into Contempt, to gratifie a few rich Men, who by ſpecious pretences endeavour'd to delude them, only that they themſelves might paſs their time in Riot and delights. They bad them call to mind, how ancient Oracles had forewarn'd them to beware of Avarice, as
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:33760:344"/>
the very Plague and utter Ruine of <hi>Sparta:</hi> That they ſhou'd think of the Oracle late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver'd from the famous Temple of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiphae</hi> in <hi>Thelamia.</hi> Some ſay, this <hi>Paſiphae</hi> was one of the Daughters of <hi>Atlas,</hi> who had by <hi>Jupiter</hi> a Son call'd <hi>Ammon:</hi> Others are of opinion, it was <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>Priamus,</hi> who dying in this Place, was call'd <hi>Paſiphae,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealing Secrets, as the Light diſcovers all things to the Eye: Others will have it, that this was <hi>Daphne,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clas,</hi> who flying from <hi>Apollo,</hi> was transform'd into a Lawrel, and honour'd by that God with the Gift of Prophecy. But be it as it will, 'tis certain the People were made to apprehend, that this Oracle had commanded them to return to their former ſtate of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality. As ſoon as theſe had done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Agis</hi> ſtood up, and ſaid, He wou'd not amuſe them with vain words, but contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to what had been propos'd for their Advantage by real Effects. In the firſt place, he wou'd divide among them all his Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which was of large extent in Tillage and Paſture; he wou'd alſo give 600 Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in ready Money, and that his Mother, Grandmother, and his other Friends and Relations, who were the richeſt of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedoemonians,</hi> were ready to follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The People tranſported with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:33760:345"/>
of the young man's Generoſity, highly applauded, and loudly declar'd, there had not been for 300 years ſo worthy a King in <hi>Sparta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, <hi>Leonidas</hi> was now more than ever averſe, being ſenſible that he and his Friends wou'd be oblig'd to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute with their Riches, and yet all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Obligation wou'd redound to <hi>Agis.</hi> He ask'd him then before them all, Whether <hi>Lycurgus</hi> were not in his opinion a vaſt and a wiſe Man? <hi>Agis</hi> anſwering He was: And when did <hi>Lycurgus</hi> (reply'd <hi>Leonidas</hi>) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Debts, or admit of Strangers? he who thought the Commonwealth not ſecure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were excluded. To this <hi>Agis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, 'Tis no wonder that <hi>Leonidas,</hi> who has married, and has Children by a Wife ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of a <hi>Perſian</hi> Court, ſhou'd know lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> or his Laws. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> took away both Debts and Uſury, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Money, and excluded Strangers, ſuch as wou'd not conform to the Laws of his Commonwealth, not for any Ill-will to them, but leſt they ſhou'd infect the City with their Covetouſneſs; for otherwiſe 'tis well known, that he himſelf gladly kept <hi>Terpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Thales</hi> and <hi>Phericides,</hi> tho' they were Strangers, becauſe he perceiv'd they were of the ſame Mind with him. <hi>And you that uſe to praiſe</hi> Ecprepes, <hi>who being</hi> Ephore,
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:33760:345"/>
               <hi>cut off two Strings from the Inſtrument of</hi> Phrynis <hi>the Muſician, and to commend thoſe who did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afterwards imitate him, with what face can you blame me, for deſigning to cut off Superfluity and Luxury from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? Do you think thoſe men were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd only about a Fiddle-ſtring, or intended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe, than by checking the voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Muſick, to keep out a way of living, which might deſtroy the harmony of the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this time forward as the common People follow'd <hi>Agis,</hi> ſo the rich Men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to <hi>Leonidas,</hi> who joyning his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with their Intereſt, things were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd in the Senate, (whoſe chief Power conſiſted in preparing all Laws before they were propos'd to the People) that with much ado the deſigned <hi>Rhetra</hi> of <hi>Agis</hi> was rejected, tho' but by one only Vote; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Lyſander,</hi> who (as we ſaid) was <hi>Ephore,</hi> and of <hi>Agis</hi> his Party, reſolving to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd on <hi>Leonidas,</hi> drew up an Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him, grounded on two old Laws; The one forbids any of the Race of <hi>Hercules</hi> to marry a Stranger; and the other makes it capital for a <hi>Lacedoemonian</hi> to travel into foreign Countreys. Whileſt he ſet others on to manage this Accuſation, he with his Collegues went to obſerve the Stars, which was a Cuſtom they had, and perform'd in this manner. Every ninth year the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori</hi>
               <pb n="674" facs="tcp:33760:346"/>
chooſing a Star-light Night, (when there was neither Cloud nor Moon) ſate down together in quiet and ſilence; and if they chanc'd to ſpy the ſhooting of a Star, they preſently pronounc'd their King guilty of ſome great Crime againſt the Gods, and thereupon he was immediately ſecluded from all Exerciſe of Regal Power, till he cou'd be reliev'd by an Oracle from <hi>Delphos</hi> or <hi>Olympus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lyſander</hi> therefore aſſur'd the People, he had ſeen a Star ſhoot, and at the ſame time <hi>Leonidas</hi> was cited to anſwer for himſelf. Witneſſes were produc'd to teſtifie he had married an <hi>Aſian</hi> Woman, beſtow'd on him by one of King <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Lieutenants; that he had two Children by her, but there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening ſome difference betwixt them, ſhe did ſo mortally hate him, that flying from her, he was in a manner forc'd to return to <hi>Sparta,</hi> where his Predeceſſor dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iſſue, he took upon him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Lyſander</hi> not content with this, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades alſo <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> to lay claim to the Kingdom: he was of the Royal Family, and Son-in-law to <hi>Leonidas,</hi> who fearing now the event of this Proceſs, was fled to the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> call'd <hi>Calcideos,</hi> together with his Daughter, the Wife of <hi>Cleombro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> for ſhe in this occaſion reſolv'd to leave her Husband, and to follow her Father. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onidas</hi>
               <pb n="675" facs="tcp:33760:346"/>
being again cited, and not appearing, they pronounc'd a Sentence of Depoſition againſt him, and made <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> King in his place.</p>
            <p>Soon after this Revolution, <hi>Lyſander</hi> (his year expiring) went out of Office, and new <hi>Ephori</hi> were choſen of the contrary Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who immediately conſpiring to reſtore <hi>Leonidas,</hi> cited <hi>Lyſander</hi> and <hi>Mandroclidas</hi> to anſwer, for having, contrary to Law, cancell'd Debts, and deſign'd a new diviſion of Lands. They ſeeing themſelves in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, had recourſe to the two Kings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them, how neceſſary it was for their Intereſt and Safety reſolutely to unite, thereby to prevent the Deſigns of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and put a ſtop to their Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Power of the <hi>Ephori</hi> (they ſaid) was only grounded on the Diſſention of Kings, the Law having in that Caſe made them a kind of Arbitrators; but when the two Kings were unanimous, none ought or durſt reſiſt their Authority. <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ombrotus</hi> thus perſwaded, went together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Senate-houſe, where raiſing the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori</hi> from their Seats, they plac'd others in their room, (of which <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> was one:) then arming a Company of young Men, and releaſing many out of Priſon, their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies began to be in great fear of their Lives; but there was no Bloud ſpilt. <hi>Agis</hi>
               <pb n="676" facs="tcp:33760:347"/>
on the contrary having notice that <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> had order'd a Company of Souldiers to lie in wait for <hi>Leonidas,</hi> to kill him as he fled to <hi>Tegea,</hi> immediately ſent ſome of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to defend him, and to convoy him ſafely into that City.</p>
            <p>Thus far all things proceeded proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, none daring to oppoſe; but by the ſordid Avarice of one Man, theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Beginnings were blaſted. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> (as we ſaid) was much in Debt, yet had a fair Eſtate in Land: and tho' he gladly joyn'd in this Deſign to be quit of his Debts, he was not at all willing to part with his Land: therefore he perſwaded <hi>Agis,</hi> that if both theſe things ſhou'd be put in execution at the ſame time, ſo great and ſo ſudden an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration might cauſe ſome dangerous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; but if Debts were in the firſt place cancell'd, the rich Men wou'd afterwards more eaſily be prevail'd with to part with their Land. <hi>Lyſander</hi> alſo was of the ſame opinion, being deceiv'd in like manner by the Craft of <hi>Ageſilaus:</hi> ſo that all Men were preſently commanded to bring in their Bonds, (or Deeds of Obligation, by the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemonians</hi> call'd <hi>Claria</hi>) which being laid together in a Heap, they ſet Fire to it. The Uſurers and other Creditors come, one may eaſily imagine, beheld it with a heavy heart; but <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> told them ſcoffingly,
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:33760:347"/>
His Eyes had never ſeen ſo bright and ſo glorious a Flame.</p>
            <p>And now the People preſs'd earneſtly for a diviſion of Lands: the Kings alſo had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it ſhou'd be done; but <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pretending one Difficulty, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another, delay'd the Execution, till an occaſion happen'd to call <hi>Agis</hi> to the Wars. The <hi>Achaeans,</hi> in virtue of a League defenſive, ſent to demand Succours, for they expected every day when the <hi>Aetolians</hi> wou'd attempt to enter <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> by the Confines of <hi>Maegara:</hi> they had made <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> their General, and ſent him with an Army to hinder this Incurſion. <hi>Aratus</hi> writ to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> who immediately gave order <hi>Agis</hi> ſhou'd haſten to their Aſſiſtance with the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Auxiliaries. <hi>Agis</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly well pleas'd to ſee the forwardneſs of the young Men to this Expedition; for tho' they were very poor, yet freed from Debts, and in hope of being Maſters of Land at their Return, they follow'd chearfully, and in good Equipage. The Cities through which they paſs'd, were in admiration, to ſee how they march'd from one end of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponneſus</hi> to the other, without the leaſt Diſorder, and in a manner without making any Noiſe: it gave them occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with one another, how great might be the Temperance and Modeſty of the
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:33760:348"/>
ancient <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> under their famous Captains <hi>Ageſilaus, Lyſander</hi> and <hi>Leonidas,</hi> ſince they ſaw ſuch Diſcipline and exact Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience under a King, who perhaps was the youngeſt Man in all the Army. They ſaw alſo how he was content to fare hardly, ready to undergo any Labours, and not to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by Pomp or Richneſs of Habit, from the meaneſt of his Souldiers. But if by this Moderation and Conduct he gain'd the Love of the Souldiers and the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it made him ſtill more odious to the Rich and Powerful, who were afraid ſuch an Example might work an Impreſſion to their prejudice, in all the neighbouring Countreys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agis</hi> having joyn'd <hi>Aratus</hi> near the City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> a Councel of War was call'd, to debate whether or no it were expedient to give the Enemy Battel. <hi>Agis</hi> on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhew'd a great Forwardneſs and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, yet without Obſtinacy or Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: he declar'd it was his opinion they ought to fight, thereby to hinder the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from entring <hi>Peloponneſus;</hi> but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he wou'd ſubmit to the Judgment of <hi>Aratus,</hi> not only as the elder and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd Captain, but as he was General of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> whoſe Forces he wou'd not pretend to command, but was only come thither to aſſiſt them. I am not ignorant,
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:33760:348"/>
that <hi>Baton</hi> of <hi>Synope</hi> relates it in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: He ſays, <hi>Aratus</hi> wou'd have fought, and that <hi>Agis</hi> was againſt it; but 'tis moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he was miſtaken, not having read what <hi>Aratus</hi> himſelf writes in his own Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for he expreſly tells us, That knowing the People had well-nigh got in their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, he thought it much better to let the Enemy paſs, than to hazard by a Battel the loſs of the whole Countrey: And therefore giving thanks to the Confederates for their readineſs, he diſmiſs'd them. Thus <hi>Agis,</hi> not without having gain'd a great deal of Honour, return'd to <hi>Sparta</hi> where he found the People in a Mutiny, and all things in Confuſion, occaſion'd by the Avarice and ill-Government of <hi>Ageſilaus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For he being now one of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and by that Authority freed from the Fear which Formerly kept him in ſome Reſtraint, forbore no kind of Oppreſſion which might bring in Gain: Among other things he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted a thirteen Months Tax, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had never paid more than twelve. For theſe and other Reaſons fearing his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and knowing how he was hated by the People, he thought it neceſſary to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Guard, which always accompanied him to the Courts of Juſtice; and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now on his Power, he was grown ſo inſolent, that of the two Kings, the one he
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:33760:349"/>
openly contemn'd; and if he ſhew'd any Reſpect towards <hi>Agis,</hi> wou'd have it thought rather an effect of his near Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than any duty or ſubmiſſion to the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Authority; and being deſirous all men ſhou'd be confirm'd in a belief of his Power, he gave it out he was to continue <hi>Ephore</hi> the enſuing year alſo.</p>
            <p>His Enemies alarm'd by this Report im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conſpir'd againſt him, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back <hi>Leonidas</hi> from <hi>Tegea,</hi> reſtabliſhed him in the Kingdom, to which the People (highly incens'd for having been defrauded in the promis'd diviſion of Lands) eaſily conſented. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> himſelf wou'd hardly have ſcap'd their Fury, if his Son <hi>Hypome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> had not mediated in his behalf, and then privately convey'd him out of the City.</p>
            <p>During this Combuſtion, the two Kings fled; <hi>Agis</hi> to the Temple of <hi>Juno,</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ombrotus</hi> to that of <hi>Neptune. Leonidas</hi> more incens'd againſt his Son-in-law, left <hi>Agis,</hi> to purſue him with a Company of Souldiers; and being taken, he was brought before <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onidas,</hi> who with great vehemence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd to him his Ingratitude; how being his Son-in-law, he had conſpir'd with his Enemies, uſurp'd his Kingdom, and baniſh'd him from his Countrey: <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving little to ſay for himſelf, ſtood ſilent. His Wife <hi>Chelonis</hi> had been a Partner with
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:33760:349"/>
               <hi>Leonidas</hi> in his Sufferings; for when <hi>Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus</hi> uſurp'd the Kingdom, ſhe forſook him, and wholly applied her ſelf to comfort her Father in his Affliction: ſhe often mediated in his behalf, and openly diſown'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd the Action as unjuſt; but now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Turn of Fortune, ſhe was as zealous and as aſſiduous in expreſſions of Love and Duty to her Husband, whom ſhe embrac'd with one Arm, and her two little Children with the other. All men were ſtrangely taken with the Piety and tender Affection of the Young Woman, who in a looſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Mourning, with a pale dejected Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and in a ſuppliant Poſture, ſpoke thus to <hi>Leonidas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am not brought to this Condition you ſee me in, nor have taken upon me this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Habit, by reaſon of the preſent Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of</hi> Cleombrotus; <hi>'tis long ſince familiar to me: it was put on to condole with you in your Baniſhment; and now you are reſtor'd to your Countrey and to your Kingdom, muſt I ſtill remain in Grief and Miſery? or wou'd you have me attir'd in my Feſtival Ornaments, that I may rejoyce with you, when you have kill'd within my arms, the Man to whom you gave me for a Wife? Either</hi> Cleombrotus <hi>muſt appeaſe you by my Tears, or he muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Puniſhment greater than his Faults have deſerv'd: he ſhall infallibly ſee me die before</hi>
               <pb n="682" facs="tcp:33760:350"/>
               <hi>him, whom he has profeſs'd tenderly to love: to what end ſhou'd I live, or how ſhall I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear among the</hi> Spartan <hi>Ladies, when it ſhall ſo manifeſtly be ſeen, that I have not been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to move to Compaſſion neither a Husband nor a Father? I am only born to be an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Wife, and a more unfortunate Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not having the leaſt Power or Intereſt, where I ought to have been in the greateſt Eſteem. As for</hi> Cleombrotus, <hi>I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſown'd his Cauſe, when I forſook him to follow you; but now you your ſelf will justifie his Proceedings, by ſhewing to the World, how Ambition is a Paſſion not to be reſiſted: for a Kingdom, a Man may kill a Son-in-law; nay even deſtroy his own Children. Chelonis</hi> having ended this Lamentation, turn'd her weeping Eyes towards the Spectators, then gently repos'd her Head in her Husband's Boſom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonidas</hi> touch'd with Compaſſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew a while to adviſe with his Friends; then returning, condemn'd <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> to perpetual Baniſhment: <hi>Chelonis,</hi> he ſaid, ought to ſtay with him, it not being juſt ſhe ſhou'd forſake a Father, who had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at her Interceſſion the Life of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; but all he could ſay, wou'd not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. She roſe up immediately, and taking one of her Children in her Arms, gave the other to her Husband; then having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:33760:350"/>
her Devotions at an Altar dedicated to <hi>Juno,</hi> ſhe chearfully follow'd him into Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. To be ſhort, ſo great was the Virtue and Generoſity expreſs'd by <hi>Chelouis</hi> on this occaſion, that if <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> were not ſtrangely blinded by Ambition, he wou'd chuſe to be baniſh'd with the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo excellent a Woman, rather than without her to poſſeſs a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> thus remov'd, <hi>Leonidas</hi> thought fit alſo to diſplace the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and to chooſe others in their room; then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider how he might entrap <hi>Agis.</hi> At firſt he endeavour'd by fair means to perſwade, that he wou'd come and partake with him (as was his Right) in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: the People, he ſaid, wou'd eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Errors of a young Man, ambitious of Glory, and deceiv'd by the Craft of <hi>Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus.</hi> But finding <hi>Agis</hi> was ſuſpicious, and not to be prevail'd with to quit his Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, he gave over that Deſign; yet what cou'd not then be effected by the Diſſimulation of an Enemy, was ſoon after brought to paſs by the Treachery of a Friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amphares, Demochares</hi> and <hi>Archeſilaus,</hi> did often viſit <hi>Agis,</hi> and he was ſo confident of their Fidelity, that after a while he was prevail'd with to accompany them to the Baths, which were not far diſtant, they conſtantly returning to ſee him ſafe again in
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:33760:351"/>
the Temple. <hi>Amphares</hi> had borrow'd a great deal of Plate and rich Houſehold ſtuff of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſiſtrata,</hi> and hop'd if he cou'd deſtroy her and the whole Family, he might peaceably enjoy thoſe Goods. To ſo baſe an intent, he was ready to ſerve <hi>Leonidas</hi> in any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous way, and being one of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> did all he cou'd to incenſe the reſt of his Collegues againſt <hi>Agis.</hi> Theſe men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finding that <hi>Agis</hi> wou'd never ſtir from his Sanctuary, but only when he went with them to the Bath, reſolv'd to make uſe of that occaſion. And one day in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, they met and ſaluted him as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, diſcourſing pleaſantly by the way, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Friends uſe to do, till coming to the turning of a Street which led to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Amphares</hi> by virtue of his Office ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted <hi>Agis,</hi> and told him, He muſt go with him before the other <hi>Ephori,</hi> to anſwer for his Miſdemeanors. At the ſame time <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chares,</hi> who was a tall ſtrong man, threw his Cloak over his Head, and dragg'd him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Neck, whilſt the others went behind to thruſt him on; ſo that none of <hi>Agis</hi> his Friends being near to aſſiſt him, they eaſily got him into the Priſon, where <hi>Leonidas</hi> was already arriv'd, with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Souldiers, who ſtrongly guarded all the Avenues: the <hi>Ephori</hi> were alſo there with as many of the Senators as they knew
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:33760:351"/>
to be true to their Party, being deſirous to proceed with ſome reſemblance of Juſtice. Firſt they bad him give an Account, why he had gone about to alter the Government To which <hi>Agis</hi> (only ſmiling at their Craft and Diſſimulation) anſwer'd not a word. <hi>Amphares</hi> told him, It was more ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to weep, for now the time was come in which he ſhou'd be puniſh'd for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Another of the <hi>Ephori</hi> ſeeming more favourable, (and offering as it were an occaſion of Excuſe) ſaid, He was confident <hi>Agis</hi> had been ſeduc'd, and in a manner conſtrain'd to what he did, by <hi>Lyſander</hi> and <hi>Ageſilaus.</hi> But <hi>Agis</hi> anſwer'd, He had not been ſeduc'd or conſtrain'd by any man, nor had any other intent in what he did, but only to follow the Example of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and to govern conformably to his Laws. They ask'd him, Whether now at leaſt he did not repent his Raſhneſs? To which he reply'd, That tho' he ſaw unavoidable Death before his Eyes, yet he cou'd never repent of ſo juſt and ſo glorious a Deſign, They had not the patience to hear him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer, but commanded the Serjeants to carry him into the Decade, (which was a place in the priſon where they us'd to ſtrangle Malefactors.) The Officers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to obey, and the very mercenary Souldiers declin'd it, believing it an inſolent
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:33760:352"/>
and a Wicked Act to lay violent hands on a King; which as ſoon as <hi>Demochares</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, threatning and reviling them for it, he himſelf thruſt him into the Room.</p>
            <p>By this time the News of <hi>Agis</hi> his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment having reach'd all Parts of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had occaſion'd a great Concourſe of People with Lanthorns and Torches about the Priſon-gates, and in the midſt of them, the Mother and the Grandmother of <hi>Agis</hi> crying out with a loud Voice, That their King ought to appear, and to be heard by the People, and ſhou'd at leaſt be proceeded with in the uſual Forms of Juſtice. But this Clamour inſtead of preventing, haſten'd his Death, his Enemies fearing if the Tumult ſhou'd increaſe, he might that very night be reſcued out of their hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agis</hi> being now at the point to die, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd one of the Serjeants bitterly bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Misfortune: <hi>Weep not Friend,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>for me, who die innocent, but rather grieve for thoſe who are guilty of this wicked Act; my condition is much better than theirs.</hi> As ſoon as he had ſpoken theſe words not ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt ſign of Fear, he patiently ſtretch'd out his Neck to the Executioner.</p>
            <p>Immediately after <hi>Agis</hi> was dead <hi>Ampha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> went out of the Priſon-gate, where he found <hi>Ageſiſtrata,</hi> who caſting her ſelf at his Feet, he gently rais'd her up, pretending
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:33760:352"/>
ſtill the ſame Friendſhip as formerly: he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd her, ſhe needed not fear any farther Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence ſhou'd be offer'd againſt her Son; and that if ſhe pleas'd, ſhe might go in and ſee him: ſhe begg'd her Mother might alſo have the favour to be admitted; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, No body ſhou'd hinder it. When they were enter'd, he commanded the Gate ſhou'd again be lock'd, and the Grandmother to be firſt introduc'd: ſhe was now grown very old, and had liv'd all her days with great reputation of Vertue and Wiſdom. As ſoon as <hi>Amphares</hi> thought ſhe was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, he told <hi>Ageſiſtrata,</hi> She might now go in if ſhe pleas'd: ſhe enter'd, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her Son's Body ſtretch'd on the Ground, and her Mother hanging by the Neck, ſhe ſtood at firſt aſtoniſh'd at ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid a Spectacle; but after a while recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Spirits, the firſt thing ſhe did, was to aſſiſt the Souldiers in taking down the Body; then covering it decently, ſhe laid it by her Son's, whom embracing, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Cheeks, <hi>O my Son,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>'tis thy too great Mercy and Goodneſs which has brought thee and us to this untimely End. Amphares,</hi> who ſtood watching behind the Door, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, ruſh'd in haſtily, and with a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tone and Countenance ſaid to her, <hi>Since you approve ſo well of your Sons Actions, 'tis fit you ſhou'd partake in his Reward.</hi> She
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:33760:353"/>
riſing up to meet her Deſtiny, only utter'd theſe few words, <hi>I pray the Gods that all this may redound to the good of</hi> Sparta.</p>
            <p>And now the three Bodies being expos'd to view, and the Fact divulg'd, no fear of Magiſtrates cou'd hinder the people from expreſſing a deteſtation of it, or from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the chief Contrivers and eſpecially <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidas</hi> and <hi>Amphares.</hi> They were not afraid openly to declare, that ſo wicked and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous an Act had never been committed in <hi>Sparta,</hi> ſince firſt the <hi>Doriens</hi> inhabited <hi>Pelopenneſus;</hi> the very Enemies in War, they ſaid, were always cautious of ſpilling the Bloud of a <hi>Lacedoemonian</hi> King, inſomuch that in any Encounter they wou'd decline, and endeavour to avoid them, ſo great a Reſpect they bore to the Royal Majeſty. I muſt needs ſay, 'tis very remarkable, that in ſo many Battels fought betwixt the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedoemonians</hi> and the other <hi>Grecians,</hi> none but <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> was kill'd, being wounded with a Javelin, at the Battel of <hi>Leuctres,</hi> a little before the days of King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon.</hi> I am not ignorant, that the <hi>Meſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> affirm, <hi>Theopompus</hi> was alſo ſlain by their <hi>Ariſtomenes;</hi> but the <hi>Lacedoemonians</hi> deny it, and ſay, He was only wounded: Be it as it will, 'tis certain at leaſt that <hi>Agis</hi> was the firſt King put to death by the <hi>Epori,</hi> with a form and pretence of Juſtice, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:33760:353"/>
for having endeavour'd to reduce them to their original Inſtitution, a Deſign well becoming the Courage of a noble <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Agis</hi> had the Fortune to be ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Enemies, and worſe by his Friends; for if he had reaſon to complain of <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> whoſe Life he had ſav'd, much more of <hi>Amphares,</hi> in whoſe Friendſhip he repos'd the higheſt Confidence: ſo unmercifully was he dealt with by others, who being himſelf of a moſt mild and generous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, did deſerve to be belov'd by all Mankind.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF CLEOMENES.</head>
            <byline>Tranſlated from the Greek, by Mr. <hi>Creech,</hi> Fellow of <hi>All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Souls</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>THus fell <hi>Agis.</hi> His Brother <hi>Archidamus</hi> was too quick for <hi>Leonidas,</hi> and ſav'd himſelf by a timely Retreat. But his Wife then newly brought to Bed, the Tyrant forc'd her from her own Houſe, and compell'd her to marry his Son <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> though at that time too young for a Wife; for he was unwilling that any one elſe ſhould have her, ſhe being Heireſs to her Father <hi>Gylippus</hi>'s great Eſtate; for Perſon,
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:33760:355"/>
the fineſt Woman in all <hi>Greece,</hi> very good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd, of an exemplary Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they ſay, ſhe did all ſhe could, that ſhe might not be compell'd to this Match.</p>
            <p>Being thus married to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Leonidas,</hi> but to the Youth ſhe ſhow'd her ſelf a kind and obliging Wife. He, as ſoon as they came together, began to love her very much, and the conſtant Kindneſs that ſhe ſtill retain'd for the memory of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,</hi> wrought ſomewhat of Concern in the young Man for him, ſo that he would often enquire of her concerning what had paſs'd, and attentively liſten to the Story of <hi>Agis</hi>'s Deſigns. Now <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had a generous and great Soul; he was as temperate and moderate in his Pleaſures as <hi>Agis,</hi> but not ſo very cautious, circumſpect and gentle: a ſpur of Paſſion always gall'd him, and his eargerneſs to purſue that which he thought good and juſt, was violent and heady: to make Men willing to obey, he conceiv'd to be the beſt Diſcipline; but likewiſe to break the ſtubborn, and force them to be better, was in his opinion commendable and brave. This Diſpoſition made him diſlike the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the City: the Citizens lay diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in ſupine Idleneſs and Pleaſures; the King minded nothing, deſigning, if no body gave him any diſturbance, to waſt his Time in Eaſe and Riot; the Publick was neglected,
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:33760:356"/>
and each Man intent upon his private Gain. 'Twas dangerous, now <hi>Agis</hi> was kill'd, to mention the exerciſing and training of their Youth, and to ſet up for the ancient Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Equality, was Treaſon againſt the State. 'Tis ſaid alſo that <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> whilſt a Boy, ſtudied Philoſophy under <hi>Sphoerus</hi> the <hi>Boryſthenite,</hi> who coming to <hi>Sparta,</hi> was very diligent in inſtructing the Youth. <hi>Spoerus</hi> was one of the chief of <hi>Zeno</hi> the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiean</hi>'s Scholars, and 'tis likely that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd the manly Temper of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and inflam'd his generous Ambition. The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Leonidas</hi> (as Story ſaith) being ask'd, What manner of Poet he thought <hi>Tyrtoeus?</hi> reply'd, An excellent one to whet the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of Youth, for being fill'd with Fury by his Poems, they daringly ventur'd on any Danger: now the <hi>Stoicks</hi> Philoſophy is a dangerous Incentive to hot and fiery Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, but being mixt with a grave and cautious Temper, is very good to fix and ſettle the Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>Upon the Death of his Father <hi>Leonidas,</hi> he ſucceeded, and obſerving the Citizens of all ſorts to be debauch'd, the Rich neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Publick, and intent on their own Gain and Pleaſure, and the Poor being crampt in their private Fortunes, grown unactive, Cowards, and not inclinable to the <hi>Spartan</hi> Inſtitution and way of Breeding, that he
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:33760:356"/>
had only the Name of King, and the <hi>Ephori</hi> all the Power, was reſolv'd to change the preſent poſture of Affairs. He had a Friend whoſe Name was <hi>Xenares,</hi> his Lover (ſuch an Affection the <hi>Spartans</hi> expreſs by the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) him he ſounded, and of him he would commonly enquire, What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of King <hi>Agis</hi> was; by what means, and by what Aſſiſtance he began and purſu'd his Deſigns. <hi>Xenares</hi> at firſt willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with his Requeſt, and told him the whole Story, with all the particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Actions. But when he obſerv'd <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to be extreamly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Relation, and more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily mov'd at <hi>Agis</hi>'s new model of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and begging a repetition of the Story, he at firſt ſeverely chid him, told him, He was frantick, and at laſt left off all ſort of Familiarity and Converſation with him, yet he never told any Man the cauſe of their Diſagreement, but would only ſay, <hi>Cleomenes knew very well. Cleomenes</hi> finding <hi>Xenares</hi> averſe to his Deſigns, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all others to be of the ſame opinion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with none, but contriv'd the whole Buſineſs by himſelf. And conſidering that it would be eaſier to bring about an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when the City was at War, than when in Peace, he engag'd the Commonwealth in a Quarrel with the <hi>Achoeans,</hi> who had given
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:33760:357"/>
them fair occaſions to complain: for <hi>Aratus</hi> a Man of the greateſt Power amongſt all the <hi>Achoeans,</hi> deſign'd from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to bring all the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> into one common Body. And to effect this, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook many Expeditions, and ran through a long courſe of Policy; for he thought this the only means to make them an equal Match for their foreign Enemies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All the reſt agreed to his Propoſals, only the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doemonians,</hi> the <hi>Eleans,</hi> and as many of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> as inclin'd to the <hi>Spartan</hi> Intereſt, refus'd. Therefore as ſoon as <hi>Leonidas</hi> was dead, he fell upon the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe eſpecially that border'd on <hi>Achaia;</hi> by this means deſigning to try the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> and deſpiſing <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> as a Youth, and of no Experience in Affairs of State or War. Upon this the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori</hi> ſent <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to ſurpriſe the <hi>Athenoeum,</hi> (dedicated to <hi>Minerva</hi>) near <hi>Belbina,</hi> which is a Paſs of <hi>Laconia,</hi> and was then under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Megalopolitans: Cleomenes</hi> poſſeſt himſelf of the place, and fortified it; at which Action <hi>Aratus</hi> ſhew'd no publick Reſentment, but marcht by night to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe <hi>Tegea</hi> and <hi>Orchomenium.</hi> The Deſign fail'd; for thoſe that were to betray the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties into his Hands, doubted the Succeſs; ſo <hi>Aratus</hi> retreated, imagining that his Deſign had been undiſcovered: But <hi>Cleomenes</hi> wrot
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:33760:357"/>
a jeering Letter to him, and deſired to know as from a Friend, whither he intended to march at night? And <hi>Aratus</hi> anſwering, That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood his Deſign to fortifie <hi>Belbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> he reſolv'd to march thither to oppoſe him. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> return'd, That he believed it, but deſir'd him to give him an account, if it ſtood with his Convenience, why he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd thoſe Torches and Ladders with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aratus</hi> laughing at the Jeer, and asking what manner of Youth this was; <hi>Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> a <hi>Spartan</hi> Exile, reply'd, <hi>If you have any Deſigns upon the</hi> Lacedaemonians, <hi>begin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this young Eagle's Talons are grown.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after this, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> being in <hi>Arcadia</hi> with a few Horſe, and 300 Foot, the <hi>Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> fearing to engage in the War, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him home; but upon his Retreat, <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> taking <hi>Caphuoe,</hi> they commiſſion'd him again. In this Expedition he took <hi>Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drium,</hi> and ſpoiled the Countrey of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives</hi> and the <hi>Achaians:</hi> to ſtop his Victory, and ſecure their Friends, ſent 20000 Foot and 1000 Horſe againſt him, under the Command of <hi>Ariſtomachus. Cleomenes</hi> fac'd them at <hi>Palantium,</hi> and offer'd Battle: But <hi>Aratus</hi> being daſh'd at his Bravery, would not ſuffer the General to engage, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, being curſt by the <hi>Achoeans,</hi> and hooted at, and ſcorn'd by the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who were not above 5000, for a Coward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="696" facs="tcp:33760:358"/>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> encouraged by this Succeſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to vaunt among the Citizens a Sentence of one of their ancient Kings, who ſaid, <hi>The</hi> Spartans <hi>ſeldom enquired how many their Enemies were, but where they were.</hi> After this, marching to the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Eleans,</hi> upon whom the <hi>Achaians</hi> warr'd, and about <hi>Lycoeum</hi> falling upon the Enemy in their Retreat, he routed their whole Army, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a great number of Captives, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many dead upon the Place; ſo that it was commonly reported amongſt the Greeks that <hi>Aratus</hi> was ſlain. But <hi>Aratus</hi> making the beſt Advantage of the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, preſently after the Defeat, march'd to <hi>Mantinoea,</hi> and before any body ſuſpected it, took the City, and put a new Garriſon into it. Upon this the <hi>Lacedoemonian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s</hi> being quite diſcouraged, and oppoſing <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Deſign of carrying on the War, he was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſend for <hi>Archidamus, Agis</hi>'s Brother from <hi>Meſena,</hi> for he of the other Family had a Right to the Kingdom; and beſide <hi>Cleomenes</hi> thought that the Power of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori</hi> would be abated when the Kingly State was fill'd up, and equally poiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Families. But thoſe that were concern'd in the Murder of <hi>Agis</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Deſign, and fearing that upon <hi>Archidamus</hi>'s Return they ſhould be call'd to an Account, receiv'd him coming
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:33760:358"/>
privately into Town, waited on him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after murder'd him; but whether <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omenes</hi> was againſt it (as <hi>Phylarchus</hi> imagines) or whether he was perſwaded by his Friends, and winck'd at the Contrivance, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; however, they were moſt blam'd, as having forc'd his Conſent. But he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to new-model the State brib'd the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori</hi> to make him General: and won the Affections of many others by means of his Mother <hi>Crateſicloea,</hi> who ſpared no Coſt, and was very zealous to promote the ſame Intereſt; and though of her ſelf ſhe had no Inclination to marry, yet for her Son's ſake ſhe wedded one of the chiefeſt Citizens for Wealth and Power. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> marching forth with the Army now under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, took <hi>Leuctra,</hi> a place belonging to <hi>Megalopolis;</hi> and the <hi>Achoeans</hi> quickly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him with a good body of Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Aratus,</hi> in a Battle under the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Walls of the City, ſome part of his Army was routed. But <hi>Aratus</hi> commanding the <hi>Achoeans</hi> not to paſs a deep Hollow, and ſtopping the Purſuit, <hi>Lydiadas</hi> the <hi>Megalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> fretting at the Orders, encouraging the Horſe which he led, and purſuing the routed Enemy, fell into a place full of Vines, Hedges and Ditches, and being forc'd to break his Ranks, was put into a great Diſorder. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> obſerving the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:33760:359"/>
commanded the <hi>Tarentines</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> to engage him, by whom, after a brave Diſpute he was routed and ſlain. The <hi>Lacedoemonians</hi> thus encouraged, with a great ſhout fell upon the <hi>Archoeans</hi> and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their whole Army. Of the ſlain, which were very many, ſome <hi>Cleomenes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered upon Articles, but the Body of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diadas</hi> he commanded to be brought to him and then putting on it a purple Robe, and a Crown upon its Head, ſent a Convoy with it to the Gates of <hi>Megalopolis.</hi> This <hi>Lydiadas</hi> was the Man that reſign'd his Crown, reſtor'd Liberty to the Citizens, and joyn'd the City to the <hi>Achoean</hi> Intereſt. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> being very much raiſed by this Succeſs; and perſwaded, that if matters were wholly at his Diſpoſal, he ſhould quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be too hard for the <hi>Achoeans.</hi> He taught <hi>Megiſtones</hi> his Mother's Husband, That 'twas expedient for the State to ſhake off the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and to put all their Wealth into one common Stock for the whole Body; That <hi>Sparta</hi> being reſtor'd to its old Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, might be rais'd up to be Miſtriſs of all <hi>Greece. Megiſtones</hi> liked the Deſign, and engag'd two or three more of his Friends. About that time one of the <hi>Ephori</hi> ſleeping in <hi>Phaſiphae</hi>'s Temple, dream'd a very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Dream; for he thought he ſaw the four Chairs removed out of the place where
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:33760:359"/>
the <hi>Ephori</hi> uſed to ſit and hear Cauſes, and one only ſet there; and whilſt he wondred he heard a Voice out of the Temple, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>This is beſt for</hi> Sparta. The Perſon telling <hi>Cleomenes</hi> this Dream, he was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troubled at firſt, fearing that he us'd this as a Trick to ſift him, upon ſome Suſpicion of his Deſign; but when he was ſatisfied that the Relater ſpoke truth, he took heart again, and taking with him thoſe whom he thought would be againſt his model, he took <hi>Eroea</hi> and <hi>Alcoea,</hi> two Cities of the <hi>Achoeans,</hi> furniſh'd <hi>Orchomenium</hi> with Proviſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd <hi>Mantinoea;</hi> and with long marches ſo haraſs'd the <hi>Lacedoemonians,</hi> that many of them deſir'd to be left in <hi>Arcadia;</hi> and he ſatisfy'd their Requeſt. With the Mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he march'd to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and by the way communicated his Deſign to thoſe whom he thought fitteſt for his Purpoſe, and march'd ſlowly that he might catch the <hi>Ephori</hi> at Supper. When he was come near the City, he ſent <hi>Eurycleidas</hi> to the <hi>Suſſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> the eating-place of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> under pretence of carrying ſome Meſſage from him from the Army; <hi>Threicion, Phoebis,</hi> and two of thoſe which were bred with <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> which they call <hi>Samothracoe,</hi> follow'd with a few Souldiers: And whilſt <hi>Eurycleidas</hi> was delivering his Meſſage to the <hi>Ephori,</hi> they ran upon them with their drawn Swords,
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:33760:360"/>
and ſlew them. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> as ſoon as he was run through, fell, and lay as dead; but in a little time he roſe, ſilently convey'd himſelf out of the Room, and crept undiſcover'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a little Houſe, which was the Temple of <hi>Fear,</hi> and which always us'd to be ſhut, but was then by chance open; being got in, he ſhut the Door, and lay cloſe: the other four were kill'd, and above ten more that came to their Aſſiſtance; to thoſe that were qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, they did no harm, ſtopt none that fled the City, and ſpar'd <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> who came out of the Temple the next day. The <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedoemonians</hi> have not only Temples dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Fear,</hi> but alſo to <hi>Death, Laughter,</hi> and the like Paſſions: now they worſhip <hi>Fear,</hi> not as they do thoſe Deities which they dread, eſteeming it hurtful, but think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Polity is chiefly kept up by Law; and therefore the <hi>Ephori (Ariſtotle</hi> is my Author) when they enter upon their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, make Proclamation to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That they ſhould ſhave their Whiskers, and be obedient to the Laws, that they might not be forc'd to be ſevere, uſing this trivial Particular (in my opinion) to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom their Youth to Obedience even in the ſmalleſt Matters. And the Ancients, I think, did not imagine Fortitude to be plain Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs, but a cautious Fear of Infamy and Diſgrace: for thoſe that ſhow moſt Fear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:33760:360"/>
the Laws, are moſt bold againſt their Enemies; and thoſe are leaſt afraid of any Danger, who are moſt afraid of a juſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Therefore he ſaid well:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>A Reverence ſtill attends on Fear.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And <hi>Homer,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Fear'd you ſhall be, dear <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, and rever'd,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And again,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>In ſilence fearing thoſe that bore the ſway.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>For 'tis very commonly ſeen, that Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence thoſe whom they fear; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Lacedoemonians</hi> plac'd the Temple of <hi>Fear</hi> by the <hi>Suſſitium</hi> of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rais'd their Power to almoſt abſolute Monarchy.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Cleomenes</hi> proſcrib'd 80 of the Citizens, whom he thought neceſſary to baniſh, and remov'd all the Seats of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phori</hi> except one, in which he himſelf deſign'd to ſit, and hear Cauſes; and calling the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens together, he made an Apology for his Proceedings, ſaying, That by <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Senate was joyn'd to the Kings, and that that model of Government had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a long time, and needed no other ſort of Magiſtrates to give it perfection. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward in the long War with the <hi>Meſſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> when the Kings being to command the
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:33760:361"/>
Army, had no time to attend civil Cauſes, they choſe ſome of their Friends, and left them to determine the Suits of the Citizens in their ſtead. Theſe were call'd <hi>Ephori,</hi> and at firſt behav'd themſelves as Servants to the Kings, but afterward by degrees they appropriated the Power to themſelves and erected a diſtinct ſort of Magiſtracy. An evidence of the Truth of this may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the uſual Behaviour of the Kings, who upon the firſt and ſecond Meſſage of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> refuſe to go, but upon the third readily attend them: And <hi>Aſteropus,</hi> the firſt that rais'd the <hi>Ephori</hi> to that height of Power, liv'd a great many years after their Inſtitution; therefore whilſt they modeſtly contain'd themſelves within their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Sphere, 'twas better to bear with them than to make a diſturbance. But that an upſtart introduc'd Power ſhould ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the old model of Government, as to baniſh ſome Kings, murder others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing their defence, and threaten thoſe who deſir'd to ſee the beſt and moſt divine Conſtitution reſtor'd in <hi>Sparta,</hi> was unſufferable. Therefore if it had been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him without Bloodſhed, to have freed <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> from thoſe foreign Plagues, Luxury, Vanity, Debts and Uſury; and from thoſe more ancient Evils, Poverty and Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, he ſhould have thought himſelf the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:33760:361"/>
King in the World, having like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Phyſician cur'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Diſeaſes of his Countrey without pain. But now in this neceſſity <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Example favour'd his Proceedings, who being neither King, nor Magiſtrate, but a private Man, and aiming at the Kingdom, came arm'd into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, and for fear of the King, <hi>Carileus</hi> fled to the Altar: but he being a good Man, and a lover of his Countrey, readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Project, and admitted an Alteration in the State. Thus by his own Actions <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſhow'd, That it was difficult to correct the Government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Force and Fear, in uſing which, he ſaid, he would be ſo moderate, as never to deſire their Aſſiſtance, but either to terrifie or ruine the Enemies of <hi>Sparta</hi>'s Happineſs and Safety. He commanded that all the Land ſhould be left in common, and private Claims laid aſide: That Debtors ſhould be diſcharged of their Debts, and a ſtrict ſearch made, who were Foreigners, and who not: That the true <hi>Spartans,</hi> recovering their Courage, might defend the City by their Arms, and that we may no longer ſee <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia,</hi> for want of a ſufficient number to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, waſted by the <hi>Aetolians</hi> and <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Then he himſelf firſt, with his Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law <hi>Megiſtones</hi> and his Friends, brought all their Wealth into one publick Stock, and
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:33760:362"/>
all the other Citizens follow'd the example: the Land was divided, and every one that he had baniſh'd, had a ſhare aſſign'd him; for he promis'd to reſtore all, as ſoon as things were ſettled and in quiet; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating the common number of Citizens, out of the beſt and moſt agreeable of the neighbouring Inhabitants, he rais'd a Body of 4000 Men, and inſtead of a Spear, taught them to uſe a <hi>Sariſſa,</hi> (a long Pike) with both hands, and to carry their Shields by a String faſtned round their Arms, and not by a Handle, as before. After this he began to conſult about the exerciſing and breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Youth, (many Particulars of which, <hi>Sphoerus</hi> being then at <hi>Sparta,</hi> directed) and in a ſhort time the Schools of Exerciſe, and their <hi>Syſſitia,</hi> (common eating Places) reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd their ancient Decency and Order, a few out of neceſſity, but the moſt volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily applying themſelves to that generous and <hi>Laconick</hi> way of Living: beſides, that the Name of Monarch might give them no jealouſie, he made <hi>Eucleidas,</hi> his Brother, Partner in the Throne; and that was the only time that <hi>Sparta</hi> had two Kings of the ſame Family. Then underſtanding that the <hi>Achoeans</hi> and <hi>Aratus</hi> imagin'd that this Change had diſturb'd and ſhaken his Affairs, and that he would not venture out of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and leave the City now unſettled by ſo
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:33760:362"/>
great an Alteration, he thought it great and ſerviceable to his Deſigns, to convince his Enemies that he was eagerly deſirous of a War: And therefore making an Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Territories of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> he waſted the Countrey very much, and got a conſiderable Booty. And at laſt taking thoſe that us'd to act in the publick Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities travelling from <hi>Meſſena,</hi> and building a Theater in the Enemies Countrey, and ſetting a Prize of 40 <hi>l.</hi> value, he ſate Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor a whole day; not that he either deſir'd or needed ſuch a Divertiſement, but as it were inſulting o'er his Enemies, and that by thus manifeſtly deſpiſing them, he might ſhow that he had more than conquer'd the <hi>Achaeans:</hi> for that alone of all the Greek or Kings Armies had no Stage-players, no Jugglers, no dancing or ſinging Women at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, but was free from all ſorts of Looſneſs, Wantonneſs and Foppery; the young Men being for the moſt part upon Duty, and the old Men teaching them at leiſure-time to apply themſelves to their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Drollery, and to rally one another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetiouſly after the <hi>Laconick</hi> faſhion; the Advantages of which I have diſcover'd in the Life of <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> He himſelf inſtructed all by his Example: he was a living Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Temperance before every bodies eyes, and his courſe of Living was neither
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:33760:363"/>
more ſtately nor more expenſive than any of the Commons. And this was a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Advantage to him in his Deſigns on <hi>Greece;</hi> for Men when they waited upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings, did not ſo much admire their Wealth, coſtly Furniture, and numerous Attendance, as they hated their Pride and State, their difficulty of Acceſs, and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful commanding Anſwers to their Petitions. But when they came to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> who was both really a King, and bore that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſaw no Purple, no Robes of State upon him, no Chairs and Couches about him for his eaſe, and that he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Petitions, and return Anſwers after a long delay, by a number of Meſſengers, Waiters, or by Bills, but that he roſe and came forward to meet thoſe that came to wait upon him, ſtaid, talk'd freely and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly with all that had Buſineſs, they were extreamly taken, won to his Service, and profeſs'd that he alone was the true Son of <hi>Hercules.</hi> His common every days Meal was in a mean Room, very ſparing, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Laconick</hi> manner; and when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd Ambaſſadors or Strangers, two more Beds were added, and a little better Dinner provided by his Servants; but no Fricacies, no Dainties, only the diſhes were larger, and the Wine more plentiful; for he reprov'd one of his Friends for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:33760:363"/>
ſome Strangers with nothing but Pulſe and black Broth, ſuch Diet as they uſually had in their <hi>Phiditia,</hi> ſaying, That upon ſuch occaſions, and when they treat Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, 'twas not requiſite to be too exact <hi>Laconians.</hi> After Supper, a Stand was brought in with a braſs Veſſel full of Wine, two ſilver Pots, which held almoſt a Quart apiece, a few ſilver Cups, of which he that pleas'd might drink, but no Liquor was forc'd on any of the Gueſts. There was no Muſick, nor was any requir'd; for he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd the Company, ſometimes asking Queſtions, ſometimes telling Stories: And his Diſcourſe was neither too grave, and unpleaſantly ſerious, nor vain and abuſive, but merrily facetious; for he thought thoſe ways of catching Men by Gifts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, which other Kings uſe, to be mean and inartificial; and it ſeem'd to him to be the moſt glorious method, and moſt ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a King to win the Affections of thoſe that came near him, by pleaſant Diſcourſe, and unaffected Converſation: for a Friend and Mercenary differ only in this, that the one is made by Converſation and agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Humour, and the other by Reward. The <hi>Mantinoeans</hi> were the firſt that oblig'd him; for getting by night into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and driving out the <hi>Achoean</hi> Garriſon, they put themſelves under his Protection:
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:33760:364"/>
he reſtor'd them their Polity and Laws, and the ſame day march'd to <hi>Tegea;</hi> and a little while after fetching a Compaſs through <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadia,</hi> he made a Deſcent upon <hi>Pheroe</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia,</hi> intending to force <hi>Aratus</hi> to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or bring him into Diſrepute, for refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to engage, and ſuffering him to waſte the Countrey: <hi>Hyperbatus</hi> at that time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Army, but <hi>Aratus</hi> had all the Power amongſt the <hi>Achoeans.</hi> The <hi>Achoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> marching forth with their whole Strength, and incamping in <hi>Dumoeoe,</hi> about <hi>Hecatomboeum, Cleomenes</hi> came up, and thinking it not adviſable to pitch between <hi>Dumoeoe,</hi> a City of the Enemies, and the Camp of the <hi>Achoeans,</hi> he boldly dar'd the <hi>Achoeans,</hi> and forc'd them to a Battle, and routing the <hi>Phalanx,</hi> ſlew a great many in the Fight, and took many Priſoners; thence marching to <hi>Lagon,</hi> and driving out the <hi>Achoean</hi> Garriſon, he reſtor'd the City to the <hi>Eloeans.</hi> The Affairs of the <hi>Achoeans</hi> being in this deſperate condition, <hi>Aratus,</hi> who was wont to continue in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment above a year, refus'd the Command, though they entreated and urg'd him to accept it; and this was ill done, when the Storm was high, to put the Power out of his own hands, and ſet another to the Helm. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> at firſt propos'd fair and eaſie Conditions by his Ambaſſadors to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choeans;</hi>
               <pb n="709" facs="tcp:33760:364"/>
but afterward he ſent others, and requir'd the chief Command to be ſettled upon him; and in other Matters he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to agree to reaſonable terms, and to reſtore their Captives and their Countrey. The <hi>Achoeans</hi> were willing to come to an Agreement upon thoſe terms, and invited <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to <hi>Lerna,</hi> where an Aſſembly was to be held; but it hapned that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> haſtily marching on, and unreaſonably drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water, brought up abundance of Blood, and loſt his Voice: therefore being unable to continue his March, he ſent the chiefeſt of the Captives to the <hi>Achoeans,</hi> and putting off the Meeting for ſome time, retir'd to <hi>Lacedoemon.</hi> This ruin'd the Affairs of <hi>Greece,</hi> which was juſt then ready to recover it ſelf out of its Diſaſters, and avoid the inſulting and Covetouſneſs of the <hi>Macedonians:</hi> for <hi>Aratus,</hi> whether fearing or diſtruſting <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> or envying his unlook'd-for Succeſs, or thinking it a diſgrace for him who had commanded 33 years, to have a young Man ſucceed to all his Glory and his Power, and be Head of that Government which he had been raiſing and ſettling ſo many years; he firſt endeavour'd to keep the <hi>Achoeans</hi> from cloſing with <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> but when they would not hearken to him, fearing <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s</hi> daring Spirit and thinking the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doemonian</hi>'s Propoſals to be very reaſonable,
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:33760:365"/>
who deſign'd only to reduce <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> to its old Model, he took his laſt Refuge, in an Action which was unbecoming any of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> moſt diſhonourable to him, and moſt unworthy his former Bravery and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits: for he call'd <hi>Antigonus</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> and fill'd <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> with <hi>Macedonians,</hi> whom he himſelf, when a Youth, having beaten their Garriſon out of the Caſtle of <hi>Corinth,</hi> had driven from the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; beſide, he declar'd himſelf an Enemy to all Kings, and hath left many diſhonourable Stories of this ſame <hi>Antigonus,</hi> in thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries which he wrote. Aud though he declares, that he ſuffer'd conſiderable Loſſes, and underwent great Dangers, that he might free <hi>Athens</hi> from the Power of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> yet afterward he brought the very ſame Men arm'd into his own Countrey, and his own Houſe, even to the Womens Apartment. He would not endure, that one of the Family of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and King of <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and one that had reform'd the Polity of his Countrey, as it were a diſorder'd Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and tun'd it to the plain <hi>Dorick</hi> meaſure of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> to be ſtyl'd, Head of the <hi>Tric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeans</hi> and <hi>Sicyonians;</hi> and whilſt he fled the Pulſe and ſhort Coat, and, which were his chief Accuſations againſt <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Wealth, and reformation of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, he baſely ſubjected himſelf, together
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:33760:365"/>

            <p>I write this not out of any Deſign to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace <hi>Aratus</hi> (for in many things he ſhew'd himſelf vigorous for the <hi>Grecian</hi> Intereſt, and a great Man) but out of pity to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Humane Nature, which, in ſuch a Perſon ſo excellent, and ſo many ways diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to Vertue, cannot attain to a State ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprehenſible. The <hi>Achoeans</hi> meeting again at <hi>Argos,</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> deſcending from <hi>Tegea,</hi> there were great hopes that all Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences would be compos'd. But <hi>Aratus, Antigonus,</hi> and He having already agreed upon the chief Articles of their League, fearing that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> would carry all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and either win, or force the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to comply with his Demands, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that having three hundred Hoſtages put into his Hands, he ſhould come alone into the Town, or bring his Army to the place of Exerciſe, call'd <hi>Cillarabion,</hi> without the City, and treat there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cleomenes</hi> hearing this, ſaid, That he was unjuſtly dealt with; for they ought to have
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:33760:366"/>
told him ſo plainly at firſt, and not now he was come even to their Doors, ſhow their Jealouſie, and deny him Admiſſion: And writing an Epiſtle to the <hi>Achoeans</hi> about the ſame Subject; the greateſt part of which was an Accuſation of <hi>Aratus;</hi> and <hi>Aratus,</hi> on the other ſide, ripping up his Faults to the Aſſembly, he haſtily diſlodg'd; and ſent a Trumpeter to denounce War againſt the <hi>Achoeans,</hi> but not to <hi>Argos,</hi> but to <hi>Aegium,</hi> as <hi>Aratus</hi> delivers, that he might not give them notice enough to make Proviſion for their Defence. Upon this, the <hi>Achoeans</hi> were mightily diſturb'd, the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expecting a Diviſion of the Land, and a Releaſe from their Debts; and the chief Men being on many Accounts diſpleas'd with <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and ſome angry and at odds with him, as the Occaſion of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> deſcent on <hi>Peloponneſus.</hi> Encouraged by theſe Miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> invades <hi>Achoea;</hi> and firſt took <hi>Pellene</hi> by ſurpriſe, and beat out the <hi>Achoean</hi> Garriſon; and afterward brought over <hi>Pheneon</hi> and <hi>Penteloeon</hi> to his ſide. Now the <hi>Achoeans</hi> ſuſpecting ſome treacherous Deſigns at <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Sicyon,</hi> ſent their Horſe and Mercenaries out of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos</hi> to have an Eye upon thoſe Cities, and they themſelves went to <hi>Argos</hi> to celebrate the <hi>Nemean</hi> Games. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> advertis'd of this march, and hoping (as it afterward
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:33760:366"/>
fell out) that upon an unexpected Advance to the City now buſied in the Solemnity of the Games, and throng'd with nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spectators, he ſhould raiſe a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Terror and Confuſion amongſt them; by night he march'd with his Army to the Walls, and taking the quarter of the Town call'd <hi>Aſpis,</hi> which lies above the Theater, a place well fortify'd, and hard to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, he ſo terrify'd them, that none of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to reſiſt, but agreed to accept a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, to give twenty Citizens for Hoſtages, and to aſſiſt the <hi>Lacedoemonians,</hi> and that he ſhould have the chief Command. This A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction conſiderably encreas'd his Reputation, and his Power; for the ancient <hi>Spartan</hi> Kings, though they many ways endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to effect it, could never bring <hi>Argos</hi> to be ſtedfaſtly and ſincerely theirs. And <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> a moſt experienc'd Captain, and brave Souldier, though he enter'd the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by force, could not keep Poſſeſſion, but was ſlain himſelf with a conſiderable part of his Army: Therefore they admir'd the Diſpatch and Contrivance of <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> and thoſe that before derided him for ſaying that he imitated <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in releaſing the People from their Debts, and in equally dividing the Wealth of the Citizens, were now perſwaded that he was the cauſe of the deſirable Alterations in the <hi>Spartan</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth:
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:33760:367"/>
For before they were very low in the World, and ſo unable to ſecure their own, that the <hi>Aetolians</hi> invading <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia,</hi> brought away fifty thouſand Slaves; (ſo that one of the elder <hi>Spartans</hi> is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have ſaid, That <hi>they had done</hi> Laconia <hi>a kindneſs by unburdening it</hi>) and yet a little while after applying themſelves to their own Cuſtoms, and ancient Inſtitution, they gave notable Inſtances of Courage and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, as if they had been under the Eye of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> himſelf; and quickly rais'd <hi>Sparta</hi> to be Head of all <hi>Greece,</hi> and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd <hi>Peloponneſus</hi> to themſelves. Whilſt <hi>Argos</hi> was taken, and <hi>Cleonoe</hi> and <hi>Phlius</hi> ſided with <hi>Cleomenes, Aratus</hi> was at <hi>Corinth</hi> ſearching after ſome, who were reported to favour the <hi>Spartan</hi> Intereſt. The News being brought to him, diſturb'd him very much; for he perceiv'd the City inclining to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and the <hi>Achoeans</hi> willing to be at eaſe; therefore he call'd all the Citizens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the common Hall, and, as it were, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſignedly retreating to the Gate, he moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Horſe that ſtood ready there, and fled to <hi>Sicyon;</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> made ſuch haſt to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> at <hi>Argos,</hi> that (as <hi>Aratus</hi> ſays) ſtriving who ſhould be firſt there, they ſpoil'd all their Horſes: And <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was very angry with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for letting <hi>Aratus</hi> eſcape: And <hi>Megiſtones</hi> came
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:33760:367"/>
from <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to him, deſiring him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Caſtle of <hi>Corinth,</hi> which was then garriſon'd by the <hi>Achoeans,</hi> and offer'd him a conſiderable Sum of Money; and that he anſwered, That <hi>Matters were not now in his Power, but he in theirs.</hi> Thus <hi>Aratus</hi> himſelf writes. But <hi>Cleomenes</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching from <hi>Argos,</hi> and taking in the <hi>Troe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenians, Epidaurians,</hi> and <hi>Hermioneans,</hi> came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> and block'd up the Caſtle which the <hi>Achoeans</hi> would not ſurrender; and ſending for <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Friends and Stewards, committed his Houſe and Eſtate to their Care and Management; and ſent <hi>Tritimal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the <hi>Meſſenian</hi> to him a ſecond time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that the Caſtle might be equally gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon'd by the <hi>Spartans</hi> and <hi>Achoeans,</hi> and promiſing to <hi>Aratus</hi> himſelf double the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that he receiv'd from King <hi>Ptolemy:</hi> But <hi>Aratus</hi> refuſing the Conditions, and ſending his own Son with other Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and perſwading the <hi>Achoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to make a Decree for delivering the Caſtle into <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Hands, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Territory of the <hi>Sicyonians,</hi> and by a Decree of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſeiz'd on all <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Eſtate. In the mean time <hi>Antigonus,</hi> with a great Army, paſs'd <hi>Gerania,</hi> and <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> thinking it more adviſable to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and garriſon, not the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> but the Mountains called <hi>Onia,</hi> and by a long Siege
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:33760:368"/>
and Skirmiſhes to weary the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> than to venture a ſet Battle, put his Deſign in Execution, which very much diſtreſs'd <hi>Antigonus;</hi> for he had not brought Victuals ſufficient for his Army; nor was it eaſie to force a way through whilſt <hi>Cleomenes</hi> guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Paſs. He attempted by night to paſs through <hi>Lechoeum,</hi> but fail'd, and loſt ſome Men; ſo that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> and his Army, were mightily encouraged, and ſo fluſht with the Victory, that they went merrily to Supper; and <hi>Antigonus</hi> was very much dejected, being reduc'd to thoſe miſerable ſtraits. At laſt he deſign'd to march to the Promontory <hi>Heroeum,</hi> and thence tranſport his Army in Boats to <hi>Sicyon,</hi> which would take up a great deal of time, and be very chargeable. The ſame time about Evening ſome of <hi>Aratus</hi>'s Friends came from <hi>Argos</hi> by Sea, and invited him to return, for the <hi>Argives</hi> would revolt from <hi>Cleomenes. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> was the Man that wrought the Revolt; and he had no hard task to perſwade the common People; for they were all angry with <hi>Cleomenes</hi> for not releaſing them from theirs Debts as they expected. Upon this Advertiſement <hi>Aratus</hi> with fifteen hundred of <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Souldiers ſail'd to <hi>Epidaurus;</hi> but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> not ſtaying for his coming, drew out the Citizens, and fought againſt the Garriſon of the Caſtle, and <hi>Timoxenus</hi>
               <pb n="717" facs="tcp:33760:368"/>
with the <hi>Achoeans</hi> from <hi>Sicyon,</hi> came to his Aſſiſtance. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> heard the News a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſecond Watch of the Night, and ſending for <hi>Megiſtones</hi> angrily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to go and ſet things right at <hi>Argos.</hi> This <hi>Megiſtones</hi> was the Man who paſs'd his word for the <hi>Argives</hi> Loyalty, and perſwaded him not to baniſh the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. This <hi>Megiſtones</hi> he diſpatch'd with two thouſand Souldiers, and obſerv'd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> himſelf, and encouraged the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> pretending that there was no great matter in the Stirs at <hi>Argos,</hi> but only a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Diſturbance rais'd by a few inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons. But when <hi>Megiſtones,</hi> entring <hi>Argos,</hi> was ſlain, and the Garriſon could ſcarce hold out, and frequent Meſſengers came to <hi>Cleomenes</hi> for Succours, he fearing leſt the Enemy having taken <hi>Argos,</hi> ſhould ſhut up the Paſſes, and ſecurely waſte <hi>Laconia,</hi> and beſiege <hi>Sparta</hi> it ſelf, which he had left without Forces; he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodg'd from <hi>Corinth,</hi> and preſently loſt that City; for <hi>Antigonus</hi> entred it, and garriſon'd the Town. He turn'd aſide from his direct March, and aſſaulting the Wall of <hi>Argos,</hi> endeavour'd to break in; and having clear'd a way under the quarter called <hi>Aſpis,</hi> he joyn'd the Garriſon which ſtill held out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Achoeans;</hi> ſome parts of the City he ſcal'd, and took, and his <hi>Cretan</hi> Archers
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:33760:369"/>
clear'd the Streets. But when he ſaw <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> with his <hi>Phalanx</hi> deſcending from the Mountains into the Plain, and the Horſe on all ſides entring the City, he thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to maintain his Poſt, and therefore with all his Men made a ſafe Retreat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Wall. Having in a ſhort time rais'd himſelf to a conſiderable height, and in one March made himſelf Maſter of almoſt all <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and loſt all again in as ſhort a time: For ſome of his Allies preſently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him, and others not long after put themſelves under <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Protection. His Army thus defeated, as he was leading back the Relicks of his Forces, ſome from <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doemon</hi> met him in the Evening at <hi>Tegea,</hi> and brought him News of as great a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune as that which he had lately ſuffer'd, and that was the Death of his Wife, whom he doted on ſo much, that when he was moſt proſperous, he would ever now and then make a ſtep to <hi>Sparta,</hi> to viſit his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Aegiatis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This News afflicted him extreamly, and he griev'd, as a young Man would do for the loſs of a very beautifull and excellent Wife; yet his paſſion did not debaſe the greatneſs of his Mind, but keeping his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Voice, his Countenance and his Habit, he gave neceſſary Orders to his Captains, and took care to ſecure the <hi>Tegeans.</hi> The
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:33760:369"/>
next day he retir'd to <hi>Sparta,</hi> and having at home with his Mother and Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd the loſs, and finiſh'd his Mourning, he preſently appear'd about the publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the State. Now <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> promis'd him Aſſiſtance, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Mother and Children for Hoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: this for ſome conſiderable time he was aſham'd to diſcover to his Mother; and though he often went to her on purpoſe, and was juſt upon the Diſcourſe, yet ſtill refrain'd, and kept it to himſelf? ſo that ſhe began to ſuſpect ſomewhat, and ask'd his Friends, Whether <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to ſay to her, which he was afraid to ſpeak! At laſt <hi>Cleomenes</hi> venturing to tell her, ſhe laugh'd heartily, and ſaid, <hi>Was this the thing that you had often a mind to tell me; and was afraid? Why do not you put me on ſhip board, and ſend this Carkaſe where it may be moſt ſervicable to</hi> Sparta, <hi>before Age waſtes it unprofitably here?</hi> Therefore all things being provided for the Voyage, thy went to <hi>Toenarus</hi> on Foot, and the Army waited on them. <hi>Crateſicloea,</hi> when ſhe was ready to go on Board, took <hi>Cleomenes</hi> aſide into <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Temple, and embracing him who was very much dejected, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſcompos'd, ſhe ſaid thus, <hi>Go to King of</hi> Sparta; <hi>when we are without door, let none ſee us weep, or ſhow any Paſſion below</hi>
               <pb n="720" facs="tcp:33760:370"/>
               <hi>the Honour and Dignity of</hi> Sparta; <hi>for that alone is in our own power; as for Succeſs or Diſappointments, thoſe wait on us as the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty decrees.</hi> Having ſaid thus, and compos'd her Countenance, ſhe went to the Ship with her little Grandſon, and bad the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot put preſently out to Sea. When ſhe came to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and underſtood that <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemy</hi> entertain'd Propoſals and Overtures of Peace from <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and that <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> though the <hi>Achoeans</hi> invited and urg'd him to an Agreement, was afraid, for her ſake, to come to any, without <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s conſent, ſhe wrote to him, adviſing him to do that which was moſt becoming and moſt profitable for <hi>Sparta,</hi> and not for the ſake of an old Woman and a little Child, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtand in fear of <hi>Ptolemy:</hi> this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter ſhe maintain'd in her Misfortunes. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> having taken <hi>Tegea,</hi> and plunder'd <hi>Orchomenum</hi> and <hi>Mantinoea, Cleomenes</hi> was ſhut up within the narrow Bounds of <hi>Laconia,</hi> and made ſuch of the <hi>Heilots</hi> as could pay five <hi>Attick</hi> pounds, free of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and by that means got together 500 Talents; and arming 2000 after the <hi>Macedonian</hi> faſhion, that he might make a Body fit to oppoſe <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s <hi>Leucaſpidoe</hi> (white-Shields) he undertook a very conſiderable and very ſurpriſing Enterprize. <hi>Megalopolis</hi> was at that time a City of it ſelf, as big and as
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:33760:370"/>
powerful as <hi>Sparta,</hi> and had the Forces of the <hi>Achoeans</hi> and <hi>Antigonus</hi> incamping on its ſides; and it was chiefly the <hi>Megalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi> doing, that <hi>Antigonus</hi> was call'd in to aſſiſt the <hi>Achoeans. Cleomenes</hi> having a deſign upon this City, (no Action was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more ſudden and more unexpected) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his Men to take five days Proviſion, and ſo march'd to <hi>Sellaſia,</hi> as if he intended to ſpoil the Countrey of the <hi>Argives:</hi> but from thence making a deſcent into the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> and refreſhing his Army about <hi>Rhoetium,</hi> he march'd through <hi>Helicon,</hi> directly to the City. When he was not far off the Town, he ſent <hi>Panteus</hi> with two Regiments to ſurprize the <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrgion,</hi> (the Quarter between the two Towers) which he underſtood to be the moſt unguarded Quarter of the <hi>Megalopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> Fortifications; and with the reſt of his Forces he follow'd leiſurely. <hi>Panteus,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriz'd that Place, but finding a great part of the Wall without Guards, he pull'd down ſome places, and demoliſh'd others, and kill'd all the Defenders that he found. Whilſt he was thus buſied, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> came up to him, and was got with his Army within the City, before the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> knew of the Surprize: At laſt, as ſoon as it was diſcover'd, ſome left the Town im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, taking with them what Money
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:33760:371"/>
they had ready; ſome arm'd, and engag'd the Enemy; and though they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beat them out, yet they gave their Citizens time and opportunity ſafely to retire: ſo that there were not above 1000 Perſons left in the Town, all the reſt fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Wives and Children, and eſcaping to <hi>Meſſena.</hi> A great number of thoſe that arm'd and fought the Enemy, were ſav'd, and very few taken, amongſt whom were <hi>Lyſandridas</hi> and <hi>Thearidas,</hi> two Men of great Power and Reputation amongſt the <hi>Megalopolitans;</hi> and therefore the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as ſoon as they were taken, brought them to <hi>Cleomenes:</hi> And <hi>Lyſandridas,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw <hi>Cleomenes</hi> afar off, cry'd out, <hi>Now, King of</hi> Sparta, <hi>'tis in your power, by doing a moſt Kingly and braver Action than you have already perform'd, to purchaſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Glory.</hi> And <hi>Cleomenes</hi> gueſſing at his meaning, reply'd, <hi>What do you ſay,</hi> Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandridas, <hi>ſure you will not adviſe me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore your City to you again? 'Tis that which I mean,</hi> Lyſandridas <hi>reply'd, and I adviſe you not to ruine ſo brave a City, but to fill it with faithful and ſtedfaſt Friends and Allies, by reſtoring their Countrey to the</hi> Megalopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans, <hi>and being the Saviour of ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a People. Cleomenes</hi> paus'd a while, and then ſaid, <hi>'Tis very hard to truſt ſo far in theſe Matters; but with us let Profit always</hi>
               <pb n="723" facs="tcp:33760:371"/>
               <hi>yield to Glory.</hi> Having ſaid this, he ſent the two Men to <hi>Meſſena</hi> with a Trumpeter from himſelf, offering the <hi>Megalopolitans</hi> their City again, if they would forſake the <hi>Achoean</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and be on his ſide. Though <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> made theſe kind and obliging Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, yet <hi>Philopoemen</hi> would not ſuffer them to break their League with the <hi>Achoeans;</hi> and accuſing <hi>Cleomenes</hi> to the People, as if his deſign was not to reſtore the City, but to take the Citizens too, he forc'd <hi>Theari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> and <hi>Lyſandridas</hi> to leave <hi>Meſſena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was that <hi>Philopoemen</hi> who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Chief of the <hi>Achoeans,</hi> and a Man of the greateſt Reputation amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as I have made it appear in his own Life. This News coming to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> though he had before taken ſuch ſtrict care that the City ſhould not be plunder'd, yet then being in a Fury, and put out of all patience, he rifled them of all their Coin, Plate and Jewels, and ſent their Statues and Pictures unto <hi>Sparta;</hi> and demolliſhing a great part of the City, he march'd away, for fear of <hi>Antigonus</hi> and the <hi>Achoeans:</hi> but they never ſtirr'd, for they were in <hi>Aegium,</hi> at a Council of War. There <hi>Aratus</hi> mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Desk, wept along while, and held his Mantle before his Face; and at laſt the Company being amaz'd, and commanding him, to ſpeak, he ſaid, <hi>Megalopolis is ruin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d</hi>
               <pb n="724" facs="tcp:33760:372"/>
               <hi>by Cleomenes.</hi> The Aſſembly was preſently diſſolv'd, the <hi>Achoeans</hi> being extreamly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd at the ſuddenneſs and greatneſs of the loſs; and <hi>Antigonus</hi> intending to ſend ſpeedy Succours, when he found his Army to gather very ſlowly out of their Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters, he ſent them Orders to continue there ſtill; and he himſelf march'd to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos</hi> with a conſiderable Body of Men. The ſecond enterprize of <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſeem'd to be carry'd on by extream Boldneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Madneſs; but yet in <hi>Polybius</hi>'s opinion, was done upon mature Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and exact Fore-ſight: for knowing very well that the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were diſpers'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Winter-quarters, and that <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> with his Friends and a few Mercenaries about him winter'd in <hi>Argos;</hi> upon theſe Conſiderations he invaded the Countrey of the <hi>Argives,</hi> hoping to ſhame <hi>Antigonus</hi> to a Battle upon unequal terms; or elſe if he did not dare to Fight, to bring him into Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the <hi>Achoeans.</hi> And this accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hapned; for <hi>Cleomenes</hi> waſting, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and ſpoyling the whole Countrey, the <hi>Argives</hi> vex'd at the loſs, ran in Troops to the Palace of the King, and clamour'd that he ſhould either fight, or ſurrender his Command to better and braver Men. But <hi>Antigonus,</hi> as became an experienc'd Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, accounting it diſhonourable, fooliſhly

to hazzard his Army, and quit his Security, and not ſo to be abus'd and rail'd at by the Rabble, would not march out againſt <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi> but ſtood fix'd to the Deſigns which he had laid: <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in the mean time brought his Army up to the very Walls, and having uncontroul'dly ſpoil'd the Countrey, and inſulted o'er his Enemies, drew off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. A little while after being advertis'd that <hi>Antigonus</hi> deſign'd for <hi>Tegea,</hi> and thence to make an Incurſion into <hi>Laconia,</hi> he haſtily march'd with his Army another way, and appear'd early in the morning before <hi>Argos,</hi> and waſted the Fields about it: the Corn he did not cut down with Reaping hooks and Sythes, as Men uſually do, but beat it down with great Staves made like Scymetars, as if with a great deal of Contempt and wanton Scorn he ſpoyl'd the Fields, and waſted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in his March; yet when his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would have ſet <hi>Cyllabaris,</hi> the School of Exerciſe, on fire, he hindred the Attempt, reflecting upon ſerious conſideration, that the Outrages committed at <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> were the effects of his Paſſion rather than his Wiſdom. He pretended to make ſuch little account of, and ſo much to deſpiſe <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who firſt retir'd to <hi>Argos,</hi> and afterwards plac'd Garriſons on all the Mountains round about, that he ſent a
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:33760:373"/>
Trumpeter to deſire the Keys of the <hi>Heroe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, (Juno</hi>'s Temple) that he might ſacrifice to the Goddeſs. Thus with a Scoff and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reflection on <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd to the Goddeſs, under the Walls of the Temple, which was ſhut, he march'd to <hi>Phlius;</hi> and from thence driving out thoſe that garriſon'd <hi>Hologountum,</hi> he march'd down to <hi>Orchomenum.</hi> And theſe Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes not only encouraged the Citizens, but made him appear, to the very Enemies to be an experienc'd Captain and very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Command: for with the Strength of one City, not only to fight the Power of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and all the <hi>Peloponneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> not only to preſerve <hi>Laconia</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoyl'd, but to waſte the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to take ſo many and ſuch conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Cities, is an Argument of no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bravery. He that firſt ſaid, <hi>That Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was the ſinews of Affairs,</hi> ſeem'd chiefly in that ſaying to reſpect War: And <hi>Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> when the <hi>Athenians</hi> had voted that a Navy ſhould be made ready, but had no Money, ſaid, <hi>They ſhould make Bread before they thought of Sayling.</hi> And the old <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus,</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Peloponneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> War, when the Allies deſir'd, that each Parties ſhare of Contributions for the War ſhould be determin'd, is reported to have ſaid, <hi>War cannot be kept to a ſet Diet:</hi> For
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:33760:373"/>
as well-breath'd Wreſtlers do in time weary and tire out the moſt active and moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Combatant; ſo <hi>Antigonus</hi> coming to the War with a great ſtock of Wealth, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd out <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> whoſe Poverty made it difficult for him either to provide Pay for the Mercenaries, or Proviſions for the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. For in all other Reſpects the time favour'd <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> for <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s Affairs at home began to be diſturb'd: for the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> waſted and over-ran <hi>Macedonia</hi> whilſt he was abſent; and at that time a vaſt Army of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> came down: to be freed from whoſe Outrages, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> ſent for <hi>Antigonus,</hi> and the Letters had almoſt been brought to him before the Battel was fought; upon the receipt of which he preſently diſlodg'd, and left the <hi>Achoeans</hi> Affairs to themſelves. But Fortune, that loves to determine the greateſt Affairs by a Minute, in this Conjuncture ſhow'd ſuch an exact niceneſs of Time, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the Battel in <hi>Sellaſia</hi> was over, and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> had loſt his Army and his City, the Meſſengers reach'd <hi>Antigonus.</hi> And this made <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Misfortune more to be pitied; for if he had forborn fighting two days longer, there had been no need of hazarding a Battel, ſince upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> he might have had what Conditions he pleas'd from the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choeans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="728" facs="tcp:33760:374"/>
But now (as I hinted before) for want of Money, being neceſſitated to rely whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his Arms, he was forc'd with 20000 (this is <hi>Polybius</hi>'s Account) to engage thirty thouſand; and approving himſelf an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commander in this Difficulty, his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens ſhowing an extraordinary Courage, and his Mercenaries Bravery enough; he was overborn by the different way of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the weight of the Arm'd <hi>Phalanx.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Phylarchus</hi> affirms, that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of ſome about him was the chief Cauſe of <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Ruine. For <hi>Antigonus</hi> gave Orders, that the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Achar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanians</hi> ſhould march round by a ſecret way, and encompaſs the other Wing which <hi>Euclei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, Cleomenes</hi>'s Brother, commanded; and then drew out the reſt of his Forces to the Battel. And <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> from a convenient riſing, viewing his Order, and not ſeeing any of the <hi>Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Acharnanians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuſpect that <hi>Antigonus</hi> had ſent them upon ſome ſuch Deſign; and calling for <hi>Damoteles,</hi> who was to inſpect, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt Ambuſhes, commanded him carefully to look after, and diſcover the Enemies Deſigns upon his Rear.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Damoteles</hi> (for ſome ſay <hi>Antigonus</hi> had brib'd him) telling him, that he ſhould not be ſollicitous about that matter, for all was well enough, but mind, and fight thoſe
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:33760:374"/>
that met him in the front. He was ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and advanc'd againſt <hi>Antigonus;</hi> and by the Vigorous Charge of his <hi>Spartans,</hi> made the <hi>Macedonian Phalanx</hi> give ground, and preſs'd upon them with great Advantage about half a mile; but then making a ſtand, and ſeeing the danger which the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wing commanded by his Brother <hi>Euclei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> was in, he cry'd out, <hi>Thou art loſt, dear Brother, thou art loſt, thou brave Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to our</hi> Spartan <hi>Youth, and Theme of our Matron</hi>'s <hi>Songs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eucleidas</hi>'s Wing being thus cut in Pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Conquerors from that part fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Battel, he perceiv'd his Souldiers to be diſorder'd, and unable to maintain the Fight, and therefore provided for his own ſafety. When he came into the City, he adviſed thoſe Citizens that he met, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Antigonus;</hi> and as for himſelf, he ſaid, which ſhould appear moſt advantageous to <hi>Sparta,</hi> whether his Life or Death, that he would chuſe. Seeing the Women running out to thoſe that fled with him, taking their Arms, and bringing Drink to them, he entred into his own Houſe, and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which was a free-born Woman, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from <hi>Megalopolis</hi> after his Wife's Death, offering, as ſhe us'd to do, to make neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Proviſion for him returning from the Battel; though he was very thirſty, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:33760:375"/>
to drink, and though very weary, to ſit down; but arm'd as he was, he clapt his Arm ſide-way to a Pillar, and leaning his Forehead upon his Elbow, he reſted his Body a little while, and ran over in his Thoughts what courſe he ſhould take, and then with his Friends went preſently to <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thium;</hi> where finding Ships fitted for the Purpoſe, they embark'd. <hi>Antigonus</hi> taking the City, treated the <hi>Lacedoemonians</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and neither affronting, nor ruining the Dignity of <hi>Sparta,</hi> but permitting them to enjoy their own Laws and Polity, and ſacrificing to the Gods, diſlodg'd the third day: for he heard that there was a great War kindled in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and that the Country was ſpoyl'd by the Barbarians; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he grew ſick of a Conſumption and continual Defluxion on the Lungs, yet he ſtill kept up that he might return and free his own Country, and fall more gloriouſly upon an heap of ſlaughter'd Barbarians. As <hi>Phylarchus</hi> ſays, and 'tis probable, he broke a Vein by ſhouting in the Battel. In the Plays 'twas ſaid, that after the Victory he cry'd out for Joy, <hi>O fine Day!</hi> and preſently bringing up abundance of Blood, fell into a Fever, and dy'd in a ſhort time.

Is it that inſtead of one, we might appear meaner than two, whilſt we fly</hi> Antigonus, <hi>and flatter</hi> Ptolomy? <hi>Or, is it for your Mother's ſake that you retreat to</hi> Aegypt? <hi>It will indeed be a very fine, and very deſirable ſight for her to be ſhown her Son by</hi> Ptolomy's <hi>Women, now chang'd from a Prince into an exile and a Slave.

Thus ſpoke <hi>Therycion;</hi> and this was <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Reply; <hi>By ſeeking Death, you Coward, the moſt eaſie, and moſt ready Refuge, you fanſie that you ſhall appear coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous and brave, though this Flight is baſer than thy former. Better Men than we have given way to their Enemies, having been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by Fortune, or oppreſs'd by Multitude; but he that ſinks under Labour or Afflictions, the Opinions or Reproaches of Men, is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by his own Effeminacy and Softneſs: For a voluntary Death ought not to be choſen as a Relief from Action, but as an Exemplary Action it ſelf, and 'tis baſe either to live or to die only to our ſelves. That death to which you now invite us, is propos'd only as a releaſe from our preſent Miſeries, but carries nothing of Bravery or Profit in it. And I think it becomes both me and you not to deſpair of our Country; but when there are no hopes of that left, thoſe that have an Inclination may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die.</hi> To this <hi>Therycion</hi> return'd no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but as ſoon as he could get out of <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Company, went toward the Shore, and ran himſelf through.

ſailed from <hi>Aegialia,</hi> landed in <hi>Libya,</hi> and being honourably conducted through the King's Country, came to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> When he was firſt brought to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> no more than common Civilities, and uſual Ceremonies were paid him; but when; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tryal, he found him a Man of deep Senſe, and great Reaſon, and that his plain <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> way of Converſation carried a free Pleaſantneſs with it, that he did nothing unbecoming the greatneſs of his Birth, nor bent under Fortune, and appear'd a more faithful Councellor, than thoſe who made it their buſineſs to pleaſe and flatter; he was aſham'd, and repented that he had neglected ſo great a Man, and ſuffer'd <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> to get ſo much Power and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ruining him. Therefore he heap'd up Honours and Kindneſſes on <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and gave him Hopes that he would furniſh him with an Army and a Navy to recover <hi>Greece,</hi> and re-inſtate him in is Throne. Beſides, he allow'd him a yearly Penſion of four and twenty Talents; a little part of which Sum ſupply'd his and his Friends thrifty Temperance; and the reſt was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in doing good Offices to, and in relieving the Neceſſities of thoſe that fled <hi>Greece,</hi> and retir'd into <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the elder <hi>Ptolomy</hi> dying before <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>'s Affairs had receiv'd a full Diſpatch,
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:33760:377"/>
and the Succeſſor being a looſe, voluptuous and effeminate Prince, under the power of his Pleaſures and his Women, his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was neglected: for the King was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with his Women and his Wine, that Balls, Muſick and Dancing, were the only Employments of his moſt buſie and ſerious hours, and the greateſt Affairs of State were managed by <hi>Agathoclea</hi> the King's Miſtreſs, her Mother, and the Pimp <hi>Oinanthes.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the firſt they ſeem'd to ſtand in need of <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> for <hi>Ptolomy</hi> being afraid of his Brother <hi>Magas,</hi> who by his Mother's means had a great Intereſt amongſt the Souldiers, took <hi>Cleomenes</hi> into his Cabinet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Council, and acquainted him with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of taking off his Brother.

<pb n="735" facs="tcp:33760:377"/>
(<hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Weakneſs increaſing his Fear, and, as it uſually happens, where there is no Judgment and Wiſdom at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, placing his Security in Jealouſie and Suſpicion) rendred <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſuſpected to the Courtiers, as having too much Intereſt with the Mercenaries; and many had this Saying in their mouths, <hi>That he was a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on midſt a flock of Sheep:</hi> for ſuch he ſeem'd to be in the Court, ſlyly overlooking and taking notice of the management of Affairs; therefore when he deſir'd a Navy and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from the King, his Petition was reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But when he underſtood that <hi>Antigonus</hi> was dead, that the <hi>Achoeans</hi> were engaged in a War with the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> being now in very great Diſtraction and Diſtreſs, requir'd and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Aſſiſtance, he deſir'd leave to depart only with his Friends, but could not obtain that, the King not ſo much as hearing his Petition, being ſhut up amongſt his Women, and waſting his Hours in Debauchery and Frolicks. But <hi>Soſibius,</hi> the chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State, thought that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> being detain'd againſt his will, would grow ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable and dangerous, and yet that it was not ſafe to let him go, being an aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> daring Man, and well acquainted with the Diſeaſes and Weakneſs of the Kingdom; for no Preſents, no Gifts, could win him

to a Compliance. But as the Ox <hi>Apis,</hi> though revelling in all poſſible plenty and delight, yet deſires to live as nature would provide for him, to be at liberty, and frisk about the Fields, and can ſcarce endure to be under the Prieſts keeping; ſo he could not brook their Courtſhip, and tender Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but like <hi>Achilles.</hi>

            <p>His Affairs ſtanding in this condition, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cagoras</hi> the <hi>Meſſenian</hi> came to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a Man that deeply hated <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be his Friend; for he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſold <hi>Cleomenes</hi> a fair Eſtate, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receiv'd the Money, becauſe <hi>Cleomenes</hi> was either unable, (as it may be) or elſe by reaſon of his engagement in the Wars and other Diſtractions, had no time to pay him. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſeeing him landing, (for he was then walking upon the Key) kindly ſaluted him, and ask'd, <hi>What Buſineſs brought him to</hi> Aegypt? <hi>Nicagoras</hi> return'd his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, and told him, <hi>That he came to bring ſome excellent War-horſes to the King.</hi> And <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with a Smile ſubjoyn'd, <hi>I wiſh you had rather brought Pimps, Whores and Pathicks; for thoſe now are the King's chief Delight. Nicagoras</hi> at the preſent ſmil'd at the Conceit; but a few days after
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:33760:378"/>
he put <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in mind of the Eſtate that he had bought of him, and deſir'd his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, proteſting that he would not have troubled him, if his Merchandize had turn'd to that Account, which he thought it would. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> reply'd, That he had not a penny left of all that had been given him: At which Anſwer <hi>Nicagoras</hi> being nettled, told <hi>Soſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Cleomenes</hi>'s Scoff upon the King. He careſs'd him for the Diſcovery, but deſiring to have ſome greater Reaſon to excite the King againſt <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> perſwaded <hi>Nicagoras</hi> to leave a Letter written againſt <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> importing that he had a Deſign, if he could have gotten Ships and Souldiers, to ſurprize <hi>Cyrene: Nicagoras</hi> wrote ſuch a Letter, and left <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Four days after <hi>Soſibius</hi> brought the Letter to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> pretending it was juſt then delivered him, and with a bitter Invective excited the Fury of the Youth; upon this it was agreed, that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſhould be invited into a large Apartment and treated as formerly, but not ſuffer'd to go out again: this Uſage was grievous to <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> and by this unlucky Accident, his Hopes for the future ſeem'd to be quite daſh'd. <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Son of <hi>Chryſermas,</hi> a Favourite of the King's, always carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fairly towards <hi>Cleomenes;</hi> they contracted a near Acquaintance, and would talk freely together about the State.

Deſire came to him, had ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him, upon a few and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Subjects, to avoid ſuſpicion, and made ſome Excuſes for the King; but as he went out again, not knowing that <hi>Cleomenes</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him to the Door, he very ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primanded the Keepers, for their Careleſsneſs in looking after ſo great and ſo furious a wild Beaſt. This <hi>Cleomenes</hi> himſelf heard, and retiring before <hi>Ptolomy</hi> perceiv'd it, told his Friends what he had heard. Upon this they caſt off all their former Hopes, and determin'd for violent Proceedings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to be reveng'd on <hi>Ptolomy</hi> for his baſe and unjuſt Dealing, to have ſatisfaction for the Affronts, to die as it became <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> and not ſtay till, like fatted Sacrifices, they were butcher'd: for 'twas both grievous and diſhonourable for <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> who had ſcorn'd to come to Terms with <hi>Antigonus,</hi> a brave Warriour, and a Man of Action, to wait an effeminate King's leiſure, till he ſhould lay aſide his Fiddle, and end his Dance, and then kill him. Theſe Courſes being reſolv'd on, and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hapning at the ſame time to make a Progreſs to <hi>Canopus,</hi> they firſt ſpread abroad a Report, that his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was order'd by the King; and it being the King's cuſtom, to ſend Preſents and an Entertainment to thoſe whom he would free, <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Friends made that proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:33760:379"/>
and ſent it into the Priſon, thereby deceiving the Keepers, who thought it had been ſent by the King; for he ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd, and gave them large Portions, and with a Crown upon his Head feaſted and made merry with his Friends: 'tis ſaid, that he began the Action ſooner than he deſign'd, having underſtood that a Servant of one of the Accomplices lay abroad with a Miſtreſs that he lov'd. This made him afraid of a Diſcovery; and therefore as ſoon as it was full Noon, and all the Keepers drunk and faſt aſleep, he put on his Coat, and opening the Seam on his right Shoulder, with his drawn Sword in his hand he iſſued forth, together with his Friends, provided in the ſame manner, making 13 in all. One of them, by Name <hi>Hippotas,</hi> was lame, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the firſt Onſet very well; but when afterward he perceiv'd that they were more ſlow in their Advances for his ſake, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd them to run him through, and not ruine their Enterprize, by ſtaying for an uſeleſs, unprofitable Man. By chance an <hi>Alexandrian</hi> was then riding by the Door, him they threw off, and ſetting <hi>Hippotas</hi> on Horſeback, ran through the narrow Lanes, and proclaim'd Liberty to the People; but they, it ſeems, had Courage enough to praiſe and admire <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Daring, but not one had the heart to follow and aſſiſt him.

of them fell on <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Son of <hi>Chryſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> as he was coming out of the Palace, and kill'd him: Another <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the City, advancing againſt them in a Chariot, they ſet upon, diſpers'd his Guards and Attendants, and pulling him out of the Chariot, kill'd him upon the Place. Then they made toward the Caſtle, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to break open the Priſon, and take the Priſoners to their Aſſiſtance; but the Keepers were too quick for them, and ſecur'd the Paſſages. Being baffled in this Attempt, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> with his Company roam'd about the City, none joyning with him, but all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating from, and flying his Approach: therefore deſpairing of Succeſs, and ſaying to his Friends, That it was no wonder that Women rul'd o'er thoſe Men that fled Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he excited them all to die as bravely as became his Followers, and Men of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Performances. This ſaid, <hi>Hippotas</hi> was firſt, as he deſir'd, run through by one of the young Men, and then each of them readily and reſolutely fell upon his own Sword, except <hi>Panteus,</hi> that <hi>Panteus</hi> that firſt ſurpriz'd <hi>Megalopolis.</hi> This Man being a very handſom Perſon, and a better Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than any of the Youth, the King lov'd, and bad him, when he had ſeen him and the reſt fall'n, die by their Example. <hi>Panteus</hi> walk'd over them as they lay, and
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:33760:380"/>
prick'd every one with his Dagger, to try whether any was alive; when he prick'd <hi>Cleomenes</hi> in the Leg, and ſaw him turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Back, he kiſs'd him, ſate down by him, and when he was quite dead, cover'd his Carkaſe, and then kill'd himſelf upon his Body.</p>
            <p>Thus fell <hi>Cleomenes</hi> that great, brave Man, after he had been King of <hi>Sparta</hi> ſixteen Years. The News of their Fall being nois'd through the City, <hi>Crateſiclaea,</hi> though a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a great Spirit, could not bear up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inſupportable weight of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; but embracing <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Children, made grievous Lamentations; but the eldeſt Boy, none ſuſpecting ſuch a Spirit in a Child, threw himſelf headlong from the top of the Houſe; he was bruis'd very much, but not kill'd by the Fall, and was taken up crying, and expreſſing his Reſentments for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to deſtroy himſelf. <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> as ſoon as an Account of the Action was brought him, gave order that <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s Body ſhould be flea'd and hung up; that his Children, Mother, and the Women that were with her, ſhould be kill'd. Amongſt thoſe was <hi>Panteus</hi>'s Wife, a very fair Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and of a ſtately Carriage, who had been but newly married, and ſuffer'd theſe Diſaſters in the height of her Love. Her Parents would not let her embark with <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus</hi>
               <pb n="742" facs="tcp:33760:381"/>
preſently after they were married, though ſhe eargerly deſir'd it, but ſhut her up, and kept her by Violence at home; yet a few days after ſhe got an Horſe and a little Money, and eſcaping by Night, made ſpeed to <hi>Taenarus</hi> where ſhe embark'd for <hi>Aegypt,</hi> came to her Husband, and with him chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endur'd to live in a foreign Country. She led <hi>Crateſiclaea</hi> as ſhe was going with the Souldiers to Execution, held up her Train, and begg'd her to be courageous, who of her ſelf was not in the leaſt afraid of Death, and deſir'd nothing elſe, but only to be kill'd before the Children. When they were come to the Place of Execution, the Children were firſt kill'd before <hi>Crateſiclaea</hi>'s Eyes, and afterwards ſhe her ſelf, with only theſe words in her Mouth; <hi>O Children, whither are you gone?</hi> But <hi>Panteus</hi>'s Wife girded her Garments cloſe to her, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrong Women, without any Noiſe or Lamentation, lookt after every one that was ſlain, and wound them up as well as her preſent Circumſtances would permit; and after all were kill'd, dreſſing her ſelf, bound her clothes cloſe about her, and ſuffering none to come near, or be an Eye-witneſs of her Fall, beſides the Executioner, ſhe cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly ſubmitted to the ſtroak, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no Body to look after her, or wind her up after ſhe was dead. Thus in her Death
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:33760:381"/>
the Modeſty of her Mind appear'd, and ſet that Guard upon her Body, which ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways kept when alive: And ſhe in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Age of the <hi>Spartans</hi> ſhew'd, that Women were no unequal Rivals of the Men, and was on Inſtance of ſuch a Courage as would not ſneak to the Affronts of Fortune. A few days after, thoſe that watch'd the hanging Body of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> ſaw a very great Snake winding about his Head, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Face, ſo that no Bird of Prey would fly at it. This made the King ſuperſtitiouſly afraid, and ſet the Women upon ſeveral Luſtrations, as if he had been an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Man, and one belov'd by the Gods that had been ſlain. And the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> made Proceſſions to the Place, and gave <hi>Cleomenes</hi> the Title of <hi>Hero,</hi> and Son of the Gods, till the Philoſophers ſatisfied them by ſaying, That <hi>as Oxen breed Bees, putrifying Horſes Breed Hornets, and Beetles riſe from the Carkaſſes of dead Aſſes, ſo the Humours and Juices of the Marrow of a Man's Body coagulating, produce Serpents.</hi> And this the Ancients obſerving, appropriated a Serpent rather than any other Creature to Hero's.</p>

There goes a Report, that he once found in his Bed-Chamber a couple of Snakes, and that the <hi>Southſayers</hi> being conſulted concerning the <hi>Prodigy,</hi> adviſed, That <hi>he ſhould neither kill'em both, nor let 'em both eſcape;</hi> ſaying, That if the male Serpent was kill'd, <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſhould die; and if the Female, <hi>Cornelia:</hi> And that therefore <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who extreamly loved his Wife, and thought beſides that it was much more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming him, who was an old Man, to die, than her, who as yet was but a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; kill'd the male Serpent, and let the Female eſcape: And ſoon after himſelf dy'd, leaving behind him 12 Children born to him by <hi>Cornelia.</hi>

<pb n="746" facs="tcp:33760:384"/>
who, when King <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himſelf would have married her, and proffer'd her his Crown, refuſed it, and chooſe rather to live a Widow. In this ſtate ſhe continued, and loſt all her Children except one Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that was married to <hi>Scipio</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and two Sons, <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Caius,</hi> whoſe Lives we are now writing.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſhe brought up with ſo great Care, that tho' they were without diſpute of the nobleſt Family, and had the beſt natural Parts among the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet they ſeem'd to owe their eminent Vertues, more to their Education than their Birth. Now as in the Statutes and Pictures of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> tho' the Brothers reſemble one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet there is a difference to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in their Countenances, between the one, who delighted in the <hi>Caeſtus,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that was famous for managing the Horſe: ſo tho' there was a great Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between theſe two noble Youths, in their common purſuit after Fortitude and Moderation, after Liberality and Eloquence, and greatneſs of Mind; yet in their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Adminiſtrations of publick Affairs, a Diſagreement as great manifeſtly appear'd. It will not be amiſs before we proceed, to ſet down the Difference between them.</p>

                  </note> and his Looks, in his Geſture and Motion,
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:33760:384"/>
was gentle and compos'd; but <hi>Caius</hi> earneſt and vehement: ſo that in their publick Speeches to the People, the one modeſtly uſed very little Action, nor changed his Place; the other would walk about in the <hi>Roſtrum,</hi> and in the heat of his Orations, pull his Gown off his Souldiers, and was the firſt of all the <hi>Romans</hi> that uſed ſuch Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures: As <hi>Cleon</hi> is ſaid to be the firſt Orator among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that pull'd off his Cloack, and ſmote his Thigh, in his Haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues to the Multitude. <hi>Caius</hi> his Oratory was impetuous, and ſo pathetical, that it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Horror in the Auditory; but <hi>Tiberius</hi> was more mild, and apt to move Pity and Compaſſion: in his Words he was pure and natural, yet laborious and accurate; but <hi>Caius</hi> was pompous and figurative. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in their way of Living, and at their Tables, <hi>Tiberius</hi> was frugal, and no affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Variety; but <hi>Caius,</hi> if indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with other Men, moderate enough: but in reſpect of his Brother, too curious a Lover of Rareties, and profuſe; which <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> objected to him, that he had bought<note place="margin">A Drachma is ſeven pence half penny.</note> certain Dolphins of Silver, to the value of 1250 Drachma's, for every pound weight.</p>
               <p>The ſame difference that appear'd in their Speaking, was obſervable alſo in their Tempers: The one was ſmooth and ſedate, the other rough and paſſionate; and to that
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:33760:385"/>
degree, that often in the midſt of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was ſo hurried away by his Paſſion, even againſt his own Will, that he fell to give ill Language; and ſo ſtrain'd his Voice, that he could not proceed in the Speech. For a Remedy to this Exceſs, he made uſe of an ingenious Servant of his, one <hi>Licinius,</hi> who ſtood conſtantly behind him with a <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Pitch-pipe,</hi> or Inſtrument to regulate the Voice by; and when ever he perceived his Maſter's Tone alter, and grow harſh with Anger, he ſtruck a ſoft Note with his Pipe, at the hearing of which, <hi>Caius</hi> immediately bated of the vehemence of his Paſſion and Voice, grew mild, and was eaſily recall'd to Temper. Theſe are the differences between the two Brothers; but their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour againſt their Enemies, their Juſtice to their Countrey-men, their Care and well management of their publick Affairs, and laſtly their Continency againſt Senſuality and Pleaſures, were equally remarkable and alike in both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius</hi> was the elder by nine years, which occaſion'd that their publick Actions were divided, by the difference of the Times, in which thoſe of the one, and thoſe of the other, were tranſacted. This was no ſmall hindrance to their Undertakings; for not coming at the ſame time to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Affairs, they could not joyn
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:33760:385"/>
their Intereſts together, which between them both, had they flouriſh'd at once, muſt needs have been very great, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt irreſiſtable. We muſt therefore give an Account of each of them ſingly, and firſt of the eldeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius,</hi> tho's as yet but a young Man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tiberius</hi> made Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur.</note> was ſo celebrated and eſteem'd, that he was ſoon admitted into the Colledge of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs,</hi> and that with Reſpect had, more to his early Virtue, than his noble Birth. This <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> made appear; who, tho' he had been <hi>Conſul</hi> and <hi>Cenſor,</hi> and was then the chief of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, and excell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Wiſdom moſt of his Quality, at a publick Feaſt of the <hi>Augurs,</hi> addreſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf openly to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Kindneſs, offer'd him his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">He marries <hi>Claudia,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>App-Claudius.</hi>
                  </note> in Marriage; which with much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction embracing, and the Wedding Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being thus ſpeedily concluded, <hi>Appius</hi> went ſtraight home, and calling out his Wife to the Gate, with a loud Voice cry'd out, <hi>O</hi> Antiſtia, <hi>I have contracted our Daughter</hi> Claudia <hi>to a Husband.</hi> She being amazed, anſwer'd, <hi>but why ſo ſuddenly? or what means this haſt? unleſs you have provided</hi> Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Gracchus <hi>for her Husband.</hi> I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that ſome apply this Story to <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> the Father of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> and <hi>Scipio A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus;</hi> but moſt People relate it as we
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:33760:386"/>
have done: And <hi>Polybius</hi> writes, that after the Death of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> the neareſt Relations of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> preferring <hi>Tiberius</hi> to all other Competitors, gave her to him in Marriage, not having being engaged or promiſed to any one by her Father.</p>
               <p>Now this young <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſerving in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> under the Younger <hi>Scipio,</hi> who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Siſter, and converſing under the ſame Tent with his General, ſoon obſerv'd and learn'd his noble Genius, which exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a great emulation of his Virtues, and ſtirr'd him up to the imitation of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in a ſhort time excell'd all the young Men of the Army in his Regular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour and Courage; and he at one Siege was the firſt that mounted the Enemies Wall, as <hi>Fannius</hi> ſays, who writes, that he himſelf climb'd up with him, and was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker in that Action. His preſence created amongſt the Souldiers an extraordinary Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and his departure left a paſſionate deſire of his Return.</p>

<pb n="751" facs="tcp:33760:386"/>
not only the Diſcretion and Valour of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but alſo (which was ſtill more to be admired) the great Reſpect and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which he had from his General, was moſt eminently remarkable: inſomuch that even in the extremity of Danger, he never regarded himſelf, as a principal Officer; for when he was overcome in ſeveral deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Battels, he would leave the main Body of the Army, and in the Night-time ſally out with the Forces under his particular Command. When the <hi>Numantines</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, they immediately poſſeſs'd themſelves of his Camp, purſuing that part of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which was put to flight; ſlew all thoſe that were in the Rear, hedg'd the whole Army in on every ſide, and forcing them into ſuch intricate Places, as that there could be no poſſibility of an Eſcape. <hi>Mancinus</hi> deſparing to make his way through by force, ſent a Meſſenger to deſire a Truce, and ceſſation of Arms; but they refuſed to conclude a Treaty with any one except <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and required that he ſhould be ſent to treat with them. This they earneſtly inſiſted upon, not only in regard to the young Man's Courage, (for he had a great Reputation amongſt the Souldiers) but likewiſe in remembrance of his Father <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who in his Expedition againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> had utterly deſtroyed ſeveral other
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:33760:387"/>
Places, but granted a Peace to the <hi>Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> which he commanded to be always kept punctually and inviolable.</p>
               <p>Upon this Conſideration <hi>Tiberius</hi> was<note place="margin">He makes a Peace with the <hi>Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi>
                  </note> diſpatch'd to the Enemy, whom he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to accept of ſeveral Conditions, and he himſelf complyed with others; and by this means it's evident, that he ſaved 20000 of the <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, beſides Slaves, and thoſe that followed the Army. However the <hi>Numantines</hi> ſeized upon, and deſtroyed all things that were left behind in the Camp; amongſt theſe were <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Books of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, containing the whole Tranſactions of his <hi>Queſtor-ſhip,</hi> upon which he ſet an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary value: And therefore when the Army was already upon their March, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Numantia,</hi> accompanied with only three or four of his intimate Friends, and making his Application to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers of the <hi>Numantines,</hi> he earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreated, that they would return him his Books, leſt his Enemies ſhould thereby take an occaſion to upbraid him, for not being able to give an Account of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys received and disburſed by him. The <hi>Numantines</hi> joyfully embraced this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of obliging him, and kindly invited him into the City; as he ſtood arguing the Caſe wiſh them, they approach'd towards him, took him by the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

begg'd, that he would never again look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as Enemies, but relying upon their Friendſhip, be confident for the future of this their preſent Sincerity. <hi>Tiberius</hi> thought it convenient to believe 'em, becauſe he was deſirous to have his Books return'd, and was afraid leaſt he ſhould diſoblige them, by ſhewing any manner of Diſtruſt. As ſoon as he enter'd into the City, they in the firſt place invited him to a publick Entertainment, and were very earneſt that he would accept of it: Afterwards they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd his Books, and gave him the liberty to take what-ever he ſaw moſt acceptable of the remaining Spoyls. He on the other hand would accept of nothing but ſome Frankincenſe, which he uſed in his publick Sacrifices; and after he had kindly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, and made his Complements, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>When he return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> he found the whole Tranſaction cenſured and reproach'd, as a Buſineſs that was baſe and ſcandalous to the <hi>Romans;</hi> but the Relations and Friends of the Souldiers, which were the greateſt part of the Populace, came flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> whom they acknowledg'd the Preſerver of ſo many Citizens, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted all the Miſcarriages which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, to the General. They who were diſſatisfied with the Proceedings, propoſed<note place="margin">The Peace Broken.</note>

But in this Affair, the Populace ſhewing an extraordinary Kindneſs and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for <hi>Tiberius,</hi> they indeed voted that the <hi>Conſul</hi> ſhould be ſtripp'd, and put in Irons, and ſo deliver'd to the <hi>Numantines;</hi> but they granted a general Pardon to all the others, out of Reſpect only to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> It may be probable alſo, that <hi>Scipio,</hi> who at that time was a leading Man among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> lent him his Aſſiſtance; tho' he was nevertheleſs cenſured for not protecting <hi>Mancinus</hi> too; and that he did not ratifie the Articles of Peace, which had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon by his Kinſman and Friend <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius.</hi> But it's evident, that the greateſt part of theſe Differences did ariſe from the Ambition of ſome deſigning Politicians, who had a Kindneſs for <hi>Tiberius.</hi> However this<note place="margin">

perſwaded, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> would ever have taken thoſe Courſes which he did, if <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> had had any hand in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Affairs: for at the time when he was engaged in the War againſt <hi>Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Tiberius</hi> then ventured to make Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of new Laws, for the better regulation of the Government, upon the following occaſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had by Conqueſt gain'd ſome Lands, adjoyning to the Suburbs, part whereof they ſold publickly, and turn'd the remainder into <hi>Common;</hi> this Common they aſſign'd to ſuch of the Citizens as were poor and indigent, for which they were to pay only a ſmall acknowledgment into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Treaſury: but when the wealthy Men began to raiſe the Rents, and turn the poor People out of their Poſſeſſions, it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted by Law, that no Perſon what-ever ſhould enjoy more than 500 Acres of Ground. This <hi>Act</hi> did for ſome time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Avarice of the richer, and was no ſmall ſupply to the poorer People, who poſſeſs'd their reſpective Proportions of Ground, as they had been formerly rented by them: afterwards the rich Men of the Neighbourhood contrived to get theſe Lands again into their Poſſeſſions, under other peoples Names, and at laſt would not ſtick to claim moſt of 'em publickly in their own.
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:33760:389"/>
The Poor, who were thus deprived of their Farms, would neither liſt themſelves in the <hi>Militia,</hi> nor take any care of the Education of their Children: in ſo much that in a ſhort time there were few Free-men remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all <hi>Italy,</hi> which ſwarm'd with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous company of barbarous Slaves: theſe the rich Men employed about the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Ground, for want of Citizens. <hi>C.

the Mother of the <hi>Gracchi;</hi> but 'twas thought <hi>Sp. Poſthumius</hi> was the chief occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this. He was Contemporary with <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> and very ambitious to gain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of being the better Orator; whom, when <hi>Tiberius</hi> at his return from the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, found to be in very great Eſteem and Authority, he was deſirous to out-do him, by attempting a popular Enterprize of this Difficulty, and of ſuch great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But his Brother <hi>Caius</hi> left it us in Writing, that when <hi>Tiberius</hi> went through <hi>Tuſcany</hi> into <hi>Numantia,</hi> and found the Countreys almoſt depopulated, there being hardly any Husbandmen or Shepherds, and for the moſt part only barbarous foreign Slaves; he from that time took into his ſerious Conſideration, the management of this Affair, which in the ſequel proved ſo fatal to his Family: though it is moſt certain, that the People themſelves chiefly excited him to be active and vigorous in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this, by their fixing publick Libels upon the Porches, Walls and Monuments, humbly beſeeching him, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh them in their former Poſſeſſions.</p>

Never did any Law appear more moderate and gentle, eſpecially being enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt ſo great an Oppreſſion and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice: for they who ought to have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed for trangreſſing the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Laws, and ſhould at leaſt have loſt all their Titles to ſuch Lands, which they had unjuſtly uſurp'd; yet they were order'd notwithſtanding to receive a Gratuity, for quitting their unlawful Claims, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Lands to thoſe right Owners, who ſtood in need thereof. But though this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was managed with ſo much Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and all the former Tranſactions ſmother'd, the People were never the leſs carefull to prevent all Abuſes of the like nature for the future. On the other hand, the money'd Men, and thoſe of great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, were exaſperated, through Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, againſt the Law it ſelf, and againſt the Law-giver, through Anger and Obſtinacy; they therefore endeavour'd to ſeduce the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, inſinuating to them, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had introduced ſuch a diviſion of the Lands, with a deſign only to diſturb the Government, and put all things into a Confuſion.</p>
               <p>But they ſucceeded not in his Project; for <hi>Tiberius</hi> being a Perſon always reſolute in the maintaining of an honourable and juſt

<pb n="761" facs="tcp:33760:391"/>
uſe any ſcurrillous Language, or in their Paſſion to let ſlip any indecent Expreſſion, ſo as to derogate from one another. From whence it's obſervable, how much a good Temper, and an Ingenuous Education does influence and compoſe mens Minds; not onely in their Meetings for Pleaſure and Diverſion, but likewiſe in their Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in their very emulation for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Tiberius</hi> conſidered, that <hi>Octavius</hi> himſelf had offended againſt this Law, and detain'd a great quantity of Ground from the Commonalty, he deſired that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Diſputes might be laid aſide; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly proffer'd for the Publick Good, tho' he himſelf had but an indifferent Eſtate to purchaſe <hi>Octavius</hi>'s ſhare, at his proper Coſt and Charges: But upon the refuſal of this proffer by <hi>Octavius,</hi> he then publiſh'd an Edict, prohibiting all Magiſtrates to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their reſpective Functions, till ſuch time as the Law was either ratified or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by Publick Votes. He further Seal'd up the Gates of <hi>Saturn</hi>'s <hi>Temple,</hi> in which the Publick Treaſury was kept, ſo that the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers could neither take any thing out from thence, or put any thing in. He threaten'd to impoſe a ſevere fine upon ſuch as ſhould preſume to diſobey his Commands, inſomuch that all the Officers for fear of

this Penalty, omitted the exerciſe of their ſeveral Juriſdictions. Upon this account, the Gentlemen of Eſtates put themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mourning, went up and down Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and Dejected; thy enter'd into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and procured <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to murder him; inſomuch that he never went abroad without ſuch a <hi>Tuck</hi> or <hi>Rapier</hi> as Robbers uſe, which the <hi>Latines</hi> call <hi>Dolon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the day appointed was come, and the People Summon'd to give their Votes, the Rich Men ſeized upon the <hi>Ballotting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Boxes:</hi> And carried them away by force, all things being Tranſacted in great Confuſion. For when <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Party appeared ſtrong enough to oppoſe the contrary Faction, and were drawn together in a Body. with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions to do ſo; <hi>Manlius</hi> and <hi>Fulvius,</hi> two of the Conſular Quality, threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Feet, took him by the Hand, and with Tears in their Eyes, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg'd of him to deſiſt. <hi>Tiberius</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the inconveniencies that were likely to ariſe, and having a great Reſpect for two ſuch Eminent Perſons, demanded of them what they would adviſe him to do. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged themſelves Perſons altogether unfit to adviſe in a Matter of ſo great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but earneſtly entreated him to leave it to the Determination of the Senate.

<pb n="763" facs="tcp:33760:392"/>
not bring the Buſineſs to a Period, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the prevalency of the Rich Faction, he then betook himſelf to illegal and unjuſt Methods, endeavouring to deprive <hi>Octavius</hi> of his Tribune ſhip; it being impoſſible for him without that, to get the Law ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed. At firſt he careſs'd him with moſt Obliging Language, and taking him by his Hands, beſeech'd him, that now in the preſence of all the People, he would take this Opportunity to Oblige them, in granting onely that Requeſt which was in it ſelf ſo Juſt and Reaſonable, being but a ſmall Recompence in regard of thoſe many Dangers and Hardſhips which they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone for the Publick Safety. <hi>Octavius</hi> would by no means be perſwaded to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance; whereupon <hi>Tiberius</hi> declared open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſeeing they two were joyntly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the ſame Office, and of equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it would be a difficult matter to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this Difference without a Civil War; and that the only Remedy which he knew, muſt of Neceſſity be the Depoſing one of them from their Office. He deſired therefore that <hi>Octavius</hi> would Summon the People to paſs their Verdict upon him firſt, averring that he would willingly relinquiſh his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity if the honeſt Citizens would conſent to it. But <hi>Octavius</hi> ſtill continued refractary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore <hi>Tiberius</hi> told him plainly, That
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:33760:393"/>
the People ſhould have liberty to vote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, if upon mature Deliberation he did not ſuddenly alter his Mind, and after this Declaration Adjourned the Aſſembly till the next day. When the People were met together again, <hi>Tiberius</hi> placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the <hi>Roſtrum,</hi> and endeavoured a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to perſwade <hi>Octavius:</hi> But all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to no purpoſe, he referred the whole matter to the People, Ordering them to Vote whether <hi>Octavius</hi> ſhould be Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or not; and when ſeventeen of the Thirty five Tribes had already Voted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and there wanted only the Votes of one Tribe more for his final deprivation, a ſhort ſtop being here put to the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Tiberius</hi> vouchſafed to renew his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, embraced and kiſſed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Congregation, begging with all the earneſtneſs imaginable, that he would neither ſuffer himſelf to be expoſed to ſuch Infamy, nor him to be reputed the Author and Promoter of ſuch an odious Project. <hi>Octavius</hi> (they ſay) ſeemed a little ſoftned and moved with their Importunities, and and with his Eyes full of Tears continued ſilent for a conſiderable time: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards looking towards the Eſtates who were gathered together in a Body, partly for ſhame, and partly for fear of incurring their Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he generouſly bid <hi>Tiberius</hi> do what he
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:33760:393"/>
pleaſed. The Law for his Deprivation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus Voted <hi>Tiberius</hi> Ordered one of his Servants, whom he had made a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,<note place="margin">Octavius <hi>Depoſed.</hi>

               <p>And this was a further addition to the Puniſhment, that <hi>Octavius</hi> was dragged out in ſuch an Ignominious manner. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple immediately aſſaulted him with great violence, whileſt the Rich Men ran in to his Aſſiſtance. <hi>Octavius</hi> preſently fled, and without any Attendant eſcaped the Fury of the Rabble, tho'it happen'd that a truſty Servant of his, who had placed himſelf by his Maſter, that he might aſſiſt him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his eſcape, in keeping off the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, had his Eyes ſtruck out, contrary to the intention of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who ran with all haſt (when he perceived the Diſturbance) to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the Rioters.</p>
               <p>This being done, the Law concerning<note place="margin">This Law was again Ratified.</note> the lands was Ratified, and Confirmed, and three Commiſſioners were appointed to make a Survey of the grounds and ſee the ſame equally divided: The Commiſſioners were <hi>Tiberius</hi> himſelf, <hi>Claudius Appius</hi> his Father-in-Law, and his Brother <hi>C.

<pb n="766" facs="tcp:33760:394"/>
were tranſacted by <hi>Tiberius</hi> peaceably, none daring to ſtand in Oppoſition to him; and beſides all this, he chooſe by his own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Authority another Tribune, not as formerly out of the Eminent Nobility, but <hi>Mutius,</hi> one of his own Domeſtick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Upon the account of theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Rich were extreamly offended, and ſtill dreaded, leſt he ſhould grow more Popular; they therefore took all Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Affronting him publickly in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate-Houſe; for when he deſired, as was uſual, to have a tent provided at the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Charge for his uſe, when he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his Expedition to divide the Lands, though it was a favour commonly granted to Perſons employed in buſineſs of much leſs importance, yet was peremptorily refus'd<note place="margin">An <hi>Obolus</hi> is a Penny Farthing.</note> to him; and they would allow him only nine <hi>Oboli</hi> to defray each days Expences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P. Narſica</hi> was the chief promoter of theſe Affronts, and was not afraid to own how much he hated him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the account of his having formerly a very great Eſtate in thoſe Publick Lands, and did not a little reſent it, to be turned out now by force. The People on the other hand were ſtill more and more enraged, inſomuch that a little after this, it happen'd that one of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>'s Friends dyed ſuddenly, and his Body being full of Malignant ſpots, the People
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:33760:394"/>
therefore ran in a Tumultuous manner to his Funeral, crying aloud that the Man was Poyſoned: They took the <hi>Coffin</hi> upon their ſhoulders, and carryed the Corps to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Pile, really believing that the plain Symptoms of Poyſon were eaſily diſcernable, for the Body ſwell'd to a great bigneſs, and ſuch a quantity of Corrupt Humours iſſued out, that the Funeral-fire was extinguiſhed thereby; and when it was again kindled, the Wood ſtill would not burn, inſomuch that they were conſtrained to carry the Corps to another place, where, with much difficulty, it took fire. Beſides this, <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that he might incenſe the People yet more, put himſelf into Mourning, brought his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren amongſt the Crowd, intreated the People to provide for them and their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if he himſelf did now deſpair of his own Security.

But inſtead of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Cuſtom, his common Practice was, to walk the Streets at Mid-night, whilſt mean and inſolent Fellows flock'd to him, and made up his Retinue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Titus Annius,</hi> a Man of no great repute either for his Honeſty or Learning, but a cunning Sophiſter in propoſing cramp Queſtions and returning Anſwers, offered to prove by undeniable Arguments that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
                  <pb n="769" facs="tcp:33760:395"/>
had done unworthily in Depoſing a <hi>Roman Magiſtrate,</hi> whom the Laws ever eſteemed Sacred and Inviolable. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple immediately grew Tumultuous, and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> Summoning a General Aſſembly, commanded <hi>Annius</hi> to appear and maintain that which he had aſſerted: But <hi>Annius</hi> being neither a good Logician, nor pretending much to Oratory, rather betook himſelf to his old way of asking ſome cunning ſort of Queſtions, and deſired that he would propoſe one or two to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> before he entered upon the Chief Argument. This Liberty being granted, and ſilence Proclaimed, <hi>Annius</hi> propoſed this Queſtion. <hi>If you, ſays he, had a Deſign to Vilifie and Defame me, and I ſhould apply my ſelf to any other Magiſtrate for redreſs, and he ſhould come readily to my aſſiſtance, would you for that reaſon fall into an extravagant Paſſion, and put him out of Commiſſion? Tiberius,</hi> they ſay, being much ſurprized at this Queſtion, was wholly ſilent, tho' at other times his aſſurance as well as his Eloquence was always remarkable; yet now upon this account he thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to diſmiſs the Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Afterwards beginning to underſtand that his Behaviour towards <hi>Octavius</hi> did diſguſt the <hi>Populace</hi> as well as the <hi>Nobility</hi> (becauſe the Dignity of the Tribunes ſeemed to be violated, which had always continued till
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:33760:396"/>
that day very Sacred and Honourable) he made a Speech to the People in Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf, out of which it may not be improper to Collect ſome particulars, that we may thereby diſcern what impreſſion ſuch Eloquence was able to make upon an Auditory. <hi>A Tribune, ſays he, of the People</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tiberius's <hi>Speech.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>is Sacred indeed, and ought to be inviolable, becauſe in a manner Conſecrated to be the Guardian and Protector of them; but if he degenerates ſo far as to Oppreſs the People, to retrench their Privileges, and take away all their Liberty of Voting, he then deprives himſelf of that Honourable Station by the neglect of his Duty, for which the Honour was beſtowed upon him; otherwiſe a Tribune might not think himſelf obnoxious, tho' he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the Capitol, or burn the Naval Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certainly when he that is only guilty of ſuch Extravagances as theſe, can't be lookt upon as a good Tribune; much leſs can he be ſo, that dares preſume to diminiſh the Privileges of the People, becauſe he ceaſes from that time to be the Peoples Tribune. Is it not very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, that a Tribune ſhould have Power to Impriſon a Conſul, if the People muſt have no Authority to Degrade him when he uſes that Honour which he received from them, to their detriment: For the Tribunes, as well as the Conſuls, are Elected to that Dignity by the</hi>
                  <pb n="771" facs="tcp:33760:396"/>
                  <hi>Peoples Votes. (But to proceed) the Kingly Government, which comprehends all ſorts of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it ſelf alone, is confirmed with the greateſt and moſt religious Solemnity imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as being a Government which does moſt reſemble that of Heaven. But the Citizens notwithſtanding this, depoſed King</hi> Tarquin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>becauſe of his tyrannical Oppreſſions, and for the Injuſtice of one ſingle Man, the ancient Government under which</hi> Rome <hi>was built, was aboliſh'd for ever. What is there in all</hi> Rome <hi>ſo ſacred and venerable, as the Vestal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, to whoſe care alone the preſervation of the Eternal Fire is committed; yet if their Charity be violated, and their Reputation ſtained, they are buried alive: for when they preſume to commit any Offence againſt their Gods, they inſtantly loſe that Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they claimed as Attendants in their Service; ſo likewiſe a</hi> Tribune <hi>ſhould no longer be reſpected by the People as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon, when he offends againſt that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from whence he derived his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We always eſteem that Perſon legally cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi> Tribune, <hi>who is elected</hi> only <hi>by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of Votes; and is not therefore the ſame Perſon much more lawfully degraded, when by a general conſent of them all, they agree to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him. Nothing is ſo ſacred as religious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; yet the People were never prohibited to make uſe of them, but ſuffered to remove</hi>
                  <pb n="772" facs="tcp:33760:397"/>
                  <hi>and carry them where-ever they pleaſed: they likewiſe, when-ever it has been thought conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, have transferr'd the</hi> Tribuneſhip <hi>as a ſacred Preſent, from one Perſon to another; and if this had been an unuſual thing, yet that Authority could not have been thought unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe ſeveral Magiſtrates have often voluntarily ſurrendred their Commiſſions, or deſired to be diſcharged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe were the principal Heads of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s Apology; but his Friends apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dangers which ſeemed to threaten him, and thoſe Conſpiracies that were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly contrived againſt him, were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the ſafeſt way would be for him to petition, that he might be continued <hi>Tribune</hi> for the year enſuing. Upon this Conſideration he again endeavoured to oblige the People with other Laws, making the years of ſerving in the War fewer than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, in granting the liberty of Appeals from the Judges to the People, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Senators that were Judges at that time, an equal number of ordinary Gentlemen, endeavouring as much as in him lay to leſſen the Power of the Senate; which proceeded rather from Paſſion and Prejudice, than from any rational regard to Equity and the publick Good. When it came to be debated, whether theſe Laws ſhould be ratified, he was preſently ſenſible,
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:33760:397"/>
that his Adverſaries had the moſt Votes, (the People as yet being not got together in a full Body) and in ſuch Caſes, 'twas his Cuſtom to raiſe ſome diſputes with his fellow-Officers, out of deſign only to gain longer time; but failing in that Project too, he at length adjourned the Aſſembly till the day following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius</hi> then went down into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place amongſt the People, and made his firſt Addreſſes to them in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poſture with Tears in his Eyes; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards told them, he had juſt reaſon to ſuſpect, that his Adverſaries would attempt in the Night-time to break open his Houſe, and murder him. This work'd ſo ſtrongly with the Multitude, that ſeveral of them erected Tents round about his Houſe, and kept Guard all night for the ſecurity of his Perſon. By break of day came one of the<note place="margin">Several ill Omens hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to him.</note> 
                  <hi>Southſayers,</hi> who prognoſticate good or bad Succeſs by the pecking of Fowls, and threw them ſomething to eat: the <hi>Southſayer</hi> uſed his utmoſt Endeavours to fright the Fowls out of their Coop; but none of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one would venture out, which flutter'd with its left Wing, and ſtretch'd out its Leg, and run back again into the Coop, without eating any thing. This put <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in mind of another ill Omen, which had formerly hapned to him: he had a very
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:33760:398"/>
coſtly Head-piece, which he made uſe of when he engaged in any Battel, and into this piece of Armour two Serpents crawl'd, laid Eggs, and brought forth young ones; the remembrance of which, made <hi>Tiberius</hi> more concern'd at this, than otherwiſe he would have been. However he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Capitol,</hi> as ſoon as ever he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that the People were aſſembled there; but before he got out of the Houſe, he ſtumbled upon the Threſh-hold with ſuch violence, that he broke the Nail of his great Toe, inſomuch that Bloud guſh'd out of his Shooe. He was not gone very far, before he ſaw two Ravens fighting on the top of a Houſe, which ſtood on his left hand as he paſs'd along; and tho' he was ſurrounded with an infinite number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a Stone happen'd to fall juſt at his Foot, beaten down (as it's probable) by the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: which Accident put a ſtop to thoſe that were the boldeſt Men about him. But <hi>Bloſſius</hi> of <hi>Cuma,</hi> who happen'd to be then preſent, told him, That it would be a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing for <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> and the <hi>Protector</hi> of the <hi>Roman People,</hi> to refuſe (for fear of a ſilly Bird) to promote the Intereſt of his Countreymen, who might reaſonably expect it from him; and that his Adverſaries would not only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:33760:398"/>
this, as the effect of a mean Spirit, but the trick of a Tyrant, who had no other intenſion than to abuſe the generous Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the common People. At the ſame time ſeveral Meſſengers came alſo from <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Friends, to deſire his preſence at the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and to acquaint him, that all things went there according to expectation. Indeed <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s firſt entrance there was very pompous, and he was honourably received; for as ſoon as ever he appeared, his Freinds welcom'd him with loud Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations into the <hi>Capitol:</hi> and when he had taken his Place, they repeated their expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Joy, and took care that no Perſon what-ever ſhould come near him, unleſs thoſe who were his intimate Friends. <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> then began to put the Buſineſs again to the Vote; but nothing was performed with the uſual Decency and Order, by reaſon of the Diſturbance which the Rabble made, by their preſſing forwards to get into the <hi>Capitol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were carried on in this Confuſion, <hi>Flavius Flaccus,</hi> a Senator, ſtanding in a Place higher than ordinary, but at ſuch a diſtance from <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that when he could not make him hear, by reaſon of the tumultuous noiſe, ſignified to him by certain motions of his Hand, that he had a deſire to impart ſomething of Conſequence
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:33760:399"/>
to him in private. <hi>Tiberius</hi> order'd the Multitude to make way for him, by which means (tho' not without ſome difficulty) <hi>Flavius</hi> got to him, and inform'd him, that the Senators, ſeeing they could not prevail upon the <hi>Conſul</hi> to eſpouſe their Quarrel, had at length come to this final Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt themſelves, that he ſhould be aſſaſſinated; and to that purpoſe had a great number of their Friends and Servants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to accompliſh it. <hi>Tiberius</hi> no ſooner communicated this Confederacy to thoſe about him, but they immediately tuck'd up their long Gowns, broke the Halberts which the Serjeants uſed to keep the Crowd off, into pieces, and with thoſe reſolv'd to oppoſe all violent Aſſaultants. They who ſtood at a diſtance wonder'd, and demanded what the occaſion of that Diſorder ſhould be; <hi>Tiberius</hi> knowing that they could not hear him at that diſtance, lifted his Hand to his Head, thereby intimating the great Danger which he apprehended himſelf to be in: his Adverſaries taking notice of that Action, ran preſently to the Senate houſe, and declared, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> deſired the People to beſtow a Crown upon him, and that he might be <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> This being very ſurprizing, <hi>Naſica</hi> preſently demanded of the Conſul, that he would puniſh this <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> and defend the Government, as by
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:33760:399"/>
Law eſtabliſh'd. The Conſul mildly reply'd, <hi>That he would not be Guilty of an unjuſt action; and as he would not ſuffer any Free-man to be put to death, before Sentence had lawfully paſs'd upon him, ſo neither would he protect</hi> Tiberius, <hi>if by his Inſinuation the People ſhould act any thing contrary to Law.</hi> But <hi>Naſica</hi> riſing from his Seat in a great paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Since the Conſul,</hi> ſays he, <hi>regards not the Safety of the Common-wealth, let every one who will defend the Dignity and Authority of their Laws, follow me.</hi> He then caſting the skirt of his Gown over his Shoulder, haſten'd to the <hi>Capitol;</hi> they who bore him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, wrapp'd their Gowns alſo about their Arms, and forc'd their way after him: but upon the account that they were Perſons of the greateſt Authority in the City, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People durſt not obſtruct their going thither, but were rather ſo careful in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding 'em, that they tumbled over one another in haſte. Some had furniſh'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Clubs; others got up the feet of Stools and Chairs, which were broken by the haſty flight of the common People. Thus armed, they made towards <hi>Tiberius,</hi> knocking down all thoſe whom they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to meet with; ſo that the People were ſoon wholly diſperſed, and many ſlain, as they endervour'd to make their eſcape.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſeeing theſe things, thought it his
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:33760:400"/>
beſt way to ſave himſelf by flight: as he was running, he chanc'd to be ſtopp'd by one who catch'd him hold by the Grown; but he preſently getting clear of that, fled in his under-Garments only. In this haſty flight it happened, that falling over thoſe who before had been knock'd down, as he was endeavouring to recover himſelf, one <hi>Publius Satureius,</hi> a Tribune, was obſerved to give him the firſt fatal ſtroke, by hitting<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſlain.</note> him upon the Head with the foot of a Stool: the next Man who ſtruck him, was <hi>Lucius Rufus,</hi> who afterwards boaſted of it, as an honourable Exploit. In this Tumult there were above 300 Men ſlain, with Clubs and Staves only, there being no <hi>Warlike Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> made uſe of. This was the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> that ended with the effuſion of Blood, ſince the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kingly Government; for all former Seditions, which were neither ſmall, nor about trivial Matters, were always amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly compoſed, the two Parties conſtantly ſubmitting to one another, either the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for fear of the Commons, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons out of reſpect to the Senate. And it's probable indeed that <hi>Tiberius</hi> himſelf might then have been eaſily brought to ſubmiſſion, if he had not been proceeded againſt in ſuch a rigorous manner; for he had not at that time above 3000 Men of his
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:33760:400"/>
Party: but it's evident, that this Conſpiracy was fomented againſt him, more out of an averſion and malice which the rich Men had to his Perſon, than for the Reaſons which they commonly pretended againſt him: in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony whereof, we may alledge the Cruelty and unnatural Inſultings which they uſed to his dead Body; for they would not ſuffer his own Brother tho' he earneſtly begg'd the favour, to bury his Corps in the Night, but threw it together with other Carkaſes into the River. Neither did their Cruelty ſtop here; for they baniſhed ſome of his Friends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out legal Proceſs, and ſlew as many of the others as they could lay their hands on: amongſt whom <hi>Diophanes</hi> the Orator was ſlain; they murder'd one <hi>Caius Billius,</hi> by ſhutting him up cloſe in a large Tun with Vipers and Serpents: <hi>Bloſſius</hi> of <hi>Cuma</hi> indeed was carried before the Conſuls, and examin'd touching what had happen'd; who freely confeſſed, That he had never failed to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute what ever <hi>Tiberius</hi> commanded him: <hi>What,</hi> reply'd <hi>Naſica, then if</hi> Tiberius <hi>had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that you ſhould burn the Capitol, would you have burnt it?</hi> His Firſt Anſwer was, <hi>That</hi> Tiberius <hi>never commanded any ſuch thing:</hi> but being preſſed with the ſame Queſtion by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others, he declared, <hi>That if</hi> Tiberius <hi>had commanded it, he would not have thought it an inglorious action to have done it; for he never</hi>
                  <pb n="780" facs="tcp:33760:401"/>
                  <hi>commanded any thing but what he thought for the Peoples Advantage. Bloſſius</hi> at this time was pardoned, and afterwards fled to <hi>Ariſtonicus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> whoſe Fortune being then reduced to a deſperate condition, he kill'd himſelf. However the Senate to mollifie the People after theſe Tranſactions, did not oppoſe the diviſion of the publick Lands, and permitted them to chooſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commiſſioner for that Buſineſs in the room of <hi>Tiberius:</hi> ſo they elected <hi>Publius Craſſus,</hi> who was <hi>Gracchus</hi>'s near Kinſman, becauſe his Daughter <hi>Licinia</hi> was married to <hi>Caius Gracchus;</hi> altho <hi>Cornelius Nepos</hi> ſays, that ſhe was not the <hi>Craſſus</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom <hi>Caius</hi> married, but <hi>Brutus</hi>'s, that triumph'd for his Conqueſts in <hi>Portugal:</hi> but moſt Hiſtorians are of the ſame opinion with us. Afterwards the People were much concern'd for the loſs of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and it was apparent, that they wanted nothing but a convenient opportunity to be revenged, and already threatn'd to bring <hi>Naſica</hi> to his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. The Senate fearing leſt ſome Miſchief ſhould befal <hi>Naſica,</hi> ſent him Ambaſſador into <hi>Aſia,</hi> tho' there was no other occaſion for his going thither. The common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not conceal their Indignation even in the open Streets, but rail'd at him, when-ever they met him abroad, calling him a Murderer and a Tyrant, one who
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:33760:401"/>
had polluted even the Temple it ſelf, with the blood of a Tribune. Upon this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <hi>Naſica</hi> left <hi>Italy,</hi> altho' he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, being the <hi>Chief-Prieſt,</hi> to officiate in all Principal Sacrifices: thus wandring full of Diſcontent and Affliction from one Place to another, he died in a ſhort time after not far from <hi>Pergamus.</hi> It is no wonder that the People had ſuch an averſion to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica,</hi> when even <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> who, though deſervedly belov'd by the <hi>Romans,</hi> was in danger of quite loſing the good opinion which the people had of him, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for repeating when the News of <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s Death was firſt brought to <hi>Numantia,</hi> this Verſe out of <hi>Homer:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And afterwards being ask'd by <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Fulvius,</hi> in a great Aſſembly, what he thought of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Death; he anſwer'd, That he did not at all approve <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s way of Proceeding. Upon which account the People would begin to interrupt him with their Hiſſings, in the middle of his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they never preſumed to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time; and he on the other hand was ſo incenſed at it, that upon this account he reflected very ſmartly upon the People.

Notwithſtanding which, many are of opinion, that he was an humble flatterer of the common People, and more ambitious than ever <hi>Tiberius</hi> had been, of popular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe; but it's certain that he was forc'd upon, not that he courted publick Buſineſs. And <hi>Tully</hi> relates this of him, That when he declin'd all thoſe Concerns, and would have liv'd privately, his Brother appear'd to<note place="margin">His Dream.</note> him in a Dream, and calling him by his Name, ſaid, <hi>To what purpoſe,</hi> Caius, <hi>are all theſe delays; there is no poſſibility of avoiding that Fate, which is deſtin'd for us two, both to live and die alike, in vindication of the Peoples Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caius</hi> was no ſooner arrived in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> but he gave exemplary Proofs of his true Valour; for he not only excelled all the young Men of his Age in his early Actions in doing juſtice to his Inferiors, and in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Obedience and Reſpect to his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Officer, but likewiſe in Diſcretion, Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and Induſtry, he ſurpaſſed even thoſe who were much elder than himſelf.</p>
               <p>It happen'd to be a ſharp and ſickly Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> inſomuch that the General was forc'd to lay an Impoſition upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Towns, to ſupply the Souldiers' with neceſſary Cloths: the Cities ſent an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:33760:403"/>
to <hi>Rome</hi> with a Petition, to be excuſed from that Burthen; the Senate found their Requeſt reaſonable, and order'd the General to find ſome other way of new cloathing the Army. While he was long contriving what courſe to take in this Affair, the Souldiers were reduced to great Extremities; but <hi>Caius</hi> went from one City to another, and by laying before them the reaſonableneſs of that Demand, he ſo far prevailed with them, that of their own accord they cloathed the <hi>Roman</hi> Army. Theſe Tranſactions being carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſeeming to be only the forerunners of popular Ambition, rais'd new Jealouſies amongſt the Senators: and beſides this, there came Ambaſſadors out of <hi>Africa</hi> from King <hi>Micipſa,</hi> to acquaint the Senate, that their <hi>Maſter</hi> out of Reſpect to <hi>Caius Gracchus,</hi> had ſent a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Corn to the General in <hi>Sardinia;</hi> at which the Senators were ſo much offended, that they turn'd the Ambaſſadors out of the Senate-houſe, and made an Order, that the common Souldiers ſhould be relieved, by ſending others in their room; but that <hi>Ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes</hi> ſhould continue upon the Place, and <hi>Caius</hi> alſo, upon the account of his being Treaſurer. But he ſoon finding how things were carried, fell into a great paſſion, and immediately took Shipping for <hi>Rome:</hi> his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance there was ſo unexpected, that he
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:33760:404"/>
was generally cenſur'd, not only by his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but alſo by the Commons, who thought it an unreaſonable thing, that he being <hi>Quoeſtor</hi> ſhould deſert the Army before his Commander. When this Miſdemeanor came to be tryed before the <hi>Cenſors,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired leave to make his Apology; which he did ſo effectually, that his Auditors quickly entertain'd a better opinion of him, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had been very much injured. He made it then appear, that he had ſerv'd 12 years in the Army, whereas others are obliged to ſerve only 10; that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Queſtor</hi> to the General three years, whereas he might by Law have return'd at the end of one year; that none but he in that Expedition carried his own Money to the Army, whereas others firſt took care to drink off the Veſſels of Wine which they carried with them, and then to have them better fill'd with the Riches and Spoyl of the Countrey. After this, they brought other Accuſations and Writs againſt him, for creating Differences among the Allies, and being engaged in the Conſpiracy that was diſcover'd about <hi>Fregella;</hi> but he having clear'd himſelf of theſe things, he not only appear'd wholly innocent of the Crimes laid to his charge, but made what Intereſt he could to be elected <hi>Tribune;</hi> in which tho' he was generally oppoſed by all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:33760:404"/>
of Quality, yet there came ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite numbers of People from all Parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> to vote for <hi>Caius,</hi> that many wanted Lodgings in the City; and the Field being not large enough to contain the Company, there were ſeveral who gave their Votes from Roofs and Battlements of Houſes: however the Nobility did ſo influence the People, and croſs <hi>Caius</hi>'s Expectations, that he was not return'd the firſt, (as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected) but the fourth <hi>Tribune.</hi> When he came once to the execution of his Office, it was ſeen preſently who deſerv'd to have been the firſt <hi>Tribune;</hi> for he was a much better Orator than any of his Co-tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the Concern which he ſtill retain'd for the Murder of his Brother, made him the bolder in ſpeaking. He us'd on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to remind the People of what had happen'd in that Tumult, and laid before them the Examples of their Anceſtors; how they declared War againſt the <hi>Faliſci,</hi> only for giving ſcurrilous Language to one <hi>Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> a <hi>Tribune</hi> of the People; and ſentenced <hi>C. Vulturius</hi> to death, for taking the Wall of a <hi>Tribune</hi> in the Streets: <hi>Whereas,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>theſe Perſons did in the preſence of you all murther</hi> Tiberius <hi>with Clubs, and dragg'd the ſlaughter'd Body through the middle of the City, to be caſt into the River; even his Friends, as many as could be taken, were put</hi>
                  <pb n="788" facs="tcp:33760:405"/>
                  <hi>to death immediately, without any tryal, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that juſt and ancient Cuſtom, which was always obſerved among our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that when-ever any one was accuſed of a capital Crime, and did not make his perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appearance in Court, a Trumpet was ſent in the Morning to his Lodging, to ſummon him by ſound of Trumpet to appear: and before this Ceremony was duely performed, the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges would never proceed to paſs Sentence; ſo cautious and reſerv'd were our Anceſtors about Buſineſs of Life and Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caius</hi> having moved the People with ſuch Speeches (for his Voice was loud and ſtrong) he propoſed two Laws: The <hi>firſt</hi> was, That who-ever was turn'd out of any<note place="margin">His Laws.</note> publick Office by the People, he ſhould be thereby render'd incapable of bearing any Office afterwards. The <hi>ſecond</hi> was, that if any Magiſtrate ſhall condemn a <hi>Roman</hi> to be baniſhed without a legal Trial, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be authorized to take cognizance thereof.</p>
               <p>One of theſe Laws did manifeſtly reflect upon <hi>M. Octavius,</hi> who at the Inſtigation of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> had been depriv'd of his <hi>Tribune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;</hi> The other touch'd <hi>Popilius,</hi> who in his <hi>Praetorſhip</hi> had baniſhed all <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Friends; whereupon <hi>Popilius</hi> being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſtand the hazard of a Tryal, fled out of <hi>Italy.</hi> As for the former law, it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:33760:405"/>
by <hi>Caius</hi> himſelf, who declared his readineſs to oblige <hi>Octavius</hi> for the ſake of his Mother <hi>Cornelia:</hi> this was very acceptable and pleaſing to the People, who had a great Veneration for <hi>Cornelia,</hi> both in reſpect to her Father and her Children; and therefore they afterwards erected a Statue of Braſs in Honour of her, with this Inſcription, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia, the Mother of the Gracchi.</hi> There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Expreſſions in writing, which he uſed perhaps with two much Affectation and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity concerning her, to one of her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries: <hi>How,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>dare you preſume to reflect upon</hi> Cornelia <hi>the Mother of</hi> Tiberius? And becauſe the Perſon who made the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, had been ſuſpected for Sodomy, <hi>With what face,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>can you compare</hi> Cornelia <hi>with your ſelf? have you brought forth ſuch Children as ſhe has done? and yet all</hi> Rome <hi>knows, that ſhe has refrain'd from the Converſation of Men, longer than you your ſelf have done.</hi> Theſe and many other ſuch ſatyrical Expreſſions may be collected out of his Orations: he afterwards propoſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Laws, to raiſe the People's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to detract from the Senate's.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> was concerning the publick<note place="margin">Other Laws preferr'd by C. <hi>Grach.</hi>
                  </note> Lands, which were to be divided amongſt the poor Citizens.</p>
               <p>Another was concerning the common Souldiers, that they ſhould be cloathed at
<pb n="790" facs="tcp:33760:406"/>
the publick Charge, without any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Pay, and that none ſhould be obliged to ſerve in the Army who was not full 17 years old.</p>
               <p>Another gave an equal Liberty to all the <hi>Italians</hi> in general, of voting at Elections, as was granted to the Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another was concerning the price of Bread-corn, which was to be ſold at a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer rate than formerly to the poor People.</p>
               <p>Another was concerning Matters of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, whereby the Authority of the Senate was very much retrenched.</p>
               <p>For only Senators were formerly Judges in all cauſes, by which means their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was very much dreaded by the <hi>Roman</hi> Knights and the People: but he joyn'd 300 ordinary Gentlemen with the Senators, who were 300 likewiſe in number, and ordain'd, that a judicial Authority ſhould be equally inveſted in the 600. While he was arguing for the ratification of this Law, his Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was obſerved to be quite different from others: for all other Orators in their Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, uſed to turn their Faces towards the Senate-houſe, and the Place called <hi>Comiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi> but he, on the Contrary, was the firſt Man that in his Harangue to the People, turn'd himſelf the other way towards them, and after that time always obſerved the ſame poſture. Which however inſignificant that
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:33760:406"/>
Turn might ſeem, yet it was the cauſe of no ſmall one in State-affairs; for he in a manner converted the Government from an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> to a <hi>Democracy,</hi> thereby inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating by that Action, that all Orators in propoſing State-affairs, ought to ſpeak to the People, not the Senate.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Commonalty had ratified this Law, and given him power to elect<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cajus's</hi> Power.</note> thoſe whom he approved of, to be Judges, he was inveſted with ſuch an abſolute Power, that the Senate ſubmitted to conſult with him in Matters of Difficulty; and he always took care to adviſe nothing, that might any ways derogate from a Perſon of his Quality; As for example, his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Bread-corn which <hi>Fabius</hi> the <hi>Propraetor</hi> ſent from <hi>Spain,</hi> was very juſt and honourable; for he perſwaded the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to ſell the Corn, and return the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the ſame Provinces which had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd them with it; and alſo that <hi>Fabius</hi> ſhould be cenſured, for having render'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Government odious and inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Provinces abroad. This Propoſal got him an extraordinary Reſpect and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour amongſt the foreign Provinces; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, he propoſed ways for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopling of ſeveral ruinous Cities, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the High-ways, and for building pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Granaries. Of all which Works he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:33760:407"/>
undertook the Management and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency, and was never wanting to give neceſſary Orders for the quick diſpatch of different and great Undertakings, and that too with ſuch wonderful Expedition and Diligence, as if they had been only one; inſomuch that all Perſons, who either hated or fear'd him, ſtood amazed to ſee how active and induſtrious he was in all his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. As for the People themſelves, they were ſtrangely tranſported at the very ſight of him, eſpecially when-ever they ſaw him ſurrounded with crowds of Labourers, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, Meſſengers, Officers, Souldiers, and Scholars. All theſe he treated with an eaſie Familiarity, yet always took care to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his Dignity, even in his greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcentions, accommodating his Carriage according to the Quality of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſon; by which means he ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, that his Enemies were look'd upon no better than envious Detracters, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they preſumed to repreſent him either dangerous, raſh or guilty of the leaſt ill Nature.</p>
               <p>He had that peculiar Art of inſinuating himſelf, and gaining by degrees upon the Commonalty, that he became rather more Popular by his common Converſation, than by his publick Harangues.</p>
               <p>But his greateſt Endeavour was to put
<pb n="793" facs="tcp:33760:407"/>
the High-ways into good condition, always taking care to make them handſom and pleaſant, as well as convenient; for they were drawn by his Directions, through the Fields, exactly in a ſtraight Line, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with hewn Stone, founded upon great quantities of Sand, brought thither from the Places adjacent for that purpoſe: when he met with any Valleys or deep Holes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by great Floods, he either cauſed them to be fill'd up with Rubbiſh, or Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be built over, ſo well levell'd, that they being of an equal height on both ſides, the whole Work made a beautiful Proſpect. Beſides this, he cauſed the ways to be all divided into Miles, (each Mile containing<note place="margin">The <hi>Italian</hi> Mile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 8 Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.</note> little leſs than eight Furlongs) and erected Pillars of Stone, to ſignifie the diſtance from one Place to another: he likewiſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced other Stones at ſmall diſtances from one another, on both ſides of the way, by means whereof Travellers might get eaſily on Horſeback without Stirrups. For theſe Reaſons the People highly extoll'd him, and were ready upon all occaſions to expreſs their Affection towards him. One day in an Oration to the People he declared, that he had only one Favour to requeſt; which if granted, as he ſhould think it the greateſt Obligation in the World, ſo if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, he would never blame them for the
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:33760:408"/>
refuſal: this Expreſſion made the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that his ambition was to be <hi>Conſul,</hi> and it was generally expected, that he would be both <hi>Conſul</hi> and <hi>Tribune</hi> at the ſame time. When the day for election of <hi>Conſuls</hi> came, and all in great Expectation, to ſee what would be the Event of that days Work, he appeared in the Field with <hi>Caius Fannius,</hi> and made all the Intereſt he could for him, that he might be choſen <hi>Conſul.</hi> This Intereſt was ſo conſiderably uſeful to <hi>Fannius,</hi> that he was immediately choſen <hi>Conſul;</hi> and <hi>Caius</hi> likewiſe was then elected <hi>Tribune</hi> the ſecond time, without his own<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caius</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune</hi> the ſecond time.</note> ſeeking or petitioning for it, but at the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motion of the People.</p>
               <p>When he underſtood that the Senators were his declared Enemies, and that <hi>Fannius</hi> himſelf was none of the trueſt Friends, he began again to flatter the People with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new Laws. He propoſed that a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens might be ſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people <hi>Tarentum</hi> and <hi>Capua,</hi> and that all the <hi>Latins</hi> ſhould enjoy the ſame Privileges with the Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Senate apprehending that he would at laſt grow too powerful and dangerous, took a new and unuſual courſe to alienate the Peoples Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from him, by their gratifying them in things beyond what they could reaſonably expect. <hi>Livius Druſus</hi> was fellow-<hi>Tribune,</hi>
                  <pb n="795" facs="tcp:33760:408"/>
with <hi>Caius,</hi> a Perſon of as good a Family, and as well educated, as any amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and no ways inferior to thoſe, who for their Eloquence and Riches were the moſt famous and moſt powerful Men of that time. To him therefore the chief Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors make their Application, exhorting him to fall upon <hi>Caius;</hi> and that he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf on their ſide in oppoſition to him, not by uſing any force, or oppoſing of the common People, but in gratifying and obliging them with ſuch unreaſonable things, as might otherwiſe very well deſerve to be deteſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Livius</hi> offer'd to ſerve the Senate with his Authority in this Buſineſs; and in order thereunto, enacted ſuch Laws as were in reality neither honourable nor advantageous for the Publick; his whole Deſign being to out-do <hi>Caius</hi> in pleaſing and cajoling the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, (as Comedians do) with obſequious Flattery and Popularity: whereby the Senate gave plain Teſtimonies, that they were not at all diſpleaſed with <hi>Caius</hi>'s management of Affairs, but privately deſigned either to ruine him utterly, or to leſſen at leaſt his Reputation. For when <hi>Caius</hi> propoſed the re-peopling of only two <hi>Colonies abroad,</hi> and mentioned the moſt <hi>conſiderable</hi> Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens for that purpoſe, they accuſed him for abuſing the People; but on the contrary
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:33760:409"/>
were pleaſed with <hi>Druſus,</hi> when he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſending of twelve Colonies abroad, and each to conſiſt of 3000 Perſons, and thoſe too the moſt beggarly Raſcals that he could find. When <hi>Caius</hi> divided the publick Fields amongſt the poor Citizens, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them with a ſmall Rent, annually to be paid into the Exchequer, they were angry at him, as one who pretended to gratifie the People only for his own Intereſt; yet afterwards they commended <hi>Livius,</hi> tho' he exempted them from paying even that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Acknowledgment. Beſides they were diſpleaſed with <hi>Caius,</hi> for giving the <hi>Latins</hi> an equal Power, with the <hi>Romans,</hi> of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Election of Magiſtrates; but when <hi>Livius</hi> propoſed, that it might not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a <hi>Roman</hi> Captain to ſtrike a <hi>Latin</hi> Souldier, they promoted the paſſing of that Law: and <hi>Livius</hi> in all his Speeches to the Mobile, always told them, That he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed no Laws but ſuch as were agreeable to the Senate, who had a particular regard to the Peoples Advantage. And this truly was the only Action during the time of his <hi>Tribuneſhip,</hi> which proved advantageous to the Publick; for the People were by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to ſhew a more than ordinary Love and reſpect to the Senate: and tho' they formerly ſuſpected and hated the principal Senators, yet <hi>Livius</hi> appeas'd and mitigated
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:33760:409"/>
all their former Perverſeneſs and Animoſity, by convincing them, that he had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in favour and for the benefit of the Commons, without their Advice and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. But the greateſt Credit which <hi>Druſus</hi> got for his Kindneſs and Juſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the People, was, That he never ſeem'd to propoſe any Law, either of his own Head, or for his own Advantage; for he committed the charge of ſeeing the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies rightly ſettled, to other Commiſſioners: neither did he ever concern himſelf with the diſtributions of the Moneys; whereas <hi>Caius</hi> was always the principal Man concern'd in ſuch conſiderable Tranſactions.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Rubrius,</hi> another <hi>Tribune</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had propoſed to have <hi>Carthage</hi> again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, which had been formerly demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Scipio,</hi> it fell to <hi>Caius</hi>'s lot to ſee the ſame performed, and for that purpoſe he ſailed into <hi>Africa. Druſus</hi> took this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of his abſence, to inſinuate himſelf ſtill more into the Peoples Affections; which he did chiefly by accuſing <hi>Fulvius,</hi> who wa a particular Friend to <hi>Caius,</hi> and deputed a Commiſſioner with him for the diviſion of the Lands. This <hi>Fulvius</hi> was a Man of a turbulent Spirit, and notoriouſly hated by the Senate; and beſides, he was ſuſpected by others to have fomented a Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and their <hi>Confederates,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:33760:410"/>
to have perſwaded the <hi>Italians</hi> to rebel; tho' there was no other way to prove the truth of theſe Accuſations, than by his being a ſuſpicious Perſon, and of a ſeditious Temper. This was one principal Cauſe of <hi>Caius</hi>'s Ruine; for part of the Envy which fell upon <hi>Fulvius,</hi> was derived upon him: and when <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> happen'd to die ſuddenly, and no outward cauſe<note place="margin">The Death of <hi>Scipio.</hi>
                  </note> of ſuch an unexpected Death appear'd, except ſome marks of Blows upon his Body, which intimated that he had been violently mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, (as we have related in the Hiſtory of his Life) the greateſt part of the Blame was thrown upon <hi>Fulvius,</hi> becauſe he was his mortal Enemy, and that very day had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon <hi>Scipio</hi> publickly in the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; nor was <hi>Caius</hi> himſelf clear from Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion: however ſuch an horrible Murther, and committed too upon the Perſon of one of the greateſt and moſt conſiderable Men in <hi>Rome,</hi> was never either puniſhed or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into thorowly; for the <hi>Mobile</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and hinder'd the Proceedings of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, for fear that <hi>Caius</hi> ſhould be found ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Murder; but theſe things were ſometime after. But in <hi>Africa,</hi> where at preſent <hi>Caius</hi> was engaged in the re-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of <hi>Carthage,</hi> (which he named <hi>Juno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>) many ominous Prodigies which preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Miſchief, are reported to have been
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:33760:410"/>
ſent from the Gods. For the Firſt Enſigns Staff was broken with a violent <hi>Gale</hi> of<note place="margin">Ill Omens happen to <hi>Caius.</hi>
                  </note> Wind, notwithſtanding all the Endeavours of the Enſign to the contrary. Another ſudden Storm blew away the Sacrifices which were laid upon the Altars, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd the whole Platform, by which the bounds of the City were deſcribed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this, the Wolves made an Incurſion, and carried away the very Marks that were ſet up, whereby they deſigned the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of the City. <hi>Caius</hi> notwithſtanding all this, order'd and diſpatched the whole Buſineſs in the ſpace of 70 days, and then return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> underſtanding how <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> was proſecuted by <hi>Druſus,</hi> and that the preſent Juncture of Affairs would not ſuffer him to be abſent; for <hi>Lucius Hoſtilius,</hi> (one who ſided much with the Nobility, and of no ſmall Authority in the Senate, who had formerly ſued to be <hi>Conſul,</hi> but was repulſed by <hi>Caius</hi>'s Intereſt, whereby <hi>Fannius</hi> was elected) was in a fair way now of being choſen <hi>Conſul,</hi> becauſe he had a numerous company of Friends; and it was generally believ'd, if he did obtain it, that he would wholly ruine <hi>Caius</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, whoſe Power was already in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining condition; and the People were not ſo apt to admire his Actions as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, becauſe there were ſeveral others

who every day contrived new ways to pleaſe the People, with which the Senate did readily comply. After his Return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he quitted his Houſe on the <hi>Palatine Mount,</hi> and went to live in a certain Place near to the publick Court, thereby endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make himſelf more popular in thoſe Parts, where moſt of the pitifull and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Inhabitants were lodged. In the next place he endeavour'd to propoſe other Laws, in order to have them ratified by popular Votes; upon which account he conven'd a prodigious number of people from all the adjacent Places: but the Senate perſwaded <hi>Fannius</hi> the <hi>Conſul,</hi> to command all Perſons, who were not Natives and Inhabitants of <hi>Rome,</hi> to depart the City. A new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Proclamation was thereupon made, prohibiting any of the Allies or Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to appear at <hi>Rome</hi> during that time. <hi>Caius</hi> on the contrary publiſh'd an Edict, accuſing the <hi>Conſul</hi> for what he had done, and ſetting forth to the Confederates, that if they would continue upon the Place, they might be aſſured of his Aſſiſtance and Protection. However he was not ſo good as his word; for tho' he ſaw one of his own familiar Friends and Companions dragg'd to Priſon by <hi>Fannius</hi>'s Officers, he notwithſtanding paſſed by, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſting him, or taking any notice of
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:33760:411"/>
him: which he did, either becauſe he was afraid to ſtand the teſt of his Power, which was already decreaſed, or becauſe he (as he himſelf reported) was unwilling to give his Enemies an opportunity, which they very much deſired, of making an Inſurrection. About that time there happen'd likewiſe a Difference between him and his fellow Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers upon this occaſion: A Prize was to be fought before the People in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Place, and moſt of the Officers erected Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds round about, with an intention of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them for Advantage. <hi>Caius</hi> commanded them to take down their Scaffolds, that the poor People might ſee the Sport without paying any thing. But no body obeying theſe Orders of his, he gather'd together ſome Labourers, and overthrew all the Scaffolds, the very night before the <hi>Prize</hi> was to be play'd; ſo that by the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Market-place was clear'd, and the common People had an opportunity of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paſtime <hi>gratis.</hi> Upon this account, the Rable eſteem'd him as a Man of great Generoſity; but he very much diſobliged the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> and the Action was look'd upon as a piece of Raſhneſs, and full of Preſumption.</p>
               <p>This was thought to be the chief Reaſon, that he fail'd of being a third time elected<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Caius</hi> miſs'd of his third <hi>Tribune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>

cauſed falſe <hi>Returns</hi> to be made. But as to this Matter there is not much credit to be given: certain it is, he very much reſented this Repulſe, and behaved himſelf with an unuſual ſort of Arrogance towards ſome of his Adverſaries, who were joyful at this Defeat of his, telling them, That all their Mirth was a <note n="*" place="margin">This ſaying is occaſion'd from a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Herb in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which whoever taſts of, he preſently ſeems to laugh, and in that poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure dies.</note>

<pb n="803" facs="tcp:33760:412"/>
others, that <hi>Cornelia</hi> did not in the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of theſe Actions.</p>
               <p>When the day came, in which <hi>Opimius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to abrogate the Laws of <hi>Caius,</hi> both Parties met very early at the <hi>Capitol;</hi> and the <hi>Conſul</hi> having performed all the Rites uſual in their Sacrifices, on <hi>Quintus Attyllius,</hi> a Serjeant, carrying out the Entrails of the Beaſt, ſpoke to <hi>Fulvius,</hi> and his Friends who ſtood about him, <hi>Ye factious Citizens,</hi> ſays he, <hi>make way for honeſt Men.</hi> Some report, that beſides this provoking Language, he extended his naked Arm towards 'em, which is reckon'd, it ſeems, as a piece of Scorn and Contempt.

This Murther cauſed a ſudden Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation in the whole Aſſembly, and the chiefeſt Men in Authority had their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reſentments of it: as for <hi>Caius,</hi> he was in a great Paſſion, and ſeverely repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome of his own Party, becauſe they had given their Adverſaries a coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pretence to proceed againſt them, which they had ſo long hop'd for. <hi>Opimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> gratefully embracing this occaſion, ſtood up, and excited the People to Revenge; but there happening a great ſhower of
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:33760:413"/>
Rain on the ſudden, it put an end to the buſineſs of that day.</p>
               <p>Early the next morning, the <hi>Conſul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving again ſummon'd the Aſſembly, and whilſt he adviſed with the Senators in the Court concerning publick Affairs, the Corps of <hi>Attyllius</hi> was laid upon a Bier, and brought through the Market-place, being there expoſed to open view juſt before the Senate-houſe, every one expreſſing a great deal of Sorrow and Lamentation. <hi>Opimius</hi> was not at all ignorant, that this was deſign'd to be done; however he ſeem'd to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, and wonder'd what the meaning of it ſhould be: the Senators therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went out, to know the occaſion of it; and ſtanding about the Corps, ſome condoled the Perſon that was ſlain; all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented it is an inhumane and barbarous Action. In the mean time, there were ſome then preſent, who were ſenſible of, and very much reſented this Partiality of the Senators; conſidering, that when they themſelves had not only aſſaſſinated <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> as he was executing his Office in the very <hi>Capitol,</hi> but had alſo thrown his mangled Body into the River; yet that now they ſhould expoſe to open view; that they ſhould bewail and honour with their preſence the Corps of a mean mercenary Fellow, (who tho' he might perhaps die wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

was however in a great meaſure the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it himſelf) and by theſe means to undermine him, who remains the only De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender and Safeguard of the People.</p>
               <p>The Senators after ſome time with-drew,<note place="margin">A Decree of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate againſt <hi>Caius Gracchus.</hi>

to thoſe who are engaged in a Battel) but no body either freely lent him any Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or ſo much as furniſh'd him with a Horſe; tho' he earneſtly deſir'd it, becauſe his Enemies had gain'd Ground, and got very near him: however he had ſtill time enough to hide himſelf in a little Grove, conſecrated to the <hi>Furies.</hi> In that Place,<note place="margin">

               <p>They ſay, that when <hi>Caius</hi>'s Head was cut off, and carried away by one of his Murtherers, <hi>Septimuleius, Opimius</hi>'s Friend, met him, and forc'd it from him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, before the Battel began, they had made Proclamation, that who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ever ſhould bring the Heads either of <hi>Caius</hi> or <hi>Fulvius,</hi> he ſhould, as a Reward, receive their weight in Gold. <hi>Septimuleius</hi> therefore having fix'd <hi>Caius</hi>'s Head upon the top of his Spear, came and preſented it to <hi>Opimius</hi> the <hi>Conſul.</hi> They preſently brought the Scales, and it was found to weigh above 17 pounds. But in this Affair, <hi>Septimuleius</hi> gave as great ſigns of his Knavery, as he had done before
<pb n="811" facs="tcp:33760:416"/>
of his Cruelty; for having taken out the Brains, he fill'd the Scull with Lead. There were others who brought the Head of <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> too; but being mean, inconſiderable Perſons, were turn'd away without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Reward. The Bodies of theſe two Perſons, as well as of the reſt who were ſlain, to the number of 3000 Men, were all thrown into the River; their Goods were forfeited, and their Widows forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to put themſelves into Mourning: but they dealt more ſeverely with <hi>Licinia, Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s Wife, and wrong'd her even of her Joynture; and as an addition ſtill to all their Inhumanity, they barbarouſly murder'd <hi>Fulvius</hi>'s youngeſt Son; his Crime was not, that he took up Arms againſt 'em, or that he was preſent in the Battel, but becauſe he had propoſed Articles of Agreement: for this he was firſt impriſon'd, then ſlain.</p>
               <p>But that which enraged the common People beyond all theſe things, was, becauſe at this time (in memory of his Succeſs) <hi>Opimius</hi> built the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Concord,</hi> as if he glory'd and triumph'd in the Slaughter of ſo many Citizens: wherefore ſome body in the Night time, under the Inſcription of the Temple, added this Verſe:</p>

She was very much reſpected and beloved, and kept open houſe for the Entertainment of all Strangers, having daily a great number of <hi>Grecians</hi> and learned Men, who reſorted thither: nor was there any foreign Prince but received Gifts from her, and preſented her again. Thoſe who were moſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with her, were much diverted, when er'e ſhe pleaſed to entertain 'em with any Relation concerning her Father, <hi>Scipio A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican,</hi> or his way of Living. But it was very ſurprizing, to have her make mention of her Sons, without any Tears or Sign of Grief; and to give a full Account of all their Deeds and Misfortunes, as unconcern'd, as if ſhe had been relating the Hiſtory of ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heroes. This made ſome imagine, that Age, or the greatneſs of her Afflictions, had made her delirous, and wholly inſenſible of all her Calamities: but they who were of that opinion, had no Notion at all, how much a noble Birth, or a good Education,
<pb n="814" facs="tcp:33760:418"/>
could conquer any Affliction; and tho' en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious<note place="margin">The power of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> Fortune may often be more ſucceſsful, and may ſmother virtuous Actions; yet with the worſer Calamities, ſhe can't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave us of that tranquillity of Mind, by which we generouſly bear them.</p>

               <head>THE COMPARISON OF TIBERIUS &amp; CAIUS GRACCHI, with AGIS and CLEOMENES.</head>
               <p>WE having given an Account ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of theſe Perſons, it remains only, that he ſhould take a View of them, in Compariſon with one another.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Gracchi;</hi> the greateſt Detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and their worſt Enemies, could not but allow, that they had a Genius to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, beyond all other <hi>Romans,</hi> which was inproved alſo by a generous Education. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> ſeem'd to have had better natural Parts, and a more ſolid Judgment; for tho' they wanted all the Advantages of good Literature, and were neither inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Morality, nor the well management of their Affairs, (from which, even thoſe who were elder than they, had already much dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated)
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:33760:419"/>
yet they were publick Examples of Temperance and Frugality.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the <hi>Gracchi</hi> happening to live, when <hi>Rome</hi> had her greateſt repute for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and virtuous Actions, might juſtly have been aſhamed, if they had not inherited the Virtues of their Anceſtors: whereas the other two had Parents of different Morals; and tho' they found their Countrey in a ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, and debauch'd, yet that did not quench their forward Zeal to what was juſt and honourable.</p>
               <p>The Generoſity and the Integrity of the two <hi>Romans,</hi> was chiefly remarkable in this, That in the adminiſtration of publick Affairs, they kept themſelves from the imputation of Bribery: whereas <hi>Agis</hi> might juſtly be offended, if he had only that mean Commendation given him, that he took nothing wrongfully from any Man, being he diſtributed his own Fortunes, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted in ready Money to the value of 600 Talents, amongſt his fellow-Citizens; and ſurely extortion muſt appear a Crime of a ſtrange nature to him, who eſteem'd it a piece of Covetouſneſs, to poſſeſs, tho nee'r ſo juſtly gotten, greater Riches than his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>Their Politicks likewiſe, and Tranſactions, in reference to State-affairs, were of a very different nature. The chiefeſt things in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:33760:419"/>
that the two <hi>Romans</hi> commonly aim'd at, was the repairing of Cities, and mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of High-ways; and in particular, the moſt generous Deſign which <hi>Tiberius</hi> is fam'd for, was his diviſion of the Lands amongſt the poor People; and <hi>Caius</hi> gain'd his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Reputation, by the addition of 300 of the Commonalty to the ſame number of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, inveſting them with an equal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Alteration which <hi>Agis</hi> and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> made, was in a quite different manner. They did not redreſs things by little and little, and cure ſmall Diſtempers; for that would have been (according to <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>) like cutting off one of the <hi>Hydra</hi>'s Heads, which was the only means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number: but they made a thorough Reformation, and at once freed their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from all Grievances; or to ſpeak more truly, they took away thoſe things, which were the cauſe of all their Calamities, and ſo reſtor'd their City to its ancient Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.</p>
               <p>However this muſt be confeſs'd in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> That their Undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were always oppoſed by Men of the the greateſt Quality. But on the other ſide, thoſe which were firſt attempted by <hi>Agis,</hi> and afterwards conſummated by <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> were ſupported by the famous Authority of
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:33760:420"/>
thoſe ancient <hi>Laws</hi> concerning <hi>Frugality</hi> and <hi>Levelling,</hi> which were inſtituted by <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> ratified and confirmed by <hi>Apollo.</hi> It is alſo further obſervable, That from the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> the City of <hi>Rome</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no Additions to her former Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; whereas by the Conduct of <hi>Cleomenes Greece</hi> preſently ſaw, that <hi>Sparta</hi> exerted the ſoveraign power over all <hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and ſhe ſtill ſought to enlarge her Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with the greateſt Princes of that Age; deſigning by all her warlike Actions, to ſet <hi>Greece</hi> at liberty, from her ſubjection to the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and reſtore her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as formerly, to the Race of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From their different manner of Dying, we may alſo make ſome Obſervations, in relation to their Courage. The <hi>Gracchi</hi> fighting with their fellow-Citizens, were both ſlain, as they endeavour'd to make their Eſcape; but <hi>Agis</hi> willingly ſubmitted to his Fate, rather than any Citizen ſhould be in danger of their Lives. <hi>Cleomenes</hi> alſo after his being affronted and abuſed, tho' he did deſign to be revenged, yet having fail'd of that opportunity, he then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly fell by his own Hand.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary we muſt conſider, That <hi>Agis</hi> never did a great Action, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Commander, being prevented by an
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:33760:420"/>
untimely Death. And as for thoſe heroick Actions of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> we may juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with them that of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s, when he was the firſt who attempted to ſcale the Walls of <hi>Carthage,</hi> it being look'd upon as no mean Exploit. To which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded likewiſe the Peace which he concluded with the <hi>Numantines,</hi> by which he ſaved the Lives of 20000 <hi>Romans,</hi> who otherwiſe had certainly been cut off. And <hi>Caius,</hi> not only at this Place, but in <hi>Sardinia</hi> too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf very valiantly; that their early Actions were no ſmall Argument that afterwards they might have been deſervedly compared with the chiefeſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders, if they had not dyed ſo young. <hi>Agis</hi> proceeded very mildly in the management of publick Affairs; and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too with ſome Diſappointments by the Craft of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> he fruſtrated the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Citizens, as to the <hi>diviſion</hi> of the <hi>Lands,</hi> and was conſtrained to leave all his Deſigns imperfect and unfiniſh'd, only for want of a manly Reſolution. <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> on the contrary acted more boldly and raſhly in all his publick Tranſactions, and unjuſtly ſlew the <hi>Ephori,</hi> whom he might by Conqueſt have gain'd over to his Party, or elſe might eaſily have baniſh'd, not only them, but ſeveral others alſo of the City; for to cut off any Members, unleſs in the
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:33760:421"/>
extreameſt neceſſity, is neither the part of a good <hi>Chirurgeon,</hi> nor a <hi>Politician,</hi> but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues unskilfulneſs in both. By this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cleomenes</hi> appears cruel, as well as unjuſt.</p>
               <p>Neither of the <hi>Gracchi</hi> were forward to be engaged in a Civil War: and <hi>Caius</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have avoided all manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, even when his Life was aim'd at, ſhowing himſelf always valiant againſt a foreign Enemy, but wholly unactive in a Sedition. This was the Reaſon that he went from his own Houſe unarm'd, and was preſent in the Battel; which makes it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he had conſulted rather, not to do any harm to others, than not to ſuffer any himſelf. Even the very flight of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> muſt not be look'd upon as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their mean Spirit, but an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Retreat from endangering of others; for if they had ſtay'd, they muſt either have yielded to thoſe who aſſail'd 'em, or elſe have ſought 'em in their own defence. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Crime that can be laid to <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s charge, was the depoſing of his fellow-<hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune,</hi> and that he afterwards ſubſtituted <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius</hi> in his room: and as for the Death of <hi>Attyllius,</hi> it is falſly and unjuſtly attributed to <hi>Caius;</hi> for he was ſlain unknown to him, and much to his Grief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="821" facs="tcp:33760:421"/>On the contrary, <hi>Cleomenes</hi> (not to mention the Murther of the <hi>Ephori</hi>) ſet all the Slaves at liberty, and govern'd by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone in reality, having a Partner only for ſhow; which was the Reaſon he made choice of his Brother <hi>Euclid,</hi> who was of the ſame Family. He alſo prevail'd upon <hi>Archidamus,</hi> (who was the next Heir to the Kingdom of the other Line) that he would venture to return home from <hi>Meſſene;</hi> but after this being ſlain, becauſe <hi>Cleomenes</hi> did not endeavour to revenge his Death, he gave an occaſion of being juſtly ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he was privy to it himſelf. Truly <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> whoſe Example he pretends to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, after he had voluntarily ſettled his Kingdom upon <hi>Charilaus</hi> his Brother's Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fearing leſt if the Youth ſhould chance to die by Accident, he might be ſuſpected for it, he travell'd a long time, and would not return again to <hi>Sparta,</hi> till <hi>Charilaus</hi> had a Son, and an Heir to his Kingdoms. But we have ne'er another <hi>Grecian,</hi> who is worthy to be compared with <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> for amongſt the Deeds of <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> there were greater Innovations, and worſe Faults than theſe.</p>
               <p>They therefore who ſtrictly examine their different Manners, may obſerve, That the two <hi>Grecians</hi> were warlike even from their Youth, and inclining to be Tyrants; that <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Caius</hi> by nature had too
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:33760:422"/>
great an Emulation after Glory and Honours: and beſides, they never ſtood in Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for any thing; but as ſoon as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention began with their Adverſaries, their Heat and Paſſions would ſo far prevail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their natural Temper, that by them, as by ill Winds, they were driven afterwards to all their raſh Undertakings. What could be more juſt and honourable, than their firſt Deſign, had not the Power and the Faction of the Rich, by endeavouring to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate that Law, engag'd 'em both in thoſe fatal Quarrels; the one, for his own Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; the other, to revenge his Brother's Death, who was murder'd without any Law or Juſtice?</p>
               <p>From the account therefore which has been given, you your ſelf may perceive the Difference; which if it were to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd of every one ſingly, I ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>Tiberius</hi> to have excell'd 'em all in Virtue; that young <hi>Agis</hi> had been guilty of the feweſt Miſcarriages; and that in Action and Boldneſs <hi>Caius</hi> came far ſhort of <hi>Cleome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
